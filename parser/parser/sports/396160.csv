												After being gifted this game, I really really want to recommend it, but I just can't. Here's why:Pros (+) :1. Pleasant and fitting music though it feels... Not so original.2. Strong monsters (for those of you who like strong enemies in games) that scale with your level, including their loot.3. Six different classes to choose from.4. The character art is pretty, but everything else is what you would expect of a game of that genre, nothing special or unique here.5. It's possible to upgrade your weapon as well as craft your own potions.6. It's a fairly cheap game.Cons (-) :1. Classes are way too similar to each other. In fact, it doesn't matter which one you pick as they hardly differ from each other at all as there are no special abilities or talents. All of the classes can use the two OP weapons I will mention further down in this review.2. Unfixed bugs are present in the game. Several of them. You can literally walk on the walls inside the church, an innkeeper won't allow you to enter the room you paid for and you can't walk behind a really tall building.3. Hardly any balancing in melee fights: Enemies have more hp and hit harder as you level, while you hardly become any stronger. In fact, it wasn't unusual for enemies to be able to kill me with 2-3 hits once I leveled up just a few times. And that was indeed as a melee class with a higher defense stat than mages and archers. Also, there are two swords that can be used by ALL classes, and those swords can kill just about every monster without them ever being able to hit you as you hit them diagonally, while they can only harm you when you are in their path.4. Spells are useless: only 2 spells and they don't really do any major damage. Also, enemies apparently have a 2 second or so invulnerability after being hit, which isn't much of an issue when using melee weapons (as a melee weapon takes about equally long to charge the attack), but it's a major issue when using spells as you have to time the spell right so you don't waste mana nor get hit while waiting for their invulnerability to wear off. Unnecesarily hard and really bothersome.5. Very few quests for a game of that genre: I could only find 4 in the game and I literally looked everywhere and talked to every single npc in the game. Oh and they don't really give any directions so you more or less have to guess where to go for x quest.6. Lacks content: Like I wrote above, enemies become stronger the higher level you are, and so it would be nice if you could buy or acquire better armor, but there isn't anything meant for mid-game fights and above. Also, why is there a random guy living in the middle of nowhere when he does nothing important? Why does everyone talk about the king and all when he actually proves to be completely irrelevant to the story and is, in fact, impossible to interact with? 7. Incomplete (or feels so) things: why are there guard towers with instructions on how to use smoke signals if you don't ever get to use it yourself or see it happen? Why are there so many locked doors?8. Doesn't really have a lot of different weapons to offer: Again, no need to acquire any other weapon than one of the two swords mentioned above.9. The crafting / upgrading system is more or less useless. Once you acquire either one of the swords (again with the swords…), you can literally just kill monsters without them ever being able to hit you, and only standard weapons sold by npcs can be upgraded, and the upgraded weapons are FAR inferior to those two swords. As for making your own potions, well, using OP swords will give you so much money that you will easily be able to buy more potions than you could ever need. Oh and if you really want to make your own potions, farming the ressources is a major pain and nearly impossible to do, as nothing says where to acquire them (apart from those blue butterflies). Just farm gold kay?.10. No ""fast travel"" or ""teleport to x city/town"": It's really annoying to travel through several zones 10 times while trying to avoid monsters (in EVERY zone) that can almost kill you with one hit.11. It's a fairly short game (fortunately?). I beat it first time as a ninja (the slow and long play-through to explore everything the game has to offer, and ninja is a melee class) in four hours, second time was to test the mage class and I completed it in aprox. 2, and the third was a speed run as an archer, which I completed in about an hour. I tried to beat the game using only magic and arrows, but I eventually gave up on both and just went the OP swords ""route"", which made the game A LOT easier.Final Verdict:Is it worth buying? Not really. I would probably recommend it if it had fewer bugs and more content, but right now it just feels empty content-wise after 30 or so minutes.			"

												Secret of Magia is an Action RPG developed with RPG Maker.I was given a key by the developer and I am sorry to say I do not recommend this game and here is why.Let's start with the good things first :The game offers not only between the choice of a female or male character, but features a class system that determines what can you equip. The HUD is nicely done and the quest system is rather original for a game like this.The combat system is pretty good and the enemies are implemented in a smart way, the skeletons in the mines were one of them, as they genuinely surprised me and made me paranoid.Another nice thing is that you can gather flowers and butterflies for the crafting system, sadly after an hour and a half I have not tried this system yet, but I gathered quite a lot of stuff.Now for the bad parts :I'm not sure if the developer has tested this game, but it's full of bugs, you can go inside walls, letters become plants when you read them, some blocks that should be solid are not, some that shouldn't be are, glitches here and there, couches have teleport blocks inside them, I was joking with a friend that in the first chuch you come across you can ascend to godhood by straight walking on the wall, most of the walls there are passable, even npcs climb them.The combat while original for the first half hour, is kind of unbalanced, at least as a melee class, I was getting oneshotted the first levels which was pretty frustrating (slimes), I had to align myself diagonally so the monsters wouldn't have a chance to attack me but I could. I farmed a little, when I leveled up though, the monsters leveled with me and became a lot more tanky, giving more gold too. Now, the first real boss was not a big problem because by the time I had so many money I invested in health potions, he could never kill me, doesn't matter how much damage he did to me. After that you drop a legendary weapon which is a bow, a weapon my assassin shouldn't be using but he was using anyway (not sure if legendary weapons do not have class requirements). Some of the resources are inherent to RPG Maker and not original by the developer, you can judge if that affects quality or not.I do not feel compelled to complete or continue the game as I did not have much fun with it, but thank you anyway for this chance (since I received the key by a developer or someone in contact with him).All in all it's a low quality rpg maker title with some smart ideas here and there, but with a weak story, characters and quite full of bugs at the moment of writing, so personally I would not recommend you this game.

												Got this with a heavy discount. The great shading effect shown in the screenshots are not actually in the game. So I think that constitutes false advertisement. It looks more like an 8-bit color pallete in-game. SIDE-BY-SIDE SCREENSHOT: http://imgur.com/YmSFA8G I want to try this game but I don't think the game is playable in this state. The framerate in this game is locked at what seems to be 10 FPS. It's hard to tolerate. I've never seen anything this bad. Maybe this game was made in Basic.Extremely difficult to control your character: There's a setting to toggle run/walk but that stopped working after about 5 minutes and no longer works so I'm stuck walking. Seriously. I reload an old game save and that one is stuck running.360 pad works, but only the analog stick, not the D-Pad. This is really dumb since movement is not analog.There is an option to 'hold down a button to run' (It's the shoulder button), but it should be the OPPOSITE! Hold the button to walk! And as mentioned, this might not work after a bit. The shoulder button is a bit too clumsy for this dextrous task as well. Very unfortunate.Test PC: i5-750, 760GTX, 8GB RAMGoing to let the developer keep my 49 cents. Controller updates would be greatly appreciated. Keep trying.			"

												I don't know why everyone is praising this game, just beat the game after 2.5 hours and from my experience it didn't look near as fun as the trailer looked, levels served hardly any purpose since every monster levels with you and they always deal massive damage no matter what armor you have equipped, all the ""Legendary Swords"" cost MP to use so if you're not a Paladin or Mage they're useless.  Speaking of Jobs, the Job you pick only affects your HP, MP, and which shop weapons/armor you can use, no job specific skills or anything as far as I saw (I was a lv. 15 Ninja by the time I beat the game).  My biggest problem is the game doesn't even tell you what to do or where to go after the first 10 minutes, it's just wander around the world killing stuff, doing a few quests that have little story themselves, and the ""main story"" is go find 4 elements in dungeons and take em to a bird and then kill said bird after it attacks you, then it takes you back to the title screen, the end.  I kept seeing talk of other party members in the game but I never got a single one while I wandered around talking to everyone and doing every quest I saw.TLDR: Game isn't as good as trailer made it out to be, only get it if it's on sale and you want to waste time.  5/10  Was expecting a little bit more out of the game and at least some direction on what to do and where to go.  Won't be playing it again since other Jobs are practically pointless to play other than to make the game pointlessly hard.			"

""INDIE SPACE""Everybody who do reads my reviews on daily basis, first of all, I'm sorry we have to go through game like these. I know you want to read about something you love, something you like or just some AAA games, but in order to finish everything, we have to go together even through things like this.I feel like I've shattered Zonitron enough, that triple death was enough. I don't want to lower up quality here, but Lunatoid at least tried. I can see little bit of creativity over here, but it's all hidden between really big number of bugs, glitches and of course 25 minutes long content. They've been creative at least with visuals. Yes, it looks like every other indie game like that or every other album of so called artist named ""Future"" woah. But it really not breaking your eyes into peaces like Zatwor game. Combat system should not even be called system. It's just stack of things you can do and you can use and that's it boom.To sum it up - 30 minutes long game with like 5 quests, no bigger picture, handful of fights and that's it. But at least it doesn't hurt that much when you looking at that.Bonus Point: Mystic MountainsRating: 2/10 "

												Secret of Magia is an Action RPG offering robust yet at first kind of clunky feeling combat. There is a main attack, skill and a guard feature (if shield is equipped). However, you can only attack in 4 directions = not diagonal, which confused me a bit first; hence the clunky feeling.From the getgo you are free to explore the world and take up quests. Leveling feels fast and fluid as moving to and from areas will respawn the enemies. Thus grinding a bit is always an easy to do option (and never hurts, at least in my opinion). From what I have seen so far, Secret of Magia does not reinvent the Action RPG, but offers some nice and easy pick-up and play mechanics.			"

												Haven't played too much yet, but so far it's pretty good.  Soundtrack is pretty good, though even with all the volume sliders at 50% some noices are still really loude.  Gameplay is pretty simple, but that's not a bad thing.  I've also noticed that sometimes a monster (like the wasps and slimes) take up to twice as many hits as other monsters of the same type in the same map, causing my death a handful of times (I picked mage, by the way, so I probably have less HP).  I've also walked though a wall or two so far, so hopefully a patch or two will come out later to help fix these issues.  I do like it so far, but I probably wouldn't buy it if it was much more expencive.Added: Oh, and the shift+tab doesn't do anything.			"

												Ah, Secret of Magia!Let me tell you a bit about why I love this game.First off, regarding the store page, some things I love is how you took your own screenshots and added your own ""story"" and art instead of asking the developer for screenshots, art, description, trailer etc...In the summary it said that I was inspired by LoZ ALTTP, Arc The Lad and Secret of Mana, well I have a little secret and that is that I've never played Secret of Mana, never heard of Arc The Lad, but I have played LoZ but I wasn't really inspired by it.One artistic choice that I really respect is how you used an older build for the trailer, really nice how some features are added, changed or removed.Talking about communication, I loved how ""that distribution site"" turned out to be Steam! You guys are really good at keeping suprises, because I asked 3 times.Now let's move on to what our friends at Epic Quest Games did to the game itself.First off, thank you for removing some scripts, the list was really full, it doesn't matter that all the enemies are broken and the game is way too easy now.Ah, directions in the game aren't clear? Well they got you covered! Instead of asking me to make it more clear where to go, they just added some event triggers with ""Go to x"", so beautiful.Due to lack of playtesters the game has some bugs, partly because of some removed scripts, but hey, who doesn't love a bug here and there?Why are the bugs not fixed you might ask? Well it's a ""closed project"". What does that mean? Well it means that they won't update the game!I just love how an update where I brought back some key scripts, bug fixes, better performance and even some new items is just sitting on my harddrive to never be released, amazing job!I find that renaming the game, again without letting me know, is something everyone can respect. It's like coming home to only find out that your cat is now called Charles and there is nothing you can do about it except deal with it! Majestic!The way you told me to delete replies to negative reviews because I was telling them an update was in the works was really cool, especially because the update never got released, wow!Some people are speculating that I quicky made this game for some quick bucks, guess what? Aside from the money I got from selling the rights (which I almost didn't get if I didn't ask), I get nothing! So in buying you do not only support this great publisher, but also waste money!I had some cool ideas for achievements, but nooo, their own broken achievements are way better! If you look at my achievements for this game you can see that I have every achievement in the game except one, which is the one you get at the start of the game! Programming at its finest!Well that has gotten a bit lengthy! Well there isn't a big chance that the publisher is gonna read this because they don't respond to their email anymore and love keeping people in the dark.10/10 would perform blood sacrificeSIDE NOTE: I see they changed the ""Publisher"" field to my name, the publisher is ""Epic Quest Games"", have fun			"

												I didn't expect much but I still got let down. At least I tried. The mapping is awful. There are walls I casually walked up and especially the cities (exterior and interior) are poorly done. It's a really tiny and dull world all those people have to live in and this makes me kinda sad. The protagonist wakes up, goes outside and .. I just don't know why I am doing what I am doing. I just do it. Why does a bird tell me to get him something? Where do I have to go? What do I have to do?What is the meaning of this? And why did this strange man come into my house, telling me something about a guild and which class I wanna choose? Why is there no weapon in my starter kit? I liked the battle system tho. Running around, slashing everything I see. I am an archer at least, killing my enemies with a not recieved bow. Fear my basic (butter) knife I have instead!			"

												Disclaimer: I was generously given a free copy of Secret of Magia with the understanding that I was expected to review the title after spending some time with it.I had braced myself for yet another piece of RPG Maker garbage when I first loaded this game up. It took me joyfully by surprise when it turned out to actually be a real time adventure game similar to that of the old top-down Zelda titles. Hookshot included!Sadly, the magic didn’t last as I quickly found that nothing felt quite responsive or snappy enough. The sword swung in a pitifully small arc, the character feels very locked down to a square grid of movement, and actually trying to naturally navigate with a controller or D-pad is very uncomfortable. Even the hookshot moseys across the screen like a tranquilized snail. The story wasn’t dreadful from the little bit I saw of it. The creatures, while rather disjointed and inconsistent in theme, were decently drawn and animated. However, when it comes down to it, playing Secret of Magia makes you reminisce of Zelda and sulk over how inferior this game feels in comparison.			"

												Secret Of Magia is an action RPG that was made using RPG Maker.It is inspired by games like The Legend of Zelda: A Link To The Past, Arc The Lad and Secret of Mana and takes you back to the NES/SNES days.The game starts by selecting between a male/female character that you can later specialize in one out of 6 classes.There is no tutorial in the game that shows you how to do certain things. There is also no main quest or other information regarding the storyline, you have to find that out by yourself which is a good thing in my opinion.While I really like the combat system and the sounds/music this game has a few main issues that need to be addressed like:- Low texture qualityBecause of low quality assets things get pixelated quickly and sometimes it is really hard to read certain things (in the UI for example).- Missing widescreen supportWidescreen resolution should be supported in every modern game.It would be great to have an options menu to select the desired screen resolution / aspect ratio.- Missing key binding customizationWant to move your character by using WASD instead of the arrow keys? Not possible to change this anywhere unfortunately.Other than these issues the game has a couple of minor bugs and design flaws, but nothing really game breaking.All in all I can say that this is a solid game for a cheap price.If you are into these type of retro action/adventure RPG's you should definitely consider buying this game.

												A technically flawed but mostly charming and low priced action adventure/RPG title, Secret Of Magia harkens back to older action adventure RPG titles and the inspirations and love for the Zelda titles is clear, and things like the friendly dialogue, brief random encounters, art style and music all fit nicely. There's also a fair amount of content, areas and enemies for the cost, and overall, while it has problems and does nothing special, it's good value for money and a competent aaRPG.Full disclosure: I recieved a Steam key prior to this review.HighlightsThe variety of environments and pretty good intro level were enough to get me engaged, and the casual and unlimited nature of exploration from an early stage are worth mentioning. It's easy to skip ahead if you're impatient, but equally easy to spend an extra hour or two just exploring and grinding. There's also a variety of competent and occasionally funny dialogue from many different denizens in many different towns.The music is also very pleasant to listen to, and sets the tone really well without getting annoying at all.Overall, if the developer releases a patch or two and clears up some issues, this title will be worth picking up for what is essentially the price of a coffee.Mistakes and AnnoyancesI feel like a patch or two would fix up most of my complaints, but for the sake of completion and honesty here they are.There are tons of small technical bugs. I routinely found myself clipping through walls and into inaccessible areas, I was unable to equip or de-equip items after certain encounters, and had no way to continue but to slowly suicide, menu systems sometimes became disabled for unidentifiable reasons and plenty more small annoying technical mistakes that should've been play-tested and fixed.The support for using a mouse is great, and makes playing a lot faster and smoother, but the out of the box key bindings are frankly awful, and the in-game configuration panel isn't listed in the controls, nor accessible by anything other than messing around (it's F1 in all RPG Maker titles), and even that isn't properly labelled or actionable, and F12 causes crashes due to a bugged RPG Maker script. Again, these are little things that can be fixed fairly simply, but that's all the more reason to highlight them.There are design mistakes too, namely the save system relying on positional altar markers. This means that, like some of the older Zelda systems, you can only save before entering an area or after travelling to a specific place. For a game that encourages player grinding and a slow death screen, this makes little sense. An auto-save or simply just a save button would've been a far better choice.The main issue for me, however, was the combat. There is arguably a small level of skill required in coordinating where to position the player in regards to each enemy and the environment but, at least as the soldier class, it's mostly just about finding the next diagonal tile and slashing ad infinitum and became repetitive and bland after a short time and even boss fights are mostly about predicting the next move and getting in position.RecommendationsPriced at just £1.99/2.99€/$2.99 at the time of review, this is actually priced fairly, and will probably be worth picking up on sale for someone looking for a casual aaRPG with a nod towards older Nintendo titles, just not until some of the technical problems are corrected.

You have to use tab rather than use the mouse and its a pain when you are trying to map controls. I hope that will be fixed because it almost made me come close to asking for a refund.

												Early review:This game has so much potencial! It's an indie RPG game and I love RPGs!At the beginning you can choose between 2 characters: male or female. Then, you will chose your favorite role for your character. It has great character art style, it's like anime art style which is great for this game. The sound/music of this game is great to listen to. You can play either with M&K or controller. The negative aspects: limited resolution, some frame drops in certain areas, some grammar errors and the ""Game Over"" screen could be better arranjed than that. The Steam overlay isn't working, I couldn't chat with my friend and I can't minimize the game either. I also wanted more than 5 achievements and Steam cloud but this is optional of course.			"

												The novelty of Secret of Magia is in it's portable bridge which adds a puzzle component to many maps without the need of puzzles.  It's very beginner friendly, though it does seem a bit like it's commanding you to go this way or that initially.  For example, something like ""Go to your house.""  or ""Go to your house now."" could be better worded.  The class selection occurs after doing something else first.  The sections on each map don't flow together well, so they have that cookie cutter feel to them.  The gameplay is fun, which shows a lot of play testing.+gameplay+beginner friendly-wording choices-map sections don't seem to seemlessly mergeSince the script is probably the easiest thing to change in game updates, I think that's only a matter of the authors willingness to change it.  If the authors do that, then I think this game would only have one negative.			"

												The game reminds you immediately of Dink Smallwood.It does look extremely good as far as the character profiles go and the game art is intentinally 8 bit pixellatedI find these games 'tougher' to enjoy on a PC with 1080 resoution and would want them on my mobile. But that is my own opinion.The gameplay wokds on the 4 directional keys and attack/ moves using space and shifteasy 2 handed operationThe game features combat that is deceptively simple. You can die with lvl 1 monsters outside the village if you dont time attacksA better quest track sytem (with a map to start with) would be better. The maps you can see are too pixelated to make much sense of reading themGet this game if you like retro TOUGH classicsIf you dont, wait for the IOS/ Android/ WinX version "

												Okay, so Secret of Magia looks like your everyday normal RPG, but in face it plays more closely to the Gameboy Zelda games, well in my opinion anyway, it's fun, it's easy to get the hang of, it's hard (damn slimes always killing me) and it has secrets! (still can't find the icy-fire sword or whatever it's called) But yeah! I'd say it's worth it's $3 price tag!			"

The GoodThe atmosphere serves the game well.A decent soundtrack that is very fitting.The combat feels satisfying.The game runs smoothly.The BadSome of the most confusing controls I've ever experienced.Although the music is fitting, it is royalty free and you've likely heard it in 10+ games already.Steam overlay will leave a nasty white tear on the sides of your screen that will remain there until you close the game.For the first 20 minutes there is literally no story as far as I could tell. Pick a hero with a ball, a bird says go get the ""Four elements"", and that is it. You then have the games mechanics shoved down your throat in a frustrating tutorial.Low-end character portrait art.Some terrible game breaking bugs that the devs simply aren't acknowledging.In the first few minutes of the game I was already frustrated and unhappy. There was not a single bit of dialogue between characters in the beginning which makes it very hard for me to want to stick around. It's ok to have a learning curve but ony if the game at least seems appealing enough to learn it.The game itself is screaming copy cat. Hook shot is obtained in the first 5 minutes. What a surprise a RPGmaker element that I see in every RPGmaker game is in another RPGmaker game. ""Secret Of Magia"" sounds a whole lot like ""Secrets of Grindea"". The combat system although fun, has been used a number of times and doesn't bring anything new to the table. Even the inventory system has been used in at least 3 other RPGmaker games I've played. It's ok to use the engine but at least try to make it your own in the process.I can't recommend this game.Above all else... if I haven't yet deterred you yet... They have already announced ""Labyronia"" on Steam despite this game having just been released.Please don't support developers who crank out empty RPGmaker games every other month.			"

												Autumn 2015. Steam sale. Bundle of RPG Maker games for $2. 4 games, $0.50 each. I said sure, why not, how bad could it be? What is the Secret of Magia?It's a lie. It's a farce. It's a buggy, broken, terribly developed, messy piece of junk that should not be on Steam. Yet somehow it is. And if just playing the game wasn't enough, digging into these Steam reviews is even more eye-opening than one would think.When the dev himself is complaining about the publisher messing up his game, screwing it up, and even trying to hide that IT is the publisher (Epic Quest Games), you know something is foul.But if finding all those solid negative reviews and reading them isn't enough, have some more with this one.Action RPG? Yes, but only barely. Inspired by great games? Possibly, but this is so barebones and by the book that it hardly echoes of any of them mentioned on the Store page. Huge world? Nonsense. It's small enough to be easily beaten in less than 3 hours, AND you even have the in-game maps found to prove it. Tyranny of an evil, supernatural dictator? More like an ambiguous bird being who wakes you up and threatens your life if you don't gather plot items (as seen in one of the screenshots).I mean honestly the entire ""About This Game"" bit can be properly summarized down to ""Secret of Magia is an action RPG. Your story begins in a town. As you venture out, you'll earn levels and find obvious dungeons that have broken weapons. You start weak, you'll get strong, and you will never need to go back to your starting village. Explore a tiny world, grind aimlessly on cheap monsters, and go beat up the final boss.""4 side-quests of a moderately ambiguous nature. A really tiny overworld. Practically no plot whatsoever beyond ""go find the four things"". Flatter, more two dimensional characters than paper. Enemies that level with you, a battle system that is easily broken, weapon crafting and item drops that serve no real solid purpose. And a final boss who upon defeat compliments you then kicks you back to the title screen. That same final boss is the one who kick starts the plot to begin with, and that's basically all the plot you get.Secret of Magia is ONLY worth the cards it drops, and even then how much can you make? This is better off lost and forgotten about, tossed into the proverbial rubbish as it is now. Do not repeat my mistake.Because honestly, even fifty cents worth of candy gives more enjoyment than Secret of Magia.			"

												Secret of Magia looked like it was going to be a retro RPG, taking me back to the days of the Nintendo and Super Nintendo.  Playing Dragon Warrior, Faria, Times of Lore, or even Ultima to some extent. Starting out, you are in a room with Two characters, while you control a black sphere.  I was given the option choosing which Hero I wanted to play as by going through One of Two doors on either side of each Hero. I selected a character and was taken to a black screen where dialogue appeared. It seemed there was some sort of overarching villain who wanted ""the elements"" and threatened to reap your soul if you didn't get them for him. You then wake up in the bed of an inn, where you find a memo telling you to go to the bottom of a well to prove your worth. There was no tutorial playthrough where you learn how to open the menu, switch between various screens, equip items or gear, or to even orient you to your basic surroundings. I thought this was a little clumsy, because a lot of the good RPG games have these basic features. So it took a few moments to explore the keyboard to figure out how to open the menus and switching between things. Instead of my usual exploring I decided to follow the storyline and proceeded to a well where I descended and encountered rats. The game told me to equip a sword, but didn't explain how to do that: Luckily, I fooled around with the keyboard so I knew where to go and what to do. Rat-Kabob coming up. Then, I was told to equip a lantern, but for the life of me I couldn't find it in the inventory. Finally after 3 minutes of frustration I was able to locate a lantern, by going to my armor, selecting equip and there it was, hidden. Frustrated, I equipped it and proceeded through the cave slashing at rats.I think this game has some things going for it. Visually it is retro, but done in a good way. The story seems interesting, very Final Fantasyish; However, Ithink the dialogue is a little weak and the menu system is clunky. Perhaps playing further will alleviate my frustrations and I will be pleasantly surprised. For now though, based on my initial interaction with the game I think it is mediocre. Some things are done well, others not so well. It is playable and it is still an interesting RPG. I give it a thumbs up, but would urge caution for those who are easily frustrated or have unrealistic expectations.			"

												Secret of magia is and action RPG, and it has some really weird stuff:- The equipment system that isn't explained, and you basically need to purchase every single weapon to check if your class can equip it;- The guard feature that works if you have equipped any kind of shield, but lacks of any graphical animation, basically you just sit there and ask yourself whether you are actually guarding or not, and hope for the best;- The enemies get stronger as your character level up, and even the starting slimes end up almost 1-hit-killing you;- The knockback that makes you switch areas just as you enter a new map and some monters attack you;- The knockback that gets you stuck in between a monster and it's own attacks;- The knockback;- The doors that have weird hitzones and are sometime placed wrong (for example: doors on the left side that teleport you on a sofa in a room called ""the right wing"" (?));- Visual glitches, a lot of them, you can walk on walls in many rooms, windows are placed wrong on the walls, roofs have very unusual shapes (i wanted to take a screenshot to show that, but pressing f12 quits the game, btw);- Letters that morph into flowers (there is a letter in the first village, and as you try to read it, it switch to a flower, and gets back to a paper sheet as you quit reading it);- Lack of explanations about the mechanics (it took me some time to figure out how to use the shovel, and i still don't understand what's the point of the lantern and how to use it);- The story basically doesn't exist, you just start an adventure not knowing what you are doing and why, it just tells you something about some elements you should find;- Textures in general, they are glitchy and buggy when you get in front of some objects;- You can't alt-tab during the game, you are just stuck in fullscreen;At the end, i mjust say that the game isn't really ""bad"", but it needs A LOT of beta testing and bug fixing, and a plot, too.------------------------------------I had some great time bugging myself into the church and ""ascending"" through the walls btw.Ascension Simulator 2015			"

												Riddle of Magia is an autonomous redirection made by Lunatoid using the RPG Maker VX Expert engine. Both the delight and the engine are open for purchase on Steam. Reminiscent of the early Zelda and Last Dream titles, Riddle of Magia will take you on a hazardous top-down big business through grounds of changed region. By get-together stock and interesting limits, you will probably return 4 unprecedented articles to a noteworthy supervisor and procure 5 thousand Steam achievements. Unfortunately, as of this composed work, none of the achievements are truly popping... in a perfect world this will be settled soon. The primary demand of business when starting another preoccupation is to pick one of two characters: male or female. Disregarding the way that you have a spiffy mouse cursor alive and well of a sword, you can't use it here. With your jolt keys, coordinate a dull hover through the gateway by the character of choice (I picked male for this review). A little while later you will pick one of 6 character-classes (I picked Paladin) and get side voyages to supplement the major story line. As your experience continues with, you'll keep running over towns and distinctive spots noteworthy to your target of social affair the 4 remarkable things for the immense manager. We should talk towns. As indicated by RPG measures, these settlements contain three staples of adventuring: markers, structures and non-player characters (NPCs). Markers can be anything from a stone to garbage dumpster... basically, a stationary thing of interest. In Secret of Magia, an unmistakable town marker is the ""Extra Entertainment"" wellspring. Structures give an organization, whether it be weaponry, sustenance or essentially a place to rest. Lunatoid was adequately wise to join a specialist's office sort working, for smart patching in the wake of a dull day of getting yourself hurt. NPCs are the most intriguing of the town staples, as they offer bits of data to help you impel the story. As a less than dependable rule their help is quick; at various times cloud. Regardless, they're persistently charming to meet. The open world is colossal, and you'll as often as possible go over alarming areas. Say what you will, yet the commendable RPG ""cell"" has constantly been my most adored spot to experience anything; especially fight. Enemies are definitely not hard to spot in this redirection. They meander impulsively about... until they get inside a couple hex spaces of you. Do whatever it takes not to get vain, in any case. Rather than using a turn-based structure, Riddle of Magia offers consistent fight. Adversaries can unexpectedly shoot toward you, hit you for mischief and pull back to prosperity, all in a minute. I suspected that it was useful to take cover behind near to things and a short time later surge the baddies before they could get a ricochet on me... however, those were just sewer rats. Mindful foes are much harder! Despite a standard weapon, your character ought to in like manner juggle a shield, defensive layer and a substantial gathering of phenomenal embellishments and spells. This redirection puts RPG Maker through its paces, and it's up to the player to make everything work. The best direction I can give for the youngster is: ""Take as much time as essential!"" The entertainment sports get ready grounds and fight shams on which explorers can hone their capacities. Before long, I'd contribute equal the initial investment with vitality getting awesome with the swarm menus and sub-menus; trading things and weapons on demand: ESC/Enter/Space/Q/Move/X... like a comfort ninja (which is one of the classes you can pick, incidentally)! I found the menu structure exceptionally bewildering at to begin with, however with some practice I got the hang of it. Clearly we're not part particles here, but instead I'd considerately suggest that menus be fairly more regular. This passes on us to our last point: delight regard. Is Puzzle of Magia defended, in spite of all the inconvenience? The reaction for me is a stunning YES. As of this conveyance, the preoccupation is at a can anticipate $1.79 (US). Before adequately long the cost will shoot go down to 3 bucks... to ensure you know. I've by and large been a lover of RPGs, cell crawls et cetera. Since the RPG Maker VX Master engine is available to all, want to see some of these surprising endeavors soon. Who knows, possibly you could be the accompanying phenomenal RPG maker! In the interim, play around with this one. (All reviews are recuperated from the Internet and channeled through a movement of equal word devices three times both for intelligence and to extra time. In my religion, this is known as Art(TM), in any case you can call it ""Threewording"") "

												Secret of Magia is an ARPG made in RPGmaker. It is not like other RPGmaker game, as it is not turn-based... It's more of an action game.The pathing of monsters and their attacks are quite frustating to play against, some just dash to you in zigzag kinda patterns and are almost impossible to dodge. On the other hand, with anything but a dagger or a bow, you can sit next to monsters and kill them to your side. With a bow, you can just kill them from afar without them trying to kill you.It could have been a great game, but there are too many flaws. Mana regen is slow, leveling-up actually makes the monsters harder to kill overall. Classes are a little meaningless and have no really specific skills. There's also no abilities to unlock as you gain levels.There's no maps, so you have to keep the layout of the map in your head and the game is just pretty, bland... In the first 2 dungeons anyways, all you have to do is kill the unique monster inside the zone, get his key and then unlock the door that leads to the boss room, that's not very original!The music is not too bad, but I heard it wasn't composed for this game, so I won't praise it too much. The graphics are fair enough for RPGmaker, but they could be way better. There are some game breaking bugs (just pressing f12 for example, it crashes your game). The game is also very short.The game is really cheap, about $1, but even there, it's not a game I would really recommend playing. If you are a fan of RPGmaker games, then maybe this is for you, otherwise, I did not enjoy it very much, it is a bit too clunky and unfun to play.			"

												Let's make a very quick review of this game... It looks like just a project to test some cool systems (scripts) from RPG Maker, like Quests and Crafting.The creator tried... But I don't think he even bothered to check for bugs, level progression, or whatever.Mapping is meh... Just the usual maps everyone could make. But with bugs, like you can pass through the walls, or teleporting to wrong locations...Battle system. Just ok. Fast, but that's it, not even fun to keep beating those monsters.About the music... Yeah, it's nice, I guess that's the good thing the game has.And that's it. There are better FREE games out there on RPG Maker community for you to play, the genre you choose. I hope the creator can get deep on game devolopment, it isn't just about ""making a generic RPG, with cool scripts to make it nice, and put it there to people download.""			"

												Horrible. Just horrible. No clear goals, bad battle mechanics, no info or tips on how to use magic/craft/skills/etc, buggy (you can walk into ""space"" in one of the mine tunnels), and just very aimless in general. Even loses out to lots of free RPGs out there.			"

												After playing ""Secret of Magia"" for over 10 hours I must say that it has its good moments and unfortunately lots of bad moments as well.Let's start with the pros:-I like the fighting system, since it makes the gameplay more arcade-ish compared to the turn based RPGs.-It has a male and female character selection, classes, armors, weapons, gathering, alchemy, blacksmithing, trading and    even gambling!-The hookshot is a nice plus!-The quest system is great as well!-The graphics are cute, especially the character close ups.-Audio-wise it has a decent soundtrack that fits perfectly to the game's concept.So what's bad after all?-A couple of bugs to ruin your gaming experience... For example: http://steamcommunity.com/app/396160/discussions/0/521643320363085829/-The enemies are leveling up according to your level! That alone actually destroys the point of leveling... -Your character's speed gives you the impression that everything goes in fast forward. -You are basically on your own. You do not get a lot of help from the game, in order to progress.-I found myself spending most of the time wandering around the areas in order to find out what's next. Although, there's an in game map in certain places, that doesn't help so much. I would rather have it accessible everywhere in the game after pressing the M key.-There's a quest where you get the following coordinates ""X33 Y24"", but there's not any coordinate indication in the game to get an idea where you have to go.-You cannot save the game anytime and anywhere you want.-I wasn't able to switch into windowed mode until I found out in the game's discussions that you have to press the F5 key to do so. Also, Alt + tab doesn't work.-Minor spelling issues.-Lazy ending...Overall it has a lot of potential to become a great game and I would love to see improvements and bug fixes as soon as possible! Until then I cannot recommend it.My rating: 4 Ts out of 10. |TTTT......			"

+ Fighting works ok + Music + Price - Story is a joke- Lack of content- Insignificant character progressionI don't usually play jrpg games on my PC - but I got this free so I gave it a try. I've played some popular jrpg titles like Golden Sun -series and first Zelda games and this game has elements form both of them.The start of the game is fuzzy - Firstly player picks a character between male and female and then a short cutscene is shown where some gigantic bird looking creature tells protogonist to find and bring 4 elements or else to be eliminated. After this threat hero wakes from nightmare and that's pretty much it there is to be told of character's backgrounds in the game. What's even worse that I've already revealed the first half of the main plot. So avoid this game if you play games to enjoy story telling.The fighting system works decently though. Battles are fought in real time and assaulting at enemy head over heels is not an option. There is various monster types and this difference isn't limited how they look, but also how they attack. During fights it's possible to move, block, attack, use spell. It's a shame though that there is not much to look for on these hostile areas. The loot which drops from monsters is money, sometimes materials, but never anything more special you can find in stores in villages. Now the roaming on large world seems pointless because there is not much in there when monsters are excluded.Another annoying fact is that the character progression is actually a lie. This is about the correlation between the levels of your character and the enemies. So wheter your level was 1 or trillion, the difficulty stays unchanged that actually ruins the enjoyment there is left.I could complain forever, but still - with all its weaknesses The Secret of Magia is not a total bummer. It has priced itself modestly and some features work but it is the competition which makes it look bad. There is numerous respected JRPGs developed with RPG maker in steam. They might be more expensive but do have much much more content and quality than this game.			"

												Disclosure: Recieved review copy. To put things shortly this game is a awesome action game - But it is plagued by lack of polish and bugs. Needs more love from the devs before i can recommend this. Pro:+ Player gets quite quickly into action. + Action is realtime and the system works+ Lots of drops and not that much xp grinding in the beginning+ Linear combat. Once you learn to not go head first into enemies the combat side start to shine. It is surprisingly satisfying to clear a big area and make it out from there without taking a hit. Conversely one dumb mistake or sloppy  attitude when initiating combat means the first slime that you encounter machine gun spits you to death. Combat generally is such that both player and enemies attempt to pass around each other and get into position to strike. Player is outnumbered but generally has the advantage of wide arching strike that is mandatory to survive even the first monsters.Con: - Glitches. Player passes trough walls here and there. Combine this with the fact that player character moves really fast. It is sometimes hard to not run into things. - You attack button is also the action button for digging/picking items. So you walk around hitting things all the time. I dont want to see a 'Do you want to pick flowers?' prompt when i am attempting to outflank a enemy.  - Lots of empty space in safe areas. Why is the starting village so HUGE ?  - Spelling and wording here and there. Game feels rushed. Finishing touches are missing. I am happy to change this to positive should the game receive more polish.  Almost there but not quite. I sure hope this game gets to see some more love in form of updates as i really like the game idea and i can easily recommend this should the game experience be more fluid. Now i'd say wait before buying or buying on deep discount only.			"

												Just finished it, and well, it's not really worth the $1. The combat is really basic and tile based, and the dungeons are super simple (defeat midboss to get key, go to boss). Also never have i seen a game that punishes you for levelling. The game autolevels the monsters as you level up (like skyrim for example). But there hardly is any new equipment. So thanks to that the monsters just get stronger and stronger and you feel weaker with every levelup.The game probably also has the stupidest, laziest ending i've ever seen. But there might be multiple endings, i dunno.			"

												I'll end up updating my review as I play but so far I like it. It's nothing out of this world or revolutionary. But for what it is, what it's made on, and the fun im getting out of it is pretty good. If you've got a couple extra bucks you could give it a try for sure if you're into old rpgs like on the snes and what not.Pros-It has a very oldtimey feel to it like on the snes. Kinda like Secret of Mana but with Link to the Past's camera angle.Farming Money isnt hard at all (Could be a pro or con)Combat doesnt feel slowCons-Very selective animations due to the lack of resources I assume, which isnt a huge problem but you're weapon slashes resemble old gen pokemon attacks. (To put it into respective)Combat can feel repetitive, but still fun (Very similar to secret of mana)----------------------------So in all honesty, this game is fun. (For what it is) I dont have much to say yet but my best reccomandation is to buy this if you love either the snes, nes, or any rpg maker games. It's fun			"

												It's a quickly-played, quickly-made RPG Maker action RPG game.  RPG Maker notoriously handles anything but the turn-based actions it was made to handle quite poorly, so the game can be clunky at times, but it's not QUITE as bad as most action RPGs on RPG maker is.  Still, I would suggest looking to something made in another engine for any substansive action RPG fix, because this game is anemic in content, and has no interesting gimmicks to make it stand out compared to the hundred other Zelda-wannabes on Steam.Pros:* Dirt cheap, so you won't regret it long even if you don't like it.* It's fairly fast-paced, and you level up quickly with relatively little grinding. * It's possible to just run past most of the enemies.* Six possible classes.* If you aren't going for cards, you can beat the game fast enough to return it for a refund!Cons: * The enemies are rubber-banded to your level, while your stat-boosting equipment is based upon how far in the plot you have progressed, meaning you lose power relative to your enemies as you gain levels.* The enemies meander around until it's time for their attack, at which point they fly at you at mach 12, clip through your own attacks, and keep chasing you even if you do hit them in the middle of their attack.  * You have a shield button, but except for the archer, you have to be a melee class to get it, and there's no wind-up animation to warn you to raise your shield before they start running at you, so you need to use psychic precognition to tell when to use your shield when you're standing only 1-2 tiles away.* The enemies deal about 1/5 your total health per hit.* The enemies have about second-long invulnerability after being hit, and can attack immediately after that.* The enemies can stun-lock you in place with spammed ranged attacks * The classes are not described in-game at all, and have unintuitive effects.* The classes are not balanced at all.* The archer class relies upon arrows, can only carry 99 at a time, I shot 50 getting from the first town to the second, and the second town doesn't have arrow vendors.  * The spells deal 1/6th the damage a physical attack does no matter what your magic stat is, so mages are useless.* All other classes are melee classes, and any melee class besides Paladin is just plain weaker than the Paladin.  * Bugs galore! Walk through walls! Don't walk through objects that look the same as ones you can walk through! Enter one house, leave out a different one!* The writing is as utterly barebones as possible.  ""Go kill this thing for me."" ""Thank you for killing it.  Here's the ___ I promised."" * The plot consists of your character having a dream where a bird tells you to go kill four bosses and bring it their souls or it'll eat your soul.  You find these bosses literally just sitting out in a field, and after you're done killing all four, you get a final boss, then, BAM, credits, game over.  * You will finish in about an hour if you don't grind, and the game punishes you for grinding, anyway.

												From the description of the game, Secret of Magia seemed like something I might enjoy. I loved the Legend of Zeldas, Mana series, and Arc The Lad... unfortunately this game has very little in common with any of them other than a sprawling map that's devoid of content but full of enemies.The only good I can really say about the game is that it gives you a choice between a male or female protagonist, and that the combat system is hack'n'slash versus the regular turn-based that comes with most RPGMs.Otherwise, Secret of Magia feels very much unfinished. As others have pointed out, there are plenty of graphical and boundary issues, the writing for NPCs is very unnatural, and you're not given any real directions to go on for your quest.			"

												It's a fun game, although I agree with previous reviewers about the absolute garbage controls, you'll find yourself mashing the left side of your keyboard if you play a class that uses magic.  The main reason for my negative review though is the fact that it has numerous game breaking glitches.  Pretty much, if you aren't prepared to fight a boss and are stupid enough to save right outside the Boss room, you get locked out permanantly if you leave.  Don't buy this game, for any price, Game developers don't deserve a single penny if they can't be bothered to release a game that breaks and punishes players for trusting save points.			"

												There is almost no story, no direction on where to go, enemies level up with you making your really good gear obsolete, & when attacking  after you level up your enemies take less damage than if you were a lower level and have crappy gear. And finally the worst of all insane amounts of button mashing, so much in fact your hand feels like it might fall off.

												The enemies level with you. It wouldn't be so bad if there was a way to get weapons BEFORE going to the third town.Sure, there's a 'hidden' weapon on the way, but you have to kill a difficult enemy to obtain it...which gets stronger as you level up.Not a well crafted or written game. In the state it is in I can't recommend it. Super easy to just power through the achievements, however. Just follow the guide already written for them, and you can get them without having to attack a single enemy.An auto-save feature would help a LOT for the type of difficulty curve with this game as well.

												I would really like to say that I loved this game, but I did not.Very retro RPG game, liked the environment and the music.I admit that I only played for about 40 minutes but that was enough. The biggest issue for me was the fact that monsters level up when I do. So basically the right way to play is to avoid all monsters and that is no way for me to play. I also hated the combat system. If these don't bother you you might like it.But for me, there is just so many good games in the world that I'm not going to use any more minutes to this game.			"

												Despite being a VERY generic RPG game, it has a few pros.Pros+ Very comforting music+ There are boss battles which many of these types of games just don't have+ Achievements take about 15 minutes to get them all so its a nice bump to an overall      completion percentage + Visuals aren't total crap so that's a plus right?Cons- No really storyline to follow. It more or less just plops you down in the middle of the game with barely an inkling of the controls, or anything else for that matter.- No actually settings. You can't switch around the keyboard to fit your playstyle which is extremly annoying. There are also several different keys for each action which can be helpful and confusing at the same time.- The combat is a joke. Get a melee weapon and stand diagonal to any enemy and you can kill it without ever getting injured. Albeit, some bosses have attacks that follow you around, but that is about it.This review kinda makes it out like I hated the game, but it was kinda fun dodging every enemy to get all the achievements so I'll give it a recommended.

Also, the enemies get stronger and stronger as you level up so there really is no point in leveling other than it will take longer to kill every 'bad guy'. I believe there is a crafting system in the game as you can get resources and parts as drops but i haven't come accross anything in the amount that i played. All in all, its a great effort to make a real time stratergy game that is done in an old rpg format which makes it creditable, i just wish the game didn't have a leveling system that makes it harder as you kill more or procs that will make it impossible to live.

												If you enjoy the Secret of Mana, then you may enjoy this game.  The combat is fairly easy, but unforgiving.  That may sound strange, but it basically depends on how good you are at avoiding getting stun locked by enemies.  At the beginning I got shot multiple times by one enemy and died instantly, but after figuring out what I needed to do, combat was easy.I'm honestly not sure what the plot is, other than what I read on the game's steam page.  I got tired of playing after defeating a dragon and then having a new enemy spawn directly on top of me and kill me.  Perhaps the story starts to make sense, but I really couldn't say.But, the price is right for what you get.			"

The biggest flaw, if you leave a dungeon while at the final boss without killing the boss you CANNOT reenter to finish him off you have to reload a save spot. I think I was like 15 and finished the game. There are only 2 places to buy weapons in the game and one place to upgrade them otherwise you get weapons when killing the elements (the 4 bosses of the game) I bought it super cheap so I guess you get what you pay for.

												it's not bad, but very bland.  it's a zelda-like game built in RPGMaker.  I had 2 major problems with the game:1) it may have been my chosen class (paladin), but enemies scaled with my level, and their HP scaled much faster than my damage, so after an hour of playing, the enemies outside the start town were taking 6, 8, or even 10 blows to kill.  This was not fun, since the combat system as I could figure it was to get at an angle where you could hit the enemy, but he couldn't hit you and then whack him until he died.2) the whole system isn't responsive enough, and everything moves so quickly, that it feels like dodging during important fights is pretty impossible, so instead my startegy quickly devolved into ""drink potions until the boss dies""I have other problems, like bad tutorial, lack of explanation on classes, bad questing system, poorly designed crafting system, poorly scaled crafting mats, needlessly large empty town areas, etc			"

But if you are not a crafter of badges....No, Just no!  Save your money unless this game is is less the cost of 3 of its cards!One of the better in-depth reviews I read for this game - google (web search) - Gamers Elite UK+Secret of Magia - it will break everything down perfectly.Now onto my own review:Game can be speedrun via youtube in under 20 mins.The only thing saving this game is the battle system, and tons of other games are worth playing or getting your money in regards to that.There is no story, like even for RPG standards, gather the 4 elements to beat end-game boss, cliche and unimaginative.  Even this dialogue about that fast....no content.There are side quests, but its a waste of time, many items are just there, only to never be used again, even in quests, just lackluster all around design.Just about every item in the game are in beginning towns, then never seen again, you will literally have to backtrack to revisit for potions or weapons if you spent hours exploring all this game had to offer, and 20 minutes was enough for me aside from idling for card drops.""Sleep at the Inn Game Achievement"" - several inns are borderline glitched or broken and unuseable....have to find the right one to even get this silly achievementDefeat End Game Boss - almost instant Fade to Black - Load Start Game ending WTF?!?!?It is just too simplisitic, feels incomplete, incoherent, and just really lackluster.  Idle for cards and pray you profit because I doubt anyone would want to touch this again.  Save your life and money.  If you do decide to get it, speedrun it, sell cards.

												I grabbed this game because it looked very similar to Eternal Senia, and I enjoyed it for the same reasons: it's a cheap, humorously bad game that relies entirely on its charm (whether or not it's supposed to). If you don't mind shelling out a couple bucks for a few hours of ridiculously easy gameplay and no plot whatsoever, you can probably find something worth playing in this game; otherwise, you might be better off avoiding it.

												Not really worth reviewing, it's not really a game. Looks like a 5 minute whip-together on RPG maker, it probably is. Highly recommend not to try this at all, spend time and money on something else. Good for 100% achievements, though. Except you can get all achievements so quickly that you wont have collected all the trading cards so you have to run around in circles or leave it running.			"

												JRPG clearly made from RPG Maker. There's not a lot of pros to this game other than the fact that you get a perfect completion in less than half an hour by running around avoiding enemies which is SUPER easy. I spent 2 hours trying to find a way to like the game.Pros:+Easy Trading Cards+Easy Achievements+Easy Perfect GameCons:-No Uniqueness to NPC's other than the portrait which is probably imported within RPGMaker-No Direction, you're left to find your own path and own quests in the game-The Text and Dialogue are very amateur in it's story telling and doesn't immerse you into the game-Playstyle is rigid and boring-Enemies scale with your level and gear, making every monster encounter the same, just changing pixels-Tedious and repetitive-Poor Controls don't mesh well with the game2/10 For trying			"

The Secret of Magia dares you to play it, comparing it to RPG greats such as the Legend of Zelda and Secret of Mana.Do you have what it takes to delve into this story's mysteries?Are YOU ready for ADVENTURE?!? Are you looking for fun?Then look somewhere else.Concept & Story:Secret of Magia is standard Japanese Role-Playing-Game fare. There is nothing new brought to the table. Some may be fine with this approach, as was I. However, there is hardly any story at all. The game opens with a monstrous bird that threatens to kill you if you do not return with four crystals... at least it appears to threaten you. Significant grammatical errors are made immediately. While these can be sludged though and understood because of context, they persist throughout the game, sometimes making sentences nonsensical. This problem never alleviates. There are portions of text that lead completely off the screen, leaving the player to guess what was being said. After leaving the introduction, our hero is set on a set of sidequests. That's it: five sidequests that aren't really tied in any way to the plot. The plot, of course, does not exist. It is only revisited at the end of the game and very, very briefly at that. While it is typically considered in bad taste to spoil the ending of a game or film, I cannot do so, though I am sorely tempted to. You see, the ending... it doesn't exist. As the boss lays dying, you are returned to the title screen. No credits, no ""Thank you for playing"", not even ""Game Over""; there is absolutely nothing following this. This isn't just unexpected in story-based games, it's just downright rude.Concept & Story - 2/10Gameplay:This sort of title has many expected mechanics in gameplay style. It is clear what the developer was aiming for, it just misses the mark in each and every way. Full controller support is claimed, but this is false. Movement, with a control pad, is only permitted with the analog stick, not the directional pad. This sort of game would have played much better with the latter. Giving players the option of either or best would work for everyone. Instead, the developer chose otherwise. The buttons used for play are odd in placement and incredibly awkward throughout the game. It is not unusual for them to be nonresponsive. Sometimes, there is a significant delay between pressing buttons and having a chosen action take place. This is inexcusable.Navigating menus is slow, tedious, and excessive. Early in the game, the player is asked to equip items that aren't even present. They come into existence only when suggested by the interface. Other portions of inventory are completely unused, specifcally charms and accessories. It is as if something were planned and then completely forgotten. Evidently, the forgetfullness persisted through alpha and beta testing, if there was any at all.The game utilizes class systems, levels, and crafting. This would seem a good idea. Class choice makes little difference as they play nearly the same. When leveling, your character becomes stronger. Unfortunately, the enemies gain in strength, health, and resistances to your attacks... and very disproportionally so. In other words, ""leveling up"" not only does not help you, it is an extremely bad idea. Under no conditions should the player consider grinding for experience; they may find the game unfinishable. Crafting is introduced to upgrade weapons and to create potions. In fact, one entire town in the game is dedicated to the industry of alchemy and potions. This system is never flushed out and developed. It suggests itself to have great promise and then proceeds to be completely ignored. There is no reason to bother with crafting weapons of any sort.There are more concerns about things that would never be discussed if it were not for the fact that these normal mechanics are broken. Sleeping in village inns poses the slight risk of waking up in another town. It would appear that the screens that the interiors of the Inns are not reliably linked to the screens of the towns. As such, about one out of three nights spent will leave you across the world. When fighting certain enemies, the player can be stunned. This, in it of itself, is normally not an issue, but menu access is also locked. Any attempts to access the Game Menu or otherwise Pause are also ""stunned"". The entire game locks until the Effect wears off. There is no reason for this. Frequently, the player will become stunned even if not hit with a stunning attack. There is no way to predict when this will happen. Furthermore, progress through the four key dungeons is dependend on acquiring unique keys held be mini-bosses. Sometimes they drop them upon death... sometimes they don't. If not, pray you did not save, as the required Key is now and forever inaccessible. The only solution is to reset or load from a previous save file and try again.For what should be simple and casual play and control, The Secret of Magia fails even at this minimal task.Gameplay - 3/10Sound & Music:The sounds are fine and what would be expected for this sort of game. While voice-acting is a nice feature, it is not neccessary. Music is acceptable. It isn't awful, but it isn't memorable either. It is the sort of thing one would expect if a developer snatched up a few royalty-free music tracks and tossed in the ones that sounded best. Actually, this is exactly what developer, Lunatiod, did. The exact same music can be heard in other games as well. Even if they chose to use synthesised MIDI tracks that someone composed with this title in mind, it could have added more substance. Sound & Music - 5/10Graphics:JRPGs have a typical look to them and this title attempts to keep up with the look and style of these. It is light and whimsical, with a touch of cartoony adventure. This being said, it is expected that things are consistent. Windows appear out of the edges of the walls of a church. Players walk right over gates. The player can even walk into and through some walls. Frequently when moving, the player will appear to be using their ""Hookshot"" item, when no such device is in use. These realatively easy fixes persist.Most striking is the fact that the game does not appear as shown in the presented screenshots and advertisment video. It is extremely clear that the developer or publisher used photo and/or video editing software to make the game appear to have a very different asthetic than is actually present. In short, this is false advertising. This sort of practice is loathesome and completely disqualifies this aspect of the game.Graphics - 0/10Enjoyability and Replay Value:Secret of Magia showed a certain amount of promise. Each promise suggested was carelessly broken. Even if one sets their expectations low, this particular title fails to meet even that. This was an attempt to be a game without any intention to put in effort. It is hours of constant frustration dealing with glitches and broken game mechanics, a lack of story. and a complete absense of any fun. They entire game plays out as if ""fun"" is going to be right around the corner; it never comes.Since all characters are virtually the same, despite what their names suggest, there isn't a reason to try these variations out. There is not much in the way of secrets, so outside of a hidden dagger (with coordinates that mean nothing), there is nothing to go back for. It isn't even the sort of game that one can enjoy the story once more, because there is practically no story and what little is presented is certainly not enjoyable. It isn't fun or remotely interesting. It offers absolutely nothing.Enjoyability and Replay Value - 2/10Final Thoughts:It is obvious that the publisher and developer were interested in creating something that could be called a game, on paper. At 49 cents for this and three other titles, I feel ripped off. A waste of two hours. Avoid.Overall - 2/10			"

												PROS+For one brief moment, I truly felt like a child again, playing the Secret of [Blank] games+Somewhat fast-paced+Nice old-school setup (4 dungeons, towns scattered about, etc)+Enemy graphics (what few there are) feel somewhat nice to look at.CONS-Holy crap, where to start-Bugs everywhere-Sloppy Design-No balancing-No fight mechanic other than mash attack and chug potions-No real story-Classes do not matter-Spells do not matter-Equipment does not matter-Quests do not matter-You don't want to level up (it just makes enemies stronger, but since your equipment doesn't scale up with level, you actually become weaker)-Level design is laughably absent-Environment design lacks asthetics (Why are the church windows morphing into the side of the building? Why do doors open up into a doorway that is smaller than the door? Why can't I walk behind a 5-story tall tower?)-No real meaningful choices in the game-No real dialogue between any characters-Townsfolk are boring and uninspired-No treasure to be found in Dungeons--or really anywhere else for that matter-Crafting system is pointless-Alchemy system is pointless-Don't choose mage like I did--there are only 2 spells in the game and they are pointless-Some boss weapon drops are pointless-Quests do not give you any meaningful rewards-Some parts of the world feel largely unfinished (why are there guard towers with instructions on how to light warning  signals? We never use them. Why is there a farmer out in the middle of nowhere? He does nothing important)-Ultimately just feels empty, sort of like my soul when I finished thisSecret of Magia stands to deliver what we of the 80's generation long to grasp once again--the joys of our old-school SNES RPG youth. What starts out as something that feels like it might come close quickly drops into a sloppy lazy unfinished flop of a game. It's not worth your time--you'd be better off just playing the real Secret of [Blank] games than trying out this game.			"

												There are some very annoying issues with this game that prevent me being able to recommend it. The game has potential, so it's sad that I really can't recommend it. Some of the issues: Dev hasn't fixed simple bugs that force you to restart - in the mines (the first dungeon) there's an enemy that drops a ""fire key"". If you use the key and then leave, the door is locked when you come back. The enemy will still drop the key, but it won't show up in your inventory or allow you to unlock the door again. Until this gets fixed I have to assume that the dev has abandoned this game. The leveling system is pointless - enemies get stronger when you level up. In fact, they get stronger faster than you do, so leveling is actually counterproductive. Enemies are overpowered - enemies right outside the first town can kill you with only a couple hits, and thanks to the backwardness of the leveling system there is no way to overcome that through gaining levels. Few enemies telegraph their attacks - not only do enemies hit hard, but there are only a few enemies for which you can actually tell that they are about to attack and dodge. Stun + no temporary immunity = 1-hit KO - when you get hit, you are stunned for a little while. The moment you can move again, you are vulnerable. This means that enemies that attack multiple times in a row can (and usually will) hit you multiple times. This leads to you being stuck, watching your character get hit over and over until they die without you being able to do anything about it (other than burning through healing items until the enemy stops attacking).The combat system really could be fun, but there's no room for skill. You can't see when an enemy is going to attack you, so you can't dodge except by attacking from a location that the enemy can't hit (and not all enemies have such a location). As you gain levels it takes longer and longer to kill even the starting enemies, which gets tedious very quickly. In short, combat seems very unbalanced and the game suffers significantly because of it.			"

												totally forgetable ""RPG"" made by RPG maker, don't expect much from this game.In the description they call it ""heavily inspired by The Legend of Zelda: A Link To The Past, Arc The Lad, and Secret of Mana."" if by inspired they mean has a UI then yes.This game seems like it was a work in progress that got pushed before completion for small time money grab, plus trading card revenue. The game it self is inconsistant, gold as seen in the UI is also called f from creature drops, and fulions(sp didn't care enoguth to launch the game again to find out) in shops and crafting.Crafting is aweful, bring a bunch of crap all taht can be store bought and wait while the bar fills, and you need to skill up to get sucessful completions so lots of wasted time staring at a crafting interface.combat is laughable with creatures not hitting you if you stand to the diagnal of them, oh and don't forget creature scaling, so by the time you've hit your 2nd town the 2 creature you fought now takes 3-5 hits where as it iwas one shot able when you left.Class system... nothing like going to the 30 second 'starter dungeon' then some guy coems to you house and says hey what do you want to be, no description or reall differance between most classes from what i could tell.

												I didn't have any prior knowledge to what this game was about before playing. While I love the effort put into RPG Maker for these sorts of games, unfortunately I just don't feel like I can recommend this one.It feels unfinished, like this was a build to get things balanced before the story was fully written, and unfortunately the balancing just didn't happen either. As others have said, the enemies level up with you, which would have been fine if the shops did too, but once you have the basic equipment you run out of things to spend money on other than health potions, of which you will be using a lot because the armor is quickly outpaced by the damage of enemies. Your own damage does comparatively less as you level, and enemies take longer to kill the more you play, until it takes a minute to bring down a basic enemy by knocking them back into a wall to stun-lock them in place.The achievements are simple and easy to get, and the game elements like harvesting flowers as impromptu potion materials can be quite charming, but ultimately the game fell flat on the one thing most important to gaming. It just wasn't that fun. I didn't have to finish it to get the achievements, and unless I have a pretty dull day at work on this dusty laptop, I probably won't ever see where the story was heading. It was just too lacking to keep me invested.			"

												Is there a new genre in the gaming world that I'm not aware of? Speed-runners, super casual, less than an hour long RPG genre? Seriously, this RPG is less than an hour long! I know, I know ""It was only $1.99! Cool your jets."", but the shortness of the game isn't the only problem. Let's go into the pros and cons, shall we?Pros:- Fun action RPG... from what little you get. (Think of Terranigma (SNES) or Secret of Mana (SNES))- Somewhat difficult (If you decide to charge at a slime, or even a lowly bee, they just might kill you. They are that powerful!)- Actually has decent crafting for such a low-cost gameCons:- Obvious bugs and glitches (You're able to walk on walls and bookcases. How bizarre.)- Feels like it's still in alpha stages; a money grab- A quickly put together story that your average third grader would come up with- Game falls apart the more you advance: less story, less side-quests, less crafting, ect...If you want a game where you can get achievements and cards easily, sure pick this game up when it's on sale (or better yet in a bundle!). If you're looking to delve into a classic ARPG, then DON'T bother with this game. "

												This game is an interesting concept. I'm not so sure on the execution, though. After a short intro ""mission"" of sorts, you gain the ability to use weapons (larger than a knife, anyway) and get a class. These classes only differ on weapons and armor available, at least at the point I have reached. Since, you basically run around slashing the air in front of you to kill mobs and earn coins.Still, there seems to be a glimmer of something good within it.			"

												This game feels like it's trying to do the Y Chronicals or Link to the Past thing, where combat takes place in real time, rather than in the typical random enounter way. The problem with this is that the RPG Maker engine wasn't meant for this type of combat. Developers, I congratulate you for making the game do it... but it's a shame you didn't do it well.I learned that this game uses a system where enemiew level up with the player. A novel concept, but it utterly fails in practice. Developers, I'm sorry. But you picked the wrong genre to include such a feature, because doing this punishes the player for grinding. When you have a game that rewards players for killing enemies with exp, money, and crafting items, chances are we're going to be encouraged to fight as many things as we can see. And the combat system you developed makes it really easy to kill a ton of things early on. But as you level up, enemies will start to take more and more hits to kill. And then you'll reach level 5 during the first notable quest, only to get gored by a bee on the way back.Killing 20 slimes doesn't turn the rest of them into liquid iron. Not in a logical world, anyways.Writing is extremely poor early on. Who am I? Why do I down a rat infested well to train? What ""training"" do I get done by beating up on an archery target with a knife? How did guy from the guild see me training on the cliff side? I never say any other spot in town where someone could get that kind of view. The moment I'm done with that training, he comes to me and says he'll give me a weapons license and a guild membership. Is it really that easy to join this guild? I wouldn't mind if the writing wasn't handled so clumsily. If you have a guild with criteria to join, it's typically best to have the player go to the guild, and be given some sort of minor adventuring quest to join it. Not saying you have to fit the generic mold; but either make joining the adventurers guild some sort of major feat for the character, or have them already in it. Otherwise, joining feels meaningless. Another protip would be to think of catchier names for towns and people. I know that seems like nitpicking. But it helps your world to make it memorable.And here's a protip for using the RPG VX ACE maker. I noticed this when I stepped on a patch of tall grass, and it looked like I was floating on top of it. If you go into your tilesets, where most tiles have like an X or O on it, there should be an option that looks like 2 wavy lines. I don't have it pulled up right now, so I can't give the actual name for it. But it'll make it to where characters get their lower half shaded when walking over a section. This creates the illusion that your character has the grass coming up to his waist. Just apply it to the tall grass sections and you're good.Overall, it's a game I fell if I do complete, it'll be by force. Sorry guys. This just wasn't your game.			"

												This is probably the first time i'm not recommending a game, so it pains me to do this :( I can see some potential but this is nowhere near production ready; do not put money towards it. I got a copy in a pack of 4 RPGs i wanted to try for ~60p, thankfully.Obvious problems:You get direction for what to do for the first 5 minutes ('Go to the well'), after that, you're free to wander the entire map (and good luck finding a map so you can squint and get an idea of where the hell you are or what you're supposed to be doing.) Quests have no markers - if it says 'go and kill blah', and you don't know where blah is, then so begins a wild goose chase.After you save the miner...you can go back to the mine with the dungeon key and have a go at the fire boss...but not if you can't equip a shield.It might just be because i picked the mage class, but i couldn't equip a shield despite buying everything possible (currency is nowhere near balanced, items cost ~30 gold and you can earn 1000s in minutes). No shield? No hope in hell of beating the elemental bosses. Was i supposed to buy 99 health potions and spam those instead??? (for shame)While normal attack damage is ok and different weapons do different AoE areas (the combat system is quite interesting actually), magic is realllllly weak :/ like not even worth having. It's good for long distance but not when it does 10 damage against an enemy with 1000s of HP - who doesn't always stay STILL - who has time for that?Enemies are all overpowered - i got to ~lvl 16 and even the wasps were taking off ~1/5 of my health per attack. Only the rats in the well at the very start of the game seem like they're at the right level for your character, and if you go back down there, they can divebomb you to hell and back in seconds. The screen is littered with annoyance after annoyance and they don't scale with you nor drop anything significant. You're thrown in at the deep-end and get nothing for not drowning.You can only save at the green flames and not the barely-existent menu, which i thought was a bit annoying because you have to backtrack to the last village and hope you can remember where it is in that village/town - some sign posts really wouldn't go amiss.NPCs are pretty lifeless - if you ever even find one, chances are they'll just talk about their house (i found books in ONE house, all the other houses are window dressing :/) Ok, Sir/Madam, your house is nice and all....(not if there's nothing to loot lol) but how about some lore or something? Why go on???I don't hate the game, but it really needs a lot of work. Tone down the difficulty (there doesn't have to be an enemy everywhere), scale enemies to class and level - battles are supposed to be FUN. Put in more 'where to go if you're stuck' (signposts!) . Know your characters - do we get a party at some point?? Why are we being forced by some flying bird to collect all the elements? Because it will 'reap our soul' otherwise? Well that's very nice of it???? haha			"

But if you bought this game on sale for 25c or for anything less then a dollar it's a good price. it's an interesting rpg maker game that is zelda esque.

												Rather than writing a deep expansive review that will probably just bore you within the first paragraph, I thought I would change it up by just simply get down to the brass tacks.This game was made using the RPG Maker VX Ace Engine, therefore it presents the same problems that just about every other RPG Maker game presents. Sadly, these issues are just simply the mechanical limitations of RPG Maker, not developer errors, therefore I cannot fault the game on these issues. Putting the issues of RPG Maker aside, I really wanted to like this game, however it does have its problems. The first problem I had was a very noticable drop in FPS while in larger open areas. This FPS drop really slows down movement and becomes a quick nuisance. This issue is fixed when entering a building or cave, etc however presents itself again when re-entering the large area.Second problem I have are the controls. The controls are really bad in my opinion and have somewhat of a learning curve as you cannot change them. Granted you can remap controls using Xpadder or another re-mapping program if you have a controller, I feel I shouldnt have to use another program to get the controls you want.As I said previously, I am not going into a great amount of detail with this one. The two problems are my main issues, as of right now, therefore you want to know about other game issues or gameplay mechanics, check out some of the other reviews. They are chalk full of plenty of information.I gave this a prositive rating becuase I believe this game had potential and with some issues aside it really isn't all that bad for the price, especially if you pick it up in a bundle on sale.

												This is a pretty cool game that can be quite good if you can be patient with it.  It reminds me somewhat of the Y's games, despite it playing more like an old Zelda game.There are a few different classes to choose from, which determines a lot of the equipment you can use.  I do wish that it was more clear when shopping whether or not your character can use that item (perhaps I am just overlooking this), but common sense generally solves these cases (or you waste currency, which isn't a big deal since changing screens respawns enemies and you can quickly farm them).6/10 - Not outstanding, but worth the asking price and worth checking out.  Don't go into it with high expectations..			"

												There's a lot wrong with this game. I think the movement for dashing is a little to fast and the enemies starting out ( Slimes) are able to one shot you if you're not careful. I found you are able to move through a lot of walls and bosses are a joke if you buy health potions. However, I think the combat system is fun for what it is and quests add a little extra flavor. I bought this game for a dollor and while I'd never spend any more than that for this game I would still recommend it to others as a low quality rpg.			"

												it's worth the little i paid for it... but not much more. I bought it for the trading cards and the badges look really cool, but the game has a juggling problem... a serious one.Pretty much, if the enemy puts a paralize or stun proc on you, your finished, regardless of your level. Also, the enemies get stronger and stronger as you level up so there really is no point in leveling other than it will take longer to kill every 'bad guy'. I believe there is a crafting system in the game as you can get resources and parts as drops but i haven't come accross anything in the amount that i played. All in all, its a great effort to make a real time stratergy game that is done in an old rpg format which makes it creditable, i just wish the game didn't have a leveling system that makes it harder as you kill more or procs that will make it impossible to live.

												Do Not BUY!!! To say this game was inspired by Zelda: A Link to the past is an insult to Zelda. Zelda and this game literally have nothing in common other that both games contain swords and monsters. The battle system is super wonky. If playing on a Xbox 360 game pad the sensitivity makes this game uncontrollable due to tiny deadzone.  No way of changing control sensitivity. The screen shots are lies. The game looks blurry and not crisp. There is no way to change the resolution. This  results in the game looking terrible and making half of the books and maps unreadable. Leveling system is flawed no matter what level or armor the monsters will always kill you in 4 hits or less. I paid $0.50 for this and 3 other games and I still want my money back. Do Not BUY!!!

												This is a overhead view rpg.It is in the style of the old Final Fantasy games, but the fights are not the same way as them. It has good music, no voice actors or words in the music. It is a short game with 2 playable characters. Boy or Girl, depending on what you pick in the start.This game has a good reason to give you your starting gear, the npcs look nice with faces drawn in a none moving fasion, but the naming of some of them could be better. To fight someone run up to them and press (Z) to attack with weapon, (A) with spell and (S) for shield. You can see all the enemys as you walk along so if you want to you can skip alot of the creeps. The mobs will level up with you but the bosses wont. There is a job you pick in the start that will let you equipt some weapons but not all types of weapons or armor. There is a forge to upgrade your weapon but it seems like it can not upgrade my scythe, but you can even put an element to your wand. The spells for the players are few.There is about 2 quests that you have to do to progress, the rest are optional, even one can be found in a book. You have a quest log, an inventory, fixed saving spots, a donation system, fixed gambling and no character costumesation only picking the gender. The weapons attack differently compaired to each other atleast most of them. There is also 5 achievements that will be easy to get, card drops and some sweet looking badges.If this sounds like something for you then you could get it as it is a really cheap game, but wait for a sale. Have fun, enjoy and slash 'em all :)			"

												Overall I give this game an 8.5/10. Reasons? Look below:Pros: - Relaxing BGM- Old style RPG aspects (which i enjoy)- Nothing too complicated- I believe 7 classes to choose from- Nothing that can really make you rage- Simple and easy to get right in toCons:- Quests don't really lead you to who to talk to next (What i mean is after were done with quests in the first village there is nothing really pointing out saying ""Hey go to next village no more quests here for now"" something like that or I just be lazy and want a marker who knows.)- The point of classes (You get to pick any class but you get to buy any of the weps anyways and armors so why the need of a class picker?)- Err... nothing else besides the 2 aboveConclusion:To end this on a good note its the type of game you can just sit back and relax to when you have the feeling to just go back to the original aspects of simple RPGs. I recommend this to anyone who just have free time off their hands and don't mind taking the time to thoroughly play this game.			"

												Secret of Magia takes a big nod to Zelda and makes you feel nastalgic right away. A RPG maker game, you play as either a boy -Kerzok or girl -Kany and explore the world while fighting a tyrannical bad guy and elemental dungeons.  The intro to the game is a dream of ''collect 4 elements or ill reap your soul'' basically tells you what your in for.  Choose between being  an assasin, ninja,soldier,archer,mage or palidan. No matter what you choose though you equip a sheild of some sort and gain cool items through the game like the hookshot. A simple game in typical RPG fashion you can beat it fairly easy  with good fun in making your  character better with alchemy and forging crafting by collecting materials. A little skill and remember that the monsters in this game lv up with you. So even/watch out your gear and your lv so your not outdone by the monsters fast. Skill also helps!			"

												Initial Review (bear in mind I only played for an hour before deciding I wouldn't like it):1. Introduction was quick enough.  However, my interest wasn't piqued much.  A strange bird tells you to get all four elements or he'd reap your soul.  You get to choose your gender and class (assassin, archer or mage).  That's it.  2. You wake up in a city and you're being told what to do next exactly.  The game pushes you in the direction you have to go.  Not much thought process involved at all.3. The combat system is Zelda-like; Secret of Magia is an action RPG where you press Z to swing your weapon, S to block with a shield, A to cast a spell.  Easy enough at first, but you can be one-shot by some enemies as melee rather easily if you don't act quickly enough.  The shield that I bought from the weaponmaker after receiving the license in town didn't seem to be working either (and I made sure to equip it, too).  And the monsters really do move too fast for you to avoid them sometimes. 4. There are background bugs everywhere.  Cliffs and walls are passable when they shouldn't be, etc.5. No proofreading has been done for this game, apparently.  Dialogue is full of typos and misspellings - you'll be talking to plenty of 'Gaurds,' for example - and even with that fixed, it's not particularly memorable.  Many of the NPC's lines are nothing special.  ""I love my nice house!""  One guard said that they couldn't drink in the watchtower and giggled as he said it - which seemed weirdly out of place.6. Quests are discovered by talking to NPCs with an exclamation point or by examining books or so on - they seem to be straightforward but there was one quest that pointed out a location of a dagger while giving you coordinates.  I'm not sure how that would have been accomplished without an add-on telling you X and Y coordinates of the map you were on.  Granted, I didn't play long enough to try to figure it out.7. Did I mention you could be one-shot rather easily?  Now there aren't enough save points to really help you avoid a lot of experience and gold loss if that happens.  I decided not to risk entering the mines and try to find a save point because of it in the next town up.  This isn't really a criticism.  I like the challenge, but it can probably be discouraging to some.8. The Dash function is default (and essential in avoiding monsters); however the game's frame rate doesn't seem to be very smooth when you're dashing.  I've seen this done better in other RPGMaker games like Labyronia.  It's a bit distracting in this game.9. There are two different ways you can use items: through equipping them, and by using the Q-W quick item equipper.  I think the item equipper could have probably been removed to simplify up the UI a bit in that respect.10. There was a map inside the training hall in the first city that showed you the first few areas as if they were zoomed out.  I play RPGs to explore areas myself, so that map kind of took away most of the mystery of the first few areas for me.All in all, unfortunately I wouldn't recommend this game.  EDIT: I bought it on sale ($1) and still feel ripped off - and now I find out from reading other reviews, if I had kept playing, I would have completed it in 2.5 to 3 hours anyway... I feel like there are a lot of better games for your money's worth.  Labyronia for one, which I mentioned.			"

												Well I can say that this game had me excited. A retro rpg had caught my eye and I was well convinced this was a good buy and I still don't regret playing it. I don't know if I was the only one, but only the first 1/4 of the game was actually scripted with quests and events. This was rather dissapointing, as I was expecting some really good developed plot to just slap me in the face. After obtaining the three elements, you get an attrocious sentence or two as your ending, and you are returned to the opening page. Just awful and depressing. Gameplay was simple and enjoyable but it looked like there was a lot of thought missing from the last half of the game that I was so upset with. It was really rushed and undeveloped and I think devs  should consider adding more quests. It's a great game but wrongly executed.			"

												This is a generic RPG Maker game that has the right price on sale, but isn't really worth your time. There's no story (collect 4 elements), 5 side quests (i was actually surprised by this) and a small world. Combat is in the world instead of a separate screen, but it doesn't really matter. The game is simply boring to play, and leveling up is almost useless because the enemies get stronger too. They only give a little more money. There's 6 classes, but it doesn't really matter. The assets and music are generic and the game is unpolished. But at least it's short (around 2 hours).  Even if i enjoyed it a bit, i can't recommend it in the end.			"

The whole no map thing can be a bit annoying because you end up wandering lost beyond belief.  The ending... well... it leaves something to be desired.  That said, still a cute game.  I wish the dev team would add a bit, make it feel more complete.  Overall... it was a nice, simple, zelda meets pokemon rpg.  Crafting, armour, and level seems to be pretty much an undeveloped afterthought.  Good for a go round or two, and besides, you get to be a ninja.  Win!			"

												The game has the potential to be a great RPG game. However, there are a lot of places where it needs work to be a great game. First, it doesn't explain the various classes to allow you to play to your style of playing. Second, there are only two magic spells in the entire game, not including the few weapons that attack using only magic. Third, it appears you will be able to have and it talks about you having a party to use during the game, but you play the whole game with one of the two characters you chose at the start of the game. Fourth, the level system seems pointless as all the monsters seem to take the same number of hits regardless of what your level is or what you have equiped, and likewise so do you. Fifth, there are only four quests in addition to the four dungeons in the entire game. Sixth, talking to non-quest giving and non-shop characters is pointless as they won't help you figure out what you need to do next, such as what to do to gain access to the Wind Dungeon, which is a pain to figure out. Seventh, SPOILER WARNING the end is extremely anticlimatic and is one of the worst, if not the worst, I have ever seen in a game.			"

												MAY CONTAIN POTENTIAL SPOILERS, READ ON AT OWN RISK. What started off as a nice little adventure ended in a huge disappointment. The game feels very rushed and I was able to easily beating the final boss without even passing level 20. It has little to no story at all and doesn't tell you why you're there other than that you're supposed to collect the souls of four beasts. My biggest disappointment with this was the ending. Basically if I beat the final boss on a game I expect some sort of reward like.. I don't know maybe explain why you did what you just did and what finally became of your character?? The devs were in such a hurry to finish this game they never even bothered with that, nor the credits. Nope it just sends you right back to the main menu. What about the class system? Learning class-related skills would have improved it alot, without that it doesn't really matter what class you pick. Hell the ninja can carry heavy hammers or crossbows if it wants which makes alot of sense. If I was to name something possible in all this it was the soundtrack which was very nice, one of the first things I noticed. 2/10.			"

												Game has lots of empy space, most NPCs say the most worthless filler text ever, poor mapping, graphic errors, poor storyline, text wrapping errors, items that you can pick up infinite times, game breaking bugs where you can't obtain key items, overpowered enemies, lots of grinding, useless game mechanics, can't combo spells properly as there's a limit on how often enemies can be hit by the same attack even though there's a combo system, and more.I was hoping for more out of this game, but since I hit a game breaking bug where I can't rechallenge the first boss, I'm done.Game should be fixed and re-released for free.

												It pains me to give this title a ""Not Recommended"" review, but because of a few things in the game that actually break the game and it's progression, I have no choice.Pros:+ Neat music+ Decent visuals for RPG Maker game+ Interesting battle mechanics (not JRPG, hack n slash [mash])+ Side quests+ Plenty to explore+ Lots of items and different weapons to try out+ Minor ""crafting"" feature+ Good amount of save spots (you'll need them)+ Steam trading cardsCons:- Strange battle mechanics (sometimes buggy)- No story line (kind of to be expected)- Very easy to end up dead if you mess up- Game breaking bugs (don't back track in the dungeons or you're SOL and have to restart from the beginning*)- I'm pretty sure the achievements are bugged (I used SAM to unlock the ones that I KNEW I got, like sleeping in an inn)- Very short game (somewhat expected though)- Grammatical and spelling errors (doesn't really bother me much)- What's with that ending? IE: Bad ending! (Spoiler: This is the ending - ""..."" [Flash to Title Screen])* The game breaking bug is that essentially after you get the key while you're IN the dungeon, if you go forward, unlock that door, (save or not), and then backtrack - you have to get that key again.  Unfortunately when you try to unlock that door AGAIN, it doesn't work.  The game is broken completely in that sense.What I don't really get about the company that made this game is why?  You can clearly make a solid game and develop it thoroughly.  Why wouldn't you put in the extra effort to develop the game more?  Fill out the story line, add more game mechanics, items, and worthwhile quests.  Add more sections to the game and give it more direction so people can enjoy it more.  There's so many things you COULD do to a game like this, and yet it seems so rushed out that it's disappointing.This game has and had so much potential but unfortunately it's squandered by the developers decision to cheap out on the important aspects and release what feels like a barebones game or even an alpha game.I'm glad that this game has steam trading cards so that I can sell them and recoup my purchase of this game (along with the entire JRPG bundle).  At least I can use the money I get from the cards to buy another bad title to forget about this bad title.In conclusion, if you're truly bored and want something to entertain you for a couple hours - then get this game.  Otherwise, invest your money elsewhere.			"

My full review can be found here.[www.the-backlog.net]Secret of Magia is a game that takes hints from several 2D adventure titles such as Ys, the Mana series, and Zelda. What it fails to do is execute these well and the game just turns into a giant mess. In Secret of Magia, you'll experience game breaking glitches, awful hitboxes, poor English, and a game that just isn't very long at all. The game has a grand total of five dungeons available, though only four of them are actually required to beat the game.One of the things in Secret of Magia that made absolutely no sense to me was why the enemies scaled with your level. I very quickly decided to not even bother with killing anything but what was required to even proceed. When it comes to the bosses, it doesn't even really matter if you're underleveled. All you have to do is stand to the side of where they can hit, and so long as they don't have some sort of area of effect skill they just can't hit you. One NPC remarked that you needed a shield to beat a particular boss. This boss was actually one of the only ones I couldn't abuse this hitbox effect on and I still never even used the shield (playing as a Paladin).Secret of Magia holds some good promises but completely fails to deliver on them. Many glitches are being left unchecked, such as being locked out of dungeons forcing you to restart the entire game and the Scythe just not being upgradeable. There are much better games in this style out there, so my suggested is to just play those instead and pass on Secret of Magia. Unless, of course, you don't mind smashing your head into awful English and poor hitboxes.			"

												Where to start?  Well, it has things to do...  but not very many..Main components of the game are missing....(Pocket Watch) (King) (Arbok code guy) (an ending)...I played this game very slowly... It took me 3 hours to beat it and another 2 to figure out that classes and choices do NOT matter in this game.  I can't say that I'm upset about buying it.  I enjoyed playing.  It had a few really good ideas, like crafting and smithing, classes, cool equipment drops from bosses... It just hurts my heart so deeply that the majority of those things arent finished. I walked to the Smith. Saw the item list.  Went back to town and bought a bunch of each item.  Smithed until I was poor and Level 7 Smith.  Nope. No progression. No reward. You can upgrade your weapon ONE time. and it isnt very good. Upside?Every enemy is able to be killed by standing one block to the side of it, diagonally in any direction, and just hitting it with your weakest weapon. You can run through this whole game, killing only who you have too. Money, potions, weapons, magic, items... they mean nothing.  They are completely worthless.SOOOO... quick recap:Unfinished game.No real rewarding content.No actual Ending to the game, though the game does end.I won't tell you how to live your life, but I don't recommend buying this game, my friend.EDIT:Game also will not award me with all achievements even though I have completed all of them.

												Secret of Magia has encouraged me to write my first review, so I guess that's good.  So now all the pros are covered, let's get to the cons.This is by far one of the worst 'games' I have ever played.To say this 'game' is bug ridden is an understatement.  Randomly walk thru walls?  Check.  Exits not linked properly?  Check.  Random graphic glitches?  Check.  Items that don't do what they say they are suppose to?  Check.  Typos all over?  Check.  Items that you can repeatably loot over and over?  Check.  Good luck getting the five laughable easy to get achievements.  It randomly can take dozens of tries to trigger it, despite doing the same thing literally every single time before.The 'game' itself is horribly linear with no story and no direction given.  You are punished for leveling up, as the foes grow in power much faster than you do from gaining levels.  Classes make little to no difference in play style or abilities.  Archers are even more punished by having a limit of 99 arrows.  It can take 10 to kill a single foe, forcing them to use the basic knife most of the time.  Gold flows so much so you can easily afford to get full stacks of every usable item in the 'game'.  Not that his helps much, as foes do so much damage by mid game that getting hit once or twice can kill you and getting stun locked happens too much.To top it all off, it's maybe only a few hours long.  This is not an early release game or alpha, yet it clearly plays as if it was.  For 2.99 you can do much better.  Even free, in this current state of release, don't bother.			"

												I like the retro style, but with that being said, there is absolutely no ingenuity with this game. There is basically no storyline and there is no plot--just beat a few bosses, get the last guy, the end! ***Spoilers To Follow***This is the most basic of game designs. Defeat around 4 or 5 bosses and unlock the gates to the final boss. There is dialogue in this game but it might as well have none since 90% is non-informational and irrelevant to the plot. Wait--there is no plot--nevermind. There were some cool aspects to this game, but it needed more people working on it or something.Also, there are bugs. But for around $1.00, who cares? Nothing too bad.Lastly, I beat the game (thinking I was only in the beginning) and the final boss says ""So you did it..."" or something to that effect. Then I was put to the title screen. I believe anyone could design a game better for $1.00, but I didn't feel I wasted my money. Just my time.Hope the developers do not take this in a wrong way, but if you are going to charge (even for a tiny amount), have something worth it there. In the end, I should have skipped this one.Also the achievements did not work for me.Wish this game had more to it as I think it could stand out with substantial improvement. The bones of the structure are there and good, but nothing added to it. 3/10			"

I cannot  tell if the player's stats are not going up or if the enemies stats are always higher than the player's.There is no rhyme or reason to this game. I got lost very quickly. The NPCs don't really tell you too much about what dungeon you are going to after the first dungeon.

												I bought this game from a quad pack of rpg maker games.  The pack cost me I believe a dollar for all 4 games.  Even with the fact this game was 25 cents.  The loss of time I could have been playing other games makes it not worth it.1. Leveling doesn't matter. - All creatures level with you, be it the starting rats, or bosses.  They give more xp and more gold every time you level and go to a new screen.  This removes the element of leveling altogether really and frankly I don't understand why you level in this game, other than the fact the maker knows leveling is important some how.2. Story line might exist? - The story line is so lackluster that you could argue there isn't one.  I would argue there isn't one.  This is the best I could come up with for storyline ""I wake/call on your soul to kill the 4 elemental gods and bring them to me""  That is it, there are 5 quests otherwise that sort of vaguely lead you towards your goal and only the frostfire dagger quest is interesting in my opinion. 3. Combat is terrible - There are multiple classes and I chose the paladin since I thought it would be neat to block.  There is no block animation and I saw no reason to do it ever.  The cooldown on enemy attacks is so low that the time it takes to block, recover your ""stamina"" to swing makes it so that NO monster makes it viable.  By the end of the game I was killing every creature the exact same as I started with. stand slightly to the left of it and use a weapon with a wider arc then just ahead of me.  This killed everything in the game by just spamming attack.In all honesty I think this was someones first attempt at making a game and for a groundwork attempt its not terrible, however, this should not have been released for public use.  It just lacks everything in every category.  You can see where the ideas got laid down and the creator has potential if they can flesh out the game and do their own thing. However this game is SO bad, NO ONE has written a guide. No one thought the game had enough depth or importance to write how to beat it.  That is how bad it is.  Even if you get this game for free, even if you receive it accidently as part of a pack.  Do Not Waste Your Time.  Spend your free time doing anything else like watch paint dry.  Or you know play an actually good game.			"

												Many free browser RPGs are better than this one. The story is empty, many NPC/locations are just useless, bugs everywhere, can be finished in 2 hours...It really feels like a unfinished game.Well, if I had to find a good point, it'll probably be the music, it's probably the only thing in this game that I liked.

												A for effortE for execution Full price of $3 is a bit streching it considering all the bugs, glitchers and flaws in the general design of the game. Feels like an early access game with all the bugs. As the game currently stands I wouldn't recommend this game.Pros - Real time action combat- Retro RPG style (if your in to those things)- Currently on sale $1.79 is a reletively cheap game.Cons -Minor bugs with achievements needing to done multiple times-Many bugs such as walking into the background (multiple instances), walking through physical objects.-Mobs drop way way way too much gold compared how much items and equipments cost.-Lack of any direction, becomes more of a puzzle game. Might be a good thing? -Game starts off with 'gimmi the 4 souls of the elements our ill reap your soul'-Movement with the green grass backdrop kills your eyes. -Feels like a early access game-Using the 'Sharp Knife"" feels over powered. Once you get your first hit on a mob, due to your atk speed they can't retaliate.			"

												I'm sorry but I don't really care for this game. I keep getting tossed back into the inventory by accidently hitting the wrong button. Also, it keeps telling me to use something or equip something every step I take. Although the combat is much better then the last RPG game I've played, the story didn't captured me in a way to keep me playing. (Edit) Finally figured out how to use the hookshot, I guess I clicked through to fast to see how to use it lol. The info text on top of the screen isn't displayed fully either, so to see the full information on some things you will have to go to your inventory. Characters move really fast too. And fullscreen worked fine for me. This just isn't the game for me, but it might be for other fans of this genre.			"

												Secret of Magia is a game with a lot of potential going for it and a great concept overall. While I don’t like when developers bring in other games as a selling point (which also sets the bar really high), you can see that the developers had a clear idea of what they wanted to do. Unfortunately they were held back by the limits of RPG Maker, which made the game worse than it should have been. An original battle system, but extremely easy to abuse. And while the game wasn’t designed for story purposes, I can’t forget about how uninteresting the characters were, how clichéd the story was and how extremely disappointing the ending was. As much as I hate to say it, Secret of Magia is a game that needs to get back to the drawing board or get all of its issues fixed, because as of now, it’s a mess.Full Article here[www.gamerselite.co.uk] "

												It's missing a few key things - but if you like this genre it's probvably worth perserving with.  For a proper recommendation this game needs:- windowed mode (or a better resolution)- controller support - a better tutorial It's not a bad game, but these things prevented me from playing this for any length of time.

Full DisclosureI was given this a copy game by the developer(s) (or someone in contact with them) to review.ReviewSecret of Magia is a bit of an interesting title for me, at first I was rather enjoying it. It had an OK story, some character progression and even some nice things like a HookShot! Unfortunately it went downhill from there (and before that even). I personally played this game with an Xbox 360 controller, as that's what I generally enjoy playing this style of game with. Sadly there appears to be no documentation of the controls for it. So here's roughly what they seem to be for me:A - Run/Walk + HookshotB - Menu (Really odd binding IMO)X - Attack/InteractY - MagicLB - ShieldSelect - Quick Menu (also used for cycling between quick menus)Start - Also used for cycling quick menus, but cannot be used to access it in the first place)RB/LT/RT - Appear to be unused.Now while the game was fun for the first hour or so, unforunately it simply became a grindfest of bugs and dull combat. It is worth noting that I played as a Paladin class, so other classes *may* be more interesting, but for me it simply consisted of standing diagonally from an enemy and spamming the attack button (the cooldown on combos seems very short IMO). This tactic ends up changing slightly for enemies that have a ranged attack as I will simply attack them head on because they have no melee secondary attack, leaving them essentially paralyzed while I attack them. Magic attacks are OK, but they have no cooldown meaning they can easily be spammed. (I only seemed to have access to a fire spell and ice spell as a Paladin, with the ice being a sort of ball shot straight ahead, and the fire being multiple revolving fireballs). Now you might seem to think that combat isn't so bad from this, but enemies get tougher the higher level you are, the problem is that while their health gets ever higher my attack doesn't seem to level at the same rate (or at all), with most monsters now taking up to 70 (yes seventy) hits to defeat at level 16 with the best weapons I currently have.I also have ended up with virtually endless money as well from every monster I come across up to the first boss, meaning I can basically never die by drinking as many life potions as needed due to them having no cooldown.It is also worth noting that the game has no hint system or in-game map (short of the maps you can find on tables in some houses). I have played through as much of the game as I can, but I cannot find a key item, despite knowing roughly where it is, this is also despite having the key item that should come after it (as far as I know).SPOILERS:I cannot find the Wind Element, I assume it is in the catacombs but I do not know how to get in there as it appears to have a never ending staircase (as seen in Super Mario 64). I also already have the Fire, Ice and Earth Elements.Now I suppose we must move onto the bugs I discussed earlier. Some of these have already been mentioned in other reviews, but I will mention them again nonetheless.- The lighting engine appears to be broken entirely, I didn't realise this until looking at the screenshots now with their lovely lighting, yet my game appears to be running at max brightness with no shadows or dynamic lighting of any kind, the game looks almost completely different without it.- Many objects are solid for no apparent reason (such as foliage, there are some flowers that are seemingly identical, yet one is solid, the other isn't)- Many walls aren't solid (e.g. Multiple walls in the Church aren't solid meaning you (and NPCs) can walk on them.- There's a key that you can pick up In the Ancient Forest in an area with a Waterfall and Cave that I can pick up as many times as I want for no apparent reason, I now have 7 of said key in my inventory.- This is not necessarily a bug per se, but I noticed that after a couple of hours of playing my ears were beginning to hurt, the sound effects for melee attacks appears to be rather harsh, thankfully I was able to disable this via the RPGMaker menu (F1).Really I just don't think I can recommend this game, it has too many bugs, combat has become tedious (I avoid as many enemies as I can now), and it just wasn't a particularly fun experience (apart from the first 30min-1hr). Maybe once Secret of Magia gets updated a bit I'll revisit it and update my review, but for now I cannot recommend it.			"

												We agree with most of the views that the game has potential and for an Action RPG the game plays actually well.  Unfortunately the game is littered with bugs and has a few showstoppers that makes the game unplayable. We aren't bothered about the price of the game - its actually good value but at present feels like an early access game with the bugs left intact. We recommend you stay away from this one. (1/10).

												Even for $1.79, it's not worth it.Heavily inspired by The Legend of Zelda, Arc the Lad, and Secret of Mana =/= heavily ripping those games off and not even having the mechanics work correctly or be enjoyable at all. The game plays the most like a poor man's Secret of Mana. Hell, Final Fantasy Adventure (Seiken Densetsu- the actual first Secret of Mana) on the Gameboy was more entertaining than this in its monochromatic glory.There may be some halfway decent concepts here and there (like adding what I assume is crafting...it's been done before but is cool to see for an old school ""inspired"" ARPG), but those are negated by the god awful combat system, complete lack of story, rehashed ideas/assets, and terrible decision to have monsters level up wtih you (works for some games, but not one like this). 2/10 - With RPG Maker games, most of your work is already done for you. 1 point for it being somewhat playable, 1 point for spending at least a little time on it. We've been here before, folks. And it was way better the first time around.			"

												Cons:-Game is too short-The smithing system is not useful, and unfinished-At the beginning it felt like there would be more quests, but instead there were only a couple, one of which I don't think was even implemented.-My Inn achevement was bugged, so I couldn't get it.Pros:+The magic swords you get from bosses was a cool idea, and if that wasnt a part of the game, the darkness dungeon would be unbeatable as any of the swordsman classes.+Forgiving difficulty, but not too easy either.Not bad, just unfinished I would say. For the price I got it for (in a bundle of four games for 0.50$) it was passable. I fyou can get it for cheap, do it. "

												I'm normally a bit generous towards low budget indie RPGMaker games but I really can't recommend it.  It has a number of problems:-The game needs a proofreader.  There's spelling, grammar and punctuation mistakes all over the place.-Features are introduced early on in the game and then forgotten.  The hookshot is used about a half dozen times in the first 15 minutes, then never again.  Crafting is the same way.-Enemies level alongside you, making fighting largely pointless.-The plot and world is bare bones and mostly generic.-Bad scripting in some places.  In Oblivia, I stayed  at the inn.  When I left the inn I found myself back at the inn at the beginning of the game.-Very underwhelming ending.  The final boss says ""Well Done"" when you defeat him and then dumps the player back to the title screen-The player can choose one of several character classes, but it doesn't seem to have much of an impact on anything other than the weapons you can use.On the other hand, the game is very short so speedrunners might like it, and the achievements are easy.

												I wanted to like this game, but it's simply making it too hard. For the price, it's not too bad - but it has some serious flaws. If you're looking for something to kill a bit of time, it's fine, but I feel like it could have been so much more.Pros:It's a cute little game overall, it has an interesting battle system, which I definitely like, however, that's about all it has going for it. The different attacks of the monsters gives an interesting challenge.Cons:Although there are occasionally some nice graphics, the overall mapping is rather dull. Every house has the same layout and almost the same interior, the outside is rather lifeless.The story and characters seem one-dimensional and without any purpose.Possibly most glaring, there's a huge balancing problem. The monsters' combat abilities scale with your level, and it doesn't do it very well.Other than that there are a lot of obvious glitches that should have been fixed by now. It's really a shame, because the game does have some potential.			"

It's too unbalanced, no real difference between hero classes (since each of them may use the same two weapons you could call a cheat), at the same time playing as an archer or a mage  really sucks, no fasttravel, some bugs and some other little nuances that make the game nearly unbarable.

												well after having tried playing this a few times i can say this game has its upsides so lets focus on that firstpositives:- different classes- easy to learn- real time waster- different weapons corresponding to the class so the class choices actually matter (only archer can pick a bow and arrow, assassin gets scythes, ninja gets katana and so on)negatives:- difficulty spikes can show up right after the class has been picked (the slimes outside of the starting town can be firing one shot or 2 or 3 or be a mg and you have no incibility frame so try to not line up with the slimes as theres no telling when they go rapid fire, and when they do and you get shot theres no way of healing up inbetween the shots)- no clear way of where to go (i just stumble upon things at random for example i stumpled upon the location of the first quest the sensei of the first town gives by pure accident and got my ♥♥♥ whooped cause of status ailment burn which deals damage over time, yeah fine thats fair, but the difficulty should rise bit by bit not be mlg pro at level 2)- the class description when picking should mention what type of weapons you can use with that class cause some arent as obvious- i have yet to find out what the lantern is for, it doesnt seem to do anything so does your character in the start say you should equip it? beats meso with that said, im kinda in the middle on if i could recommend the game or not. on one side i want to cause action rpgs are great when done right, and on paper this did it decently well, but on the other side the difficulty spike makes it difficult for me to recommend it. so buy with caution if you are easily enraged by video games going difficult too fast			"

												Secret Of Magia All I can say thats good about this game is it's fun.the type of fun you get spinning around in your chair until you get dizzy.honestly the sensation of vommiting is a little more interesting and interactive then the overall gameplay after experiencing it.Not to make it sound harsh because this game is a little fun, the Idea of the combat system was COOL! but the execution of it was terrible and funny at the same time.because honestly getting killed by a hornet when I'm lvl 16 and how there is NO dmg reduction at all when I had armour ON! was hilarious. ""sob"" ""sob"" and made me feel stupid. ""sob"" ""sob"" Because equiping and having gear in a rpg to me is the main focal point of any rpg experience.But in this game the gear it's litterally a condom.A condom that was put on incorrectly to be exact.Because you think your well protected with this Supposably OP gear but in the end you find out it was made out of cheap plastic thats breaks open when any sort of pressure is put on it.""cough"" ""cough"" My butt ""cough"" ""cough""ah srry had something stuck in my keyboard that made it cough battery acid but what I was trying to say was.A condom in my butt, but enough weirdo comments aside now.Do I reccomend this game?Yes ""because I want you to waste your money like I did""But just to warn you it gets boring really fast because of the lack of a good storyline and the little change gear and leveling does to your character.

												Secret of Magia is RPG with a very short story behind it and very few quest to do, it offer a kind of clunky combat since there is a main attack, a skill and a guard if you have your shield equipped, but you can only attack in four directions, like up/down or left/right, doesnt let you do  diagonal attacks, wich make the gameplay wierd and its worst to avoid enemies that way since you are always align with them to do damage.You are free to explore the world and take up quests, the ones you find off course, bc there isnt any kind of information related to that, nor the game give you any tips, you have to talk with every body to find out, the leveling is fast and fluid, but at some point is kind of annoying while doing quests bc as moving to and from areas will respawn the enemies every time, and if you are playing without swords, that may be a issue since Archers and Mages will have hard time to kill enemies after you level a little (the enemies also level with you), since the skills available are weak and useless bc they almost dont do damage(the moment you try the OP swords, anything else is a waste of effort). Secret of Magia still is interesting Action RPG game, and for its price, it does deliver, but it also true that, there are better options here on steam on that regard, unless you are in the RPG theme and enjoy little adventures from time to time, you wouldnt like the experience otherise.
