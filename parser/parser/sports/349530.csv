												Nice, Fun game. This is an arcade game. Not close to DBC but enjoyable. Batting is still challenging and my bowlers get wacked. this is good, I have lots to learn about this game.			"

												This is a nice, fun arcadey cricket game to pick up and play for all ages. Yes there's problems like one resolution at the moment but this kind of stuff will be fixed soon enough. Nice depth with the world tour mode for good replayability and online works well too. Very fun online with friends. If you're looking for a fun relaxed cricket game this is the one for you.			"

												Fantastic little title.I got this to play when I have friends pop round for game nights.It went down great  tonight with my buddies.It has a series of different game modes. Including a world tour.The resolution is a little funky but a patch is in thew works to add resolution options.Now if you are a die hard cricket fan this may not be for you. Maybe try one of the Don Bradman games instead.If you want a chill, easy to pick up and play title this is definately worth a look.Update - Resolution options have been added now with the last patch.

												I'm recommending this for one main reason: it is fun.This is NOT a fully fledged cricket simulator. This is the Zynga of sports games. That's not a bad thing. It replicates table top cricket with plenty of detail, more than enough of a learning curve to provide a challenge... right off the bat.Graphics are fine, they represent this table sized world with generous detail and colour.Plenty of different shots to learn, and well as all the options when bowling. You can spin it like Warnie, turn the ball into a bullet like Brett Lee, and swing the ball like.... ummm.... no Aussies come to mind.Bugs? Yep, lots. More bugs than moths on a lovely evening at the SCG. One guy hit the ball out of the ground - it went through the stadium, lost into the abbyss, and was only declared a 4. My fielders will either will a ball one step to their side like an Indian fieldsman, or jump across the pitch to get a ball as if Jonty Rhodes has Superman powers, and could cheat. Yet to try online, though it should be great if done right			"

												The controls are fluent, it's really fun to play... FOR THE FIRST 5 MINUTES. After you bat, you bowl, like in normal cricket, but in this game I cannot figure out how to bowl if my life depended on it. I select where I want to bowl, then hit A (or enter) but then the game just seems to give up and leave you staring at your screen wondering why you payed 10 dollars for it.Overall:The batting is really fun and fluent, you will never see me without a smile once I've hit a six against England. Really, it's just the bowling that is the sledgehammer to the gut for me.EDIT: I've found out how to bowl but I shouldn't have to review the controls/mash buttons mindlessly to find out how to bowl...

												Overall, this is a really fun game. The World Tour is most enjoyable with its various challenges. If I have any gripes, it's that some of the shot challenges are very difficult, especially the backfoot one in the USA segment of the world tour, which seems to require more backfoot shots than the keyboard instructions show you. Also, the ""late cut"" challenge doesn't seem to recognise when I play a late cut. Mind you, it's very hard to press all the requisite keys at once. When I try to play a back-foot on drive for instance, my batsman keeps leaving the ball instead. I really can't understand why that is. But that issue aside, I have mostly had a lot of fun with this game. Definitely a cool way to play cricket on a computer!			"

												This is a surprisingly fun little game. There is no Tutorial, so make sure you turn on the Tips in the options for the first couple games. It's not a game for someone who wants a serious in depth cricket game, more for some casual fun. The only downside is that the fielding is frustrating.			"

												Really light game to just relax and enjoy.Fielding is a bit surprising with a pouch between legs of fielders to stop the ballThe stadium environment is great and a rocketing six gives a whistling soundBatting tutorial can be of help if addedThank you Big Ant!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												Its a casual game just to do some timepass. Do not take things seriously and DO NOT compare it with DBC14 as its completely different type. It is just to spend 20-30 minutes of free time that you have without worrying about settling or doing anything. Just hit and have fun.			"

												Don't get me wrong, this is a fun game, but boy is it horribly made. There are no graphics options (can't even change the default (720p), nor is there a tutorial anywhere in sight. I'm not sure which is worse, but the lack of a tutorial is inexcusable as there's a bit of a learning curve to actually play the game (as there is a huge difference from Don Bradman Cricket 14). If you plug in a controller after you've launched the game, you have to close and re-open the game all over again. The mouse cursor is also constantly spinning, and doesn't disappear even when a controller is plugged in. You can move it to one side, but why is it spinning (and why doesn't go transparent for that matter) in the first place?There's constant crashes and hangs, which just continues to show the game has been badly ported or supported. This is in stark contrast to Don Bradman Cricket 14, which really shines on the PC.Versus Mode doesn't even work properly (or at least it didn't at the time I wrote this). Sure, you can choose to play two players, but once you get into the game, it's just player one against the CPU.I'm a massive Big Ant fan, so I'm not sure what they were thinking on this one, though I have a bit of confidence they'll patch a lot of these issues that really shouldn't be issues.Just as well the price point is lower than on consoles, because it would be unforgivable otherwise. This has clearly been rushed, when it had no reason to be. For a game that was announced in 2012, it's an immense disappointment. Therefore, at the moment, I just cannot recommend this.			"

												JUST AN AWESOME GAME. Another Gem from Bigantstudios.-When i first installed the game , i started the VERSUS mode and played a game with Indoor rules. Ohh Boy, it looked so beautiful. Stands full of crowd . Controls are Good and You get wide range of shots ( 18 different shots). Unlike other cricket games the Bowling is rewarding as well as fun. So you wont get bored after bowling 2 overs. -World tour mode is another good feature which lets you take on the World in Either Ten10,T20, ODI formats. There are many challeges too which you can play in tours.- THE MOST FUN PART IS ONLINE MODE . I played like 4 matches till now and I cant get over it. I want to keep playing and playing. The shortest Format You can play in ONLINE is INDOOR rules. Where you play with anyone in the world or with your friends with Indoor rules. -Well done Bigantstudios. Keep the good work going.Trust me you will feel the same things what i just wrote above when you buy the game. Hoping My review will help a lot of people here .			"

												If you have already purchased dbc, then playing this game would definetly make you look like you wasted $10. If you compare dbc vs table top cricket prizes you will notice a huge price difference and that price difference should indicate that graphics would be low as compared to dbc. Although it is a different concept, I still believe it is not something special. IF you have purchased dbc already, then even if you don't purchase this game, you are not missing out on something big. I would recommend users to buy don bradman, instead of  this game.			"

												This is a beatiful arcade style cricket game so plese do not expect any kind of simulation ,  and because of Work for DBC 2014 done by developers i was curious to try out this game and finally bought this today . Fast 5 format is real fun , specially you are playing with your brothers or relative in 2nd player mode :)I would say this as the best arcade style cricket game ever though my favroite cricket game so far is DBC 2014, waiting for next version :)			"
