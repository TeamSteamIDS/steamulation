								Certainly one to keep an eye on. Bear in mind that, at time of writing, there's no multiplayer or online sharing of tracks, one car and no customisation, and so those looking for lots of gamemodes/content may want to hold off for a bit until we discover if the stuff that's yet to be added is any good. That said, the procedural track generator means that the single player is enjoyable, mostly down to the large variety of tracks that the track generator can give you.So put it on your wishlist for now until more stuff starts getting added in but, if the stuff to be added is anything like whats in the game at the moment, the £15 the devs are asking for seems more than reasonable			"

								4 March - Quick day-one review.- It's Early Access, so it's obviously missing features, but i'm sure you won't regret: stable client, fresh graphics, smooth animations, good sounds, high quality overall, and lots of fun of course... can't wait for the cool features.7 April- They added the first PvP mode as weekly Events. In this competitive mode you race against the best player ghosts of the leaderboard. The track is randomly generated, and the top ghosts are automatically refreshed in real time, even during your lap.26 May- Car Paint mode added. You are free to choose patterns, three colors (on a total of 115, plus Metalness and Roughness effects), three sponsors, and your car number.18 July- Added sharing system and rankings for tracks.

								Its hard to harshly judge the game considering its in alpha, but I do have some concerns I want to express.The menu UI is atrocious at best, it feels like a console menu or rather I am pertty sure it is one, you can't use your mouse to select anything. You are stuck using the arrow keys to navigate and the alt keys to select and go back. If these keys can be changed I would love to know how, because then I could change the controls on how to drive the cars. I don't have a gamepad or wheel (just a joystick) so I am left with using (for me atleast) strange driving controls to race which becomes a nuissance as time goes on. The graphics are pretty good, but they are not well optimized. I can't hold that against them at all though because it is alpha. Currently I can only find the default red racecraft car to use and I am not the biggest fan of its balancing (meaning its acceleration rate, top speed, downforce etc.) and am looking forward to increased customizability of the cars in the future.The best part about this game and, to me at least, makes it stand out from other racing games is the track generation. The procederal engine works most of the time and creates tracks that have a similar flavor but have yet to seem repetetive. Overall I'd say this game has a lot of potential to become one of the greats and I would recomend keeping an eye on it as it develops. "

Early Access Review
								I got early access to this game and was playing it in closed Alpha Thank you for letting me participate, this Game has a lot of potential it looks super awesome the devs have been working on it for a while and even without the in menu Mouse Support I am loving it. I do not own a wheel but play it just fine on Xbox 360 controller. I have played a few hours and did a few videos on it while testing my new Gaming Rig because of the settings and rendering capabilities of the game. This is one of those games you want to get early on and play for hours. So far max settings is bringing 120 fps no screen tearing no lagging just perfect game play you can't ask for a better game than this. don't just load the game up and play it for 5 minutes then do a review saying it's bad.I will update this review as I go because I haven't played everything on the game because it was just released Today and some of the menu, Graphics and other things may have changed during the closed Alpha, get on it let's play. at the time the video was recorded I was using 2x Windforce GTX 770 4GB video cards (were not in SLI) and only 8GB of ram.My computer specs Intel Core i7-6700K 8M Skylake Quad-Core 4.0 GHz LGA 1151 ASRock Z170 Pro4 LGA 1151 Intel Z170 G.SKILL Ripjaws V Series 16GB (2 x 8GB) 288-Pin DDR4 SDRAM DDR4 3000 EVGA GTX 970 4GB Superclocked Microsoft Windows 10 Pro 64-bit I know most people don't have Gaming rigs like this and a lot of people may experience some problems but I also have 3 other computers an i5 3570K @4.4GHz which played the game like a Boss 2 GTX 660 in SLI 8GB DDR3 max settings 60 to 70 fps a 3770k @ 3.8 GHz 2 Windforce GTX 770 4GB in SLI 8GB DDR3 max settings 80 to 90 FPS and last  i5 6600K @ 3.9GHz Windforce GTX Extreme 970 16GB DDR4 Max settings 100 to 110 FPSThe game plays smooth on all settings and I have spent some time playing around with just about everything I haven't found an issue yet, I really want to keep playing just to see what else it has.

Early Access Review
								Yes, this game is a bit rough around the edges.Yes, I don't particularly like Vae Victis.And, yes, if they do this game right, can change my opinion on this game.Don't get me wrong, this game still needs a hell of a lot of work before it is deemed play-able by the public. So far now, now that I got it finally working on my computer, it isn't half bad.However, one gripe I have with this game is optimization. I'm running it on my 3 year old potato laptop, and I had to put all settings on low at 720p. Maybe I just need to get my gaming rig completed.Track randomization is not bad at all. There was the occasional expirience where the track didn't load right, and left holes in the map and walls on the track itself blocking me from completing a lap. I would like to see options and sliders for track randomization, like complexity, length, height changes, and other variables.Car handling is not that bad, altough it does need some touch-ups before launch.All in all, not bad in Early Development, it just needs a bit more work done to it to make it able to play it for the consumer. And for the love of everyone around here, add AI racing. I've delt with Victory and not being able to play with other racers. Keep this game from becoming a ghost town with optional AI racing locally.7/10 Great concept, great layout, needs some polish.			"

Early Access Review
								Interesting premise, seems like some great tech behind it. Been following the development of Racecraft since it started, and got in on the closed beta early on.Pros: -Great track generation system, they may all look similar but the procedural nature keeps things fresh.-Graphics seem pretty clean and slick.-Download size is nice and small, which is a nice change for modern racing games.Cons: -Performance is pretty poor. My system can handle most games on medium-high with 60fps. With Racecraft I get 25fps in the menus, 10-15fps when on track-Menu is absolute garbage. Reminds me of a console game ported to PC, circa 2005. Mouse is completely unusable and controls for navigating around are weird.-Lack of vehicle choice. Yes I get it's early access alpha, but despite the screenshots showing multiple cars, you can only drive one red one. -Painful car setup options. It's done whilst you're on track by pressing left alt, then tapping right alt to select the option, then holding right alt until your tweaks are just right. I've never seen such poorly implemented UI decisions.-AI cars are very floaty, they tend to drift over the track and never really have any feeling of being out there with TL;DR If you can buy it cheap, then get it, otherwise hold off on this one. It has a good concept but the execution at this stage of the early access is not enough to warrant a $19.99 price tag.			"

								ENG:As Victory: The Age of Racing game, this is a very good and functional racing car game in which the main focus is mostly a multiplayer game.The game is visually like many other really beautiful and functional physics.The game has excellent maneuverability and a lot of driving assistance also for novice players.The interface is clear but, yet tricky to use, because it can not be used with the mouse.In contrast to the Victory: The Age of Racing, this also offers finally a solo player. There is an almost endless range of different tracks that can be played at this time also one of the driver against the artificial intelligence. Formula selection of cars is not like the one available at the moment.However, this is becoming a very promising and effective basic formula car game, a testimonial!FIN:Kuten Victory: The Age of Racing peli, tämä on varsin hyvä ja toimiva kilpa-auto peli, jonka pääpaino on lähinnä moninpelissä.Peli on visuaalisesti kuten monet muutkin todella kaunis ja fysiikalta toimiva. Pelissä on erinomainen ajettavuus ja paljon ajoa avustavia apuja myös aloitteleville pelaajille.Käyttöliittymä on selkeä mutta, hankala vielä käyttää, koska sitä ei voi käyttää hiirellä.Toisin kuin Victory: The Age of Racing, tämä tarjoaa vihdoinkin myös jotakin yksin pelaajalle. Tarjolla on lähes loputtomasti erillaisia ratoja joita voi pelata tällä hetkellä myös yhtä tekoäly ajajaa vastaan. Formula auto valikoimaa ei ole kuin yksi tarjolla tällä hetkellä.Tästä on kuitenkin tulossa varsin lupaava ja toimivan perus formula autopeli, suositteluni!			"

								This is my first review after one race.i am a big fan of LFS - life for speed. This game has been my favourite racing simulation for years. Comparing Racecraft to LFS, Racecraft needs the following improvements:- setup of the car should be changeable- sound of the car can be improved to be more realistic- a serious damage model needs to be implemented- single player with more opponents- multiplayer with some sort of leaderboard or similar.But this are things that still ned to be implemented.Now I come to the apparent pros and cons of the game + relatively easy to drive the car + till now i could not detect any lagging - even with fullest graphics settings (on a GeForce GTX 970) -  car tends to drift a lot - but with a realistic setup of the car this could be minimized -  controller setup needs to be redone. my logitech gamepad was regognized but i couldnt calibrate it. + game didnt crash in the first run.Improvements that should be done to the unique gameplay: -the race track generator should be customizable (e.g. length of straights, number of turns, sharpness of turns,   elevations and so on) - Better calibration of the game controllers and even the keyboard calibration could be tweaked a bit - Mouse control in the menues is essential.in the current early access state of the game i would give 4 of 10 points.

								Feels great so far and the game does have a really cool concept. The ""endless"" content will unfortunately be its achiles heel if they don't put in some more stuff to do. Racing on randomized tracks is awesome, but unless you are a die hard fan of F1 racing games, this will get boring after a while.Also... I may not be a great driver, but god damn this game is picky! Very few of my laps actually counted as valid because if you make the slightest mistake like touching the wall or curb, it's invalid. It's not like it's cheating, you know?(I got this for free by owning Victory, which I thought was a pretty crappy game. This however feels a lot better in comparison)			"

Early Access Review
Edit (Dec 24 2016): Nothing has changed since my original review. The game is still extremely laggy, there is still no mouse control in the menus, all menus are still locked behind the procedural track generator... none of these have improved whatsoever. In fact, playing the game from a fresh install on my new computer corrupted Steam and forced me to reinstall it and restart my computer to get everything working again.Racecraft is still nowhere near being a playable game worth anyone's time or money.---------Original:We need to start this off with a warning. The developers of Racecraft, Vae Victus, have only done one other Steam game, Victory: The Age of Racing. They abandoned the game for two years, then made it free-to-play and have still yet to update it in any way. This studio's track record is small but horrible, so please bear that in mind.Racecraft is designed to be a procedurally-generated driving game, its gameplay being based in simulation with some arcade modifications to it. It was a formula that worked fairly well in Victory, and it's been refined here in Racecraft. Driving feels tight yet fluid enough so that it doesn't feel stiff, and the sense of speed is there. When it comes down to the core gameplay, Racecraft has got many of the checkboxes marked. My biggest concern with one of the previous versions in the closed Alpha was that there were a lot of symbols and signs on the track that I couldn't identify. My racing history is mostly in Need for Speed - I'm not a racing sim gamer - so it would have been helpful to have some explanation on what the track signs meant.Outside of gameplay design, Racecraft falls short of being a stable game to play in. Again, keep in mind that this is still Early Access, so things are bound to be, well, Early Access. But there's a myriad of issues present in the current version. 1) The game just crashed on me while I was preparing to write this review. 2) The menus are extremely slow to respond, slow to animate, and do not have mouse control (as a game releasing on Steam in 2016, that last part shouldn't even be there). 3) The game's menus are locked behind the procedural track generator, so you'll be waiting a while before you can even change the game from fullscreen or turning off its effects or what have you. 4) Gameplay itself is incredibly sluggish, even when I turn off all effects, get out of fullscreen, and lower the resolution.There also seems to be some sort of issue with controller support. Sometimes it recognizes my Logitech Wireless Gamepad F710, sometimes it doesn't. For the record, Racecraft will fully support wheels (if it doesn't already), so if you have one of those peripherals you're in luck here. It should also be stated that Racecraft requires DirectX 11 or newer, so if you're running DirectX 10 or older (which millions of Steam accounts still are), you won't be able to play Racecraft.Because of the many issues with the game, I cannot recommend Racecraft in its current state. I look forward to future updates, and as I stated in my disclaimer I will update this review as such, but for now I advise staying away.			"

Early Access Review
								Overall, the game is looking good for an early access release. However, there are several irksome issue which need to be addressed soon in order to keep the game working at a playable and enjoyable level. The main issue is controller support, which at the moment seems to have actually gone backwards. I use an Xbox One controller and the callibration always freezes when trying to calibrate the brake setting, meaning I can not, ultimately, even set my controls how I want them, IE; not using Y to change gear etc. Alongside this, the menu and UI is incredibly slow and irritating to navigate, especially when driving on the track. Positives from the game so far, however, are that the graphics and sound are coming along quite nicely, the track tips are excellent, without giving too much away and enough to allow you to learn tracks quickly. Livery customisation has been added, which is a good start, and the random track generation is brilliant fun. All in all, a 3.5 stars so far, as it is clear a lot of work still needs to be done, but well worth picking up.			"

								Well, first thing's first, right now there isn't much content. This game only has hotlaps and race against A.I. which does tend to get boring. However, graphics are quite nice and gameplay is real smooth. Controls work well for the keyboard, but I gave up trying to calibrate my controller because callibration thing was dodgy and really hard to understand for me, though I think that's more of a personal thing. While I don't particularly dislike this game, I would say just hold off for a little while and wait until a few issues are fixed and more content is available. If you can get it cheap, go for it.Pros:- Great graphics- Quite realistic- Has a lot of potentialCons:- Not many gamemodes- Gets boring after a while- (?) Controller Callibration is dodgy. - Developers have bit of negative reputation.TL;DRDon't buy yet, wait for fixes and more content.			"

There is some nice tech there.  So they are off to a good start with this one.The potential is there for an outstanding game if the developers carry it through this time.So I'd leave it a while and see how it develops, or buy it if you are happy taking a risk on an Early Access getting finished and delivering as promised.

Early Access Review
								This game in its current state, claims that they are ""80% done with physics"". Well the physics are not that great, so if you're 80% done with them, I don't see much improvement. Seriously, drifting in a F1 car? That and bots not being able to be hit along with no damage, takes away a lot of the racing aspect of racecraft. The track length is also a little on the short side, and a lot of the features are repetitive. I may look again once its out of early access. However , I do see a lot of room for improvement here, so I will actually change my review to positive.			"

Early Access Review
								Not as good as expected.  Had issues using the Steam controller and basic ol' xbox 360 controller.  Devs tried to help at 1st but seemed to have given up on the controller support. This didnt work with the 2 racing wheels ive tried. But before 1 of the updates that made the controller support all messed up, i had a chance to play.  The track creation seemed randomly generated. The tracks seemed to be varents of the same track. The psychics were ok.  The graphics were very nice.   The car settjgs were basic and you couldnt upgrade your car.  At this point i cant recomend it. Maybe at  a lower price.  But still nothing was thrilling about this game compared to other racing games.			"

								i would recomend this game. however it wont work on my computer, some times i make it tp the menu but most of the time it alltogether fails to open. the gameplay is very lacking AI cars that you can just drive right threw and a very serious lack of cusomisation leaves me wanting more out of this game, as it is right now all racecraft has going for it is time attack raceing and thats it, i would♥♥♥♥♥more but i just litterly can not play this game at all hoewver it did works about 4 updaites ago.

								Ok thought I would do a new updated review. The game now looks a lot  better. It also seems to run better. The game still lacks a multiplayer option. So thats a big negative to me. Pick almost any racing game and they all have multiplayer option. I know this game is in EA but multiplayer would make this game  worth the money. Right now its just hotlaps around a track. If that appeals to you then this game might be your type of game. It does have unlimited tracks and they do look a lot better then before. They have even put people in the stands. A nice touch. The tracks are now more detailed looking. Sadly career is still not working. Again just hot laps around a track. The trouble I have with the game is thats its just not compelling enough. For the regular asking price of $20 you get a hot lap game with unlimited amount of tracks and some modifications you can make to your car and thats it. No career no multiplayer as of yet. I should add the handeling felt good on my xbox360 controller. Its slightly arcadish for anyone wondering what the physics felt like. The competition is rough for this type of game. Rocket League is the same price as this game. I get that its not an exact copy of this game however that game does offer online mutliplayer. Spend just another $10 dollars and you could own Project Cars. Its in a very saturated market. To me right now it just doesnt stand out much. Thats not to say I am never going to change my mind on this game. Every time a new update comes out I play the game to see what things they have changed. I also wish people would stop down voting opinions because they dont like them.  I suppose if I made a glowing review of this game it would be higher. Perhaps in the future. However for now my review still stands at a no I dont recommend this game right now. I would also like to add the developers of this game are very cool people. Who do seem to care about their game.

								Menus is keyboard only, game needs a lot more polish, the car craft isnt in yet, wait...just wait a long time...or get windows 10 and forza 6 & forza horizon 3.  Just suffer the pain of not having a fun ""build ur own car"" sim or arcade racer... or deal with origin and NFS there.  I'll keep dreaming of a good racer with ""build ur own car"" hm..wreckfest anyone?			"

								I played the techdemo and loved it.This is even better.I am very suprised that more people haven't picked this up; it's a great racing game which requires skill and braveness; you've got to conquer each corner of a track which the game has beautifully designed to test your nerve and it works every time.Give it a try! I demand ye.			"

								A promising-looking Early Access title. I'd argue that if you just enjoy having a variety of tracks to try your hand at driving, the initial outlay currently provides you with a functional product that you can have a lot of fun with. Here's hoping that development continues and that we wend up with the full featureset.
