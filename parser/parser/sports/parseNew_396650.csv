Early Access Review
								Do I recommend it, even though this is only the first episode? Yes I do.The scores below are from 1 to 10, 1 being terrible, 5 being average and 10 being excellent. I am confident in this Visual Novel and I think it can be one of the best Western Visual Novels. Keep in mind that the scale I am using is the same that I use to evaluate japanese visual novels (like Grisaia no Kajitsu):Story: Not rated at the moment (episode 1)Since this is only the first episode and was pretty much about introductions (and there's still another girl to be introduced in the next episode), I can't rate the story. My personal thoughts are that this is going to be a straightforward comedy slice of life romantic visual novel, so I don't expect any serious developments or mind blows.There's not really much I can say about writing. It focuses on the dialogue and the protag thoughts, and doesn't waste time in detailing objects/sceneries. It's an easy to read writing and direct to the point.There are some references and easter eggs. One of the best scenes in this visual novel is a small battle between the MC, Kaori and a Tech Gosu. Their battle is a little parody between Android, Apple and Microsoft. Another is when choosing a movie, you get to choose a movie of a list of movies that all are based off real movies, and the characters leave their comment on it.Visuals: 7The backgrounds are just too good. The artist makes such a good job of using lightning to give more life to the backgrounds.The characters also look good in my opinion. The big drawback here is that, probably due to financial limits, secondary characters don't have fully drawn sprites. Meaning that their sprites are just black figures.Gameplay: 9This visual novel, just like many others, is about making choices. Difference is that this one has tons of choices that drastically change the story, while the others only have a few. If you need a comparison, compare it to Walking Dead videogame from Telltalles games. Some choices only change a few lines, while others change a lot of what happens. For example, earlier in the game, you can choose to go to school by bus or with the bike. Depending on what you choose, it will change what characters you meet first and what will happen in the next day. Not only that, but if you decide to be an A hole with someone, that someone will remember it later and act accordingly.There's also the rollback feature. Rollback is the feature that allows you to rollback to your previous choice and choose another option. In this VN, you are asked in the begginning if you want to disable it. If you do, you will get achievements and ""other possible goodies"".You can also name your protagonist and choose his background trait: athletic, intelligent and intuitive. If you choose to be athletic, you will have no problem carrying luggage, if you choose to be intelligent, other characters might ask for your help with the studies, etc. This also sometimes highlights the best options in some choices, for example, if the teacher asks a question, the correct answer will be highlighted if you chose the intelligent trait.This visual novel also features mini games. In the first episode, there are two type of mini games, if there will be more or not in the future I don't know. One is a simple press the right combination of 5 buttons scattered around the screen. In this episode, it appears only once to callibrate the MC's mech. To be honest that minigame feels unnecessary (especially because your penalty for failing is just repeating the mini game), however one of the devs said that he plans to use it again later, so I assume that this one can serve as a tutorial kind of thing.The other mini game is the combat. I am pleased that they improved it a lot since the alpha. Now it's a lot better and it feels like I am actually doing some damage. This mini game is simple: Just press WASD according to what appears on the screen. If it appears W, press W and your combo will go up. You have limited energy and the enemy has HP. Depending on how well you do in the combat, the other characters will react to it (if you did well, they will praise you, etc). However, the bad side is that the mini game is too easy (for me at least).Sound: 7They really did a good job here. The music is good and one of the tracks even got stuck in my ear (it's one that plays when riding the bike if we choose to go to school with it). That's a lot more than I can say for many visual novels. You see, I am like this: if I like the music that is playing, I continue to play the VN with it on, if I don't, I turn off the music and play my own. I didn't turn off the music in this VN.The voice acting is also good. The voices match very well with the characters (Shou especially). Obviously, we are talking about low budget voice acting, so don't expect voice acting on Morgan Freeman level (aka God level). It's good, but not something that will blow you away. But considering that one can count english voice acted visual novels with just one hand, this is a really good effort from the devs.However, there are at least two moments where secondary characters don't have voice. Considering that I reported this in the last alpha, I am going to assume that their lack of voice is intentional and not a bug. This is weird because everyone else is voiced. I will update this if they add voices later.Characters: Not going to rate yetSome of the characters are inspired by your usual japanese anime stereotypes, like tsundere. However, they don't shamessly try to imitate them to the letter, which is good, because english voice acting + japanese stereotypes = usually not a good idea. It's not by chance that ""Idiot!"" doesn't sound as good as ""baka!"" at the end of ""I didn't do it because I like you, baka!""In the first episode, you are introduced to an uncle (Kaito), sister (Nikki), friend (Shou) and the romantic options: Mayu, Yuuna and Kaori. There's also a french girl appearing in the next episode, Belle (Ooh là là). And there's also other guy that you may or may not meet in this episode depending on your choices, Akira (I got my eye on you, you white haired *insert swear here*)Because we are only in the first episode, and also because I'm lazy, I will refrain for now from talking of each one individually, but what I can say is that they feel compeling and I want to know more about them.Enjoyment: 9I am a sucker for choices. I am a sucker for consequences. So I had a blast replaying it multiple times and roleplay differently each time.The only complaint I have is that this episode felt a bit shorter compared with the original demo, but other than that, it was fun.Final rating: 8 (episode 1)TL;DR:Just buy it! I kid. You should buy it if:- You like light hearted stories;- You like mechas;- You like tons of choices;- You like easter eggs/references;- You want to support western VN's.You shouldn't buy it if:- You want a serious story (again, this is based off of the first episode, it might get serious moments later on for all I know);- You don't like any kind of mini games in visual novels;- You prefer more linear stories.If you have any questions or you want to point out something, feel free to comment. I will reply as soon I notice it.			"

												Wow. So, this one came in as a complete surprise. I didnt expect much when i bought it, but boy was I wrong.TL;DR:Pros:  Intriguing Story  Good, genuinly funny writing  Tons of choices, that also have an impact  Unique and likeable characters  Fully voice-acted  Decent length  Nice Artstyle & SoundtrackCons:  Abrupt, unsatisfying ending  Minor: Artwork occasionally gets re-usedIn Detail:Pixelfade. Never heard of that Developer before, nor about the game itself. So I expected a pretty run-of-the-mill Visual Novel...This was not what I got. The CharactersThe character cast in ACE Academy was great across the board for me. The romancable characters are unique and differ heavily from each other, but all of them are very likeable.Other characters such as your best friend, or your little sister etc. are just as loveable. The Dynamic between them is great and the game manages to convey a real sense of belonging. You feel like a real part of the group. The StoryThe Story is what I would probably classify as mildly interesting. That doesnt mean it's bad, far from it. For a VN it's actually rather intriguing and does the job well enough. It's nothing revolutionary, but compared to a lot of other VN I would say it is above average. RomancesNow as mentioned before there are 4 romancable characters.Each of them has unique traits but all of them have very rewarding and heartwarming moments in their respective routes.Through the excellent writing the progression of these romantic relationships also feels pretty natural and not forced. Game Length & Choices After doing all the routes I capped at roughly 20 hours. Now, I will not lie, I didnt really check my playtime after I first reached the ending , but it should last you a good 10 hours.However that is only if you play through it once, there are a lot of reason to play through it several times.At the start of the game you name your MC and select 1 out of 3 personality types. Depending on your type you will get unique dialogue choices as well as different outcomes in some events.In additon to that you also have the above mentioned different romances that I encourage you to explore.Lastly this game throws a ton of choices at you from the get go. Some may just slightly alter a dialogue, but there are also a lot that affect the story and that have actual impact.One important thing that I'd like to mention here is, that you also have the choice to be a total♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ You may end up alone doing so, but hey - you can!The Ending  (Spoilerfree)Without revealing too much - The ending is very sudden. I expected at least 1 or 2 hours more before reaching it.Alas the story came to a ""close"" pretty quickly. Now I say ""close"" because it is somewhat of an open ending. That's the only real gripe I have with it.Overall:It's funny, has great characters and gives the player a lot of choice, but the ending is a bit of a letdown.I'd say if you have an interest in VN this game is worth full-price. On a sale I would lable it as a must-have without hesitation.Kaori is best girl!About the Developer:I do want to take a minute to write about the developer. As mentioned above, I didn't know about them before.But because the game was so enjoyable I checked them out a bit (mostly to see if and when part 2 is coming out) and I was very pleasently surprised.Originally only 2 romancable characters were planned. 1 more was added before the Kickstarter stretchgoal was reached and another one was changed to also be romancable due to popular demand.I also checked out a dev stream they hosted and they seemed genuinly passionate about what they were doing.I'm writing this for 2 reasons; I like what I found out about them. Listening to customer feedback is really important in my opinion and that is what they are doing. I dig that, and I want them to be successfull. The ACE universe is much bigger than what is in the first game. But currently there are no plans for a Sequel. That's a nono! I want them to get more money and make the sequel happen! Do it! "

												If you ever wanted a visual novel where you can troll the hell out of everyone in it, look no further. ACE Academy is a western VN with a lot of humor and English voice acting (that manages to not be terrible). I have to be honest, the first playthrough I wasn't that impressed. I chose the sensible, serious dialog options and found it to be an average slice-of-life story with a pretty disappointing ending.Then for the next playthrough I went full-on troll mode and it got way better. Humor is the biggest reason you should pick up ACE Academy. It had me laughing out loud many times, and that's enough to forgive it for its flaws (lackluster ending, some unvoiced dialog, minor characters are represented by silhouettes, etc.).In summary, there is a dialog choice that says ""Swiggity swooty, I'm coming for that booty."" I think that says it all.			"

Early Access Review
								Firstly I’d just like to say as this is the early access and still has a lot more to come I thought it was extremely good. The story was enticing and kept me very interested in the characters throughout the first part of the game. I also enjoyed little mini games within this visual novel which kept things interesting. Secondly the music to this game is very good and fits the rhythm of what is happening and the mood that goes with it. I was very surprised at how well it was done for a company’s first work.Finally all the characters to this game have a lot to them and are all very likeable. This made me enjoy the story so much more and felt more connected with each character. The voice acting is also good and fits the characters all very well giving them all their own great personalities. There are also many different choices you can make which help keep the game fresh and mean there is much more replay ability. In all I feel ACE Academy is definitely worth a buy! It’s a lot better than most other visual novels I have played on steam. Especially seeing as the first part is longer than most of them, it is defiantly worth the money! If visual novels are your thing I think you will enjoy it as much or maybe more than I did! "

Early Access Review
								As one of the earliest and largest supporters of the project, back when it was known as ‘Kendo Crush’, I have to say, that I had a great deal of fun with the original demo. However, I have since given up support for the project, through no reason other than the unfortunate issues the development staff encountered at many steps. What was originally intended to come out fully in June of this year, is now still in early access.However, this is to be expected. They have changed the game considerably, and picked up new staff, despite the issues encountered. As a mid-tier backer of the project, I was given early access to builds of the new ‘Ace Academy’ game. All I can say is I found the quality of the writing to be greatly diminished from that of the original demo. Without spoiling anything, certain character interactions with a girl named ‘Kaori’. She’s quite temperamental, and I was originally satisfied with how much you were able to tease her. From what I played of the current game, there have been far less options to do this. In general, I found the comedy of the original to be much more prominent. There are some improvements over the redo. The art is much better, and I’m sure the futuristic appeal of the game will be more enjoyable to some, over the original Kendo focus, which some might have seen as boring. I must admit, that it was probably a better move for the game to be redesigned, but that doesn’t change my opinion on the matter.While I can guarantee the game is worth the price, it just isn’t there for me.

												So I was looking for Visual Novels on Steam which are on sale (Everyone wants sales) then I came across this VN. I didn't deem it as something good because it was on sale and probably because I never heard of it before add to that it was made in the west. So my expectations were set to low and I played the game to basically laugh at how terrible it might be. Then it happened 2 hours in and I can't get the game off of my mind. The characters are too damn good, the interactions are superb, there are a plethora of choices and scenarios to see and of course the protagonist is realistic. I'm not a fan of Mech and the future but this is an exception. An exceptionaly, wonderful VN for those lost in the dangerous seas that is called VN hell. I finally found something I'd read 'til the end. Simply amazing, no amount of praise can amount to the light I saw yesterday.			"

Early Access Review
								Literally one of the best VN’s ive ever played.  The voice acting is done VERY well, high quality, everyone is voiced except for the protagonist even side/background characters. This game proves that English voice acting can absolutely work despite in VNs despite the highbrow subtitle snobs POV insisting on Japanese subtitles! Pacing is great, lots of choices that seem to matter, interesting characters, very cool anime slice of lifeish plot, mecha… I mean ya its got everything.I could try to explain why this game rocks, but honestly, the easiest way I can say that this game has earned its very positive rating is that…. I basically got the game for free way back when it was offered in beta.  And I just went and bought the game in the store even though I own it already.  This game is well worth the price, if your any kinda anime nerd snatch it up.			"

								Great VN! One of the greatest VN on steam, devs put many nice jokes and references, many (and i mean MANY!) dialog choices, but those choices make no big difference. Basically those choices help you create your own personality of mc. And there's 3 types of ""specializations"" which gives you different choices in some dialogs.pros:+Nice art+Many choices in dialogs+Somehow, it feels fresh (maybe just for me)+3 types of ""specializations""+Humor+""YOLO!"" (you'll know what i mean)+Standart, but not annoying types of girls (I liked even tsundere (I HATE TSUNDERE!))+In some dialogs, you must react fast, and pick the right choise before time ends+-It feels like incest is will be an option later on (personaly, I like that) (confirmed by devs!)+-Obvious route choicescons:+-Obvious route choices+-It feels like incest is will be an option later on.

								After playing through this game, I can't help but be excited for the following Chapters. The story has grabbed me and I don't think It will let go. The characters all have unique personalities, none of the main cast was ever flat or boring. The subtle and not so subtle jokes are always well used and give a nice depth.I'm a sucker for well made characters, and everything about the cast is perfect in my opinion.. From the art to the voice acting. Each character is brought to life, I can't wait to see them grow.  "

								I had my eye on this one for a while but as always when it came to Early Access games, I was little wary, but a sale convinced me to invest in this little gem, and in hindsight the full price would have totally been worth it now that I have spent some time playing it. The artwork is beautiful, there is actual English voice acting which is pretty rare among VNs, the music does an excellent job of setting the mood for scenes, and there are plenty of choices to make unlike some of the others out there. Overall what I've played has been good thus far, and I look forward to seeing what the devs add in the future.			"

								Great VN one of the few good ones on steam, tho its still unfinished at the momment.

								This is a really good first look at what this game will give us in the future, I'm not going to lie I was really hesitant to even buy this due to the changes that it went through in development such as the name change from Kendo Crush to ACE Academy and the genre change from a modern day high school and a 3rd person perspective to a futurisitic high school in a 1st person perspective but I'm glad that I bought this as it is really entertaining.I really like the characters personalities, voice acting and design, the story is fun to read through with all the different references stuck in throughout to show the comedy and the conversations the other characters have such as Shou and Kaori's arguements. The battles are simpistic but fun and, for me personally, were panic enducing wondering what button will show up next. After saying all this I have to say once again that this experience was (and hopefully will continue to be when the other episodes get released) enjoyable.			"

												A Western Visual novel by a new indie-developers,there aren't any ""special CG's"" in this game if thats the kind of VN you're looking for, however it certainly doesn't lack lewd jokes.Pros : + Great writing with plenty of humor+ Interesting characters with fun interactions+ Proper meme usage+ Modern visual novel interface+ No limit on save files (I cleared the game with 307 slots used)+ Convincing world-building+ Has Valerie+ Music is appropriate+ Full voice acting+ Adult humour + You get the options to say some really amusing stupid things and/or be a jerkSomewhere inbetween :~ Some options don't really change anything,thankfully you can mouse wheel up/load saves to see all the flavor text.~ ""Quick-time"" options spice things up once in a while,not used often enough to really become annoying.~ Story is decent at best but the character interactions and dialouge choices sorta make up for it.Cons :- Still relatively short,despite already being longer than planned- Not entirely satisfying ending, hopefully it gets the proper ending it deserves in a sequel.- Lots of re-used backgrounds, unsurprising for the first project of a new dev team.- Shou is not romanceable- $20 price tag for a 10~ hour game.Main character roster includes :> Fun bruh to hang out with (second best character)> Cranky tsundere girl> Meek book girl> Goody two shoes girl> Hot as♥♥♥♥♥♥french engineer girl (best girl)> Cute imouto> Super cool uncleGame lasts about 8~12 hours on a regular playthrough,which is a little disappointing considering its $20 pricetag but the quality of those hours make it so very worth it.The game is genuinely amusing at times and there are plenty of ridiculous scenarios where I often find myself grinning like an idiot as I ponder over dialogue choices. The character interaction is probably the biggest drawing point for me.			"

												This VN is out for earning spot in VN's Top 10 of all time. It had all the tools to be great and it has used those properly. This game is awesome. It even made me write my first review after being on steam for several years and playing tons of games. For those, who don't get its superiority, I will list the best sided of it:- voice acting - none of the voices feels out of place, they suit characters really well and make it wonderful experience;- character - they are just amazing. You can find the cliches if you are hunting for them. But that just means you are being stupid. This game has the perfect development of the character which is all based on your choices... which are MANY!- choices are everywhere. You can be total jerk. You can be the nicest person on earth. You can be whoever you want and the world will React hillariously!- all those little things - where else will you find a VN that lets you customize the main character's personality. Where else would you find so many off-route dialogs, memes, real life references. - no hentai, no perverted stuff. It is a BIG plus. Most of the games, who fall for the 18+ stuff lose a lot in plot and the characters. There can be no romance and intrigue if all you are waiting for at one point becomes some more boobs (and boops). I recall the humor and the plot from Rance e.g., but when you compare, it all becomes way more funnies and pure when no perverted stuff is involved.- the story. It is not that big and complex. And it leaves an open ending. But it is real. You can imagine such things happenning in the real life. And that's as awesome as rare for any VN,- Yuuno. I just love her.- developers. They are just awesome. They care. I wish I could work with those guys.10/10 - Highly Recommendedbest novel of all time (until Crystaline comes out, probably)			"

												ACE Academy quickly became one of my favorite Visual Novel in steam. It has everything I'm looking for in a VN. Great Story, Fun and Interesting Characters, Lots of choices to help shape your character, different paths you can take, and a good romance system for the female characters you will be meeting. All the character are fully voice acted and all of them sound great, the girls that you will be dating are very varied in personality and all of them have interesting background you will get to learn if you decide to date one of them. The artworks looks beautiful and cool, same goes with the character design, the soundtrack is solid considering I never get bored of hearing them and some of them are even heart warming.I highly recommend picking this up if it ever goes on sale and I'll guarantee you will have lots of fun! ^-^			"

								Despite being in early access, this is one of the best visual novels out in the Steam. Why, you ask? Well, let me break it down for you: This game can be compared to an ANIME TELLTALE'S GAMES, because of the numerous dialogue choices you can make during the course of the story, which is really neat because you can choose either you want to be a smooth gentleman, a cliché harem protagonist or a magnificent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Because of this game format, every playthrough seems unique, something rare in the visual novel genre.I strongly recommend buying this game. It has everything: A good story, lot of funny references, a nice protagonist and an extremely good artwork!			"

												So, ACE Academy has finally been released. I'm happy to tell anyone who's reading my little review that it has definitely realized the potential of what it could be, and I can absolutely recommend it!Story:The story is nice. It doesn't follow many conventions you would see elsewhere in the genre. You play as a foreign exchange student from New York, moving into the Mech Pilot program at ACE Academy. There's some drama and intrigue, but it's mostly slice of life goodness. All of the characters are executed very well, and they come off as very original. The individual routes are sweet, and the worst points of the story fall straight to mediocrity instead of actually being bad.It has lots of good humor in it too, and references to other games and media are a plenty. Maybe someday, if you wish hard enough, Ceonardo Di Laprio will win the Moscars. Maybe someday...Music:Very nice. None of the tracks get boring to listen to, but they aren't particularly super memorable either. That works well for the title though, and they all accentuate the scenes they're in well. Kudos to the composer!Voice Acting:This is really one of the defining features of ACE Academy. it's a western visual novel that has full voice acting, and not only that: It's good! Really good! Special mentions go to Nikki's VA, Yuuna's VA (Who got better as development progressed! She did an excellent job.), Shou's VA, and Yuri's VA because Yuri is a russian character and that's cool. Everyone else did a great job as well. Kudos, guys!Art:The art in this game is just wonderful. I love the style, and althought it sometimes varies a bit it's all wonderful. The character art is really good in particular, and the variety of different clothes the characters wear throughout the game did not go unnoticed. Really, it's insane just how much variety there is! I think that Yuuna has around 9 different clothing styles or something. It's nuts, and pretty much all the characters are like that. Really excellent choice, and I'm very pleased that it was made.The background art isn't really anything to gush about, but it's good as well. You'll notice that some Background art gets recycled, but for the price of this title it's understandable. Gameplay:Gameplay, you might say? This is a Visual Novel! Why is there a section about gameplay?Well, this part of my review exists solely for me to praise the decision to remove gameplay.If you hadn't played Ace Academy before the final release, you wouldn't have known that originally it had QTE gameplay and the skeleton of an RPG equipment system. It's better that way too, since the glory of ACE Academy is and was it's characters and story. Good job, PixelFade Studio! The decision to cut the gameplay was smart, and the game is better without it.Final Verdict:Buy this game. It's excellent. If you've played any Visual Novels and liked them, this game is for you. The closest analogue to this game I can think of is Sunrider Academy. I'm happy to tell all of you that have played that game that ACE Academy throws it to the ground and smacks it around when it comes to quality: and sunrider was no slouch, either!I'm very hopeful that PixelFade Studio will release another visual novel. Which they basically say they'll be doing in the post credits blurb. I'll be keeping my eyes open for the next title! I bought this game once for myself, and another time for a friend. I'll probably be buying it again for someone else! It's that good and you've set a standard for quality.'Other Thoughts:There are some interesting artifacts still left inside ACE Academy. They don't diminish from the experience, but are just kind of funny overall. For example, selecting your main characteristic. It's completely useless! LOL. But you should smart mang like me, and choose Intelligent because it's da best characteristic. Also, on a very rare occasion there will be a voice line missing. I've also noticed at least once that a voice was attached to the wrong line. There are probably a few kinks like these to work out, but I'm sure this game will get a 1.1 patch at some point smoothing out any remaining QA issues. Like I said, they don't take away from the experience. In fact, I've found them to be charming! This was a herculian task for the team that made it, and was their first project for what I can tell.

Early Access Review
								For my first ever VN I was a little skeptical if I would enjoy these types of games, though I do watch anime. But with the awesome art, great voicing and music masterpieces I was fully immersed into the atmosphere of the VN and was enjoying the comedy as well as the drama that unfolded during the episodes.The character development so far has been great and has made me make some hard decisions in relationships between me and the other characters. I'm going for Kaori :D It was a tough decision between her and Yuuna, sorry all you Yuuna fans.With that intergration of quick time events during the action of the VN and quick second decisions, it keeps you on your toes and puts a creative twist of VNs I haven't seen before making it an enjoyable experience the whole way through.I could go on and on but i'll cut it short and say, if you have never played a VN before and see this masterpiece I strongly recommend you buy this one, you will never look back and wonder why you bought it.It is keeping me on edge as I powered through the first 2 episodes in one session and I want more already. 10/10 :D "

								Don't let the ""hours played"" fool you. I have finished the ACE Academy story TWICE and about to go through it a third time. It is remarkable, lovable, hilarious, feels worthy, and much more! The voice acting is in english, which I was reluctant at first because the only VNs I have read were with japanese voices (Sorry, I'm not talking about ♥♥♥♥♥♥ nekopara), such as Clannad and others. These english VAs (Voice Actors) were fantastic!! Characters were on point, the different routes you can do to obtain them ""affection"" points~. Just overall amazing and can't wait for episode 4!!

								THIS REVIEW IS ONLY EARLY ACESS VIDEO SO SCORE'S WILL PROBABLY BE HIGHER!First off: Story. Story is nice, it goes nice pace, and there is a lot choices. Even if story is 2049, giant mechas etc, story is realistic and heart warming. This is keeping up with If My Heart Had Wings, which I think is best visual novel on Steam so far. I might gives this even more credits, but because Early Access, I don't want to rush, but if story is written as well as first 2 episodes, my god they should nearly make anime or movie about this.Art is awesome. People look good, backrounds are realistic and nice. Big bonus is that eyes moves, which makes characters realistic and some what interacticve. I just wish they could use E-mote so whole character could move. That would make even more realistic. About music, it's good. there are few songs what I hear again and again, but they are not too bad. Sountracks know their place, but few more songs would be nice. Voice acting... This is were ACE Academy shines like a diamond. Voices are so believable. Voice actors really capture their characters personality. This is maybe the main reason why you should buy this.For those who needs score: 8/10I really like to give higher score but since it's early access, I don't want to rush. But what can I say so far.... BUY IT! Even for the full price, this is Diamond. You DON'T WANT TO MISS THIS! It's funny, awesome, interactive and heart melting.			"

								Although it's still in Early Access, ACE Academy is shaping up to be a great Visual Novel with a ton of potential. As in most Visual Novels, you can of course choose how you react and respond to other characters and situations. However, ACE Academy includes certain features that go a step beyond other games in the genre. The main character can be named, and you can choose a ""specialty"" for him, such as athletic, intelligent, or charismatic. These affect events in the game. You can also choose which weapons you load on your Mecha (AKA GEAR), which actually affect your GEAR's statistics. These minor features add up to a better experience and a more content-rich game.The characters are fun and entertaining. Most of them seem to settle in to standard anime roles, but they may surprise you. On the Romance side of things you have ""Tsundere Girl"" Kaori, ""Nice Girl"" Yuuna, ""Shy Girl"" Mayu, and ""Refreshingly Horny Girl"" Valerie. They are not one-note characters, and even Kaori's hostility is more than just anger for anger's sake. For the Supporting Cast you have ""Best Little Sister Ever"" Nikki, ""Best Uncle Ever"" Kaito, and ""Broseph"" Shou. Unlike most stories with a Harem setup, ACE Academy's supporting characters are vital to the story and have just as much characterization as the main girls. I see it as one of the game's unique strengths.There are currently two chapters in Early Access, and it's a nice amount of content especially with the game's branches and reactivity. If nothing else, it should be more than enough to tell whether you will love the game or not.I highly recommend ACE Academy. It is actually the first game I even bothered to post a review for. If you are reluctant to enter Early Access on principle, I would still recommend Bookmarking the game so you know when it's released. If you love Visual Novels, Dating Sims, or any kind of game with Choices and Consequences, I believe you'll have a lot of fun.			"

								Very rarely do I actually give games reviews. This is probably one of the best games I have played. Despite it being based into the future, the choices give me options that I personally would say/do, allowing me to feel like I am actually part of the game itself. The fact that it allows you to name your own character and gives you a few choices to customize or alter the character at the beginning is even better. In my opinion, with all the work and effort put into it, definitely worth the price!			"

												Ace Academy is a true gem in the genre of visual novels. I haven't been hooked on a visual novel for awhile since Sunrider Academy, so I'm really happy that this game hooked me from the beginning. I didn't know what I was going to be experiencing when I first loaded up the game and I have to say that I wasn't disappointed. For a huge anime lover, this game brings a lot to the table. The cast is voiced impressively in English and the art of the game was stylish to me. The choices in your decision making are diverse and will affect whatever route you plan on playing through. This game was originally an episodic visual novel, however I picked it up when all 4 episodes were released so I didn't have to wait to keep playing it. This game will surely entertain you, it contains romance, drama, comedy, and some sci-fi action to go along with it. I've already played through all the routes so right now I'm just waiting for a sequel (if there's gonna be one). PixelFade Studio did an amazing job with this game, there are a few flaws like re-using backgrounds and having a slight linear path for each route, but the game is still entertaining. The game is entirely in English but it is set in Japan, so it does kind of give you an animeish setting/aura. I HIGHLY recommend this game if you want an entertaining visual novel to play. Even though I usually prefer Japanese voice acting over English dub, this game's voice cast was exceptional and made everything sound natural. My favorite voice to listen to in the game is Valerie's. I can listen to her talk all day... Good luck on picking a best girl my fellow peers!			"

								I've tried a few visual novels before, but up to this point hadn't played anything that made me go ""Wow, this genre can be real amazing. I think I'll become more interested in visual novels overall."" I say up to this point, because this game changed that. I finally see what it is that some people find so enthralling about visual novels. This game made me laugh, worry, plan strategically, get nervous, blush, get frustrated, ponder wholeheartedly, fall in love, think of witty comebacks, and experience a whole heap of other emotions and experiences. It was fantastic. This game is so well written. There's real personality to your possible choices, and there are a plentiful amount of choices for you to make. You really dictate what turns the story takes, and how different characters' storylines develop. Sure, the game is still kind of short and so it's probably not currently worth the full $25 price tag, but that's because the game is still in early access and only halfway completed. I have no doubt that by the time the remaining chapters are added, I will have definitely gotten my money's worth out of this game, and then some. The mini games are fairly basic, but also decently enjoyable. I hope there are a few more matches in the future chapters, but so far the mecha aspect of the game has been done decently well, especially as it ties into the storylines overall. The bottom line is, this is by far the best visual novel I've ever played, and highlights all the great things that this genre of game can be. I absolutely recommend purchasing it.			"

												ACE Academy managed to get my attention by featuring two of my favourite anime genres: High school romance, and giant robots. But what started as an impulse buy to pass the time quickly became a solid favourite of my steam library the more hours I sunk into it.For starters, the game has a solid story to it. In a Gundam Build Fighters-esque setting where the world has become obsessed with giant robots called GEARs, you are a nameless protagonist (named by you) recently transferred from America to Japan to the pilot program of titular ACE Academy following the death of your parents.  It hit the right points throughout and kept me engaged through multiple playthroughs . And while it does flit more with the tropes of the high school romance side than the mecha side (Beach episode, hot springs episode, etc), there was enough science fiction here to keep it fresh. There are moments when it gets a too meta though (Less leaning on the fourth wall, more smashing it and then crushing the pieces into a fine dust), which while they made me laugh, also pulled me out of the story a bit.The characters are also a decent bunch, filling the usual tropes sure (Mayu is shy, Yuuna is kind, Kaori is Tsundere, etc), but giving each character their own strengths and flaws. I was also surprised to find the characters were all fully voiced too, and while some of the lines were strangely silent (It was still in Early Access as of writing), the cast is diverse enough that each and every character had their own unique voice, including the one-shot background ones.  It was all well recorded and well-acted too, which is always a bonus. The protagonist too is just enough of a blank slate to be relatable, but still has enough of a personality (some of which is dictated by you) to make it easy to relate to.The event CGs and music are also well done, with a good variety of pieces that for the most part fit in well with their respective events.There are some problems however. While the game is still in Early Access as of writing, I’m not sure how many have been, could be, will be or can be addressed, but I would at least mention them to give my honest opinion.The biggest flaw is the mecha combat. While I wasn’t expecting Titanfall for a VN, I was sort of expecting some kind of turn based system based on the screenshots, as opposed to the quick time sequence in the build I played. While this isn’t a game breaker for me, I can’t shake the feeling that mecha combat had a larger role to play in earlier ideas. There is, for example, a loadout screen filled with empty squares that is seen exactly once, and you go through several lessons that feel important to the mecha piloting process, but ultimately just serve as world building information. While the mecha aspect is a focus of the storyline, it feels a little under loved by the end of it as a result.There are also a few odd choices for who of the secondary cast gets to be shown, and who doesn’t. The VN goes the RWBY Volume One route of having most of them silhouetted, and while that makes sense for one scene unnamed characters, there are a few, such as the professors and your sister’s friends, who appear multiple times and whose appearances aren’t revealed.   On the flip side, there are characters that appear exactly once that are fully revealed, only to be never seen or heard from again. There was one character that was even shown using CG pieces instead, when having a silhouette with Yuuna giving facial reactions instead would have looked just as good, perhaps better.Speaking of CGs, while as I said before they are well done, there doesn’t feel like there’s enough of them. This might just be a personal issue of mine really, but I felt several times certain scenes needed more than just the text. This partly manifested as black screens with text describing interesting goings on, but also scenes that I’ve seen to be important in other non-eroge romance VNs (e.g. kissing) that are just described here. And while they're described well, it falls slightly flat when all you’re seeing is your girl smiling at you. A few more backgrounds might not go amiss either (An alternate library/study background, especially in Kaori’s route, was the most glaring one.)In the end though, these issues don’t really take away from the game as a whole.  These are just things that I think would make a great game greater. ACE Academy is still worth the asking price. If you’re looking for a good story and strong characters to while away some hours with, this game will definitely be worth your time.			"

								Both the writing and the voice acting (in English, for a change!) are excellent, and well worth your purchase.The characters are very likable (both those with romance routes and the side characters).There's a lot of great banter between your character and Nikki, your sister, which helps sell her as ""real"".  (She doesn't have a route, lest the siscons get too excited.)There's lots of dialogue choices throughout the game too -- most of them don't really matter in terms of choosing a route but they add more flavour and overall make the game more enjoyable and give it more replay value.The combat system is a little meh (mostly QTEs) but it doesn't happen often enough to be annoying, and fits in reasonably well with the story.  How well you do in combats does alter the story slightly as well, which can be interesting for repeat playthroughs, but there doesn't seem to be anything major hinging on it.  (Which is a good thing, in my view.)Romance is handled tastefully; there's no ""adult patch"" or anything like that.  It doesn't need one, the stories are still amazing.			"

The voice acting is top notch, the dialoge is realistic in most cases, and the characters are engaging and memorable. I am a little sad that that the game had to end abruptly, but that just makes me excited for the next chapters. My only request for future endeavors is to feature a Nikki route (or at least more options to spend time with her), as I feel that story could be interesting and heart warming.			"

												Gotta rewrite my review.I bought this game on early access since episode 2 came out. there are quite a lot changes.And i'm also more matured as a VN reader.First just want to let you know that, i've been reading VN quite a lot. But not really as much as those in fuwanovel forum. At least i've read some of the best and popular ones like, KnS 1 &2, Fate, Hollow ataraxia, Katawa Shoujo, G senjo, Majikois, and some others. So i can assure you that this review is not coming from someone who just got into VNs. And also, i didn't really into mechs so i never read something like muv luv or watch gundam. But ACE Academy for me i think is an exception to that.Now, lets talk about this VN. - The most important part is story, for me its considerably a bit lighthearted. You know your typical romance/school/sci fi/mech, etc. Those kind of genre that is pretty familiar with some of the recent anime that just came out.. But to be fair it's not bad. actually not bad at all. Cuz it's more like real life experience. That is what i like about VNs. Most of the stuff is relatable to us because we can choose how the story is going to progress. And even more in this VN, because you're dealling with your daily college stuffs, friendship, business(maybe?), family stuffs, and romance ofc. Unlike other hardcore VN that will just throw us into some unknown situations to us and let us decide on things that we didnt even know what to do about it. But in ACE Academy, it's not that hard to understand what's the story will progressing if you choose a certain choice in the game.- The humour is so good, i fell of my chair once. - The graphic/artstyle is decent, 7/10 for me. I just don't really like something that is too bright or too colorful. Maybe bcuz there are a lot of them in the recent animes. They're getting annoying, you know.  It's fine tho, it fits the theme very well. One of the coolest CG is when you see your Mech or in this case GEAR do some cool stuff. - The Music. Good enough, it's certainly fits most of the situations pretty well. But sometimes it can also be so annoying, because of it's so repetitive. Not really a bad thing since every single VNs out there do the same thing. Just my personal opinion tho.- Voice Actors. This is a litle bit hars but,My GOD! You western devs! You need to do a better job than this! I know you're a small team. But, really?? It's like an EAR R4PE! This VN don't have a Japs dub so i can't really compare them. Just think about it, the first time you watch DB or Naruto or One Piece or Fairy tail, Bleach or whatever.. and it's in English or in your native language, you'd still think they did a pretty decent job right? But this is just a complete mess! Only Valerie is good, great even.- Characters are all great. No comments about them :))- The Ending? Only two of the available routes are fit perfectlyOverall 8.5/10			"

								I've enjoyed what content has been released so far, I would like to see a little more of how the combat will change through later parts of the game with upgrades to the mecha. Definitely enjoyed having some time based choices, definitely brings more uniqueness to the game. Love the character art so far the mecha art leaves a bit to be desired though. The game has some good humor.After playing through the third episode I am thoroughly hooked. I am getting a feel for the story at this point, or at least I thought i was up until the end there. But anyways I am still seeing some great writing but more so the references made in the game that can be related to  modern culture. References to memes and television shows are scattered throughout and bring a very light humor to the visual novel. keep looking foward to the completion because this is going to be one worth replaying over and over, and thats a rare trait. Can't wait to see where it goes from here.			"

								This is a VN that doesn't force you to choose a girl you like, because the end goal is not to date/have sex with a girl, it is to just pass school and do good as a pilot. That is why I love this VN and hope that they will focus more on the Gear battles in later episodes. If you are like me, and are tired of the normal anime tropes then this is a fresh breath of air. The protagonist isn't a stupid perv, and the girls arn't just walking♥♥♥♥♥♥ They do at times make fun of how Japan and anime is a pervs paradise at the same time they cater to the people just in it for the girls. This is more of a life sim than a dating sim, which is why I love it!I write this after episode 2 and I don't plan on going any further before the full release, because I want to get the whole experience and not just small chunks of it.To the devs: Please make the roll-back function toggleable in the options menu.Up til episode 2: 10/10			"

								I'm very excited to see this VN be finished.I was really sad when I reached the end of episode 3, which in turn, means I'll be looking foward to the next episode.I've only played through the game once as of writing this review, but it's easy to see just how much replayability it has; there is quite a lot of decisions to be made. I was pleasantly surprised to see how good the voice acting was for the main cast, with a solid performance by the occasional side-character as well.The artstyle grew on me very quickly; I think it's quite warm and smooth. The story is simple, but very effective. Given the course of episode 3, it appears as though it'll become even better.The true substance of ACE Academy, however, lies with it's characters and the dialogue pertaining to them. During my first playthrough of ACE, I found the cast to be very likeable; there is a pleasant amount of depth to each character. The writing throughout the game is also quite good.One of my initial surprises of ACE was the addition of atmospheric sound, which really is a nice thing to have in a VN.That about sums up my broad review. This game shows a wonderful amount of potential, I really hope to see it succeed financially.Regardless of whether it's finished or not, it's certainly worth the 25$.Expect a charming and content-dense VN with ACE Academy.

												I love this VN, it has right mix of comedy and emotional times. I got the game on a whim, while it was on sale and ended up loving it, even to the point of recomending to/eventually gifting it to a twitch streamer I like to watch: https://www.twitch.tv/retrogaijin , It Is amazing. If I wouldn't have gotten it on sale I would still love it. After my first play through and failing to get the end I had been going for I played it for all of the endings. One of the best VNs I have played(haven't played many), but its gotten me into the Type of game.			"

								I would highly recommend this even though I'm not a fan of buying into Early Access Games.It's a unique take on the visual novel with some fun characters, a full voiced cast and a lot of choices that honestly surprised me in this. I'm not entirely sure how much the choices will affect the overall story because only a single episode has been released but there certainly were quite a few and it did seem to change dialogue for later conversations.The mech combat is a bit button-mashy and it would have been nice if it had been more skill based instead of being nearly a rhythm match game by using the wasd keys to just move according to enemy attacks when a prompt appears. Its combo system seems a bit broken too. It depends how you finish the attack phase and not your maximum combo, so if you mess up immediately, you're fine but if you get 19 perfect hits and mess up to start a new combo, it'll act like your max combo was 1 which is a bit frustrating and does lead to save scumming.The character choices seem a lot of fun and each interaction was pretty different.Totally need a sister route though, Nikki is definitely one of the funnier characters.

												100/10 will buy the sequel. This is my first visual novel and I am in love with this. This visual novel should totally be made into an anime, it's just that great. So here's a run down of this VN, you are the main character who moved from the United States to Japan to study at Ace Academy and you go through every day life, meeting new friends and battling it out with mechs. The story is really deep, in my opinion, and it just brings out all the feels. You'll be laughing a lot at some of the dialogue while other times you're annoyed or sad. This VN is great overall and would highly recommend this to anyone that likes animes, romance, comedy, slice of life, etc. It's just that great.			"

								This is my first review so I hope I'm doing this right. ACE Academy is a great visual novel. I love how active the devs are in trying to take our suggestions. Great game so far. I'm pretty new to VN's in general but this already is a great game and will continue to grow. Worth every single cent. If you're pretty new to VN's, this is a great game game to start with. ;310 Kaori's/10			"

								I wasn't sure what to expect from this game at first, but I was totally blown away! Not only is the artwork gorgeous, but I could not stop staring at the characters every time they popped up on the screen. They're all so well made, and each has a unique personality and backstory that only adds more to the game. One of the key points that I loved about this game was how fun it was to make different choices. The dialogue is hilarious, and the voice acting is so on key, at least to me. I also loved my MC, whom I named Kasiya Arian. I based him and the decisions he made after a roleplay character of mine, and it was so easy to stay true to that! A lot of times it's hard for multi-choice dialogue games to fit to what people want, but I found it so easy to get dialogue choices that fit to what I wanted him to be. I didn't regret a single choice and I had so much fun, it all felt very natural. Even now, I plan on jumping in and starting anew with a new Love Interest and new choices. I would reccomend this game to anyone and I hope people don't dismiss it because it's early access, because they'd be missing out.			"

								After finishing the highly anticipated 3rd episode I've finally decided to write a mini review for this game. I bought this game on a whim a few months back ,and back then quite honestly I had pretty low expectations for it. I bought it on the premise on english voices being added. Which i haven't really seen in a visual novel up until this point. After playing it however I found myself surprisingly invested in the story and characters of the game. To the point where after i beat episode two I waited in anticipation for months for episode three. Rambling aside if you are looking for a compelling story and characters ,and don't mind the art (which isn't bad ,but just average to me). Then you may enjoy this game. I look forward to seeing the rest of the game unfold.			"

								This game has high production values.  Like most good things in life though, it isn't finished yet.  I've gone down a couple of routes, and one route in particular seems like it would be painful to read.  Why every developer puts a tsundere in their visual novel is beyond me.  Maybe they think the players want to shut her up by putting toothpaste in her mouth, among other things.  Seriously, that is the only drawback to an otherwise promising start.  C'est la vie.   There is a fair amount of humor to be had.  As far as a visual novel goes, it is very polished.  Though there are a couple of mini-games, it really does not affect much.  Maybe they intend to fix this in the next release?  One final warning though, is that writing a review for a heavily-based story element is somewhat premature, since the biggest part of it is yet to be completed.  That said, there is a fair amount of work already done, and what they have looks promising.  What I've seen so far is worth it.  I would reccomend it, but as always buyer beware.  Especially with half-finished products.  Unfortunately, half finished projects tend to stay half finished.  If you are one of those people who can put a book down in the middle of an important plot point, by the game.  Otherwise, I'd suggest waiting until the game is completed.			"

								It is very much out of character for me to write a review. Particularly, for a product in early access or pre release form.ACE Academy will have to be the exception. Is this game worth $24.99, even in it's current unfinished state? YES.This VN is obviously crafted with such love and care, that it deserves to be a welcome addition to the game library of any fan of the genre. Excellent, fourth wall breaking and often hilarious dialogue is seemlessly paired with terrific voice acting, bright and colourful art, and characters that are incredibly endearing. Although at first glance, they are based on common Anime archetypes, each character intergral to the story has hidden facets to their personality that you will only discover by actually getting to know them, and I personally found all of them  interesting enough to warrant multiple playthroughs, just to see everything. The Mecha battles are simplistic, yet fun. The story is heartwarming, flows at a natural pace, and provides ample opportunities for laughs, and feels. Ace Academy is a treasure, and well worth your time and hard earned money. Highly recommended.			"

								Well Ive had my eye on this sence it was know as Kendo Crush. Witch I thought was good back then when i play the demo. Its a bit sad that Kendo Crush was canaceled but now we have ACE Academy to take its place so lets see how it is.Now after running though episode 1 for ACE Academy two times. I have to say so far Im impressed with how its turned out. The story so far not bad the sounds effects are good and the most imporant thing that I believe is that there are lots of choices to chose from. With all the diffrent choices to chose from it has some good replay ability that can change how the story unfolds. Ive had fun playing this, I have high hope's for this novel and cant wait for the next episode to be relesed.The only thing I dont like about it exactly is having to pay $24.99 for it when its still in early acess. Ohh yeah and it has some good voice acting not perfect but still good. Other then that I would rate this a 9/10 so far. Keep up the great work team.			"

												ACE Academy is a great visual novel. So great, in fact, that it may ruin all the other visual novels for you. There is no agonizingly slow intro, no fan service or forced sex scenes, the protagonist isn't a white knight-y wimp, the writing is snappy and funny, the characters are all very fun and endearing, despite being based on common archetypes, and surprisingly well voiced. And the best thing is, you get plenty of dialogue options to roleplay the protagonist however you like, even as a complete asshat, which is extremely rare in visual novels from my experience.Forget your Clannads and Grisaias, this is the top dog of VNs.

								I was pleasently surprised at how this game was easily able to suck me in with it's well written story and humorous comedy. Its battle system is pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I'm sure it'll be greatly improved once the game comes out of early access. The storytelling is where the game shines brilliantly at the moment. This game has amazing replayability value, as I constantly found myself wondering what would happen if I said or responded differently (There are quicktime events) and making different save files to find out as many differences as I could.Overall, this game is well worth the money and if you're interested in visual novel type games, then I highly recommend this one.

												Even though it's an early access game, I liked it enough so far. Kind of wished the MC's GEAR was namable (or it could be after the game's finished for all I know) but being able to name the MC is a nice touch...although they (the makers of the game) may not want to ask what the players named the MC as you could name them anything. ANYTHING.For some reason I, other than the MC's, hate the look of the GEARS and the AI's. They seem so...pointy? I don't know.Music? Eh, It works and it plays...good enough for me.People probably would complain at the current cost ($25) but I figured that it's to at least pay for things like the voice actors for example, so I hope the story is at least slightly better than average as this is all currently character establishment at where they stopped.Edit: Alright, its been a while and the full game is out of course...time for a somewhat bigger review. The QTE battles from the beginning is mostly gone now (in fact you now just press 'D' a few times, then spacebar when prompted and words for the finisher) and in its place is mutliple choices with a (if non-athletic I'm guessing) limited amount of time.Even without one of the three traits (which is basically, fitness, intelligence and...sensitivity?) that you can choose from the beginning, the game was fairly easy to guess if given a second to think about it. Either I spent too much time playing (hentai) Visual Novels or it was that damn easy of choices to make for this character or that.It's a fairly into the 'slice of life' genre that makes fun of itself, with small bits of seriousness here and there. Nothing overdramatic like 'what happened to me in the past, I must get vengance for it' kind of thing and somewhat more (considering that it IS a Visual Novel with mechs and future technology in it) down to earth focus on friends and family. A fair amount of choices that you can choose are silly enough to warrant a (save first) pick just to see what could happen.The voice actors were not horrible to listen to and I was very surprised at recognizing of a certain singer that I know of in Youtube playing a (supporting) role in this game.Now, I still like the game, although I now wish for the little sister DLC. Ha ha ha. (Somewhat) joking aside, make a Mei DLC. Seriously, flesh her out please. I won't mind shelling out a couple of dollars for her.			"

												This game was a very good visual novel. The plot was good, characters were good, art design was good, and everything was good! And in some cases, even great! But I personally believe that there could've been a little more in the story than what it actually gave us. Now, I may be wrong and it may have been the perfect amount for everyone else, but I personally believe that it had more to it, but they just let it slide. I know I have over 20 hours on record, but most of that was me skipping in order to play different routes that the game had to offer.Don't get me wrong, I really liked this game and found it very good! But there were some parts that I found unfinished and a little rushed. If those factors weren't in play here, I would say this game smacked it out of the park. But buy it and experience it yourself to see.But overall, for a price of $25, I would say wait until it's on sale. I'm not saying it’s bad in anyway; I'm just saying that you could spend that $25 on a different game than this. When it's on sale, however, I would recommend getting it! Now, if you really want it, then buy it now! You may find it fun and worth the money, but for me, I would wait. This game does have a lot of great things in it and you'll probably fall in love with it! There's nothing negative about this game at all that would make me think it's bad.Overall rating: 8.9/10			"

												This game has caught my interest and so far has been a very good game. The characters are extremely details and each seem to have their own issues and relations in life, which gives them more character! The story is developing nicely with great transitions as well, I, personally got so into the story that I felt my heart drop when it said I reached the end of episode 2. I can’t wait for the next installment! I’m expecting a great load from this game. I wonder how far its gonna go!Update: I LOVE THIS GAME, This game has one of the most enveloping stories I have seen in a long time! I rarely play visual novels over and over to get every path because I’m happy with the end of the first path I chose, but with this game... I will learn every path and every bit of info I can from it. That’s how in love I am with this game's story and characters!!			"

								I highly reccomend this game, to me it was a fresh take on the stale ""school life"" genre. I really enjoyed the story and the characters introduced.This is my first review so I can't really go in to full detail, (especially since I've so far only followed one storyline up to the cut off at the end of episode/chapter 2...) But I would like to talk about my Pros and Cons for this game.Pros:1. Diverse cast of characters; Cute little sister, Shy girl, flirty foreigner, Tsundere and of course, the idiot male friend.2. Diverse focus. Even if you're focusing on one character to get to know them or get romantically involved, at some points you HAVE to talk to someone else and it shows character development for all the characters.3. Not just a date sim, just because it has a date sim doesn't mean that's the focus of the story, in fact some of my FAVORITE dialouge is silly banter between Shou, the male friend, and your character.4. Character artwork is JUST as good as the character personalities.5. Full cast voice acting. We have voice acting  and not just for the main characters like your family and friends, even the faceless background characters like classmates and teachers have voices.Cons:1. Again with Artwork, some of the full cut scenes are not necessarily poorly drawn, but they need to be redrawn if nothing else for the sake of functional anatomy. 2. Voices, some of the voices for the main characters sound... off, not necessarily bad, some just don't fit the characers, and others just sound like they were recorded on a terrible mic. Other than that voices are great.3. The ""Gears"" I am 100% fine with the name, but the mech suits, in my opinion, look very bland and need a little bit of visual flair. There is one acception being somthing that happens to the main character's Gear after a certain point in the game BUT that new look is temporary and I don't want to spoil anything more.4. Combat, Quick time events are used throughout the game including quick reaction dialogue and such, but  the combat mechanics are severely lacking. it's just a mater of you have about three to four seconds to press either w,a,s or d as it appears on the screen, you fail to press it in time or press the wrong one, you take damage. As a counter to my arguement, this game is 1) still in early access, and 2) not a fighting sim. I know this, but I feel once the game has a bit more story done to it they should go back and refine the combat system just a little bit that way it's more fun to fight in your big robot.Again all of my complaints are either only a problem because the game is early access, or can be fixed in an upcoming update due to the fact it's in early access. Over all for an uncompleted game with a few quirks that may bug me but Certainly don't take much away from the game if at all, I give this game a 9/10. Depending on how they finish it it may jump up to 10/10			"

								TL;DR: Buy it.Pros: -Fully Voice Acted (minus the MC)-Ridiculous amount of choices and long stories.-Devs are creating this for fun not monetary reasons.-Devs listen to the community. (Proof: Creation of the Mayu route)-Easy to get attached to the characters.-Every choice will affect your story in some form.Cons:-Incomplete (At the time of this review)-Since this VN isn't the devs primary focus, updates are slow. However, the next update is the final one.-First full project for the dev team so it's still rough in certain spots.-Mandatory QTE battles.			"

								As a huge VN fan (Fate/stay Night and The Fruit of Grisaia being my current favourites) I can safely say this is by far one of the best Visual Novels on Steam right now. Amazing art, in depth characters, good humour and plenty of choices are just a few of the reasons why I love it so much. Don't even get me started on the English VA work, which is a huge plus.Only two episodes out so far, but that was roughly ten hours of content right there after running though all four routes, with two more episode on the way.10/10 Yuuna = Best girl			"

												I cannot stress enough how much I enjoyed my time with this game. The main story takes about 4 hours to complete but the replay value is 10+ with all the different routes you can take. It's refreshing to hear English voice actors as well as a unique art style. The soundtrack is just simply amazing and fits in the game perfectly and makes the atmosphere all the more great. I enjoyed interacting with the characters, getting to know them. The characters are well fleshed out and all of them are amiable. I also enjoyed the little references of American and some Japanese pop culture. All in all it's a great pick up and though the story is lacking, it makes it up with character development and VERY likable settings. Really made me sad that it ended.			"

Seriously I like that visual novel. I like the style, I like the mecha. I also laughed at the fact that u can purposely chose to miss or trip when you are fighting. The voice acting is probably not the best, but I kinda found it quite good enaugh.Can't wait to read the rest.Pros:Nice StoryNice characternice desingA LOTS OF CHOICES and lots of them really impact the story.Nice voice actingEnglish voice actingCon:I try to think hard.... and the only con I can find his the music witch sometime get a bit boring. But hey it's no big deal.I DEFINATLY RECOMAND THAT GAME.EDIT: I have 3 hours in the game now, and I'm pretty sure I just scratched the surface of it. I really like this game.There's a few misspelling in the game. Being french canadian I normaly don't see that kind of thing, But i was able to notice 2 of those, so far. It's no big deal tough...

								Well i was so pleasantly suprised by this gem of a game that i am still grinning like an idiot while typing out this reivew. Obviosuly the game is still early acsess and only 2 episodes out of 5 are currently released, but don't let that deter you! There is plenty for you to enjoy already and a wealth of choices at you're desposal. Episode 3 is also well on the way i don't think i have ever been this hyped for a visual novel release before.I'll try to keep it breif but here are some of my reasons why i think ACE Academy is worth your money.-Great Writing: The writing was great it was funny and charming, i loved the movie refrences.-Great Characters: So far i really like the characters they all have their own unique personalities and quirks, good romance options too *wink* wink*.-Lots of choices: The choices in this game come frequently and offer some vastly different and intresting changes on the narative and adds great replayability. -Gear Management: We haven't seen to much of this right now but it's intresting and i'm looking forward to seing more of this as the game gets updated.-Developers that listen: It's great when developers listen to suggestions and criticisim and use that to improve the game. They are now writing a romance route for Mayu aswell so i salute them. -Great Art: What can i say i love that art style.			"

Early Access Review
								Hmm my honest thoughts of this VN is that is pretty good but i played both this and kendo crush and doing a complete analazys i can strongly say this VN is pretty decent i wouldn't call it a masterpiece per say like most people would but there are a couple of things i have to say 1. the protagonist both Kendo Crush and Ace Academy of course diffrent but if you have to ask my perfered protagonist i have to say Kendo Crush reason is that you can have him be a nice guy or a total badass deliquent but for Ace Academy is more like his personality is already preset for you so your mostly choices that don't seem to affact his personality well that is my opinion 2. Am really disappointed that the protagonist dose not have a character spirt instead they do a first person view rather third person a lot of VN have the protagoinst in first person and when i played Kendo Crush and saw that the protagonist was viewed as a third person i thought that was really cool but when i played Ace Academy and it went with the tradisional first person i was really disappointed in that i played a lot of VN you can say am a veteran VN player  3. For music it fit fine but not it was not that amazing to say 4. For each character personality excluding protagonist there personality was fine there was nothing wrong with them 5. As for character introduction kind of disappointed in that as how the protagonist met with the first heroin it was just too simple depending your choices of course but still it was way too simple for a introduction for example in Ace Acadamy the introduction was spoil alert here ( met on the bus..... really thats how they met just like that) for Kendo Crush the introduction was introduce better example spoil alert ( first met in homeroom but was not considered a introduction as the protagonist did not intract with her he only intract with her after he saved a neko from a tree is you don't know what a neko is is basicly japanese word for cat. I can go on more and more but am not so is this VN recommended yes for those who are new too VNs but for those who are Veteran VN players i have to say i don't recommended it for veteran players but for new VN players its a yes			"

Thoughts:Salutations fellow Steam community members! This was my first time ever playing or buying a visual novel and I was thoroughly impressed at the amount of content ACE Academy offers. As gamer new to ""visual novel"" games, I enjoyed being able to have the options to choose what the main character (the player) does to develop one's relationship with the other characters; I was met with heart-warming moments, comedic scenes, serious encounters, and an intriuging story that unfolded as I went further. I haven't quite played all the routes quite yet (only finished one so far), but I couldn't resist leaving a review before I went back and do the others. Be Aware:~ The game does reuse scenery quite a bit~ So far I have done one playthrough of many to come and I am currently sitting at about 7 hours of gameplay for time estimate~ I bought this game when it was on sale~ The voice acting is pretty decent, but it is as most of the other reviews say ""It's just there to help with atmosphere."" I certainly agree it does!~ I did notice a few grammer issues like past-tense and pretense errors during my gameplay, but should not annoy you too much if you aren't strict about grammer~ The art style is modern/contemporary and is easy to adapt to~ The music really kicks in at the appropriate times working with the other elements of the gameplay to create that comedic, serious, or warm moment in timeGenre's I Thought the Game Fell Into:~ Mecha~ Sci-Fi~ Romance~ Comedy~ Slice of Life~ SchoolFinal Notes:I hope my review encourages one's decision whether or not if this game might be something one would enjoy. I watch anime myself and I love having the options to weave how the story will unfold, instead of having the story be one way. Definately would recommend this game to anyone who watches anime with the following genre tag combination I listed above. ^_^ I look forward to seeing a sequel and any new VN's the developers of this indie company will produce!

												TL:DR At the bottom!!I've played a few VN's before but I have to say this is hands down the best I've played so far! The characters are very well voiced, and their stories and personalities are interesting and quite funny at times.  I was suprised at first to hear english voice acting and it did take a few minutes to get used to it at first, but I really enjoyed listening to everyone talk. Never did I feel like I wanted to rush through certain dialogue or skip through anyone's lines. Some of the jokes in this game had me almost rolling on the floor laughing (Ceonardo DiLaprio scene). The memes and references included in some of the dialogue choices were HILLARIOUS (at one point there is an option to say something like ""much fall, very dissapoint."") of course there are much more serious choices too.On that note I think the game does a relatively good job at transitioning from comedic scenes to neutral to serious scenes. There are a few points where you go to bed on a serious note and wake up kinda ignoring last nights mood, (possibly where an episode ended? I bought the game after it had been fully released so I'm not sure) however this is nothing to be bothered with really, it might not even be noticeable to some people.This game really got me invested in the story and the characters (most RPG's do, such as mass effect) where I really felt my choices mattered (unlike mass effect grrrrr LOL) and I absolutely love the main characters relationship with his little sister (kawaii~desu!!) and their uncle. The scenes with her in them kinda made me wish I had a little sis too! (N-no I'm not a sis-con!! Baka!!)TL:DRGreat game!! 11/10 bought it while it was on sale (had it in my wishlist for a while) for $19 I would easily pay the full price for this game. Honestly gave me more enjoyment then many full priced retail games did!  Kudos to the devs, voice actors, and everyone else involved for an awesome game!! BUY THIS GAME IF YOU LIKE VN's, YOU WON'T BE OF DISSAPOINT COMRADE!! Also as a note (you're still here? go buy the game already!) This is the first review I've made for a game before (and yes this is an alt cuz I'm a closet weeb) and I've played many a steam game in my years of PC gaming, so that alone speaks for how good this game is. STOP READING THIS AND GO BUY IT!!! what?you're still here?the review is done.nothing more to see here.oh okay fine...DUCKS FLY TOGETHER!!!!			"

								I adore this visual novel. My favorite part about it, I think, is that in structure it's more similar to a choose your own adventure game than it is to most visual novels (that I've played at least). The sheer breadth of choices for simple things is something I really really appreciate. Too often I've been told that ""this person is you"" but have felt a profound disconnect between their actions and thoughts and my own; not so here. In fact, there was only one point I ever felt like my reaction wasn't amongst the choices and one point where I felt a choice was so VERY correct that I laughed and whooped, both a product of my strange sense of humor. (Small spoilers in the next paragraph) The only disconnect occurred when your sister gives your bike a little makeover. I wanted to laugh my♥♥♥♥♥off, own it, and then proceed to drive that♥♥♥♥♥♥everywhere. Every time someone made a remark about it, I would proudly proclaim that my sweet little sister wanted to help decorate my bike and I just couldn't say no--she really loves unicorns, can you tell? I would keep doing that until SHE was embarrassed and BEGGED me to let her clean it off. The very correct choice was when asking your Broseph to go to the arcade with the ""The time of cyber skirmishing is upon us."" choice. Anyway, the visual novel itself is wonderful and I love all the characters (I still can't choose a best girl). I don't think there were any of them I didn't like. I kept wanting a button to affectionately pat Nikki (the sister) on the head when she was being adorable. The setting itself is really interesting and a welcome departure from the standard faire (and the option to  name your special move was something I adored). I, quite frankly, can't wait for the next chapters, though I'll probably wait until they're all out and the game is 100% done to play again. I only have two criticisms. The first is that, while I adored all of the memes and little in-jokes, I have to wonder to what extent they're applicable in, y'know, Japan. For example, though I can't be certain as I've never been there, I don't think Japan has stereotypical American fratboys like the kind Shou lives with. It seems to me like the setting would have been better-served with simply having the initial move be one, say, across to the other coast of the United States. I imagine this is simply an artifact from when the visual novel was Kendo Crush and more fully Japanese in setting. Still, this is a minor complaint. My big one is stuff like THIS! Look at it! Look at that♥♥♥♥♥♥ And it doesn't end, there are more later! And I can only imagine there will be more still in the future chapters! This is just revolting, insane! These writers just have no respect for the laws of nature or man. They're sick and they need to be put down like the sick dogs that they are. Some men just want to watch the world burn.

												I have already reviewed this game many, many times and I can do nothing but sing praises for it... I stand by every word I've said about it, every last one. This game has become my absolute favorite VN; a ton of options that really change up the dialogue which amps up replayability by an enormous amount, all major routes feeling very satisfying, a very interesting world to play around in and learn about.Artistically speaking I love the style it's very pleasing to look at and its mild animation is nice, the writing (save for the cringe-worthy-yet-charming-to-some-extent references and humor options) is very well done and very natural. Also the more detailed Mech artwork; superb, simply superb. I still can't say much about the Voice Acting as again I don't really care for voice acting in my VN's but if the voice direction has the same care as the dialogue options in the writing then I'm sure it's just fine.And the ending, no spoilers, is extremely well done and all the routes are highly satisfying.This is still by far one of the best VN's I've played and in fact has become my ""bar"" as it were. I've honestly been having a hard time enjoying other VN's due to the fact ""eh, it's not as good as Ace Academy"".. If you haven't bought it and enjoy this type of game (visual novel, lots of choices, cute girls with fun routes) then I highly suggest you do so, it is still entirely worth it.I highly look forward to this teams next project.

Thoughts:Salutations fellow Steam community members! This was my first time ever playing or buying a visual novel and I was thoroughly impressed at the amount of content ACE Academy offers. As gamer new to ""visual novel"" games, I enjoyed being able to have the options to choose what the main character (the player) does to develop one's relationship with the other characters; I was met with heart-warming moments, comedic scenes, serious encounters, and an intriuging story that unfolded as I went further. I haven't quite played all the routes quite yet (only finished one so far), but I couldn't resist leaving a review before I went back and do the others. Be Aware:~ The game does reuse scenery quite a bit~ So far I have done one playthrough of many to come and I am currently sitting at about 7 hours of gameplay for time estimate~ I bought this game when it was on sale~ The voice acting is pretty decent, but it is as most of the other reviews say ""It's just there to help with atmosphere."" I certainly agree it does!~ I did notice a few grammer issues like past-tense and pretense errors during my gameplay, but should not annoy you too much if you aren't strict about grammer~ The art style is modern/contemporary and is easy to adapt to~ The music really kicks in at the appropriate times working with the other elements of the gameplay to create that comedic, serious, or warm moment in timeGenre's I Thought the Game Fell Into:~ Mecha~ Sci-Fi~ Romance~ Comedy~ Slice of Life~ SchoolFinal Notes:I hope my review encourages one's decision whether or not if this game might be something one would enjoy. I watch anime myself and I love having the options to weave how the story will unfold, instead of having the story be one way. Definately would recommend this game to anyone who watches anime with the following genre tag combination I listed above. ^_^ I look forward to seeing a sequel and any new VN's the developers of this indie company will produce!

												ACE Academy is possibly the best western-produced visual novel I've ever played, tied only with Katawa Shoujo. Its characters are generally funny, and their struggles and emotions feel genuine and sympathetic. The CG artwork generally looks great, especially the mecha scenes, and the music services the experience well. It's got some decent length to it, and the characters are all charming enough to make the routes worth playing, so there's good replay value here. Even the stock tsundere archetype character feels charming when you get to know her, though she only really opens up on her own route.  One particularly good thing about this game is how it's fully voice acted (there's a few lines by minor characters that aren't voiced, all the main characters are fully voiced, and most of the minor characters are too). As in, it's all in English. Now the voice acting isn't perfect, but it's not bad either and it lends a tremendous amount of flavor to these characters and makes them come alive in a way that a lot of other visual novels don't. After seeing how well it worked here, I definitely hope more western VN devs spend money doing this, because it adds tremendously to the game experience.I didn't experience any technical glitches or issues during my playthrough, so that's always a plus, and it's a pure VN running the renpy engine with no oddball code tricks so it should run nicely even on low end systems. I also particularly like how certain choices, especially during fights, are time limited. (You generally have ~4 seconds to make your choice in these situations.) It really keeps you on your toes and sells the notion that this is a tense situation that needs quick thinking. There's no stat management or other gameplay mechanics here; it's a pure visual novel, executed nicely.The devs also seem pretty responsive to the community, and they do stuff like give you the OST for free instead of making you pay extra for it like most devs do. I get the feeling that they care a lot about the story they're telling and care about the craft, rather than nakedly grasping at profit. That's the good, but no review is complete without talking about the bad. So, the plot itself is not hugely meaningful or nuanced in its own respect. It's a guy's life as he tries to become a mecha pilot. It's mostly slice of life (very enjoyable slice of life, mind you), with a serious plotline in the background that starts strong but doesn't go the distance. If you like slice of life with enjoyable and charming characters, you'll love this game, but if you're looking for a serious business story, you might not enjoy it so much since there's not much seriousness and what serious plot there is fizzles out in a fairly unsatisfying manner.Nowhere is this more apparent than the ending. It has a serious emotionally high stakes premise that builds up in the background for a fair part of the game, but ultimately when it comes to a head, it feels unsatisfying and doesn't have much emotional payoff. Worse, you get invested in all these characters and hope to see what happens with their lives and relationships... But the game just ends and leaves you hanging.  Don't get the wrong idea. We're not talking about a terrible ending like Mass Effect 3, Fallout 3, or Sunrider Liberation Day's pre-DLC ending. It's just a disappointing ending because the conflict ""resolves"" itself too quickly (but doesn't really resolve itself), leaving everything open ended and hanging. Some people might enjoy an open end that they can fill in with their own imagination, but I prefer a little more structure and would have really liked an epilogue to see what happened to all these characters I grew to care for. It's like... Imagine a burger that's delicious up until the very last bite. Then that last bite is bland and unseasoned. Not bad, just... Meh, especially in context of a burger that was until then juicy and delicious. That's this game's ending. There is also a slight problem - more an annoyance really - where if you choose to spend time with a character you haven't spent much time with up until that point, the game will give you a tell rather than show summary of what you would've done together if you had spent more time with them, and then lead in to the event you would've seen at that point if you'd been spending time with them all along. (Example: Mayu likes music, but I'd been focusing on Yuuna so I didn't know this. When I chose to spend some time with Mayu late in the game because everyone else was busy, the game told me I'd been spending time with her in the music room helping her set up a band, then had me helping her with the audition for her band's vocalist even though I knew nothing about this beforehand.) This is better than just assuming stuff's happening without telling the player anything, but it still tickles the back of my mind.  But beyond that, there's not many other flaws. I mean, I could always ask for more CGs, more content, but it's not like there's not a decent amount of content here already. I could ask for AAA quality voice acting, but that's unreasonable given the game's budget and the voice acting we have is charming, flavorful and nice in its own respect.  Also, I should give my above criticism a caveat. While the serious plotlines generally don't go anywhere, some of the individual emotional scenes are very touching - the scene with your little sister in the park late at night comes to mind immediately, and generally all the scenes where the girls talk about their innermost feelings are good too. This is a game that is driven by its characters, and it's at its best when showing these characters. It's not a plot driven game.TLDR: Great slice of life visual novel with appealing, vibrant, and fun characters and a great deal of humor, let down only by meh ending and its main serious subplot fizzling out in said ending. Definitely worth the money they're asking for. 9/10 would buy again, likely to buy these devs' next game if it's as good as this one.			"

												Great game. If you guys haven't checked out their next project Crystalline, seriously go look at it. It looks phenomenal. A VN with 3d models instead of sprites. Ace was dope though. 10/10 would sexy police officer again. ""You're under arrest."" The developers explained the reasoning for the seemingingly quick cutoff though. So don't think you're alone in thinking about it. It was intentional for a reason. Check out their devstream and they talk about it!			"

								This is the very first V.N. I've ever played and I love it. For an alpha it is impressively done, with interesting characters, choices, and I personally dig the story. This game makes you feel like you truly are part of the story and you can tailor make your own anime character, I even feel like I'm staring in an anime tv show. Even with the branching choices and excellent V.O.'s and multiple outcomes, I wish this story would continue forever I'm interested to see how everyone's stories play out through their entire school experience and hopefully if they get more feedback and support they'll make more for the story after their next episode cause I would play for a continued story. A must-play game worth the price!			"

								Arguably one of my favorite VNs available right now and I haven't finished it yet! The voice acting is superb and fits each character and their archetype nicely. Usually visual novels have that Japanese humor that you'd only find funny if you were, well, Japanese. I was surprised to go through this and find genuinely funny moments that made me laugh. For example, if you choose to hang out with one girl at a certain point, you and her hold tryouts for a singer in a band. A British student with a name obviously a play on Simon Cowell enters the room and harshly critiques everyone. Plenty of cool choices too, though not all of them make a difference (understandably). Anyway, yes you should buy this game. EDIT: After finishing it today, I want to thank the creators of this game personally. While I won't go into spoiler territory, there's a scene near the end of Episode 4 involving the hero's father. My own father passed away a few months ago and I felt I could really relate to my character and his feelings. The part that really got to me though was finding out that your father's name is James. James was my own father's name, and this really struck a cord with me. While I know that this is pure coincidence, I thank the creators immensly for this game. Also, Yunna is best girl and you're  wrong if you think otherwise.			"

												One of the best visual novels/dating sims that I have recently played. Great characters, well written story, and wonderful visuals. The music alone is a great aspect that really fits the theme of the game. There are various dialogue options and potential routes you can choose from, all which are unique from each other. Also, there is plenty of humor within the story that makes the expericence much more enjoyable. I would defintely get this game, especially if you want to try out new visual novels.			"

Early Access Review
								Before this game, I tended to avoid early access games. However, the premise and visuals swayed my decision and I gave it a shot.What followed was the most entertaining visual novel I've played.The story is very sound, with a appealing theme (you attend a school that lets you pilot giant robots. What's not to like?) and plenty of interesting characters to interact with. On those characters; they're very fleshed out and each have their own funny quirks, even if they do tend to follow certain stereotypes (tsundere, shy rich girl, mary sue girl, seductive girl and goofball best friend). But rather than drag the experience down, these characters help make it that much more entertaining. Shou is by a big margin one of the funniest characters I've seen in a VN, and yet despite that even he has a level of depth that helps you fall for these characters. As far as voice acting is concerned, there were only one or two that could potentially be annoying, yet I found these negligible. Also noticed however that some of the silhouetted characters shared voice actors. I can understand why but it was noticable. The music was good too, and fit the scene, though could get repeditive at times. The art design was pretty cool and, for the mechs at least, improved greatly after episode three. As far as mech battles are concerned, they're nothing more than quicktime WASD segments. While a part of me wishes the battle system could be a little bit more advanced than mere quicktime events (maybe something like from the Sunrider series), it's only a minor complaint, given the mecha combat isn't the main focus of the story.And as for the story, while it does have choices, the game will eventually steer you back onto the main story path. That said, the options you're given are interesting to discover, leading to a greater replayability than most other VNs I've played. The scroll-back function is unique as well, and allows to greatly explore all possible options. Plus, with four possible love interests (the fourth added after community pleading), it opens story options up even further. While the story did end with much less oomph than what I was expecting, it was still a satisfying ending well worth the wait.TL;DRThis is a great VN, very entertaining and you'll be replaying it again and again to experience all it has to offer. A few nitpicks here and there, but overall one I'd highly recommend.9/10			"

								As of this review the game is currently on Ep.3 and let me say its a cliff hanger. Now this is my first time actually engaed in a visual novel, most of my gaming came from playing First.Person.Shooter as a kid, like Halo, or Medal of Honor. The game, story wise is incredable, with its cast of lovable charcters that grow onto you as you progress as a male transfer student to the ACE Academy in Japan. There is combat during the mech matches (ie. you fight in giant robots ""plot of the game""), but in reality its mostly quick time events, and choices that requires you to press an option in about 3 seconds or else it will pick randomly or fail you on it.Romance is prevelent as theres a total of 4 girls to choose, each with unique personalites and the small decesions you make with them if you want to be friends or more.Voice acting is great although you may here when the voice acter speaks a little too far or close to the mic giving them an echo effect sometimes, but really its nothing that ruins the game. As for the art its very sleek and clean and has lots of details in it. Although background charcters like workers, gaurds, generic college students and professers are just black cut outs, yet they have voice acters, so they're not just black silhouettes  with nothing to say but text.As for the story its really engaining with the occasional pop culture refrences to anime tropes, popular animes, memes and movies like the God Father hidden in the dialouge. Each charcter has a hidden past you must pry into as everyone even your self is getting to know each other and part of the game is to interact with everyone but becarful of what you say and risk hurting relationships with others.Price value is a bit high for a game I just played for 5 hour (till Ep. 3, game is still incompelet at the time of writing this), but its worth it as theres animations, insted of still art charcters, some 3d modeling, and great moments that will make you just laugh.

								I like the story and the comprehensive choices and details.  There\'s so many storylines, I\'m not sure if any of it weighs on future outcomes, but it appears to have some impact in certain situations.  The english dialogue is amazing & appreciated edition to the genre.  I don\'t see this option barely ever so I\'m extactic they chose this route.  The voices/tones/attitudes of the characters give them a lot of individuality & attaches you to your favorite characters.  The character story depth is fun to follow and with the variety that will make you wonder what you missed out on. The game adds a nice twist to choices based on your character type & some other twists to test your agility & memory.  The music is definitely fun and sets the tone for the situations.  Art is great.  There\'s so much I may have missed something but if you like this genre worth a buy.  I\'m not through the story, but I\'d love to see more like this one.			"

								Fifty Shades of Gear was 10/10 - IGN(My Actual review down here v)This is a rollercoaster. Not just a kiddy ride, or a scary loopy-loop, this one is all sorts of rides. It was a ride full of emotion and experiance. The characters had made you have a connection, and the story was really interesting. Most of my experiance was comedy, and too be quite honest, I loved all of it. It made me laugh, alot. But when episode 4 came out, I noticed our ride was finished. Every character I loved somewhat goes away after those credits. I didn't get any girls unfourtantly, but thats because I kept going the ""Not my type"" route (if that even is one?). Anyways, back on topic, this was worth all the money I paid. I recommend you buy this game if you're into romance, comedy, action, and suspense.

								I bought this game, and hesitated on playing for a while. Now I feel stupid for waiting; the story has everything I like to see! The voicing is done in English, but the voice actors weren't lazy or half-effort trying when they did this, so its not bad! I'm always overwhelmingly relieved to see (hear?) voice actors from the West (Canada in this case) doing their jobs well. It's not as glamorous as hollywood, but it's still an acting job!The combat you get involved in during the game doesn't have wiz-bang animation, but you have to button mash or lose so you don't really notice that anyway. The characters are drawn very well, the scenery is futuristic and artistic on its own, so its easy to get into the world they want you to see.Also tons of choices, some are timed forcing you to make a decision quickly... And some are varied quite well. Such as getting to choose your response with several different tones, rather than just variations of the same response like many VN's force. I personally enjoy harassing my little sister, like any big brother should.10/10, got to be a teenage smart♥♥♥♥♥again! And the game's protagonist bears whatever name you want him to, he rides motorcycles and he's a mech pilot. It's a game after my own heart.SYNOPSIS:+ Excellent character art+ No half-effort voicing+ No spelling errors+ Characters actually have different personalities+ Many choices in dialogue+ I get to relive being a smart-alec young man+ The story is interesting if you like sci-fi, mecha (even mechwarrior-ish somewhat)+ The bartender laughs when you ask for 'healthy' food- Combat animation is a little lackluster- They're speaking English in Japan lol- Would be nice to be able to swap WASD to arrow keys for the combat button-mashing, but this is minor			"

												ACE Academy is kind of a weird game to review for me. I really love the game, they really put in a bunch of content in the game that i genuinly liked, but at the same time, I felt it missed a few things. Replayability is really high. Not only are there four girls you can romance, but you can also do a friendship ending with your bro. I liked most of the characters, some definately more than others. Not just for the route choises, you also chose what type of person you are, from being an athelete, smartie, or a guy that is really observative. Athletic lets you accel at doing physical stuff, which could impress the more physical types of characters, and occasionally highlight quicktime events that'll let you do the best at. Intelligence was probably the weakest, since it was mostly for remembering things, but it did help with characters like Mayu and Yuuna that like guys that are more inclined to read. Intuitive gives you some extra conversation options that you wouldn't have otherwise, and I think it was my favorite of the builds for that. The artwork and music is really good. They have multiple artists, and it definately shows, especially in the mecha section, but they all seem to kind of blend well together, and none of them look bad. Some of the music pieces I really wanted to jam out to, like the music that plays in mecha battles for one. The voice acting was also good, though there were some characters that sounded terribly directed, bored, and or had a bad mic. The main cast are all well voice acted though. I especially liked Nikki's VA. VA is in English BTW. So to some people that might be a turn off, but I like English VA, and have heard some of the actors in previous indie games, so it was nice to hear them again for me at least.The bad points are, I think they put focus into some things, and ignored other things they could have done. The game is filled with memes and anime refferences, and a bunch of events that don't really have much substance other than ""spend time with your waifu."" I was kind of surprised when the game ended my first time through, because it was really underwhelming for me on how it ended. Mecha battles weren't really as fun as the first match, which left me wondering why bother programming the prelims mash d to attack and all if it was never gonna come back? Not to mention, there were a lot of areas in the game that were really American. An example: Kaori's date at an anime convention. Events like that in Japan are much different than the ones in America, and the inconsistancies in Japan stuff rubbed me a little weirdly. It felt like, maybe, the most they knew about Japan, was from Anime or video games like Persona. There were a lot of little things they put in the game, like the game creators in the game universe, that took away from the time they could have put into actually adding on to the plot. In the end, looking on the main plot, it was pretty underwhealming. I also wasn't very fond of the more perverted options you could have chosen but that's just me.Does that make it a bad game? No. I think it was a fun game to play, it just had a lot of hit and miss moments. Even with the amount of filler content in game, spending time with everyone was still fun, and I liked coming back and seeing what each dialogue option did.  I do think, that if you're interested in the game, its a fun game, well worth your time... unlessyou hate open-ended endings.			"

								I highly recommend this game. The Story, the Setting, and just all the different characters help make this game come to life. I was a little hesitant before buying this game seeing as I don't really play VNs at all really, but after buying the game and playing through it twice so far, I've never looked back. Hopefully Episode 4 won't really be the last one if anything because I want the story to keep expanding. 10/10 for the game itself, 11/10 for the Soundtrack imo.			"

												I really enjoyed this game however it had some flaws like most games do but it could use more information in the HUD i.e. Date. I am really upset with the ending. I don't really know how to feel other then upset even though they had explained why they ended it the way they ended it. I just feel like there was no ending. At least a good one.The girls was alright but it would be nice to have a look at all the girls personality and a score of how they feel about you to get a better insight of how much time you have to put into them before getting closer to them.I could go on and on but I want to finish with this game had a lot of potential but it feels like it was wasted because of the RPG and there was almost no real RPG elements other then the inital character creation that made some changed scenes; however it didn't make any real game impact. I was pretty upset that you really couldn't change anything about your character other then your name and type. Now if you want to buy a game for the Visual Novel, buy the game for a 8/10 storyline and if you're looking for a Visual Novel and some RPG elements, don't buy this game since it is mostly story.

												Wow! A VN without raunchy pictures in order to persuade people to buy the content? What is this madness?! In all seriousness, ACE Academy is a well-written, almost fully-voiced (due to the MC not having a voice which is perfectly fine), and emotionally engaging story with several routes that the player/reader can choose to pursue. Sure, some of the characters are a bit cliché` and the puns are hilariously bad at times, but that doesn't detract from the quality of the game at all. After a short amount of time passed playing this VN, I found that I had been drawn into this game in the same manner that I get sucked into a really good anime. I can't fully articulate to anyone who is reading this review as to why I got so invested, but all I know is that I spent an entire Saturday playing this game from start to finish with no regrets. I chose to do the Valerie and Yuuna routes based on personal preferences, and I look forward to playing through the other routes in time. Hopefully, someone will see this review, give ACE Academy a chance, and enjoy the experience as much (or more than) I did. TL;DR: Brace yourselves for the emotional rollercoaster of feels. I give ACE Academy a solid 9 drills that will pierce your heart (and the heavens) out of 10 Mech fighters. Enjoy :)			"

								First early access visual novel that I play. I can say that they did a great job :D. The story is interesting. It only get serious at the end of chapter 3. ( which the end is a cliff hanger xD )The interaction with the characters are fun as well since there are lots of choices to choose from, an some of these choices are funny xD.  There are romance in this game as well. ( Can't decide between Yuuna and Kaori xD as both of them are awesome. Valerie is amazing as well but not really my type xD. Mayu belong to Shou) I also like the voices of the characters. The VAs did a great job. The soundtracks are nice to listen to especially the battle music(those are just epic xD)What I don't like is the battle system. It is quite dull as you just use the wsad buttons on the keyboard.  But that is just a minor problem for me xD. (It's easy to win :P )I also don't like how they end the episode 3 with a cliff hanger but that is just a small problem xDOverall 10/10 Totally Recommended :D "

												Ace Academy is easily one of my favorite novels. It has beatiful art, multiple unique and interesting routes, and funny choices with voice acting. I'm very glad I bought it and completed the different routes. Having Amalee as a voice actor is just a bonus. I can't wait for their upcoming novel with natewantstobattle.			"

												Possibly one of the best visual novels I've played.While lacking a tad on the design side for minor characters; (Black silhouettes)It was still an incredibly enjoyable experience with witty writing, some nice feels, and overall a generally entertaining story.Choices affect the game minorly; mainly deciding relationships.However, I actually replayed the game just to see what happens in all the different routes as the writing is genuinely that enjoyable.Overall 9/10 I'd reccomend trying it out.

												A Visual Novel from a western developer who for the most part actually understands how to make a VN. (Theres no eroge so they are sort of missing out there but thats not a 100% requirement, it would be nice though.)Pros:A slice of life story that isn't boring. (This is hard to do for the most part, especially without eroge.)Romance that develops overtime and doesn't seem to happen too fast or in a stupid way. (Which can happen, expecially when a developer is lazy.)Some really funny references to other media (mostly japanese or online stuff) that really shows the developers know there stuff.Some really great art for the most part. (some of the backgrounds and male characters look a bit off but nothing distracting.)Really solid from a technical standpoint, at least in my case. No bugs or CtD's or anything like that, which can happen, even with Visual Novels made specifically for PC. They really put in the effort here.A really good if not large soundtrack!Cons:They could have spent more time in QA. There are several voice lines that are spoken incorrectly or the voice actors let there accents slip near the end of sentences. This isn't an insult to the voice actors, from there work in game to what I have heard on there patreon they are some of the very few western voice actors that seem to have passion for there work. Also some of the lines in game have some errors but the amount is small. (Less than half a dozen.)Now this might put some people off but I really urge you to reconsider, this is a con but one that could and most likely will be rectified by the developers in future. The game ends but the story doesn't really. The game is actually 4 chapters of ACE Academy. They finished these 4 chapters and left them open to return to later while they develop another game.[Minor Spoiler] One thing I don't particularly like but doesn't come up very often is the fact that they are in Japan and the voice actors are speaking English. Yet as it turns out they are meant to be speaking Japanese basically the whole time. I would have thought they could just get Seiyuus for this instead of getting English voice actors (like another company has done before.) It is to me at least, cringe worthy. But like I said it doesn't come up very often and from what I know of the developers they didn't have any shady intentions behind doing so (like some marketing trash to ""reach out to a wider audience"". Yeah I'm talking about you Moe Novel you pieces of human filth :D)So in closing, if you like romance stories, a good slice of life (good because its not boring :P) and some mecha thrown in, this is a great little VN for you!I would highly recommend you check out there patreon and there next game! You can support them and get the first chapter of that starting in Q1 2017. As well as voting on what could be in that game (romance choices and origin stories etc, which on a side note was done for this game. Only two people were romanceable in this at first but the devs put in more after feedback on there patreon.)			"

								God Damn that was a wild ride, but amazing. I had a lot of fun playing it and i'm sure everyone else did too, anyways here are my thoughts.Where do I begin. This was nothing short of a masterpiece, it was fun, energetic, and really made me want to keep going without stop. I got this game from my cousin who likes these games and gifts the ones she truly enjoys to me, but unfortunately I already bought the game, but never played it so I decided to and i'm not going to lie this was an adventure. The voice acting was spot on, Character models were fantastic, and the girls were phenominal (Mei should have been a choice honestly, she seemed like it would be an amazing experience). All in all this game was tremendous, I can't state that enough. Spectacular job Devs please make more soon.10/10 ACE ACADEMY: SUPERNOVA ;)			"

								Not one the best of VN's that I have played, but it was definitely one of the nicer ones later on in the story. I did enjoy the start, up until the 3rd choice that you have in the story, “WTF” being one of the options kind of put me off a bit and it took me out of the story. It caught me really off guard in a bad way; I was beginning to feel like I might have waited the money for this game. A good amount the abbreviations for your choices put me off, and some just not giving me a good idea of what I thought they would say. Some of them seemed a little childish at times, the wording of the choices or how it was in all caps, I felt like if I would have chosen them your player character would have acted just….like a child? Like for instance “AT LEAST YOU HAVE A MOM” Is not quality writing for a option to choice from. But later on in the story at one point with the Player characters sister, I got a little emotional and somewhat adapted to the way the choices where written, I was still a little put off by some of them, but not as much early on, overall, I started to really enjoy it and I was glad that I kept playing when I wanted to stop.

Almost on the scale of the Alicesoft Games.I'm about 3 hours in and I'm already hook. The characters are neat, the story while not fresh is told entirely from a new perspective (the foreign student angle) and can be quite entertaining and the VA does a great job of selling the illusion of this new world (I really like Nikki's and Valerie).Still trying to pick a Waifu but I have a feeling I'm going to go for all the routes. Please go and give this game a try, the developers more then earned their keep with this.			"

								I was wary because most western-made visual novels I've played have been weak (in art, story, and writing), however it's been anything but. It feels more like an extremely well-localized high quality Japanese game (if not slightly better in some areas).Best bits: hilariously (and thankfully) forgiving quick-time-y segments, great english voices, fun story, no teenage boy self-loathing.

Early Access Review
								I didn't know what to expect out of this game, (especially when I found out recently it had a KickStarter project under the name of Kendo Crush) but I decided to give it a try because it was part of an anime-centric sale. I like to say it was a good investment for Ace Academy held my attention by the end of the demo.Rarely do you get a fully english Visual Novel, and it feels a bit more interesting to me than a regular japanese subbed one. It probably helps that all the characters are well voiced and that you can hear how well they suit their characters. Like Shou Shinjirou, the male best friend. If I didn't know better, I'd say he sounded like Yuri Lowenthall (particularly Yosuke from Persona 4). And it feels fun to hang out with him despite the obvious dating sim with other girls, if only because he seems to have his own romance subplot that you can either help out in or watch from the distance as he remains oblivious.In fact, the whole slice-of-life story is quite enjoyable with all the characters. You have the cute but at times annoying younger sister, the laid back uncle, and the kind and popular ace Ace pilot. And then you have a bunch of girls that you can date; there's the mean captain with a soft side, a smart and shy support with an obvious crush on Shou, the shameless flirt of an engineer, a kind stickler to the rules manager, and possibly a friendly rival to the captain but with bad history. As vague as those descriptions are, that's the gist of the cast.It's actually hard for me to pick which one girl to follow at first, because they're all likeable in their own way. They have layers to them that only through extended hang-out sessions can you see and also realize in how to nurture your friendship with them. Of course, I might have cheated because there's a ""rollback"" system, or at least being able to load to an earlier save or autosave file before picking a different option. And the music is top notch. The instrumental version of the trailer song as you load it up is very catchy and seems to capture the general feel of the game. Upbeat and awesome.Of course, I wish the game would make some changes for the full release. While the slice-of-life aspects are fun, I have little to no understanding of the world lore, despite the little sprinkled in class scenes talking about Gears. Gears are a big deal in the world; there are even movies and TV shows that are like ours but have the world Gear in them; That 70's Gear, The Gear of Thrones, The Lord of the Gears...We hear so much about Gears on a technical scale from their tools to their weapons, including the safe ""recreational"" ones. And yet at the same time don't know a thing. They're a common thing in this world, have their own toy line, and yet there doesn't seem to be any sort of big scale robot war with them. Why do college students have to fight each other? Why are there sponsors for so many pilot teams? What's the benefit of being a Gear Pilot? What do Gear Pilots do when they graduate? It's not like we have Gears of our own in our world so it would help to get some context. It can't be exactly as the same as running tanks or planes because we don't use those to beat the snot out of each other.And what's more, I like to agree with the general consensus that the fast reaction time keys of WASD is kind of bland for what I'd expect in a visual novel with actual gameplay. For the first few matches I wasn't even sure if I was doing something right because there were two points where the gameplay elements screwed with you; first was when you had no weapons and could only dodge and block as your HP dwindled down and your enemy was completely fine (not to mention you couldn't even choose the action; it was automatic after pressing the button indicated). Then there was a match where you DID have weapons, but you got your scrap♥♥♥♥♥kicked anyway because the weapons weren't calibrated. I thought it was another mistake based on the weapons I could choose (and you only get to choose once in this Early Access, between three sets of guns and three sets of swords).They were all story-based defeats that meant to drive the plot a bit more, but I thought I was actually doing something wrong. There was little to no explanation in how to fight other that ""use the weapons at the right time"". But you don't get to chose to go all sword akimbo because the 4 button commands change it every time. You have no control of your protagonist's Gear so it feels less like a cool robot fight and more like a game of slap the coin before your opponent does.My suggestion is that if there is going to be fighting that incorporates the swords, guns, thrusters and shields, let the player make their own choices. Make into rock-paper-scissors, kind of like Fate/EXTRA. There are four buttons, so each one can make a command. Gun beats Sword, Sword beats Thrusters, and Thrusters beats Gun, with the Shield command as an all purpose guard. You still take damage, but not as much as if you got hit with the wrong counter. Still, I was hooked until the end of the 3rd Episode; where it literally ended on a rather tense cliffhanger. Up until then, there wasn't any sense of drama or tension aside from school related problems, and most of those were easily resolved in time. But I think after all the build-up and introduction that there might be a change in the story, as well as an answer to most of the question I listed here.Ace Academy is a very fun game. I would have kept playing until the end and/or got bored if possible. I'm not sure if I can recommend this to anyone, but I certainly enjoyed running at least 5 and a half hours in it. It sounds short, but with a lot of choices to build your camaraderie and possible love interest, as well as some hidden choices depending if you picked a strong, smart, or charasmatic build when you start the game, it has the potential to go on even longer by the time it goes full access. I personally can't wait to play more of this game/			"

								ACE Academy is a visual novel that I hold very dear to me. Lets get on with the pros and cons Pros  Realisitic- This game actually gave me decisions that I would of said the exact same thing in which was kind of freaky. Comedy- I had many good laughs with all the characters as well as when you, your uncle Kaito and Niki decide to watch a movie they all have hints towards the tv shows they mimic. Voicing- I love that there is full english voice acting for the most part with the non-playable characters except for maybe a single line I noticed that wasn't voiced. Characters- All the characters are interesting and their is even two characters who have feelings for someone other than the MC I know this is a rare occurence in Visual Novels. Free Choices- For the most part you always have multiple decisions and there is replay ability.Cons Incomplete- This shouyld get resolved since the game is in Early Access. Minor Grammar Issues- I'm no grammar whiz ,but I noticed a few weird sentences.SummaryOverall, I love this game and I have high hopes for it ,but I need episode 4 to come so I can continue to pursue Valerie as the best girl XD "

								I wasn't really looking for  a game like this but it was on sale so I read the description and told myself: give it a try!That was no mistake. I was taken in a game with, in my opinion, good voice actors for the most part and at least 2 minigames. I really enjoy games where relationships are very important (Persona etc.) and this game did no let me down. There are some cases where what I could do in the game where not what I would've done but there were still a lot of choices not too different from mine in mind. And I should not forget the laughs I sometimes had. Basically just give it a try. I did not finish the game as it is right now and there is still more to come, but I had games I payed a lot more for and they weren't as good as this. Even if I would have already finished it I would not feel bad about spending the money on a game I played nearly 6 hours while having fun doing so.EDIT:After having played through the complete game once I feel like saying they definitively did a very good job. The ending of the game did not feel rushed and it took me a few hours just for the last episode. It is my favourite VN till now. Sometimes I felt like playing Clannad (hello train of emotions). I also found all the connections and references great. A very good VN I really liked and haven't played the last time			"

												The most fun visual novel i ever played, already looking forward to the next visual novel from PixelFade Studio. The art is good the story is fun and english voiceovers that are very good make it an enjoyable read and make it way more fun for me. I will say tho, that i wished the story would continue someday, either in a sequel or extra dlc, but yeah i'm looking forward to anything from pixelfade to be honest :).			"

								I haven't played all the way through but I am more then familiar with visual novels and what we have here is pretty impressive. Almost on the scale of the Alicesoft Games.I'm about 3 hours in and I'm already hook. The characters are neat, the story while not fresh is told entirely from a new perspective (the foreign student angle) and can be quite entertaining and the VA does a great job of selling the illusion of this new world (I really like Nikki's and Valerie).Still trying to pick a Waifu but I have a feeling I'm going to go for all the routes. Please go and give this game a try, the developers more then earned their keep with this.			"

								Ususally My reviews are very small things that I write mostly saying ""This is a fun game"" or something similar. I feel like this game deserves better.ACE Accademy is a Slice of Life / Romance / Giant robot fighting Visual Novel (A game in which the primary aspect of Gameplay is dialogue). If you watch Anime you'll feel right at home. However, You don't have to love VNs or Anime to enjoy this. It's a wonderful game all on its own.The basic plots is this: Your character and your (adorable) little sister move to Japan to live with your (awesome) Uncle. You've transfered into ACE Accademy, a school that teaches people to work with GEARS. Giant robot suits that we fight for sport. You join a team consisting of a great cast of characters, your romance options and a loveable goof. Not all of them are introduced right off the bat but your choices are: A shy girl, A nice girl, A flirty girl, and a... quick tempered girl. They aren't that simple though, each character is deep and very interesting, with their own quirks and flaws.The romance is very well done, quite adorable, and a huge draw for me. However, if that's not your thing, this game still has content for you. The main content is just as well made as the romance subplots.The game is full of funny moments and interesting character development. It also has a lot of pop culture references, which while entertaining, we'll have to see how well they age. Even if they don't age well though, this will still be a great game.The game has a bit of exta gameplay in the form of combat which they described as trying to be ""DDR like"", but they've recently stated that they're going to redesign combat in general.This brings me to my penultimate point: The game is still under development, so the end isn't known yet. But I have high hopes for it. Parts are going to change, and I don't know what E4 will look like, but everything up till now has been incredible.Finally I'd like to say that this game has become my new go to VN to recommend to people who want to try out the genere. It's easily accesable, funny, fun, mixes things up a little, has a great cast, great art, basically it's over all a great starting point.			"

								I wasn't really looking for  a game like this but it was on sale so I read the description and told myself: give it a try!That was no mistake. I was taken in a game with, in my opinion, good voice actors for the most part and at least 2 minigames. I really enjoy games where relationships are very important (Persona etc.) and this game did no let me down. There are some cases where what I could do in the game where not what I would've done but there were still a lot of choices not too different from mine in mind. And I should not forget the laughs I sometimes had. Basically just give it a try. I did not finish the game as it is right now and there is still more to come, but I had games I payed a lot more for and they weren't as good as this. Even if I would have already finished it I would not feel bad about spending the money on a game I played nearly 6 hours while having fun doing so.EDIT:After having played through the complete game once I feel like saying they definitively did a very good job. The ending of the game did not feel rushed and it took me a few hours just for the last episode. It is my favourite VN till now. Sometimes I felt like playing Clannad (hello train of emotions). I also found all the connections and references great. A very good VN I really liked and haven't played the last time			"

								while I love the story I wish the gameplay was more then a simple clicking game I feel as tho this could become it's own stand alone full length rpg that could rival persona in my eyes it has alot of potential and I am glad I caught tail wind of it but I would find it so much more cool with having to actually manage the games like weapons repairs on Egale and well as give it more time in the whole school aspect cause I was interested on hoe to interact with all characters it just seemed rush and so far the ending made me a bit upset do to there are still so many questions un answered Like I said earlier I feel like this game has a lot of potential I even see how you could have the mech fights a little more interactive altho I do like how you can do stratagey or go on your own but again feels somewhat limited altho all in all loved the game and the references and if you guys wanted to push this game to go further maybe make it a full on jrpg you would have at least one supporter idk if anyone else agrees but I can't wait to see what you do with the rest of it cause hopefully (episode 4 isn't the end)			"

												I'm loving everything about the game so far and can't wait to see how it turns out!  My heart did die a little at the cliffhanger ending though.  One thing that comes to mind is that I wish there was a speech log, that or I was too immersed or dumb to find it.Full Version Update: I thoroughly enjoyed this VN in its entirety.  With the complete version, routes averaged about 10 hours (including breaks for food and drink) for me.  The characters are likable and there are plenty of humorous elements mixed in with the suspenseful questions surrounding your GEAR's core.  I may not be experienced with many VNs but this is one I am definitely glad to have in my library.			"

								As far as visual novels go this is the best I've played.  Normally i'd say read but this company includes so many decisions that ACTUALLY CHANGE THE STORY that I can actually say ""Played"" I was skepticle about paying so much for a VN and may not have risked picking it up if it wasn't on sale but im really glad i did and I will for any future projects from PixleFade.Notes:English voice acted (except for your character and a few lines here and there they dont have in place, im assuming will be fixed after early access is done. At the time of reviewing they just released the final chapter today? yesterday? anyway they just finished the ""Game"" so polish comes now i assume)Tons of choices -including 3 romance options if thats your thingNo H scenes- sorry Broseph try Nekopara.Replayability - the main story can change slightly with your decisions but the real branching path is the three different romance options as well as you can choose one of three ""traits"" for your character at the start, this affects how you can react to certian situations which is a neat touch.TLDR Its worth the price, you actullay affect the game world with your choices, they are not purely for your roleplaying.

Found only 2 drawbacks personally....  1. some of the character voices sounded strange (possibly because its the first ive played with spoken english rather than just subs but you can turn voices off if you so wish.  and 2. the ending almost felt like they rushed it a little. other than that its a great game that i would highly recommend.  :Doverall 8/10 from me =)			"

												Probably the most enjoyable VN I've played of those available on Steam. Please disregard the time played, I've gone through multiple runs and gotten 90% of the content, but for some reason my timer is stuck on 44 mins.The big draw for me is that you get to make lots of choices throughout the game; a lot of them are minor dialogue changes only, but there are enough more substantial ones mixed in to keep it engaging. You keep making choices until the very end, unlike a lot of VNs where you pick your route in the the first quarter of the game and then spend the rest of it reading without any further input. Being able to choose your characters reaction to events, even innocuous ones, also helps from the common pitfall of a main character thats thoughts don't reflect your own like the common dense and or self absorbed VN protagonist.The game isn't perfect; I feel like the robot battles were a bit underutilised, and the without going into spoilers the pacing felt a little off at times, especially when something fairly significant happens in your first big match and then you kind of just go on with day to day life and aren't given the option to investigate further until the rest of the plot catches up. These are minor points, but if there is a sequel or even a seperate VN by the same group, it'd be good to see these worked on. The ending also fell a bit flat for me, it really felt like the game had just hit its halfway point.Otherwise there is a lot to like here. The characters are all walking archetypes, but thats not such a bad thing in a product like this. They're all likable and engaging and none of the routes (such as they are, though its more a case of getting extra and more involved events with the girl of your choice while the main story continues than actual routes) felt like they were unnatural. I also really liked the fact that depending on your interaction or lack thereof with some characters they would grow and have relationships of their own, which you could also encourage or not. This was a really nice touch; doesn't it always seem weird in these games that your character is the only one looking for love and everyone else is in stasis until you set your eyes on them? ACE Academy neatly avoided that pitfall.The artstyle is functional. I don't mean that dismissively, it does the job but it isn't as high quality as some other VN's. It's never bad though, and theres a reasonable quality bump in the more important scenes. The voice work is surprisingly solid, with a few very good performances in Nikki and Valerie, but no one really stands out as bad. Lots of little references and nods towards other media entities (Japanese and otherwise) as well for those of you who like spotting things like that.All in all I liked this a lot and was sad when it ended. I'll definitely keep an eye out for further releases from this company and recommend it to anyone who's in the mood for a VN with some dating, some light robots and a lot more input than your standard VN.Also Yuuna best girl but only because dating your sister would be weird.

								While this game is not finished yet, the depth of each character involved are good enough to keep me in my seat until the next update comes. I really enjoy how the developer handles character development and how they introduces them. Each are unique and have their own memorable traits.In terms of other VN, it is definitely not a kinetic one since most choices leads to new scenes that can leave readers sitting for hours making multiple saves at every choices. What I enjoyed most is the interactive battle scene, although simple, it can reinvigorate readers from the norm reading(unless you're an avid reader and don't mind texts).The OST, although simple, gives the perfect vibe for every scene it plays, giving the readers a lucid experience on the scene occuring. A few of the soundtrack does catches my attention, especially during the battle scene where it kept my me on my toe and few touching scene that helps me indulge the background storyline.In terms of art, it is an eye candy and easily score 8/10. I hoped that there will be more gallery pictures featuring the characters doing their pastimes or just hanging out.I have played few VN, and I won't say I'm an expert. Hell, I played a lot but only finishes about 2 to 3 VN. Just because I don't know cooking, doesn't mean that  I can't say one's a good cook. I would definitely recommend fellow readers to take a moment to consider if you wanted a simple but rich story, then you have come to the right place.			"

												Decently crafted visual novel that creates illusion of choise, set in a world where some people pursue career of mecha piloting for commercial and entertainment/gladiatorial sector, instead the standard military path most stories take.ACE Academy is fully english voice acted visual novel that manages to do something rare : Not to get me vomiting when I hear the voice acting ( exclude one person, that seems to have bit different recording method than others,hurting the quality,  you will notice it when you get there).Overally it's an on rails story with fake choises that add flavour to the game, you more or less meet most of the non specific events on all routes and only major choise you have to do is to pick who you favour the most, setting your specific relationship routes to stone.Biggest downside to this game is that while most of the charecters are adequetly different overally it has no difference in the story, ending is essentially same on every path you take no matter what you do, also all choises you think will matter do not overally do anything.Never the less, this game is an ok single or double read story, if some of the charecters spark your interest to merit further reading, also messing with ""little sister"" is always fun.It's one of the games I'd like to lean on the "" midway"" vote area if possible, but I'd say the good english voice acting tips it to positive.Pick it up if you are interested in non japanese visual novel that has that Japanese vibe, you won't miss ""original"" voice acting as this game was made in Canada ( I belive in Toronto).

												Most people would call this a dating simulator, but I'll go a different route and call this an anime simulator; anyone familiar with modern anime will be able to spot influences and archetypes with ease. It's practically it's own meta. I started to groan when I saw the store involved mechs, but they are fairly inconsiquential to the plot; it could have been about eSports (a better one than that free one that's out there) and wouldn't have been effected that much. A very light-hearted romance VN that feels stunted by an anti-climactic ending, but as someone making a VN, I can definitely understand you can only do so much at once.			"

The characters I think everyone can like, and with the different developments in these characters they seem scarily life-like. Even if they're just 2-D images.There have been many instances in this game where I have had to keep myself from laughing too hard, I swear if I had to hear another scene from 'Nikki Vs. Kaito' I would've probably had to restrain myself.But, for those of you who like a good story, with likeable characters, amazing moments and great art, look no further than ACE Academy.I'm looking forward to PixelFade's next work			"

												Decently crafted visual novel that creates illusion of choise, set in a world where some people pursue career of mecha piloting for commercial and entertainment/gladiatorial sector, instead the standard military path most stories take.ACE Academy is fully english voice acted visual novel that manages to do something rare : Not to get me vomiting when I hear the voice acting ( exclude one person, that seems to have bit different recording method than others,hurting the quality,  you will notice it when you get there).Overally it's an on rails story with fake choises that add flavour to the game, you more or less meet most of the non specific events on all routes and only major choise you have to do is to pick who you favour the most, setting your specific relationship routes to stone.Biggest downside to this game is that while most of the charecters are adequetly different overally it has no difference in the story, ending is essentially same on every path you take no matter what you do, also all choises you think will matter do not overally do anything.Never the less, this game is an ok single or double read story, if some of the charecters spark your interest to merit further reading, also messing with ""little sister"" is always fun.It's one of the games I'd like to lean on the "" midway"" vote area if possible, but I'd say the good english voice acting tips it to positive.Pick it up if you are interested in non japanese visual novel that has that Japanese vibe, you won't miss ""original"" voice acting as this game was made in Canada ( I belive in Toronto).

												Like this game?Be sure to check out PixelFade's latest project!https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2081517796/crystalline-visual-novel-gameIt's pretty cool!What a stunning game!I am not one for ‘Dating Sims’. But I flipping love this game!Let’s do a quick run through shall we? Visuals: They are Good; with consistent quality.Some are overused a bit too much, but I didn’t mind.They can be a bit too… shall we say; over anime.I like anime but some of the drawings were not quite my styleCheck the pictures. You like? Good! Gameplay: Slick; but mostly regular Visual Novel stuff.Does add some extra stuff that keeps it interesting.Lots of choices!I really like the freedom. Even after you have made a decision, you can scroll back and make it again. Sound:  Music: Original score is good. Once again of consistent quality.Enjoyable. Voice Acting: This is an interesting one.I would not have enjoyed this game as much, were it not voice acted. (I don’t think I would have bought it either)However, the quality of the VA is - I feel - inconsistent.It is not bad; just not quite right, a lot of the time.Important to note: I am an amateur, Sound Engineer and, Film Director/Editor; So maybe it was just fussy me :PAmateur = Unpaid (but at a professional level)	:(I do enjoy the occasional visual novel. But I really just thought meh when I saw this game, I bought it on a whim when it was on a 50% off sale.It took me 10 hours to play through this game once. In three nights! I stayed up till 4AM every time!Worth it!I gotta tell you I think it is worth full price.Yuuna is best Girl!Fite me!			"

								First off, it should be known that I am an advid VN reader, and have read well over a few hundred different titles, some of which are the most prolific in the industry. Next thing you should know is that I am incredibly picky with what VNs I even consider reading. Now that that is out of the way, to the review itself.This VN is an incredibly quirky and funny story about a guy who ends up moving to Japan, for reasons that are hinted at in the story (As of the time of this review, only episode 2 has been released). The charecters that you are to interact with throughtout the game are at first glance set into one troupe or onother, but quickly begin to get depth to them. The amount of dialogue options in the game give it a very personal and individual experience, something many other VNs in the industry lack, stacked on top of being able to name the main charecter and give him a strength allow for one of the best experiences I have had to date.The actual layout, structure, and the pacing of the game are all very well thought out. Nothing feels rushed, events don't just happen out of the blue, and it has a very authentic atmosphere. All in all, I consider this one of the games I am looking forward to the most in the coming year. If you are someone who has an interest in NVs but has always been scared away, I have confidance that this is one of the best games to get into the industry. I personally started with Fate Stay Night, and have no qualms about putting the this game right there with it. This was worth every penny, and is looking to be one of the best VNs I have had the plessure of reading. 10/10			"

								Ok iv played a few VNs and this is one of my favs.im just say it feels real even if the year is in 2049 it feel like ""yea i see that happing"". Now i have more then 20+ being a backer and  im just say iv never backed anything i did it on a whim and it was wroth it the Devs lisen to what there fans have to say which is big for a crowd funded game.SETTING: so the football was manly made to throw back and forth and look what it turned in to. seeing a mech go from milltary to factory work then its own sport isnt to far off  it feels like a thing that can happen in the near future. The MCs story is belivable, the people he interacts with are also, and its not to future-e yaknow.MC(main character): he is you and you are him i would say it makes sense most VNs your reading someone eles story here your making his or your for that matter. I feel like im making choices i would make if i want to be a♥♥♥♥♥i will or nice i will you as the MC has power if that makes sense.summary: i love it the game is worth the price seeing as there is still 2 eps still to come out characters are fun and funny ahem nikki, the gameplay is pretty fun given all you use is WASD it just silly in a good way its simple so story can flow  the town in which you live has histroy, 4 girls to try and get plus a funny uncle 8/10 nikkisthis was a short review i dont make many so if its badly formatted sorry add and dyslexic XD			"

												I usually don't write reviews, but I got off my lazy butt for once (figuratively of course as I am writing the review on my pc), because this game deserves more publicity and love!I have played quite a few VN's and while I am by no means knowledgeable about the subject in general I am sure of one thing and that is that this VN is excellent, nigh on perfect for me! One of the best, if not the best VN I have ever played. At first I was unimpressed, the logo, while nice seemed very similar to other VN's and anime so I just put into my wishlist and waited for a sale or if I ever really wanted to play it, but what cought my eye was the english dubbing. At first I was reluctant, because I very much enjoy japanese dubbing, VN's and anime are usually just not right without it, but here, its almost perfect. It adds realism to the characters and makes them seem much more real, not only because I understand them (lol :D) but because Japanese voice overs tend to be a little bit unreal in terms of voice squeakiness. I loved just about all the characters and their VA's, they are well placed and do a good job, if there is anything to criticise about this, it is that the volume and clarity of the voice dips from character to character at times (Uncle Kaito, as hilarious as he is, he is somewhat muddy (?) I guess, not the VA's fault tho, I am sure) but that might be just me or my pc/laptop. The art is great, vibrant and pleasant (altho Mayu cg pictures look very different from her sprite :D) and the music is outstanding, landing the situation proper umpf! when needed. The overarching story is a bit weak, while I was not expecting actual investigation or anything, it was wrapped up very quickly, not badly mind you, just very quickly. But honestly I do not mind at all, the ""main"" story was there just to pave way for the everyday life and the interactions, and it did that splendidly.Another thing that pleasantly surprised me, is that your friends have lifes even outside of you, which is very unusual. Normally in vn's or rom simulators interesting things happen only when MC is around, but here, if you are not spending time with certain people, they still have the same experience, you are just not there and only hear about it later. Girls start dating or have crush on other guys, they get more involved in their work or hobbies etc. its very cool to see and it does not happen very often in other games of this kind. Altho I do have to say I do not appreaciate my anyone getting close to my precious little imouto, that is something that needs to be fixed next time around! :DI have only two more things to say, firstly, with the budget and staff that pixelfade has available, what they did is nothing short of miraculous. You guys do not need to worry about black sprites or whatever, the enjoyment  you have out of this VN is immidiately obvious and it transfers right onto the player. And secondly, this VN is hilarious, I laughed out loud so many times at the small nods and weeby things from both cultures, it was just a blast. Embarassed Kaori si still amazing :D (And I generally dislike tsunderes!) So thank you and to everyone who likes VN's and does not have this one yet, GO GET IT! Yes, that is an order (altho you do not actually need to go out to get it, just click buy)Now, STOP. BEING.A.PERVERT(S). and give us Crystalline :)			"

								What are the odds that I watch the old anime feature length movie ""Akira"", check Steam, find Ace Academy, buy and play it and then find out that two of the characters are named after people in that same movie?!?That was eerily cool for me. Anyway, as far as anime visual novels go, my verdict is yes. The voice acting is good, the characters are interesting, the feels are reals, and the replayability is high. It has given me many grins and laughs. It's very enjoyable.Bad side is the very basic quick time events during battle. It's just click the right key out of the WASD sequence. Game takes up about 1.4 GBs. Game has me hooked. I like it.			"

												A great step for an indie company, taking steps into the western visual novel scene. Not too long making it a good starting place for people new to the genere. Writing is primarily comedic but can be serious if it wants too. It does get a little cringy at times, but its all part of the charm. Some people say that all the character routes are the same, but this is only true in a very loose sense - with all characters following a similar emotional arc (like the route always starts happy, has a hiccup in it, then its all better in the end) but the characters are noticably differant.The addition of timed events add a little extra spice to the game, but is nothing particualary new in amoungst VNs but it is used a fair amount in the story. This being good/bad is basiclly personal preferance.7 or 8/10 A good breath of fresh air and I would advocate supporting it just so that western developers take visual novels more seriously.			"

												I've played my fair share of Visual Novels and I have to say, this is one of the best Western developed ones out there. It's fully voiced (in English no less!) and has a great cast of characters that are all brought to life by the writers and actors.It's also possibly one of the funniest VN's I've played. A lot of in jokes and pop culture references that really hit the mark. The one down side I have is the ending, it feels like it pops up out of nowhere and I get that the devs needed to finish at some point becuase of limited funds, but it feels like I've just spend 8 hours getting to know these characters and then there is no closure with any of them. ACE Academy is a wonderful VN, and I truly hope there is a sequel to come.			"

								Having finally completed episode four, I can say with absolute certainty that this is a fantastic and wonderfully-made visual novel.  With giant robots!There are a number of technical glitches, of course, the most notable being that there are several lines of audio in episodes 3 and 4 that either don't play to the wording or simply don't play at all.  However, looking beyond those, this is definitely a game worth playing.  All combat and decisions (including some VERY emotional ones) are based on choices, including quick-time events!  And all characters, both human and giant robot, bring a life and energy to the game.  And just when you think it can't get any better?  It does.All in all, I highly recommend this game to anyone who's a fan of visual novels, anime and manga, and especially of mech battles.  Every moment of this game is electric, hilarious, moving, or any combination of the three.  I wouldn't change a thing about it, and in fact, I think I'll play it again!			"

												This game is great, I loved the story even tho it did end in a weird place. I would recommend it for people who want a game to kill some time, but not for people who want excellent qualty. alot of things in the story is predecided so if you choose diffrent paths it will still lead to the same outcome. But the comedy is great and if you want to have fun i do recommend this game. Plus at the end of the game you still have a gallery and you most likely will have some unkown to go back and complete.

The artwork is nice, the music is soothing and well fitting, and the current voice acting is pretty nice even with slight bugs here and there. Overall i enjoyed the unique story-telling and design of Ace. It really captures the moment for me and i found the dialogue choices and few gameplay choices help make this early access game stand out.I'm looking forward to the further development of this game. :)			"

												God damn. This game gave me the chills. It made my choices feel important when they needed to be. Plucked my heartstrings like a lute in ESO!I love this game. Not gonna lie. Every nerdy joke, anime reference, etc would have me in tears. There were SO MANY hilarious moments I just couldn't not keep this game in my heart. Feels good to have completed it as well, but also kind of sad it ended. Of course, I can keep playing and playing to find every little nook and cranny that I missed in this game, follow the other romance routes, etc. My first run through took me about 8 hours, which is the time I currently have in at the time of writing this. I'll try not to make this review too long, but man this game is like a SUPERNOVA!!!!!!I seriously rank this a 10/10 personally. I would rank it a 9/10 for not being that long of a game if you were to only play once :P but, I am not THAT savage. I followed this game back when it was still Kendo Crush, but it was reworked to not have a VA for the main, as well as being in a college rather than a high school. Good times those were, but to see this game finally finished, it kinda brings a tear to my eye. PixelFade Studio, if you are reading this, Congratulations on a successful release! I practically fall in love with anime or games that pluck a few heart strings, and you guys did just that. I look forward to ANY of your future products! This gamer, is one heck of a happy camper. Literally. :PThe rest of this is a spoiler so caution is advised:I died of laughter from the Fullmetal Alchemist reference during the training session. 10/10 I won't spoil anything further because I know some people want to be spoiled :PIn all seriousness, Buy this game. Experience it. Your choices in the game may be drastically different than mine. Maybe they are the EXACT SAME somehow. I'll never know. Yuuna is waifu of the year though :P			"

												So I am going to start off with the fact I have only played 1 of the routes so far, Kaori route, keep that in mind while reading this review I plan to play more and will update if I feel the need for change.----------------------Wow! I want to start by saying this game blew away my expectations as a western VN from a first time indie dev team! I will say I really liked the game, I was suprised by the clear thought and care going into the characters. I will also add that the fact the game was voice acted first bothered me but I grew to like most voice acting of the game, I will say how ever some voice actresses are clearly more practiced then others some of the quality ranges greatly. Okay onto details.Pros-Good refreshing storyHigh Replayability Multiple different routes to takeGood cast of charactersPretty quality art----Needs improvement-Story ended kind of abruptly, leaves me hoping this will get a sequel of some sortIt felt some scenes were wrote to have CG where there is no CGNormally priced at 20$ and I know some fans don't do more than 1 route. Game lasted 8 hours---(Bad? I don't want to call it bad T_T)Some reuse of backgrounds and other assets can be distracting, such as the lobby of the hotel being the same as the company's wait area you visit or other such reused assets (nit picky I know)Felt this game lacked CGs (I know I am spoiled)Again the length of this game really hurt it I wish it was 2 hours or so longer for the route I played, it doesn't feel that resolved.----Verdict, I really enjoyed the game but I got it on sale on a whim for 10$ and I don't know how much I could truly reccomend it for 20$. I really want to support this new dev team and would like to reccomend it to anyone who finds it interesting. If anything this shows great promise as a first time project to this new dev team! If I play more and for some reason feel the need to update this I will but as of Jan 2. 2017 this is current.			"

												First of all, Ace Academy ruined my life, please buy it.Source: I GOT INTO THIS VISUAL NOVEL DURING ITS EARLY ACCESS PHASE AND AM NEARING ONE HUNDRED HOURS AND COUNTING, WHAT THE ACTUAL HELLSecond of all, Ending's right garbage, but that's not the meat and potatoes of Ace Academy - which are, without a doubt, the myriad of character interactions and scene variations that make this a Visual Novel to be replayed over and over again.Third of all, Valerie is best girl, with Yuuna as a close second. Kaori's pretty neat, but Mayu can suck eggs for all I care.As the resident shill of Ace Academy, I will most likely purchase a copy for the person I'm shilling to, that's how good I believe it is - and on that note, be on the lookout for Crystalline, PixelFade's next Visual Novel built as a vast improvement to Ace Academy that is promised to have an actual ending (releasing ~Q1 2017 in the same episodic format as Ace Academy was).If not, all the blame can go to Dishu.The writer's pretty neat as well, I guess.

												like sunrider, but with questionable voice acting work that makes emotional scenes feel far more like a b movie than they should, combat scenes with only one right choice, and character routes that essentially end as they start. i personally would have preferred less heroines with more development than several with the barest minimum.

												I usually don't review games, especially ones that i have yet to complete. However, even with only a few hours under my belt this game is exceptional. It has a ton of references to pop culture that always managed to get a smile out of me and had great character development (at least for the girl i chose). The story is interesting and hours will dissappear without you knowing where they went. Unlike most visual novels, there are a plethora of choices as well as implications for said choices which is quite refreshing.TLDR; Caught this game on a sale but after playing i would recommend even if it wasn't on sale! 9/10UPDATE: Ending left a sour taste in my mouth. It was promising at the beginning but the ending fell completely flat. I enjoyed the ride but i can't give it such a wonderful review with how it ended. UPDATED SCORE: 6/10			"

												This is a pretty decent visual novel.  I think its strongest point is its humour, the characters are quite funny.  The story is also interesting, I'm looking forward to what's going to happen in further episodes.  Having to respond in seconds brought in some excitement, although I was hoping for just a little more interaction in the mecha fights, maybe more strategic choices, not just finding the right button.The game's only big fault is that it feels slightly unfinished.  I think showing silhouettes is even worse than not showing the minor side characters at all.  (Not to mention one thing I've never understood in VN's: in public places, why are there no people in the background?)  And it's an even bigger problem that there were small errors in the consequences in my choices, for example with the girls I dated the least it would immediately jump to the second or third one, and I had to figure out some information out of the context.  I also had information repeated, or some information I've received would not change the behaviour of the MC.  And there were a few typos.  I want to be clear about that the plot flows well most of the time, but there are occasional glitches.If the minor side characters get drawn, and the plot glitches get fixed, then I'll be very happy to replay this game.

												Unfinished game.The game is a great idea and good story but they cut it short cause they are cheap.  With the amount of money spent on this they could have made it so much longer as I have played cheaper games not as nice but have gone on longer than this one.Lots of recycled art, black screens with no art and other ""we are cheap so save the money for ourselves not our customers"" type♥♥♥♥♥♥br>There is a great game here if they just finish it.  So don't pay full price, wait till it's on sale reall cheap too since it's an unfinished game it's not worth more than $10. "

												I started ""Ace Academy"" thinking it was going to be a simple game and experience; but 5 minutes into the game my assumptions couldn't have been further from the truth. ""Ace Academy"" is a one in a kind experience. It's funny, heartbreaking, and not afraid to take chances. Where many routes dont seem to affect the story in anyway there are still many choices that provide extra or different dialoge and allow you to further immerse yourself into the RPG experience which was a well done twist on visual novels. During my play through I focused on the Valerie route and was sucked into an emotionally fulfilling story between to students. This story was full of laughter and sly comments, but lets not forget about the real reason we play these types of games. Yes, the romance. Honestly fellas (and gals) this games romance was not lacking in any sence. I was immensely pleased how they allowed the dialoge to play out giving the player different options on serious or joking comments and event gave to opportunity to make physical choices as well. Every character had their own unique personality and makes you fall inlove with them. Even Shou, the well known comic relief is an amazing character shaping the story. I can't wait to play this game again and see what other choices I can make and how the story changes. Overall a great experience and a well recommended game in my mind.			"

												""Welcome to the ACE Academy pilot"" They said.. Trust me, they were right. You find yourself sucked into the ofthe story. This game is just FREAKING AWESOME. You get to actually ""live"" as a pilot of an super-advanced Mecha-Botic.. something BADASS robot. But now.. let's move on to the Pros :)Pros :Gameplay - Your choices have a SERIOUS impact on the whole thing , but hey, you can always *cough* scroll up *cough*Ladies - Don't make me write the reasson.. pleaseKAORI - I wish she was real.. ideal gf. Don't wan't to tell you the details tho so you can enjoy getting to know her on your own Storyline - I think the game has an awesome story. (cried twice)Inside jokes - There's a LOT of them comin'Famous things that already has a name almost every 1 knows - OH god the lord of the rings xDDDCons :Your character -  There's 2 complains from my side. You guys can't just let me handle only 200 pounds as the strongest character choice available. You even called that a ""BEAST MODE"" i was sitting here and then bursted out of laughterThat leaves only 1 thing for me to complain about..I DIDN'T GET TO SEE THEM TITIES *curse you devs* (not really, i enjoyed your game too much to actually mean it)Rating : 10-10 RemarkableIn the end, let me just say that i don't want you to end here. You are just amazing guys, keep it up (please)			"

												First, what I love about this game:It doesn't follow typical misogynistic tropes you see in VNs and, where it does, it usually pokes fun at itself (or it pokes fun at farts like me who take such things too seriously).You WILL be laughing throughout the game. The characters are fun and endearing (if a little stereotypical at times). Going Overdrive makes you feel like a BA.So why do I not recommend it? Because the story ends half way through! I don't want to spoil anything (and mentioning anything about the main plot will spoil it), but you're in the middle of trying to solve this mystery, you're in the middle of your school year, in the middle of your budding romance and the game just stops! I was terribly disappointed. Here's the deal, the developers obviously care and I'd hate to cost them sales. But if you need closure or a great story with an even better ending, I'd look elsewhere. Or at least see if they're going to make a sequel. As of now, this is all we got and it really isn't enough. So I don't recommend.			"

												Ace Academy was definetly did well in sticking out among the other, ""usual"" visual novels out there, as it has full english voice acting and overall just feels a little more western inspired then most. I have to admit that the story was really enjoyable, the charcters were entertaining enough, but sometimes came across a little cookie cutter, particularly Kaori and Valerie, oh and Mayu. The rest are passable. Yuuna best girl, yeah I said it, fight me in real life.The voice acting was a big part of the enjoyment for me, it was a welcome new addition, seeing as all the voice acted VN's on steam are spoken in Japanese. No offence to sub watchers, I just prefer dubs. Anyways the overall quality of the VA I felt was kinda low, I know that the people who made this are an indie company and you gotta start somewhere, but there were times when I heard echo, some of the lines could have been delivered a little better, hopfully there next game will be a little more refined in the VA department.Now I want to talk about all the choices and stuff. I was pretty let down by the abrupt ending, it felt like they where way behind and had to just push the game throught. They dident have to tie everything up in a little bow, I just would of liked a little more closure on everything, end the game on a more imperative note. Maybe i'm just salty because I dident ""get"" with any of the girls because I spread my time out with a bunch of different people. The visuals are nice to look at, I don't think as nice as some of the other ones you can play on steam, but still ok for a indie company, I thought that the pictures of the mechs where pretty cool so I will give them props for that. This was clearly a passion project for the individuals involved in making it.Overall, I think you should give this game a shot. It will keep you busy for about 4 hours give or take, depending on how fast you read, and as comes with all the things associated with VN, a nice escape from reality into a world of cute girls and giant mech suits, even though it does have its faults, I gaurentee you will find yourself chucking over some of the jokes and references, and having a fun time finding your waifu.

												All right this is my first review so it may not be that good.I have just finished all of the game (as in 100%) and I must say it was a very well put together game with nice choice, romance options, and decent story. I truly do recomend this game. I bought the game at the full asking price of $20 and I must say it was worth every penny. If you are trying to decide if you want to buy this game or not I strongly recommend you do!			"

												TL:DR. Just gonna list the pros and cons AND MENTION THEIR GAME CRYSTALLINE WHICH IS IN KICKSTARTER. 9/10Pros:1. Great english voice acting.2. Easy rollbacks, no more spamming saves on every important decisions to see the different reactions.3. You can be a complete smarta$$.4. Likable waifus (I had to try them all.)5. So many references, can't hate on that.6. You can learn about visual novels inside a visual novel.Cons:1. Just me but it could be longer. Mainly because I'm needy.2. Somewhat predictable.3. This is towards the creators but they need more games.4. Crystalline's goal in kickstarter not met yet.As someone who used to be really into visual novels and just recently started picking them back up again. ACE Academy was a good way to start again even though I'm not a fan of most of Steam's visual novels. Most visual novels I've been through was voiced in Japanese and I've heard not so good things about any of them being voiced in English but this one was wonderfully voiced in English.Now for the characters. Most of time I'd see a romance option I'd be okay without. I didn't have one in this, I needed to be with them all. I know, I'm a ♥♥♥♥♥. Anyway, the romance options was a difficult phase, I was stuck between the French flirty blonde or the fiery aggresive red head in the end (I chose Kaori. She won my heart with that soft side and let's admit, anime. Girls enjoying anime is an instant 6/10 with only being able to score higher to me.) The story was new to me. I'm not really into Mech or sci fi things, I enjoy the classic magic and steel sort of theme. But this thing got me wanting to play some Mech games, so big big plus. While the story is predictable in some things it doesn't make it any less enjoyable. Who wouldn't want to be in a family of wisecracks? And the numerous references makes the game memorable imo because you'll always remember the references you catch.In the end, I would strongly recommend this game to anyone seeking to look into visual novels. Easily and I mean EASILY one of the best ones Steam has to offer. I apologize for the poor formatting, I don't understand a thing in it and I don't do reviews often.REMEMBER TO SUPPORT THE KICKSTARTER FOR CRYSTALLINE IF YOU DESIRE MORE GAMES FROM THESE FOLKS. Okay, I'm done fanboying over the game.			"

												Really fun visual novel. Only did the Yuuna route so far and it took me about 9 hours. The rest of the routes won't take near as long, but I wouldnt be surpised if I'm well over 15 hours once is all said and done.Story is pretty cliche, but I had fun reading it, and it made me laugh many times. Lots of solid references to anime and American culture/memes. Characters are okay, and the voice acting is pretty hit or miss, but I've heard worse.If you really love visual novels, it's probably worth the 20 bucks, but I rarely buy things full price on Steam. I got it for $5 on sale, but since I enjoyed it so much I decided to back the studios next project on Kickstarter.			"

												I Loved the game! I have but one complaint with the game, and that is honestly probably because I misread something at some point. I initially thought the game has some turn based fighting elements (Like Final Fantasy, or another typical RPG) what with the giant robot matches, I was disappointed to find out that this was not the case, and the game is mostly a dating/interaction simulator. That being said it is an amazing one! This game was able to make my love of giant robots fighting each other the icing on an amazing cake! The game is hilarious at points, and the characters are lovable, generating situations that made me emotional in many different ways! Like *Super duper spoilers I shouldn't put in a review*! The characters are dynamic and interesting, instead of simply single dimensional side characters, and its awesome! I must say I could complain at times that some of the scenes were used in weird ways, and the game could have definitely benefited from more backgrounds and character sprites to help convey emotion, but it is understandable and in my opinion acceptable as is! Also some of the characters audio didn't voice properly at points, though that could have been my computer, not the game itself, so take that with a grain of salt.TLDR: THIS GAME IS AWESOME AND PROBABLY WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR, BUT NOT A TURN BASED RPG			"

												This visual novel is very well done for the budget that it was on. What that means is don't expect a glorious masterpiece on par with Grisaia no Kajitsu or Clannad. :).That being said, I really did enjoy this VN a lot. It's one of the few that I've played that is in English and I actually really enjoyed the voice actors. I thought they all did a splendid job and really cared about their role. Each route is quite simple and unfortunately, they are all pretty much carbon copies of each other, just with a different girl and doing different things every once in a while. Despite this, I still enjoyed each route and thought that they were all really well done in their own way. The music is good, and the art is good as well. I refuse to jump on the Kaori is best girl bandwagon and can honestly say that I liked pretty much all the routes in equal measure.Finally, a word of warning, the ending isn't very conclusive. It's understandable, but still kinda dissapointing.			"

Early Access Review
								NOW THAT THE GAME IS COMPLETE I SHALL EDIT MY ANALISIS:-FirstACE Academy is a visual novel that set our character in a world where human have develop great machine call GEAR, this machine on thebegining where created for war, now they are used for sport and competitions.here is the premise, the game has character creation, in which we can create our Pilot, with, Name, Surname, and Backstory, which are, a cool guy, perfect in sports,a inteligent guy, and a calm and intuitive guy, this will afect the story giving you diferent situations.The story is full of choices, that can change it. and is long, and i mean very long, thats great for the ones that like me enjoy long visual novels, for those who don´t, don´t worry, the story is not heavy to read, with several funny moments, and pop culture references.The characters, love them hate them but all of them are very well made, with a personality that evolves and change, and you will find yourself if this are the same characters that you see at the begining of the game.All characters are voiced.the romance is a very important point in this VN, and when most Visual novels have a main story, and a secondary story, where the romance is develop, ACE Academy have only main story, that changes depending on your romance route.This are my points, ACE Academy is one of the Best VN here in steam, and probably one of the best ever made,iF you like this kind of games buy it, you won´t regret it.

												[should be at least two hours up there.  not sure what's up.]  There's a lot of things I like about this game (every girl is, above everything, clearly intelligent) and a few things I don't (the plot doesn't climax as much as it rolls to a stop), but there's one very notable thing that makes this a top-notch addition to any VN fan's library...This game has the most sprites per character I've ever seen in a visual novel.  Besides the uniform and the costume sprites, every girl has what felt like a half-dozen different casual outfits.  You know, like people ACTUALLY DO.  This is an excellent touch that made me enjoy already a solid visual novel all the more.			"

												I don't generally do the whole review thing unless a game is either really good or really bad. Given that I've put a thumbs up in the top left here it doesn't take a genius to figure which of the two I think this game falls under. I've read a fair number of visual novels such as rewrite, muv-luv and clannad and I feel it certainly holds its own in quality to those three. The novel is quite a bit shorter then most of the novels I've read however, I never really felt there were any points that dragged and it kept me engaged throughout. Like the three novels I listed at the top it has branching paths. Ace Academy does a good job of making the choices feel rewarding and interesting. The visuals are well done, the music is fitting, and the humor is excellent and the game is very self aware of what it is. The female leads are well developed, although they do all fall under the typical tropes you'd expect from this type of game. I didn't feel any were weaker then the others, there's also a decent amount of fanservice for each of them if you're into that sort of thing. The game also does a good job with the protagonist and family, they felt realistic and easy to project onto while still feeling like an actual character. No bland white knight here.All in all I was impressed by the game and would recommend to anyone who has an interest in this genre of game. I look forward to future projects from this company.			"

												Flaws first: the giant robot combat is fairly weak, and could be so much more. And there really doesn't feel like there's an ending. There's buildup to what feels like it could be an ending, but it doesn't actually seem to have anything conclusive happen at the end.As for the rest? Great visual novel. Characters are wonderful, voicing is great, writing is superb. I laughed at this game more then I have at anything else in a long time. Heavily recommended.			"

												Love this VN.  It has good English voice acting which is nice to see on an Indie game.  There's also a good number of routes with each characters story developing regardless if you follow their route or not, which is a very interesting approach to take.I actually managed to snap this up in the sale yesterday. Which means my first play through will be from episode one all the way through to the finale.Another thing that I like about this VN is it has some genuinely funny moments abd it doesn't try too hard.  All around it's a very nice polished game and would recommend to anyone who enjoys visual novels.  The art work is very good, will definitely be keeping an eye out for any future games by these guys.			"

												I absolutely loved this VN.  A lot of people have already mentioned the voice acting, but seriously, it is SO good!  This is very much a feel-good novel.  There are a couple of tragic/dramatic elements, but they comprise less than 10% of the story.  The rest of the time it's all smiles and laughter - a lot of the choices and characters' responses made me laugh out loud.  The VN pokes fun at tropes even while following them, which works out surprisingly well.  It is absolutely worth the asking price.  There's only one downside to this novel - it feels like Chapter One of a much longer story.  I really hope they make a sequel someday, because I'd love to spend more time at ACE Academy!  (Also, Shou is best girl.)			"

												ACE Academy takes place in a hypothetical alternate timeline where the Allies lost World War II, leading to the terrifying future dystopia that Hitler envisioned: Every person on the planet is white and really good at everything.Yes, exceptionalism is the norm in the ACE Academy universe.  Everyone is physically, mentally, and emotionally fit.  Name any hobby or activity, you and all of your friends are good at it.  You might wonder how well this dynamic works when the plot ostensibly revolves around a fighting competition.  Well I'll tell you.  It works by keeping the stakes low and having the characters overcome any minor obstacle that appears in their way within five minutes of its introduction to the plot.""But you can't have EVERYONE be exceptional,"" you may say.  ""Story quality aside, having everyone be 'exceptional' literally defeats the meaning of the word itself.""  Well you see, ACE Academy is the perfect demonstration of why you are wrong.  Even though all the people in this story, including your rivals, are talented and super-cool nice people, you are still the BEST at being talented and super-nice.  But that's the thing.  The winner is YOU.  You are ALWAYS the winner, ""you"" meaning ""every single person who plays this game"".  You are all white guys, and you are all winners.  It works.  The system works.By the way.  I've heard it said that there is a basic premise behind every harem anime, and that is that the harem is always focused on a particular fetish, and all the girls within the harem are just variations of that fetish.  I believe that is at least true for this game, and in this case the central fetish is ""being normal"".  Of course, all the girls are exceptional at everything, but that IS normal in this universe as I already stated.  Their personalities are otherwise consistently plain and reasonable.  And within that central fetish of exceptional normalcy, you have your standard variations:- Shy normal- Loud normal- Sexy normal- Normal normal- Siscon loliconAnyway, I hope this review has helped you determine whether you are a member of the intended demographic for this game.  If you are uncertain, perhaps this will help: Statistically speaking, you probably are.			"

												I absolutely loved this VN.  A lot of people have already mentioned the voice acting, but seriously, it is SO good!  This is very much a feel-good novel.  There are a couple of tragic/dramatic elements, but they comprise less than 10% of the story.  The rest of the time it's all smiles and laughter - a lot of the choices and characters' responses made me laugh out loud.  The VN pokes fun at tropes even while following them, which works out surprisingly well.  It is absolutely worth the asking price.  There's only one downside to this novel - it feels like Chapter One of a much longer story.  I really hope they make a sequel someday, because I'd love to spend more time at ACE Academy!  (Also, Shou is best girl.)			"

												Love this VN.  It has good English voice acting which is nice to see on an Indie game.  There's also a good number of routes with each characters story developing regardless if you follow their route or not, which is a very interesting approach to take.I actually managed to snap this up in the sale yesterday. Which means my first play through will be from episode one all the way through to the finale.Another thing that I like about this VN is it has some genuinely funny moments abd it doesn't try too hard.  All around it's a very nice polished game and would recommend to anyone who enjoys visual novels.  The art work is very good, will definitely be keeping an eye out for any future games by these guys.			"

												Although I wouldn't put this as my favorite visual novel game of all time, it's close. This game is a mix of comedy, romance, and some drama. I'm really happy that this game is full of choices, because most visual novels I play tend to only have a few choices; not even affecting the story.Let me tell you guys something. When I started to play games, I always go for the ones that focus more on the story than the actual gameplay. Because of this, I wanted to look for games that do this. That's when I found out about visual novels. I wanted to look for a decent visual novel: one befitting my satisfaction (No, not that kind of pleasure). I finally stumbled upon some that are okay, good, and amazing. ACE Academy is one of them, and I'm interested in what the developers have in stored for us next time they release a new visual novel.Other than what I stated above, this game has some good music. I also like the quick time choices. The voice cast is awesome, and all the characters aren't bad. Of course there are some flaws in the game, but they aren't major. I wished that some interactions with the characters are a bit longer, and try not to skip the whole thing.Finally, thank you developers for the awesome game. I also woudn't mind if there was a sequel to the game ;)			"

												This Visual Novel is definitely one of the best Indie VNs i have ever played, there has not been an Indie VN that has placed so much effort into a VN before. I cried with the endings and some other scenes. And i say a VN that can bring my emotions out is an amazing VN.The choices available are very well placed. There are so many choices, i could not be happier. I've been trying to found such a game for a long time. It has ticked off nearly everything i wanted. The only thing missing is the Nikki route.There definitely should be a sequel, and i dont say this about many VNs but this is something else.Love the VN! LOVE KAORI!!! KAORI IS WAIFU!!! (for the game of course, Asuna remains to be true WAIFU!!!)			"

												This is the visual novel that I was searching for. The game is not perfect and could use more customization, but it is one the most fun VNs I have ever played. The description is pretty straight forward in the store page. Just a quick summary, it is boy moves to new country, he is the star Mech Pilot at the academy, he mets ""the girl"", he searches for answers about his past, and makes friends in the process.ArtBeatiful and well developed. It was a little more westernized than the usual anime/manga style of VNs I am used to.SoundThe soundtrack was appropriate for every scene and really enhanced the experience. I am a native English speaker and I appreciate the excellent voice acting. This game is in a small market for native English VNs. GameplayIt was originally point & click, reaction time, and ASWD pushing for battles, then they changed it to reaction time and choices. I found it different from the Alpha play-throughs, but it was transitioned gracefully. It also has the tradition choice screens to dictate the next scene or action.StoryThe story doesn't break any grounds on originality. Although, the story flowed well. I just finished the final release a few days ago and I'm hungry for more content. It is a typical VN story, sprinkled with the typical tropes. I find that it was well put together and not boring. The story was simple and easy to follow. I have played the Sunrider series to put into contrast. That was a good game too, but it often felt a bit too grindy between choices. Just put the girl you want in your choice and whammy you get the girl. I had suggestions for trolling and picking the inappropriate lines. Maybe I will next play-through.If you are on the fence about this game and you are looking for a quality VN, then this is your game. I am looking forward to their next project Crystalline to add to my collection. Happy Gaming and Cheers!SpoilerThe end was abrupt and left me wanting more story. I guess it sets up for a sequel. I wish there was a way to at least bring some closure to the story line, instead of leaving you hanging "

												I have played a few VNs but this by far is one of my favorites. I am all about choices and consequences, backstory and the like. This VN has a lot of humor in it. At first I didn't want to do an early access for a game because I wanted a product first. But I was hungry for a new and hopefully better VN then the ones that I have played. I loved how they put my favorite actor in the story and put his first ever award in there! Just awesome! Which now I do not regret...well maybe the ending...When got in for the Early Access for this game and there was a lot of clamour for having the Nikki as a romance option. I loved how the devs trolled on that and said it was strictly a big bro proctecting his little sister. Then they put a teaser of the main character with her in certain outfit in story and then proceeded to squash all the critics. But to me it just felt like they could have added more to it; just seemed like a very minor side-story.This VN had very good humor in it. At times I felt sorry for Nikki and Kaori. But they are some issues that needs to be addressed. There were some unvoiced dialog or the dialog was read differently or backwards (The last two sentences were spoken then the first two senctences were spoken, which made it very confusing). Also for the choices on who to spend time with, there should be more instead of two or three everytime (should be all options).Minor characters were represented by silhouettes. Minor grammatical errors. When it states the chacater(s) are roaring with laughter I expect that sometimes the voice overs were melodramatic when it came to those lines. The Black Screens....really? Oh and using the same artwork for different locations such as the Cafe and Bookstore (how are they the same?). And there's the lackluster ending...I was hoping for more.I have read many reveiws here and im glad they are pointing out the same issues that I have seen. And now I want the second ACE Academy to come out! Praying it will be as good if not better and looking forward to more from PixelFade Studios!			"

												ACE Academy takes place in a hypothetical alternate timeline where the Allies lost World War II, leading to the terrifying future dystopia that Hitler envisioned: Every person on the planet is white and really good at everything.Yes, exceptionalism is the norm in the ACE Academy universe.  Everyone is physically, mentally, and emotionally fit.  Name any hobby or activity, you and all of your friends are good at it.  You might wonder how well this dynamic works when the plot ostensibly revolves around a fighting competition.  Well I'll tell you.  It works by keeping the stakes low and having the characters overcome any minor obstacle that appears in their way within five minutes of its introduction to the plot.""But you can't have EVERYONE be exceptional,"" you may say.  ""Story quality aside, having everyone be 'exceptional' literally defeats the meaning of the word itself.""  Well you see, ACE Academy is the perfect demonstration of why you are wrong.  Even though all the people in this story, including your rivals, are talented and super-cool nice people, you are still the BEST at being talented and super-nice.  But that's the thing.  The winner is YOU.  You are ALWAYS the winner, ""you"" meaning ""every single person who plays this game"".  You are all white guys, and you are all winners.  It works.  The system works.By the way.

												Amazing game, binged played this from the moment I started it. The game sadly larks a long story line only about 6 hours if you play it constantly. For most players that will be about 11 hours. So maybe the game is too over pricy for most people at £19.00. But for anime fans and visual novals fans. Who like visual novels with full and enteraining dialoge and dubbed english voice acters. Then it's a must buy if you fit any of that catagory. Sadly I would wait until this game goes down in price. As £19.00 is a bit to much for a game that doesn't give you the hours to match it. But overall it's a very entertaining play and a must have for anime or visual noval fans! 10/10 Must play Ace Academy Again!			"

Early Access Review
								NOW THAT THE GAME IS COMPLETE I SHALL EDIT MY ANALISIS:-FirstACE Academy is a visual novel that set our character in a world where human have develop great machine call GEAR, this machine on thebegining where created for war, now they are used for sport and competitions.here is the premise, the game has character creation, in which we can create our Pilot, with, Name, Surname, and Backstory, which are, a cool guy, perfect in sports,a inteligent guy, and a calm and intuitive guy, this will afect the story giving you diferent situations.The story is full of choices, that can change it. and is long, and i mean very long, thats great for the ones that like me enjoy long visual novels, for those who don´t, don´t worry, the story is not heavy to read, with several funny moments, and pop culture references.The characters, love them hate them but all of them are very well made, with a personality that evolves and change, and you will find yourself if this are the same characters that you see at the begining of the game.All characters are voiced.the romance is a very important point in this VN, and when most Visual novels have a main story, and a secondary story, where the romance is develop, ACE Academy have only main story, that changes depending on your romance route.This are my points, ACE Academy is one of the Best VN here in steam, and probably one of the best ever made,iF you like this kind of games buy it, you won´t regret it.

												A really, really well written, well (voice) acted, well drawn visual novel. Broseph goes to Japan to attend Mecha school, spoil his younger sister and date his team mates.If this all sounds a little familiar, it's because it is. This VN is like comfort food, every event and every character is something you've seen before, if you have the least bit of interest in the genre. I'd say it's at once the greatest strength and the greatest weakness of the game.What saves the story is how professionally done everything is. If the overall quality hadn't been so good, the sheer familiarity would become overwhelmingly boring, but because it's so well made, it manages to become engaging in spite of its self imposed limitations. In particular, it's very rare to find a western VN with such quality voice acting, and that alone elevates it to a very special place.However, it's also a VN that doesn't take any chances whatsoever. It all falls into tropes and scenes that read like someone was following a check list. I would love to see another VN from this team with original characters and a story that doesn't stick so closely to the universal comfort zone.A great visual novel, but also a very, very safe one.

												Exactly what it says on the tin: a reasonable slice of life visual novel with robots.Pros:Tons of meme culture- good humor I haven't seen captured in VNs beforeDecent musicDecent artwork""Quick time events"" were interestingCons:My major cripe with this VN is its shallowness. The characters develop only minimally from typical trope-ish issues. The choices only effect which character you end up with, and you can't lose your matches (making the above quick time events a moot point). The plot doesn't go anywhere, and the achievements the main character makes don't have the impact I like from these types of games. Minorly, it's somewhat short (4 hours for me for first entire run through), and due to the above issue, not a ton of replayability.If you're looking for a light-hearted, makes-you-smile with lots of meme references, you'll like ACE Academy (although only pick it up on sale for the short game time). This game would make a great introduction to visual novels. If you're looking for something serious or makes you think, pass.Rating: 6/10			"

												I've beaten the kaori path and i can say this visual novel is good, the beggining is very interesting but it lost quality on the second half. The battles were interesting in the beggining but as soon as you get to the third battle it starts to get boring, what keeps the game good are the characters. For an indie visual novel its great, the game could be a masterpiece if they implemented a simple turn based rpg fighting system and the writing kept the same great quality.Still i totally recommend buying this and i will watch for their next projects.

												I like VN but I love combat. If you want combat with a lot of depth this is not for you. If you want a VN with combat here and there then this is a good option. I bought the game because it's on sale and I was curious to how little combat this has. And the combat is basically Quick Time Events where you choose the right choice in the standard middle of the screen dialouge options with a timer on the side. To be honest, it works really well to simulate fast paced combat. The only down side is that you can't customize Eagle, your mech. But I guess it would be a lot of work to implement an actual combat system with stats and inventory. If ACE Academy have that I would give it 5 stars.However since it is a VN you can't just review it based on a side activity. The meat of the game is the VN elements and that I would give it 5 stars for. The voice acting is excellent, although 2 characters sound a bit similar. The character CGI is beutiful, the writing is great, and the extra emotion bubble to highlight what the character is feeling is a nice addition. The writing though is what sets it apart from other VN games I haave tried. The game doesn't take itself too seriously, so you have jokes and memes aplenty which not many VNs implement which is a shame. Here are a few memes, various alternate movies and tv shows, a certain ultimate from an edgelord from a very popular game, and globally famous meme from Dragon Ball. You can also name your own special move and I legit named mine Falcon Punch :DSo this is a solid VN game with QTE combat which is great, but with a customizable mech, it could have been perfect. 9/10 or 4.5/5 "

												An amazing game i just couldnt get enough of it! This was my first ""Visual Novel"" and it truly blew me away. The artwork was also amazing! as well as the storyline! A few issues though, most of the scenes were reused alot affecting the games storyline and feel in general. In not complaining but it does feel a bit rushed and there are some scenes where there could of been some artwork.Well enough of the downsides i would highly recommend this game due to the amount of effort thats gone into this game and how well the characters were developed (My fav was Kaori BTW!!)Just a quick note i do understand that pixelFade runs off crowd funding that i find amazing and i cant wait for there next next game (Ive also played the demo of there newest project its AMAZING!!!)    Thanks for reading my review!  Keep up the great work PixelFade Studio's   :)			"

Just a fair warning, the review ahead contains some minor spoilers!And finally done! That took me quite a while though. Bought this game around November 2015 and after a whole year, I finally got to sit down and play it on December 2016. After finally finished all the four routes, here's my thought about the game. It's great, it's charming, it's witty and the humor is great too, one that you may not find on the Japanese counterpart. Overall I'm really satisfied reading it. With that said, here's some quick pro and cons:Pros:ValerieGreat humor, the developer knew what they're doing with it, and you certainly won't be disappointedA lot of references to some popular games and pop culture, I actually loved this part the mostValerie best girlGreat soundtrackSome amazing voice acting. I can't mention this enough, the voice acting on this game are definitely top notch, especially for Nikki and ValerieOh did I mention that Valerie is the best girl? I did? Good.Cons:Kaori. Her route feels somewhat...underwhelmed. I think it's because she got overshadowed by the main story and there's not that many room for her development. The only route that I can honestly say I didn't enjoyThe ending kinda ends abruptly, but it's understandable because they can only do with the budget they had and I heard the game is already twice as long than the one they initially planned forThe study part on the class serves almost no purpose, there's no pop quiz nor exam, save for that one part at the beginningSome CGs are being overused a bit much, but this won't hinder you from enjoying the story.I think it's great what they've done and there's definitely a room for a sequel (when are you gonna release Ace Academy: Supernova, PixelFade?), so for now I'll just keep my finger crossed while waiting for their next work.

It's Possible?! I'm truly amazed as after my previous experience with western romance VN developers always resulted with either being mediocre or just plain bad from awful story writing to hilariously bad artwork. Yet here I find a hidden gem among them called: ACE Academy.When playing the game and being blown away expecting nothing more than mediocrity (I read others reviews and suffer) and instead getting all the things necessary for romance genre with one extra nice touch and that's english voice acting.Of course it does have its weak points and I'll cover them first.The Weak:Has a fair amount of linear points that won't chage the plot dialogue despite what you say.A nitpick but still I'll say it anyway silhouette characters are used a lot however I can easily forgive this since even big companies like Compile Heart do this in their gamesEvery ending seemed more like a cliffhanger despite the fact that there isn't going to be a sequel.The Strong:Excellent story writing that's quite gripping.It covers some of the typical stereotypes for romance VNs yet actually gives a realistic personality and individual story for  of them to mix with the main plot.The voice acting. Silhouette characters aside the voice acting is great and doesn't sound like its jut read from a script especially considering two fine details 1. It's English and 2. This is on indie budget. A certain someone has covered the importance of voice actors before on their show and this is a game where it truly shines.Choosing your characters personality type actually affects certain game dialogue to a fair amount helping counter-act those linear moments at times throughout the game a bit after playing through a second time or more.My Rating: 8/10 PixelFade Well done on your 1st game.

												If you think you know how good dating sim VN looks, you are wrong. This one is what a good romance VN now is. The quality of depicted relations is unsurpassable for absolute lot of VNs.You have:- team- maintaining relations in a team- did I say teamwork?- excellent cast of girls- excellent sidekick characters- excellent protagonist.You have options to build your character. Many choices may be cosmetic, but you'd better think what YOUR character says.Dialogues are smart and tense, That's why you should think about responce.Romances are very believable. That's how relations work IRL. Their scriptwriter must be very talented (and experienced, if you know what I mean ^_^) to catch it so.Downsides:- poor voice acting (I turned it off)- battles could be more developed- only half of plotline needed to be an AAA novel. I mean, main plot stops in the middle. No cliffhanger, it ends OK, just it should have been more.			"

												The closest to a Visual Novel I've ever come to is perhaps Ace Attorney, but this VN is a very well rounded story at a $10 price point.The Good:- DEAD BLOSSOM IS READY- Prevalant and nuanced voice acting- Some interesting deviations in conversations- Multi-faceted characters- Appropriate and decent soundtrack- A good mix of awesome, cheesy and heavy feels- Great self aware references and comedy- OTP Kaori- Strawberry Dreams. Make it happen someone.The Bad:- Feels disjointed or unresolved at times- Voice acting is overeactionary or stale at times- Some choices are suboptimal, indifferent, aren't included where you wanted or don't include what you intended.- Using the mousewheel to revert slides somewhat removes action permanancy- Kaori's arc outshines the others- Beginning personality is only modestly used, with Athletic being mostly superiorAll that said, I still highly recommend this, though it will spoil your expectations any other character interactions in the future. 9/10, until I find a better VN or a sequel/expansion surfaces.

												""I spend the rest of my evening browsing online for cat videos until it's time for bed.""Would spend more evenings with cat videos. Recommended!~ Edit 1 ~ It's my first review, so... don't scold me too much xDTrue Review:I feel like i need to share my true feelings now that i finished my first playthrough(blind).First things first, i'll say, this is one of the bests VN on Steam that i played so far and in the end of the story i felt like i need more.I wanted to know what happens next so much that before go to sleep i keep imagining the rest of the story for like 2 hours before i felt exhausted and slept as a result.History 5/5The history keeps your attention and it's hard to lose focus out of the screen; it have the right amount of interactions(choices), not so much and not too little, some with timers(just like QTE's from action games).Soundtrack 5/5You can feel the music that gives shivers on the spine when going through the scenes sometimes.Art 4/5I think it happened one or two times, the character did not express the right emotion that was said on the text, but this is so small that the players normally do not see if not pay much attention.Overall 9/10I'll not give 10 'cuz i've got friendzoned in my first playthrough xD.Now i think i'll play another round focusing more on one of the heroines.Devs please do more episodes as updates or as DLC that i'll certainly buy if it comes.

Few stories have ever resonated with me as well as this one did. Not only do the characters' personalities seem genuine, the chemistry between them all feels real. While I have only played through once so far  (just finished the credits to said run, in fact), and never have I been more excited to jump right back into a game! 10/10 am playing again!			"

												This is an amazing game! With a wide variety of options,and a bunch of characters,the possibilites are endless! Also, if you think you finished since you reached the ending, guess what, you didn't! There is actually a gallery and once you check it out,you notice how many parts and scenes you missed out on. I highly recommend this game to everyone debating to buy this or not. It's a game where you have a exciting adventure on campus as a transfer! This also includes action fights which you actually choose what you will do. I'd rate this 10/10. I hope you buy this!			"

												I finished my frist ""playthrough"" at the 9 hour mark.  And I was not disappoint!  I absolutely love the amount of choice this VN gives you.  You get to choose who to hang out with, you get to choose how to respond, and you sometimes get time-limited action prompts to make the mech battle matches feel a bit more interactive.  The story is nothing new- you're a prodigy mech pilot sent to a university in Japan and get to enjoy spending time with your uncle and sister and your new mech battle team including a best bro and two other female pilots, a manager, and an engineer.  You can go for a romance if you want, but it's not required.  There are a couple of VN troopes included (the bikini scene with everyone commenting on each others' boob sizes), but the devs make a note of self-awareness with these scenes.  The game has a happy and fun tone, and I genuinely enjoyed the interactions.  The plot is moved forward by your growing competition to get a sponsor and become the top ranked mech team, your growing relationships with the main characters, and an emerging mystery about the secrets installed in the mech that your father finished before he died.  The backgrounds and character models are rather limited, but the developers did the best with the limited resources they had.  At the full $20, it's still not a bad deal, but I highly recommend picking it up if it's on sale and you're a fan of these types of games.			"

												This game is pretty good for a indie game i must say, for a small dev team i was suprised by the amount of choices i was given, thought most of them were hang out with your girl of choice or your friend :/. If your a fan of VNs i would say this games good and im watching the next game the devs are making tho i will be waiting for its full release rather then following it ep by ep and i do need to say this the ending FELT like an anime ending. We all know that ending where it ends on an arc but is clearly setting up the next one but the show ends and youd need to read the books or manga to get the real ending, However here you cant go to the source because this is it. The ending may be paramount but this game is still fun and i do feel i should support the team who made it as i have high hopes for them. Quick breakdownStory: Solid 8/10This game has 4 main routes and friendship route if your too slow to get on any of the girls routes but their well paced enough to feel organic. One of the problems with this game is since you name your charecter none of the other charecters EVER call you by your name just nicknames.this threw me off at first but i got used to it after about an hour.Also quick sidenote the fact your sister is named nikki Was funny as hell to me since my REAL sisters name is nikki just a fun little note. I must say some of the side storys were ignored such as Strike X a team brought up a few times by 2 of your teammates and who was built up as a clear antagonist but is just ignored. their story and how it relates to your teammates isnt told, their written out by the writers as your preparing to fight them. This game lacks an antagonist as far as i can tell which was strange. No evil corperation or evil classmate to fight its just normal life excusing a single plot point brought up very early on and expanded slowly. Overall this game has a solid story and i hope the devs come back to this game and give it a real ending i do know their moving onto a new game for now and intend to check it out, however if this lack of ending becomes a norm for them i will update this reviewGameplay: 7/10its a visual novel with some QTE like events during the mech battles and while it was kind of cool i wish more of the battles were like the first one with mashing D to charge up and using a finisher move of your own name with a stupid catchphrase(WAY TO MUCH FUN DICKING WITH THIS XD). it was so cheesy but in a good way and i know if they put it in every fight it would have annoyed me but seeing it more would have been nice. Writing: 9/10THIS STORY WILL MAKE YOUR LAUGH YOUR♥♥♥♥♥OFF. its full of so many memes refrences to anime,other VNs, and japanese culture though the devs are american so remember they dont have a full grasp of japan which means their wrong on a few things but i only noticed when i went and looked it up. The options range from straight guy to clueless to flirty with every girl and i loved it all the way and the ""choice"" when your little sister begs your for something made me cry it was so true! If your an older brother youll get it i promise.Romance: 9/10all the girls feel somewhat alive, their tropes yes but they didnt feel stale each one has a few twists and diffrences that make them charecters not tropes. The routes feel natural its not Get girl to like you and sleep with her. you need to earn it and even at the end with certain girls they wont go all the way with you which makes sense since your dating for a max of a few months girls dont spread their legs at the drop of a hat gentalmen and i prefered it that way. However their are so very flirty and very implied lines of dialoge esspecially with val she wants it badly!Do i think you should buy this game? Yes i do i feel the devs deserve our support and with some more money can make something to blow us away theirs plenty of replay value with all the routes with each taking about 12 hours totaling 60 hours of gameplay, now i got this game on a steamsale for half price. If you can afford it buy it at full price i do feel its worth it but if your like me and short of cash wait for a sale then pick it up			"

												Before this game, I had never played a Visual novel, hadn't even considered it.  The closest I was to one was watching Chilled Chaos play Katawa Shoujo on youtube.  Man I do not regret buying this game one bit.  The writing is fantastic, the art and CGs are amazing, and best of all, it's Voice acted in ENGLISH.  That's not something you see often in VNs.  I enjoyed the premise, and it flowed perfectly.  (if you're here because Amalee got you interested, you aren't alone, she VAs 2 parts, and it's fantastic)  I'm a huge fan of Pixelfade now, only a month after my purchase, and I'm actively following their next project, which will be just as awesome10/10 most fun I've had in a while, and most emotional I've gotten from a game since Cortana died in Halo 4			"

Although the ending was abrupt, it was actually finished, yet of course they could make it longer if they had sufficient financing. It felt like I was just about to unravel something, to change something, buuuut it ended. Just make sure to NOT press ""Goodbye"" after credits to get that final treat to make ending of the novel a tiny bit less painful! Not because it was bad, but because it sucked that it ended!Spent aprox 14 hours on story, 100% will be replayed, as soon as I get emotionally detached from it first:DWorth at full price, final mark affected by the ending, though I understand why it was how it was.WARNING: Possible cry material			"

												Ace Academy was definetly did well in sticking out among the other, ""usual"" visual novels out there, as it has full english voice acting and overall just feels a little more western inspired then most. I have to admit that the story was really enjoyable, the charcters were entertaining enough, but sometimes came across a little cookie cutter, particularly Kaori and Valerie, oh and Mayu. The rest are passable. Yuuna best girl, yeah I said it, fight me in real life.The voice acting was a big part of the enjoyment for me, it was a welcome new addition, seeing as all the voice acted VN's on steam are spoken in Japanese. No offence to sub watchers, I just prefer dubs. Anyways the overall quality of the VA I felt was kinda low, I know that the people who made this are an indie company and you gotta start somewhere, but there were times when I heard echo, some of the lines could have been delivered a little better, hopfully there next game will be a little more refined in the VA department.Now I want to talk about all the choices and stuff. I was pretty let down by the abrupt ending, it felt like they where way behind and had to just push the game throught. They dident have to tie everything up in a little bow, I just would of liked a little more closure on everything, end the game on a more imperative note. Maybe i'm just salty because I dident ""get"" with any of the girls because I spread my time out with a bunch of different people. The visuals are nice to look at, I don't think as nice as some of the other ones you can play on steam, but still ok for a indie company, I thought that the pictures of the mechs where pretty cool so I will give them props for that. This was clearly a passion project for the individuals involved in making it.Overall, I think you should give this game a shot. It will keep you busy for about 4 hours give or take, depending on how fast you read, and as comes with all the things associated with VN, a nice escape from reality into a world of cute girls and giant mech suits, even though it does have its faults, I gaurentee you will find yourself chucking over some of the jokes and references, and having a fun time finding your waifu.

Just a fair warning, the review ahead contains some minor spoilers!And finally done! That took me quite a while though. Bought this game around November 2015 and after a whole year, I finally got to sit down and play it on December 2016. After finally finished all the four routes, here's my thought about the game. It's great, it's charming, it's witty and the humor is great too, one that you may not find on the Japanese counterpart. Overall I'm really satisfied reading it. With that said, here's some quick pro and cons:Pros:ValerieGreat humor, the developer knew what they're doing with it, and you certainly won't be disappointedA lot of references to some popular games and pop culture, I actually loved this part the mostValerie best girlGreat soundtrackSome amazing voice acting. I can't mention this enough, the voice acting on this game are definitely top notch, especially for Nikki and ValerieOh did I mention that Valerie is the best girl? I did? Good.Cons:Kaori. Her route feels somewhat...underwhelmed. I think it's because she got overshadowed by the main story and there's not that many room for her development. The only route that I can honestly say I didn't enjoyThe ending kinda ends abruptly, but it's understandable because they can only do with the budget they had and I heard the game is already twice as long than the one they initially planned forThe study part on the class serves almost no purpose, there's no pop quiz nor exam, save for that one part at the beginningSome CGs are being overused a bit much, but this won't hinder you from enjoying the story.I think it's great what they've done and there's definitely a room for a sequel (when are you gonna release Ace Academy: Supernova, PixelFade?), so for now I'll just keep my finger crossed while waiting for their next work.

												This is not a perfect game. It is however an enjoyable one.The devs clearly put a lot of love and creativity into it. The art is fantastic, the music is solid, and the girls are most certainly cute.The main storyline has a weak ending, but the game instead focuses on the relationships. I think this was the right call. I enjoyed interacting with the various characters, whether they were romantic interests, friends, or faceless silhouettes. Every time I reached the end, I got a bit wistful. I wanted to spend more time with these characters, but the time I spent was good. This game is brimming with personality. You done good, Pixelfade. I'm glad I backed you on Kickstarter, way back when this was a game about a kendo club. Can't wait to see what you come out with next.FINAL RATING: Ultra-realistic stomach grumbling sound effects/10			"

												Before this game, I had never played a Visual novel, hadn't even considered it.  The closest I was to one was watching Chilled Chaos play Katawa Shoujo on youtube.  Man I do not regret buying this game one bit.  The writing is fantastic, the art and CGs are amazing, and best of all, it's Voice acted in ENGLISH.  That's not something you see often in VNs.  I enjoyed the premise, and it flowed perfectly.  (if you're here because Amalee got you interested, you aren't alone, she VAs 2 parts, and it's fantastic)  I'm a huge fan of Pixelfade now, only a month after my purchase, and I'm actively following their next project, which will be just as awesome10/10 most fun I've had in a while, and most emotional I've gotten from a game since Cortana died in Halo 4			"

												Very good, but short and expensive. I don't care that you did a 'crowdfunding', when you charge full price for a half finished game AFTER you've made it episodic already, that's just a wonky excuse. I don't buy half-finished books/movies with a disclaimer at the end that some very naive people didn't pay ALL of your costs up front.			"

												This game is quite impressive. It's got an interesting set up, memorable characters and a good blend of comedy, romance and family in this Slice-of-Life visual novel.I especially like the relationship MC has with his sister and Uncle, and the backstory behind their family is pretty interesting too.The classmates are some of the best, though.Shou, the goofy, perverted best friend who's basically Yosuke from Persona 4Kaori, the easily embarrassed TsundereYuuna, the kind-hearted schoolgirlMayu, the meek and shy girland Valerie, the flirtatious and confident transfer student			"

But.... I admit PixelFade could have rounded out the ending.... unless... there's a hidden sequel upcoming... ;p			"

												I normally dont play games like this(at least not anime themed ones),but ACE academy managed to get me into this now.The game is very funny,but it also has serious moments sometimes.The characters actions are understandable and dont feel too unrealistic or forced.Now,since there was also fighting involved:I think that it suits the game very well,since you fight by reading,and making your choice fast(you only got a few seconds).The only problem i have with the game......is the ending.I dont want to spoiler it,but it wasnt really satisfying for me.The game ends out of the blue,and many things are beeing left in the dark,and you dont get to see what will happens later.I thought that i would have much more time to work on the main characters relationship,s aswell,but then the game ended and the MC stayed single.Also,the ending wasnt doing the game any justice,because the game was really EPIC......But then....you get THIS ending.Though,i can understand that they didnt have the ressources for a better ending.The game was amazing,even with a ending like that,totally loved the humour and i will be keeping a eye on pixel fade from now one,and definatly play their next game!PS:Would like to see a ACE academy 2 in the future ;)			"

												I really enjoyed this game, but I honestly felt that the ending was way too rushed. I understand that the dev team couldn't logistically finish the game due to lack of money, but they should have planned around that. The romance and friendship plots with the main cast is done quite well, and the worldbuilding and the character's relationship to said world is also very good. But without spoiling anything, a huge plot thread is gone unanswered. I don't know if the devs have a sequel planned, but in my opinion if they didn't have the time to flesh out the lore behind the protagonist's Core, they should have made less intrigue around it. Instead of a thrilling conclusion, fans are left wondering just what the dev team had planned before the budget cut it short.Either way, this game was a good read for me. I thoroughly enjoyed it up until the ending, so I can't thumb it down. Just bear in mind what I've said.			"

												First of all, let me get this out of the way: I have never been much into Visual Novels. I've played Nekopara, which I enjoyed, but aside from that, I've never liked them. But ACE Academy is different. Much, much different. You see, I don't think any game could pull off the VN formula as well as ACE did, at least not for me. The story is emotional, beautiful, and brilliant, with lots of pop culture refs. Plus (and this is very important for me), the game wraps you up in the characters-- their flaws, their charms, their problems, the way they interact with the main character-- and then it's over, just as quickly as it started. Believe it or not, this is actually a key strength. People don't realize a lot of the time, but when a game is short and sweet, not only can it be better than a huge game, it is also much more RECOMMENDABLE, because it's something that someone can feasibly finish all the way through and still enjoy every part of it. I could go on about how it encourages you to save and take risks, and how each character deviates strongly from stereotypes, but I won't. ACE Academy gets my full recommendation. Go play it. And thank you so much, PixelFade.			"

												Post completion edit: The ending was very heartfelt and nice. Felt like a true culimation of all the good points I have collected but I was surprised at the length, while extremely good it really dragged. The writing was stellar and all characters felt like they got their happy ending even Koari the Tsundere and ""Senpai McButtsniffer"" had a role in it.I went for Yuuna. She is best girl. I'll definitely replay for a Valerie ending though at some point.PS: The voice acting was very well done. I'd guess this was a Triple A title by the voice work... so kudos to them...PPS: Showing people an example of what the controls are would be nice... biggest flaw, but its a visual novel. (You can go back via scrolling the mouse wheel and hard save with a right click)-------------------One unique VN. Unlike most because it's actually hilarious, has GREAT references, does a superb job of making you feel like a Gundam... I mean ""GEAR"" pilot... and is well done. Not just for cheap pervy kicks, but an actual story with very likable characters and a rare sibling that's interactive and fun.Is it 20 bucks worth? Only if you like VNs and anime. If you do, maybe you might find it worth the price but on a sale... VERY worth it. (Edit: Over 10 hours in one playthrough, tons of laughs. Cant see why not??)I know after this, I'll be following the dev's work to see what other fun ideas they might have...			"

												[Summary]:After finishing my first arc in Ace Academy I think a more appropriate title should be ""Pop Culture Reference: A Visual Novel""!But seriously, this is a great VN. It has it's flaws, and I'll get to that, but for the most part this is VN has been a blast to play. I'm not going to go into detail summing up what Ace Academy is about, if anything you've already read the synopsis, and now what you really want to know is whether it’s worth your time, and more importantly, worth your money. I can safely say that the answer to both those questions are: Yes! and Yes! I got this for $10 on a Steam sale, and I would have easily spent the full asking price of $20 for this awesome experience, and the creator's deserve your support.Ace Academy is funny, exciting, and even gives you some feels here and there. The art, while not amazing, is decent, and the CG’s in particular are pretty good. The characters, if somewhat archetypical, are all endearing and decently voice acted (for the most part). Especially considering the cast is made up of mostly amateur, to semi-professional voice actors. To top it all off, Ace Academy fulfilled my childhood dream of shouting “SHINING FINGER!!!!!” right before my transformed mech tore apart my opponent. That experience alone was worth the price of admission! Overall 7/10[Long Version]Ace Academy is a rarity, in that it is one of the few visual novels that is fully voiced IN ENGLISH, and this is the first fully voiced English VN I’ve played. I’ve played a decent amount of visual novels, but all of them were voiced in Japanese, and at least one of them SHOULD have been voiced in English (for more on that check out my review of No One But You). The characters and cast of this VN are, for the most part, very well done, and one of the stand out characters is actually YOU! Because you get to be the protagonist. When talking about the player character, one of the things that Ace Academy did well is the shear amount of choices you can make. This is a very interactive VN. Unlike some other VNs, where you’re given maybe a couple choices that pretty much amount to: “Which character route do you want to play?” Ace Academy has close to a hundred different choices that you can make at different instances throughout the story, and a lot of the options are pretty hilarious. For the most part, these just simply add to the story, giving you several options of how to react to events going on in the story, while a dozen or so directly affect the progression of the plot. You can also imagine my surprise when I was given a choice in a high intensity situation, and suddenly noticed a countdown timer on the screen. So, this VN will even make sure that you’re paying attention at times when your character needs to make split second decisions. This, combined with how the player character was written, led to an experience that I feel can be very personalized for every play through. The player character has enough depth that he doesn’t seem too generic and boring, while also not being so intricate that he becomes unrelatable to the point where you can't see yourself as him. Since most of the aspects of his character are left for you to decide.In regards to the other cast of characters, as this is a VN/Dating Sim, there are four heroines whose character arcs you can explore. I’ll be honest, these four heroines are pretty archetypical, you’ve got Kaori, the tsundere, Mayu, the shy girl, Valerie, the mischievous flirt, and Yuuna, the sweet girl next door. However, despite being archetypical, they do manage to have enough character depth and development where I can excuse their initial lack of originality. In addition, there are several supporting characters including the plucky “best friend” character Shou, your Imouto, (your little sister, for all you uncultured plebs) and your uncle that you live with, that stand out, and that I really enjoyed.Having just finished Mayu’s arc, I will say that there are some aspects of her story that I wish had been handled differently. The whole progression of your relationship with her was somewhat anticlimactic in my opinion. I’m a big fan of dramatic confessions, and passionate kisses, and I sadly didn’t get that. There was also this whole aspect of her relationship with her father that was repeatedly mentioned in the story, but never fully explored. However, as a whole I enjoyed her arc. Now, as I get to some of my main gripes with Ace Academy, let me start by talking about the voice acting. For the most part, the voice acting in Ace Academy is fine. There are some moments, and one character in particular, that were a bit grating, but nothing that seriously grinded on my nerves. If I had to list the strongest performances they would probably lead as follows: Shou, Nikki, Valerie, and then everyone else did fine, but had a couple lines here and there that seemed to fall little short, and could have been delivered better...and then there’s Kaori.I’ll be honest, I don’t like tsunderes to begin with, but Kaori’s character was probably my least favorite from this story, and sadly I believe this is due in large part to how her character was voiced. I don’t know where the blame here lies, whether it’s with the director, or with Kaori’s VA, but her performance was pretty grating at times. There simply wasn’t a lot of range with Kaori’s emotions. She simply sounded♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off all the time, and delivered her lines basically with the same tone and rhythm every time she spoke. It was as if she was given the whole script and just told, “Okay, read every line like you’re♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at someone,” and she read the whole script like that, without actually reading the other character’s lines for context. That’s probably not what happened, but that’s what it felt like. The only other thing I would mention on the voice acting, was that there were certain lines that were just completely dropped, sometimes mid conversation. This didn’t happen till more than half way through, but they did, and again I can understand that mistakes were made here and there, and they didn’t happen frequently enough for me to become too upset. In regards to the story, I really liked Ace Academy, I simply wish there was more, and to an extent I feel the people a PixelFade feel the same way, and they were simply trying to do the best with the resources available to them, and at the end of the day I’m impressed with what we got. I really believe that the selling point of this VN is it’s comedy. Like I said earlier, this VN has A TON of pop culture references in it. With Gladiator being one of my all time favorite movies, I appreciated the many Gladiator references. However, I will say that there are times when I felt that Ace Academy was a little too dependent on it’s otaku and pop culture references for it’s comedy. I personally love that kind of comedy, but I can understand if someone playing Ace Academy got tired of it after awhile.You might feel after reading all of my gripes Ace Academy, that I’ve been pretty harsh, but what I say, I say out of love, and I can tell that this was a labor of love for PixelFade. I really did enjoy Ace Academy at the end of the day, and I will definitely go back and play the rest of the story routes...even Kaori’s. I am simply offering constructive criticism. I know it probably won't happen, but if there ever was a sequel, or remake of Ace Academy, I would love to see these aspects improved upon, and knowing that PixelFade is making more games, I hope they learn from both their achievements, as well as their mistakes moving forward, and make even better games. If you at PixelFade are reading this, keep up the good work! I’ve decided I’m going to support you on Patreon, because I really want to see more of what you can do!			"
