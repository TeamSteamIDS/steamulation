												Heres my original review for RRDDD:""Disco Dodgeball is a game that grabs you by surprise. You first try it out and don't expect to like it all that much but then you look and it's been nearly 30 minutes of you throwing glowing balls at robots with moustaches. Seriously addicting and I cannot wait to see this game come out of early access.""~Version 1.0 Review.~Holy hell the game has changed a lot.RRDDD is still the same game at the core, you're a robot playing dodgeball. Except now there are many many different game modes that change the way the game plays and is so refreshing. One of my favorites being the Arcade mode which is a single player mode where you face bots and you try to rack up cash by killing them in unique ways (dunk, duck hunt, helicopter, etc.) The cash you earn from killing the bots allow you to purchase different upgrades. There is more customization now allowing for your robot to be unique. There is now a feature to customise your Robot's face and have it show up on the end game leaderboards. If I could recommend Disco Dodgeball before, I can recommend it infinitely more today because the price to content ratio in the game is absolutely insane.			"

Early Access Review
								I've been following this game since it's beta, long before it got greenlit.RRDDD (or just Disco Dodgeball) is an easy to learn, hard to master multiplayer game (or singleplayer, against bots) that I loved since the first time I've played it. The game basically consist of silly robots playing deadly dodgeball in several arenas. Different game modes add a lot of variety. For instance: classic deathmatch, FFA modes, hoops (think dodgeball mixed with basketball), elimination, and more.There are also different ""skill shots"", that depends on the way you kick an adversary's ♥♥♥, and rewards you with cool explosions, xp, an epic voice anouncing your shot, and the right to brag a little and feel great.There's a lot of things I'm probably forgetting, but all in all, this game is insanely fun, highly playable for an early access, easy to learn, and the community is great.Special mention to Erik, the Dev. Great guy and really invested in Disco Dodgeball. You'll probably find him kickin' some ♥♥♥ in the game from time to time!			"

												**Key was donated from the developer to review**   Introduction            Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball may give the idea of a cheap indie game that’s goal is to just take your money, but this is not the case. I didn’t expect much going into this game and was incredibly surprised with the amount of polish and depth in this game. Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball has nearly every feature I like to see in games like this and more. (See “pros” list for a more list of the cool features) The first thing you will notice once you open Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is the amazing soundtrack, and if the techno dance music isn’t your thing you can add your own music. Along with the soundtrack the visual style goes perfectly with this type of music and will get nearly anyone hyped up to play. While playing solo I had tons of fun and the challenges were great, but I did have some problems with connections on the online multiplayer. People were teleporting around, but I do think this was due to those players connections. Overall, I would highly suggest everyone to check this game out.-HiPFiRED   Pros

												Arena shooters is not a genre that has received much love in the recent years. 1999 spawned the best two games of that category, Quake 3 and Unreal Tournament, and since then there have been little to no changes to the formula. Unambitious games with little tweaks on Quake 3 and new coats of paint on Unreal Tournament.Strangely, the most unique spin on the arena shooter formula comes from this game with a ridiculous title: Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball. Instead of weapons there are insta-kill balls to throw (they can be caught), and the movements are on wheels which give some momentum, fluidity and... skill. Predicting trajectories and movements while aiming and moving leaves room for a lot of exciting action, rewarded by a commentator naming the specific skill shot (""flying squirrel!""""zombie!"" ""quick draw!"").The fluidity of the game itself ties in with the atmosphere. There is some cool electro/techno music playing while panels and lights on the levels change color according to the beat and the movement of players. Really enthralling.Even if the game has a huge skill ceiling, just playing casually for fun is entirely possible and can even be relaxing. Bots on easy are good for that. There are tons of game modes. Arcade with permanent progression for solo play, and then variants of deathmatch, race, hold a ball to score points, and throwing a ball in hoops to score points. Mutators can be applied to modify the game, and power-ups can be turned on or off.I will now go over the two main issues of the game. The first one is that... well it's a small indie game so there are not many people playing online, and even less if you are not in North America. Still, one or two servers up are enough to have some fun, but the game would definitively benefit from a population boost (and it deserves it). Then the second issue, the netcode is not too good and lag can be a real problem, especially for those like me having to play against people in another continent. Apparently the developer is working on that and also intends to keep adding features to the game!As a conclusion, Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is a unique arena shooter that is a pleasure to play, at any level. It feels complete and neatly designed, and yet it is the work of only one developer! A nice little surprise, give it a spin!			"

												This game is like if Tron, Unreal/Quake, and Dodgeball Advance had a child.+ Game is super fun+ Soundtrack is great+ A good variety of game modes to make sure it doesn't get stale+ You can even customize your robot a bit with mustaches and sunglasses!- A lot of flashing neon lights which can be annoying for some- Game can get frustrating while trying to adjust to the controls/physicsDefinitely worth the buy if you're looking to play a game that's just fun, no DLC required. 9.5/10			"

Pros:- Great Multiplayer Component with countless gamemodes.- Great Singleplayer Component with gamemodes such as horde, arcade and more.- Fun gameplay.- Strong replayability.- Good amount of customization.- Upbeat and fun soundtrack.- Nice colorful graphics.- Developer is super cool, dedicated, and listens to feedback.- Bots are pretty strong.Cons:- NoneFinal Verdict:This has to be one of the best games to come out of Steam Greenlight and Early Access! Everything about the game is fantastic. If you enjoy multiplayer you'll love this game, if you enjoy high replayability singleplayer games you'll enjoy the game aswell. This game is well worth more then the $15, for a indie game this game surpasses most multiplayer FPS games. Overall I cannot recommend this game more. Well worth the money. 10/10.			"

												Well here I am, my 80th birthday and my wife has seen fit in our budget for me to afford one of those nice new indie games on Steam. Well here I am on Steam and I come across a colorful lookin' game on sale. My eye doctor said that vivid colors would be good for my vision. So my wife said ""what the heck is that?"" and I said it's ""dodgeball"" and so she said alright.I thought I'd ask the man that made the game his opinion on it and he seemed like a pretty nice guy.http://steamcommunity.com/app/270450/discussions/0/617328415077052066/Well mannered I thought, and seemed like the hard workin' type to have made this game on his own.So I get the game and I start it up and my wife is over there knitting some mittens for the grandkids when this noise started banging out of the computer speakers. Startled us at first but then I thought it sounded kinda nice. I started movin' in places I haven't moved since my younger days and so I got up and got to moving. My wife said she was physically attracted to me for the first time in years.Thank you Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball for saving my marriage.10/10 would cut the rug again.UPDATE: Okay kids, you wanted a more helpful review and now since grandpa has had some time with the game, I can give some insight about the actual thing!1. It's great! It has helped my eyesight, just like the doctor ordered. The graphics are what you see and they look great.2. There is a learning curve but it's very rewarding once you get good at it! For instance, if you're used to shooters, you might find yourself hitting the reload button from time to time in this game for no reason. You gotta pick up a ball to be armed kid!3. HOOPS!!!! Best game mode ever, reminds me of my days playing along side the famous Bill Russell. Plenty of other game modes too if you want to try something else.4. The single player arcade mode is a terrific place to practice. It's also pretty fun too.5. It's just a really friendly community, what's the last game you played where people were saying ""Wow! Great game guys!"" or ""Nice moves!"" instead of ""git gud"" or ""you suck!"" Also, there's a neat kudos system in place where you can compliment opponents in real time with the press of a key! Nice!6. Logging into the game at 3am (don't tell my wife!) and you'll still find people online playing, so for an online indie game, the community is thriving pretty well.			"

Flashy Arcade-Style Fun!An Early Access game that graduated with flying colours.Let me start this review off by saying I've got 97 games on Steam and this is my most played game.  If that doesn't peak your interest, feel free to read on.Intro:This game is special.  When I say ""special"" I don't mean mentally handicapped, I mean it's genuinely unique and a real diamond in the rough.  For the price, this may be the best value you can find on Steam.  It may be pretty simple in concept but trust me when I say that this game can entertain for hundreds of hours.  Did I mention it's one of the (very) few games that's done Early Access right and actually seen a solid release?Visuals:Let's start with the visuals.  Erik has done a fantastic job creating exactly what you'd expect from the game's tongue-twister of a title.  Beautiful futuristic Disco arenas that pulsate and flash to the incredible soundtrack.  Goofy-looking one-wheeled bots zoom around the arenas and explode in Michael Bay-esque fashion.  Not only is it beautiful to look at, but it runs well on just about any PC as you can see by the recommended system requirements.  The visual fidelity of this game is only matched by it's stellar gameplay.Gameplay:You know that feeling when you're playing a game and you make the perfect move or take the perfect shot and it feels like you're a god?  You can experience that feeling over and over in this game with it's fast-paced gameplay and tight mechanics.  RRDDD has a learning curve that allows new players to jump in and have a good time without being punished but takes time and effort to master.  The implementation of trick shots adds a whole new dimension to the gameplay.  Pulling off a ""Godlike KO"" for the first time feels... well, Godlike.  There's also an impressive variety of arenas, gamemodes, and unlockable gear to enjoy.  Disco Dodgeball is even better when you hop online and play with your friends!  This game can potentially be endless hours of fun.  My only current issue with the gameplay is that every now and then, there are some bugs regarding balls not being in the same place for different players during online play but hopefully this will be fixed in a future patch and isn't exactly ""game-breaking"".Audio:The soundtrack in RRDDD is one of the best soundtracks to any game I've ever played.  It's the perfect audible theme for the setting.  If you enjoy electronic music, you'll surely appreciate the selection of tracks here.  Accompanied by the top-notch sound effects and the hilarious ""monster truck announcer"" that somehow doesn't ever get old or annoying, it's easy to enjoy the sound in Disco Dodgeball.Conclusion:Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is a real treat for anyone who likes over the top, fast-paced action and isn't afraid to take a few balls to the face.  Erik Asmussen has truly outdone himself and I'm excited to see what he comes up with next.  I can't recommend this game enough.10/10This is my first review.  Please be gentle ;)			"

												This is a fast-paced first-person dodgeball game from the future complete with robots, an (amazing) voiced announcer, and synced visualizers for the music.At its core this is a game I *highly* recommend for those that enjoy the FPS (especially instagib) genre, but want something a bit different... yet still familiar. I won't be so bold as to say a digital dodgeball game has never been made before, but this is the first I've ever played to really go all out with it. It's so brilliantly simple, yet took this long until someone decided to make it... AAA marketing departments: fire yourselves.NOTE: THIS GAME HAS A DEMO YOU CAN TRY! So... try it! (I don't know if it's up to date... but the gameplay is the same regardless)Graphics:I love them! The best way to describe them is ""a minimalist TRON-themed rave"". The music plays a big part as the level coloring/brightness/etc. is hooked up to a visualizer system. Different music will give you a different feel, but no matter what you listen to it's a pleasure to experience. And you can always turn off the visualizer completely (and individually configure most other aspects) if you're not a fan of the effects.Sound:Fantastic! The voice announcer is *amazing* and the default music is absolutely sublime if you're into electronica. Of course, if you don't like the music you can always add your own. The in-game visualizers will automatically adjust, and you'll be rocking out to your own tunes in no time. The only downside (which is a Unity limitation) is that you *have* to use OGG or WAV format. You can very easily use VLC or Audacity to convert your MP3s to OGG though, so it's not a big issue.Controls:For the most part they are your standard WASD+mouse. HOWEVER, the robot you are playing as is intentionally able to slide around as if on ice (though you can still quickly change directions or use ""E"" to stop completely). Also, jumping has no air-control and is based on a charge-up system. While some may see these as limitations, I absolutely love it! It makes jumping a risky move because your trajectory will be predictable, and big jumps will need planning because you may not be charged enough to make it.Modes:LOTS of modes are included, and tons are planned. You have your standard DM/CTF-style modes, but plenty of others to keep you interested. One of my favorites is the ""hoops"" mode, where you are basically playing basketball *while* playing dodgeball. It's REALLY fun, frantic, and ripe for strategic play. There is also an Arcade mode to try and survive (where you go through pre-configured rounds with bosses, and can buy upgrades in between), as well as Challenges that are extremely fun. Both Arcade and Challenges have leaderboard support if you're into that.Gameplay:From the plethora of modes and maps, to the good-sportsmanship-encouragement via the ""kudos"" system, everything about the gameplay is fantastic. There are all kinds of moves to pull off (which the game tracks and gives you a great voiced announcement upon success), an arbitrary leveling system for those that like to feel satisfaction in their progress, a silly and unique character customization system, and just generally a ton of things to enjoy!Singleplayer/Multiplayer:This game has some pretty amazing bots for singleplayer, and those bots can be used as placeholders in multiplayer games (they'll be replaced by real players as they join and do *not* take up a player slot). Multiplayer is the only issue with this game as latency makes catching/blocking/dodging/etc. balls fairly unreliable. It is a known issue, and I have confidence it'll be fixed in the future. That said, the bots are good enough to give you a LOT of play time. Multiplayer can be a bit frustrating, but isn't unplayable... it just takes some getting used to.In the end this is a fantastic game that I really enjoy. The developer (who is ONE person) is on top of everything when it comes to bugfixes, is receptive to suggestions, and even has a public Trello for transparent development. As with any game it isn't for everyone (and isn't playable for gamers with various disabilities due to its nature, see comments), but I HIGHLY recommend it.			"

Early Access Review
								Definately one of the better examples of Early Access done right. Regular updates, a very involved dev are what the game has going for it on the outside. Inside the game, you have maps and gameplay that may evoke a sense of nostalgia for fans of old arena FPS games. RRDDD sports a kickass soundtrack that brings with it both pumping beats to get you into a fugue of awareness and dodge ready, and softer tracks to wind you down when you need a breather. The Gameplay is fast and so are your armaments, dodgeballs. All hits are one hit kills, no health, no second winds. Catches, Long Distances, Flying Squirrel are just a few of the trick shots you can pull off. Perhaps you could even become God-like in the good variety of gamemodes.For a low price you can have a lot of fun bashing in your fellow mustachioed robots's chasis in with discoball dodgeballs online. Is it silly? Perhaps. Is it fun? Definately.			"

												I was quite skeptical seeing all the positive reviews while seeing the mediocre gameplay.  All the lights and effects seemed like goofy attempt at covering up the junk underneath.But after getting the 4-pack during a sale and playing with some buddies, I came right back and bought a few more.  For those that enjoy arena shooters, this is an arena shooter done right.  Every shot that hits feels so satisfying, I crave to play more.The only major downside is the steps it takes to actually set up a LAN party.  Due to the limited experience of the lonely dev, he resorted to 3rd party technology, thus the requirement to download a server program from an external website and a bit of tweaking before one can play with friends, even if everyone is on the same router.After having done so, I see it is relatively easy despite the daunting number of steps on the wiki, so don't be afraid to give it a shot.Also surprisingly, playing solo with bots is actually pretty darn fun too.  Don't let the flashing lights blind you, this game delivers a very solid package.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys arena shooters.			"

												I havn't played a game that got me this excited for many years.  It's so energetic and exciting and kinda rekindles how games used to feel for me when I was younger.  It's a lot of fun and definitely worth picking up.  You and everyone else are robots that zip around various different rooms and try and blow each other up with dodgeballs.  It's fast paced, and me and some friends have been playing it together lately.  Me and one other in particular pull some crazy stunts against each other, it's great.  The level designs are great, there are quite a few game modes to choose from.  The soundtrack is really good.  There are powerups you can pick up around the room as well that will effect your movement or the dodgeball.  You can play with real people and/or bots.It's just pure awesome.  Really refreshing title here.  Worth every penny, if I spent a penny on it (it was gifted to me).			"

Early Access Review
								This game is one of those rare gems that comes along and puts everyone on a level playing field.  The concept is so humorous alone that the game just oozes good vibes.  You can really see how much the developer loves both his game and the game's community in this one.  It's perfect for both casual play and competitive sport.  In fact I have not met or seen a person yet who has played this game and has not had a good time.The graphics on this game are simple but they suit it.  The designs of the different arenas really compliment the fact that you're a robot with one wheel rolling around.  The pulsing and moving lights really sell the idea that you're a night-club arena and the soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard to a game.  Visually the game gives you what you need, and none of the fluff.  This is why Super Mario Bros. was so popular.  Visually it was nothing like we have today but it was fun to play!The game does have an experience points system, but it's geared towards getting cosmetic upgrades, not towards making you more powerful.  I like this because it means new players have chances to improved without constantly getting slaughtered.  Also like many multiplayer games, there's sometimes lag, but with 4 to 12 people throwing dodgeballs around in every direction imaginable, it's so much fun and so chaotic that nobody really seems to mind!You know a game is fun when you're laughing and yelling at your friends over voice chat, having a great time even when you're losing!  It's definitely one of my favorite games of all time; I highly recommend it for one of the best times you will have with your friends, ever, online.			"

								There isn't a single flaw that I've encountered whilst investing time into RRDDD.  Hands down the best investment I've made on Steam up to date.- Robot Customization- Diverse Game Modes (Deathmatch, Superball, Hoops, Elimination)- Single/Multiplayer Options With Bots Available.- Beast Soundtrack.- Rankings/Leveling.- Vibrant/Beautiful Maps.11/10[RIFT] Darth			"

												This is another hidden gem on steam that would give Ricochet a run for it's money. Robot Roller Dodgeball is dodgeball that knows no boundaries and puts everyone playing at risk. Such an extremely simple ""FPS"" game made with care and precision.In Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball, you control one robot whose face you can customize. The controls are relatively simple and require precision aiming more than anything. Think of CS : GO type of game-play movement and that's essentially what you get. The catch? Your robot is on one wheel always rolling around somewhere. There are primarily nine directions you can direct your robot in, all in which will move it at a constant speed. This clonky directional movement can be interrupted and perfected thanks to the mouse. To shake-up the game and to keep it away from being bland they added a jump feature (which you can hold down longer for a bigger jump) and a boost feature, in which both are extremely handy. The game has more game modes than I have fingers on one and possibly two hands. My favorite game feature is their incorporation of basketball or ""hoops"" as they call it. The player can hit other players with the dodge ball, but there is one golden ball that needs to be used to score a point. To do so, the player has to throw the ball on one side of a square floating in mid air by the other teams spawn point. There is also a free for all setting for the mode. Other game modes feature (team) deathmatch, score battle (first team/person/robot to x amount of points), elimination where one by one team members get knocked out and wait for the next round, super ball where players have to keep hold of a certain ball to accumulate points, grand prix where players have to race around a map, horde (single player) where you face up against one robot (then two, then three etc...), and finally training. Any game willing to add variation deserves some credit, and disco dodgeball definitely deserves a high five or two. Besides game modes, players can pick up random power-ups found spread out throughout the map. Some power ups include larger ball, fire/laser ball where it can't be stopped, jet pack to stay in the air longer, boomerang balls, and even a super boost that replenishes boost a lot quicker. How do you pick up a dodgeball? You'll find them laying around everywhere after people start throwing them. They are pretty hard to miss as white globes on the floor will glow brightly. They've also put in a feature where you can CATCH a dodgeball. It's a hard skill to master as you have to point at the ball but results in an opponents quick death. Throwing power can be modified the longer the mouse button is held down. This is useful if you'd like to ricochet your ball off a wall to hit someone on the other side of it. Graphics themselves are a nice twist and keep everything simplistic. There is nothing wrong with being simple as it keeps the focus towards the game. If you are sensitive to a bunch of different lights going on and off you might want to take some precaution. Sounds themselves are neat, subtle and sort of quiet, but neat. The music is what protrudes the most at all times. One thing I noticed graphically was when hitting an opponent with a ball, instead of the opponent blowing up or the ball stopping in it's tracks, there's a little recoil when hitting an opponent, then they blow up. This is a tiny feature that makes hitting an opponent with a ball that much more rewarding. The price is a bit steep I must say but if a sale comes around, I'd say pick it up! Also, for the wary, the servers are sort of empty at times but there are bots to keep it interesting. You will find some stragglers once in a while playing.

												Remember a silly game called ""Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars""?That became Rocket League.Now, this game has a likewise silly title and a ridiculous concept, but I pray that one day the dev will make ""Robot League"" and it'll become an international success because this game is crazy fun.You're a robot on a wheel; you slide across the arena and try to pick up balls to toss against other robots to make them explode. This simple concept is applied to a plethora of game modes (FFA/Team/Elimination/CTF/Hoops/Race/...) and, coupled with the flashy graphics and amazing soundtrack, manages to keep the experience fresh for that ""just 5 more minutes"" effect at 2am.You might not see a huge amount of players on the charts but don't be fooled: I was having fun with as little as 10 players ""playing now"", plus the bots are surprisingly competent.9.5/10 - A purely skill-based arena ""shooter"" with quick & furious matches and a non-toxic community.

												This game is THE ♥♥♥♥. Very fun, bots are fun to play against if you're having trouble finding online games, it has customizable game modes, simple mechanics, the physics based movement is fun to play with, and the game is aestheticelly pleasing. Definitely worth the money.I have very few minor complaints about it:- The UI could use a little polishing- The game is a bit stingy when it comes to customization unlocks. Drop rated for crafting parts is pretty low, but thankfully you can buy parts in the communnity market for cheap.- The sliding mechanic is a little weird; it doesn't seem to offer anything in terms of advanced movement outside of recharging your boost (whch is all I use it for)pro/con - You can save replays, and they are directly saved as .gif files, which is really nice. The bad thing is, the gifs are short, so it's hard to capture cool moments perfectly. I reccommend binding the replay capture button to the 'q' key (Default F5)Please don't let these few downsides turn you away from this game. It's quite an experience.			"

Early Access Review
								I was fortunate enough to win a copy of this game in a giveaway, and I was very happy to have had a chance to experience the awesomeness found within this crazy, intense game.If you like first-person competitive gameplay, dodgeball, electronic dance music (EDM), and vibrant, colorful battlefields, then you will really enjoy this game.The aesthetics are fantastic - each level is basically a light-show-heavy rave, further enhanced by a very good electronic dance music tracklist. I especially loved the fact that the track playing in the menu screen would continue as the in-game music (something that I really appreciate because I don't have to desynch to the music when a new track suddenly interrupts the one you had been initially listening to). You can customize your robot character's appearance a fair amount, with the option to unlock more pieces as you level up your account. The announcer's praise for unique moves you do (ex: air hits, bounce hits, denials, etc) adds to the intensity of the game, which is reminiscent of the fast-paced action typically experienced in games like the Unreal and Quake series'.  The controls are easy to grasp and helpful pop-up tutorials remind you of your keybindings for things like e-braking, boosting, etc. The learning curve is minimal to moderate, depending on your experience with first-person combat. Even against easy bots in singleplayer, you will have a very fun and challenging time familiarizing yourself with the game. During combat, you truly need to appreciate battlefield awareness because it is extremely easy to be hit from behind by a dodgeball. Furthermore, carelessly throwing your ball at an opponent may result in a catch, with auto-kills you and (even worse) brings back a downed opponent. You cannot catch twice in a row (you must throw a ball to reset your catch allotment), and this helps ensure that people do not simply camp and wait for their opponents to throw the first ball. There are a variety of different levels, each with their own distinct layout that may result in you changing up your strategy (for example, one level consists of many pillars, so weaving in and out to dodge/juke your opponents attacks is a much more viable strategy here than, say, a level with large, open ground.Pickups also litter the battlefield, adding advantages like homing dodgeballs, a temporary jetpack, fast/tighter maneuverability, or even laser (straight) shots. The powerups are random (much like Mario Kart's mystery powerups), so you may have to pick several up before you end up acquiring your favorite one. My personal favorite is the jetpack, since it really helps you achieve those beautiful ""death from above"" hits.For many players, the combination of fast, upbeat EDM and color/light-intensive maps may be a turn off, as it can be a lot of noise for people more used to average-paced games (or even just average-paced presentation of stimuli). If this does not bother you, however, you will be in for quite a treat. The color/lights in the maps will change periodically in timing with the music, and I see a lot of potential here for further optimization of game music with game aesthetics (visual). I am hoping for an option of playing your own music in the future (I'd love to listen to one of my EDM mixes while watching the levels give a great lightshow while playing dodgeball).There are a multitude of game modes - like team elimination, score attack, hold the dodgeball - that help keep the game fresh and entertaining. The community, at least from what I have seen, is both very friendly and helpful to newcomers. If you are able to play this game with a few friends, you will have a lot of fun.Overall, if you are interested in fast-paced dodgeball with wonderful aesthetics, you must give this game a try. There is definitely a high amount of potential for this game to grow and develop, and I look forward to seeing the end product.Highly recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												Upon reading the title, three things can be learnt about this game.1) It has robots.2) It involves disco.3) It's about dodgeball.And if there's anything this game is guilty of, living up to expectations is not one of them. Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is a competitve primarily multiplayer first person shooter filling the fairly empty and unexplored niche of a dodgeball game, one I'm frankly suprised nobody thought of before. GAMEPLAYGameplay is easy to learn; find a dodgeball, hold the mouse to shoot (""Oh, but what about controllers?"" you may ask. Take a moment and reread my description of the game. This is not a game you should use a controller for.). Left click to drift, left shift to boost, collect powerups to get powers. Satisfying callouts from the game announcer sound when you hit a certain killstreak value or perform a certain type of kill, such as a 'dunk' or 'helicopter'. Simple enough, right? However, it holds true to the adage, as even with a considerable amount of time in Disco Dodgeball I'm far from mastering it. For instance, I largely ignored the drifting mechanic until recently, and found that it is extremely effective for sharp turns and desperate speed boosts. CUSTOMIZATIONOne of the reasons I left out 'team based' in my intial summary of Disco Dodgeball is due to the massive amount of game mode customization extant. Even putting 'primarily multiplayer' was risky, as the game has a horde and arcade mode, which have you pitted against endless waves of bots or battling through a more structured, level-based gauntlet, complete with purchasable augments. However, multiplayer is the star, and the gameplay settings make it shine. Several different game modes, including Hoops, which is similar to basketball, or Elimination, which channels Counter-Strike's 'one death and you're out' mantra are side by side with the standard deathmatch. Free For All modes are availible for most modes, and you even have the ability to choose starting powerups. Along with these are the standard goofy options like 'Big Head' mode, which speaks for itself, and low gravity.SETTINGSDisco-Dodgeball suprised me with how deep it's settings are at launch. If anyone reading this played the very early versions of the game, then you'll remember the unchangable 60 FOV, as well as only having the standard 'Good-Fantastic' Unity drop down bar within the launcher. Now you can change pretty much everything, including AA, Vsync, FOV, and Alien FX, which from what I've heard makes your AlienWare PC light up in sync with the game''s pulsating lights. Speaking of which...AESTHETICS AND MUSICThis is where I feel like the game defines itself in the gaming world, besides the unique concept. Launching the game, you're immediately hit with the game's energetic and pumed electronic music, as well as a display of it's neon glowing visuals. The enviroment interacts with the music, dimming when the volume or tempo drops and bursting with light when a piece hits it's apex. However, I imagine that the game could be problematic for those with certain medical issues due to the quick flashing lights.PROBLEMSThe only real problem I have with the game is the occasional physics quirk. Sometimes you'll get shot up into the air after a collision with another player of object, which, coupled with the slow fall speed, makes you a sitting duck.COMMUNITYNot once have I heard an angry remark in the chat, even though I have been seething with frustration after getting Ninja'd by somebody for the 5th time. Disco Dodgeball has one of the nicest, healthiest communities I've ever encountered in a game, in part due to it's small player base, but also due to the built in kudos system, a way to quickly condone somebody if they've made a great hit on you.SUMMARYRobot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is what it says on the tin: fast paced, energetic, and fun. You would be hard pressed to find a community that's nicer, and the innumerable game modes and customizations will have you playing until 1:30 AM on a school night, which has just happened to me.

												This is a fun, underrated Arena FPS with unique mechanics that provide something new for shooter fans.  The vibrant colors, heart-thumping tunes, and split-second reaction style gameplay make for a super enjoyable ball-dodging experience!The online community is small but surprisingly active for a non-mainstream title, but you can also play with bots or local splitscreen if you are so inclined.  There are a whole slew of gamemodes that help keep things fresh, in addition to conventions you are used to like Deathmatch and Capture the Flag.  Do not buy this game if you are expecting some kind of story mode, any single player experience to be had in this game will come in the form of bot matches.  They can be surprisingly fun and diverse, so even if bots aren't your thing its still definitely worth a look.  I got this game for $1 in a Humble Bundle a while back, and given the opportunity I would definitely pay more for it.  At $1.99 currently in the 2016 Steam Autumn Sale, its hard to beat the value you get in return for that much.  Don't think twice, especially if you're looking for a versatile, unique Arena FPS that is friendly for people of all ages and play experience.			"

Early Access Review
								   Easily game of the year. This game has so much more to it than meets the eye. I began playing this game in beta, and it was amazing! It has easy mechanics, easy objectives, and unfathomable entertainment. There are so many things that I love about this game.   First off, unlike most other fps games, it's balanced. All players are equal, and when you die, there's no excuses. The other player was either better than you, or was able to use the map and powerups better than you. It's straight forward hit or miss gameplay. Also, the powerups are balanced. The big balls will help you hit more robots, but they are so much easier to see, and unlike the homing and laser, you can't hide having the powerup. When you're holding a ball, it's always big and noticable. The homing is amazing against bots at long range, but is so much harder to use close up. Also, when you lose it, you're so used to seeing the tracker that it disorientates you for a moment. Laser is fast and great for ricochets, but it messes up the way you're used to playing, being the ball has no drop. Jetpack is great for capturing points or swooping in like an eagle, but you can lose vertical momentum, making yourself an easy target. Pogo is good for navigation, but if you fumble, you're an easy midair target. Super boost is great for hit and runs, but really hurts your finger pressing shift. I find that when you use superboost, you start going in a lap pattern, which makes you a predictable target. You also get disorientated in close combat. The balance in this game makes it such a more entertaining game because you're just as capable as the rest of your team to achieve the objectives.   Second, the soundtrack. Where do I even start. It's amazing, and really is. The game wouldn't be the same without it. Hell, I'm a person that doesn't even like dubstep, and I can't play this without the music. It just gets you in the mood to kick ♥♥♥, or just stop and listen to it. Best soundtrack of any game I've seen (or heard).   Third, the simplicity. At first glance, you may think you'll just be getting into some futuristic, complicated sports shotter with a ton of exposition. The title alone is complicated! But when you start playing, you realize just how simple it is. There's some balls. Go get a ball. Take that ball and hit that jerk over there in the face with it. Oh, by the way, keep killing those guys so your team wins. Or be fancy about smashing their smug toaster of a head open, because you're getting points for that. It's easy to learn, easy to master. I've never played a multiplayer game like that before. THe only real thing that separates experts from beginners is knowing your keys and mouse.   Finally, my favorite thing about this game is the development. It's ridiculous. Like I said, I started this in beta, and now it's ready for launch in a little under a year. Erik's the hardest working dev I think there is. Here's some new maps you can try out. Some more gamemodes. Here, a ton of more graphics options! Fixed some bugs that were reported 2 hours ago. Want singleplayer? Here's singleplayer! Hell, when 3.2 came out, I remember joking about 3.7 coming out. And it's now here! After a few short months, you've made 5 milestones in the development of Disco Dodgeball! Congratulations! Not only have you evolved, re-evolved, and revolutionized the game itself over and over again, but you've done something which is what all devs should do. You listen to your community. You actively engage with us to find what we want to see in your game. Is this causing lag? Fixed. Want more gamemodes? There you go. Catching too easy? No problem. You've even made a demo for players to try it out for free! I've gotta say, this wouldn't be nearly as fun of a game if Erik wasn't such a great developer.   So what are you waiting for? Get the game! You will not regret it. It will probably make you a better person, and help with stress. Better hurry, friday's only once a week! In case you don't know, we have game nights and tournaments every week! You'll quickly get a good group of friends from the community. You'll meet new people, and have a ton of fun hitting them in the face with an exploding dodgeball! What's not to like? Doesn't matter, Erik will fix it!			"

Yay!+Graphics: Easy on the eyes, easy on your machine.+Customization: May be grindy, but who cares? You'll love the game for itself.+Gameplay: Holy damn is this game fun! Just try it!+Variety: There is a wealth of gameplay modes for every mood! (No, really, every mood)Cons- Can be buggy- Sticky terrainNeutral+/- Players with a poor connection can still play (but warp everywhere and can't be hit.)======================================Yes. Robot Roller Derby Disco Dodgeball. Robot Roller Derby Disco Dodgeball is a game about robots rolling around dodging balls in a disco-rave environment. You will dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge until your parents yell at you to please just stop playing that epilepsy simulator. The game is a treat, aesthetically and otherwise, but especially aesthetically. Let me explain: The environment is beautiful, but also essentially a giant equalizer with pretty flashing colors. The music, of course, is not only in sync with said equalizenvironment, but very pleasing to the ears. It gets you going, and keeps the game going. The gameplay is gloriously colorful high octane fun! The controls have a momentum to them, and may take some adjustment. Shooting isn't per pixel where the crosshair is, which is good. The ball may bounce off the edge of a hoop or narrowly miss your opponent until you really learn to aim well. You'll also be pleased to hear you can catch and block the ball, not just dodge! There are CTF, king of the hill, and many other gamemodes to keep you occupied. Now, on the other hand, I did encounter some problems. But only some! Very very few even...but they should be mentioned. First off, in my first few times trying to play, I ran into a wealth of strange settings bugs. No steam overlay, couldn't get into gamemode. Then that worked, but the controller wouldn't look around. Restart again, controller works, but can only change the sensitivity with the mouse. The only other issue besides the ocassional bug (that I only ever had at the very beginning, all smooth now!) is the sticky terrain. You will get stuck on the corner of a ramp, or even on players, because the game kind of defaults to jumping you when you do. Probably because of that sweet momentum!So keep on rollin', folks, and remember to dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge!======================================If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

								I bought Disco Dodgeball on Erik's website back in February. I must say it is an amazing game made by an amazing developer. Any time I tweet out at Erik he responds 99.99% of the time. He is very active with the community. I've played this game way more than my Steam profile says so. It's a nice twist on the usual FPS. Very refreshing. I highly recommend this game.Oh, and the robots have mustaches. 11/10.Amazing soundtrack too. :)			"

								I've been playing this game since January, and this game has come a long way from where it was a few months ago. The time, effort, and love put into this game is definitely noticeable! From free for all matches, Team modes, over 6 different game types and even a score attack Horde mode, this game has a lot to be proud of!If you like multiplayer games that are fast paced, have lots of different game modes, and even lets you customize your character's looks, this game is for you!

												These days it seems like developers, especially the giant AAA companies, have forgotten why we play video games to begin with:  TO HAVE FUN! THIS GAME NAILS IT.  This game is just pure fun.  It is definitely a throwback. The engine is simple, the physics are fantastic, and... I mean come on its DODGEBALL WITH DANCE MUSIC AND LASER LIGHTS!!!  How the hell can you not enjoy that?I highly recommend buying this, you won't be disappointed.  For 11.99 this game is a steal.			"

								It's unique, fun, and just plain perfect at what it is trying to accomplish. Easily worth the purchase. The music simplistic design and core gameplay carry it and they do so well. I never though a game with robots on one wheel playing dodgeball would be one of the best shooters this year.Being created by only one person is both impressive and surpring. The developer deserves a Nobel Prize. Would buy again.			"

												Incredible game with a very dedicated Dev; he's always working on the game implementing new features and making various other improvements.This game is tons of fun and a very fresh take on the generally dry genre of online FPS.Check out the TotalBiscuit review on youtube for a more in depth look at the game.I'd also like to address the negative reviews stating there is no one online.  As of now (01/12/16) I have never had a probelm finding people online.  The population is quite small, but I've always been able to find active games.  I even played the other day at 7 am and, while numbers were certainly light, there were still a few people playing online.			"

												Some of the best Multiplayer you will find on Steam, no joke. I had seen some early gameplay of this game back when it was in Early Access and I was hesitant to get it, it looked interesting but seemed very bare and limited at the time. At full release I couldn't be happier with how the game turned out. The environments are bright, colorful, and work great for the gameplay. The soundtrack is amazing and the game plays really smooth. I was very impressed with how well the mechanics feel when it comes to throwing and catching the balls. This game also has a single player mode, for those times when your friends aren't in the mood to play! I would give this a solid 8/10, I wouldn't say it's perfect but it is a must play for me			"

												Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball. The title is quite ridiculous. And so is its gameplay! Playing this, it makes you think, ""Why hasn't this been done?"" The whole concept is quite simple, and the execution is solid. With it's cartoony robots rolling around neon environments, it kind of gives the player a sense of what is really supposed to be had. Fun, and lots of it. The game has great singleplayer modes, such as arcade in which you are put up against multiple waves of enemies on each level, with only five lives to spare. After each level, you are given money to purchase powerups to get to the next, and trust me, you'll need em. Multiplayer is quite unique. With different modes, such as  Super Ball (similar to Oddball in Halo), Hoops (basically basketball), Elimination (""classic"" Dodgeball), and plenty more, there is enough variety to keep a single player, or a group of friends entertained for hours. The community is small, but everyone I've seem to have met has been nothing but nice to me. Unlike hardcore shooters such as CS:GO, the atmosphere promotes kindness as odd as it may seem. I attribute it to the cutesy asthetic and lack of push to talk. As for the performance, there is A LOT of lighting effects. On my machine (just a Macbook Pro with some decent upgrades, nothing fancy AT ALL), I have to disable most of them, but any decent PC will be able to enable most if not all of the settings. Now, the only flaws I can find are in multiplayer, the biggest being netcode. Catches seem to work rarely, and hit registration can be iffy. I'm sure these may be ironed out in future updates, but for now, we just have to sit and bear it. Do I reccomend this game? Yes, absolutely. It is one of my definitive multiplayer experiences of 2014 and 2015, simply because there is nothing like it, and it is a whole lot of fun.			"

												I felt like rewriting my original review because I think it isn't in-depth enough so here's a longer one.Robot Roller-Derby Disco DodgebalI cannot recommend this game enough. I got it yesterday during on sale for 9 bucks. Right from the start I was having a blast with it. I was having so much fun in fact I had to buy my buddy a copy so he could jump in as well.The game plays more like a classic arena FPS than a modern FPS but instead of turning other players into giblets you're throwing dodgeballs at them. There are many unusual mechanics that add to the game a lot. For instance sprinting is called 'boost' and after you use boost you have to let it recharge back to %100. Jumping doesn't just require taping the spacebar but also holding it. The longer you hold it the higher (or farther) you jump, it also has a 100% meter so you have to let it charge to use it again. Once you have a dodgeball in your hand you can throw it by holding and releasing the right mouse button. Charging it up to 100% makes the shot as strong as it can be. The left mouse button is used to power slide (think drifting). To power slide you hold forward, lmb, and turn towards a certain angle so you can't power slide just by moving forward. While power sliding your boost meter charges up quicker and you can even overcharge it giving you a faster boost. Besides throwing the dodgeball you can also catch, catching it automatically eliminates the person who threw it like in real dodgeball.Moving around is also quit different from other shooters. Since your not a bipedal human but a single wheel robot you can strafe as fast as you can walk forward and backwards but once you press w,s,a, or d you will move in that direction till you press another movement key or press the brakes button (e is default key). So basically if you press forward you will continue moving forward until you stop or move elsewhere.Just like a classic arena FPS you have an announcer announcing crazy kill combo you just had (double kill, multikill, ramapge). Besides getting extra points for racking up kills you also get extra points for doing trick shots and the announcer would say it as well. These include ricochet (hit a guy indirectly) dunk (hitting a guy underneath you midair) and long shot (the farther the range the more points you get) and plenty more.There are self improving upgrades in the game that can help you out during a match. The power ups are placed around the levels so if you're quick enough you can get one at the very beginning of the match. You can't know what power up you're getting because its random so you can't always get what you want. Some of the power ups include fireball (a blazing dodgeball that can't be caught so its best to avoid it), pogostick (lets you jump higher than normal) and jet pack (lets you hover with the jump button until your jumping gauge is 0% or until all your fuel is depleted). There are many more that I can't name at the top of my head.The electronic dance music also adds a lot to the game. Shooters these days try to present themselves as rough and serious since hearing your enemies footsteps is vital, I totally understand that this a valid reason but I miss the classic multiplayer soundtracks from past shooters (Foregone Destruction anyone?). Having EDM music in the background makes it more... I dunno... soothing? Like I haven't raged quit it this game even in matches where I go 3 and 15. I don't take it to so serious and its ok because I'm still having a blast. Sometimes I even bop to the beat and try to aim my shots when the bass drops or whatever lol but that's just weird ol' me.Multiplayer modes include:Deathmatch: Self explanatory. Score points by getting kills, the more kills the more points.Score Batte: Which ever team scores the most points wins. To get a lot of points its best to do trick shots.Elimination: Just like in real dodgeball, once you're hit you're out. If your teammate catches a ball you can come back in.Hoops: throw dodgeball through enemy hoops to score points, who ever scores the most wins.Super Ball: Hold the ""super ball"" for as long as you can to score points for your team. If a teammate has it you have to defend him. If a enemy has it you have to take it away from them.Grand Prix: you have to race around an arena to get to checkpoints. Leaders earn double points so his effort is vital. Also boost+drifting is key here.If you don't feel like playing multiplayer the single player aspect of the game is also super fun. Modes include:Training: pretty self explanitory, if your a newbie definitely give it a try.Arcade: Beat a group of bots (at the end of three waves or so you have to fight a boss), collect cash, buy upgrades with that cash, and keep playing till you hit game over. You start off with 4 lives but you can gain more later with upgrades. once you deplete all your lives you die.Challenge: Challenge isn't one mode but about 4-5 different modes. I haven't payed them yet but I'll check them out later.Bot match: If you feel like playing an offline match with bots then you can.I haven't let this game go since I bought it yesterday and Its because I've been having so much damn fun with it. My go to FPS is still BF4 right now but unlike BF4 in RRDDD not every match has to be super focus, intense and/or strategic. I feel like a child playing this game because its just simple fast pace fun. I dunno if its nostalgia but playing this game recaptures that same feeling I had when playing UT99 for the very first time and I love it.TL;DR Super fun fast paced Arena FPS Dodgeball game with neon lights and catchy music. Definitely give it a try.Original Review:So I just bought the game and holy crap this is one of the most funnest FPS (if you would call it that) that I've ever played. Let me preface this by saying I play tons of shooters, my main one right now is BF4. Even though I love that game to death there are plenty of frustrating moments with it (getting sniped by some dedicated camper across the map, dying for stupid reasons, admins ruining the momentum of the game when they have to balance things out, etc). This game on the other hand no matter how pro the enemy players are I'm always having fun jumping around and trying to get some hits while at the same time avoid getting hit. Only reason I would put this game down its if I get tired after playing it for hours, I haven't rage quit at all and believe me I tend to rage quit often. I'm loving this game so much I bought one for my buddy as a gift so we can play together. Really if you want to have a super fun time try this game out you will love it!			"

I'm beginning to think I've found a jewel here.Day #3:Disco Dodgeball is taking over my life. I thought Skyrim was bad. I'm playing it all the time during my waking hours. And when I go to bed I'm thinking about playing the next day. I'm dreaming about making helicopter and alley-oop game winning shots. I can't stop.Day #4:Not in my house. Denied. Dunk.

								Massive amounts of fun for a small pricetag.  Very reminiscent of old school instagib in my opinion, just made much more accessible.  Being a ""unicycle"" with very limited boost and jump abilities really helps slow the game down to a very fun manageable pace.  I would imagine beginners would be able to scrap together a few kills and have a good time while veterans are busy slamming the ball off your face with style (mid-air 360s), and are rewarded for that.Great soundtrack and super fun gameplay (even solo with bots, moreso with friends though).The game is early access and beware, there are still some odd bugs like not actually picking up a ball when you may have thought you grabbed it.  There are also issues matchmaking with friends, but I would imagine come release this game will take full advantage of Steam and being able to join/invite friends.			"

												Are you tired of dull and grey military shooters? Are you fed up of micropayments ruining the gameplay? Are you fed up of everything in first person gaming being about shooting a gun constantly? Do you hate the fact that companies with the starting budget of a small country can't even program a decent server browser and shove matchmaking down your throat?Then I'm telling you now to buy this game, it has:. Lots and Lots and Lots of pretty neon lights and particle affects ( There's a reason it's called disco dodgeball ) I don't think even the white balls you pick up have a bit of grey in them. An interesting physics system where you're using literal dodge balls to smash your opponents to pieces, so yes, they ricohet off the walls and everything. Electronic/Dubstep style music. A server browser that doesn't suck and you're not forced to use matchmaking, dedicated servers!. Even though it's practically only been released in the past day or two, normally that's all it takes before backstabbing scumbag devs turn to micropayments and horrible DLC content that breaks the game and splits apart the multiplayer content, so far that doesn't seem to be happening, I hope I don't regret these words later!This was a real breath of fresh air from an incredibly stale market, it's definitely going to be indie developers that are going to carry the way forward when it comes to the games industry, long standing games companies are forgetting what makes a game sell and that's just that it needs to be fun!

												Pros-It's dodgeball-It's really really fun-Lots of easy modification (tons of settings)-You can be a helicopter-When this game is working it is hella fun, reallyCons-Netcode is sometimes unreliable (it is good enough to play usually)-Blocking incoming balls feels more like a random chance than a certainty-Sub-par netcode can result in balls and players teleporting around, causing frustrationOverall it is a good game, and I believe that in time, some issues may be worked out, but currently not worth the price tag.  I would wait for it to come on sale.  It should be about $10 for its quality.  Or i'm just cheap, who knows.  I am enjoying my time with it, but the netcode leaves me wanting more.  As I become better at the game, the faulty netcode hurts me far more than a new player.  When you get better at catching balls and learn how to block, you realise that it is incredibly unreliable.Bottom line: It's still really fun regardless of any cons.  It really is.  I just wish it could be perfect. "

Early Access Review
								As of writin' this review, I've played this game for 2.3 hours, plus it's the 15:th of October, meanin' it's at the time this game is still in development. I've inspected the game throroughly through the sound aspects, graphics and general view of the game(I'm personally not the typical ""strict critic"" who only mentions the flaws). Anyways, let's get to it!Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball(I'll hereby refer to it as simply Disco Dodgeball for convenience) is a simple game based upon the classic school-activity most of us have experienced and loved, dodgeball. However, you are a roller-derby robot! If you haven't been part of it or played another version of it that isn't the typical american style, this is how it works...IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT DODGEBALL IS: Two teams are pitched against each other in a battle to eliminate the opposin' team by picking up the balls on the field and throwin' it on an enemy. Players who are hit are eliminated from the game, however can be brought back in the game if a friendly team member catches the ball thrown from the same enemy that eliminated you. Catching a ball thrown from the enemy while it's still in the air will result in that same enemy player being eliminated. The last man standin' wins.IF YOU KNOW WHAT DODGEBALL IS:Okay, so now you know what dodgeball is(or already have known), the version in this game is slightly different. First of all, there's no border restriction as to where the players from both teams can be at, the entire arena is free for both teams to roam. Secondly, the ball thrown from a player can bounce off of one surface and still eliminate an enemy. Also, as with the usual rules, you can protect yourself if you are holding a ball.MODESOkay, so there's dodgeball. Is that everythin' to it? Actually, no, there are several creative and very competetive gamemodes bundled with the game! There's last-man-standing styled team deathmatch(basically team vs. team with no respawn), there's a ""Super Ball"" mode where one team member has to hold the golden ball for as long as possible and get to the required score to win the game. There's also several single-player challenge modes such as horde, where you are alone and facing endless enemies who are tryin' to eliminate you(the round ends when you are eliminated). There's also Juggernaut, which is a mode where you rack up as many eliminations as possible in a 2-minute duration while completely insincible to thrown enemy balls.GRAPHICSFor such a small game with a simple mechanic, the graphics are incredibly appealin'. Neon-robots, speakers and walls that pump in sync with the music in-game, strobelights and whatnot. As for the options for graphics, it has pretty much a general consumer would need, and a little bit more. You can change things like Vsync, resolution, fog, glow, the music visualizer, gibs and reflections. There's even an option for AlienFX that I presume syncs the light from your Alienware computer with the music from your game. If you have ever been at a night club with pumping loud music, you will definitely recognize that feelin' when playino' this game with all the options turned on(excluding AlienFX).SOUND & MUSICThe sound and musical aspects of this game, just like the graphics, are extremely good! The sounds in itself are very good, you get the feeling that you are really there, what with the dodgeballs bouncing on the floor, the roller-derby tire on your robot body, and the epic announcer who mentions every kill you get like it's your biggest achievement! The music is very fittin' to the games setting as well, with pumpy and well-produced electro music, the kind you hear in clubs. The sound assets of the game can be changed in the options, which offers a slider for effects, voice and music sepparatly. You can also skip a song in the sound options and scroll through the songs available.GENERAL SETTINGSThe game offers customization for people who wants to be known on the battlefield, such as ""the green wariostache guy"". Finally people can go ""That purple sleepy guy keeps killing me!"" when you take em' down. You can customize your robot color, your face(things like multiple moustaches, cat whiskers etc) as well as glasses, and accordin' to the developer, more is to come!There are rebindable control options for gamepad and keyboard+mouse users(However no secondary button for the same action). Now, somethin' this game offers that I have NEVER seen before is rebindable keys for BOTH xbox and Playstation controllers! This also means you can change the sensitivity, as well as invert the Y-axis.You can also adjust your network settings for when you want to play with friends over a local network, or against other people publicly.CONCLUSIONThis game is absolutely fantastic! It is surprisin'ly competetive, and I believe real tournaments can be made for this game. The skillgap is certianly real, and there is very little ""luck"". The hitbox is precise and correct, the bots are well programmed and are certianly there to make gameplay a challenge. There are enough customization options, as well as custom game settings that's able to be made. I would certianly recommend that you and your friends grab a copy of this game(it's 9,99 euros. Can't go wrong with a purchase like that!), you'll have a lot of fun!~Melee			"

												A hidden Gem!RRDDD is shortly put: a dodgeball themed arena shooter in a disco-ish environment, that is highly addictive and made by just 1 Person!The Game has many Modes to choose: from the basic deathmatch and captures, over basketball-ish hoops to racing and teamwork where you can only score by passing to other Teammates and those KOing the Enemy. And the Best? if you get bored by those Modes, you can just create your own match and go completely nuts with around 100 Settings to choose! want a really tough and challenging game? go for it! in for pure Mayhem? just do it!  I made a match with basically every mode put into it with max bots and balls, if that's not chaotic, what is? :P The Game seams pretty simplistic but is so suprisingly fun, it REALLY deserves more attraction and a higher playerbase (it has a good amount of players, but more never hurts). and the fact the dev is continously supporting this great game and is helping the community wherever possible is something waaaay too rarely seen nowadays. Quick Pros and Cons:  Pros:  Highly addictive Gameplay with tons of Modes to choose from Perfectly fitting Soundtrack, which takes some time to get old IMO Announcer adds to the fun dramatically, making it rewarding to see a bot blow to bits and he just taunts: ""go back to the Junkyard!"" Crafting and customisation system: Items will drop during gameplay for your customization / crafting / trading or marketing needs Arenas are diverse and sometimes offer a completely new way to play the exact same mode. MODS!!! so far you can do 3 Things: Change Soundtracks, (requires spotify) Change Bot names (only in SP) and - last but not least - change the announcer's Lines. I'm using the Trump mod pack and I'm absolutely loving it, even though bots tend to grab me someplace, i didn't even know i had? :P  Cons:  Graphics could be better, IF your one of those persons who prefer graphic over anything, than this is the wrong game. But the Gameplay is much more important than stupid graphics and it looks perfectly fine IMHO Controller Support: nothing to complain in SP, but beeing unable to chat or give Kudos in MP is a bit of a downer. Repetetive: YES I ain't gonna lie, with all those modes and the abbility to create your own match, it's still just one and the same thing: some bots tossing balls at each other.Overall this is the way Indie Games should be like. and i can only give kudos to the dev for creating this by himself!My Rating: 9.5 / 10 Must have if you like Arena shooters! ( I don't really like those :P )			"

Early Access Review
								This is a quick, fast-paced, hyper stimulating game of dodgeball. As a robot, you wheel around picking up the neon balls (pretty much everyhing is neon in this game) and throw them at people. Deathmatch and it's team based counterpart are not all this game has to offer however. Superball is a personal favorite of mine, where there is one yellow ball, and the holder gegts one point every second for his team, while his teamates protect him, and enemies try to hit him. The soundtrack is pretty good, and having played from early beta, the developement has come a long way, and I don't see it stopping any time soon. As for the price tag, mehhh. If you think the game looks great, go ahead and buy it, also if you have a couple extra bucks to throw around. But personally, for me, $10 is a little on the high side, I would wait for one of Steams fantastic sales. I got a key through my Humble Bundle page just for having the Beta. This isn't much of a sit down with your friends and play kinda game, so don't expect that either. Usually when I play this game I just log half an hour and then find something else, but it doesn't get boring in the log run, I just don't find it attention grabbing enough that I can sit through an hour long play session. And with 3-10 minute games (depends on the team stacking) I don't think thats too unreasonable. As of the writing of this review, I only have .8 hours on record, but don't be mislead, I got a key from the developer a couple months ago on reddit, so most of my hours are logged on there. Overall, yes it's good and I recommend it, but the price tag does seem a tad high.			"

												Wow. I was not expecting this gem.Where do I begin? I got it last night when my friend finally paid me back, and after a 5-minute install, I booted it up. After tweaking the settings so it'd run smoother, I started the tutorial. No surprise, I sucked. Really, really badly. So, what did I do? I joined a random multiplayer game. And I got wrecked. But I also fluked my way into getting a few kills. Not skillshots, mind you, but kills. Anyways, after about 30 minutes since starting the game I get off to eat dinner. Except, it hadn't been 30 minutes. As I stood up, I glanced at the words next to the 'Play' button. 'YOU'VE PLAYED: 90 minutes' I spent an hour and a half getting blue and/or red dodgeballs thrown at my face by mustachioed, unicycling robots while rocking out to the badass music, and didn't even realise it. And I have to say:11/10Would get balls thrown at my face by robots with mustaches again.If there was a 'Highly Recommended' button instead of a 'Recommend' and 'Don't Recommend', I would use it.

												If you're looking for a game that you can play quickly and still have a lot of fun, this game works well.  +TONS of interesting modes.  Almost all of them are intense and fun.+Play against real people or play against the bots, which I enjoy playing against as well.+Good laughs on some of the ridiculous plays you can make and that happen to you.+Dev is one guy and he seems to care a lot about the game. +The throws just feel right and it you can get lucky, but it requires quite a bit of skill.+Powerups help change things up and keep the game interesting.+There's quite a few ""levels"" to play on.+Graphics for me are lively and fit the game well.On to the things that I believe could be improved:-The jumps feel a bit to floaty for me.  Too easy to get caught midair imo-There's not that many sound tracks.  You could mute and play your own music if you want though of course.-I don't see an option to customize the robot at this point.BONUS: The dev has plans to add a lot to the game.  I don't count it as a plus because you don't know if it will happen, but you can see in his post that he wants to add steam workshop to fix the robot customization problem, a level editor, more powerups, etc.  As the game is at this very moment, I already would wholeheartedly recommend the game at full price.  It's not a AAA release or really flashy, but it is a whole lot of fun, which is what I play games for.  I would currently give this game a 8.5/10 and I will upgrade the score if even more of the features are added.  BUY THIS GAME!			"

								The year is 20,000 AD. Limbless uni-wheeled telekinetic robots now dominate the fields of battle, which have been transformed into neon-colored dance clubs of death! The weapon of choice? Fast-pitched disco balls that explode targets on contact! THIS is Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball, the new futuristic sport of choice!Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is a rare gem indeed. There are few titles in alpha/beta/Early Release that I can say have captivated me from the very start, and this title genuinely grabbed my attention with it's very first concept trailer. Simple in concept yet dastardly difficult to master, Disco Dodgeball is a wonderful throwback to first person shooters of the turn of the millenium. Similar in style to Quake 3 and Unreal Tournament in terms of control, Disco Dodgeball at it's core is a twitch shooter with a funky and captivating aesthetic that is so unlike anything else available on any platform to date. It's also hands down the best and most authentic dodgeball simulator on the market.If you're looking for an inexpensive and fresh title to add to your library, Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is more than a safe bet; it's a must purchase.

												This game is a great twist on an arena fps game.  Everybody plays as a robot running around the arena, picking up balls, throwing them at each other, and getting power-ups.  It's the kind of hilarious chaotic fun that is fantastic for LAN get togethers or big groups of people.  The soundtrack is fantastic, the visuals are bright and the colors of the arena vibrate to the beat of the song that is playing.  It's a simple game with simple mechanics and it is very visually appealing and nicely polished.  There's a single player mode which pits you up against a number of special oppenents to really help you train so you can beat the snot out of your friends later.  It even has it's own steam inventory, so you can collect aesthetic items and trade them with your friends.  If anybody could know that this is a good dodgeball game, it would be me.                 -Patches O'Houlihan			"

												I grabbed a dodgeball mid-air, dunked it on the nearest enemy's head, and the announcer called out ""THAT'S A SPICY MEATBALL!"" That was when I realized RRDDD is my new favorite multiplayer game.Props:- Fast-paced, physics-based, arena ""shooter"" gameplay with surprising depth.- Great variety of game modes. Deathmatch, Elimination, and Capture the Cube are all solid stand-by modes. For me, though, the real gem is Hoops, which is basically basketball mixed with dodgeball. Really fun stuff.- Ridiculously fast load times. Joining a server takes a few seconds (!) on average.- Simple, but impressive, graphics. Neon lights flash and strobe along with the music.- Excellent music (and if it's not to your taste, you have the ability to import and play your own music in-game...and yes, the lights will strobe in time with your custom music too!)- Friendly, welcoming community.- Developer is active, involved on forums, and truly listens to feedback. A real mensch.- Robot mustaches.Slops:- Some latency issues to be resolved. Playing on a dedicated server should fix the issue, but dedicated servers are not publicly searchable at this time. Once they are, RRDDD could become a truly competitive game. But for now, the occasional rubber-banding/collision detection failures will remain a minor annoyance. I really don't want to overstate the issue, though. Most of the time lag/latency gives me little to no trouble.- I can't think of anything else to complain about.RRDDD is an astonishingly well-polished game given that it is the product of one developer. Erik has really hit on something genius here: gameplay that is immediately, viscerally, undeniably fun. Rarely do I play a game of RRDDD without someone commenting something along the lines of ""this game is so much fun."" It seems like an obvious thing -- most games are supposed to be ""fun"" -- but how often do people really feel the need to state it? Well, RRDDD is so much fun, that you will involuntarily cry out ""THIS GAME IS SO MUCH FUN"" every time you play it. There is nothing you can do to prevent it.In summary, the only valid reason to not want to play this game is that you hate fun. You don't...hate fun...do you?			"

								I love this game! When I bought it on the 82apps website I was excited to learn I'd be getting two Steam keys for it (one to keep, one to gift) so I was so glad to gift it to my best gaming buddy. Late the other night I told him I'd free up 5 minutes to give it a try real quick...an hour later I didn't want to stop playing!! I normally don't like games I can't use a controller with but with this game I keep my middle finger on the W and my pinky on the Shift (for extra speed). Still getting used to the controls but man this game is addicting! I hope to see lots of improvements in the future, like more music! 9/10 dodgeballs			"

								I had no clue what to think when I saw the name Robot Roller Derby Disco Dodgeball. At first I thought it was an expansion to Farming Simulator. But oh was I shocked, when the game booted up and my body lost control of its limbs and I started fist pumping like I Was at some heterosexual laser show in Queens. I totally have to say, this game is everything you would want. Sure it's not Rambo the game, but it has Robots, Dodgeball, crazy ♥♥♥ thump wub wub music, and did I mention Robots? It's a no brainer to have in your collection. Because you have to #BOLIEVE. Stop being a lemon, and be a rosebud, buy this game or you'll be haunted by the ghost of Don Knotts, who will constantly befuddle you with old quotes from the Andy Griffith show. Seriously, he was all hovering above my bed, going ""oooooooOOooooo Aunt Bea oooooOOoooo"" while rattling chains claiming we had to go put the town drunk in jail, only to let him out after he slept it off.

								Easily one of my favorite shooters on Steam. I've always loved quick paced skill based shooters, like Fistful of Frags and Double Action, as opposed to more tactical shooters, so this game is perfect for me. The game also features a great soundtrack, and eye catching visuals that look like they belong in a disco club, but fit perfectly with this game. The game is updated regularly, and each update is a pleasant suprise. At the moment, there's a pretty big variety of multiplayer modes (conventional modes like TDM and elimination, but also some unique modes like demolition derby and super ball) and there's a fair share of single player modes to try as well. It's a simple concept, but the game does a great job of keeping things interesting and keeping you addicted for hundreds of hours. It's easy to pick up and get into, but takes a very long time to master.I'd recommend this game to pretty much anyone looking for a quality skill based FPS. The community would love to welcome some new members.			"

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is a self described game. It is exactly as the title states. You play dodgeball as robots on wheels, all in a disco setting. What more do you really want?If you've played dodgeball when you were young, or perhaps playing it in gym class today, you'll be familiar with the rules. Take ball, throw at opponent, knock opponent out. If you catch an enemy ball the person who tossed it is out. Pretty simple but also really easy to get into and very fun. The game also mixes things up with tons of different maps and more play modes than I originally expected. Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball also features single play mode to keep you busy on lower population times.Indie multi-player games tend to have a hard time holding a consistent community, but Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball seem to almost always have a few players online at least. The only exception I saw was during the late late night on week days, which is understandable. But if you play during the day and you'll almost always find players. This is a great sign that the game is healthy, people are enjoying it, and has potential to grow.The great thing about Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is that it has enough twitch gameplay to keep many ""hardcore"" gamers satisfied, while simple enough that even the most casual player can get the hang of after a single round. It's very accessible yet offers a reasonable skill ceiling to climb.Though there is plenty to like about Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball, there are some hic-ups along the way. Bugs can plague the game, and they are quite noticeable. They vary from being as severe as floating off to no where, to as minor as having to hit ""esc"" to start moving. It is in early access and I understand this, but since the game is asking for your hard earned money, I think it's justified mentioning these things at the very least.Overall Robot Roller Derby Disco Dodgeball is a great little game that has some addictive qualities to it. It's accessible, it's twitchy, and it's a whole lot of fun! (Just make sure to swat those nasty bugs :P)Pros:- Accessible- Twitchy for the seasonal gamer- Well themed- Healthy communityCons:- Can be buggy at times			"

								If you're after a fun and authentic dodgeball experience (and you like dance music and party lights), look no further. Disco Dodgeball takes a simple idea and amps it up with sweet beats and colourful visual elements. Perfect as a party game to play with friends and equally fun alone, there are a bunch of game modes, neat power-ups and trickshots. I never thought I'd be as fond of this game as I've become, which to me is grounds for recommendation in itself. If I had to describe it in a word, it would definitely be FUN. Which sounds ambiguous, I know, but it's like every element of this game has been engineered to get you pumped up and excited to chuck balls at robots, which it totally does.I've watched this game grow and adapt for quite awhile now and it really has come a long way, especially visually. The developer really listens to the community's ideas and is always working to fix and improve the game, which really shows. For a beta, this game is extremely solid. The only real negative to comment on is the lack of players at this point in time, but I really hope that changes upon full release because this game really, really deserves a good fanbase.			"

												This is a fun and well-made dodgeball game.The most fun is multiplayer, and sometimes people aren't online, but most of the time you can find someone to play with. Or, if you've managed to have friends, that works too.There are singleplayer modes that are fun for a few hours maybe, but this is a multiplayer-focused game.Addicting and competitive gamemodes with powerups and cosmetics, definitely worth the low price.With the workshop you can submit items that you made to the game, with the potential to make money if it is accepted.Awesome dodgeball game.

												So my friend and I were debating on whether or not to buy this game. I mean, yeah it's only $8 but we were a little strapped at the time. It looked fun, though, which is why we were hesitant.My friend decided to bite the bullet--he is the one with the better job, after all. I had to go handle my dog, so I was gone for the moment he downloaded it, but I saw the result. It was like nothing I'd ever seen before in my life.He used to be a fairly heavyset guy with pimples all over his face and an awkward demeanor; not unlike myself, though more so I suppose. The man I walked into that day was different. I saw a 6'3'' bronzed warrior with perfect facial hair and a gleam in his eye that could make any lady drop at his feet. His phone immediately started going wild with notifications about the millions being depositied into his brand-new Cayman Island account. At that moment, I knew what I had to do.I powered up my crappy laptop, barely even meeting the specs, and told Steam to install this game.At once I could feel my crotch bulging as I grew three whole feet in as many seconds. The scruffy excuse I had for a beard was replaced with a layer of hair so glorious Zeus himself was jealous as I also grew six inches taller. I wasn't a large man before, but any semblance of being out of shape melted away from my frame like butter in an oven and my muscles gained glory I'd only dreamed of before. Even my dog, who'd only been a pug before, now stood proudly by my side as a German Shepard-Husky mix while a beautiful woman appeared in my arms, who is now my wife. Behind my friend, I saw the ghost of Genghis Khan nod in approval.We played for a little afterward for giggles. That was fun too.			"

												R.I.P. Game CommunityHad fun while it lasted. A unique idea that worked well but I guess people would rather play something else. It's competitive but casual with a retro and colorful atmosphere. I kicked a lot of a-s once I got used to the controls and game mechanics.http://steamcharts.com/app/270450It also has offline bots thankfully so it's not a complete waste of money. But right now that's virtually the only way to play unless you're lucky enough to have a dozen friends with this same game.Also, this game has the worst hit detection at times. A ball will collide with another ball but someone will somehow get knocked out. Many times I've seen a live ball hit a player and nothing happens. A ball will get within like 3 feet of a player and they'll get knocked out. There's many more examples but those are the most notable. The crafting system is rediculous. You get a new  item every day you play a match it seems. But you can't unlock anything with these. Just craft a complex ingredient once you finally get 5 different basic ingredients. Then once you craft 4 different complex pieces (which piece you get is random) you can finally unlock an uncommon item. It's beyond me why it takes so long to acquire one stupid cosmetic item from this system.			"

								What can I say?Firstly, it's ROBOT ROLLER DERBY DISCO DODGEBALL!If that doesn't hook you, then nothing will.First thing you notice when you open up the game is the music. The music is freaking amazing. It fits the game perfectly and you cant help but get lost in the trance-y electronic beats.Next is the visual style. Simple neon graphics. Fits the game perfectly. Not to mention robots with moustaches.The controls are perfect. Sensitivity can be adjusted and the movement is intuitive, although at first you may find yourself a little thrown off by the slidey nature of the robots. You find yourself effortlessly air striking opponent robots from 60m away or showing off with a 360 Helicopter dunk. (DUUUUUUNK!)The game features many gamemodes, the most commonly played of which are probably the Deathmatch, Free for All, Score Battle and Team Elimination. There are some modes that really mix it up like hoops, horde or super cube. Of course there are the occasional frustrating situations where you *swear* you had hit the guy but the kill didn't register. This isn't really a problem that can be circumvented EXCEPT for the fact that there is a 'switch host' function, so you can change the host to the person with the best ping to minimise lag!The community is really great and helpful and this is truly one of the best and funnest multiplayer experiences I have had in a long time. I hope to see the game grow and flourish as it progresses to completion.The developer, Erik, is a great guy and he listens to feedback/suggestions.A must get.9.5/10 "

								Throwing balls at your friends whilist frantically looking for the next ball and avoiding balls being thrown at YOU?! Sounds like a good time to me.This game is a load of fun, particularly with a room full of friends, or running into a group of people and having a good time, having jokes, and even the Dev. Erik plays a lot(whenever he isn't busy with the game or his own stuff) and it's great to be able to   play with him, such a great guy, definitely working hard at getting this game better and better.It's getting plenty of updates(not on a schedule, but still if there isn't an update Erik makes sure to be active on the forum and answer any questions. It has come a long long way from it's beginning, the stability has improved a lot, and the graphics(for all those that love all that eye candy) is great so far, and it isn't even finished yet!All and all, it's definitely worth sticking around for, you just gotta find out when the active people get on and aim for that window, it doesn't have a constant high number of players for the moment, but that should improve overtime, and heck it can't get bigger if 100 of you decide not to buy it because a small playerbase, thats 100 fewer players the game could have.So try it, and there should be some more optimization work on it(what can be done for unity, though sadly unity is just power hungry as a game engine it seems), so overtime it should hopefully run better on lower end systems.It is amazing to see what one guy has pretty much done himself though.It's also getting some SP challenges soon, so that's content for you to do if there aren't many people on when you feel like throwing some dodgeballs, and perhaps an arcade mode down the line(not confirmed), which I think would be great to have.Also the music is awesome, and really helps drive the gameplay.

								I have over 100 hours at the moment and I wouldn't take back 1. This game is everything you want in an early access. It has insanely fun multiplayer and the best community I've seen of any game on Steam. I ran some tournamants and everyone was nice and supportive. You are in various arenas and the object is to pick up dodgeballs and throw them at the other team. Simple. A nice twist on the fact you have to pick up the projectiles instead of having a gun. There are lots of gamemodes and Erik (the developer) is always adding new ones as well as maps. The only bad thing about this game is that more people don't play it :D. There are usually 2 or 3 people playing with 10 or so on weekends. BUY THIS GAME. YOU WILL BE SATISFIED.			"

												Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball... If you can say it, you're far ahead than most peopleSo, what is it?If you were to take popular FPS games like CS:GO, CoD, or Quake, throw them into a rave, then give them all slow-ish projectiles instead of guns, you would get this.The basic premise of RRDDD is dodgeball. (duh!) The main difference between real-life and Disco dodgeball is how there is no barrier to spereate teams. Yeah, you can turn around and get mashed in the face with a bright, glowing orb of terror. (I mean a dodgeball, not that guy from The Regular Show)Pros Very original concept. Show me one half-decent dodgeball game! Great music. This might be a matter of taste but I abso-freaking-lutley love the EDM that plays. That reminds me... You can add your own music. t might not be the most well known feature or even the best implemented but it's there and its real handy. Arcade mode is a blast, expecially when you have friends' scores to beat. Very simple online settings. I know that there are special tools to make fancy, dedicated servers but the in-game server list and ""make an online game"" tools are about all you'll ever need. Enough modifiers to crush a wooly mammoth. Want to play a low-gravity, game of FFA while one half can shoot lazer balls and the other have jet-packs? Now you can!Cons Laggy online. Like, don't even try catching the ball while moving backwards, just don't The bots are weird. They go from having the aim of a Stormtrooper to freaking Clint Eastwood depending on if they're ""Medium"" or ""Easy""  Non-existent servers. Good luck trying to find an online game.  It's actually gotten much bigger in recent times  Haven't seen the developer in a while. Gone are the times of the weekly or even monthly updates. The last update was like 3 months before this reveiw was written. (Comment if this changes and I'll rewrite it)  The reason for the slow updates was due to a massive local co-op update. The schedule has resumed.I can't recommend this game enough if you like fast-paced games or if you just have a few friends. Wait for the sales and try to pick up the 4-pack for like $20 if you can. (that's about 18 Euros and 14 British Pounds) I'm just dissapointed at the lag in the servers and the lack of players.TL;DR Good fast-paced game but  hardly anyone plays it  it's kinda laggy.EDIT: Fixed my horrible HTML. Anything strikethrough is new.			"

								The simplicity is what makes the game so awesome. It's a first-person shooter game of dodgeball in vibrant, flashy arenas with an amazing soundtrack to pump you up. Incredibly addictive (at least until after putting in about 40 hours of playtime)! The one downside I'd say is that you can't expect to be playing with a huge amount of people. On average each day, there are 20-30 people online, but it is early access so it makes sense. Even so, playing with bots is still really fun.I can't believe I forgot to mention this, but the developer, Erik, is always updating and is always talking with the community. Great guy.			"

TLDR belowRobot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball: a unique name for a unique game. I've played some good games, some bad games; I've played games for long periods of time, and I've played games for a few minutes before dropping them forever; and somehow, this game is a shining monument to what a game can be.The game itself is pure arena-FPS bliss, with the fun new twists a dodgeball theme would bring. You can choose to weave through a storm of murderous projectiles, or you can drop your own and bring demise to your foes by catching. Various game modes bring on entirely new styles of play: care is required to not die in elimination, while throwing caution to the wind to make a spectacular kill is totally acceptable in score battle. Powerups can turn the tide of battle if you use them correctly and can get you killed if you don't. The rolling movement is slightly difficult to acclimate to but definitely works to help the flow of the game. And of course, it wouldn't be an arena shooter if you didn't have an announcer stating your helicopter kills and your killstreak.However, the community and dev are what make the game truly outstanding. The community, albeit small, is full of great people willing to help you on your quest to dodgeball greatness or just chat. Bitter rivalries and strong friendships amongst veteran players make the game almost feel like a sport. Erik, our fabulous dev, keeps the updates coming many months after the game's release, through having a kid and working on a new project. He posted a post-mortem of the game a year after release, outlining the development process, the games strengths and drawbacks, and his plans for the future (link at bottom if you want to read it). Shortly after this, he dropped the games base price from 15 USD to 8 as part of an ongoing attempt to fix one of the game's major problems: the lack of players. He's constantly in the forums answering questions, looking for bugs to patch, and just trying to make everyone have a great experience.At this point I must implore you, reader who is considering this purchase: do the community, the dev, and most importantly, yourself a favor; buy this game. TLDR: great mechanics, great community, great dev, great purchase!Link to post-mortem: http://www.82apps.com/DiscoDodgeball/blog/disco-dodgeball-postmortem.htmlEdit: Totally forgot about robot customization. Robot customization and trading/market is good if you're into that sort of thing but is not necessary.			"

								WHY ARE YOU READING THIS? BUY THE DAMN GAME! Trust me, it's worth it. This game, even in its beta, is one of the most fun games ive played in a while. It's the first dodgeball game that ive found enjoyable. Theres A LOT more to do than just dodgeball however, there are race mods, a mode called Hoops that feels like a mix of soccer and basketball, and a few others that are pretty fun as well. bottom line is if you like having fun, this game is for you!

												I first saw Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball on the Steam store during Early Access. I was interested in this game because of the Disco Dodgeball part of the title, as I am a fan of the disco genre. I bought the game after it left Early Access. As I was introduced to this game, I was treated to a flashy arena filled with bright colors and entertaining disco music. This game has both single player and multiplayer, but it places more emphasis on multiplayer since it puts you, a rolling robot with one wheel, against other rolling robots. You are either with the red team or blue team. Your robot looks strikingly similar to Claptrap from the Borderlands series.Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball looks like a first-person shooter, but the weapon you use is a ball inside a futuristic looking arena with ramps, robots from your team, and robots from the opposing team. The game emphasizes combat with that ball and you can score one hit kills just like your opponents can do to you. There is never a dull moment in this game, as the music is always rocking and your robot is constantly running around the arena either trying to knock out your opposing robot or trying to avoid getting knocked out. It takes some time to master the skills of advanced movements such as blowing up a robot while in mid-air or blowing up a robot with a ricochet hit. So, this game is wildly different than traditional first-person shooters.The main mode is deathmatch, which requires your team to reach a particular score before your opponent does by scoring knockouts with your ball. There are powerups scattered around the arena that can give you an edge, such as a boomerang, higher jumps, extra ricochets, bigger balls for easier knockouts, easier targeting, etc. There are many other modes that enhance replay value with the main objective of scoring team points that have nothing to do with scoring knockouts. For example, hoops is a basketball-like mode that requires your team to find a specific ball to shoot through a hoop for a point and the team that shoots the most hoops wins. This mode puts your movement skills to the test because shooting hoops is extremely difficult while constantly moving. You will have to learn to use the brake key in order to shoot accurately. Another interesting mode is capture the cube, a mode that requires you to steal a cube from your opponent and race with the cube to place in your domain for a point. While the main goal is to score points with the cube, you can use your balls to knock out opponents to increase your personal level. Increasing your personal level will allow you to buy certain upgrades for future matches such as gears and other equipment. Other than teams, you can opt for free for all (FFA) competition in each mode. FFA requires all robots to compete for themselves, meaning you score for yourself and not for a team.Those who are used to first-person shooters will feel right at home because the mouse/keyboard configuration is familiar. The mouse is very effective in moving your futuristic robot in all directions. You can learn to catch balls thrown at you so that you can throw them back at your opponent for quick knockouts/kills. Mastering your movements can help you score creative kills which will increase your personal/robot level. Creative kills include the aforementioned killing in mid-air, ricochet kills, and long distance kills.One cool feature in this game is the ability to hit the F5 key to record the last four seconds of your gameplay. Recording the last 4 seconds of gameplay will be saved as a .gif file. You can place the .gif file in the artwork section of your Steam page to show off your sudden kills and talented moves. This type of recording is very rare for any video game.Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is an exciting game in terms of gaudy graphics and gameplay. I wish there were more music available, especially American disco. The music in the game sounds like European disco only, but it’s still very entertaining and will keep players upbeat. There are many levels of arenas with wildly different shapes and many modes that have different goals for scoring and winning matches.  I recommend this game for its looks, gameplay, and extremely high replay value. Kudos to Erik Asmussen for making a fine indie game.My score: 8/10 "

												Read full review here: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/TheZeronShow/discussions/3/133256240727983711/* Some facts about the game are subject to change, keep in mind the date the review was posted.Pros:- Interesting and unique design- Great diversity of game modes- Ability to set custom rules for the matches- Costumizable robots- Fair and balanced gameplay- Overall, a good community (thanks to the moderators)- Cheaters are rarely found and usually just affect highscores- The game is still getting updates- Many server locations- Easy to set up a server and the game provides many options for the host- Ability to play your own songs in the gameCons:- The light effects can confuse the player during gameplay- Latency issues that complicate core gameplay functions (ex: catching)- Despite the good diversity, some game modes are a chore to play- The way the spawn areas are set up, the teams will push each other just to grab a ball- The single-player portion of the game is decent, but not great- There aren't enough balls available in the matches, the player will spend too much time finding a ball rather than playing the gamePros/Cons (depending on the player):- The items don't have any effect in gameplay and are purely cosmetic- Fast-paced gameplay- Techno soundtrack- Obtaining higher levels and items becomes grindy at a certain point			"

												~~This review is outdated but with the latest updates I recomend this game more than ever~~My personal GOTY 2014. This game is a (somewhat) quake inspired dodge ball simulator with great music, flashing lights, and neon fueled robots. While there are quite a few gamemodes the three that stand out to me are normal (first to some amount of style points wins), elimination (standard dodgeball, you get hit you're out. If a teammate catches a ball someone comes back in), and deathmatch (first to some amount of kills). All that being said, servers are usually empty so you'll be playing against bots unless you have friends. The bots can hold their own though.			"

												Hectic and hilarious, with plenty to do in both singleplayer and multiplayer. In my opinion, the game has beautiful visuals and amazing soundtrack, without taking a serious toll on a rather mediocre graphics card.Game can be slightly rage-inducing (looking at you, Laserbot) and hit detection will make both the victim and the victor exclaim ""What the hell just happened!?"", but the game is otherwise flawless.To top it all off, you can customize your character! Granted, it's no massive Skyrim-level detail, but you can change your bot's color, mouth/moustache, and (unlockable) eyewear. As an added bonus, you can fool around with your victory and defeat portraits, rotating the eyes and moving the eyebrows around with different sliders.The game made a bright example of what Early Access and Pre-Alpha ought to be, and it promises to add more still!

								Robot Roller Derby Disco Dodgeball is the most inexpensive return to the arena shooter genre I've found on Steam...that's also available for Mac. The action's solid, the rendering is high-quality, and the music's good.  Although the movement mechanics can be frustrating, one might argue that they add another level of skill to the game (but this is for the player to decide).Do recommend for fans of old-school arena shooters (UT, Quake), although it recently stopped working on my computer for unknown reasons.

												love how this game takes normal dodgeball and turns it into almost any gamemode you could possibly imagine.  Online matches are sometimes hard to find but the bot match and challenge modes are very fun and can be challenging. Pros:1: customization is pretty straight foward and easy to get random decals2: variety of gamemodes3: all the matches I have played have been very enjoyable, meaning the community is great.Cons:1: some crafting materials drop way too much and some too little2: not that many games to join (not a consistent ammount)3: The bots can actually aim, and in some modes only go after youI totally recommend this game and some of the cons I have listed are realy just me complaining because this game is great!!!

												The most fun I've had playing an online multiplayer game in a long time. It's challenging without being frustrating, the announcer is full of laughs, and the game is wonderfully customizable from being able to change up your character to being able to play whatever music you'd like in game (let's be real - the equalizers in the arenas are cool as hell). My only problem with this game is that it's pretty dead. Grab a 4 pack and have an absolute blast with friends.10/10 "

												I don't really dig the tunes but you can mute that thump thump and turn on some ABBA for a delightfully violent robot pulvarizing ballet of leather and sparks. The game harkens back to a time when multi-online competition was about fun and not vulgar grinding. The game is packed to the brim with solo/friend modes. The scoring system for arcade isn't terribly intuative...but at least there is one. Buy the game. If nothing else as a slap in the face to COD and their groveling free weekend.			"

												Okay. First thing's first. I'm not going to say that this game is life-changing or breaks the boundaries between videogames and art, or that it is even an incredible game...but that's not a bad thing. Just because this game doesn't break any new ground or pose a philosophical question, doesn't make it a sh**ty game. Modern media has created this idea that for a game to be respected, it has to make people view the world in a new light. Well, guess what? This is Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball. It's a game about robots on roller skates, often with moustaches, zipping around a disco with flashing lights and electro music, throwing balls at eachother. It hasn't provoked any reaction in me to make me go; 'Dear God!!! My life has a new meaning!!!'. Instead, it made me say; 'Ohh I'm gonna kill this skate-riding robo-sunnuffab**ch' (this was actually a genuine reaction). I like this game. It's fun. It's quick. But the best part about this game's fun-ness, is the fact that it's stupid. Goat Simulator, is stupid. It's funny at first (the amount of time I found Goat Sim funny for can be measured in themtoseconds), but it's not fun. RR-DDD is impressive in the amount of pros it has, despite the strong overtones of stupidity. It's tight controls and fun visuals have given me some good times. It's a little pricey, and a price drop or a sale might be necessary before it's entirely worth investing your money in, but don't let the price stop you if you like an FPS which requires a decent level of tactical skill (I'm looking at you Call of Duty). If the price is too much for you personally, try it out with a friend who already owns it. It might not be your cup of tea. As I say, it requires some tactical practice which may not be something you want in your robot related disco-shooters. However, if you're not a fan of tactical strategy games and like some fast-paced fun, I recommend this game greatly, along with a few games like Awesomenauts (easier) or Ratz Instagib (much harder). In conclusion, I give this game an 8.5/10. It's cool, but is lacking in areas which I won't go into, because I really don't want to put you off. It's fun, and you should give it a go. Why the heck would you listen to me anyway? I'm a random dude off the internet.Finally, I don't think that this game is incredible or brilliant, but that's okay. You know why?Because it's a game about roller-skating robots in a f**king disco.			"

												Lightning fast paced game that is clearly best as a multiplayer arena fest. It's lightweight fare but close to being a must-buy at its tiny price point especially given that it frequently appears in bundles such as the excellent Indie Legends 5 on bundlestars. A pick up and drop game to fill short spaces of time, it has plenty of single player options and you can set up any number of bot matches if you don't have many friends that have it or just aren't that into competitive multiplayer.  It can also be greatly improved by several mods on the steam workshop. I'm not a fan of the music but that's just a personal, and minor, downpoint.			"

								This game is one of the most fun and unique first person shooters I've played. Instead of shooting bullets, you throw dodgeballs in a neon filled disco dodgeball match. The environment is stunning, and it reacts to the music currently being played on the game's soundtrack. Everything has a beautiful texture, particle effect or shine to it that makes this game feel and look great. I highly recommend that you get this game. It's worth every penny and you'll spend a lot of time playing it with your friends and the great community that already exists on this game!			"

								A friend bought a 4-pack and gifted me one. Holy Crow is this game fun! As you can see from the videos, the graphics won't knock your socks off, but in a game such as this graphics can and should take a back seat to playability. The playability of this game is FANTASTIC! Different game modes, game modifiers and an XP/leveling system. We played it for a couple of hours last night and I fell in love with it! One drawback at this time is the lack of players, which is fine because you can create a game with bots of whose playing level you can set yourself. As I suggestion I would like to see a minimap/radar included as an option on the HUD or in-game option as sometimes in larger maps it can be hard to find targets/opponents/objectives.			"

												This game far surpassed any expectations I had upon purchasing it. When I buy a game, I always consider if I'm going to play the game enough to make it worth it. Traditionally, I say to myself that if I play the game enough that it comes out to about $1/hour, It's worth it. $1/hour is very cheap entertainment. That being said, I bought the 4-pack for this game while it was on sale, since some of my friends wanted it, as well.  It is well worth the money. Even at it's current price of 15 bucks, it will easily entertain you far beyond its cost value. Next time it goes on sale, I'll be buying more copies and passing them out to all my Steam friends and maybe even using it to lure some more friends to the Dork Side.			"

												Writing a new review because this game has been updated a lot and is also currently on sale for 2 dollars. TL;DRThis game is insanely fun, and for 2 dollars (or even 10 dollars) you almost certainly will get your monies worth out of it. It has a few minor problems, but it's extremely well fleshed out and probably one of the best instagib shooters on the market right now. It's also an incredibly unique experience you won't find anywhere else, so I would have trouble not recommending it to anyone who even remotely enjoys FPS games. It has amazing physics/shooting, a fully fleshed out singleplayer and mutliplayer, local co-op (if you're into that), and a great community. It also has trickshots, who doesn't love trickshots?As you can probably see by my hours I like disco dodgeball. A lot. I got this game a long time ago when a youtube named ""AllShamNoWow"" made a video on it. The game was in very early stages of development, and was very bare bones in comparison to now. The game was fun but had many problems. It had a mechanic called ""blocking"" that sounded good on paper but ended up just being annoying. It had very little content, no good single player whatsoever and few maps. It had a lot of weird bugs and annoying physics problems. I can safely say that practically every issue and problem I had with the game is now gone however. The game overall just feels good, yeah it's graphics aren't great, but the gameplay itself is what matters to me and it does that wonderfully. If you see what the game is intended to be and like the concept, buy it. Because it does everything that it intended to do. Its single player is actually surprisingly in depth and fun, with a full fledged ""arcade"" mode with power-ups and bosses and waves of enemies. As well as many ""challenges"" including a hoard survival mode (challenges can also be played with up to 3 other players, which is nice). The game has many maps, around 15 I think at the moment. It has an insanely diverse cast of gamemodes, including my personal favorite ""hoops"" which consists of teams fighting over a golden ball and trying to score it into the opposing teams hoop to score points, so basically basketball where you can kill eachother. And many other fun modes as well as a large selection of ""advanced"" modes and modifiers which are basically just ways you can make the game even more ridiculous and crazy than it already is, which can be fun. Let's get down to the core of the game now. Shooting, physics, and other basic gameplay. Well I can say that it feels very unique and well done. The shooting has an element of satisfaction that I haven't seen from any other insta-gib shooter, which I think mostly comes down to how conservative you must be with your shots and the management of picking up dodgeballs. There's usually only around 10-16 dodgeballs in a map, so you have to make your shots count because without one you are practically defenseless (you can catch balls thrown at you, but it's quite difficult). The physics, like ball physics or movement, also feel very unique and good. Unlike most shooters the player is actually a physical object, so things like going off ramps or bouncing into walls actually affects how you move. This adds an incredible level of depth to the game, things like strafing become more difficult because you can't instantly switch directions like in games like cs:go. The balls being physical objects also allow you to pull creative trickshots like bouncing balls off walls (Also did I mention you get extra points for performing trick shots? Because you do. And it's awesome). There's many other things I love about this game, but I don't want this to be a massive wall of text. Here's a few other noteworthy things however.-The community, it's really good and extremely friendly. Far more than any other online game I've ever seen, especially a shooter. I'm a moderator for the game and I've almost never used my mod powers to punish anyone, because I've never needed to. -The customization/modability, this game has not only an incredible amount of cosmetic customization, but it also has the option to create custom gamemodes, or add your own music/voicepacks to the game (the music also reacts to the in game visualizers!). The gamemodes are especially cool, because it allows you to create hilarious or unique experiences that you otherwise wouldn't have been able to do. Cons to the game:For me personally, not many. The most noteworthy one I can think of however is the ""netcode"" as people might call it. Unfortunately this is unavoidable and will happen in any instagib, but things like kill trading or getting hit by a ball when you think you shouldn't have will happen. They are rather uncommon, but they are there sometimes. And that can be a huge turn off for some people. The game also has in the past had a small community, currently it's quite healthy, hitting about 200 players peak per day, but it could drop again, who knows. Let me know if you have any questions about the game, I'm sure I missed a lot. I know a tun about it so I should be able to answer anything you might have.			"

Traditionally, I say to myself that if I play the game enough that it comes out to about $1/hour, It's worth it. $1/hour is very cheap entertainment. That being said, I bought the 4-pack for this game while it was on sale, since some of my friends wanted it, as well.  It is well worth the money. Even at it's current price of 15 bucks, it will easily entertain you far beyond its cost value. Next time it goes on sale, I'll be buying more copies and passing them out to all my Steam friends and maybe even using it to lure some more friends to the Dork Side.			"

												I want YOU to play this game!Super addicting fast paced fun multiplayer game but for some reason NO ONE IS PLAYING IT. Rocket League players, I can almost guarantee you will like this game. Not as deep as RL but you still can sink many hours into this. There are an impressive array of game modes and maps. You can tell the Devs want to think outside tthe box of normal ""Deathmath/Teams/CTF"" game modes. I find myself playing a lot of different modes regularly, unlike in other games where I usually just find 1 or 2 favorite game types and stick to them.The EDM/Tron aesthetic is  very in-your-face, I personally found it to be cool, but if that turns you off, be warned its pretty intense. The only issue is that there needs to be more songs in rotation. I think if more people played the game they may update the music more regularly.			"

								Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is deceptively simple and amazingly fun to play.Positive:-Fun-Great music-Fast paced, I would compare it to the likes of Quake 2 with dodgeballs.Negative:-Netcode has some problems as of this writing. Balls will appear in your hand but then disappear, players will occasionally be hit by a ball that doesn't register the hit or appears to not connect.Overall, I highly recommend this game. It's a blast to play with friends! The Arma 3 milsim group that I'm apart of likes to wind down from our weekly ops with the game (http://www.dog-company.com).			"

								Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is a challenging, entertaining and beautiful multiplayer FPS. Reminiscent of old-school arena shooters, Disco Dodgeball offers a rich and compelling multiplayer experience. It features a diverse list of game modes and power ups that make every match an adrenaline-inducing ride. Soaked in neon paint and powered by electronic dance music, the arenas react to you, the match and the soundtrack. Although still in early access, the game receives regular updates that improve on core systems and listen to feedback from the community. Definitely recommend.			"

								This game is great, it's fun and doesn't require load of time. It's a game you can just pick up, go a few rounds, and go do something else. (this works really well for me because I get weird when it comes to starting a game that is guaranteed to keep me occupied for a large amount of time)To repost the phrase that's been used for many things to varying degrees of truth: it's easy to pick up and difficult to master. You can play with no experience whatsoever, but that's not to say you don't get better with experince. A good player on a good day can seem unstoppable, but at the same time a new player never feels useless.Also it's robots throwing glowing dodgeballs at eachother. Explosions everywhere and killer music. It's amazing.			"

I would recommend this Game to everyone. It's fun, easy, has a good soundtrack (if you like Disco at least), and it includes many different gamemodes.The Maps aren't to big, but different. Also the Gameplay never feels unfair. The only bad point i can think of is that there aren't Official Servers, but to be fair: This Game has always about 50 Players online,  why even make one? Also, the Developer reacts fast to Questions (he helped me after about 10 Minutes) and seems like a cool guy.So:  Buy this Game!  "

								This game is one of the most fun and unique first person shooters I've played. Instead of shooting bullets, you throw dodgeballs in a neon filled disco dodgeball match. The environment is stunning, and it reacts to the music currently being played on the game's soundtrack. Everything has a beautiful texture, particle effect or shine to it that makes this game feel and look great. I highly recommend that you get this game.

								There aren't enough words to describe how great this game it. It's such a great online game, and the fact that it's based around using dodgeballs allows for it to feel incredibly unique. Since you're only allowed to carry one at a time, it becomes really exhilarating when you see a cluster of enemies, and have to decide whether you want to go for the easy kill when as soon as you release the ball, you KNOW you'll have to scramble for another one or do your best to evade whatever they can throw at you. The balls also move with momentum and a speed that seems highly appropriate, which works great with the way the robots control. On top of just excellent feeling gameplay, you also have about 6 different game types, all which manage to feel unique, along with a training mode that allows you to get a feel for any of the environments you choose, and a single player horde mode. Speaking of single player, while there is no campaign or anything, the addition of playing offline with bots is a definite advantage, along with the ability to fill empty spots in online games with them as well to balance out the teams. In most games, bots tend to be completely useless, but there have been several games i've played with 6/8 human players where a bot manages to finish in the top three without the game feeling overwhelmingly cheap.Easily a recommended purchase in my book, especially for the price and amount of polish at such an early point in it's release. The soundtrack alone is probably worth this much, if not more. Hopefully I'll see some of you online!			"

												This is easily my favorite game of 2015. I bought it back in February after seeing the trailer and have been hooked on it ever since. I used to be heavily into FPS games since the late 90s but have in the last 5 years or so stopped playing M-rated or other gorey\violent games for personal reasons. I was never a tournament champ or anything, but I was decent enough after playing for so long, so it has been difficult to find other games to excersize my reaction time and twitch reflexes with a mouse and keyboard.Enter RRDD. What a game!Where do I start?Its accessible due to the huge number of game modes, surprisingly good Bot AI and basic rules, but it is also highly rewarding for those that stick with it and try to compete with the long time players.The community is helpful, full of good sports, and for the most part dedicated to the game. I don't have anywhere near as much time to dedicate to games as I used to (which is a good thing) but RRDD has gotten the lions share of my game time to help keep the servers active... and because its just so stinking entertaining!The graphics are simple compared to the latest realistic looking AAA games, but they're excellent for a game like this. I do find myself turning a couple settings off simply to get better visibility and less distraction, but the game still looks crisp, clean and attractive. Performance also scales really well. I much prefer gaming on my desktop but if I really want to I can play it acceptably on my laptop with integrated HD4000 graphics at 720P while maintaining a reasonably high frame rate with some settings reduced.There aren't a ton of different sound effects in this game, but the ones that are there are distinct and serve the purpose perfectly. Explosions are thoroughly satisfying, and the announcer is very well done, as you'd expect from the trailer. The music is a big highlight of the game and I will admit, I like the soundtrack and it still doesn't bug me after nearly 65 hours of gameplay. You can add your own music as well, if you convert it to OGG format.Single player modes and bot matches are extremely satisfying, but multiplayer is where the game truly shines. Thankfully, because of the developer's forethought, bot matches and multiplayer matches blend together in a way that keeps people playing on a server with bots long enough for other players to join. Most games struggle with the early days of developing a player base because everyone checks the server list, sees no one playing, and quits the game. With RRDD, if there aren't any servers currently, you can make a bot server rather than start an offline game, and often times you'll have another player join within minutes (replacing a bot), and you may have a full server within half an hour. Almost all game modes can be started as multiplayer servers, so it is recommended to always do this to help keep people playing multiplayer.The game's multiplayer is very smooth, though players with high ping (especially if they are server hosts) will almost always cause unpredictable behavior. With RRDD, it IS anoying when things change in front of you or you get messed up due to a difference in ball-physics calculations between clients... but it just kind of comes with the territory. Read the guides on the forums to get an understanding of how it works and why you'll often see minor glitches... but don't let it deter you. I'm usually pretty picky about things like this, but RRDD is so much fun that its totally worth having a few weird things happen in each game. When you think about the insane reaction times and how many interactions are happening per second, frankly it blows my mind that the game works as well as it does. We're not talking about clicking on someone and having them fall over from 100 yards away. We're dealing with physical objects flying through the air realistically and colliding with players, other balls, walls, etc. ... and MAN does it all happen fast. If you think you're fast and you love twitchy games, you have to play RRDD. I think I finally found a game to make use of high-DPI gaming mice. I've never used such high DPI and sensitivity settings before this game, but I've found that it is highly beneficial if you plan on being able to track a ball flying over your head, click ON it to catch it (as its flying), and then chuck it accurately before the next one comes flying in.Additonal awesome things about the game:*Ever-evolving and well supported by a fantastic developer that is on the forums constantly and actually listens to and implements player suggestions.*Extensive leaderboards that make competition rewarding.*New game modes added since release, and they are fantastic!*Recent news of an upcoming update that will allow CUSTOM game modes.

												Okay, so I saw this game on the Winter sale and it got my attention and curiousity. After I played the game for a couple of hours I understood that it's actually EVEN BETTER than what I expected. It's extremely fun and relaxing after a long hard day. The mechanics, the soundtrack that will keep you in the game and will give you a hell of a good time, the different maps and game modes, the cool achievements and items you can customise your character with (if you're into this kind of things) and not to forget the cool Steam badges the developers of this game offer, it's all absolutely fantastic. If you want hours of absolute fun accompanied by a lovely soundtrack (you can also import your own music if you want to) then buy this game. Even on it's full price it's absolutely worth it. So get this game for yourself, sit back and have a great time.			"

								Robot Roller-Derby Disco dodgeball is one of few FPS games that I thoroughly enjoy. It's similar to Quake, but with neon lights, dodgeball, robots, dubstep, and a small fanbase that deserves more people. Despite being an early access game, the game feels complete and I reccomend it 110% if you're a fan of the sort of arena FPS in which you need to pick up projectiles. With ~an hour 15 minutes left in the sale, you should most definitely look in to this game.			"

												This game is awesome fun.   A very different FPS game, but very well made.  You shoot dodgeballs at your opponents.  Lots of modes to play too!   You can start your own server and play with bots until people show up.   But the bots are fun too.  Or you can also play single player - which is good practice.   The announcer is wicked great.   I am not very good at this game because I am so used to the movement in other FPS games (ie QuakeLive), but I can still get my frags.   The disco maps are hilarious.  The only thing I do not understand is the 'shield' (spawn protection) when opponents first regenerate.   I wish there was a way to tell when they are protected from being fragged.   So many times I fired a dodgeball at an opponent - only to see on my screen that they were spawn protected.  I THINK it is for 3 seconds, but there is no way to tell - as far as I know.  But this game is very fun (and very different FPS).			"

3.5 out of 5With robot Luigis!There's a certain slickness to RRDDD, or what must be the freshest multiplayer game to come out in sometime. Starting out with a basic concept of dodgeball, RRDDD turns it on its head to the point of insanity.Boss fights, jetpack fuelled battles, homing dodgeballs, funktastic tunes, fugitive mode, robots with moustaches!! The game is also very fast, very easy to learn and yet very satisfying as well. So if the game continues to add content it may well become the greatest multiplayer game on steam - which according to the (current) user reviews it already is.			"

												Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is a fast paced instagib first person shooter, filled to the brim with flashy lights, disco awesomeness, robots on rollers playing dodgeball. That wasn't enough to make you buy this game? PROSMechanics are really simple. Move over or click dodgeballs to pick them up.  Press shift to go faster. Press space to jump. Click to throw dodgeballs. Hold down to throw further and faster.  Click incoming dodgeballs to catch them. That is literally it. Easy to learn.Fast paced first person shooting. There is almost always a engagement around the corner to get stuck into. Rewarding first person shooting. You'll feel awesome after landing a 360 noscope while flying through the air while on a 12 killstreak.Friendly community. There will be that guy though.Hard to get angry over. As a angry person, the frags are fast enough to not get mad over, unless it's a BS wall reflect, no one likes those :PGood gamemodes. From the standard Capture the Cube and Team Deathmatch modes, there is also the Superball and even a Basketball mode.Good Bots to play against.A wide amount of powerups! FREAKING DISCO DODGEBALLING ROLLING ROBOTS.Cons.Small userbase. This is the biggest killer- a multiplayer game with no people to play it is not a multiplayer game. Do your part and help fill up the community. Not many maps. This will be adressed soon, with a custom map editor, but I tend to stick to 3 or 4 maps. Plus, there are only 9 or so maps. Some internet issues, nothing major.RATING.9/10Solely held back by it's lack of a community, despite the fact it's better than 9/10 other modern shooters which claim to be next gen. "

								There aren't enough words to describe how great this game it. It's such a great online game, and the fact that it's based around using dodgeballs allows for it to feel incredibly unique. Since you're only allowed to carry one at a time, it becomes really exhilarating when you see a cluster of enemies, and have to decide whether you want to go for the easy kill when as soon as you release the ball, you KNOW you'll have to scramble for another one or do your best to evade whatever they can throw at you. The balls also move with momentum and a speed that seems highly appropriate, which works great with the way the robots control. On top of just excellent feeling gameplay, you also have about 6 different game types, all which manage to feel unique, along with a training mode that allows you to get a feel for any of the environments you choose, and a single player horde mode. Speaking of single player, while there is no campaign or anything, the addition of playing offline with bots is a definite advantage, along with the ability to fill empty spots in online games with them as well to balance out the teams. In most games, bots tend to be completely useless, but there have been several games i've played with 6/8 human players where a bot manages to finish in the top three without the game feeling overwhelmingly cheap.Easily a recommended purchase in my book, especially for the price and amount of polish at such an early point in it's release. The soundtrack alone is probably worth this much, if not more. Hopefully I'll see some of you online!			"

								Robot Roller-Derby Disco dodgeball is one of few FPS games that I thoroughly enjoy. It's similar to Quake, but with neon lights, dodgeball, robots, dubstep, and a small fanbase that deserves more people. Despite being an early access game, the game feels complete and I reccomend it 110% if you're a fan of the sort of arena FPS in which you need to pick up projectiles. With ~an hour 15 minutes left in the sale, you should most definitely look in to this game.			"

I also like that it has splitscreen, which not alot of games have these days, so it's a good game to play with friends.

												Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is a fast paced instagib first person shooter, filled to the brim with flashy lights, disco awesomeness, robots on rollers playing dodgeball. That wasn't enough to make you buy this game? PROSMechanics are really simple. Move over or click dodgeballs to pick them up.  Press shift to go faster. Press space to jump. Click to throw dodgeballs. Hold down to throw further and faster.  Click incoming dodgeballs to catch them. That is literally it. Easy to learn.Fast paced first person shooting. There is almost always a engagement around the corner to get stuck into. Rewarding first person shooting. You'll feel awesome after landing a 360 noscope while flying through the air while on a 12 killstreak.Friendly community. There will be that guy though.Hard to get angry over. As a angry person, the frags are fast enough to not get mad over, unless it's a BS wall reflect, no one likes those :PGood gamemodes. From the standard Capture the Cube and Team Deathmatch modes, there is also the Superball and even a Basketball mode.Good Bots to play against.A wide amount of powerups! FREAKING DISCO DODGEBALLING ROLLING ROBOTS.Cons.Small userbase. This is the biggest killer- a multiplayer game with no people to play it is not a multiplayer game. Do your part and help fill up the community. Not many maps. This will be adressed soon, with a custom map editor, but I tend to stick to 3 or 4 maps. Plus, there are only 9 or so maps. Some internet issues, nothing major.RATING.9/10Solely held back by it's lack of a community, despite the fact it's better than 9/10 other modern shooters which claim to be next gen. "

												This game is awesome fun.   A very different FPS game, but very well made.  You shoot dodgeballs at your opponents.  Lots of modes to play too!   You can start your own server and play with bots until people show up.   But the bots are fun too.  Or you can also play single player - which is good practice.   The announcer is wicked great.   I am not very good at this game because I am so used to the movement in other FPS games (ie QuakeLive), but I can still get my frags.   The disco maps are hilarious.  The only thing I do not understand is the 'shield' (spawn protection) when opponents first regenerate.   I wish there was a way to tell when they are protected from being fragged.   So many times I fired a dodgeball at an opponent - only to see on my screen that they were spawn protected.  I THINK it is for 3 seconds, but there is no way to tell - as far as I know.  But this game is very fun (and very different FPS).			"

3.5 out of 5With robot Luigis!There's a certain slickness to RRDDD, or what must be the freshest multiplayer game to come out in sometime. Starting out with a basic concept of dodgeball, RRDDD turns it on its head to the point of insanity.Boss fights, jetpack fuelled battles, homing dodgeballs, funktastic tunes, fugitive mode, robots with moustaches!! The game is also very fast, very easy to learn and yet very satisfying as well. So if the game continues to add content it may well become the greatest multiplayer game on steam - which according to the (current) user reviews it already is.			"

								Oh my god, this game... I don't know where to start.- The soundtrack is absolutely amazing. It's my second favorite of all of the games I've ever played (and trust me, I've played a lot of games in my lifetime).- The gamemodes provide variety and different challenges and spins, and keep it from being boring.- You get to hit your friends in the face... with dodgeballs. On top of that, they get to stare at your creepy mustache while the announcer says some kind of taunt like ""YOUR MOTHER IS A TOASTER.""The only negative, in my opinion, is that the bots/AI are/is just a little annoying - but I'm looking forward to future updates to help fix this. If you're looking to get this game, definitely spend the $10. It's completely worth it!			"

								I don't ordinarily recommend games that are quite so early in development, but I'll make an exception for Robot Roller Derby Disco Dodgeball. This game is absolutely fantastic- it's as fun to play as it is to say. Remember Quake? Well, it feels a lot like Quake, but with robots. In a disco.It's very fast-paced, the community is pretty friendly and there are several great modes in the game. It's clear that a lot of imagination has gone into this game, and I absolutely recommend picking it up.			"

												This is a perfect example of a game that is easy to pick up and extremely difficult to master.The easiest way to describe it is as a physics-based FPS with THPS-style tricks: You're a robot on wheels. It's dodgeball, only with scores of interesting modes. You can perform silly but incredibly satisfying moves for extra points — like helicopters (turn 360° mid-air) and godlikes (catch an opponent's ball mid-air and hit someone else with it before you land). Perform them in Score Battle mode to win faster. Perform them in regular deathmatch mode for kudos or just to show off.The one downside with the game is that the online community, while dedicated, is very small. However, I still give it my fullest recommendation because of the decent AI, which is incredibly entertaining to play against.			"

								If you like skill-based shooters or disco music I can highly recommend this game to you. I've discovered RRDDD way before it was on Steam via Nerd³'s video on it, and I can say it has come a long way since then. Reasons to buy this:Amazing visual and audio effects (the announcer is aweome)Many different game modes (e. g. Classic Deathmatch, Last Team Standing ""Elimination"", Capture the Cube, Hoops - and even possible in Free For All)Power-ups like super-jump, jetpack, huge balls (hey, I didn't name them, ok?), homing dodgeballs etc.Groovy soundtrackRegular updates by one-man team Erik (!) ... and so much fun pretty much like in no other game. It's by far the most-played game I have on Steam.There might be some lags (~150 ping from Europe to the US East Coast server), but this issue got resolved by implementing region servers a few updates ago. So, what are you waiting for? Time to flood the servers! Show your skills ... or your luck (or both!).(If you are unsure about robots fighting in a disco arena try out the demo!)Also, did I mention you can customize your bot by putting on glasses and beards? Because why not.			"

												this game is so much fun, its crazy how the creators were able to create something to advanced with such a simple conecpt. a leveling system, items, trick shots, gamemodes, maps. and as far as I know the game functions so easily it actually is balanced in high ping vs low ping players. You can add your own music to play some dodgebll to. you can call in an airstrike apparently if you get a kill on somebody below you. check out my youtbue channel where i'll be posting a gameplay video of this game to show you how intense and fun this game can actually be.https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgXLHuoPoL2RoYObJlzrHUw "

												A unique take on arena shooters RRDDD is a game that adds a momentum mechanic where once you buld up speed you need to slow down, turn at an angle or brake to halt yourself completely, which means you are more likely to be punished by positional errors.  The game aesthetically has a lot going on as you can imagine but it also offers a quite in depth option menu despite coming out of early acces only recently of this post so you can tune the visuals as you see fit.The dodgeballs are one hit kill but can be caught(which can be quite difficult) and you have the option of whether you want to play with power-ups or not, which can vary from uncatchable balls to increasing the hitbox size. The game offers  unique game modes along side those you typically find, these include hoops where a basketball element is thrown in, grand prix which adds a racing element and high score; where your score when eleminating someone is dictated by how stylish your shot was. Pros-Great LAN game, can always pick it up and have a fun hour or two with friends-Diverse game modes-Suprisingly expansive options menu-Can import your own music and have the lights/lasers adapt to it!-New mechanical elements-Doesn't take up much hard drive spaceCons- Some of the settings may cause certain people headaches- Mostly multi-player centric (Has single player but it's strengths lie in multiplayer)			"

												This game is exactly what it says it is! That is, a trippy, fast-paced, sci-fi sports game where funky robots throw balls at each other to earn kills. Sounds simple, right? Honestly, it sounds like it might be too simple, or even boring, but trust me - it's not.Ah, yes. This game reminds me of the days when games were built for fun, when small studios would simply think of a good idea and run with it, without worrying about whether or not it fit the current market trends. This game is surprisingly original as a result; I can't think of any other game like it. It scratches an itch that most other games simply don't.I was pleasantly surprised by how robust this game is. The map designs are highly varied, there are tons of powerups to grant your robot different abilities (flaming balls, homing balls, giant balls, and boomerang balls, to name a few), your robot will ""level up"" and unlock new cosmetics, there is a crafting system, and there are a plethora of different game modes which serve to keep you adapting to new styles of play. There's just so much here to keep a person entertained, but for some reason, none of this came across to me when I watched the trailers. Truly, this is a game that you have to play for yourself in order to understand how awesome it is.To try and describe it though, this game is all about skill, and learning how to react quickly and precisely is the key to victory. The matches are fast and furious, but at times feel like a ballet - occasionally your robot will drift, skid, or soar through the air, and you will quickly find that it takes some careful tactics in order to avoid becoming exposed and killed. You will also find, occasionally, that you will be in the ""zone"" and, as if in a trance, start to rack up massive amounts of kills while jamming to the beat of the killer soundtrack.Speaking of which, this game has some of the best music I've heard in recent memory (finally, I've found a game where I don't have to turn the music off and listen to my MP3s!) If you like electronic music at all, I can promise you that you will fall in love with the soundtrack immediately. To make things even better, the psychedelic arenas visually react to the music and change colour when the songs turn over, which only serves to enhance the whole experience. ""Stimulating"" is the word I would use to describe this fusion of sights and sound, and it is a stroke of pure brilliance on the developers' parts.I really can't think of enough good things to say about this game, but with that said, there are a few downsides that I feel I should mention:Firstly, the community seems to be very small, and this can lead to a deficit of viable servers or servers that are crowded with bots. It's easy enough to use the server browser to find out where all the human players are at, but if you elect to use the ""quick match"" feature, be prepared to be thrown into the ring with bots every time.Secondly, if your ping is higher than 100, you will quickly find that you are at a marked disadvantage against people who have, say, 30-50 ping. Joining the right server is crucial for this reason, but it's a bit disappointing that the netcode doesn't do anything to compensate for this.Thirdly, you will encounter the occasional hacker. It seems that the community is largely hacker-free, but this unfortunate element does seem to exist to some degree. Thankfully, the game has a votekick feature so that troublemakers can be dealt with swiftly.Lastly, I feel like the game needs a teensy, tiny bit of polish. The UI and menus are a bit ugly, and while the arenas do look great, there are some rough visual edges on a few of the maps. These are small gripes, but they are gripes nonetheless.Minor issues aside, I am already hooked on Robot Roller Derby Disco Dodgeball despite having played very little of it. This game ""grabbed"" me right away and refuses to let go, and that is an impressive feat to be said for any game. I am planning to play a lot more of it, and I hope you will take the plunge and do the same!			"

								This game is pretty damn awesome. Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball has an amazing soundtrack. Not only does it fit what is going on in the game, it really pumps you up and gets you ready to crush nooblords in the ring of dodgeball. The controls are excellent when you get a hang of them, and you can really get sweet kills when you combine your jump and boost correctly.This game also feels incredibly rewarding. Getting a kill feels awesome. Catching a ball feels awesome. Catching a ball and then getting a guy behind the person who threw the ball at you is awesome. Getting killed and then getting a mid-air kill on the person who killed you feels amazing. I've experienced this in bots alone.This game is tons of fun. But the community is very small at the moment. This isn't really a bad thing though. You will recognise a lot of people if you play on public servers often. I haven't met a single person that has a negative attitude. But, sometimes you cannot find a server with people in it and have to play with bots.The bots in this game aren't the average bots. The easy bots can be a challenge even after you play this game for a while. The bots are getting worked on often, and this has gave us the result of challenging bots. The bots actually use teamwork, like passing the ball to you or someone in need, or protecting somebody that is completing and objective in some game modes like Capture the Cube.  There are also a lot of game modes, with more going to be released. One of the ones I like is Score Battle. In this game mode you have to rack up a certain number of points for your team (or yourself if it's free-for-all) by getting points for killing other players. You get more points for doing crazier skill shots, such as a Helicopter, or a Dunk.This game is just good. Real good. Before I said don't buy it until the community grows. Now I say support this game and Developer (https://twitter.com/82apps). They both deserve the support. This game is incredibly fun, and will only get better. As of now, I only have 3 hours played. This will definetely increase. Buy it, love it, and then finally remember it's full name.EDIT: Updating at the release of the Arcade mode. This game has done nothing but get better and better. Buy it now before it's price gets increased. If your friends get in on this game with you, it's INCREDIBLY fun. Powerups, maps, modes, and more have been added and I love it.			"

After playing the simple and short tutorial and then playing my first few bot matches, I got hooked.-The game has an AMAZING soundtrack, but it can get repetitive at times.-Very colorful, I like that-Fun gameplay, nice and smooth-Easy controls-Single player and online are two good options to play at-Bad spawns (you can get killed almost right off the bat)Overall, this game is worth to at least try out. I can imagine future updates that highly improve this game and unleash it's awesome potential. Get it while it's on sale. I would rate this game 8/10. PS. I HATE the Jetpacks. >.> "

												This game is fantastic.It is a trippy FPS style game where you play a robot on a single wheel (so the movement is purposefully floaty) and you play dodgeball in a crazy discotech with awesome music and cool light effects.  There is few community, mainly because I don't think people really remember to play this game, not because its boring or bad.  I have a blast whenever I play, or until I ragequit from arcade mode. =PAnyways, pick it up on a sale to give it a try, or better yet, grab a four pack so we can get some more people in there to play this fun game!

												This is an excellent game to play wityh friends. It brings you right back to highscool dodgeball playing agains sweaty opponents that starts to cry as soon as they get a ball in their face. The gamemodes are varied and fun and the techo-music is great with throwback to the 90's. All in all a very enjoyable game if you got friends to play with. I hope the amout of people on the servers pick up. The recent Humble Bundle deal might help with that. 9/10.			"

Burn baby burn! DISCO INFERNO! Burn baby burn!Yes. Game may have really small community and game network isn't always stable, but I simply cannot give this game a bad recommendation. It's premise, presentation and execution is extremely tight, creating one of the most fun multiplayer experiences you can find. It's really what it says on the tin: robots playing dodgeballl to the awesome retro-chiptune-disco soundtrack and it's so much fun tossing projecticles into others' faces in pleaphora of ways.Grab your friends, buy a 4-pack and have fun. Dev and his game really deserve more love, judging by their commitment with updates and efforts to keep making the game better. It's a really fun and innocent game and those do not come frequently.

								Awesome easy to pick up game. This game combines elements from old games arena that don't suck like Goldeneye and Mario Kart. It's a relief to see some color in an FPS and not have someone named Ramirez shouting in your ear. It is highly addictive and would recommend this game to anyone.

												Praise lord Gaben as he has let this game on steam.This game is just MMM, its just MMM, MMM I say MMM!Just to give you a taste of this game I'll list some pros.Pros:Great soundtrackGreat modelsSmooth even on old ComputersVery ColorfulGreat time wasterFast pacedTONS of customizationPlenty of modesTons of achievements for a simple game!Multiplayer AND singleplayer (Both have team modes)of course there are still cons, It's not a game if its perfect.If there was something as a perfect video game I'd probably say it was a dream.Cons:Hard at firstNot able to stop instantly (Well... You are a robot)Can be TOO colorful. (Don't play if you have epilepsy)It's really sensitive and you might say thats good but even at 20 sensitiveity it is STILL senitive.Some pretty good players and a little hard for starters.Not big communityHard to get exactly what you want on multiplayer without making a serverYou should definitely get this game! For all the content it has it is an EXTREMELY good deal, and it has both singleplayer and multiplayer capabilities. This game also has a level up system but you can level up in both singleplayer and multiplayer. Beware though if you get too good at this game you will be called a hacker (Like me) Byt I dont beleive anyone has been banned from this game. But I honestly do beleive you should get this game. You will get TONS of time out of it. and I'm STILL gonna play it even after 5.9 hours. Thats just this week! This game is very addicting and I belive you should get this game.			"

												There's a damn good reason why this is (currently) the highest rated multiplayer game on steam - It's a ton of fun! At the £10/$15 it's well worth the money and there's a surprising amount of depth to it with all the different gamemodes/customisation available. The soundtrack is amazing, the aesthetic works really well (not distracting at all) and the netcode works pretty much flawlessly. Oh and you can also give your robot a custom mustache, so what's not to love?			"

												When you get past all of the chatter about the potential of this game looking better on a PC, and all of the yip-yap about Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball being ""just another"" first person shooter, and all of the lip-flapping about this game not being able to compete with the very best games on PS2 or GameCube and you actually sit down and play the game on your Xbox...you're in for one hell of a game.The only thing people need to be concerned about when it comes to this game is how soon they're going to get it and where they're going to find the time to play. With a story good enough for a full length novel, audio and visual elements as detailed as any you've ever seen and excellent pacing, This game is the reason for Xbox and vice versa. Bungie has brought to the Xbox the game that will prove hundreds of thousands of naysayers wrong (about the system and thegame) and bring sweet relief and joy to those who've been biting their nails and pacing in circles waiting for Microsoft's machine to arrive. Hype is one thing; reality is another; Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball on Xbox is one of the best things to happen in videogames.Features:Situational First and Third Person perspectives.Role-based, cooperative multiplayer team gamePlay story mode as a single player or cooperatively with another player.Choose from a variety of conventional human and powerful alien weaponryVehicles include marine jeeps and tanks to alien flyers and hovercrafts.Squad based combat.Enjoy the action with 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound and Widescreen playback features.The StoryRobot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball takes place in the far future where mankind is locked into a brutal war against a race of aliens known as the Covenant. These dudes are seriously evil. They wipe out entire planets at a time, and they are so fast at doing so that we poor humans are unable to get much information on them before they nuke us into oblivion.The horde of aliens is getting closer and closer to Earth with the clock quickly ticking down before they completely annihilate our race. Finally the line is drawn. In a massive battle near a human planet, only one ship survives: Pillar of Autumn. The commander of the ship decides to lure the Covenant as far away from Earth as possible so she programs the ship's AI to jump to some random location in the opposite direction of the home system.Eventually the ship arrives at a distant area or space where they find both a gas giant called Threshold and its small moon known as Basis. This wouldn't be so strange except for the fact that they find a giant ring construct floating between the two objects, which is about 10,000 miles in diameter. Unfortunately for the small ship, the entire Covenant battle fleet had followed them and arrived in the system shortly before.When you boot up the game, you're knee deep in the middle of the Autumn being evacuated. That giant ring construct is Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball and the secret that it holds is the part of the story that will be up to you to discover.GameplayBefore we get into the nuts and bolts of how Halo plays, I'd like to share a few of the quotes blurted out in and around the IGN offices and other places as passers-by were enraptured by a glimpse of Bungie's first person superstar.""Are those guys fighting with you?""""Drive the Jeep! I wanna see the Jeep!""""Damn, this feels like a movie!""""I thought the fun part happened already.""""How come the enemies speak English?""You will fire roughly 4 million rounds at all sorts of alien creatures and vehicles by the time you reach the end of Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball. It's definitely a first person shooter with the emphasis on shoot. But it's how you're motivated to deal all of that damage that makes the experience so enjoyable. And I'm not referring to the backstory of the game either. The artificial intelligence of the enemies is sophisticated enough and increases in difficulty at such a nice steady pace to that you are literally getting better the more you play.There are a handful of basic enemy types that you'll encounter in Halo including the small annoying Grunts, force-field wearing Elites, shield carrying Jackals, terrifying Hunters and the good old cloaking Elites --they carry cool energy swords that you don't want to know about. Each of the different enemy types behaves and attacks according to their specific ""personalities"" and so there are tactics in dealing with each.Grunts are basically chicken-ish and so they like to attack when they have plenty of backup and run away once you isolate them or show your aggression. The magic is in how they express themselves. When Grunts run away they only get so far and hide behind cover before they muster some more courage and pop out again. You simply pop them at will with whatever weapon you have handy.Elites have an entirely different plan. They have shields, just like you, so they're more likely to go toe-to-toe. Once you get their shields down, however, they panic and become even more aggressive with a running melee attack of some kind. Since their shields are down, your best bet is to smash them with a melee attack of your own with whatever weapon you may be carrying. How often have you gotten frustrated in other FPS games and wished you could just smash the enemy in his side-chewing mouth? An up close and personal attack with the butt of your assault rifle is one of the more underrated joys that Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball will bring you.			"

												Possibly the best game themed around Robots playing dodgeball in existence, the minor seizures from the flashing lights and blaring music do very little to take away from the experience, and homing shots are only the most frustrating thing to exist since the creation of the universe as a whole.

												This is just epic.Firstly: the neon-styled graphics don't tire your eyes at all, I've played for hours with no problem.It's dodgeball but without pesky limits, with balls everwhere and optional teammates (you can play alone against a whole squad), the AI is actually pretty good without being overpowered and online play is actually possible despite lag (there's a little lag but it's still playable to a point you can score with no problem and catch balls in the air most of the time).The arcade mode is just amazing, you got bosses with different abilities that need a different strategy to beat and the abilities you are able to unlock are actually not only useful but creative.It's every dodgeball lover's dream and also a great game for those who like reflex based games.Also: I've found some players, comunity's not dead, just depends on which day and time you log in, not worth waiting for more than 7 minutes on a player empty match, play offline and try again later.

Music and flashy gameplay may cause negative side effects medicaly but the solid ball whipping action was a blast with friends.The bots were challeging so even without them or in random servers it was fun.More epic when i got my hockey mask and wizard hat			"

								Ridiculously fun take on the competitive online shooter. Moving your robot and landing shots take a bit of practice but once you've got the hang of it the controls are deeply satisfying and reminds me of old days playing low-grav maps in Unreal Tournament or Quake 3. The game's furious pace is set by it's pumping background music and combined with it's fast respawns and tight maps mean the action is always tense and fluid. If you get tired of plain old deathmatch there are a wide variety of game modes from scoring goals in floating neon hoops to playing keep away. Bottom line, get this game because it's damn fun and can only get better.			"

								Here is a game, that tries to do something different. With the FPS genre getting flooded with the same boring repetitive spray and pray gameplay, Disco Dodgeball comes around and completely took over my PC. Simply put, the amount of time and effort put into this game is enough to warrant at least downloading the free demo. It's a FPS with Robots on wheels, and they try to throw high powered dodgeballs at you, what more do you want? The gameplay is smooth, and the soundtrack is wicked awesome. I highly reccomend this game. It's the most fun I've ever had in a game by myself. And it's even better with friends. Do yourself a favor and try this one out.			"

								It looks like an early 00s shareware game, but it plays and sounds awesome. It's like a Quake instagib sort-of arena kind of game, with moustached robots and dodgeballs. Although the player base is understandably quite low at the moment, the bot matches are equally fun thanks to a quite decent AI.Easily recommended if you're into this kind of games and have friends to play it with.

								If this game has one thing going for it: it's the Aesthetic. Not just visual, it sounds amazing. The soundtrack and visuals match up perfectly and create a wonderful masterpiece that wholly consumes me and I love it to death. The gameplay? It's great as well. Imagine dodgeball but with no boundaries, silly powerups, and fun motion mechanics. It's challenging (if you want it to be!) and fun.  single player vs bots (with a ""campaign"" in the works), and multiplayer with full broadcasting support in lobbies make it perfect for tournaments and competitive play, as well as extremely fun casual games.I wholly recommend purchasing this game even in its current state.

												Hipster name, but the game works. Simple dodgeball simulator, with robots.It weights little, the gameplay is easy to get into: you pick a ball, load the shot, shoot it, if it hits, you get a frag.You also can do a (small) jump, and a (small) sprint.Has powerups, such as returning ball (more useful than it sounds), jetpack, longer sprint, bigger ball, and similar. Not game changing, but can spice up the gameplay.As far as I played, there was no situation of some player hogging up a cool powerup and winning the match this way: death is the great equalizer. Everyone gets destroyed and often, the respawn time is almost null, maps are tight. This provides for frenetic action.Small hiccup would be the movement, it's not fluid, but clunky. Your jumps are really small, you can't run really fast, sometimes you keep going even though you're not pressing anything: for all intents and purposes you're controlling a vehicle. Robot on wheels to be exact, not an fps character, so forget bunnyjumping, crouching or covers, you've got a limited set of movements and you're expected to make the best out of them.Flaw or feature, that's for you to decide, but it's still something you'll have to get used to if you plan on plaiyng properly.There's a leveling up system, and you get drops that you can use to craft better skins for your character, a way to keep interest going after you've played all the maps and tried all the modes.Speaking of that, the game doesn't really offer lots of diversity: regardless of the variations, you're still throwing balls at robots in a symmetrical arena with colors flashing to disco music.I'd compare this game to ratz:instagib or rocket league, it's a fast arena game, that will prove really amusing for the 10 to 20 minutes you'll be playing it. But gets dry if you try to dedicate more to it. Not that you can't, and the game encourages you to, but you've already seen all it has to offer. ""been there, done that"".When it's on sale for 5$ or less, it's worth it, as a 5$ title. 15$ wouldn't really recommend, unless you desperately have a vehicular dodgeball arena simulator itch you need to scratch.

								This is obviously a game meant to be played with friends instead of bots. It's what amounts to dodgeball on Segway; you roll around and slam people in the face with neon explodey death. I have no idea how active the community is; when I was playing, it dipped from 40 in game to 3 - again, play with friends. Pricewise? I feel a little jipped, but not too bad.

												Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is one of the best games I have ever played that is not a Valve Inc. game.Why should you get this game?It is widely unknown, which always angers me. It is a skill based dodgeball tournament style game which relies on physics and control to win. There are so many options for single player that is amazes me. You can mess around with physics and many other features. The difficulty of the bots is very balanced and it is easy to progress skill to a peak.I can go on for hours about this game, but I would rather be playing it for hours. The music selection is awesome. I recommend downloading the soundtrack. You can also play the game by uploading your own music to listen to as you venture the neon maps.As I was saying before, there are so many options in this game as well as types of objectives. Think of 5th grade gym class. Then imagine each kid being a neon robot on a wheel. Then imagine this game of dodgeball is in a black room with lights and music as if you were in an amazing adults only disco club. That sums up the gameplay portion pretty well.There are many options for lag. This game works well in a window and is easy to make adjust to your needs. Overall, definately get this game on sale. Even then, you should just get this game whenever. $10.00 or less is an excellent price because you will get a bang for your buck. It is one of those games you can play for a long time without getting bored because of all the options you could change as the player.The only disadvantage is that is not being updated so often and community maps should also be an option. It also is a very small community so online mode is sort of annoying to have to wait so long. I love the attacks, achievements, and everything else. This is my example of a 10/10 game.~thedubmark			"

								I bought this game in support of games that are compatible with Linux. That being said, I didn't buy it on a whim. It seemed like a fun arena type game to kill some time with. Which it is. RR-DDD is a very simple but easy to pick up game that will have you hooked for quite a while.There are different modes with team based play, and FFA options so the variety that is available makes things interesting. The core mechanics are nice too. If you've ever played dodgeball in real life, it's the same thing. There are also various power-ups to get, which change your strategy slightly. The bots in a match can be challenging, which is nice. As for a couple of downsides: This game seems to be from a very small operation development-wise. So updates may come a bit slower than other games. Also, sometimes the ball doesn't register as a hit when you clearly see it bounce off the opponent on your screen. Lastly, servers are hosted by players on their local machine. This means that since there aren't a ton of people playing, there aren't many servers to play on. When there are, the quality of the connection varies based on the host's connection speed. All in all a great game. I would definitely recommend buying it if it goes on sale for any amount.			"

								Here is a game, that tries to do something different. With the FPS genre getting flooded with the same boring repetitive spray and pray gameplay, Disco Dodgeball comes around and completely took over my PC. Simply put, the amount of time and effort put into this game is enough to warrant at least downloading the free demo. It's a FPS with Robots on wheels, and they try to throw high powered dodgeballs at you, what more do you want? The gameplay is smooth, and the soundtrack is wicked awesome. I highly reccomend this game. It's the most fun I've ever had in a game by myself. And it's even better with friends. Do yourself a favor and try this one out.			"

If you loved dodgeball as a kid, I'm positive you'll love this game! Even though it is not a rage game, it can get frustrating if you can't get kills, but that's just more of a reason to practice and play!

												Hipster name, but the game works. Simple dodgeball simulator, with robots.It weights little, the gameplay is easy to get into: you pick a ball, load the shot, shoot it, if it hits, you get a frag.You also can do a (small) jump, and a (small) sprint.Has powerups, such as returning ball (more useful than it sounds), jetpack, longer sprint, bigger ball, and similar. Not game changing, but can spice up the gameplay.As far as I played, there was no situation of some player hogging up a cool powerup and winning the match this way: death is the great equalizer. Everyone gets destroyed and often, the respawn time is almost null, maps are tight. This provides for frenetic action.Small hiccup would be the movement, it's not fluid, but clunky. Your jumps are really small, you can't run really fast, sometimes you keep going even though you're not pressing anything: for all intents and purposes you're controlling a vehicle. Robot on wheels to be exact, not an fps character, so forget bunnyjumping, crouching or covers, you've got a limited set of movements and you're expected to make the best out of them.Flaw or feature, that's for you to decide, but it's still something you'll have to get used to if you plan on plaiyng properly.There's a leveling up system, and you get drops that you can use to craft better skins for your character, a way to keep interest going after you've played all the maps and tried all the modes.Speaking of that, the game doesn't really offer lots of diversity: regardless of the variations, you're still throwing balls at robots in a symmetrical arena with colors flashing to disco music.I'd compare this game to ratz:instagib or rocket league, it's a fast arena game, that will prove really amusing for the 10 to 20 minutes you'll be playing it. But gets dry if you try to dedicate more to it. Not that you can't, and the game encourages you to, but you've already seen all it has to offer. ""been there, done that"".When it's on sale for 5$ or less, it's worth it, as a 5$ title. 15$ wouldn't really recommend, unless you desperately have a vehicular dodgeball arena simulator itch you need to scratch.

								This is obviously a game meant to be played with friends instead of bots. It's what amounts to dodgeball on Segway; you roll around and slam people in the face with neon explodey death. I have no idea how active the community is; when I was playing, it dipped from 40 in game to 3 - again, play with friends. Pricewise? I feel a little jipped, but not too bad. I imagine my opinion will change once the game picks up momentum, so I'm just going to leave a recommended here, just be aware of what you're purchasing for 10 dollars.			"

												Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is one of the best games I have ever played that is not a Valve Inc. game.Why should you get this game?It is widely unknown, which always angers me. It is a skill based dodgeball tournament style game which relies on physics and control to win. There are so many options for single player that is amazes me. You can mess around with physics and many other features. The difficulty of the bots is very balanced and it is easy to progress skill to a peak.I can go on for hours about this game, but I would rather be playing it for hours. The music selection is awesome. I recommend downloading the soundtrack. You can also play the game by uploading your own music to listen to as you venture the neon maps.As I was saying before, there are so many options in this game as well as types of objectives. Think of 5th grade gym class. Then imagine each kid being a neon robot on a wheel. Then imagine this game of dodgeball is in a black room with lights and music as if you were in an amazing adults only disco club. That sums up the gameplay portion pretty well.There are many options for lag. This game works well in a window and is easy to make adjust to your needs. Overall, definately get this game on sale. Even then, you should just get this game whenever. $10.00 or less is an excellent price because you will get a bang for your buck. It is one of those games you can play for a long time without getting bored because of all the options you could change as the player.The only disadvantage is that is not being updated so often and community maps should also be an option. It also is a very small community so online mode is sort of annoying to have to wait so long. I love the attacks, achievements, and everything else. This is my example of a 10/10 game.~thedubmark			"

												Full review can be seen here - https://www.youtube.com/embed/kjtVfcPzgg8THE GOOD*Non-stop first person dodgeball throwing that feels as intense as COD.*A beautiful blend of strategy and chance.*Pulling off trick shots is very rewarding.THE BAD *The controls require a real time investment in order to get used to them.*Lack of polish in visuals and spectator mode.*Cosmetic items are hidden behind a paywall.Score: 8.5Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball may seem like a shovelware experience from the outside, but when you put yourself on the droid’s wheel, you’ll find a high-octane and competitive twitch-based shooter that’s guaranteed to shake the most hardcore of gamers. While there are problems in the experience, they’re ones you can expect from a low-budget game. Like Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars before Rocket League, I believe Disco Dodgeball is one of those fantastic ideas that just needs a little more polish.Anyone who enjoys first person shooters should honestly consider. Sadly, there’s not a huge fan base with this game, but the ones that are there are friendly and supportive, and there’s a nice catalogue of guides to help you learn the ropes. It’s non-stop frantic fun that gets more rewarding as you become a stronger droid, and nothing tops the excitement of catching a dodgeball mid-air and taking out an opponent with that same ball. While it may not be ready for primetime, this feel like an exceptional pre-cursor to what could be the next major E-Sport.			"

												Do you remember playing dodgeball in school? Do you remember that one nerdy kid sitting in the corner trying to avoid being pelted by balls? Well Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is for you , its a fast paced arena shooter that can run on a lot of PC's.  Besides its only 10.99 and that is a steal for a laugh and a good time. You can also buy a four pack so that you and your friends can play the game together. Be warned the game is region locked so your friend will have to purchase a copy from their region. That isn't the dev's fault that is just steam being steam on a regular basis.  The graphics aren't the flashiest thing ever , but its not supposed to be a AAA FPS With a complex storyline entailing the journey of Dodge McBall a rouge agent or some wierd stuff like that. But its a game about playing dodgeball and the lower graphical settings mean more flashing lights and less time trying to spot an enemy from the background of the arena.  The sound is awesome having a pumping soundtrack really can get you in the mood and rythym of picking up the balls and knocking your opponents out. Did I mention a KO entails a little particle explosion.  Seriously this game is insanely fun and definitely is worth the pick up and hey sometimes it's on sale for an even lower price. So don't miss out on some cheap chaotic fun and pick it up today.			"

								Easily one of the best games that you can casually play. From the cover of this game, the name sounds a little wonky, the music only sounded good in the trailer, and it looked a little amusing. Little did I know that this $10.00 game was one of the best casual FPS games that I've ever bought. If you were ever the kid who really liked dodgeball in gym class, this is the game for you. I can't tell you that I've never felt so badass as I have playing this game (well, I can, but when you hear ""MID-AIR CATCH"" announced by the movie trailer guy, you get excited. And this happens ALOT, adding up to the most badass experience). This game deserves the good rating it has, and if the game doesn't make you want to buy this, the soundtrack will. Probably, next to VVVVVV and Hotline Miami, has one of the best soundtracks out there. The music really sets the tune in the game, and plays a huge factor in how easy it is to get lost in this game. If you have 10 dollars that you can spend, I'd highly reccomend this game!			"

								Exciting, funny, and sometimes annoyingly difficult, Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball (henceforth Disco Dodgeball) is a ton of fun. With some rather interesting mechanics, Disco Dodgeball finally gives some of that first person dodgeball action that everyone knows and loves. Grabbing, catching, and throwing those neon-colored balls has never felt so entertaining. Matches are held in arenas with intriguing map design, wall equalizers included. Bonus points for the amazing (though short) soundtrack, which constantly plays in the background as you rack up the kills.Take note, if you have weak eyes or are susceptible to epileptic seizures, do avoid this game, as flashing lights are present in this game. And if you hate electronic dance music, you probably won't enjoy the soundtrack either.But if none of those apply to you, then this game is definitely worth a shot. Besides, why wouldn't you want to be a robot with a glorious mustache playing dodgeball in a club?			"

								You're probably wondering ""What in the WORLD is Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball"", right? The simple answer is a game you'll love. Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball (RRDDD or just Disco Dodgeball) is a fast-paced high-flying game where the simple objective is to take a dodgeball and SLAM it into your oponent's face. Don't be fooled though, RRDDD isn't a game that you can jump into and instantly be bestowed the title ""President of the Galaxy"", it takes practice and time to improve your disco dodging skills. The AI can be adjusted to suit your experience making the game fun to play for players of all skill levels.Disco Dodgeball includes assorted gamemodes so gameplay never becomes stale and a few challenge modes for you to test your skills. What kind of game would this be if you weren't able to dominate your friends in multiplayer? Bots, despite their very human-like appearance, can sometimes be tiring, so just find a match on multiplayer jump right in!Amazing graphics, spectacular music, caring developer, Disco Dodgeball is a must and deffinitely worth your time			"

And the soundtrack, the moustaches, level design, glowing lights, the announcer (his laugh is also amazing!), the soundtrack, gamemodes and generally. A really fun and interesting game. I would recommend buying it. Huge thumb up. Did I mention the soundtrack is amazing?			"

												This game is absolutely amazing. Got it pretty cheap during the summer sale, but it is more than worth the normal price. Sadly, there aren't a whole lot of people that play this a lot so you have to get on during the ""prime"" hours. Buying the four pack and giving it to a few friends was so worth it. This game is awesome just to sit back and have some mindless fun with your friends while listening to some amazing music. I love this game.			"

								Bought this game after reading a few reviews on it, it's awesome.Simple game, easy to run and fun to enjoy multiplayer. It has a good atmopshere and a brilliant use of the lighting and music.The game is early in development however it's very very playable. Sometimes the multiplayer latency can result in some odd kills and some weird deaths but i can forgive that easily as i know it's part and parcel of every multiplayer game.The developer(s) seem keen on improving things with every update and i have high hopes for where this game might end up/10/1011/10 with rice			"

								Ridiculously fun take on the competitive online shooter. Moving your robot and landing shots take a bit of practice but once you've got the hang of it the controls are deeply satisfying and reminds me of old days playing low-grav maps in Unreal Tournament or Quake 3. The game's furious pace is set by it's pumping background music and combined with it's fast respawns and tight maps mean the action is always tense and fluid. If you get tired of plain old deathmatch there are a wide variety of game modes from scoring goals in floating neon hoops to playing keep away. Bottom line, get this game because it's damn fun and can only get better.			"

								It looks like an early 00s shareware game, but it plays and sounds awesome. It's like a Quake instagib sort-of arena kind of game, with moustached robots and dodgeballs. Although the player base is understandably quite low at the moment, the bot matches are equally fun thanks to a quite decent AI.Easily recommended if you're into this kind of games and have friends to play it with.

Did I ever think, if such a game did exist, that it would have the great feel of Quake and be the most incredibly fun, addicting to exist? Definitely not!This game blew my mind - I've always loved dodgeball and, being an old school gamer, now I can experience it on a greatly built engine that gives a flawless encounter of what dodgeball should really be like in my eyes! A fast-paced, sport-like rave!Not only this, but I have completely filled the playlist with custom music which makes it even more thrilling for me!

								Easily one of the best games that you can casually play. From the cover of this game, the name sounds a little wonky, the music only sounded good in the trailer, and it looked a little amusing. Little did I know that this $10.00 game was one of the best casual FPS games that I've ever bought. If you were ever the kid who really liked dodgeball in gym class, this is the game for you. I can't tell you that I've never felt so badass as I have playing this game (well, I can, but when you hear ""MID-AIR CATCH"" announced by the movie trailer guy, you get excited. And this happens ALOT, adding up to the most badass experience). This game deserves the good rating it has, and if the game doesn't make you want to buy this, the soundtrack will. Probably, next to VVVVVV and Hotline Miami, has one of the best soundtracks out there. The music really sets the tune in the game, and plays a huge factor in how easy it is to get lost in this game. If you have 10 dollars that you can spend, I'd highly reccomend this game!			"

												This game is amazing. I first saw it on a gaming channel (Markiplier - if you don't know who that is, he's amazing too), and I knew I had to buy the heck out of it.And boy, did this pay off.From the amazing lighting and visual effects to gameplay that only makes you want more, from the astounsing music (and the map which lights according to it) to the very core of the hilarius concept of robots playing dodgeball while being on fire - this game is everything it needs to be, except popular.Pros Music - The music is so awesome and the beat is amazing. What it lacks in diversity it makes up to by the pure joy of listening to it while blasting dodgeballs into enemies. Also, music packs are already available for download in the workshop, so it doesn't even lack diversity AND IS CUSTOMIZABLE (as in, downloading only what you want).  Gameplay - It's always challenging. Even after hours of playing it, there's always new things to learn, more things to practice, new game modes, new trick shots, new difficulties and new game-modifiers. Sniping a player from half-way across the map with a well-aimed ball has never been this satisfying. No scope? You got it.  Lighting - In most games, basic lighting is what you'll expect, and what you'll get. But on Disco Dodgeball, this is not the case. The map has neon lights everywhere, that change their color and match their intensity with the music's beat, which adds more than you'd think to the awesome feeling of this game.  Satisfaction - Every single kill, be it a bot or a player, is super satisfying. You'll love every minute of it. That being said....Cons Graphics - All that amazing lighting and effects don't come free. While low quality isn't a major downer on the fun, driving it up is very costly on the graphics card. My nVidia GTX 960M, for example, can only run it on medium quality, and setting it to high will make it drop to about 13FPS. Not being popular enough - While I don't think this is the game's fault, the powerful, almost lag-free servers are almost always empty. There are simply not enough players. That doesn't make the game all that bad either, as bots and modifiers never get old. Overall rating - 9.5/10. Worth every second. "

												This game is addictive. Like, really really addictive. Gameplay consists of controlling a robot that you can customize and going into a disco skate park and throwing dodgeballs at other robots or completing the objectives of the other game modes. The basic mechanics are just like dodgeball itself. -Go find a ball. -Catch one thrown at you. -Dude who throws it is out and/or(I dont play the team modes alot) a teammate comes back in. -Another ball thrown at you. -Block it. -Throw it at dude. -Miss because you keep thinking you have a gun instead. -Realize you play too much Doom. -Rinse, repeat. Normally when it comes to multiplayer only games like this I get bored very quickly. But a few things keep me coming back. Some of the levels have a great design with multiple levels allowing attacks from above or a well place shot from below. And with physics coming into play you can find yourself easily flying in the air and throwing a ball at a faraway target and scoring an awesome kill prompting the announcer to yell ""mid-air"" or ""top-gun"". Everytime you get a kill through a trick-shot, the announcer says the name and not gonna lie, picking up a ball then immediately throwing it at a guy with ""quick-draw"" popping up feels pretty badass. And to top it all off the music is just plain awesome, getting your adrenaline pumping for some awesome dodgeball action. However their are only around 10 tracks in the game so I recommend getting a few more from the workshop.Their are about 10 multiplayer modes with most being able to switch from free for all to teams. There is also an arcade mode for singleplayer where you play increasingly difficult levels, buying upgrades and fighting bosses until you become president of the galaxy. If you lose all your lives however, you start all over. Along with that, their are 4 challenge modes that have tasks such as a basic survival mode and a mode where you are invincible and need to rack up as many points as possible. There are also offline bot matches to play which is where I've racked up a majority of my 10 hours playtime. Online is also pretty good. Even with my ♥♥♥♥ internet surprisingly. The netcode I had read about before must have been patched or something because I was able to pull off trick shots online just as well.Pros-Fun Skill-based gameplay-Multi-leveled arenas are awesome-Awesome Quake inspired announcer-Trickshots feel awesome to do-Music-Music...again-Not a grey and brown shooter...or loadouts(sorry I had to rip on modern shooters)-MoustachesCons-I sometimes get caught for a second on walls or rails-A kill cam might be good to see some pro-strat kills-The flatter maps are a little meh. Their great at first but levels like Temple are awesome-The hats area of customization is empty at first...I really want a top hat and monacleMisc-There are modifiers. But I only use the big head mode. The rest I feel would just kinda ruin it. Like low grav. Don't do it. But meh they don't detract from the overall productConclusion: Buy it. Lose your life. Worried about purchasing without liking it? Get the demo. Review not funny enough? Well fuddle duddle look at my icon. Smile.Moustaches			"

												ROBOT ROLLER-DERBY DISCO DODGEBALL!R.R.D.D.D.Now I don't like the review games until I've played them for quite some time, but this truly is something special. Essentially a twitch shooter in the vein of Quake, Unreal, with a bit of RIchochet-y vibe thrown in (where's Richochet: Source GabeN??), this color drenched, electrictronic dance music stuffed masterpiece worth everyone's attention. I love dodgeball. Who doesn't? Maybe I'm in love with this game just because as a chubby child I was always picked last for the game in P.E. and this is a way for me to live out my childhood. Regardless, this game is about an intense, over the top dodgeball match involving robots skating around on weird unicyle wheels while bright colors and music pulse continously. The game even follows all the standard rules of dodgeball; you can catch balls, bounce balls back if you're holding a ball, and during elimination modes you even get your teamates back in by catching the ball. There are plenty of game modes, from standard FFA and team deathmatch modes, to capture the flag and a basketball-like hoop mode. Surprisingly enough for a multiplayer focused game, the single player is pretty fleshed out, including various challenges and boss modes to get you warmed up for the multiplayer.Dodgeball fits into the twitch based shooter genre like a pair of well worn jeans. The balls travel at a pretty slow rate compared to projectiles in other video games, so there is definitely a large amount of skill involved on leading and hitting each target. In addition to this, the afore-mentioned unicyle wheels make it more difficult to maneuver around instead of the standard WASD. However, after some practice you'll learn to use the movement system to your own advantage, hoping around and out-juking your opponents. When you land a badass trickshot by jumping over your opponents head, avoiding his mis-aimed toss, and slamming your ball into his face. That's amazing. When you strafe sideways, catch an opponents ball and jump into the air, spinning around to nail his buddy in the side.That's really freaking amazing. The game is chock-full of moments like this.Don't take my word for it, try out the free demo in the store page. Within ten seconds you'll see what I'm talking about. My main fear is the viability of the long term multiplayer community, but so far, a game of this quality will have hardcore fans that will stick around for a long, long time. I will admit I was skeptical seeing the game's ridiculously overwhelmingly positive reviews on steam. But they were all correct. This game is amazing.			"

												One of the most entertaining games in my library.It's fast, intense, silly, and awesome. It's one of those games that is amazing in small doses. Play a couple matches every once in a while, and it's great. Play it more often and it's kinda frustrating.In the multiplayer mode, which I imagine would be the most popular, I end up in games where half the teams are bots. While I normally like this feature, the bots are just way too accurate, and can be frustrating. This is most noticeable in Hoops, where the bots will get the ball, and make insanely fast and accurate shots into the hoop the moment they're able. I've also gotten stuck a small number of times, but other than that, it's been bug-free for me.I feel this game is for fans of multiplayer first person shooters that grew tired of the immature crowd that ruined Halo, CoD, and Battlefield. Those games may be more polished, but it's not by much. And they take themselves too seriously, which is great for 14 year olds, but those of us with some gaming experience tend to enjoy the silliness factor of gaming a bit more.Overall, this game may not get as many hours played as other games like Skyrim or Cities: Skylines, but I'm glad I have this in my library. It's a blast to play a couple matches every now and then.Highly recommended			"

This is one of most amazing ideas i have seen; old style arena with great music, amazing, simply and neon graphics and of course fantastic gameplay. There is fun even playing with bots!Everything that this game needs is more players and developer, who will not stop evolving this game, cause he is doing great job.Oh, I almost forget; there are mustaches.

The controls are a little slippery at times, but I get the feeling they're supposed to be. The soundtrack is excellent, and you even get the option to add your own music.

												Not a bad game, not a great game. But worth the investment if nothing else than to just play for a few minutes when your not feeling other games. Its an arena style shooter with quite the twist and for the most part as long as the games host has a good internet connection, the game itself can be fun for a short while.			"

												So, lets be honest. I originally downloaded this game for 2 reasons. 1: it was on sale. 2: I found the title to be entirely to awesome to pass up.What I found: A game that needs a bigger player base.Its fast, its chotic, and even when you lose its fun. Controls are simple, the objective, even in the non traditional styles of dodgeball, is simple. in turn is easy to learn, easy to play, which I find makes it easier to play, even with others.The music does get a little repetitive, and would not really fall under any form of disco, but between it and the 99.9% of all arenas being rave lights, it definately has a distraction factor I didnt foresee.I lost my point, but I will say this..

												Ok so I have seen a lot of hate on this game and most of it is due to controlls. Listen if you don't know how to get to a new controll type then play only one game your entire life this game is amazing. Also it's wierd controlls help it become a better game. The concept of not stopping makes it a lot easier to  do more trick shots. This game is not a perfect game yes and I do feel like it's a little overpriced but that doesn't mean that you can't get it during a sale like come on steam does sales like crazy eventually this one will pop up and the only real problem I see with this game is ledges and mid air controlls but mid air controlls I just have to master in the end this game is insanley fun and a good time killer and I would deffinantly recomend it.

Different game modes deliver tons of variety for single and multiplayer.Even if there are not many players online, you can still enjoy the game by playing the normal modes against bots, one of the interesting challenge modes or the newly added arcade mode.The developer is very connected to the community and can be interacted with at the games subreddit reddit.com/r/DiscoDodgeballSoundtrack and visuals are awesome too!

It is both.Fantastic music, the lighting engine is quite good and fits well with the game. Some lag on launch day depending on who's hosting, but that's to be expected.  I'm so happy to see this game finally launch, because this will be a go to for a few hours of fun for many years as long as people are still around playing it.Gameplay is a blast and controls pretty well.  Some floatyness in jumping, but it is intended. Mutators available for play and a single player mode that is still a lot of fun, but where it shines is multiplayer. Very friendly community of helpful players, and generally just a great time to hang out with people and play.tldr; Unreal Tournament with dodgeballs. Buy it.			"

								A bit of Tribes mixed with an Arena shooter like Quake III; Disco Dodgeball is fast paced, stylistic, challenging, and most importantly fun. The game is well balanced on account of only having a single weapon and the levels are tight but well thought out just as they should be with an arena shooter. Graphics are clean and flashy and the music is ""bumpin"" as the kids would say if kids said that. While some things maybe require a little more refinement (menus and matchmaking) the core game is extremely well put together. As long as the community holds up strong I can recommend this game without hesitation. Easily the best early access game I've seen.			"

I even had a chance to play a couple games with him while the game was still in development.This game is a brilliant example of what Unity Engine games can and should be.I'll be completely honest and say that my favorite part of this game is the announcer.

												Robot Roller Derby Disco Dodgeball has been a fantastic success while in Early Access and it is great to see it get a full release.  This game has a quirky physics engine that makes the seemingly easy game of dodgeball rather complex and fun to master.  An amazing community has developed around RRDDD which makes the multiplayer experience that much more enjoyable.  This is one of the best titles to have come out of Greenlight and the development has been a resounding success.  Robot Roller Derby Disco Dodgeball is a steal for the price.

 General Overview I've just purchased Robot Roller Derby Disco Dodgeball and have been playing it for about a day, but I can't seem to put it down. It's that good.Basically you and a couple of buds or random strangers team up and play Dodgeball all while picking up powerups littered around the stage that give you or your balls(teehee!) special effects. It's a rather brilliant idea that is only augmented by the whole soundtrack and flashing lights going on around you. The game is bright and colorful and rather nice to look at. One of the things I enjoyed is that this game doesn't try to be anything more than what it is, it's simply dodgeball with robots, flashing lights, and kickass music. What could be better? Gameplay This is one of the most important elements of Robot Roller Derby Disco Dodgeball. It's dodgeball, but dodgeball with a fun spin on things. The controls feel nice and fluent and never slippery and the speedboost and jump system feel solid and just plain fun to pull off. The action is tense and high-pace and the music and strobe light effects augment that fastpace gameplay into an incredibly enjoyable experience. There's also powerups littered around the map to keep things interesting. You can pick up jetpacks, make your balls home in on enemies (teehee!), make your balls on fire into fireballs (teehee!) and so, so much more. It's simply the paragon of fun at its finest. PROS FunSoundtrackPretty to look atToaster Friendly Bots in servers work well enough On sale(7.50USD at the time of this review)Make ball jokes with your friends!Did I mention fun? CONS Servers can sometimes be empty and full of bots.From what I've seen hacking and exploiting of glitches in online servers may be common Ending Statements Do you like having fun? If yes get Robot Roller Derby Disco Dodgeball, you won't be disappointed. Edit:  fixed a word			"

Early Access Review
								I first found this game from my favorite Youtube group, and immediately fell in love.  I got the game (thanks Erik!) and have  been playing nonstop.  Usually, early access games are decent, but need a lot of work.  RRDDD is not like that.  It is extremely fun and addicting.  One of my favorite parts about this game is the music.  It is perfect and extremely good!  The game was made by one guy, and he has done a phenominal job!  I've had a few chats with him, he is a down to earth guy who is really into the community.			"

												Nice concept,well executed,amazing soundtrack and good level design.The neon filled levels and the soothing disco soundtrack really goes well along with the one shot one kill mechanic of the game.The variety modes and level are high and quite unexpected from a budget game like this.The game is simple but spices things up with the various power-ups which adds a good variety to the game overall.My biggest complaint would be the game is has very few to no people at times so if you want to play it for hours grab a few friends and play your heart out.Highly recommended.

								More people need to play this game, I mean just the name itself is awesome. The music is just fantastic and it really makes you feel like your in a disco club hitting robots with dodgeballs! The graphics are crazy and the gameplay is really competitive. So many gamemodes and beautiful maps, and you can even customize your robot, mine has googles and a bushy stache! The community is just great, and I really recommend this game. #lasers			"

												As its name suggests, Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball (what a descriptive title!) is a game where you control robots playing dodgeball in a disco nightclub. What's not to love? This game is fun, fast-paced, and skill-based. You WILL have a blast rolling around the disco while trying to nail your opponents with the ball and dodging their throws. Perhaps most impressive for this sort of game is that there truly is enough content to justify the game's price. There are multiple singleplayer modes, including the addicting arcade mode that pits you against wave after wave of opponents. However, the game was designed first and foremost as a multiplayer ""shooter,"" and the multiplayer is a blast. The game's community is relatively small, but it's large enough that I never have any trouble finding several games going on in my region (East Coast USA).Overall, this is simple, silly fun, but there's certainly more than enough variety, challenge, and depth to justify paying the full price. I got this in a Humble Bundle and didn't expect much, but Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is a diamond in the rough.			"

												This game, like One Finger Death Punch, does only a few things. But it does these things amazingly well. It's a blast to slide around at high speed dodging balls whilst rocking out to the amazing music that the game has. The slow-mo adds a nice punch to your throw and the game doesn't shy away from buffeting you with a barrage of dodgeables. It's simple (not mindless mind you) fun, I wouldn't play it for more than 30 minutes a time but the online multiplayer only takes mere seconds for you to connect, and provides a fun and chaotic environment for you to kick some ♥♥♥. If you're into high-speed skill based games, this is definitely a game for you. But keep those last words in mind, you stop moving, and you'll die.			"

												You know what, this is a great game and I wish I played it more often than I do. It's one of those games that is ridiculously fun to play with people. The AI is boring and so therefore it's not a game to play with by yourself. With a group of friends, you guys will have a blast. There is a variety of game modes, such as a basketball like mode or a mode where you need to hang on to a certain ball for a certain amount of time first, but death match is just where the real fun and this game's strong point is. There is a lot of powerups, there is great player customization, and there is (for some reason) item drops you can use to sell, trade, or create cosmetic stuff with. No, I mean like legit actual items, like steam item drops. Weird for an obscure indie game to implement that feature, isn't it? Granted, 16 of my friends already have this game, so I suppose it isn't too obscure. Regardless, if you are looking for a game with some meat on it for a decent price even outside of a sale, you found it. The gameplay is fast paced, it's fun, it's simple, it's just good. There is only negative experiences I've had, such as people catching my shots from ridiculous distances from them, that I feel had more to do with connection issues (my friends are all ♥♥♥♥ing europeons for some reason, damn foriegners). However, I do notice the ball can still be caught even after hitting a wall or the ground, which I think is unfair and unnecessary. The game could have more content if the developer had the desire to add anymore I feel, but I think the asking price is still fair for what you're getting. So don't think to hesitate. 7/10Pros-Good fast & simple gameplayFairly unique take on the genreGood enough amount of varietyCons-I feel the game could have more content such as more maps and the likes, maybe even the ability for users to make their own maps.I feel sometimes that catching is ridiculous, especially when it has already hit the ground.AI sucks real hard and online isn't overwhelmingly active, you will need friends.

												In most cases, you want someone who has a large number of hours playing a game to give a review. In the case of this game, that isn't needed. WIthing 10 hours, everybody knows if they like this game or not. Except that EVERYBODY loves this game. Play it once and you'll be addicted as you zoom around, dodging balls, making awesome throws, rocking out to music, and so much more. The game is constantly updated- an amazing task for such a simple game - and allows for there to be Workshop items to be constantly downloaded and used. Overall the game is great. But after a few games, you run into a problem-- very few people play this game as a whole, and they are further divided by location around the world. While this can put a damper on some round, when everybody leaves and you're stuck with some OP bots, it has its upsides. As you get to play more, you see certain players more often and start to build teams with random people and even learn play style. So, even with its faults, it is an amazing game, everyone should play at least once.--Edit--At just under 100 hours and climbing past level 78, I have seen the many changes of this game. The game itself is under constant renovation and is always adapting and evolving to meet the needs of its community. I am happy to sit for hours with my friends and play this amazingly simple game. While I do not play it as often as before, it will forever be in debt to this game for the many wonderful memories it has given me.			"

												I've played RRDDD for a little over 100 hours. I got it the week it came out. No matter what you say about it, you can't deny that it has improved a lot.Graphics:There exactly the right amount of detail on each map. Most of the graphics are on the walls, which is good. There's lights that flash to the music and every surface is textured. There are nice-looking particle effects and the graphics are all-round polished. There isn't an extraordinary amount of detail but I feel anything more wouldn't help the game at all and would end up being distracting.Audio:The music is great. Its techno tunes from a bunch of different artists. You can even add your own songs to the playlist and listen to those, or grab some from the workshop. The sound effects are great too. They’re all present and sound right.Gameplay:There are probably people better suited to review this. In my personal opinion, it’s really fun and engaging. There are a bunch of maps with a bunch of gamemodes. Gameplay is mostly skill based and competitive. I did of course find myself getting a bit frustrated sometimes, but that’s the case with any game.Features:-Good singleplayer and bots-Workshop support-Drops and crafting system-Cards and achievementsNegatives:-lag.

								This game is one of the best first person multiplayer games I have ever played. Keep in mind I have played call of duty, Halo, Destiny, Titanfall, Team Fortress 2,the Counter strike series, and garry's mod. This is one of the best fps games because it is easy to learn to play and you can easily play it with freinds, easily customize matches, no extra places to spend money, as well as different modes to suit your play style that is both fun with yourself, but even better with friends. The Powerups this game has will also boost the fun level to new hights if you so choose to use it.Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball has an amazing soundtrack that you can listen to for hours and best of all you can have a balls to the wall match that has all the powerups in the game on all at once, that combonation makes for some pretty epic games. In conclusion this game is super fun, and the more people play, the more fun it gets. The price for this game is amazing if you want a great Fps that you can play with your friends and also play by yourself. There are also constant updates that make the game get better and better, this combined with a great dev that listens is a killing blow to garbage broken overpriced fps's that are basicaly rinse and repeat every year. I would buy this game again if I had to, but since I don't I'm going to go play it now!			"

												I've played RRDDD for a little over 100 hours. I got it the week it came out. No matter what you say about it, you can't deny that it has improved a lot.Graphics:There exactly the right amount of detail on each map. Most of the graphics are on the walls, which is good. There's lights that flash to the music and every surface is textured. There are nice-looking particle effects and the graphics are all-round polished. There isn't an extraordinary amount of detail but I feel anything more wouldn't help the game at all and would end up being distracting.Audio:The music is great. Its techno tunes from a bunch of different artists. You can even add your own songs to the playlist and listen to those, or grab some from the workshop. The sound effects are great too. They’re all present and sound right.Gameplay:There are probably people better suited to review this. In my personal opinion, it’s really fun and engaging. There are a bunch of maps with a bunch of gamemodes. Gameplay is mostly skill based and competitive. I did of course find myself getting a bit frustrated sometimes, but that’s the case with any game.Features:-Good singleplayer and bots-Workshop support-Drops and crafting system-Cards and achievementsNegatives:-lag. A lot.			"

								Robot Roller Robot Derby Disco DodgeballWriting this on patch .371 Game is alot of fun, especially with friends. I've played this game for awhole lot of time and to me it just never gets old. Game is worth the price and if you got three friends the four pack is also worth it, thats what I bought. Keep in mind this game is in early access and there are some latency bugs but thats about it.  These problems arn't game breaking at all and probobly will be fixed at some point in the future. This game has the potential to grow into the next big game, the game that all the streamers play and the one thats always on the front page of steam. I met and spoke with the creator of this game at 2014's PAX East, although we didn't speak for awhile he seemed to be a very dedicated man who would do anything to see this game florish.10/10			"

												I wrote a horrible review of this game quite a long time ago and took it down within a few days. I have since installed it on a different computer and runs beautifully with no hiccups or any kind of lag. Originally I had reviewed it on my not-really-that-good-to-begin-with 2007 macbook pro, but have since tried it on my mid level gaming PC. On the mac it was terrible controls were so laggy even on the menu that I couldn't play. On the PC it ran very smoothly and all-in-all was a great little FPS. Two (in my opinion) cons to watch out for though are the fact that NO ONE is playing multiplayer, and that I really think the fact you need brakes to begin with is unescescarily complicating the controls			"

												Get this game with some friends and I guarantee you guys are going to have fun. It's dodgeball with a twist - you're a robot on a unicycle. Use boosts, ramps, and powerups to gain an advantage over your opponents and coordinate with your team to capture/complete the objectives. The art style and music work together to create a very memorable experience, whether you like real dodgeball or not.  Be sure to play the tutorial.  Bonus video:

												This game, I don't know what to say. Not only is it a lot funner than actual dodgeball, it also has a bunch of different gamemodes to help customize the experience and change it a bit. I also love that there is online and local multiplayer. Personally I don't play too much online but I love the local muliplayer so I can play this game with my friends. And adding the workshop was great too. In fact, my favorite gamemode is from the workshop! So, it's just a really fun experience! It has a bunch of different modes, gear to customize your robot. Settings to edit each mode. Both online and local multiplayer. An arcade mode, and so much more! This is a lot to come out of an 8 dollar game. I'd probably buy it if it was 30 dollars! It just has so much content in it and of course, it's very fun to play. Easy 10/10. I will be playing this for quite a long time.			"

								Nothing feels so satisfying as doing a 360 spin mid-air and hitting your friend in the face with a dodgeball.  Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is a great example of multiplayer arena games just being so dang fun.  It strikes a great balance between skill and chaos.  The disco part of this game gives it so much personality.  Music is used extremely well to keep the game exciting and fast paced.    Visuals keep improving, but the unique neon lights and dance club feeling are great.  As an Early Access game, it continually gets updates and improvements.  The dev is quite active in the game and any sites about the game.  You might even play him in a match!  I bought this much earlier and it has only improved from then.  However the only downside is that player base can be somewhat small.  This isn't a major problem because of AI but also because you're only in a room with 6-12 other people.  I recommend the 4-pack, or getting your friends to buy the game too.			"

												FUN! BEATS! DODGEBALL!Seriously, though. Why isn't this game out there being played? Pros:
 With friends, it could be a lotta fun! The soundtrack is fitting.  Gameplay is very engaging. It's both casual and competitive. It's like one of those party games like SpeedRunners. Controls are simple and easy. What the game will really put to the test are your reflexes and aiming.  It's not a game you'd play for hours, but it's definitely one which you'd play to simply have fun for a while. And you'll find yourself coming back to it once a while. It's constantly found in indie bundles, so there's no reason to buy it as a standalone from the store.Cons:
 The multiplayer is a ghost town. There's no one around to play with! What the hell?! Why isn't this game well-known?! This is the primary feature of the game, and it's almost completely dead. It should've added some retro stuff like synthwave. It's completely dubstep and all, which can get kinda boring for people with music taste like mine.   The price isn't worth it, considering how the multiplayer is almost dead. Keep an eye for it in giveaways or bundles, though.Verdict: I really liked the game. I got this from a bundle, and it's not worth the full price, since the multiplayer was what I looked forward to. And it's constantly packed in bundles, so if you see it, don't hesitate to redeem it. You should give it a try. It's definitely a worthy party game.			"

								Incredibly unique multiplayer game. Easy to learn, but with a high skill ceiling. The singleplayer is excellent as well, thanks to fairly smart AI. Beautiful yet simple art style, a kickin' soundtrack, and addicting gameplay makes this game a must play, especially with its low price.			"

												I wrote a horrible review of this game quite a long time ago and took it down within a few days. I have since installed it on a different computer and runs beautifully with no hiccups or any kind of lag. Originally I had reviewed it on my not-really-that-good-to-begin-with 2007 macbook pro, but have since tried it on my mid level gaming PC. On the mac it was terrible controls were so laggy even on the menu that I couldn't play. On the PC it ran very smoothly and all-in-all was a great little FPS. Two (in my opinion) cons to watch out for though are the fact that NO ONE is playing multiplayer, and that I really think the fact you need brakes to begin with is unescescarily complicating the controls			"

												good thing I got this game in the humble bundle. I always wanted to play it but if feels completly awkward. I assume because of bad netcode. You get hit by balls not even remotly aimed to your direction and it stutters all the time (or is it slowmotion?). Even with the fix to force d3d9 it still feels out of place. This game needs better netcode and a way better tutorial (what is grinding and how do I do it in this movement system?). I really can't recommend the game. There are even arenas which are just 1 room with nothing to hide where this game becomes completly random. I wanted this game to be as fluid as rocket league but it feels completly wrong.(Played some singleplayer matches with bots some matches against players and bots mixed and some matches with only players)			"

												Unfortunately despite the well easy mechanics for play and simplicity, the game lack of community is one that takes away from its well fun. Little community as is and half of the individuals care nothing for other players except themselfs or their own friends while leaving rooms an open thing. The game does NOT have language control and its job --or so it will or may say-- is it wants a strict and clean envoriment of players. Being told ""Kindly get the ♥♥♥♥ out."" Is not actually by definition of such.Secondly the issues is the game delay or lag is one that destroyes its multiplayer aspect. One moment you'll have a dodge ball to use, the second the ball SUDDENLY VANISHES cause the game delay or lag was supposed to give it to some one else. I've found despite my ping being the best or the worst, it has no valid communication between responsible lag handling and ruining stability of play cause of delay favortism.The third and final goes towards the AI. Yes, they are pleasently amazing. They jack up your skills. They enforce your ability of having to think, it is senseless fun to just throw the ball and get a hit or die.Why negative> Cause the AI are inhuman like *(Almost too Ai like) HOW, how are they TOO Ai like, their AI's!They will react almost with a 360 awareness of all times when the game forces you into a first person viewing. Idk. I can't see a player getting a ball, turning aorund with mid throw, then turning back around in just the same instant of motion with out flaw killing you. It's as if they knew on the dot where your at.> That's not a human possible thing to have happen. Not with out second hand guessing or pre-planning. These Ai's, have none of that.The game is sensless fun and I advise any one getting it to at least understand the negative probability you may encounter and over look it. I however, am slapping a no on this one.			"

												Yes, it's a good game, but all these people who say there are no cons are completely fooling themselves. The multiplayer lag situation is totally out of control, and what's worse is that you can't even see ping in-game. At any given time there are maybe a couple hundred people online, and the consequent lag means the entire catching mechanic is worthless: You will never, without extraordinary luck, catch a ball, because their client will register a hit before you even see them throw.

												Wow.I thought this looked pretty fun when I watched Markiplier play it, but I was not prepared for the exhilaration this disco party had to offer.The title frankly couldn't be a better summary of the game itself; you're an acrobatic, rollerblade-wheeled robot playing a (team) game of free-range dodgeball in the most visually and audibly intense club ever concieved. Though you can adjust the graphical output, it'd be good to note that this game is probably not for people with rapid color change and light sensitivity, because every surface in each of the (I don't even know how many) stages is lined with neon. If that doesn't bother you and your video card is functioning well, then buckle in for this techno and bass adreneline rave.The gameplay is similar to an FPS, except that the fast-paced mechanics and ""small"" arena size render camping impossible, and instead of slowly lugging your limited stock of guns & ammo that you have to keep stock of and try to be covert with, you just grab any of of the dozen glowing orbs off the ground next to you and throw it. It's apparent that months upon months worth of time was put into the tweaking of the physics and controls, because I would say that from the jumping to the boosting to the seemingly excessive sliding when trying to stop, all the slight calibrations are built to this game's exact specifications. A great job is done of raising a fun and competitive air of tension that inspires to pick up a ball and peg your opponent straight back to their starting gate before they can do it to you.It also seems to me that much time was spent on the polish of this game, seeing as after playing for non-stop for multiple hours, I only encountered one or two minor bugs, and that was just a matter of my router acting up.This game is incredibly smooth and unexpectedly action packed; fun is just a bi-product that you can't help but get out of it.Like FPSs?Good at FPSs?Like dodgeball?Good at dodgeball?Do you like music you can feel the beat of from five rooms away?If you answered yes of no to any or all of the questions, ignore the questions you were just asked and buy yourself a couple hundred tickets to the Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball.PS: Happy 2am.PSS: I slightly shredded my throat yelling at...kinda eveything on screen, during the 3 hours I was playing today.

												A damn great game to play with friends! I've had many laughs, and angry moments playing this game. I wouldn't say it's worth buying for $10 per copy, but if it's on sale I would definitely recommend this game! The soundtrack is absolutely amazing, very upbeat and hypes you up for an intense dodgeball game.The slippery controls make for goofy plays, and I'd say that's a positive! Props to Erik for making an amazing game!			"

												i5 4570;  Asus GTX 770; 2x4gb ddr3; Win10Purchased as a bundle $5.00 CAD; Bundle Stars, Indie Legends 5 (8 games).This game plays out like Unreal, Quake, Rune and the other arena-type fps games.  Use turbo-boost to jump, slide and grab the ball before your opponent and either throw it at them or use it to score (ala basketball).Kill streaks, combos, and strobing lights and bumping techo music.Plays flawless and is fast enough to keep you and 3 friends entertained for a few hours maybe longer.  I like how it plays as ""robots on scooters"", so jumping and timing is needed, but the game is arcade enough to be lenient.  You can tweek the game substatially (no gravity, big heads, infinite speedboost etc etc ETC).Simple.  Plays fast.  Lenient.  Bumping techno beats.  Happy faces, sunglasses, and hats.			"

												This is one of the most satisfying 'shooters' i have played. Unfortunately the community is pretty much dead, with usually no more than 10 people online at a time. If you like the idea of the game it's still worth picking up at around £3 as the Bots are decent and the arcade mode is solid, with plenty of interesting upgrades.			"

												Saw this game on sale for a cheap two bucks and thought to myself ""what's the worst that could happen?"". Apparently not  very much because this game is simply amazing. Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is a crazy name for a crazy game that's crazy fun!Pros: Fast paced action-packed arena insta-gib shooter; the pace at which this game plays is incredibly fast and will get your heart pumping. Rewarding mechanics; favoring client actions over those of the server. If you see a hit on your screen, it's a hit. Beautifully optimized; my computer is a complete potato and almost every map easily warrants me a happy 50-60 FPS. Fun to play with friends; start up a private match with a couple friends and have a blast. Or plug in a few controllers and engage in split-screen multiplayer. Unbelievably friendly community; in other multiplayer shooters the most interaction from other players is getting cussed out for 10 minutes. In this game everyone is incredibly welcoming and won't hesitate to strike up a conversation about whatever. People simply laugh off a lucky shot, or give you kudos for something spectacular rather than calling you a cheater, or other expletive. Light hearted concept makes it a great family title; if you're interested in playing with the family, this is a great multiplayer title to do so. I mean, come on. It's dodgeball. It's just a damned blast to play. It's hard to be mad at a game like this. Just enough edge to make it feel competitive, but just enough fun to keep you from being salty. The perfect balance.Cons: Sometimes the servers are a bit empty. It's not horrible, but isn't optimal either. I hate to judge a game by the amount of players it has, but sometimes it's a neccecary evil. Occasional bugs here and there, but this is to be expected from an indie game. The developer makes up for it with lightning-fast responses to bug reports on the forums. Looks like he reads every one as well. I have to play devil's advocate a bit with this one. The aforementioned hit registration can be a blessing, it feels great on your end, making sure every hit counts, but when playing against someone with a poor connection it can feel like a curse. A ball that flies way past you might hit you, or you might get hit even if you duck behind cover. There is no perfect system and this game has it at a balance where it's about as good as it can get. Just one of the pitfalls of online gaming. You're not playing it. What a con to a wonderful game! It's only $10 bucks for this spectacular title, and even better on sale. Why not give it a try? If you hate every moment of it Steam allows you to refund a game as long as you haven't played more than two hours, so there's hardly anything to lose. "

												So. I honestly like the game. But there are some things that I very much don't like. 1st, lag. When I first ran the game, it was incredibly laged. I couldn't even move in the game. I needed advice from my friend mr199racer to fix it. I think this is a major turn off for gamers. I wouldn't spend the time to fix it. But I still wanted to give the game a chance. Yes, it is fun and enjoyable. But really whats so special? Yeah you can play basketball, and deathmatch etc. But the game should be more custom. Make a new thing Erik! Make a new game with things called asdfghj I don't know! Just somehting we hav'nt hear about unlike basletball! Please. Please. Please! I rate this game 6/10. Sorry but thats realistic. I don't know if you should buy this game or not. I'm gave it a chance and they turned me down. This doesn't mean that Disco Dodgeball 2 wwon't be better. I will play it and give it a chance. I do though think that it's a little simplistic. I do see good things commign up from this game, and I do see a future. And I see this game going  a good bit farther in its lifetime. Good luck, Erik!			"

The only thing that wasn't perfect was the server's, because they're sometimes a little laggy, but one who loves this game can get over it easily.			"
