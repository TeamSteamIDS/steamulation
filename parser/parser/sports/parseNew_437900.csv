												""Team Fortress 2 - The most fun you can have online"" (quote by PC Gamer)Then we got Party Jousting, which can be described as The most fun you can have offline, playing with your friends.Party Jousting is a local multiplayer game where you control pets and battle your friends to death. Requirements:-Low PC.-Keyboard with at least two working buttons (Also, 'Enter' and 'Escape' are ++)-A free to play Steam account.-A Friend (you need to own at least one. It is too bad that nowdays you can't buy one legally, because most Steam user doesn't have friends)Graphic:Pixel Art graphic with high-polished pixelated pigs and ducks.Gameplay:You can control a pet, shoot your enemies, jump, collect coins... all with only one button.Storyline:You are a little pig named ""Bacon"". Evil developer named Fabian Viking trapped you in a cage with a duck, a sheep and a flying fish. He forces you all to battle to death and only one of you who kill others will be released and free. But, the evil psychopath Fabian also put obstacles that can kill you once you make a collosion with them. Also, he is helping some of the pets by giving them laser guns and koppa troppa shells from Mario Cart.			"

												Have you ever decided, after logging in, that you honestly dont really feal like applying yourself to anything cranial WHATSOVER nor do you intend on expending any effort or have any inspiration to do anything further from randomly stabbing one, (1), singular key in the vain hope it will do something productive or possibly entertain you beyond your wildest fantasies?Yes?I have the game for you.Party Jousting, creating as a fun little project and released initially on the pornographically named yet unfortunately not inclined, XBOX, has arrived on the Steam platform. This homage to the original coin op JOUST side view multiplay possibly first ever true PvP (platform?) game is a wonderfully addictive bit of clever that will absorb you for those 5-10 minutes you dont really have the energy nor inclination for anything else.One of those brain absorbing-login-and-not-really-wanna-do-much-but-wanna-do-someinthg games that has some clever depth and capacity to be used as a quickie or a new addiction to skill growth.Mad hilarious multi-player action that you simply have to try to believe its fun meter. Download it now!!!*** And now with a beta test option of a ""Silly Little RTS""! Right click on the installed game in your Steam Library, select Properties, Click the Beta tab on the top right and enter password ""stupidpassword"".			"

												It's like Flappy Bird and Joust (Atari/Arcade) had a meth baby. I played this on xbox live arcade a few years ago, this version seems to work pretty much the same. Touch the floor, walls, or ceiling- or get bopped on the head by another player -- and you lose a heart. Lose all your hearts and you're out. We tested it with up to 7 players and it gets very, very hard the more players you add. Well, not exactly hard- just freakin insane. Simple manic fun, and for free. There's some DLC but it seems reasonably priced (I guess) and I don't really think it's necessary to have some fun with this. This isn't the greatest game, but don't write it off as a generic Flappy Bird clone.			"

												When Flappy Bird meets multiplayer.When you realise you can control multiple characters at once.When you make your Left side brain vs your Right side brain.When you master using 4 characters in one session and not let any of them die for 30 seconds.When you try to find out which is your dominant finger. When you have alot of friends over at your house, but only one pc.When you realise your fingers are your only friends.You have no friends.10/10 best singleplayer game. Would be even more fun if I had real friends.			"

												This is what Flappy Bird would have looked like if it was permanently fixed on death match with multi-players, the title was simplicity at its best while remaining a blast to play at parties.The game play consist of two or more players controlling their characters with a single button press, while the duration of your press dictates the height of which you fly. Sounds simple? Well, did I mention that you also have to avoid spike traps, other players, along with the dreaded borders of doom?It gets more hectic with the more players you have, which is a good thing, especially when you have friends over for a bout. Even if you are the type that’s forever alone, you can have an awesome battle between your left hand and right hand, in which my right hand always win.Slight warning though if you’re planning on using a single keyboard. Unless you have a mechanical keyboard with some specialised drivers, it is not likely to register more than four key presses at the same time. So I would recommend a controller or two on the side to even out the players on each input device.The DLC packs are not required in any way, but they do add more characters and hats, it won’t hurt to buy some if you happen to like the game and support the developer.

												A funny game. It would fit better as a browser-game; it's definitely designed to be played in very short sessions, just to kill  time. I wouldn't see myself playing it for more than 7 minutes; however, I will surely play it often. Surely, the upcoming update will bring much to the table. We'll see then if this game deserves more attention.Note: I've only been playing it on 2 players mode; it's probably very different with more friends, as a party game.			"

												Party Jousting is a nifty free to play game that is a using a single button to flap.  It worked, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.  It is only multiplayer on your on computer so if you have alot of people at your computer you really can play this. You also can play yourself with 2 keys.  Sort of Funny game also.    Has textless controls. Try it, you might like it.

												Party Jousting is like multiplayer flappy bird, you bounce back and forth each click trying to avoid obstacles or hit power ups, the last player alive wins. Each player has a few hearts so they can be hit more than once. If you get a ton of people playing it gets pretty crazy. Currently there is ONLY local multiplayer, so Party Jousting seems like the odd couch play game on PC. I have to say I like it even if its some of the most simple multiplayer ever.			"

The game does have some violence, children beware.			"

												If you are looking for a way to make your keyboard greasy, this is the way to do it. Invite 15 people to put their hands on your keyboard so that you can make small characters jump into the air while trying to hit other players to the ground. Very enjoyable for 2-6 minutes. The game does have some violence, children beware.			"

												This game is epic. You can choose between a bunch of animals, and then you fight to the death. Super simple, super fun. I just wish that there were more stages and power ups. However, since the game is constantly getting updated this could easily be added in the future. If you have money then I suggest that you get one of the DLCs because...A. If you get the Hat DLC then you can look LIKE A BOSS (not the Jacksepticeye kind, but the sunglasses kind).B. If you get the Bling DLC then you get Beta acsess to new modes.			"

												Very fun once you get 3 or more players the nice part is that people who dont play video games can get the hang of it pretty quick. I like bringing this game to school so when were done with work we get alot of students playing but i wish their was more powerups because theyre only 2. Maybe add a chest that you can jump on to get different items like swords flamethrowers shotguns etc, but have this chest be optional.			"

												This game is relatively simple, and is great fun to bring to school and play with other people. That in mind, there is no truly single player version right now, but you can play multiple characters at once. I've personally played with 6 people in total, but we put all of the local 16 characters on the screen and saw how long it lasted. Despite the simple mechanics, it turns out to be very complex to truly master, and I'm still finding new features. Wonderful game!			"
