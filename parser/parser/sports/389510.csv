												It's like they took the religious influence and malware out of The Zoo Race, put the animals into karts and trapped them in a 2D world where they are doomed to race forever.Online Multiplayer doesn't seem to work though. However, this would be a great game for kids to play and look at. Having split screen controls on one keyboard is a nice move.Unfortunately, it's not for me. Kart handling is all over the place, and it all feels....wrong.As for the movie section, well, I dare not venture near it. I saw a lion doing a pose in one of the thumbnails so that was enough to peak my fear of this game.Here is some gameplay.

												A masterpiece, that breaks the self imposed barriers of gaming narrative and ensnares the player with intelligent gameplay and brilliant A.I. Anyone wanting to tackle the same themes will have to be compared to Paul bird's work. Paul Bird has proven itself again as one of the most accomplished development teams in the world. With ""Wild Animal Racing"" they have given us a consistent and interesting world that is supported by practically all of its game mechanics. From the rich complex racing system to the sublime sound design, this game immerses the player in one of the most visceral plots in this generation. Wild Animal Racing is a really different game, mixing traditional adventure, survival, action, stealth and constant exploration. The resources are most important. The best graphics on PC are back in the hands of Paul Bird, also the atmosphere, and six unforgettable characters. Simply overwhelming. Wild Animal Racing is by far one of the greatest peices of art ever created, and it was a whispered reminder that great games can do more than impress with sheer complecity and breadth, they can also draw is closer to them as to engage with our humanity. 10/10 absolutly perfect			"

												This game is TERRIBLE! I really cannot understand why all the positive reviews. Even if we consider newer players that never had contact with Mario Kart series or any game of this genre its horrible by all means.Graphics are ugly and look like a PC game from more than 10 years ago , or maybe a 3DO / PS1 era game?Controls are very bad too , very easy to suddenly turn 90 degrees and get stuck. If you bump into another car you are sent into a random direction at full speed.Balancing is terrible, Basically impossible to have any sort of handicap ( positive or negative ). You get ahead of the opponents, they run faster than you. They get ahead of you , you catch them quickly.So gameplay resumes to driving with very bad and irritating controls ALWAYS with multiple opponents cars nearby , which will inevitably bump into you and send you in a random direction - if going into a random direction doesnt happen spontaneously.

												This. game. is.. AWESOME. A must play for any serious gamer: casual gamers and casual gamers alike.But how do you know it is a great game?:- No adjustable volume settings (or settings overall)?: Check- Next gen graphics? Check- Random collision that makes you bump and brake in the middle of the road? Check- Downloadable contect done within literally 2 seconds so you know it is a great game? Check       This game proves again that you don't need lots of gigabytes of download for a great game. That is just bloatware.       You can have fun in literally 2 seconds of downloading this game: what more do you want?!I have played this game for a full 37 minutes and have drank about 37 litres of bleach.. 9/11 would play again.

												This amazing and unforgettable game inspired classics such as F-Zero, Mario Kart, and The Legend of Zelda. Zoom and rip your way at a roaring 5MPH as the same amazing and unforgettable 12 second song loop repeats throughout each and unforgettable track such as ""Roads"" and the unforgettable ""Magical"" the neverending ""Rally"" and of course ""World Tour"" which takes you to 5 entire locations!With graphics that put Witcher 3 to shame and mechanics that make Mario Kart look like child's play, Wild Animal Racing is definitely the GOAT, Undertale was made by one person, Toby Fox? He didn't even put his name on the title screen because he was so ashamed of how bad his game was in comparison to Paul Bird's blatant and original masterpiece.If you have not yet already, pick up this absolutely amazing game, with almost 30 minutes of gameplay for 4 dollars? You won't want to miss it.			"

												Every morning i used to wake up, get dressed, eat some toast, brush my teeth and go to work. All the while there was something missing from my life, an empty void that was eating away at me. I had to find something to fill this void, a new exciting job perhaps? No. A brand new car? No. A stunning super model wife that would let me ♥♥♥♥ her ♥♥♥♥ every day? No. What filled this void was Wild Animal Racing. My life is no longer a dull boring pile of steamed ♥♥♥♥ with little chucks of regret and disappointment filling it. NEVER AGAIN! My life will never be the same I am a new man I have a purpose in this world, to be the greatest W.A.R player this world has ever seen! My dream starts now, I may have lost my job because I never turned up. I may have lost my home because i didnt pay the rent. I maybe living behind a Tesco in Staines, eating day old yum yums and steak slices from the near by Greggs. My friends and family may have disowned me and written me out of their wills.I may wake up in the middle of the night from the same reccuring nightmare of a hippo and zebra scissoring while a feminist lioness eats her own ♥♥♥♥♥, I start to masturbate furiously to the wild furry sex I'm witnessing before a rhino made from denim charges at me with a raging boner. I run as fast as i can in the opposite direction only to be faced with an elephant snorting a 5 meter line of cocaine while a satanic giraffe is slicing open the bodys of the lesbian hippo and zebra while the lioness blames men for what has transpired. I wake up in a cold sweat shaking, with only a dirty crack pipe to soothe me.All in all great game, really enjoyed it. Would recommend 10/10			"

												I have many years of experience in gaming under my belt and I have to say this is no doubt one of the best games I have ever played. The concept is one that has not been ravaged and violated by various gaming companies and is also a story of tension and emotions rather than run-and-gun. Decisions have consequences and you need to take your time as well as make quick decisions, if that makes sense. After a few days in-game you start to feel for your characters and develop various bonds with them; you rely on them for various tasks and you will start to worry taking them into more dangerous areas. When they die, you will break down at your PC and go into a state of depression unlike anything you've ever heard of. this game is your best friend; you hate it at times but always come back to it and apologise. For an emotional thrill ride filled with insane art and a story unlike any other, buy this game.			"

I was in the market for something that so elegantly captures the surealism that is animals racing each other. I tried many other games but none of them can compare to Wild Animal Racing. Believe it or not it was actually Jesus himself who recommended this game to me, and this game has made me an overall better human bein. I finnaly made amens with my dying mother and hugged my father for the first time after I shed a single tear from the sheer beauty this game just emits. I have already started mass producing posters and I plan to distribute them shortly. After just under an hour of playing this game I feel I have transscended above human-form and become a higher intelecual. I hope this game brings you as much joy because it has changed my life in unimaginalble ways. I will continue to be a fan forever and God be with us all...			"

												The War of 1812 was a military conflict that lasted from June 18, 1812 to February 18, 1815, fought by the United States of America against Great Britain, its North American colonies, and its North American Indian allies. Historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right, but Europeans sometimes see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars, as it was caused by issues related to that war (especially the Continental System). By the war's end in early 1815 the key issues had been resolved and peace came with no boundary changes.The United States declared war for several reasons, including trade restrictions brought about by the British war with France, the impressment of as many as 10,000 American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy,[5] British support for Native American tribes fighting American settlers on the frontier, outrage over insults to national honor during the Chesapeake–Leopard Affair, and possible American interest in annexing British territory.[6] The primary British war goal was to defend their North American colonies, although they also hoped to set up a neutral Indian buffer state in the Midwest.The war was fought in three theatres. First, at sea, warships and privateers of each side attacked the other's merchant ships, while the British blockaded the Atlantic coast of the United States and mounted large raids in the later stages of the war. Second, land and naval battles were fought on the U.S.–Canadian frontier. Third, large-scale battles were fought in the Southern United States and Gulf Coast. At the end of the war, both sides signed and ratified the Treaty of Ghent and, in accordance with the treaty, returned occupied land, prisoners of war and captured ships (though neither side returned the other's warships due to frequent re-commissioning upon capture) to its pre-war owner and resumed friendly trade relations without restriction.With the majority of its land and naval forces tied down in Europe fighting the Napoleonic Wars, the British used a predominantly defensive strategy in the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada. Early victories over poorly-led U.S. armies, such as in the Battle of Queenston Heights, demonstrated that the conquest of the Canadas would prove more difficult than anticipated. Despite this, the U.S. was able to inflict serious defeats on Britain's Native American allies, ending the prospect of an Indian confederacy and an independent Native American state in the Midwest under British sponsorship. U.S. forces were also able to make several gains and score victories on the Canadian frontier; taking control of Lake Erie in 1813, seizing western parts of Upper Canada. However, a large-scale U.S. attempt to capture Montreal was repulsed in November 1813. Despite the major U.S. victory at Chippawa on July 5, 1814, serious U.S. attempts to fully conquer Upper Canada were ultimately abandoned following the bloody Battle of Lundy's Lane on July 25, 1814. The U.S. then fell back roughly 30 km (19 mi) from Lundy's Lane to Fort Erie, where they withstood a siege for several months. The British eventually withdrew, but as winter set in, the Americans demolished the fort and fell back across the Niagara.In April 1814, with the defeat of Napoleon, the British adopted a more aggressive strategy, sending larger invasion armies and tightening their naval blockade. However, with the end of the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, both governments were eager for a return to normality and peace negotiations began in Ghent in August 1814. In the Deep South, General Andrew Jackson destroyed the military strength of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. In September 1814, the British won the Battle of Hampden, allowing them to occupy eastern Maine, and the British victory at the Battle of Bladensburg in August 1814 allowed them to capture and burn Washington, D.C. They were repulsed, however, in an attempt to take Baltimore and Fort Bowyer, and during their assault at Fayal. An American victory in September 1814 at the Battle of Plattsburgh repulsed the British invasions of New York, which, along with pressure from merchants on the British government, prompted British diplomats to drop their demands at Ghent for an independent native buffer state and territorial claims that London previously sought. Given that it took six weeks for ships to cross the Atlantic, news of the peace treaty did not arrive before the British suffered a major defeat at New Orleans in January 1815.[7]In the United States, late victories over invading British armies at the battles of Plattsburg, Baltimore (inspiring the United States national anthem, ""The Star-Spangled Banner"") and New Orleans produced a sense of euphoria over a ""second war of independence"" against Britain.[8][9] The war ended on a high note for Americans, winning the final engagements of the war and bringing an ""Era of Good Feelings"" in which partisan animosity nearly vanished in the face of strengthened American nationalism. The war was also a major turning point in the development of the U.S. military. The poor performance of several U.S. militia units, particularly during the 1812–13 invasions of Canada and the 1814 defence of Washington, convinced the U.S. government of the need to move away from its Revolutionary-era reliance on militia and focus on creating a more professional regular force. Spain was involved in fighting in Florida but was not an official belligerent; some Spanish forces fought alongside the British during the Occupation of Pensacola. The U.S. took permanent ownership of Spain's Mobile District.In Upper and Lower Canada, British and local Canadian militia victories over invading U.S. armies became iconic and promoted the development of a distinct Canadian identity, which included strong loyalty to Britain. Today, particularly in Ontario, memory of the war retains its significance, because the defeat of the invasions ensured that the Canadas would remain part of the British Empire, rather than be annexed by the United States. In Canada, numerous ceremonies took place in 2012 to commemorate the war, offer historical lessons and celebrate 200 years of peace across the border.[10] The conflict has not been commemorated on nearly the same level in the modern-day United States, though it is still taught as an important part of early American history,[11] and Dolley Madison's and Andrew Jackson's respective roles in the war are especially emphasized.[12][13] The war is scarcely remembered in Britain, being heavily overshadowed by the much larger Napoleonic Wars occurring in Europe.

												Wow. That’s all I have to say after playing this game. Despite being colorful, simple, and having a tacky soundtrack, this game really made me weep. It’s just so beautiful, and dark at the same time.The story is about a group of wild animals going through hard times during the Cold War. They are all close, so they decide to unite together to make enough income to support their families by joining an international racing competition. Their friendship, compassion, and familial relationships all are affected by the glory, the fortune, and the fame of becoming a Wild Animal Racer. What started as a straightforward method to make extra money for the other wild animals in the savannah, started going down in a spiral of competitiveness, drugs, backstabbing, and money. The choices you have to make in this game really impact the story, and often I couldn’t control myself: I would start weeping at the computer, experiencing the hardship the characters are going through. The gameplay is truly immersive. I really don’t know what to feel after finishing it, it was almost as if I lost a child. That’s how emotionally scarring it was. Despite all the pain this game put me through, it is beautiful, and really showcases how human (or in this case animal) relationship works, and pushes these characters to the limit. This game is definitely worth the price tag for the impact it creates. After playing Wild Animal Racing, you will become a different person.			"

I would be hard pressed to find an actual thing I didnt enjoy about this masterpiece of the age. Every time you race you gain points which can be used to unlock movies. These movies have touched me on a spiritual level, when the Giraffe discovered the monolith I felt the tears welling up in my eyes as butterflies danced in my stomach.

												In Wild animal racing’s first moments you break free from metal restraints with your bare hands before smashing a demon’s head in against the edge of a stone table. As primary mission statements go, few games are so startlingly direct, but Wild animal racing revels in the simplicity of its ultra violence. This latest game from revered studio id Software takes much from the timeless 1993 original - its frantic bloodshed being the most immediately noticeable - but the Wild animal racing of 2016 also goes the distance to achieve surprise greatness of its own.Its exemplary gunplay is distilled into a gloriously short feedback loop that gets exponentially more satisfying. New Wild animal racing feels much faster than its iconic forebear, and after a brief introduction it continues to dial up the action without giving pause. By midway through its lengthy campaign, those first few fights feel like child’s play. By the game’s final quarter, you’ll be frequently amazed by the devastating onslaught that Wild animal racing delivers so consistently. It’s a wonderful progression of madness that never stops for breath.Wild animal racingThe premise is simple: you shoot demons. The new trick is to shoot demons until they stagger before moving in for a Glory Kill - a contextual finisher that sees the faceless Wild animal racing Marine breaking, tearing, smashing, ripping, sawing and eviscerating his foes to death. Killing in this way results in a colourful shower of health and ammo packs - vital in a game without regenerating health and where your primary interaction with its world is shooting until there’s nothing left to shoot.It’s a flawless slice of game design - easy enough to master, fast enough to be unintrusive, graphic enough to feel empowering, and intrinsic enough to survival for you to keep coming back for more and more and more. Id’s designers know this, and make a marked point of giving you very little else to concentrate on, or care about, as you progress.The inimitable Wild animal racing Marine doesn’t care either - his indifference communicated through a series of mute physical expressions. As UAC facility boss Samuel Hayden explains the importance of some research, Wild animal racing Marine smashes it to pieces before Hayden can even finish. When he’s shown vital information on a holo-screen, he pushes it aside to get on with the killing. The intention is clear: Wild animal racing’s small cast of supporting characters are merely talking signposts to propel you from one location to the next.Wild animal racingBut what locations they are. Hopping between a ravaged research base on Mars and the burning depths of Hell, Wild animal racing’s locations could be called derivative. Its sci-fi base is all pristine metal and crisp lighting, while the underworld is fire and brimstone. This isn’t new to games by any stretch, but Wild animal racing goes a long way to selling its hellscapes far better than any game before it.Part of this comes from some great art direction, but mostly from some astounding technical flourishes. Wild animal racing is incredibly detailed, especially on high-end PCs, and whether you’re fighting through a flaming foundry, an AI core cooled to absolute zero, or the corpse infested wastes of Hell itself, it’s distractingly pretty. Infrequent shifts from the game’s near constant reddish tinge feel memorable, but you’re always ready to get back to its blood soaked corridors. Consider as well that it runs at a faultless 60fps, and id should be commended for the performance it delivers on all platforms.As soon as you pick up a shotgun, sidelining the game’s pistol within the first two minutes, Wild animal racing starts proper. From there, it continues to introduce new weapons at pitch perfect pace so that you’re always playing with something new and exciting; an assault rifle, a rocket launcher, a super shotgun, a chaingun, the iconic and unashamedly named Big ♥♥♥♥ing Gun, and even more in between. Then there’s the chainsaw - rather than serve as a standard melee weapon it operates as a one-hit kill device that relies on a finite fuel source. The bigger the demon you want to kill, the more fuel it uses, so the chainsaw’s gruesome flesh-ripping is saved only for the direst of straits.Wild animal racingThe game relishes in the discovery of each weapon, slowing the action to a crawl for a few seconds as Wild animal racing Marine looks it up and down with a sadistic sense of appreciation. As your arsenal expands, switching between guns with your radial menu quickly becomes second nature. You learn to move around that menu as effortlessly as the Marine moves around the world; every design consideration is beyond precise, providing perfect balance to the ensuing chaos.That chaos is without doubt the game’s crowning achievement. Wild animal racing’s demons are varied and grotesque - dangerous on their own, but positively lethal in groups. The only way to win is to move faster, shoot quicker and be better. Pumping a Hell Knight full of shotgun shells, raining plasma orbs down on a group of Possessed, or unleashing a devastating Gauss Cannon blast on a staggered Revenant, Wild animal racing creates a ballet of bloody murder that requires constant thought and unending movement to keep up. The level design encourages - almost forces - mobility at all times, and while the entire game could essentially be summed up as a series of multi layered arenas connected by thin, linear corridors, Wild animal racing never suffers from this. Despite an unashamed focus on self-aware stupidity and uber gore, Wild animal racing is remarkably smart and dynamic throughout.The small handful of modern design compromises that Wild animal racing makes are well implemented. The most noticeable - upgrades for your weapons - are by far the biggest shakeup to the Wild animal racing formula. The assault rifle gets a scope and a missile barrage, the shotgun gets a burst mode and a grenade launcher, the rocket launcher gets a homing upgrade and a remote detonator, and so on. Each upgrade can itself be upgraded by using the skill points earned from killing enemies. The result is a set of unique guns that are as deep as they are diverse.Wild animal racing’s bombastic cavalcade of a campaign is its centrepiece, but its accompanying multiplayer provides a wanton aside that never quite reaches the dizzying heights of its offline counterpart. It’s just as frenetic, fast-paced and explosive, borrowing the verticality of id’s other shooter, Quake. Ironically, its biggest problem - that it doesn’t boast the longevity that it needs to survive against its contemporaries - is also what makes it so refreshing in the short term.There were no doubts that Wild animal racing would play fast, look stunning, or be gory; the surprise is that Wild animal racing is as relevant, smart and self-aware as it is; merging old ideas with new ones; injecting its near-flawless shooter mechanics into a campaign that’s impeccably refined, hilariously dumb and fiendishly moreish. In an overcrowded genre that’s hellbent on one-upping itself in a slew of increasingly tepid iterations, Wild animal racing’s multi-faceted personality is praiseworthy. After almost 25-years, the series finally escapes its precursor’s shadow, once and for all.			"

												The absolute best game for 4 euros. Physics are out of this world and its eerily similiar to real life driving. Multiplayer is fun and optimized, giving butter smooth frames in it. This game should cost alot more so im extremely happy to get it for lower before price rises to 60€. 12/10			"

												I have tried a lot of different racing games, but none compare the Wild Animal Racing.Handling:The most important thing in a racing game is how the car handles. I could not be more satisfied with how the cars handled. Where a lot of other games fall short, is that all their cars handle the same. If I where to play WAR with a blindfold, I would never be in doubt about which animal I was driving as.Graphics:It is amazing how a game, which was released all the way back in march 2016, still competes well with todays standards.Story: It was very good.

												I must say, for the limited amount of time that I have played, that this game is the greatest game of the century. The animation is some of the cleanest and smoothest I have ever seen.

												This is by far the most effective way to cure the most unfortunate diseases known to mankind: Cancer, crippling depression, HIV, and the worst of them all, erectile dysfunction. In a research conducted by Harvard Medical, 200 patients were forced to play this game for 57 hours. By the end of the session, each and every patient was cured. I, myself, have suffered from osteoperosis. Playing this game for 30 minutes has eliminated my joint pain, which allows me to finally go outside. However,  this is not very significant because I will not leave my computer screen. Wild Animal Racing is by far the best girft God has ever given humanity. I ask everyone: Parents, doctors, lawyers, teachers, and prostitues, please purchase this game and force all of your loved one to play it.			"

												Better love story than Twilight. Best FPS Shooter of its century, with outstanding plot line. Graphics grab you and contribute to the realistic seriousness of the constant struggle of life the game focuses on. It feels almost as if you are apart of the game itself. Fantastic and diverse soundtrack, that honestly no game can compare to. This intense racer through various historical monuments and child-reliving scenerios is beyond properly describable wording to fully explain how unimaginably great the game truly is.Please don't make a sequel...

 According to all known lawsof aviation, there is no way a beeshould be able to fly. Its wings are too small to getits fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't carewhat humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow!Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry?- Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening?- I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your fatherpaid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate.We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz.- Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.- Bye! Barry, I told you,stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam.- Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel?- A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school,three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I tooka day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry.- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie?- Yeah. - You going to the funeral?- No, I'm not going. Everybody knows,sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel.Such a hothead. I guess he could havejust gotten out of the way. I love this incorporatingan amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp...under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men.- We are! - Bee-men.- Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oitygraduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your careerat Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennasinside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like?- A little scary. Welcome to Honex,a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee,have worked your whole life to get to the point where youcan work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant PollenJocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected,scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctivegolden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot.- She's my cousin! - She is?- Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right.- At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspectof bee existence. These bees are stress-testinga new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes?- Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement,the Krelman. - What does that do?- Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs aresmall ones. But bees know that every small job,if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the jobyou pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life?I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees,as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?""How can you say that? One job forever?That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only haveto make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could theynever have told us that? Why would you question anything?We're bees. We're the most perfectlyfunctioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe thingswork a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you knowwhat I'm talking about. Please clear the gate.Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!- Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's likeoutside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks!- Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters!You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were.- I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knowswhere, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a PollenJock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollenthan you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol.Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing itand the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies?Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys.- Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerousbeing a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned meagainst a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat,and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my!- I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today,wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patchsix miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh?- Barry! A puddle jump for us,but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am.- You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy?Are you bee enough? I might be. It all dependson what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices.- But you only get one. Do you ever get boreddoing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you justmove it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm.It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad,the more I think about it, maybe the honey fieldjust isn't right for me. You were thinking of what,making balloon animals? That's a bad jobfor a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not surehe wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes.- I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're goinginto honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer?- No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now.I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Geta gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today!- Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobswill be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available?- Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations!Step to the side. - What'd you get?- Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first?- No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open,not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman?- Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See?He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

												It's been more than 15 years since the dawn of the Wild Animal Racing franchise on PC and the series is still going strong. Indeed, since its inception Wild has become a household name, seeing six iterations, over 10,000 tracks, and spawning millions upon millions of players worldwide. Every version brings something subtly different to the table, and everyone seems to have a favorite amidst a franchise that never quite changes, but never really stays the same from game to game. Ask players which characters they prefer, what levels top the list, and which items need to stay or go, and you'll get as many diverse responses are there are gamer types. And yet, most PC fans will agree that the Wild Animal Racing games are enjoyable single-player experiences and addictive multiplayer ones.Supposing you're new to the phenomenon -- hey, this is Steam after all; you might come from that coveted ""blue ocean"" corner -- Wild Animal Racing, like its predecessors, is a pick-up-and-play racer drenched in zoo themed characters and overrun with outlandish track designs. You can race against foes or engage them in vehicular battle -- not with guns, mind you, but spiked wheels and missles. This is a Steam game, remember. The concept may seem downright childish as you read about it, but the end experience is both charming and fun.Wild Animal Racing has never really been full-blown ""hardcore,"" and neither has it been wholly ""casual,"" a truth that Paul Bird has fully embraced this time around. Wild Animal Racing comes complete with three Grand Prix speed classes – 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc – with the expected unlockables after that. Each character fits distinctly in a race class, has specific light, medium, or heavy cars to choose from based on that class, and there's of course a healthy dose of local multiplayer via classic versus ad battle modes. If you grew up with Wild Animal Racing, you will not find the Steam iteration full of pioneering new play modes, which might prove disappointing for some. At the same time, though, Paul Birds's series was founded on a winning formula and we can therefore sympathize with any reluctance to break from it.Still, there are some welcomed additions. Not only does Wild Animal Racing for Steam ship with a Noose -- a shell that encapsulates the neck and makes the process of dying more believable -- but now there are bikes, Animal support both on and off the tracks, 32 total stages (half new, half classic), as well as a few new items thrown into the mix. It all feels and looks like Wild Animal Racing, mind you, but the extra bells and whistles are definitely recognizable But you knew that. The real question here is how exactly the game plays, what works and what doesn't, and whether or not you need to start sending hate mail to Paul Bird for screwing up your now-teenage baby.Overall, Wild Animal Racing is extremely rewarding and we take into account the Noose (yes, we just complimented a suicide tactic…), the inclusion of IR and non-IR supported menus, the seamless integration of console Animals, and never-ending laundry list of SteamConnect24 and Steam Wi-Fi Connection features, the continued support of traditional control schemes, the retro levels, and much more. For the thick-minded, Wild Animal Racing offers a seemingly never-ending amount of content. Some of it you'll love and some you won't want to play through a second time.For the first time ever on a Steam console, the online portion trumps the single-player offering, and we'll explain why. Both 50cc and 100cc races are fine in Grand Prix, though the exclusion of the Wild Animal Racing-like cooperative two player GP is a serious misstep in our opinion -- you can certainly go in and create your own GP competitions, but they work separately from the normal GP cup progression. Road Cup is a bit boring, World Toar starts to mix things up with some decent track design, Rally Cup really starts to take off with some superb levels and true innovation, and a Magical Cup that rounds things off with one of, if not the, best LSD trips  in franchise history.Overall, I give this game a 10/10f ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn			"

												This game is the reason god won't answer my prayers anymore.I was mentally scarred in two minutes. The next five, I frantically tried to uninstall it because I had been so broken by the game that I actually believed that the hippo was out to get me.This game, despite all the funny reviews, isn't funny. It is the most terrifying thing you'll ever see. Not even a sadist would wish this upon a masochist, that's how awful this will mess you up. Save yourself and send this to a friend, but never... Never buy it for yourself...			"

												Video game has enchanted me since I'm a little boy, and I thought I had seen everything until now. Until this. ""Wild Animal Racing"" raises the art of gaming to a new level ; it's a precious gem that can lead us to a quintessencial question : ""What is art ?"". Art may be this. Or, at least, ""Wild Animal Racing"" could be the perfect symbol of art feelings, of art power - I can feel the symbiosis. Pay attention, dear gamers : after having raced in there, you will never be able to race again. Mario Kart will just look like a rotten dump compared to this game. But hey, do you really need Mario when you have an elephant and a godblessing zebra ?			"

												Wild Animal Racing is kart race game develped by Paul Bird and released on the 2016.It is a very unque racier game, with amazing graphic, an art style of the interest, greatest control, and a various of fun, action-packed race track. You can race with computer, or five other friends, or with a isolated friend using the groundbreaker splitscreen mode.Scattred along the tracks are amazing items which give you points, and after collecting a lot them, you unlock intriguing video clips to watch.Also scattered along tracks are power ups that give you an edged over other, be it a immense hammer to knock someone out from the race, banana's peels to impede other progress, swords on wheels to slow enemies down, rocket launched to slow down those are ahead on you, or a bubble that protects you from dangers.Wild Animal Racing is phenomenal game, and delivers infinite pleasure!

												absolutely beautifulbefore this experience, my most favorite game of all time was Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots. But honestly, this blows every game i've ever played in my life right out of the park. Stunning environments filled to the brim with details, it's like i'm really there. Gameplay that gets your heart pounding with action-packed powerups that don't actually work and also you have to click them to get them to work but only sometimes. there's also movies that you can purchase with ingame currency that you earn by playing this game and that takes ♥♥♥♥ing forever i dont even know why it's a feature. you can jump but it doesn't do anything. Paul Bird is a genius. This isn't just the greatest game of all time, this is art in it's most perfect form. It's also inspired by many masterpieces such as Steel Ball Run, Berserk, Sweeney Todd and my favorite movie, John Wick. 10/10,			"

												Fantastic racing simulation. Its a physics based game and the engine dynamics are comparable to that of battlefield 1. The speed at which this game moves at is absolutely exhilarating. Make sure you buy a new 1080 Ti because if you don't have one of this, you wont be able to run this bad boy. The characters have such deep personalities and the game allows you the ability to unlock incredible movies showcasing their vast and incredible histories. The game is beautifully made and really opens your eyes up to how hard indie developers work for a paycheque. Without this game, I don't know where I would be right now, probably in an alleyway having sex with a donut covered in crisco. This game saved my life.			"

												Honestly an underrated gem. Perhaps overlooked as just another Mario Kart styled racer, the satirical undertones as well as the immersive psychological experience which is meshed into the single player campaign makes this one of the most memorable experiences available on the Steam store as well as the biggest surprises it has to offer.

												I absolutely adore this game. It's so goofy and cute that you'd have to be a total scumbag to not find enjoyment in it. Wild Animal Racing has a commendable soundtrack and variety in tracks, and the unlockable movies are wildly imaginative. This game brings me back to when I was a little kid, when animals were the coolest thing ever. It's ethereal. Wild Animal Racing is truly a work of art, evidently made with a lot of heart.			"

												All jokes and memes aside, this is quite a fun game to pick up with a group of friends to have some laughs. Sure, it might feel like a literal acid overdose at points (2nd magical stage, I'm looking at you), but it's got its perks. Online multiplayer is perfect for internet friends, and splitscreen for LAN parties will be useful for when the competitive scene begins. The music is pretty sweet, and unlockables keep you coming back for more. If there were to be any further developments coming to this game, I'd really like to see a public server browser so that I could play with anybody from around the world. If you're looking for some fairly-priced fun, pick up this game and gift it to your friends. You'll have a few laughs, guaranteed.			"

												Watch Out, Diddy Kong Racing!Wild Animal Racing has proven itself to be a masterpiece of it's time. Featuring an all star cast of not three, not four, not seven, but SIX wacky (and wild) animals to play as.Upon starting the game, the absolute load of options of adventure to choose from is quite stunning! ""Single Player, Split Screen, Multiplayer, Movies, Language Select!"" It's all here!Race around tracks the likes of which you've never seen! Race around Egypt! Iceland! A race track! Cloud Land! Once you're done tuning your skills in Singleplayer, it's time to face off against a friend in SPLITSCREEN!But whats that I hear you cry? You don't have any local friends to play against? Well don't worry ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥er, this ♥♥♥♥♥ has ONLINE MULTIPLAYER!Just invite up to six of your friends who have copies of this game (which I'm sure you have lots of) and race to your hearts content!But maybe all of this high octane action has tuckered you out, maybe you're in the mood to watch something...?WELL GUESS WHAT? This game has MOVIES! Just spend your hard earned racing points in the ""Movies"" menu and have a jolly 'ole watch! There's enough hilarious and entertaining movies in there for everyone!This game is absolutely drowning in charm, style, and wildness and I would recommend this stunning example of gaming nirvana for anyone looking for a gay old time.""It's the Citizen Kane of wild animal go-karting simulators.""

												I was totally prepared to slag off this game, but I'm convinced that Paul Bird is a sort of Andy Kaufman type character, making intentionally-unintentionally hilarious animal games about animals driving go-karts, getting stuck in world geometry, trolling other animals by leaving a trail of banana peels that other animals will drive into and crash out, and dancing to a really bad kareoke version of Darude's Sandstorm. It's like a G-rated version of Tristan Farnon's old comic series Leisuretown. God bless you, Paul. You keep doing you.			"

												Wild Animal Racing is the first game of the Wild Animal Series, A series well known for its challenging gameplay and excellent world design. The first thing you see when you launch the game is  a splash screen of the games title with the main character (The Giraffe) in his signature red car. you also see ""made by Paul Bird"" underneath the title, a subtle hint to the secret bird boss later in the game.You can play single player with the expertly programmed AI or if that isnt a challenge enough you can take your chances and face off against some of the worlds best Wild Animal Racing fans (You might even be able to race me #1) Or if you are feeling a bit more intimate you can invite a hot date over for some split screen couch co-op action, Something that will ensure your date goes home thoroughly pleased.There are 6 characters to choose from all representing the animal kingdom (sorry humans this isnt a game for your kind) each of them has thier own unique racing style and gameplay abilities, the shining examples being the lions ability to blend in with the sand on the desert levels to give him that extra edge or the rhinoceros' secret ability to ram other racers with his horn to knock them wildly of course.The soundtrack is amazing and has become an instant classic in my home, I have already made the beautifuly orchestrated underwater theme my ringtone. The wonderfly orchestrated soundtrack compliments the gameplay in ways ive never seen before, It slowly builds up for the first few laps then breaks into an almighty crescendo upon the final stretch filling the player with a sense of awe and wonder at the fsat paced action.Overall this game is a master piece of game design and is not for the faint of heart, if you love high octane blood fueled animal racing action then this game is a must buy for your christmas list.I give this game 10 stars of of ten it is excellent i give you a standing ovation Paul Bird! BRAVO! BRAVO! PAUL BIRD! BRAVO!			"

The soundtrack, gameplay, everything is just amazing and how i expected it. This was worth my money and i have no regrets returning it after finishing the game in 40 minutes. If you are into FPS such as COD and Battlefield then this is definitly the game for you. The intense competitive game mode is amazing. The 4 different races offer a huge variety of maps and music. My personal favorite is the one where they give you LSD and you trip some major balls. All in all this was definitly worth my money and I will always remember the wonderful times i had with my one friend i convinced to buy this game. It was fun while it lasted Wild Animal Racing, you will live on in our hearts forever.			"

												The story of how this game was created:One night, Mario Kart was drunk as ♥♥♥♥ with his other racing buddies. There, they dared him to get busy with the next racing game that came through the bar doors and this game was The Zoo Race. Mario Kart and The Zoo Race got busy at a cheap motel hotel and filled Zoo Race with his ""love."" Zoo Race got a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child in her and Mario Kart left to ♥♥♥♥ more racing games. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child became Wild Animal Racing, selling it's body for $4 a time.The End "

												Let’s cut to the chase: Wild Animal Racing is one of the best games ever, go get it immediately!Now if you want to know more, let’s expand it a bit then.The game is fun and really solid in every way, the controls and playability are well implemented and responsive.On the technical side, it has some really stunning and beautiful graphics and effects, the maps look gorgeous and Iceland, Holland, Underwater, Egypt , etc., are just amazing.The sea is what impressed me the most, IMO it’s over the top, it feels very realistic and when you drive near the shore you feel video games will never be the same again if a virtual sea can be this overwhelming. It really feels this game is taking PC gaming to its limits, so if you have a solid rig to run it then you will find here one of the best looking and most technically impressive games for PC ever. Having a system capable of running this beast on ultra-settings will make you think that all your hardware is being put to the test and that your investment was totally worth it.I’m very happy with this version, yes the PC version is awesome and everything is almost flawless. As a good sandbox this open world has literally tons of things to do, it feels huge!The racing mode is well developed and it has funny characters. The humor is satirical and politically incorrect (as it should be ). Gameplay wise, driving is well implemented, intuitive and feels natural.  And with so many types of animals, lion, hippo, rhino, ect it never feels repetitive or boring.On the sound department the effects are stunning and I love the soundtrack!, a lot of wild animal Racing songs now are part of my personal playlists. In general a lot of attention was given to every little detail. This is basically a masterpiece and a perfect game, simply one of the very best games there are for PC. Justice has been served for PC gamers and the wait was very much worth. I absolutely love it.So once again, if you don’t have it yet, what are you waiting for?, you should be playing it right now instead of being here reading this. "

												One of the best gaming experiences I've ever had in my entire life. Maybe it's not the characters, maybe it's not the gameplay. It's the world, so much to explore, loot, and see. I've literally spent hundreds of hours in this game, explored so much, and probably have only seen about half of what is offered here.

												Kevin James stars as Paul Blart, a Segway-mounted security guard at New Jersey's West Orange Pavilion Mall. Having repeatedly dropped out of the New Jersey State Troopers' academy test (low blood sugar makes him pass out without any notice), lonely single dad Paul takes his job too seriously and lives with his mom and daughter -- and he hasn't had a date in so long that they set up an online profile for him. After meeting lovely new kiosk owner Amy (Jayma Mays), Paul thinks she could be the one to look past his schlubby exterior to the sweet, courageous man inside. To prove himself to her, he stays in the mall to try and save her and a group of other hostages captured by a group of young criminals on the hunt for a huge identity-theft score.IS IT ANY GOOD?At first PAUL BLART: MALL COP just seems like another broad, brainless Adam Sandler-produced comedy aimed at teen and tween boys. But as the plot thickens, James' teddy-bear of a protagonist actually begins to grow on the audience. Despite the many fat jokes (which are thankfully not aimed at Raini Rodriguez, the cute, chubby actress who plays Blart's daughter Maya), there's none of the raunch that's defined Sandler's signature brand of humor. Blart doesn't make apologies for who he is -- a food-loving, mustachioed, unfashionable man who loves his job and his mother and daughter and would risk his life to save any innocent mall shopper.The physical comedy is surprisingly well executed, with James pratfalling with the ease and grace of Chevy Chase or Buster Keaton. Mays is like the second coming of Anna Faris, and the acrobatic, skateboarding crew of criminals put on an entertaining cat-and-mouse chase around the mall. The mall, it should be noted, deserves its own credit, since the movie prominently plugs many a store -- particularly an extended scene in Victoria's Secret. So, yes, this is a broad, silly comedy filled with consumer brands -- but it also has, embodied in its brave buffoon of Paul Blart, heart.all and all not a bad game - 9.5/10			"

Then this master piece came. It's a very touching story about being an animal racing for freedom from the zoo. (watching the movies you unlock shows that)I'll give this game a solid 10/10 for the deep story telling, fun game play, and the ability to save marriages.			"

												I've played a few racing/rally games, including DiRT 3, PURE, Forza Motorsport 3, Gran Turismo 3 & 4, Super Mariokart, Mariokart DS, Mariokart Wii, Mariokart 7 and Mariokart 8, but this game beats them all. Mind-blowing graphics, easy-to-learn controls and unique characters. Absolute 10 out of 10.			"

												Legitimately like this game. Gave me some fun moments with friends. For a few quid it's worth it, especially if you are looking for some to just have fun with that doesn't take itself too seriously. Definitely looking forward to what Paul does next be it DLC, sequel or something completely new.			"

												Masterpiecie! If the best gameplay among all of racing games wasn't enough, the game also offers us an incredible visual expierence! And music... It's impossible to explain it, you have to play it! And the characters! Every single one is deep, they all have their own problems which they have to deal with, and they're so likeable when we uncover their motivations! 11/7, game of the year Sorry Volvo, 1/2Life can hide in the corner, this game rules the Steam			"
