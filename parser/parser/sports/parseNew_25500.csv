												If you like cricket, and you want it on steam, this is pretty much the only option there is. it feels a bit stiff, but it functions fine otherwise. it could still do with some fine tuning, particularly the mechanics for bowling, which seem a bit too easy. Still, it works, and is moderately fun.I did also play the demo for this so, despite the low playtime on my library now, i have actually tried it out properly.			"

												Hands down one of the best games in the last ten years. Beautiful scenery not unlike Crysis, voice acting on par with the Metal Gear Solid series, and powerful, intricate cricket gameplay to round it out into the only true 10/10 game I have played in a long, long time. There is no reason why you should not own Cricket Revolution at this point.			"

												If you want to play Cricket on Steam you're basically stuck with this, but it's hard to justify even at a low cost.  The gameplay is both incredibly simplistic (fielding is all automatic and bowling is very toned-down) and needlessly complex (many, many ways to swing, each with their own button combination.)  There's not a whole lot to do but just play games with the teams they provide you (no customization or anything like that) so even if you can get past the controls, there's not much to do.  Worst yet, the game isn't supported anymore and you can't create accounts for it, so setting up multiplayer requires using external programs like Hamachi.A bunch of my friends bought the game for each other as gag gifts, and even the people who liked cricket couldn't find much to enjoy.  The game's probably not even be worth it for $2.99.			"

												Are you looking for a decent cheap cricket gaming experience without being able to fine a single server anywhere even if its just to play with your dirty bogan scum of a mate online? Thaaaaaan Cricket revloution is the game for youuu! Special features include shotty batting controls, dodgy and glitchy AI for the times when you dont want to enjoy the games you bought and best of all an absolute guarentee of you finding a single server in Australia! What's that kids? You'd rather enjoy playing backyard cricket with that stranger across the street who constantly offers you a free vasectomy than play an online game of cricket revolution? This games got you covered! ""A definite MUST BUY if you hate the internet and your friends!"" ~ Nelson ""The man"" mandela, 2016			"

												There are many flaws with this game which ruin it and make it rage enducing to play. Batting even on the easiest setting is not only counter-intuitive, but it is almost impossible.To time the shot correctly it seems you have to press the buttons around the time the bowler lets go of the ball: not as the ball is in flight and about to pitch. The problem with this is it is almost impossible to know when the game starts timing you as to when you should press your shot selection! Press too early and it does not register as the bowler is still classed as running up, or press too late when the ball is in flight and about 1/3 of the way down the pitch (i.e. when you would actually start making your shot in real life) and the batter misses and gets out. No where is there a timing gauge (like the EA cricket games have) which would let you get a sense of when to time the ball. In the practice nets there are criptic written proms which say 'too late' or 'too early', but This does not help as the speed of bowling naturally varies from ball to ball so it does not let you get an idea of when you should have pressed the buttons. There is no system to tell you how well you timed something in the matches at all, and as the ball often appears to sail through the bat without making contact it is impossible to know what you did wrong!At least once I have been out LBW when the ball did appear not hit the batter but all the fielders appeal as if it did, and obviously the umpire just triggers you. I can only assume the reason there is no 'action replays' in this game is because this would highlight these frustrating incidents. Like most games of this type, the bowling is dull and the AI batters can play insane physics defying shots which defeat the point of setting fielders.  Avoid this game.   "

												After an hour or so of playing against AI, I've had enough. AI batsmen hitting yorkers for six or just late cutting them for four, fielders throwing the ball so slowly the batsmen can run two while the ball is in the air. Not sure about the adrenaline thing, all I know is AI bowler comes on, bowls two wides and ends up with full adrenaline, I bowl an over and the gauge doesn't move.			"

												This is the worst baseball game I have ever played. The only teams are commonwealth countries and the bat is all flat and♥♥♥♥♥♥ Also the umpire wears a stupid hat which implies he's from Texas.The Cricket Revolution will not be televised.			"

												I was eager to get this game because it sounded pretty cool. The name ""Cricket Revolution"" made me think it'd be like A Bug's Life, except with crickets and more hardcore. When I began playing the game, it instead looked like a sports game of sorts. I didn't really get what it had to do with crickets, but I started a new game anyway. It put me in some stadium and had me play some stupid version of baseball where you roll the baseball on the ground and hit it with a paddle, kinda like golf but baseball. I decided to go with it, because I thought maybe in the middle of the game the crickets would revolt and set the story for the game. I played the match out to the very end and didn't see a single damn cricket. This title is incredibly misleading, and Valve refused to give me my money back. Avoid my mistake; don't buy this game.

												In addition to being a sports game on PC which is generally an unwise idea, this is about a sport that nobody on Earth gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥about except the English and colonies of the English. If I knew even the slightest thing about cricket beyond ""it's not actually baseball"" I could surely give a much more educated opinion on this game. My uneducated opinion is that it sucks. ♥♥♥♥ you wazzit			"
