												I agree with everyone else posted. It looks pretty real physics and design.			"

												Pretty neat really, the environment looks great with authentic reflections and shadows. The basket ball has a characteristic weight to it, but it's a little off from real to me, the bounce and ball physics come accross a little too heavy and the bounce slightly under inflated.This demonstration would be an amazing starter to be into made into a complete multiplayer basketall game.

												I have to say this game is very realistic. You can tell it's not your typical pixelated VR game.It's very hard to even score in this game and the bouncing could be a lot better.That having said I spent a good few minutes playing this game! Sadly it's not something you could play for hours. However if it would be possible to make this game multiplayer? In the sense that friends of yours can join in and have fun. I wasn't exactly talking about random online people. Overall I really enjoyed this game. Definitely worth a try!8/10 + 0.1 for being a free game.			"

												It's free, It's fun, It will give you paint transfers on your controllers if you are tall.Seriously, it's a fun game, but make sure that you can extent your arm completely (with controller), and not scrape your ceiling.Other than that, the physics are great and it's a free and fun mini-game			"

												Im not rating this under the impression that its free, Im judging by the fact if I would play this in my free time.....and I absolutely wont.Pros:+ nice graphics+ runs smooth+ can teleport to any spotCons:- you can respawn the ball, but it will always appear on the ground, meaning you have to bend over each time to pick up the basketball, I dont do that even in real basketball, I just give the ball a little shove with my foot- the physics of throwing dont feel good, the ball feels way too light- the 30 second throwing game is pointless, as you constantly have to bend over to get the ball from the ground loosing so much timeWell you get what you pay for. In terms of throwing hoops, there are several better basketball games, like VR Hoops or even Modbox has better ball physics. They cost money but are much more worth your time.			"
