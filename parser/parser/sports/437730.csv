Early Access Review
Roadclub: League Racing shows a lot of promise and it's already fun and with a great amount of content. I'm very surprised to see a day one Early Acces game already very polished and robust. There's a good variety of tracks (nine tracks right now), challenging AI, excellent music (really, really good, wish I could buy the soundtrack too) and great interface. The controls are all rebindable, there's four difficulty levels to choose from, and you can choose to race at any time of the day and with different conditions, like rain, snow, mist and strong wind. Also, there's local multiplayer! Local multiplayer for a top down racing game on Steam is a very rare thing, and this feature by itself is enough to guarantee a purchase. The gameplay is challenging enough and it's cool that the AI upgrades its cars on Career Mode - it makes the game always exciting. But don't be scared, if they become too strong, you can always earn money by playing custom matches on any track and with a different difficulty setting. Also, it's worth mentioning that this is clearly a game made with dedication and love (since 2004! Look at the store page for more info). The devs are always listening to your suggestions and feedback. Join the community! This game can be even better with more players and a lot of ideas.TL;DR - Already nice game with a promising future			"

+ The gameplay is fairly fun, about what you would expect. It's a top-down perspective racing game with pretty simple controls and a boost meter. Slow down at turns, avoid walls, and stay on the track to win. + Visually the game looks pretty nice with various environments and weather effects.+ Great soundtrackThis game is in Early Access so these are subject to change- Only 9 tracks- Nothing really innovative or interesting about this game compared to others in the genre. - Overall the game is pretty repetitive, and gets old pretty quick.

Early Access Review
								So far so good, the game has great potential and the Devs are very responsive to ideas.A top down racing game geared more towards the simulation aspect than a simple blast round a track.You can dive into a race or start a career, limited cash and a small garage for your racers.Do you drag one off the scrap heap or drive one of the fore court?Options to upgrade and repair cash willing too.Handling depends on the car you buy, but is good.A variety of tracks with the promis of more to come, and hopefully a track desgner.Graphics and sounf do the job.I have enjoyed my time in the game so far and look forward to more updates.As I mentioned earlier Devs have responded quickly to concerns I have had improving a few visual aspects to ensure I could enjoy things better despite my visual impairment.Also tweaked AI at lower levels.  Kudos to them,I certainly can't argue with the price either.More than happy with my purchase. "

Early Access Review
								Fun and fast paced old school top down racer. Veichle handling and physics are very engaging for this kind of racing game. I would not call it a top down simulator, but its way less arcady then many similar titles. My favorit part of the game is the online leaderboards and local co-op. Coming from Dirt Rally i really enjoy the aspect of racing against the clock and comparing times set by other players.For a early access title it runs well and the developers are active on the steam forums listening to feedback. It feels like you have a chance to influence the further development of the game. If you like these kind of racing games i recomend that you give Roadclub league racing a shot, i see a lot of potential for this early access game.			"

								You can judge me all you want, but top-down racing is the best racing in my book! Game looks good and does what it sets to do, although I would love to mess around with more arcade-y gameplay modes in the future.			"

								Pure racing in the old school, top down fashion. Reminds me of the old classics RC Pro Am on the NES and Rock'n Rol Racing on the SNES / Megadrive, but with real physics and crispy new graphics including weather effects like fog!  "

								The game is great the only problem is the handling, other then that its great. But why play it, if the handling is going to make you not have a chance. When this gets fixed I will change my rating, the time I put is enough to know the handling is not good.			"

								Very fun game, been playing it since I was a beta tester. Ignore the lack of hours, I've played it a lot more offline.			"
