												Beautifully made game, really fun with good bit of progression, leveling to get to different mountains and buying gear. Played a goood bit of beta.Game runs really smooth, optimised well and haven't seen any bugs yet.If you're anyway interested in snowboarding/skiing, or just scenery this is an awesome game, only downside is the cost, it's abit ""Steep"" har har!

												Brendan Caldwell is an idiot (RockPaperShotgun).He has totally missed the point, this isn't an arcade style SSX. It is attempting to capture the real world feeling of exploration and finding a unique line to shred in a realistic sim style physics based way.Any bad reveiws of this game are posted by non skiing/snowboarding players who assume holding forward the whole time is an accurate way to get down a mountain and timing in jumps is irrelevant.If you're having trouble with the controls, try going slower, the right stick is used to wash off speed, which im sure Brendan never touched unless his character was in the air.I don't post reviews but I felt I had an obligation to this amazing game to correct Brendans' crap effort.It is simply a joy to play and I couldn't recommend it highly enough to anyone who loves the snow.

												The game was quite fun, however I was quickly becomming bored after trying out each sport. I don't think the game is worth £40 however, since there is no way to play the game offline so if you are suddenly disconnected from the internet, the game will go to the home screen.The game looks great graphically and the animations and design on the map look great. But I find the mentioning of singleplayer on the store page to be quite misleading since singleplayer, to me often implies there is the ability to play offline without other people or an internet connection. Usually games that are only online multiplayer are much cheaper, but this game at full price is a bit much.I don't recommend buying this game at full price or if you have a bad internet connection, but maybe during a sale.

												I bought this game on the winter sale, for what I feel was a fair price. This game is a cross between EA's SKATE and SSX 3 (for the old PS2). Like SKATE, this game takes a serious approach to extreme sports, the tricks can be difficult to pull off and some of the 'lines' (read: levels) are a bit tough, but it is also rewarding. Like SSX3 you get to ski from the top of a gargantuan mountain range to the very bottom, without loading... Seriously no load. You can transport from one end of this insanely large mountain range to the other in a click of a button and it doesn't even load. Bam you're there, bam you're skiing, boarding, skydiving, whatever you want. Well worth the price I paid for it on sale.			"

												    So here i am completing a mission where i have to follow this ai, but at one point of the mission we have to climb a hill and jump off a cliff. At this point when we jump off i lose track of the ai and start flying my own way. As i am flying i see another player skiing down the mountain, so i fly towards him and belly flop into the snow. That is where my journey with Wamuel begins.    Wamuel and I after that meeting explored the vast mountains. We completed many missions together and discovered many new places, glitches, challenges, and made snow angels. But there was one challenge that would be the greatest of them all. Wamuel and I reached a mission and it told us to get the summit any way possible and the summit was like 5 mountains away (took around 45 minutes to get too). Wamuel would ski and I would use the snowboard. We glided across mountain ledges and climbed the mountains on foot. We parachuted across the gabs until eventually we made it to the summit. At the summit Wamuel and I saw the sunset and we knew what had to be done. We rode down the mountain we had once tried to reach. As we went down the mountain Wamuel split off never to be seen again. Wamuel will never be forgotten.   But on the flip note this game is great for anybody that likes sandboxes and appreciates sking/snowboarding. Many stories will come from this game that you create and you will meet new people on the summit from every path you choose (also the music is good). "

												Steep is a weird game. A love letter to exploring the picturesque Swiss Alps by way of extreme sports, it toes the line between realism and Red Bull guzzling, MTV goofiness. It's built for scale and spectacle, but digging deeper to actually play the game can feel like you're on a team of beta testers, sharing challenges you pulled out of your ♥♥♥ and turning a blind eye to the glaring glitches and rough edges. It suffers from an identity crisis; one minute you'll be paragliding peacefully above a glacier while your avatar narrates a somber diary of conquering the wilderness, fighting oxygen deprivation and dehydration. Then you'll be following a literal ghost rider through the mouths of Ubisoft's Raving Rabbids mascots or being lectured by a stereotypical New York agent for not hitting enough “sick” kickflips. Or a mountain will try to intimidate you, reciting some Robert Frost style poetry. Steep is best played with an open mind. A really open mind...   The game can be stunningly gorgeous; the scale of the mountain range is very impressive and boasts some of the most realistic looking representation of snow I've seen. The glittering of the sun off of fresh powder in particular is approaching levels of photorealism. The detail of your character is quite sharp as well, especially considering the vast amount of unlockable accessories available to outfit him/her in. Traversing the frozen environment also leaves convincing tracks as you sink into the drifts, climbing steep slopes to reach points of interest. An applaudable amount of work and artistry went into the snow, but some of the elements surrounding it look out of place. Rocky surfaces can look like smears painted with a broad brush, often visibly, hastily thrown together at artificially rough angles and clipping through each other. Trees and glaciers are carbon copies of each other, leading to stretches of boring, repeating terrain. But the large scale picture is the reason for playing, and these are the compromises of a completely open, load-free playground.   You have five modes of transport at your disposal: skiing, snowboarding, paragliding, wing gliding, and walking. Skiing and snowboarding are similar and the challenges that feature them are interchangeable. You have very simple controls with these two: steer with the left stick, the right stick cuts sharply, you hold and release jump to ollie, and from there you can spin and grab. For the most part, though, you're at the mercy of the mountain; it's incredibly difficult to make quick adjustments and it can be a struggle to get your avatar to do what you want to do without serious effort. You have no control over the camera, and that becomes an adversary; jamming to the right trying to hit a checkpoint can easily be undermined by a wild, uncontrollable swing or zoom because the game felt like it. You certainly don't have Tony Hawk/SSX levels of control, which is fine, but what's in Steep is better described as “loose” than simulation. After about twenty hours of playing I felt adjusted to the game's quirks, but more often than not trying to get your rider to generally perform something specific still comes down to trial and error, combating the controls, and a good amount of luck. You're provided with a G-meter that is supposed to track how much punishment you can take before you spill, but in practice the game just does what it wants; a ten second free fall onto solid rock might be okay, but hitting what appears to be a pebble may or may not send you into a knockout faceplant.   Wing gliding is the highlight. Flying inches above the ground, weaving around snow covered trees and sharp rocks is exhilarating and it controls responsively. Most of the challenges in the wing suit revolve around passing through rings and gives a serious Pilotwings vibe. Paragliding is more relaxed and is the preferred method for exploring the Alps, allowing you to cover large swaths of land and soak in the sights while you're at it. You're given a very generous updraft system: get close and kinda/sorta perpendicular to a mountainside and there will always be uplift, essentially allowing you to glide endlessly. I'm pretty sure that's not how wind works, but whatever. Walking is where you put one foot in front of the other to initiate locomotion, and while on foot you can use binoculars to spot drop zones and places of interest.   The scale and freeform exploration is great, but the “game” part of the game, the challenges, are all over the place. These events are scattered all over the mountains and they're generally races against the clock or score based affairs. They are categorized into Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulties, and you can earn bronze, silver, or gold medals depending on your performance, which awards XP to level up to unlock drop zones and currency to buy cosmetic items. The open nature of the game itself wrecks havoc with any scoring conventions; a single, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t trick pulled out of your ♥♥♥ can destroy a gold medal challenge in seconds. Alternatively, a glitchy camera can be a repeatable bane to finishing a race without ragdolling down a cliff face, and the difference between a gold medal or complete failure can either be a matter of minutes or seconds. There's very little consistency between which challenges will be a fun exercise in sharpening your skills or controller throwing frustration.   And that's Steep broadly speaking. It demands to be enjoyed with a relaxed demeanor and forgiving nature from a zoomed out perspective. If you can find that zen state it's one of the best extreme sports games that's released in years. Just don't look at it too closely.			"

												Steep is a gorgeous game.It's beautiful. Once you get past the admittedly repetitive and bland missions, poorly-voiced characters, and a story so shallow it has negative depth, Steep is a sandbox of exploration, tricks, badassery, beauty, and danger.As a note before we begin: Steep is not SSX. You won't find that level of ridiculous stunts here, and the game is not as forgiving. It is comparable to SSX, though, and if you liked SSX, Steep can still offer something to you.Of course, that's when it's at its most poetic. Naturally, the game fills a niche: if you don't like snowboarding, skiing, paragliding, or wingsuiting, you won't like this game, and even if you do, the price is, pardon the pun, rather steep.If you do like them, and the price isn't a problem, you next have to deal with the missions and, consequently, the voice acting. While some of the voices are alright, the grating radio personality and the bland ""boss"" voice are the most frequently heard and the least likeable. The best voices are, thankfully, those of the atheletes (snowboarders? they don't just snowboard).The missions themselves are pleasant at best and teeth-clenchingly frustrating at worst. While the game is difficult on its own, many of the missions are particularly hard, which is poorly-conveyed by the three-star rating system of difficulty. Adding to the problem is that you have to level up to gain access to Mont Blanc, the best mountain for generally having fun, and you have to go through the worst of the mountains to get to it.The ""story"" is as follows: you are a professional extreme sports person, you make money of footage and competitions, you are the best at them, go win and you will unlock more of the competitions. Of course, you shouldn't have expected a story, silly. However, the tone is inconsistent: some missions take themselves seriously like the Red Bull invitationals, but others act like you're on a Hellish game show like the missions of the Mountain of the Damned.The incredible beauty of the game is immediately apparent, though: as soon as you enter, you're dropped in on the mountain range to see the snow-covered hills and glittering snow itself. The graphics are wonderful, and the optimization is pretty solid (my thoughts on optimization are probably not the most reliable, as my rig is pretty high-end). Naturally, though, beauty is subjective, and if you don't like what you see in the screenshots, you won't like what you see in-game.The gameplay is where the game shines, though please read before downvoting because you had a hard time: the game takes some skill and practice. This isn't to say you're bad, this is to say you need to give it time, get used to and good at handling the controls, and note that the keyboard controls are much worse than controller, but the game is entirely playable with mouse and keyboard. Snowboarding and skiing handle mostly cleanly, though inconsistently: sometimes you get slung off to the side when cresting a hill at an awkward angle. The wingsuiting is fast and requires precision, but use the IJKL keys as a second directional pad to dodge and you can slip through gaps you wouldn't be able to before. The only place where the gameplay falls off is with two things: glitches and paragliding. The glitches are maddening at times: sometimes a jump your character landed cleanly and lightly on a steep slope will reduce their endurance gauge (that's the best I can call it) when they should have been fine, and the paragliding is murkily explained with tooltips that don't give any tips at all. The most helpful thing I discovered with paragliding: the stunts button is not just for stunts. It helps you move down in updrafts.Overall, Steep is a beautiful, clean-looking sandbox for high-speed skiing, snowboarding, and wingsuiting, and for leisurely hangtime in paragliding. It's a little unpolished, and you will encounter glitches - perhaps it's best compared to Skate 3 in that regard - but it's a fun, satisfying experience if you're looking for a more modern snowboarding game.TL;DR: Steep is flawed, but it's not bad: the repetitive missions are annoying, the voice acting grates, the keyboard controls are awkward, but once you get past all that and get better at the game, it's a winter wonderland made to be explored and shredded with solid, if slightly inconsistent, handling and beautiful graphics. Use the stunts mode for paragliding if you want to go down fast.			"

												When I was a child , SSX was one of my favorite games of all time. I had them all, and SSX Tricky made me have an epiphany: Snowboards are ♥♥♥♥ing sick. Shortly after I purchased a snowboard, and the rest is history. You can say that I love snowboarding just as much as I love video games, if not even more. So obviously, Snowboarding video games are a genre that I have played just about every ♥♥♥♥ing title that gravitates toward the extreme snowsports side. And I will say one thing: this is it. This is the one you've been waiting for, the one with a huge awesome mountain range to explore and ♥♥♥♥ around in to your heart's content. That's why SSX 3 had such a lasting impact on me, I spent more time in that game just riding around as I pleased because I loved it. Steep is very identical to it, you've got characters to select from with unique personalities, drop zones to unlock, and each mountain has it's own sort of weather effect or day/night restrictions to make it feel unique from the others. This is the kind of game where you can start at one single fixed point and play for an entire hour and not get bored because of how many places you can actually go/access from said point, and the wingsuit and paraglider are both much more fun methods of transportation than I had originally thought. And, there's lots to be done in this game.I'll leave you with this: we're all here cause we like games, but in the same sense that people who have no interest in motorsports will have no interest in racing games, I feel like this game is meant to be appreciated if you're either an enormous fan of wintersports or you ski/snowboard yourself. You'll get that 70 dollar value from this game If it's your thing. I know people with several hundreds of hours on Games like DiRT Rally and PoxNora, because for people like them it fills in a missing gap , a game that truly encapsulates something they love while hitting all the right notes.I've been waiting for a game like this, and while it may not be perfect (no jibs make me sad) it's definately more than I could ever have asked for from a snowboarding game.

												Ok. Let's break it down. - Good Graphics- Good Multiplayer- Good Mechanics, it feels good and it responds nicely. - Controller is highly preferable - On sale (currently)This game is a really good game if you're an adventurous person. I wouldn't buy it for $60. However, rn it's $30 which is a great deal. Before you buy this, keep this in mind. Steep is essentially this large mountain that you could do whatever you want on. Yes, it will get boring because you are basically doing the same thing over and over again and Yes, you will probably only have about 10-12 hours of actual entertainment. The environment look will grow old. I have a GTX 960M and I can run this game flawlessly on high/ultra graphics. Keyboard and Mouse isn't the best thing to use for this. Being completely honest. You will have way more fun with controller. You can move more accurately with controller as opposed to directly left and right. The wingsuit on keyboard is absolutely aids. You have to constantly hit the Down key (S key) just to remain in the sky. If you get close to ground, you get more points, however, it is more likely that you will get hit and KO'd.Snowboard is alright. You can pretty much do everything alright, but like I said earlier, a controller would be a lot better. Expect to fall on the snowboard a lot because its hard to control the G-force and the way you land on keyboard, for beginners atleast. The ski is basically a replica of the snowboard, however there is only a change in speed. All the movement and everything feels good and its responsive. I don't use the ski's that much so I really don't have a say although in the times i've tried it, those are what i've noticed.I find the parachute to be the easiest to control on keyboard. I prefer to be on the ground going fast on snowboard, but parachute is easy to control, its not that hard to use and you can get some great views from it. Good screenshot material. A WAY YOU CAN GET GOLD EDITION FEATURES:I've just recently found this out and it worked for me. The standard edition game was $30 and the Gold edition was $40 (on sale). I thought it was worth the extra $10 so I bought the Gold Edition, all the Gold Edition features were activated on my uplay account and everything. I had all the costumes, the season pass, the extra helicopter tickets, the extra steep points. I then refunded the Gold Edition and when I got my money back, I bought the Standard Edition. I re-launched the game and I still had all the Gold Edition features. Steam is responsible for launching the game, while uplay is responsible for all the features and in game purchases. Uplay doesn't know that you've changed editions or even refunded in the first place, they just think you're coming back to play.			"

Initial ThoughtsI played Steep in the Beta a few weeks back and was impressed by it then, I didn't play it a whole lot as I generally don't like burning myself out in beta's before the game is released due to progression getting reset etc. etc.I've been playing now for the past few hours and the game is excellent, there are still a few things that need sorting but it's well worth the price tag compared to some games that have come out this year.It's not just your generic snowboard racing game that many dismiss it as, you are free to do what you want, you can create your own challenges, play in a variety of ways (Currently there is skiing, snowboarding, wingsuit and paragliding with more coming soon) As one who enjoyed SSX at a younger age but since moved to playing more competitive games I am not usually attracted to these sorts of things anymore but the way the game is done is what makes it so unique, it caters for everyone so you can play it as casually or as competitive as you want, like I said above it's more than just a racing game on snow.G-Force Meter[Aids]-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10This could be in gameplay but deserves it's own section.This is basically a meter which goes up and if it goes too high you fall off but the game does not tell you how it works, what so ever.This felt gamebreaking in beta and still does in full release, I have noticed on multiple challenges now that start off at high speed leading towards a ramp if you hit a slight bump and get just a milisecond of air time the game gets confused and puts your g force meter borderline ""Falling off"" so when you do hit the ACTUAL jump your g-force stacks and stack and stacks and RIP goes your line.This seriously needs re-working and honestly is a massive dampener on what is an awesome game. Gameplay / Controls1-2-3-4-5-[6]-7-8-9-10When it comes to the gameplay / controls side of things I feel this is what really lets Steep down, on keyboard it can feel very out of control at times, you don't have the precision you need on certain challenges which can easily lead to frustration.It is playable on PC however without a controller (or I wouldn't have bought it in the first place) but if you really want to get the most out of it and get gold in everything / really challenge peoples scores then I do recommend you get a controller.Sadly in typical Ubisoft fashion it seems they catered for console first and PC was a bit of an after thought.Visuals1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-[9]-10It's gorgeous, hands down one of the best looking games of the year, my steam link arrived yesterday so I am quite looking forward to settling down on the sofa (once I get a controller) and enjoying this bad boy on my 50inch. It's hard to really talk about visuals really but if you look at any media of the game you can see for yourself, better than I can describe in words anyway.I've yet to see any graphical glitches.Dropped a point as at nightime the slopes can be insanley dark, but they're supposed to be, I am nit picking. Sound1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-[10]Loving the sound in the game, the music is very fitting and not intrusive, it makes enjoying the slopes relaxing and the challenges intense but get you pumped as you are hurtling down at breakneck speeds.Also noticed that each costume has different taunts, I have just unlocked the giraffe costume and if I press T I can make it squeek, pretty funny when zooming past someone with your long neck flopping about in the wind. Overall1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10Overall I can highly recommend this game, even if you have just a slight interest in snowboarding / snow sport games now or in the past you will find something to love in Steep. There is plenty of replayability and ""Holy sh*t"" moments, I find myself saving clips and playing about with the replay editor constantly.The community in game also seems very inviting, whilst I was chilling on top of a mountain I was constantly being invited by people wanting to ride together.There is plenty of content to unlock, loads of challenges and hidded secrets with plenty of progression.Loses points due to the horrible g-force meter and really requires a controller to enjoy it fully.Extras:How not to play Steep (Props to Cow for nailing that tree at full speed):http://plays.tv/video/5841698c477353e14d/autism-alertSnowman and replay testing:http://plays.tv/video/58413b4a300d61f3c8/snowman-lyfSlight odd bugs can still be found:http://plays.tv/video/58413844970975f869/sliiiiide-to-the-right-take-it-back-now-yall "

												I love snowboarding and this is my dream open world snowboarding game. Steep is a fantastic sports game in many ways. Its open world is vast, fun to explore, and filled with challenges to complete. The game plays greatThe controls are tight and responsive and it is satisfying as hell to pull off tricks and death defying feats in all the sports. Especially in the wingsuit. The audio is fantasticI love the sound of snow crunching and this game does it well. You also hear your gear hit different surfaces. I'm basically trying to say the game is an ear gasm. The music is also great. I listened to the Rock playlist and turned on copyrighted music. There are some good songs. They're also not obnoxiously loud. Songs stay quiet until you begin to snowboard, ski, etc. But I have some gripes. 1. The challenges are repetitive, mainly for snowboarding/skiing. The vast majority of challenges are doing tricks before you reach the finish line, and it doesn't play to Steep's strength of its environment. There are some cross-country challenges, where you have to reach a certain point in a given amount of time. These were my favorite because you get to explore the environment more and work your way around it rather than short jumping paths to do another flip or spin. There are also mountain missions that have you follow another rider, discover places, and more. They're fantastic and goofy at times. I found them more memorable than the races and trick challenges. 2. There is no custom character.You do get A LOT of clothing options, but you don't get to create your own custom rider. I found this odd because of the crazy amount of clothing items. Balaclavas are included too, thankfully. 3. The world feels unpopulated. This is a constant online game, and you will run into other players, but the actual map itself is devoid of life. I'd like to maybe see some NPC's Snowboarding, Skiing, Gliding, etc. Or maybe some avalanches? Wildlife? THERE'S ALSO NO FILTERING ON THE MAP WTF?!UPDATE 1: I'll update this review as I find some other things that may or may not bother me. Jumping: It's REALLY inconsistent. This is probably realistic, but in my honest opinion it's not fun to play. Nothing is more annoying than jumping, moving the left analog stick, or pushing a or d, and seeing your guy do nothing because you released the jump button a little too late or early depending on how the game feels. I understand that there is something to learn here: the right time to jump, but in all the hours I've put in I have yet to find a consistency in it.G-Meter:This is your regenerative health bar. If you land a trick poorly, fall from large heights, or land of rocks, etc. you lose this. The screen goes black and white and you want to avoid doing any tricks or jumping until it recharges (NO MATTER HOW SMOOTH AND SKILLFUL THE LANDING YOU WILL CRASH). It's horribly inconsistent. Sometimes you'll lose all your health on small things or lose nothing at all.It should also be mentioned that there are times when the physics will ♥♥♥♥ YOU. Sometimes if you hit a hill at an angle you'll be sling shot backwards or if you ""try again"" you may spawn in the ground. Season Pass: I rarely ever buy season passes, so I didn't look at it for this game. I did find out that there are some exclusive challenges and sports to it, such as sledding. I think it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and that it should be included in the nearly $100 base game. Just something to be aware of. For all I know the future DLC could be amazing, but I don't recommend buying it. This practice should not be supported.Update 2: While exploring the mountains, I noticed that they are a lot of towns and chair lifts. Sadly, you cannot interact with these. It would be awesome if you could ride the chair lifts, and for the towns to be hubs for players to sit at and possibly invite people to group up based on gameplay style (challenges, exploration, snowboarding, all sports, etc.)Despite my many issues I still can't help but love this game. I love the setting, the free roaming, the graphics, the audio, and the rush that it gives.			"

												A blend of arcade and realistic gameplay, with amaaaaaaaaaaaazing graphics.I put in 24 in the last 3 days and got Gold on nearly all challenges, and yet still have a bunch of unlocked locations left. The game world is huuuuuuuuge, so there's a bunch of variety. A bunch.Pros n Nos:+ Huge world+ Awesome customization (most things you unlock by getting Gold medals, other things you can buy for ingame points. To put it into perspective, jackets cost up to around 2800 and gloves 600, and at the moment I have around 220,000 points. So I can buy quiiiiite a few things. Remember to get your free stuff from Ubi rewards page (shift+f2 for Uplay overlay.).)+ Has both serious and funny moments, though probably more funny ones. Gnome hunt comes to mind, the phone call was hilarious, haha.+ Really good looking game, lets you get more immersed and take in the sights.+ All kinds of terrain, for all kinds of riding styles. But I think someone from the Dev team has a glacier fetish (there's a LOT of them).+ 8 playable characters, each with their own voice lines. So you can be the Dudebrah My Man Dude or the old Scandinavian (probably Swedish tbh from his accent) guy with a beard. Press T on keyboard to cheer and howl in a positive way, or press it twice to make either funny or mean remarks  when you want to insult your friends or that guy that faceplanted into a rock 3 times in a row.+ You don't die when you crash, so that's less annoying than SNOW where you die instantly. But you can still die if you take 100 G force, however that requires a super long fall straight down so it's mostly fine. The game is the most arcadey in this sense because you live through falls that would ♥♥♥♥ you up real good irl =P.+ You can control time of day and ambiance (cloudy, cloudless etc.), makes for some really cool shots and gameplay.+ Replay feature with cool effects, it's pretty good.+ Online gameplay that's smooth.+ 4 different cameras, tho realistically you'll only use either close third person or first person.+ You can put on an animal mask and make animal noises that are hilarious, bwahhhhhhhhhhhhh.+ Music effects when during a jump, falling and getting back up, and also different kinds of music for different kinds of events. Serene and calm game ambient when at the top of the main mountain, Blue Stahli when going down the steepest mountain at 120 km/h, F-F-F-F-Freestyler (rock the microphone) when in snow parks.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Always online, you can't even play solo without connecting to the servers. ♥♥♥♥ing sucks, dude.- Instanced but people usually disappear when they are 150m away from you, which SUCKS.- Annoying American that keeps calling you and talking about dumb stuff. Drinking game: take a shot everytime he says ""SOME SERIOUS AIR"". Have fun getting completely hammered.- Music once again. It's pretty varied, consisting of 40-50 tracks (my guess) of several genres. However, you can NOT add your own music, which isn't a problem when you can just mute and listen via Winamp or whatever you use. But if you want those sweet effects, then you're out of luck. Not a problem but would want this in the game real bad.- Another point about music, you cannot select more than 1 genre ingame playlist. It's either all of them or 1 of them. You cannot even select specific songs you (don't) want to listen to, which in my opinion should have been included in a game that wants to charge 56+ euros.(-) Price, but it's personal opinion. I don't believe in buying games costing more than 30 euros ever, good thing I got it as a gift.- A LOT of resistance, like a LOT, when riding ""against"" the slope, or parallel to it.- There's this INSANELY ANNOYING GRRRRR bug where if you're in the rider customization screen for either too long or you preview too many things (don't know exactly how this happen) suddenly it will seem like the drone flying next to your rider kicks up a bunch of snow, basically you can't see your rider at all cause they're a white sillhouette, and your fps will drop to 5 or so (I run on ultra at 60 fps, for comparison.). FIX PLEZ!- Game also freezes up and crashes (crashing doesn't happen often though, once or twice a day during my 8 hour sessions). Nice price value, bruh.Overall thoughts! Great game, you're gonna have fun (probably), ESPECIALLY if you play with friends. However you can always just meet up with random people on top of the mountain and ride with them =). The bad things do not outweigh the good things, so if you think you want it and it's at a good price, get it and enjoy. Fair to mention is that if you don't like free roam games then you might not play for as long a time as others, although there's plenty of challenges to keep you busy by going up the leaderboards and whatnot. I'd give the game a 8/10 on the softer side. Toodles.			"

												If you like Skate, or grew up with SSX, or just plain harbour some love for winter sports, you'll find this is a pleasant combination of the three, which looks gorgeous and runs smoothly.And which is not worth 60 bucks.Must-have buy when on sale, for 30 or below.			"

												I don't know what happened to Ubisoft lately but it looks like they decided to finally release proper games : Beautiful, well optimized and interesting. Keep up the good work guys.As for Steep, it might be one, if not the, of the most relaxing games i've played. The game is beautiful, the open world is huge. Sure, it has is problems like collisions glitches but free roaming around the mountains, discovering new spots, enjoying some rides or just riding while listening to the great OST feels just good.If you're looking for some SSX like game, pass your way, it's totally different. You won't manage to get some crazy tricks. But if you're patient enough, the trick system is good enough to have fun.PS : Devs, please add the possibility to remove the HUD.Edit : Devs added the possibility of removing the HUD <3			"

												How to enjoy Steep:1. Dont take this game seriously. This game is fun snowbox, not a hardcore simulator. Its simple, you have everything at the start of the game. Items change your badass look, bu not skill. ""Easy to learn, hard to master""2. Friendship. Grab your friend, or team up with the others, and explore, compete, laugh and share your happines. (i have played both solo and co op, and i have to say that the game plays diffrently in both cases, and doesnt loose its charm)3. Music is good, but yours is better. I personly love in game music, but nothing stops me from opening my YouTube/Spoty account and turn on my favorite music. 4. Chill. Just chill and enjoy the mountain. Enjoy every step, every fault, every tree that you have kissed, because if you fail once, you will never fail the same way again. 5. Passion. Man it feels good to nail this trail with golden medal! It has been a long time sins  i was so passionate about getting best score. And it feels so good. I guess last game that made me feel same way, was old Trackmania. Sins then non of those racing games gave me the same feeling. I will try, i will fail, but at the end i will allways succeed.6. Make your day.   Game offers lots of customization. From Go pro camera to spade on your back. No one look alike, be cool, play cool. Customization touches  not only cosmetic items, but also world as well. Switch from day to night, take your neon suit and slide down with some chill music in background while in go pro view. Trust me, thi is unforgetable. Use your creativity, create your own moments, create your own trails, create your own playstyle.As for me, i might not get 50 or even 20 hours on this game, but those that i have allready are inaf to say that i have spend my money well, because this game gave me experience that i wont forget for a long time. If award for most ""Chill game"" would exist, i would gladly offer Steep as a candidate.Now, lets grab some ""Red Bull"" and 360 no scope that ♥♥♥♥!			"

												Great graphics and optimization, plays well. But the price they're asking for and what they're providing simply doesnt translate to me. It's a fun little sport game but not worth the price.And is it just me that gets incredibly annoyed with these kind of games where the story/announcer is always suuuuper impressed by whatever simple tutorial thing I do and basically hailing me as a superstar or something. I remember this from some recent racing games and it's really silly. ""Oh look how amazing you are, you're gonna be the next big star with this sport, because you pressed <Space>!!!""Definitely worth it though if it's on some super cheap sale, afaik it's the best ""snow sports game"" you can get.

												This is a great game.The fact that there are 0 loading screens except for when you first boot the game blows my mind. You can pop anywhere you want at any time and you'll be there instantly. The map is massive and it's only going to get bigger with the FREE Alaska map dlc. Tons of customization from wacky costumes to serious snow gear. The controls take a little bit to get used to but once you get it, there's only room for improvement. The skill cap is ridiculously high. You can Spawn at the top of a mountain, make a line and then share that line with your friends as a challenge, race, best jump, etc. It has its glitches but no game breaking ones I've seen yet. Did I forget to mention the game is BEAUTIFUL? Everytime you do anything in this game it's screenshot worthy because of the beautiful Vistas. As someone who put 30 hours into the beta and 25 so far since release I highly recommend this to anyone looking for something new and fun.			"

												TL;DR: Wait till it goes on sale. The frustrations this game has outweighs its aesthetics and gameplay value.There are more ways to arrange a deck of cards than there are particles in the observable universe, but Solitaire nonetheless feels a bit ""samey"" after the first few trillion games.The same goes for the challenges. They're each unique, but they're all just ""go through the orange circle"". While it's quite a beautiful game, it isn't long before you'll get frustrated with most of the medium + hard challenges, requiring dozens if not hundreds of attempts before being able to complete some of the more agregious ones.The controls don't feel at all intuitive.Jumping with snowboards feels more like luck rather than skill, wing suits are frustrating in turns greater than 10 degrees, paragliders have an annoying ""wind"" mechanic where you'll end up rocketing skyward (usually when you least want it to happen).The G-force mechanic which serves as health in this game is a nuisance more than anything else. The mountain view. Oh god the mountain view. The camera will not stay at one particular zoom level. At all. If you want to check your place in the world briefly, or plant a flag to work your way towards through the monstrously proportioned game world, you have to sit through two overly long zoom-in and zoom-out animations.It'd certainly be worth your hard-earned money were it priced at a more reasonable $30-40, but $60 for a game you'll more than likely play for 3 or so hours before putting it down and leaving it to rot in your library is just too much. Buy food instead. You deserve it, you beautiful person.			"

												I've been a huge fan of snowboarding games since the original SSX and have played just about every Tony Hawk's Pro Skater game except the newest one. Overall at bottom.The Main Drawing Point The main drawing point to this game is being able to switch between sports at any given moment and having random players show up right next to you as you're playing. This game captures that perfectly. It's got that Journey feel to it where the players that you meet can have a huge impact on the gameplay itself. The Missions and Customizations These aspects of the game are well done. Certain clothing are locked behind missions or require steep cash to buy. Steep cash is rewarded for completing these missions as well and how much is determined on if you got bronze, silver or gold. These provide good incentive for players to have a goal in mind, but also to meet and group up with others who are also trying to complete those missions. Controls The controls are difficult to grasp and from experience are much more suited to a controller. Keyboard and Mouse are fantastic for FPS games where controllers don’t do so well. Controllers are much more suited for Sports games where keyboard and mouse aren't that great. Doing tricks in this game is one of the main reasons why controllers are just about a must have for Steep. The way you do tricks, put simply, is very much like Skate 3 and fits a controller.Turn off trick safety if you aren't able to do tricks the way you want. It prevents you from doing a trick if you won't be able to land it in time. (Personally prefer it off)Overall Overall I'd give this game an 8.5/10 Fantastic.The game provides a scratch to those who've been itching for a fantastic snow sports game. It's good looking, well optimized and plays well, but way way WAY better if you have a controller. While there are missions, the bulk of fun comes from meeting and grouping up with other players and making the game your own. If you prefer solo play then you just won't get much out of this game. The controls can be difficult at first but with some patience you can master it easily. While the game is everything I've been wanting it obviously isn't going to be friendly for everyone and has some gameplay qwerks that can be off putting to some causing it to receive my score.			"

												Lower the price to something reasonable, and I'll probably pick this game up again in the future. As it sits, it feels a little unpolished and unfinished for an $80(cad) game. It's alright as it sits, but even on sale, this game just isn't worth the asking price.Ubi, drop this to $20. You'll get more than four times the players, and it's actually reasonable at that price.			"

												A fantastic game for anybody who likes exploration and chill games. Some of the mechanics are a bit clunky at the moment but it's nothing the devs can't fix. Based on the map size of the Alps (and considering the Alaska map that will get released later with this game), I can say that the amount of routes/slopes that you can find is seemingly endless. If you are looking for replayability, this is definitely your game!I enjoyed the hell out of the beta and I can't wait to explore what else is out there. I have faith that the developers will continue to add new content to help improve the game over time. "

												Honestly i'm really disappointed (read fully, not all whining, but constructive crit.)I've put 6 hours into this game, made it to level 18, and nearly finished everything there is to see. Did I enjoy my time? For the first few yeah it was beautiful and fun crashing down mountain sides. Then I took it to the challenges and it was there that I learned how empy, horribly executed, and unreliable the control schemes and some of the courses were. I wasn't losing to a lack of skill, I was losing to a lack of options. You have one option, hold R, release with a direction, and tweak. Nothing else. That's it. You let go to land. This is 2017 people, if my A button makes my guy say some dumb repetitive line, then obviously something is missing. You spent so much time putting four sports into the game that you forgot to actually spend time on each sport itself. The skiis are a clone of the snowboard, same controls, a bit faster and less turning. The only thing I found right and radical with this game was the wingsuit, my god did you get that wingsuit right. Now if you could do that for the other 75% of the game that'd be great. I think i've listened to a total of 6 or 7 songs over and over as well. You can create a game that big, but can't even put in more then a album of music or even just a simple option to play it from ps4/xbox/pc's storage. It's the same old go here, go there, uncover new sections of the map, beautiful but empty style of game making you've had since day one. Was there no one in your production team that said ""Hey, this game actually isn't great.. at all"" or did you just ignore your own employees and say f- it people will still buy. Honestly Ubisoft, I had such high hopes for this release and yet again you didn't deliver. I'm not asking for gods gift, I just want something playable and enjoyable, by you, and I feel like you have all this potential but never use it. You use grand maps and the same uncover/unlock gameplay, which is fantasticly fun, but don't make it the entire game. Instead try using it as a base for your next game, spend twice the time creating it and I promise people will love it. Look at Square Enix, who just redeemed years of horrible dissapointing releases with one, just one, title. (that they spent nine years on, not one) It's not that hard to listen to your customers and you obviously have the funding to pull something like that if you can crap out a new game every half a year or less. Sincerely,The guy who paid full price for the same thing i've owned since AC1.Last edited by Dj Big Noodle; 3 hours ago "

												Disclaimer----First things first to properly play this game you must go to the options and turn tricks safety off. Without doing this the game plays itself. It feels clunky in that you feel a massive disconnect from your player while doing tricks. It wont even let you initiate a trick if it doesn't think you'll land it. In the end if not turned off it just simply isant fun.I feel it is unfortunate that many of the  gripes people have with the game in general attribute it to the tricks safety option being on. Please give it a try without, and be willing to learn how to do tricks on your own. Review---     As a game that didn't really catch me in the beta, Steep really surprised me in both gameplay and progression. The physics feel great. Beyond a few glitches here and there regarding loss of momentum, they function wonderfully. The first few times down the mountain I just gained speed and barreled down like a lunatic. As my snowboarder/skier was speeding up he was hitting the bumps faster, and faster. Until I was going so fast that without me properly maneuvering I was tossed like a rag doll from the force of the bump. Some people may be turned off by the harsh reality that you do not have heels of steel and your bones may very well buckle under the force. But I think this adds to the fun, this forces you to manipulate the physics with the terrain. While also keeping a basic idea of what the human body can take in mind. Im personally a huge fan of dieing again and again cause I got impatient and just demanded speed. Falling can be half the fun. Keep in mind Steep is by no means a hard game but it captures the feeling that you can do anything if you can use all the mechanics well enough. And once you learn to properly carve, trick, etc. The game opens up a bit.      New events and areas of the mountain can be slowly unlocked by leveling up. You can do this by doing challenges, or simply by playing. You can view all of the events either by using your mountain view(World Map) or browse within your menu to see quickly whats new. When I played I said !♥♥♥♥! that! And scaled the god damn mountain on foot and found a bunch of cool areas right away. This took for ever but I wanted to see what the game was made of right off the bat.I love the option to explore and just get there anyway despite the level requirement to technically fast travel there. The game even rewards you XP for exploring. So I was pleased to see I wasn't limited to grinding early snowboard, or... Any parachute missions for that matter, before getting to the good stuff. (oh yeah, real quick the parachute missions are awful,boring ,and slow...  They just suck it doesn't hurt the game, I just ignore them till I inevitably have to do them). Where as the wing suit is exiting fast and fun. There are a surprising amount of areas that are tucked away that blew my mind when I found them. Be aware one of the best features of the game is the ability to switch to any of the other sports on the fly by simply stopping. Some of the most fun ive had with the wing suit was after being half way down the mountain on a snowboard, just finding a spot that looks nuts. No event, No mission, just pure discovery. Thinking, is this high enough to get enough lift? When it all comes down to it I find myself never using one sport for very long, and this is one of the games biggest strengths. While also being one of its biggest weaknesses. I love the game, Its scratching that skate itch that is oh so hard to reach now a days, but I would love to see some more sports added, purhaps a snowmobile? I feel boredom may loom in the future, but for now its the perfect hot seat game to play with friends. In the end though wanting more is rarely a bad thing, and with the promise of added sports I know ill at least check them out in the future even if I put this game down. It really is the most relaxing game on my list and fills a niche that no other game currently does. Perfect after work, kick back kinda game.-In short the multuiplayer does a good job at making the mountain not a lonely Barron place, by populating areas with random players.     The mupltiplayer fuction is great but limited. As far as moment to moment gamplay is concerned it places players randomly (it seems) into your game world. This works pretty well, I find people disappearing and returning sometimes but its not breaking. The game is at its best if you find a group willing to move together. The group up feature works great, simply by tapping x near another player will send a invite, once recieved all they have to do is press x to accept. I would like to have had options to possibly add more players. 4 player max feels a tad small, although I could see the sheer scope and speed of the game limiting the devs. My biggest complaint though is that there apears to be no way to directly compete with your fellow badasses. You can beat high scores and beat race times which is great. But it just doesnt make up for not being able to race neck and neck with another player. down the mountain.     Shareing and replays work great but not quite as good as skate. I have not found a way to share more then one run, which is a bit ehh. I will be tinkering with this feature more. Although it comes down to this really is a social game and i found a lot of fun to be found in watching others replays and sharing the expierince.      In closing I waited until it was on a $40 sale. Which really I have to say is the perfect price for this game. I feel like I got a great value for the content, I'm still having loads of fun, and at this point would even say if i put it down for good it was worth playing. It is one of the few games that me and my girlfriend can sit down and play for hours without getting bored and for that I thank you UBI soft.			"

A Steep price for a mountain of fun Steep is an extreme winter sports simulator developed by everyone’s favourite company, Ubisoft. (Don’t let that put you off). It predominantly features the Alps but Ubisoft recently introduced some Alaskan slopes too as part of a free update. In Steep you take to the slopes with a snowboard or skis or you take to the skies with a wingsuit or a paraglider. You can complete challenges and events already in the game or you can simply explore the mountain, finding new points of interest, challenges and the best lines you can come up with.When you first get to the Alps, you’ll be struck by the game’s beauty (even if you’re running it on Medium/Low like I am). The dev team did a great job at creating the Alps in-game and you’ll get some truly stunning vistas fairly regularly in the game. Hurtling through a lush forest or gliding your way to a different peak, it’s going to look good. There are some muddier textures which look a bit rough when you get up close (particularly rock textures) but I didn’t see those too often. The ‘main way’ to play the game is through the challenges and events. Of course, you don’t have to these but they are the best way to unlock Steep credits (used to purchase customization options) and earn EXP (some events have level requirements). There are a few different kinds of events. You have Freestyle events (snowboard or skis) in which you have to score a certain amount of points, you also have Extreme Rider events where you score points by narrowly dodging objects. Bonebreaker challenges can be wingsuit or ground events, they feature doing ridiculous things that inevitably lead to you knocking the ever-living ♥♥♥♥ out of your rider several times before success (they’re a lot of fun). You also get race events for the wingsuit and paragliding disciplines. There are also some story-ish ‘challenges’ called Mountain Stories which attempt to tell you a story while you complete objectives such as destroying snowmen or following another rider. Personally, I didn’t see the point in trying to tell a story with the game but the challenges themselves are pretty fun. So, as I mentioned, some challenges require scoring a certain number of points to be successful. Unfortunately, the game’s trick controls suck and there are no tutorials to help you. The only tutorials are for how you can ollie and then flip or spin, which is good to know but will net you hardly any points. For snowboarding or skiing it’s all about the grabs you do and the game doesn’t teach you how to do anything other than the most basic grab. I had to look up a separate tutorial to figure out how to do and start getting decent scores on jumps. Getting combos is also very important for racking up high scores, the only way to end a combo is to fall over which happens if you take a few hits (bad landings or riding into an object) or if you just go head first into the ground, that’ll mess you up pretty good surprisingly enough.Now, as much as I enjoy Steep and I think Ubisoft Annecy did a good job with it, there is one part of this game which is simply unforgiveable. It’s always online (and Ubi servers can’t be connected to if you have University WiFi without a VPN connection). It’s one of the most ridiculous design decisions I’ve ever seen in a game. The multiplayer aspect of Steep isn’t even slightly interesting, you can see other riders around the mountain (since you’re always online) and you can group together with them but that just means that the game lets you know what you’re doing and lets you compete with their scores on challenges you’re both doing. Sure, it’s an okay implementation of multiplayer and it can be kind of cool but it most certainly isn’t worth having the game always online. I really hope they add offline functionality before they inevitably shut down the servers. As much as I like the game and want to like Ubisoft for making it, you can’t argue anything other than this is a super ♥♥♥♥♥♥ move on their behalf.As I mentioned earlier, there are a few different rewards for completing challenges. Levelling up your rider is done by earing EXP from challenges which then unlocks new event challenges (like a Red Bull Extreme Rider event) and new Mountain Story events. Some challenges reward you with items such as new helmets, boards, wingsuits etc. that can only be unlocked by completing said challenges. Lastly, you earn Steep credits (the in-game currency) which can be used to buy more items from the in-game store such as ridiculous unicorn costumes, an imp wingsuit as well Helicopter tickets. Helicopter tickets are used to drop you anywhere on the mountain, very handy if you don’t fancy a trek up a steep incline to find a new dropzone. The customization options can be pretty fun to mess around with but they’re definitely not the main focus of the game and it’s really easy to earn Steep credits so there’s no need to pay for microtransactions.One of Steep’s strongest points is how quickly the game changes pace. If you want to find your own line from a dropzone it can be an incredibly relaxing experience that’ll take your mind off of the real world for a while. It can also be a controller smashingly infuriating game when you’re playing the hardest challenges, failing time and time again before you finally get the sweet satisfaction of beating the challenge. Last but not least, this is not a $60 game. I paid $30 for the base game which I’m happy with but I think I’d probably feel different about the game if I had dropped $60 on it. There’s a lot of content here, I still have plenty more to do, and you can create your own content too (finding your own lines etc.) if that’s your kind of thing but this is one to pick up on a sale of at least 50% off.Verdict Steep is a niche game and it doesn’t come without issues but it’s an incredibly enjoyable game that takes you from exhilarating wingsuit challenges, dipping and diving down cliff-sides, to relaxing snowboard rides through a snow-covered forest. It’s well worth picking up on sale whether it’s the kind of game you’d usually play or if you’re looking for something a tad different.El K.			"

												Steep is a pretty casual and fun game, its stress relieving and overall just fun to snowboard down a mountain and do some tricks, i personally love the snowboard and havent used the other 3 sports (skiing, paragliding and wingsuit). I have been snowboarding once or twice a few years ago so sort of relate. I feel like the other 3 sports are underused i have as of writing this review 6.6 hrs and i have seen only one person using skiis. Its opitional whether to use skiis or snowboards in the challenges.If you are going to get this game wait for a sale since i would say the only real con about this game is the price, 59,99 is too much for what it offers, around 29.99 is probably the max price i would say this game can go for.For more fun turn off trick safety "

												Very fitting name given the price of the game. It's fine and fun, but ultra repetitive. Make no mistake, the only difference in the different types of way to go down the mountain are in terms of speed, otherwise, it's a pretty shallow experience. Skis- Really fastSnowboard - pretty fastWingsuit - average speedParachute - ridiculously slowI gave it a good shot but after a little more than an hour I could feel that this was going to be one of those games that after the initial buzz wore off, I'd never go back to it again. BTW, ran at a solid 60 FPS, with everything maxed and shadows on low (I always set shadows to low in every game) and I have a very average AMD 8320, 8gig ram and a Geforce 1060			"

												Played ""Open Beta"" when the game came out, and have to say I've been hooked from day 1. There were a few technical flaws, and the game control scheme can take some getting used to, but the released game is a best wintersports game I've ever played.It's the type of game that can be frustrating at first, but with practice is extremely fun and rewarding. The game offers 4 different sports (Skiing, Snowboarding, Paragliding, and Wing-suiting) which give the player different ways of exploring and tricking down the mountain.But have to say that the ""Paragliding"" feels a bit boring and non attractive, but Skiing, Snowboarding and Wing-suit feels awesome. Those looking for the next SSX, arcade-style game will be disappointed. This game strives for a more realistic and scenic take on extreme snow games, where each run has to be approached strategically.			"

												Im pleasantly surprised with this game, it runs and plays great and if you have done snow sports in real life it feels pretty natural to start hitting the hills! The game has a allways online function but in my opinion it adds to the immersion because you will see other people around you hitting the hills and wiping out and stuff also I have never had a DC or lag in the 11 hours I have played so server stability seems good. With the graphics maxed out and a mix of MSAA and supersampling Steep still runs at above 60 FPS on a GTX980. The game seems well optimised and is fully utilizing the hardware running it. I play with a friend most the time and getting our group going is easy and quick and shredding the different challanges together is alot of fun. I have never really been a fan of snow sports games but this one caught my eye and im glad it did because I can see myself playing alot more before the fun wears off!			"

												When I heard about Steep, I thought it sounded like a great idea for a game but there would be no way it would be done right or hold my attention. I'm happy to say my speculation was drasticly wrong. While it doesn't hold your hand to get started, the first few missions are relatively easy to identify and give you just enough information to continue your exploration. You only need to be mildly curious to start your adventure into the vast playable area of the Alps. The more you play, the more curious you will get. This map has a ton to offer and is bafflingly huge. Seriously, zoom in on yourself on the map and slowly zoom out. Your mind will be blown. Among the things to do in this game are, snowboarding, skiing, paragliding, and windsuiting. Within each of these sports, there are many different types of challenges. From racing, to freestyle, to finess manuevering in the snowboarding and skiing sports, to skydiving, proximity racing and stunt racing in the windsuiting, there is plenty to keep you interested. Paragliding features racing, but where it really shines is when you use it to explore the mountain, peacefully taking in the breathtaking scenery. It truly is a beautiful world.All of these things are at your fingertips at anytime. UI and the map allow you to seamlessly teleport to any discovered point at anytime and use whatever equipment you want from any point on the map. Technically, the game has been supurb for me. I play at 2x hdr on my 2560x1080 monitor will max settings and Multisample AA off. I also upped the pixel multipler to 110%.One con of the game, and this is just a personal thing, is that i can't directly share replays from the game to social media. I'd like to see this feature added in the future. Let me know if you have any concerns about the game. I truly believe it is worth the $60 as it will keep you engaged for many hours of spectacular fun.9/10 "

												STEEP is simply a GOOD game. It is nothing amazing, but it is certainly good. The most impressive thing is the world Ubisoft has created and the beutiful graphics that make the experience more inriching. It must be said that without this level of visual quality, I would not buy this game.Skiing and Snowboarding feels virtually the sameParagliding is the worst thing I have done in my lifeBUTWingsuitting is one of the g r e a t e s t things I have done on PC.The developers are really into keeping an active community through constant events and even adding an entire new map. I purchased with the season pass, so the edition of base jumping, rocket wings, speed gliding, and sledding seem extremely fun aswell, and I would definitly recommend getting the DLC when they are realeased. While many complain about a lack luster trick system, I can't disagree. I just think that this game isn't about the tricks your doing on the mountain, but instead of mashing buttons at the peak of your jump, you will look over the ridge of the mountain, and find a new slope to tackle once you land.

												A solid winter game. This feels like SSX (controls) yet feels completely new. It implements some mechanics (g-force) in a way which forces the player to manage the riders control much more, in a good way. This game is packed with challenges and content for a completionist like myself to complete. The prifce tag is quite big but the amount of content in the game + level of quality makes up for that. Additionally...the snow in this game is INCREDIBLE. The sound design and feeling of moving in the snow is nearly 1:1 to reality, it is extremely satisfying to play and get good at playing.I highly recommend this to fans of the SSX series and people who want to play a snowboard, ski, wingsuit and paraglide suit. Don't pick it up if you are curious since you might not be too happy with the price, but winter enthusiast will love the feeling you get in this game. Very well done!			"

												Steep is an open world extreme sports game. If you decide to play with friends get ready for some competitive gameplay in an extremely unforgiving enviroment. This isnt your average open world game but it holds true to its name i have played 41 hours with multiple friends helping to discover everything and still am no where close to riding every part of the mountains.  If your looking for a game to really sink some hours into this is a must have. No matter what you expect from this game you will not be disapointed. The gameplay and visuals are absolutely SAVAGE, once you try it you wont put it down for a while.			"

												Great game in general, big fan of skate and this is like the snow version of that, pretty much go wherever you want and everybody is diverse in what they do ranging from costumes to clothes to snowboading or ski'ing etc, The one negative in this game is the Geforce meter, such a pain when you want to chain tricks together but you just cantr because you lose geforce for no reason either this should be completely removed or something else should be added in because sometimes I just lose Geforce for no reason, 9/10 such a good game would recommend to anybody who likes skate or who likes winter sports, P.S The graphics on this game are amazing, ultra on Pc is just stunning, insane game to play and still not burnt out even for play 10 hours pretty much straight.EDIT: While there are other options such as SSX, this game just has a better feel and really makes skill shine where it has to be shown, for example in SSX it seems like it is a massive trick chaining arcade game whereas steep seems to be a bit calmer with nice smooth flowing tricks shine and due to how hard the game is which it is not that hard but never the less, it really makes people that have practiced and that have mastered the tricks,This game has a lot of tricks but people beg to differ, a lot of people diss the game due to the fact that you are not able to grind, manual etc.. but it is that this game has only been released for a little while so there is a big chance that we could see new tricks, expansions, new mountains, storys, cosmetics, a new sport? cases even! its just that this game has so much potential and for most this game is an eye capturing game that focuses on the people that have skill and really shows them off, the only negative in this edit is for the freestylers out there, if you havent already picked this game up, there are different ways to play the game, explorer, freerider, bone crusher, etc.. and also Freestyler, personally this is my favourite way to play as to me it is the most fun but anyways, I find that people often not glitch but abuse the way that freestyle courses are meant to be played, for example on the first freestyle course they have gone down 3/5 ramps done the same trick and then gone back up with their snowboard or ski's this wasnt the way that freestyler was meant to be played as it is cheating the game due to the fact that it does not have a timer so people just go down a couple ramps and go back up rinse and repeat get a massive score and then finish to then be on the all time leaderboard for everyone to see. freestyler desperately needs a timer to stop this from happening.

												Let's jump into it!Literally!!!From the first step you take in the steep tutorial you get introduced to the beautiful and breathtaking world of Steep.You start off by doing the tutorial. If you proceed slowly and pay attention to the instructors tips and hints, you will be a professional anytime soon. You can chose between the challanges Ubisoft created for you or just buy helicopter tickets and go for an unreachable location to start freeriding. To spice things up, you can invite friends or random people which you pass by and create challanges for your party! MechanicsI am not sure if it is my personal controller handling or something, but paragliding needs some tweaks. The AI's fly off with an unseen speed while I am stuck at a relatively low speed. (Once again, could be just me)Sound / MusicF... me sideways in the most collosal way you can imagine... The sound effects are so damn accurate. The way that the powder snow stamps together as you ride over it is very very very (very x 10000) realistic. The music is something I find very fitting to the challanges and the game in general, although I think there should be a bigger variation? I only heared about 4-5 different songs so far.Suggestions Music: Unlock new tracks as you enter new zones or by doing challanges.Maybe even by purchasing them with the in-game currency.Switching Riding styles while mid air.Let the hate flow trough on this suggestion, but I think it should be awesome to switch from snowboarding to paragliding if you make a big jump aka big air. This would be a nice update which I would love to see happening in steep.Thank youA special thanks and a brief moment off silence for the developers, riders and everyone who has put a hand on this piece of artwork. I trust that Ubisoft as well as the Steep crew will take this game to certain hights.  Estelle BaletYou were too young to leave the snowboarding scene. I am sure you would love this game as well.You are missed Estelle!Take care, the brightest star!			"

												Steep satisfies my mountain sports gaming requirments and hopefully is the start of a series of adrenalin fueld extreme sports game franchises.The price is high, however its not a cash grab by ubisoft. its the start of a new franchise and its first iteration should be built upon by further support.   The price is normal for a AAA studio title in todays world. but still to some its suggested as being to Steep for them. but the play per hour rate is fantastic. 200 hours minimum i am expecting. The quality of this game is not on a par with anything else ive seen. and extreme sports games are one of my goto game genre . The genre in general is bereft of attention. The developers have captured the sheer feeling of mountain life and the fun associated with the sports on offer. As a fan of similar genres such as tony hawk and skate series. and shaun whites snowboarding game. and everythin else Steep is the next iteration of such titles. I snowboard and skateboard in real life and Steep scratches the itch i have. When played with friends it is very reminsicent of my time spent doing the mountain thing in real life. the planning. the exploring. which really is exploring given the vast scope of whats presented. the mountain landscape size available is certainly life like. taking around 20- 30 minuites to ""safely"" reach the bottom so to speak. and that is if you have navigated it correctly. Very happy with the purchase is all i can end this with. Smooth release by ubisoft. servers fine for first day. never thought id see the day that ubisoft cares about their own product but it appears to be that. . Steep was made with love by people that love mountain life and the associated gaming that can be had from it. the ""Art"" of game creation is contained within I am pleased to say.			"

												Played the beta, bought the game straight after its release.Pros:-Open World-Every run is different and unique-Online is smooth for meeting random players.-Good CustomizationCons:-World is big, but not that big-Tricks/Jumps seem repetitive-Playing with friends is all right but sometimes glitchy.-18 hours in, allready reached max level (25)So basically this game is pretty good but like every game it has flaws. Do not get this game if you don't like grinding since the only way to get money is by completing missions/challenges. One good thing is the ""Specialities"" you can choose; basically there like 4 or 5 different ways you can snowboard: Blue, Green, Orange, Black and the colours are the different points you get so like if you go on ice you get orange points (extreme) and if you go around places and explore then you get green points (explorer). The controls when you first start of can be a bit weird but once you get into the game you learn enhanced tricks and stuff like that. All in all I would probably say get this game if you have loads of money but if your poor wait for the sales. "

												This game is pretty fun for the first 15-20 hours, so I would say it's worth the money.There are however some downsides to this game.- Bugs- ProgressionWhen it comes to bugs, there's a lot of minor ones, and they add up. Camera issues, physics that make very little sense, stuff like that.Progression is a slighly bigger issue. As you progress in the game, it stops being about you doing the ""coolest tricks"" and starts being more of a ""do the same tricks, but avoid a million rocks while you do it"". I don't personally like it, and it will be the reason I eventually stop playing. I'm looking forward to the DLC though.			"

												The controls got updated in a recent patch and I can now confidently say that I recommend this game. The coolest things, in my opinion:-No loading times!! The game boots up quickly and then you never experience a loading time, ever. You can traverse the whole mountain and fast travel wherever without waiting. Awesome.-The range of gameplay. You can hike slowly across a mountain range experiencing lush vistas, and you can scream toward the ground in a death spiral with your wingsuit. Skiing and snowboarding have distinct feels, and both are satisfying. Paragliding is pretty boring and awkward, unfortunately, but it is an easy way to get from place to place without crashing.-Ragdoll/bail on command-Giraffe costume squeaks on impact-Variety of challenges to suit your playstyleThis game is basically what you make of it. It doesn't have a concrete campaign or storyline, but there are narratives throughout. Easy to jump in and play. The multiplayer aspect I feel is not very fleshed out- you can't communicate with people not on your friends list- but lends some life to the game.			"

												Personally, I am loving the game! I have a ton of fun just cruising lines with the chill play list going. It's super relaxing. The environment is absolutely beautiful! This is especially apparent when you using the wing suit and flying around the environment. There have been plenty of times where I have just been wow'ed by how realistic and picturesque it looks! Carving with ski or snowboard down the mountains is so much fun! You can tell that the devs put a lot of love into this game. Some cons for me have been the challenges. There isn't a whole lot of direction with them and when you unlock a new challenge, it's hard to know where it is. There are a couple of little bugs with the trick system and handling that can be a bit annoying but they are minor. Over all, Steep is the first game that I have truly enjoyed that hasn't involved guns and violence, not that that is band thing. I would definitely recommend it despite the price tag. I have zero regret paying $60 for the game.			"

												Excellent game!  I bought this mostly for the snowboarding, but the other sports are great as well.  This genre has been neglected for some time, and it's such a relief that Steep delivers.  The day after release, I played for over eight hours straight without a hint of boredom (highly unusual for me).  Start with the challenges, but stay for the exploration and sharing features.  It took me a bit over two hours to even start appreciating the scope of this game.  For those complaining about the standard triple-A price tag, this map alone justifies it.  You really can go anywhere, and it is impossible to fully appreciate the map without dropping in hundreds – if not thousands – of times.  I have found nothing but beautiful, diverse, well-crafted areas that are perfect for exploration and creating your own lines.  At the time of this review (about ten hours in-game), I have not even seen most of the map (much less been bored or run out of things to do).  I already know that I will be racking up hundreds of hours with Steep.  The trick system does take some time to get used to, but eventually become quite intuitive.  I highly recommend watching the official Ubisoft tutorial videos over on YouTube.  This is a true triple-A title:  fantastic gameplay, well-optimized, bug-free, zero connectivity issues, and excellent graphics.

												The more time I spend in Steep the more I am enjoying it.  I find I spend most of my time just riding down the mountain with no objective but to relax and explore.  Skiing and snowboarding feel different enough where I find myself picking between the two for certain challenges.  Wingsuit flying is way more fun than I ever thought it would be.  The more difficult wingsuit challenges that send you flying through canyons and around rock formations can be quite tricky and require a lot of trial and error figuring out the correct line to hit the checkpoints.  When you finally get the right line it is supremely satisfying.  Paragliding is the aspect of the game I have spent the least time with and haven't had the same enjoyment as I have with the other 3 sports.  Though with time and practice that may change.  It is very useful for scaling mountain sides and getting up to new spots to ski or wingsuit from.Coming from the SSX series the trick system took several hours to get used to.  I guess you could say it was a ""Steep"" learning curve... for me at least.  You can't prewind for rotations like in SSX, you do your rotations and flips after you have jumped and the timing can be critical.  Timing your jump also seems to be more important here.  Late jumps will really hurt your ability to do any trick at all and early jumps will limit your air time.  Tricks feel more rooted in realism here than SSX and there is nothing along the lines of an uber trick to be found.  All of this makes it so much more satisfying to land a big trick.Challenges are plentiful and varied.  You can participate in freestyle trick competitions looking to get the most points possible.  Variations on this include getting the most point on one jump or getting a big score on a line that may not be so conducive to freestyle riding.  There are free ride challenges in which your objective is to reach the finish line in the most expeditious manner.  Some of them have checkpoints you need to hit while others just have a finish line and it's up to you to find the fastest line possible.  Wingsuit challenges mostly consist of proximity flying and extreme challenges.  Proximity flying nets you point for flying in ""proximity"" to the ground and obstacles.  The extreme challenges are the most fun (to me) as I had mentioned above.  Paraglide challenges I don't have that much experience so I can't really say.  There are also some fun challenges in the vein of SKATE when your objective is to get the worst fall.  You achieve this by getting the most g's inflicted on your rider in a single fall.  I am only 44% through the game so there may be even more challenges out there that I haven't tried yet.  You can also make your own challenges to share with friend simply by riding a line and then sharing it afterwards and setting which type of challenge you'd like it to be.Plenty of gear to collect and customize your riders.  All of the gear is purely cosmetic and don't offer any boosts to your riders like they would in an SSX.  All lot of it you can buy with the in game currency you earn from challenges and some is only unlocked by completing certain Mountain Stories or achieving a certain medal on a challenge.  Gear ranges from normal jackets and pants to some pretty outlandish full costumes.  There is enough there to make your rider look unique out on the slopes.I know a lot of people are comparing this game to the SSX series.  You can't really compare the two as they are very different products but the comparisons are inevitable.  If you are looking for the over the top point fests of say SSX Tricky then this may not be the game you are looking for.  The closest the SSX series comes to what Steep is was SSX 3.  If you, like me, had a lot of fun just starting at the top of the mountain and free riding your way to the bottom, then you'll enjoy Steep's vast open mountain world.Overall a great game so far and I definitely recommend it.TL;DR - If you love winter sports and exploration, definitely check it out.  If you want a trick/point-fest like the SSX games, I'd still recommend it.  There is enough there for freestyle riders and you may find other parts of the game you enjoy.			"

												Played the crap out of the Beta and really enjoyed it, caved and bought it before it was on sale. I am terrible at anything winter sports related and will probably never base jump in my life so this is a good fix, enjoy carving up the hill or doing challenges alone or with friends. You can link up with 3 other friends for fun on the slope. Can customise your rider down to the boots, gloves and accessories on your backpack etc.   Fun 10   Exploration 10   Controls 9   Price 7/8   Soundtrack 10  "

												Outside of the time shown, I've also played in two betas. The closed beta at the start of November, and the last open beta a week or so ago.While I can certainly argee with the comments about the game not being worth the full price tag, it's a decent enough title to just blow an hour or two on. Either to attempt the runs left by the developers, or to just unwind and chill out or go as mental as you want.The controls are a little confusing if you're coming off titles like the SSX series, and the G-Force system makes the later trick based challenges a pain given the seemingly random nature of it, but outside of that and a bit of practise, you can pull off some pretty epic jumps.EDIT. As with the release of Alaska, they've now changed the flip/spin system so that you can ""preload"" the rotation before the jump. This is a mild improvement, but still is a little tricky as you still have full control of turning. The only real down sides I can think of right now, outside of the price, is that I don't agree with the hard limit of four players to a lobby, if the lobby system is even working. I spot the odd player or two spawning somewhere near me, and then they either vanish, or spend most of the ten minutes I can see them 10k meters away. Add to that and the need to physically behind them to invite to the party, and I seriously question why Ubisoft did it this way. There also seems to be a few issues with inviting friends, but I cannot comment on that due to no-one else playing this.Overall, I'd wait for a price drop or more content before pulling the trigger. It's rare enough for games like this to come out on the platform, and Steep certainly is worth trying, outside of a few questionable design choices. I mean, currently your only other option is SNOW. And I don't think I need to explain the differences there, do I?			"

												Brilliantly done open world extreme sports game. It's like if Skate was a snowboarding game where you could also ride skis, and also fly around in wing suits and with a paraglider. The gameplay is perhaps a bit on the simplistic side, but on the flipside it makes it so its very easy to pick up and play while allowing the game to throw some truly outrageous challenges at you later, where winning those are all about skill rather than memory of systems.The game is the sort of thing that is best enjoyed over time I feel. Its a massive world with tons and tons of different missions and events, and trying to grind all of it could be overwhelming. Instead, the game seems to want you to treat it like going on a mountain trip, where its awesome to pick up if you feel like rushing down some hills or relaxing and exploring the snowy landscape someday.If you're a fan of games like Skate, 1080 Avalanche or just the idea of a huge open world that is built for sports and exploration rather than combat and collectibles I highly recommend it. Having tons of fun with it and I feel its the sort of game I will keep coming back to regularly.Also, you can dress up as a panda and bug other players while spamming panda noises in their ears, so there is that too+4 different gameplay types+Easy to pick up and play+Huge world with tons to do+Great sense of immersion+Exploration+Weird cheesy humor-A tad repetitive at times-Soundtrack is kinda annoying-Weird cheesy humor-Ubisoft nonsese(Played it a bunch in the beta so my playtime is probably actually closer to 15 hours rather than 9 when I wrote this review)			"

												Ubisoft are seriously getting better with their open world games,  they are keep improving themselves with each tittle. Steep is one of them , map  is huge already and it will expand with future DLCs. There are many fun stuff to do either solo or with friends, snowboarding,skiing,wingsuit,paragliding.  It's a great Winter Sports Open World Game and pretty challenging to master all the tricks.If you are fan of  Winter Sports/Extreme Sports/Alpine skiing, then pick this game up, it might be expensive but worth it at the end.There are no Snowkiting,Snowmobiling or Monoski, but they might arrive with DLC.

												Update: The controls have changed significantly since release and I can now land tricks hassle free so kudos to the dev team.Steep is truly the game of my dreams, it has everything I've ever wanted from a winter sports video game, and then some. While the online only requirement might seem like an odd choice, it hasn't deterred me in the least from enjoying this game. It is the perfect playground for a chilling session whether you're looking to ride solo or with friends. Visually, the game looks stunning, the scenery is beautiful and the music complements it very well.A few bugs here and there and some minor annoyances aside, Steep is one of the best snow sports games to have come out. It's probably the only game I need this year and that's saying something.			"

Since I love backcountry riding, this seemed like a good option. I get extremely stoked playing this game and it gets my ♥♥♥ in line for the weekend when I can put a real board on.The snow conditions are great in the game and you can have fun even just kicking up a rooster tail in deep powder. I wish I could nerf the tricks though to make it a bit more realistic, but at least it isn't as intense as SSX.			"

												Okay so lookWhen I bought this, I was skeptical that it would even run well on my computer. However after a relatively quick install, I discovered the game ran excellently at a capped 60 fps and I haven't even bothered to check without vsync. This was one in a list of many happy surprises I've had with this game so long story short here's my pro and con list.Pros:-Huge World once fully unlocked-Plenty of unique and challenging ""missions"" including the very creative mountain stories-Huge character customization with 8 (?) different characters and a huge variety of outfits and gear to choose from-The credit system in game is actually decent enough to where you don't have to buy credit packs to play the way you want -The gameplay feels fluid and controllable usually-The music choice is decent and there's even an option to turn off copyright music if you want to stream or make videos-The stunt replay feature is great for watching tricks and jumps from any angle-The wingsuit-Fun multiplayer and group sharingCons:-The voice acting can get repetitive-Always Online-Songs can also get repetitive-(Very rarely) a rock or object appears almost magnetic and messes with the downhill line- ""Not Enough Height"" for a trick if you jump too early but sail though the air (fixed by turning off trick safety)-The ""La Fieuse"" and ""Falling Rocks"" challenges-Paragliding while scaling the Matterhorn-The price of the gameOverall:Not a fan of the price and not a fan of the occasional snow magnetism but overall I really like this game and more specifically I love the wingsuit.8/10			"

												A beautiful game. Good atmosphere. Definitely has the replay value and is hopefully a good sign of change for Ubisoft. Even if the story is probably the most skippable story I've ever had to play through.I would definitely say that this game is good value for money, which is a rare statement nowerdays especially for myself who has been dissapointed with the gaming industry for the past few years, and Ubisoft has played a big part in my dwindling confidence with the gaming industry.Steep is flawed though, as to be expected by a game from Ubisoft, but these flaws do not apply to every aspect of the game and so do not completely ruin it!The almost gamebreaking camera plagues your every step, making it sometimes impossible to clearly see your path and definitely takes you away from the experience. The way your character interacts with the enviroment is inconsistant and is littered with tweening issues, bugs and glitches. I've discovered that all the issues ive had with the way my character travels around is due to the fact that the game keeps your board flat even if youre on a slope, which means if youre on an uneven surface your character doesnt try to adjust to the changes but simple stays static which leads to the many soul destroying crashes we all have to put up with.The scoring is unfair and is mostly based on luck, last night i just did the same trick for two hours, never getting the same score twice and the scores i did recieve did not reflect what had happened on the screen. Sometimes poorly executed tricks out perform well performed tricks and visa versa. I believe every player has had that moment where they have performed an amazing trick only to be given a +150. Then a while later your character spazzes out on a rock and youre given a score of +3200! In order to play this game you have to suspect disbelief and just wait for the good scores to come.The crashes - Yes...ive messed up. But does my character have to ragdoll down the whole mountain before i can start having fun again? A lot of the time its easier to just retry the event than wait for your character to stop ragdollingStory - ergh. characters - -vomits- Mountain Stories - jesus christ burn them with fire.			"

												Overall I have enjoyed this game so far, but I do feel that the price is a little much for what you get... That being said, good, current, snowboarding games with good physics and a large environment are very, very hard to come by. So if you're like me and you are just going into it looking for a great snowboarding/ skiing/ paragliding/ wingsuit experience, you'll enjoy it. Don't go into it looking for a riveting story or deep characters because you will be disappointed. The season pass adding sports that the base game doesn't include is kind of cheesy, especially at the price point of the  game but it doesn't bother me that much because I only really cared about the snowboarding.The one thing I would REALLY like to see in this game would be the added sport of snowmobiling. It would integrate so well in the game especially for finding new locations and if they added that it would be a definite pass for me. Overall good job on the game though, easy to tell they definitely spent some time on this one.			"

												This is mainly a single player game with some multiplayer features sprinkled on top. Unfortunately, it requires a constant internet connection for you to play, ostensibly to cater to this multiplayer element and to make the game ""better for you"" (if you do a quick google search you'll find this answer from Ubisoft on a number of forums). To me, though, it smells a little bit more of DRM. If your internet goes down (or their servers, which is not uncommon enough) you are locked out of your own game. Somehow, I'm having a hard time seeing how this makes Steep a better experience for me. It seems like not being able to play at all is a little bit worse than being able to play without real-time online challenge updates.Oh, and you also need to download Uplay and launch it through that, because apparently the way almost all other games launch is not a perfectly reasonable way for a game to launch. Better to force another client on people who willingly gave you some money for your game.The game is good, but I'm requesting a refund because Ubisoft are awful.			"

												After 10-20 hours of playing, I was going to give Steep a bad review but then everything changed (except for my underwear).The first thing you'll notice is that Steep is visually stunning (like me). It's easy to pick up (also like me) but when it comes to performing like a pro and knowing how best to get the most out of it, it's badly lacking in instructions or tips. Granted this may be because I'm stupid, but it took me longer than usual to figure out why I couldn't land tricks and do other stuff. Also the menu is rather unintuitive and seems to be filled with useless information (like me) that I don't have any interest in.That said, once I figured it all out and had spent enough time exploring the slopes, the enjoyment increased dramatically. By this time I had unlocked more locations and the courses became far more intense and challenging. All of a sudden I was getting nearly more air than what's between my ears and I also began to find locations that I could make a course/challenge out of. The speed you get on the steepest slopes is exhilarating and the slightest mistake will have you crashing like my mum on a motorbike. The wingsuit had also gone from getting into a starfish position and falling, to zooming through tricky rock canyons and caves that are destined to give you more brain injuries than what I’ve accumulated in real life from riding on the back of my mum’s motorbike.Paragliding has still yet to excite me but it is useful for exploring, especially as it can climb up when you get some wind under you and I kinda like the exploration element of the game. The narration during parts of the game tries to be cool but is pretty dull (like me once again) but totally makes up for it in the fashion stakes by offering numerous jackets in pink, though I would’ve liked to have seen 1-piece lycra bodysuits like they wear at the Winter Olympics. I like lycra.I could name a number of bugs, issues and things that should've been in the game but for $40au (on sale) I’m more than happy with my purchase.★★★★★★★★★✰			"

												I would recommend holding off on buying this game unless Ubisoft fixes the physics. There are many easily reproduceable problems like sticking to ledges instead of flying off, or not being able to jump because the area that they designed as a jump isn't the correct shape. I've found a couple races that are basically just trial and error because of these issues, there's no possible way to do well on them your first try because of the janky physics (and also terrible camera angles).

												I REALLY wanted to like this game. I'm not having any issues running it and it looks gorgeous. I can't tell you how excited I was when I heard about Steep. I loved Skate and completed every challenge in the game, and spent hours just free skating and making lines. I'm a bigger fan of snowboarding though and I haven't gotten into a snowboarding game since SSX tricky, which was arcady and completely unrealistic. So I was really looking forward to a more realistic snowboard game, where I could just throw on tunes and go crazy on the mountain. Steep is EXACTLY that, and I was ready to start sinking days into it. I got through the tutorial and started exploring the mountain, found a run I wanted to do and away I went.The controls though... my god... they just don't respond in a way that lets you feel like your character has any sort of flow.The timing just feels very off to put it plainly. You need to jump pretty early in comparison to any other skate/snowboard games, which is awkward at first, but forgivable once you get the hang of it. You use the LS to either flip or spin your character and LT or RT + RS for grabbing and tweaking. The grabbing works fine but the spins and flips seem to only work half the time I want them to. Theres a bit of a sweet spot just as you leave your jump to start a good spin or flip. The landing is where I gave up though. Even if I look like I'm coming into it perfectly, I bail more often than not. The whole experience made me feel more frustrated trying to get my character to do what I want, and land a regular jump FFS, rather than feeling awesome pulling off sweet tricks. Maybe i'm missing something, but it was enough that I uninstalled it. Hope they tweak the controls, it's close to being the perfect snowboard game. But right now I find it more frustrating than fun.			"

												This game is bad. The UI is impossible to comprehend. The controls— once you've mastered the very unconventional layout (and good luck, after the laughably shallow tutorial)— just flat-out don't work sometimes. The challenges become less about skill and instead about trying and re-trying until you finally complete a run in which the game actually responds to every input successfully.The laws of physics, too, seem to have been described to the programmers over the phone while on a crowded bus. I've lost count of how many times my character has built up speed by whizzing down a mountain only to come to a screeching halt atop the smoothest ramp in the Alps and stumbling uselessly off the lip.The snow is quite pretty, though, and you'll get plenty of time to admire it as the camera makes a point of aiming just low enough to ensure you've no idea of the precise moment to jump, then laughing in your stupid face as you bounce gracelessly down the cliff you couldn't see coming.If you're looking for a fun, challenging (for the right reasons), rewarding snow-sports game, I reccomend SSX.

												When I first found out about Steep, I was very excited because to me it looked like the hybridization of SSX: On Tour and Skate 3. And for the first two hours of the game, that's exactly what I got, however after that mark it rapidly declines in the key element rarely seen in Ubisoft games known as ""fun"". Visually, it's gorgeous, there's no arguing that. The way the snow sparkles under certain lighting conditions is wonderful, and the sound design as well is top notch. However, regarding gameplay, Ubisoft for some inane reason decided to take a sports game where you run around wearing an elk head while plowing through evil talking snowmen on your '90s dixie cup themed snowboard VERY realistic controls and trick physics. There is absolutely zero way to correct or change your rotation midair, often times landing is completely RNG which forces the player to restart races again and again and again and AGAIN for sometimes up to an hour. In a game as cosmetically goofy with tasks as ridiculous as some of the ones in game are, one would expect a control/trick scheme to be that of SSX or Skate no? Where you can string together multiple ridiculously impossible moves that defy all laws of physics? This game does not have that. None of it. It has the visuals of those older extreme sports games, but none of the gameplay. Crashing is punishing and frustrating, to the point where it makes you not want to do the trick based races after having the game ♥♥♥♥ you over so badly so many times in a row.Don't believe me and still want to try it out? Wait for a deep sale at the very least. One of my friends got this for me for Christmas because I had been talking about it for a while, and honestly I feel bad for that friend because his good intentions ended up getting wasted all because of poor marketing on Ubisofts part.

												I really don't know how to feel about this gameon one hand, it's beautiful and fun to explore and generally just pretty coolon the other hand, it really shoves ""haha sports"" ♥♥♥♥ in your face and the trick system and momentum feel super ♥♥♥♥ing weirdmusic is aight some of the timeoverall unless you're interested in exploring a snow covered mountain i wouldn't recommend buying it until it's like 30 bucks or somethingbut if you want that then i don't think there's pretty much any other options that are pretty like this so uh go for it			"

												The graphics are great, the map itself is most of the time something else, so its not repeating itself. It might look like its about the same every mountain, but it is not, while the challenges / quests are most of the time similiar (reach that point in this amount of time, score that much points etc.) the routes of the challenges is always something else. For my choice I like the Bones - Challenges the most fun. After about 1 day of gaming, I reached level 25 (max level) and rechead ""Legend"" in Freestyle, because I believe it is the easiest. The game is openworld, and you can change everywhere you like, but not on the run, so you have to get to a stop.What I dont like: The spawns of you character. If you travel to a Challenge by ""Mountain view"" I sometimes found myself on top of the location, where you used to spawn, like on a rock. But even more depressing is it, if you set yourself a spawn, and then try again and end up being teleported 1 Meter downwards in the ground, so you see the entire map from underground. Sometimes you can just fly out or ski out, but can't walk out which is really annoying. If you are in a group you don't just go for Gold, but try to get the higher score than your mates, so its much more fun and is more time consuming. Would I buy it again?- Probably, but its not made for everyone, some got other expectations. Was it fun? - Hell yeah.Will I be playing it more? - Only with some friends, even though I haven't got every character maxed out.Is this review too long?- Probably yes, sorry for bad english :)			"

												Back in the day I was a big fan of the Tony Hawk Series up until THUG2, and a played many snowboarding games mainly the SSX series. What Steep does is roughly the same idea but on a grander scale. Many will find this game to be reptitive, and that could be a similar thing said about Dynasty Warriors, but in saying this that describes the kinds of fanbases and what the game is offering. Steep offers a sandbox experience in which you can travel across an entire peak without load zones and compete in time trials, challenges or play amongst the various story missions. You have the options of Snowboarding, Skiing, Paragliding and Wingsuit/Sky Diving. The charm of the game comes from it's gameplay, IF YOU DO NOT LIKE THIS KIND OF GAMEPLAY, then I 110% recommend you do not buy this game, it will get boring quick. Although if you are a fan of the aforementioned sports games then I fully recommend this game.Performance wise, since the engine is rendering mostly snow and terrain LOD the game does run fairly well, I still would recommend having a decent setup as any thing below 60fps will turn anyone off on a fast paced xtreme sports game such as this.Graphically I would assume its a similar engine to other Ubisoft games but I have not done extensive research in this.Base game content isn't sparse although since it is a sandbox some of that comes down to the player also. With upcoming season pass content but also free content updates with an free Alaska peak DLC, I would say you are looking at a minimum 50 hours of content to muck around with until the DLC drops. Leveling up your main skill level will liekly be a quick experience [depends on your apptitude] but levelling up the various sub categories to the game will take some time.Live events are included also.8/10			"

												SO, i loved ""snow"" and i thought to myself. Gee this is a uplay game not some random dev.surely it has to be good. and for the most part it is.HOWEVER there are a MULTITUDE of problems i ran into within the first hour. overall the game is well optimized and operates well. but for me, ill stick to ""snow""The problems i have with it are as follows.1. its overpriced2. i ran into a fair few collision issues on some ramps.3. its seem to be WAY more about the challenges than ANY kind of free roam.3. (extended) i was free roaming and after about 5 ish minuets i got ""you have reached the border of the map"" and it made me restart. This happened 5 times. everytime i tried to make a long-ish run.4. a strange lack of pricision. you tell your character what to do and he does it on his own. I could not tell him to keep spinning or stop spinning. he just decided when he wanted to stop. and more often than not it was backwards (skiing).5. ANYTIME you touch a rock, for ANY reason. you take damage.6. the little wood ramps and Roofs just STOP you like a ROCK.7. the air physics feel OFF. you can speed up hardly at ALL on the parachute. and the wingsuit just feels like 3 settings, Dont fall vertically, fall vertically, and fall vertically faster. none of them felt like it slowed me down or sped me up at all.8. You have 0 control on ice.You can stop no problem, but anything else is a NO. I HAVE SKI POLES PUSHING ME FORWARD. and im sliding completly sideways. 9. I just felt stuck to the ground unless you press jump. otherwise you never leave the ground. little ridges in the snow? NOPE magnet feet. In the end im just not that impressed with it at all.			"

												If you chose to stay inside to play games because the ski hill has conditions so lousy the drive isn't worth it, this game is for you.If you're wondering if you could customize the character to look like your actual ski/board setup (no you can't, the item selection sucks), this game is for you.If you when look at a mountain you see sweet colouir lines and wonder if you could ever ski them, this game is for you.Anyone else will be bored of this game in a half dozen hours.

												Honestly, it looks great. has really good physics in a genre that doesnt have a lot of good games. but 79.99 is just way too much to ask for the content you get with this game. if you seriously love these games and need one in your life by all means buy it. but if you can go two more months without it just wait. theres simply not enough content to be worth this much. I played for an hour. realized this is what it was and got a refund. i will buy it back when its 29.99, like it shouldve been at launch.			"

												So I played about an hour of the game and to be honest there's not much game here.Steep is an open world winter sports game developed by Ubisoft Annecy. It’s got a pretty cool concept in that you travel around a big mountain range finding new routes to do races or points trials in 4 different sports, snowboarding, skiing, wingsuit flying and paragliding. You can compete with friends to get high scores and medals and stuff and that’s about it really. Unfortunately after about half an hour it really wore thin on me and for £40 there’s just nowhere near enough content to justify a purchase.On the plus side it looks ♥♥♥♥ing awesome with snow reacting to you walking through it the draw distances are really impressive and it has a solid sountrack too. Performance is also top notch, no frame drops at all. You do get people yelling cringy ♥♥♥♥ though, stuff like “this is living” when snowboarding down a mountain, might as well get them to say “radical dude” or something. The controls were a bit unresponsive as well and the scoring system makes no sense, this main video is me getting a gold on a challenge despite messing up every attempt at a trick. Good job Ubisoft.Can’t recommend it, if it gets some DLC to flesh it out it could be fun but £40 for this is pretty crappy value for money. 3/7 no bobsleighing.If you want to watch my review on YouTube you can here: It's only a minute long!

												Great game if you're into the extreme sports stuff but it has its flaws for sure. Before I get to the bad, let me emphasize that this really is a nice snowboarding/skiing game, with a little bit of flight as well. The mountains are beautiful, there's a lot of diversity between mountain ranges as far as rockiness/'steep'ness go, the challenges can be pretty fun, and the multiplayer isn't THAT dead. Not to mention very nice customization. But, as for the drawbacks, - soundtrack is okay but there's maybe a total of 20 songs, that you'll be hearing over and over again. - mechanics can be a little buggy at times, though overall they aren't bad. Just expect to get hung up and flung around ridiculously sometimes when you hit slopes sideways or the edges of rocks. - controls for keyboard are fine. I have 99% of my playtime on it and can't complain. I plugged in a Steam controller and Xbox just for the sake of this review, and while the Steam controller is pretty good the Xbox controller is fantastic for this game, almost makes me wish I had been using it all along. Very well integrated. However, if you get used to keyboard you aren't losing out by not having one.- Only took me about 24 hours to 100% all challenges w/gold medals and get all drop zones. There is a lot of replayability, though, and it feels like a lot more content than 24 hours makes it sound. I give this game a thumbs up, but consider some of the other things you could do with $60 before purchasing.			"

												10/10 would crash while wingsuiting again. - Gameplay: Awesome- Handling: Great- Graphics (ultra): Fantastic- Playerbase: Fine- Atmosphere and music: Just perfect- GoPro (first person): Crazy- Share your ride: Just do it!- Glitches: I have only had 1 during 5 hours of playing which is pretty good not forgetting it's a ubisoft game! (I was stuck in the ground for 2 seconds after crashing on my snowboard)Conclusion: It's just a great game to play at any time, especially when you're bored of playing shooting games allthe time. You can choose for yourself how intensive you make this game (challenges or freeroaming). Just buy the game and you'll see it for yourself!(I don't recommend buying it for the full price dough. In my opinion this game is worth about $30 - $40, so if you can pick it up for that price, then just do it!)			"

												Steep is a game that I had high expectations for. As a kid I loved to ski and still do, nothing beats looking down a snowy white mountain with snow hitting your face. The feeling is like nothing else in the world, a feeling like at any point everything can go wrong but it doesn't. When you go down the mountain your making art, your trail is your trail and can never be fully replicated. Steep nails this feeling perfectly. The world is beautiful and gives you the freedom of creating your own lines and doesn't force you on a set pathway. The ski/snowboard physics are very good and but there is one gripe I have with them and thats the way they interact when on rocks. The game plays it off as it being impossible to have control on any rock surface which can really ruin a great run. The challanges themselves are all very fun except for the paragliding ones. I rarely got frustrated while playing except when I had to paraglide up the Matterhorn. Even though I still got Gold it was one of the few times during the game where I didn't want to continue, ddn't want to explore the next slope or challange ahead of me. Some say this game is light on content but I truely dissagree. On paper this isn't on $60 dollar game but when you break it down and actually understand the range of things you can do it's unbeliable. The soundtrack is amazing at times and irritating occasionally as well but I found that most songs were enjoyable to listen to even though they are almost all liscenced music. A common misconception with this game is that it's the next SFX or tony hawk pro skater with a snowboard. That's not true, it's more of a mix of a simmulator and if Skate was a winter sports game. I very much do recomend Steep at it's launch price tag since it's a game that has more under the initial layer that you just need to find. Find the perfect slope and racing down wiith friends or other online players is insanely fun. I expect to continue playing this for a while and I can't wait to see what more it has in store.8.5/10 -Infinite			"

												I dont ever write reviews but had to say my piece on this game. I have owned the game about a week and have put 16 hours in, everytime i turn on my pc steep is the first game i want to play, its amazing!I'm not a big snowboarding fan i have never done it in my life though i did love ssx and cool boarders (for you old school guys out there) so for anyone that likes the idea of snowboarding, skiing, wing suit jumping, paragliding, this game is for you.I had read reviews saying that the game wasn't worth the price so i waited for the christmas sales and got it then, but honestly if i knew how good the game was i would have bought it for the full price without hesitation.it's open world and the map is huge, and there are so many missions and things to do, weather you want to free roam and make your own trails (which can then be saved and shared with friends) or to do all the main and side missions.The game has a couple of bugs which can be expected for a new game and none are by any means game breaking just minor menu glitches and things like that.The game can be frustrating at times for you guys like me that wish to get gold in every mission, as some are really difficult and takes a hell of a lot of attempts, i'm level 20 so far and have made gold in each event so keep at it!Highly rate the game and with dlc's and extra content that will be released it's only going to get better. And the graphics are amazing!!!!If anyone out there is in 2 minds about getting it i recommend you do, you wont regret it.			"

												This game is super under rated. I played the beta and it was ♥♥♥♥ unoptimized and controls seemed ♥♥♥♥ poor. After playing the release version I was quickly surprised at how much they optimized and improved the controls. I am an avid skier and this game is as close as you can get to the real thing. A nice mix of reality simulation and action adventure style play. The graphics are absolutely breath taking. The physics are really good. HUUUUUUUGE map absolutely impossible to find every line. Amazing exploration game. I cannot wait for the new map which is supposed to be the same size as the first. If you are on the fence and you love skiing/boarding/wingsuit ♥♥♥♥ you will love this game. I have played around 30 hours so far and I am not even close to getting 100% or explored every peak. Not even close to being bored. Oh and the COOP is sooo sick.

												I bought this game before first update and tbh it got bored quickly, but now with Alaska update, there are so many terrains, new houses, rails, contests to mess around with, and less stones as well (but perhaps more trees in some areas). Anyways now the price isn't as steep as before.I don't think it's a must have for full price, but if you got money and maybe got tired of run & shoot this game might be fore you.And GoPro Cam View is mindblowing! I made a wingsuit montage replay with it.

												This is going to be a review of great length, of mixed feelings, of ups and downs, and of hopefulness. It will go chronologically from the beginning to the end (at the time of posting) of my experience with the game.First off, I have snowboarded for a good portion of my life. I started more than 5 years ago and have loved it ever since. I've snowboarded in Utah and Colorado every year since I first experience how fun winter sports are. In terms of this game, I've played it during two of its private testing phases, as well as the final public testing phase. Although I only have 11 hours in the game at this time, in reality I have played steep more than double that amount of time. I have gold-medaled almost every challenge on almost every mountain except the Matterhorn and Mont Blanc, and you will soon discover why this is the case. Originally I intended on reviewing this game after gold-medaling all of the challenges, but I was tomahawking down the Matterhorn when I realized that it was time.Now, to the review.The tutorial is fine. Having played the game before, I was annoyed that it was mandatory, but it ended with relative swiftness and I was able to be on my way. It was useful for the uninformed, and fast enough not to discourage those that know what they're up to. The first locations I played around in were the lower mountains. These are my favorite places to play this game. The physics and controls (ironically) work best in areas of less steep terrain. The game is relaxing, the lighting is beautiful, and it's a playground for skiing and snowboarding. PIllow fields are fun to jump around in, there are alpine forests to hike through on foot or shoot through on snowboard/skis. Around the peaks you can find wonderful routes to paraglide, and you can wingsuit through trees and powerlines for an adrenaline rush. There are plenty of cliffs to ski down and plenty of rooftops to jump off of. I even managed to jib a tree, which honestly might be my personal favorite accomplishment so far in my experience with the game. I love the lower mountains because they are enjoyable. After sufficiently leveling up to gain access to the more ""challenging"" (but in actuality more frustrating) mountains, I had my foray in those as well. Peak of the damned was difficult, but I enjoyed myself for the most part. I damned some of the challenges for reasons I will soon mention. One of my first (minor) gripes with this game was noticed here. Some of the challenges you do reset your ambiance (basically, the lighting and mood of the game world) to what seems to be a predetermined mode. This is annoying and cannot be tampered with. Giving the player the power to change the ambiance of the game and then wresting that control from them at certain points in the game is something I would like to be able to opt out of. The Matterhorn is where my feelings for this game take a turn. The Matterhorn is the epitome of the difference between something that is HARD and something that is CHALLENGING. Peak of the Damned was challenging for me. I had plenty of goes at the challenges before I got gold, but I never felt like they were impossible (save one challenge that, in hindsight, was foreshadowing of what was to come). On the other hand (or ski), the Matterhorn was simply hard. The challenges given to you are nigh-impossible. I don't say that because I couldn't do them. I gold-medaled a good portion of them; however, I did so after crashing over and over, hiking up the mountain to reach checkpoints, and skiing down when I could.The Matterhorn is supposed to be extreme, but I don't believe it's designed to frustrate you. I don't believe it would frustrate you if the game played as the game should play. Ah, the meat and potatoes of the argument. The game does not function as it should.Rocks are like lava. If you run into a rock going 40 mph, of course you should crumble. That's realistic. What isn't realistic (and is instead extremely frustrating) is wiping out because you skiied over a 15 foot stretch of smooth rock/ice on the face of a mountain, and your knees gave out like they were remotely detonated. Switching direction of travel requires two thumbsticks to be pushed in opposite directions. Why is it, then, that as I slide down the side of the Matterhorn Jeremy-Jones style so as not to crash, with the left thumbstick pointing back and the right thumbstick untouched, that my rider decides to change direction?Winguiting is fun as all hell. Nothing is wrong with it. Paragliding is fun as all hell. Nothing is wrong with it. I'm sure I could play another hour of the game and encounter more of my forgotten gripes with this game, but I think I've made a point. The game has SO much potential. It's already the best game on PC that has ever been made in the snowsports genre. If the phyics are fixed, the G-force system is rewired, and unrealistic ways of dealing with real-world occurences are done away with, this game will kick ♥♥♥. I'll still be playing the game after this review is published, but I'm going to spend a lot less time on the more harsh mountains. They would be fun if the game was built to handle them, but untill all of the game mechanics are fixed to allow CHALLENGING descents on the harsher mountains, not FRUSTRATING ones, I'll be spending my time cruising through some low-elevation powder. If there's anything in this review that I seem to have missed and/or totally screwed up on, please notify me so I can take care of it.TL;DR: If you want to cruise through powder, fly adrenaline-pumping wingsuit routes, and enjoy the beauty of the mountains, buy the game on sale. It's the best there is at the moment. If you're looking to descend mountains that no one would descend in real life, I wouldn't recommend it. You won't want to descend them in-game either.			"

												I am enjoying the game so far. Cool things I like about this game:-Online multiplayer is very smooth, which is fairly uncommon in most games these days. Very slick partying up-If you are creative, there are a bunch of crazy lines for the four base sports(sking, boarding, wingsuit, paragliding-Moving around the mountain is just a press of a button, no load times :)-Satisfaction at a smooth run/drop-Replay function looks good-You can spectate people you are in a group with! That is fun, to watch them attempt stuff on your challengeCool things my buddy and I have done in online play:-Skiing down a hill, we spot a lookout point. Unlock it and instantly spawn there so we can paraglide across a lake to a little cottage overlooking a biiiig drop. Proceed to wingsuit drop from the edge of the cottage, scraping our feet on the take-off, and whip out a challenge which my friend scored big on(I biffed a lot)-Spawned most of the up the big peak, and then went on a hike up the ridge to the most summity summit in the game, and used that as a drop point for all the sports.-Scoot down a hill taking turns setting the line, and stumble across the mother of all wingsuit drops, through a series of tunnels, mostly straight downBefore you buy:-DLC includes game content, including new sports. That is a serious bummerd-Controls are not like SSX Tricky, and the tricks/speed are sorta realistic "

												Bad mechanics and very annoying sound track (some songs are ok I guess). An action sport game. Very unreliable trickablity. To a certain extent it really just becomes luck. My character will randomly start hovering and I can't control them till they wipe out. Also I get yanked off of ramps and kickers, and some times even off a whole mountain face. I think its a problem with the game trying to be realistic and sorta unpridictable, however it just kills some of the realisum, its alittle to out of your control some times. I do, however enjoy the game its kinda like skate. It really is far from a great game but has a certain charm and playability. I bet with updates it will get better. Not worth full price though. I would give it 3.4 out of 5 stars.			"

												Great games, epic graphics overall good gameplay. Missions are cool and this type of extreme snow games were dead untill finally Ubisoft came up with an AWESOME game. I've played the Beta and was dying to get my hands on steep today (release date Dec, 2nd). Ive played it on beta for 22 hours and now at the point im writting this review another 10. Game pad is also great in the game and the fact that its open world 24/7 and its so easy to gather up with people makes me rate this game 8/10. ITs awesome with friends.Recommended.			"

												This game is amazing. The graphics are great and all the sports are so fun to play (except mabey paragliding). If you have friends who have this game, it will be even more fun. The challenges are hard but rewarding and the items that you can unlock make you want to grind the game even more. The only thing that I would say bad about the game is the price. I would say if they made it £29.99 then lots more people would be willing to get it straight away. But that shouldn't be a problem soon in a couple weeks since the price will probly go down in the Christmas Sale.This is why im giving this game a nice 9.5/10			"

But i really do recommend you to play with a controller to get better feeling.

												Love this game. Remind me Tony Hawk games when you must do one challange 50 and more time to master it. That is because i love it. - Addictive !!! i did one challange 2 hours till i master wingsuit :D now bite me Steep :)- Graphic is pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (o.r.g.a.s.m)- Hard challenges, not for whiners (so many in review, cry about difficulty :D)- Controls are moderate but it can be learn ... (again crying about something that is just on your brain to learn)P.S.: half of reviews are bad because they think game is overpriced ... it is AAA title so ... what you expected?If you dont want to pay that price dont pay it but dont write negative review ...

												 Steep is the Best winter sports related game of its kind.You can choose from : Snowboard, Ski, Wingsuit, ParaglideBasically its game where you ride, fly down the mountain, and challange other players, or BOTs, there are many races from difficulties such as : Easy, Medium, Hard. There are 4 categories : Freeride, Freestyle, Explorer, and Bone catcher.Each of these categories have its kind of races.As almost every game it have its own easter eggs such as : Rabbids, Far Cry Primal, ''I Love You'' sign on ice etc..It is really adrenaline to play this game, you can do many tricks on snowboard, ski, and even on parachute.For completing races you can recieve new skis, clothing, helmets, glasses, snowboards, wingsuits and parachutes.I would recommend you playing this amazing game, i never played this kind of game so iam amazed about it, i think you will be amazed too if you will get the chance to play it ! :P.

OMG, think if you could buy a lodge to hang with your friends (just for fun).*Grinding.*NPC's, today the game is pretty dead (alone with max 3 people).The game is awesome but a little too easy. :) "

												Having followed this game since I saw it unveiled on an E3 stream, I was eager to try it out. I tested it when the open beta was released on Steam and I wasn't disappointed in the slightest, the game hadn't visually changed much at all since it's unveiling, yet the actual experience of playing it myself was very different to watching someone else doing so, and I spent a good few days grinding out the available challenges alongside my friends and generally enjoying the free roam aspect of the game. Of course, as a beta it wasn't without it's strange behaviour and minor bugs but I had expected that, despite the inconvenience at times.  I had a good while to decide on whether the experience was worth spending money on for the full game and later, after christmas day, I decided I'd indulge myself and buy the game proper.Getting down to brass tacks about the finished product I can tell you that the game, once again, still hasn't made much of a change since the beta. In fact, I was kind of disappointed in how little had been done since then on account of a fresh new set of bugs and what seemed to be barely, if any tweaking to the games mechanics, thankfully the biggest change I could see was a tweaking of the G-Force system which I'll explain a little bit later on. Overall, Steep is a fun, open world experience with a charm that other snowy, mountainous sports games from memory seem to not manage to pull off in quite the same way. Initially, the game is set up to treat you like some kind of extreme sports rising superstar in generic fashion and, to be honest, I found it to be a lot more distracting from the overall experience of the game, since when you're out and about freeroaming and not partaking of the countless public challenges that dot interesting routes across the map, you can really take in the beauty of the sun shining on fresh snow, with a good ambient track to fill the silence, much like you probably would if you went skiing in the alps on holiday in real life. However, if you're not like me, the game is not without it's own soundtrack, comprised of a small selection of premade, dynamic playlists of a few genres that suit the game's setting and theme, in particular, I found it amusing to be cruising down a mountainside, weaving in and out of some blue glacier outcroppings glistening in the late afternoon sunlight to some almost zen like music only to hit a bump and smash my pretty face against one, the track throwing itself off and fading out while dusted myself off and shook myself back into reality, only to fade back in once I'd sorted myself out and got back underway, quickly dropping me back into the game before I could think of booking a much needed appointment at the nearest alpine dental practice.The free roam aspect really is the meat and potatoes of the game, it's clear to anyone that the developers spent most of their time building the game around this, as you can waste a few hours simply travelling from one range to the next, finding new routes to experiment with or simply to enjoy the view, both of which can be customised by the option of changing the position of the sun or the ambience of the weather. Riding down the same mountainside in dark fog is a very different experience to doing the same in clear, cold sunlight! This is not to say that travelling around the map is a slow and laborious process, as you're given the ability to teleport between preset locations at will with the option of discovering many more along the way and, once you've unlocked the ability to do so, you can choose to teleport via helicopter to any part of the map you choose. For those hardcore masochists, if instant and near seamless travel is not your thing, you could spent a whole heck of a lot more time trying to walk back up the mountain if you're willing. Another aspect to the game is the flighty side - wingsuiting and paragliding. Of the four sports in the game, wingsuiting appeals to me the most, it is by far the fastest and most intense way to travel in the game, requiring fast reflexes and precognition if you don't want to turn into alpine pâté. Paragliding is the opposite: a much slower, more relaxed method of travel best for taking in the views while you sail along the mountainside.For those that like to spend a little time tailoring their online image, Steep offers a few preset, voiced riders, all of which play in the same manner, but a LOT of clothing combinations for you to spend time deciding on. Some of the costumes you can get are incredibly amusing the first time you fly off a mountain or sail past someone, taunting them like a squeaky toy or a Yeti as they faceplant repeatedly.Now, this game isn't perfect. In fact, in friendly competition, I've had more than a couple of colourful words to say about some of the mechanics of this game, most namely the G-Force system, which for a game that has a fairly comprehensive tutorial at the beginning, does absolutely nothing to explain, leaving it up to mere speculation as to the finer details of how it works. This mechanic can be downright infuriating if you're a completionist like I am as it makes your job of nailing a perfect jump or getting a race time down to an extremely fine margin a living nightmare. You WILL notice what I'm talking about simply through the course of the game. Heading down a steep slope before mounting a ramp for a jump, if you so much as tap your board or skis on the tiniest bump before reaching that ramp, you can say goodbye to your legs and spine, and enjoy your new diet of your own teeth and liquid hospital food, and a lot of the challenges are purposefully set in locations that have these hazards, adding a level of difficulty that sometimes isn't even related to the challenge you're trying to do. Trust me on this one, it sounds part and parcel for a mountain game but you'll see what I mean when you have to retry the same challenge over and over and over again. It really does test your patience in certain places.Aside from this intentional yet seemingly unreasonable mechanic, the few other cons I have with this game are rather unintentional. This game is, for some reason, an online-only game, meaning you CANNOT play offline or, that if you have sub-par internet like I do, you can run into a few annoying issues such as lack of other players that are supposed to dynamically appear and disappear around you when in range. (A feature of the game, but a sort of psuedo matchmaking or instancing system), making the game rather lonely and desolate at times, with only the annoying narrator shouting generic motivation to their supposedly biggest bread winner over the radio every now and then. This is tied with the games current instability, for example, occasional but random freezing that happens in game, usually at critical moments where you're at high speed, mid air pulling off a trick, or in the middle of winning a difficult challenge. It doesn't last for long, but it seems to be reported as happening to a lot of the playerbase, as well as all the friends I know that have played it.All of that said, I don't regret buying Steep, I can sit and play it for a few minutes to pass the time or a few hours and still come away feeling like it was a worthwhile use of my spare cash. My advice to those reading this far into this review is thus: Do NOT buy this at full price. I got it on the christmas sales and it was an adequate price for what I consider to be a better than average game.I think of Steep as a relaxing, elaborate time waster, a calm immersive experience set aside from my usual library of carnage and mentally engaging games. Sure, there is an element of challenge to this game, it can be brutally unfair to you a lot of the time but if you keep your cool on those icy slopes, you'll find yourself enjoying the stunning vistas, fantastic sound effects and a surprisingly long lasting (yet not quite fully polished) ride down some impressive mountain ranges.

												(Posted on 1/2/17) level 11 as I write this review, so review is still in progress other than Pros/Cons(1/3/17 edit): Now level 13, and would like to update my review (I will mark new pros/cons with the word ""edit"")This is probably one of the best snow-sport games I've played in a long time. I remember back when Shawn Whites Snowboarding came out and thinking it was absolutely amazing. Nothing really seemed to top that game for me, not even SSX, but this game definetely takes the cake. Ubisoft has done an amazing job on this game, though I wish that they had advertised it more, because it definetely deserves more attention than it is getting.Pros:-Large open world to explore-Variety of different activities to do (i.e: Snowboarding, Skiing, Wingsuit/Base Jumping, Walking)-A lot of customizability in what your character wears and the equipment he/she has-Amazing visuals (i.e: realistic looking snow, rocks, particles, etc...)-Real life products (i.e: Red Bull, GoPro, etc...) if you really care about that sort of thing-Great song playlists that vary from ""Chill"" to ""Electro"", ect...-Replay feature that allows you to go back and watch your most recent ride, even in slow motion-Not too many bugs from what I can tell-Has PS4 & Xbox controller compatability-(edit) Very well optimized for PC from my experience (cannot speak for others)-(edit) Microtransactions aren't all up in yo face constantly (meaing you can get by just fine without paying for microtransactions)Cons:-World has borders which makes it feel small at times-$60 price point, may not be all that worth it for some people + a $20 season pass with 3 DLC's already in the works-Game requires internet connection-Wonky keyboard controls-Checkpoints in races are a bit buggy at times (i.e: riding through them but it not registering that you did) which can be quite annoying-(edit) There are microtransactions (despite my pro, microtransactions are cancer in general)Current Rating:7.5/10*I will edit this review in the coming days if I feel the need to*			"

												First my specs:My old rig still runs even the latest games extremely well.Nvidia GeForce GTX 760Intel Core i7 CPU 860 @ 2.80Ghz to 3.46 GHz (Released 2009!!)20GB RAM (Old DDR3 1066/1333!!)1920x1080 Monitor @ 60HzMicrosoft Windows 10 Home EditionI prefer to use an old xbox 360 wireless controller, but the keyboard and mouse are also acceptable here.Graphics: I discovered that by not using the GeForce Experience ""Optimize"" function, and instead using the in-game autodetect feature, I get much better FPS/better looking/higher graphics settings.  VSync on/off had no real impact.Initially, I thought the environment was empty and very limited.  No other players to see or interact with.  It is a HUGE mountain range and you are free to roam anywhere.  Your only limitation when you start is you are level 1 and can't see/use everything available just yet.  I started to wonder if a refund was in order and if all the negative press about Ubisoft was true.  After roaming around and getting a feel for it, I reached level 2 and all of those feelings of dispair and uncertainty melted away as the world around me suddenly sprang to life.  The difference was like night and day and it was astonishing.  Steep was slowly preparing me for what I was about to exprience.  The scenery, physics, music, control, customization options are stunning.  I see others around me now and we join each other in this amazing winter playground.  Not a ton of people, but just enough to make the social aspect satisfying and not overbearing.I can't even begin to describe the fun I'm having playing this and I know writing too much will prevent customers from reading this.  My advice?  Buy it.  It's a nice change from all the violence and such associated with most games today and it's very relaxing.  Absolutely brilliant.			"

												Steep is a great game.At first I have to admit that I was blown away by the open-world and the mountains themselves (I worked on Mt.Blanc for many years) but quite disapointed with the maniability of the game. The controls felt clunky and it took a while to get used to the system.Having 4 sports to choose from really puts the game on another level. I really enjoyed exploring the map by paragliding around and found the windsuit exhilirating. Skiing is quite fun but snowboarding definitly takes the medal and after a few hours of gameplay it becomes pretty obvious that Steep was directly inspired but the S.K.A.T.E. Series. It is much either though and I will be hoping that Steep 2 will be a bit harder.Pros:Open WorldReal mountains4 Sports to choose fromMultiplayer unexpectedly funScoring system (freeride/freestyle/extreme)Cons:Trick system too assisted and too easyNo real career modeGear is only estheticMusic tracks will change if you reset your characterIMPROVEMENT IDEASA better trick system: The actual controls are too permissive. Since there is a lot of S.K.A.T.E. In this game, well go full distance and emphasise more on the analog sticks. Make tricks harder, add a trick list, make landing more intuitive and less assisted.Snowmobile: open flat areas would be perfect playgrounds for the snowmobile, that can have it's on trick system. In multiplayer mode you could pull other players behind you.Kickers: Build your own jump. Define the size, angle and slope. You could gain speed by being pulled by another player on a snowmobile. Kickers can be used for taking off and landing.Snowline: Area walls, really? The best wall in this game would be... no snow. The ground at the bottom of the mountains are bear of snow and grass is appearant. No frozen lakes but water. Rivers could come out of glaciers around this altitude.Punitive bails: You fall off a cliff and only K.O? Respecting the mountain means understanding how dangerous it can be. Show the broken bones of the crashed player model, make them loose a bit of money or make heir gear show damage!Snow conditions/Avalanches: Making people more responsible when they go up the mountain to ride in real life and not get carried away after playing too much Steep by adding a disclamer on the loading screen is not enough. That also has to be implemented in the gameplay. The snow conditions (it's thickness, the max speed it allows, how you can land on it) could change and dangerous areas could appear, creating the conditions for a player to create an avalanche. Other players caught in it would bail but the player that started it would have to take responsibily for other player's demise.Proximity bonus: Having your avatar score points next to a player of your group should add a bonus of share some of the points.Helicopters: Make them flyable! Instead of having am automatic sequence and tickets, why not make a great simulator where you can carry other players around? It would be an end-game unlock.You could have to pay for your fuel and be paid by other players. I know this might sound like I want an Arma version of Steep but having one player pull off a double flip above a helicopter controlled by another player is just too rad.Replay/HUD: Replay mode should be deepened. Static cameras, keyframes, more speed variations, and the possibility to save the replay as a standalone video.That's it for now! I'm going right back into it, if I have more ideas I will probably come and make an edit. Tell me what you think!			"

												So you probably were like me and keep coming back to this games store page thinking, ""Man I would like a really good snowboarding/skiing/wingsuit game for PC! But this game is only ""Mostly Positive""...""  Fear not child, for I have good news.  Steep is a very good game.I LOVED the SSX games.  Have probably a collective 400+hrs in that series. If you are looking for a game like SSX, you will get some of the things you want and some things you don't want out of Steep.  Before I say what these are I just want to say that I realize as I played Steep, that even though I wanted a game like SSX at first, I realized what I really just wanted was a snowboarding game that feels good in it's controls and is confident in what it's trying to be.  Steep is both of those things.You will like: + The CONTROLS feel good.  They are tight and responsive.  You feel in control of what you are trying to do.+ The GRAPHICS are very nice.  Very big and varied enviriontments lush with detail. Lighting is awesome.  Animations are great.  Snow looks better than any other game i've played. Overall awesome atmosphere.+  The SOUNDS are very good. Great soundtrack.  Nothing too specific to mention.  The sounds just do their job well.+ The REPLAYABILITY.  Some people may not be able to sit and play hours worth of this game in a single session (I can because I like exploring).  But regardless, this game has A LOT of challenges to complete.  You wont be done anytime soon.You may not like:-+ The CHARACTERS.  I feel some of the characters and their voices can be a bit dramatic and cringy.  Others are much better at not sounding so ridiculous.  However, some people may like this.  I'm indifferent about it.-+ The PHYSICS.  On the whole, I like them.  However I think that everyone who has played this game can agree that sometime your skiis or snowboard just act kinda ""funny"" when going over a slope or bumping into something. sometimes you remain connected on the ground when it feels like you should've left the ground for a second or two.  Sometimes you just turn to tight or lose momentum when it feels like you shouldnt have.  The thing to remember here is that these instances are rare on the whole and the positive physics experiences outweigh the bad by a considerable amount.-+ The PRICE.  A lot of people keep mentioning the price of this game being too expensive.  I do not agree.  I bought this at $60 and I definitely feel like i've gotten my moneys worth.  However, I seem to be in the minority on that one.  Keep in mind though that if you love snowboarding and skiing games, and love to explore, I dont think the price will bother you.Overall, If you are looking for a great extreme snow sports title I just dont think you can go wrong with Steep.

												Never really been in to any sports game but this certainly changed that. Be aware, if you strive to get all medals gold like me, you'll probably be spending 2 hours or more on 1 race... not like that happened to me or anything....Anyway, good game, fun to meet random people through the seemless multiplayer. Easily traverse through the huge, open landscape with practially zero load times. And the game definitely looks gorgeous, feel free to browse my screenshots of this game if you think otherwise. The snow physics and tesselation are particularly well done and adds a whole layer of immersion in my opinion. Can't wait for the new content through the season pass!			"

												So far, as a skier, this game has been awesome to play. The challenges are fun and you aren't forced to do them. If you want to just go down a hill and do tricks, whether it's for practice or for fun, you are welcome to while still being able to earn XP.Pros:+Great map+Beautiful graphics+Good physics+Awesome soundtrack+Fun challenges+Large variation between what you can do+Multiplayer doesn't suckCons:-The types of challenges can get repetitve (But that's not the point, the map is part of the challenge, which is what makes them great)-Game is still a little buggy.Overall, I would definitley recommend this game to anyone who enjoys snow sports and/or is curious about buying this game.

												Steep's a great game - but not without its flaws. The multiplayer system could be tweaked, or at least players should be informed about how it works. I was puzzled when I first started playing, with players dropping in and out of the world seemingly randomly. The tricking system could be a little more refined too. But apart from a few minor gripes, I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone with an interest in snowsports or skating games as the mechanics are quite similar.			"

												I am biased as this is the first game primarily made by Ubisoft Annecy, my hometown. It is not one of the best in tricks-based snowboarding, especially compared to SSX. It is more of a pure winter sports/mountaineering game. Playing steep brings back memories of my own skiing, obviously not completely true to life, but containing enough little touches you can really feel there at times. The chalets are convincing, as are the pine forests, and the crunch of the snow when you're on foot is perfect when you're stuck in a snowless piece of ♥♥♥♥ city and longing for the mountains of home.I realize I am getting tacky and dramatic, but Steep put me in the mood for that. See, above all, though, it is a gushing love letter to the mountains and winter sports, and it is impossible not to like it when you're a boy of these regions.Is the midnight ride with a personnification of the Pointe Percée chanting the wonders of the mountains a bit tacky ? Yes. But tacky and overly passionate is a rarity in current year's video games. It's made by mountaineers, for mountaineers, and it shows.It is not exempt of faults by a long shot. The physics are often pretty ♥♥♥♥ed, there are no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ski lifts when they should be shaping the landscape, the places named in reference to the real Alps have pretty much nothing to do with reality (though in regards of the refuge de leschaux, putting a traditional chalet was more tasteful than the real thing), the tricks system is awkward and a bit too restrictive, and the snowing effects are tame. But the game set out to make a game where you're free to ♥♥♥♥ around the mountains as you please, and by all accounts it succeeds at it. It even dares being very well optimized, with smooth 60 fps and barely any load times even when teleporting.			"

												Finally a new sports game that comes to PC. Steep is beautiful, it's massive, and it's straight up relaxing. A little frustrating with challenges, but enough to leave you satisfied when completing them. I prefer skiing to snowboarding, however the tight trails really make you lean more towards the snowboarding side. The views are absolutely gorgeous at times, and being able to change the time of day and ambiance really spices up the immersion. I highly recommend this game if you find relaxation in sliding down a giant snowy mountain. Don't think you're going to be pulling off SSX tricks though because that's not happening. I spent the first few hours learning how to play, the next few admiring the scenery, and the last couple trying to be competitive. Now that's the good stuff about Steep. Am I going to say there isn't stuff that bothers me? of course not. There is a bunch of things that bother me, just not enough to rant about and hate the game. Physics could be fixed, but I believe Ubisoft can fix these things soon enough as nothing is game breaking.Thanks for a solid game, Ubisoft. 8.5/10			"

												Honestly, with only under 2 hours of gameplay for Steep I can't say much, but I can definitely say that Steep is a great game. Beautiful Graphics, Beautiful (ish) controls, Beautiful Gameplay with an infinite number of things to do, whether it be gliding, parachuting, skiing, snowboarding, or playing Co-op with your friends. The map is very Open-World with endless snow parks and places for you to do epic tricks, and big enough that you might never find all the locations. That usually means this game is good.However... The game does depend on a continous internet connection. Which ruins the game for me as I have to redo whatever challenge I was playing Every 20 Minutes because Steep automatically boots you back to the loading menu as soon as your internet goes wrong, for me, this happens a lot, and unfortunately warrants a refund for unplayability. it also extends the loading time for the game longer than other games (even the ones that also require internet connections) since it's played like an MMO. However, if you have a good, steady PC with great connection, than you should definitely get this game and play it.I'm conflicted about giving it a 'Yes Recommendation' for the greatness of the game itself or a 'No Recommendation' Because my experience with it wasn't the best.

The gameplay and the sports available without the (yet to be released) DLC are really great and every single one controlls like how you expect them to control (PERFECTLY).  I think that you have more than enough missions and a whole lot of space to explore and play in with community made tracks.  For me this is one of the best sport games that has come out in the last years and the best snow sports game that has ever been released. If you ever wanted to play a snow sport game this is the one you should get.10 / 10- Hope Ubisoft keeps up the good releases.			"

												Steep is incredibly lackluster. If you like mindlessly hitting 'challanges' on repeat until you get a gold medal which provides with a boring skin, you may like this game.The fall physics is a source of frustration. Falling and unable to get up on your own while going down a gentle slope during a race is an instant reset. There are many points in the game that your character will get stuck and it will just stop the challange because you literally can't move. The repetition and junk rewards ruined what could have been an amazing game.After playing many other snowboard games for years, this is the first one that made me not want to go out and snowboard.No Man's Sky gives a bigger rush than this.Here's an example of the fall physics:

												So far so good. Plays very nicely with barely any performance hiccups. Game runs flawlessly completely maxed out including 8x MSAA anti-aliasing method. Graphics look ""ok"" but nothing mind-blowing. Load times are insanely fast allowing you to just re-start events after falling in an instant and allowing you to teleport to the top of the mountain to try a different path all that much easier. Exploration is key and the game really doesn't hold your hand after the tutorial and let's you play it your way. Very large map, lots of customization options, a seemless online multiplayer experience and an overall great game. Highly recommend if you're a fan of snowboarding games. This is MUCH better than Shaun White Snowboarding or that trash-heap ""Snow"" indy game.For more in-depth review, check out my video review. It's processing atm but should be ready soon.

												I played 17 hours worth of this game on open beta and I didn't finish what I could of done, so theres a lot of play time. Ghrapics are great and well optimized in my opioion. Only problem im having on release is with using my xbox one controller, kinda broken but hopefully there will be a fix. That shouldn't stop you from playing this game because it works pefectly with a keyboard and mouse, xbox 360 contoller, and ps4 controller as far as I know.			"

												At first I was unsure about this game, it looked amazing on paper but when I opened it up I thought 'huh the snowboard and wingsuit aren't as indepth as I'd hoped'. Quickly realised that I couldn't have been more wrong. I don't think exploring vast (seriously enourmous) mountains and valleys will ever get old, I don't think I'll ever get tired of watching my friend take a 3000 g-force hit to the cranium and laughing at him. Can be both serious and silly, but is fun regardless.Fully recommend this game, it plays like a passion project, not a standard Ubisoft cash-grab. (Bonus enjoyment if you loved the SSX series on the PS2, you'll love this bad boy).			"

												If your a big fan of extreme sports games there's nothing like it in this era of gaming. There has not been an extreme sports game like it ever. Even though Tony Hawk Pro Skater 5 came out in 2015 it wasn't that good and the controls felt unnattural compared to the previous titles. And the game didn't even come out for PC but that's a good thing because console peasants understand what a bad port feels like. I have Tony Hawk Pro Skater HD and it's terrible everything about it. We haven't got an SSX game in a while probably 10 years. And we need to embrace that this is a game that is a spirtual successor to SSX Tricky and Tony Hawk Pro Skater. When this game first came out of course with Ubisoft the controls are not gonna be up to par and network connectivity wasn't going to be the best. That's with every Ubisoft game that comes out for open beta and even full release. Ubisoft did great with Shaun White Skateboarding. I had it for the Wii and the controls were excellent, it's replayability was awesome and it had personality.I got for PC last June and I love the game I just hated how it lacked the option to use a controller. But it was still good. I'm Glad that Ubisoft didn't ♥♥♥♥ it up compared to the studio that made the last Tony Hawk Games. This game has excellent controls,personality, it runs well and looks gorgeous. It doesn't need a beefy system to run games on high settings at 1080p. It's not boring and not anything you'll expect from a sports game nowadays and it's being constantly updated and it's way better than the open and closed beta, The unlockables make me feel like I accomplished something and I haven't had that feeling in almost a decade when it comes to video games. The only problem is the price, Don't buy the game only for $60 and the Gold Pack for $100 wait for it to go on sale for the Gold Pack, I bought the Gold Pack for $67 which is like $37 for the game and $30 for the season pass. It adds a bunch of new sports,challenges,characters and costumes for more fun and real playability with friends and strangers online. I almost picked it up on release but I was wise and picked it up while the Gold Pack was on Sale for $67. Theonline is very great and fun depending on the people your playing with of course. I've only played two hours of this game which isn't much but it's an extremely great timekiller for extreme sports finatics. The oionly thing lacking is the soundtrack and the Characters. The music is okay but it can always be better and they could've had extreme sports athletes be characters in the game for more people to be interested. But if your a big extrem sports fan and a big fan of the extreme sports gaming genre this is the best that there's to offer. SSX Tricky fans this is the closest thing to SSX in my book.			"

												The game is very fun although I decided to get a refund as for £40 it is not worth it. People say the gameplay wears thin quickly although I find it thoroughly enjoyable. I would advise buying this if you have a relatively large sum of money available or if it is on offer for a max of £20. Also I think that the gold editiono should be included for £40.			"

												I had my doubts about purchasing this game as the price is quite high for what seems like an experience you can get out of other games like SNOW. But really, this is a really a unique game with quite a steep learning curve (if you are new to extreme sporting games) but the work pays off with a beautiful mountain range with details at every corner. For example the first person mode even has the sounds changed so it feels like a go pro, the snow is dynamic so that even your ski stick will create a change in the terrain. Overall, amazing.Although the multi-player is a bit weird, it always feels epic when you dive off a cliff edge and race a snow boarder down the slopes. Hopefully they will allow the game to be played without an internet connection, but other than that, this game is a solid  9.5/10  "

												With eleven hours in the beta, and about ten and a half more as of this review, I've really been enjoying my Steep experience.        It plays like you’d want it to. The controls have taken some getting used to, but I didn't seem to mind learning because the game does well with challenging at all levels. Steep will definitely be a bit nostalgic for any of the N64 era players as it requires you to learn in depth, albeit simple, controls while just slightly veering into the realm of monotony you’ve probably come to expect from sports games. That aside, this is a good title and it’s worth getting if you enjoy the idea of a fluid extreme winter sport game with some minor (fun) glitches and relatively competitive play. "

												A really fun game if you enjoy winter sports, I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. There are some bugs with the environment but they usually correct themselves. Only problem I have with the gameplay is that only 20% of the challenges you do are actually challenging, the other challenges you can get a gold metal in 2-3 attempts. Overall I would recommend it to anyone who likes this kind of stuff.			"

												Finally an open world snow sports game. Ski/Snowboard/Wingsuit are pretty well dialed in. Some of the controls/physics are a little wonky, but after an hour or so it is easy to get the hang of. I must admit, the paraglide aspect was one I approached with apprehension. I will say, while there is a steep (pun intended) learning curve, it is one of the most rewarding methods of locomotion in the game. Some have criticized individual mechanics of the game, and I agree with some critiques - but overall this is an addiciting game, and I will be playing for years.			"

												Pro: Good game, cool physics. not a sim, not a arcade...the right mix. Con: the price matches the title. its steep. gets a little repetitive for the price. maybe features like snowmobiles, getting to build  your own jumps, a couple more parks, rails, more expansive freestyle ect. would ammount to a $60 title.

												Honestly one of the most beautiful games I've ever played (graphics, gameplay, aethetics) of course you can look past all of that and go into gameplay, which I find to be very fun and enjoyable to learn how to get better. The free roaming aspect of this winter sports/extreme sports game brings a feeling of openess like you are able to do whatever you want and not be held back by a storyline and main missions. You do as you please and have fun. Very proud of Ubisoft, they made a game that has become special to me (the last Ubisoft game that did that way AC Brotherhood). Only major cons I have found or minor graphical glitches and minor gameplay issues which I dont doubt will be fixed in due time. 10/10 I have faith in you Ubi, don't let us down.			"

Lose ALL control while trying to turn sometimes.-The bugs here and there like being sucked down a cliff after jumping over it, clothing page glitching, etc etc.Pros: -Relaxing AF if you aren't doing challenges. Just flying or riding around is a blast.-Really pretty. Great graphics. I'm on a gtx 770 and I have a great time running it.-The character customization is dope. I really enjoy messing around with my style and unlocking more gear through challenges.-The progression and sense OF progressing are really pleasing and make it much more entertaining. -When the tricks and riding work, it's really pleasing and flowy and so much fun.Over all, fun game. 8/10			"

												Remember 1080 Snowboarding and Pilotwings 64, back in the Nintendo 64 days?Imagine if those games had a child that's since grown up, graduated college, and gone into career as a snowboard instructor, ski guru, paraglide expert, and wingsuit enthusiast based out of the Swiss alps. If you've ever played the two games above, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect from this game: blistering motion-planning challenge meshed with solid writing, addictive ""just one more try"" gameplay, and tons of Easter eggs waiting to be found. Blessedly, I've yet to experience the Ubisoft curse of crippling bugs and soulless design in this one. This is a game full of soul, and one that wears its bugs proudly as a sandbox physics game. There _are_ bugs, but none that have yet gotten in the way of gameplay.Downside: the price may be a bit... steep (sorry) for a sandbox game with such a uniform experience. Unless you have an itch to scratch for a good simulator with loads of creative challenges, it's possibly better waiting to pick this one up when it's on sale. "

												SteepThis game is great, but there are so many horrible bugs that sometimes, you want to throw your computer out the window. For example, one time I was doing a race, and out of nowhere, I just fell, and trust me, I did not hit ""R"" (which is the fail button) It has great challenges and is a lot of fun, but it needs a LOT of work			"

												I love this game! the graphics are amazing and the gameplay is amazing (which is hard to find now. It's usually one or the other). I have already played this game for hours, and probably will be for many more. I understand that this game is still in Beta, but developers if you're reading this, there are few bugs that Many people (myself included) have come across. The first one that I found was that, text in the menus would sometimes not appear, but in-game, the text is there but it flickers. The problem I have with this, is that it isn't really ON but flickers OFF. It's more OFF and every couple seconds, it flickers ON for enought time to read half of a word so it's almost impossible to read. The second glitch isn't as bad, but it gets tedious after a while. Every 10-20 minutes, the game crashes, but it still syncs my progress to ""the cloud"", so I'm thinking it's a glitch where it crashes when it uploads your progress. Overall, it's still an amazing game, with a few bugs that are annoying, but not game breaking			"

												I see a lot of people talking about Steep in a really binary way. There are the people who think Steep is trying to be a snowboarding/skiing simulator and argue that it's a realistic game. There are also the people who argue the opposite -- that Steep is trying to be an arcadey game  like the old Tony Hawk games or SSX.To me Steep is neither of those things, Steep is a game that is meant to simulate the *feeling* of skiing and snowboarding. When I'm at the top of some random mountain crest and I pick a line, power through it, and throw in a few nice looking tricks where and when it feels right, I truely get the same feeling I get from actual snowboarding (a mix of adventure and creativity). Likewise when I'm doing some challenge or replaying a race over and over to get that perfect run -- I feel like I'm playing a video game. The beauty of Steep is its ability to toe the line between a fun game and a simulation of something I really enjoy. That is why Steep will be staying downloaded and In my library for a very long time.			"

												not much to do right now.after finishing all the challenges, you might want to spend some time perfecting your scores, until you realize that last millisecond is basically pure luck, alot of cheesing, weird physics glitches or non-registered collisions (just watch the replay on any wingsuit challenge).the community dares are a nice feature, but they are only coming slowly into the game and are badly curated (or maybe thats intentional to make it easy for your first try? guess this would only be solvable with a challenge editor that gives us the same tools the devs use - like different sizes of checkpoints or the ability to move checkpoints. fe: ""I went through the bullseye, but the checkpoint is set 10m before the bullseye, so anyone can just dodge it""-kinda situations.add to that the fact that they seem to change physics on a biweekly basis - have you played vertigo after release? try playing it now, the behavior on steep downhill sections has gotten worse, the only thing that saves it is the fall-buffer they introduced 2 patches ago, so you dont fall immediately when you hit your g-limit - and this is probably a good game to buy in a sale for 20 bucks with dlc included in a year or so.they won't have the game in a perfect state by that point in time - if ever, before the server's shut down - but you'll have PLENTY of items you can buy in the store instead of win by doing challenges...which is also a rather sad state imho.PS: 100% completion on alps, 101% on alaska. 37/38 memorable moments. dont ask me how the 101%-calculation works,  I guess that's ubisoft math ;)			"

												Being the skiier/snowboarder I am, I bought the game with little research. I went on to see what I liked and disliked about it, and I have to say, this is the only sports game I like. From all the other racing games/sports games, you don't have to be good or bad to play. Just get to know the game physics and tricks and you feel like a real pro! The openworld style gives you a lot of freedom, and you unlock new slopes as you go by the game, so when you're at it you don't feel like you need to go higher as you feel good at your current comfort level. The only thing that really dissapointed me was the dlc content. This game is 60.00 USD and I feel like this is a price for a full game, but the DLC offers 3 new sports for 20 more dollars. I find this greedy of Ubisoft, and should atleast have the 3 more sports in the full price. Other than that, great game, hard to find one once in a while.Pros:-Amazing Graphics-Realistic Physics-Good community-Easy to play-Many challenges and endless things to do-Many sports to choose from-In-Game currency which you don't find necessary to earn or worry about-In-Game character customizationCons:-Too high of a price-Repatitive game-Could use a singleplayer-Could use missions, ingame objectives, though there are small ones you can do			"

												I know a lot of people are not happy with the ""repetative"" nature of the game. I will say up front this does not bother me. If you like snowboarding games, you will love this one. It is beautiful. Physics feel great. Doesn't pigeon hole you into set lines. This game definitely has a vast feeling of freedom to it. Only things that I would improve would be:+Moar clothes and equipment!+Moar songs! (Or custom playlists?)+Goggle color effects toggle?Playing with a friend is awesome. If nobody is on, I just screw around and freeride sometimes. I think my longest freeride is like 10min? It is really relaxing.Definitely recommend!

												Although I have not played the game for too long, I believe I have played it enough to write a review about it. So for all of you that are a little bit pushed away by the game's ""steep"" price, this might help you out a little bit.The game is a sports game that is based around skiing, snowboarding, paragliding, and flying in a wingsuit around some big mountains (just in case you haven't figured that out yet). It is made by Ubisoft which is somewhat unfortunate due to the fact that you have to have a UPlay account for the game and Ubisoft is known for its incompetence. Despite that information it is a really solid and fun game. The controls are user-friendly which enhances the experience of dashing down a snow-covered mountain at maximum velocity. For those who have an amazing computer, you will likely find that the graphics are amazing and for those with a relatively bad computer, you will find slightly less amazing graphics, but stil amazing! Basically, the graphics are pretty sick. The gameplay is extremely awesome too (for the most part). Snowboarding and skiing are both the biggest highlights of this game compared to the other two sports to choose from. I guess the wingsuits are okay, but honestly, the paragliding is pretty boring. Despite that, the gameplay is pretty sick and definitely makes you feel like you are actually skiing or snowboarding. This game is great for both sportspeople and gamers a like, which is helpful because it allows for more players and a large variety of players. Although I haven't really done much with the social aspect of the game because none of my friends own this game, the little I have seen of it seems to be pretty solid. One thing that is really cool about the game is that it is an open world game so it feels like you have more freedom to just do what you want. You can either do the challenges or you can just mess around by snowboarding down giant hills or maybe faceplanting into a giant boulder in a wingsuit. The possibilities are almost endless.There really is not a lot to say negatively about this game. The main things that are negative about the game are the paragliding, Ubisoft, and not a lot of stat progression (which really is not a problem for me but it could be for most people). This game also has couple of bugs every now and then which comes with Ubisoft, but those could possibly be worse due to the fact that my computer is not that great.Although the game is some what pricey, it is most definitely worth it on a sale and still worth it even when it is not on a sale assuming you aren't breaking the bank by buying this game.Overview:Pros:1. Great Gameplay2. Great grapics3. Great Open-World4. Fun Challenges5. User-Friendly ControlsCons:1. Pricey2. Ubisoft -_-3. ParaglidingFinal Score | 8/10			"

												This game is not for everyone and to be fair I picked it up at 50% off but honestly I enjoyed my time with it so much I picked up the season pass while it was on sale too. Ultimately like everyone has said the skiing and snowboarding is fairly similar and the hang gliding is boring as hell but the ski/snowboard mechanics and wingsuits are so much fun and as an open world exploration game this is one of the must fun, relaxing, and beutiful experiences I've had. It's more of a Skate style simulator so don't go in expecting ssx tricky or something but if you just want to wast countless hours skiing and snowboarding around the alps and exploring them then you will absolutly have a blast. If your not sure, wait for a sale. It's fun but community interactions are meh so waiting a few months to pick it up is fine, don't wory too much about player base size. I tend to play this like some kind of combination between skate and journy except on a snowboard. If that sounds cool Steep might be worth your time.			"

												I can understand some mixed reviews for this game. Overall the graphics and scenery are stunning, the soundtrack/audio is excellent ( I love the crackling in the fresh powder), and about 99% of the time I enjoy the game aas a whole. I do feel there are some issues, the controls can be annoying (especially when trying to do a speedrun and you want to level your character out but then randomly flips or turns more than wanted) and the similarity of challenges can lead to boredom.  I feel those who have a skiing or snowboarding background will get the most out of this game. I love being able kick back and start a run while listening to the chill music to relax, but I do feel there can be simple additions that make this game so much better and realistic such as being able to ride snow lifts to a drop, being able to ride down to resorts or cabins as in real life and walk around, but overall this game will always be enjoyable whenever I hop on.

												I highly dislike this game. Which is why I love it. Steep is intense; unless you expect to spend hours repeating the same course over and over again, leave and don't come back. The first level took me around 30 minutes to master but after that most of the courses rated Easy wear easy. However, Normal and Hard is a whole different story. This is realistic. There are no save points. A tiny miscalculation can lead to a good amount of time utterly wasted on longer runs. The Normal difficulty is near impossible with anything other than the wingsuit. Just forget about Hard; it is impossible. A tap from a twig in a massive forest will require you to start over from the beginning as the AI does not make mistakes. Checkpoints, which are only on some levels, are painful to succeed in (exhibit A: just spent 2 hours on a Normal difficulty level and did not ever make passed more than half of the checkpoints; the majority of the time I only made the first two). Wingsuit is fun, after you master it and skis become decent after sometime. However, snowboarding is very non responsive in terms of tricks and the other one (parachute or something like that) is just plain boring. The visuals are immersive and vivid which is a big part of the game. It is very fun to explore and just mess around with friends but serious single player is brutal (the feeling you get when you finally win through luck makes up for the pain). Overall, I recommend the game for playing with friends but not at the full price.Enjoyment - 80/100Replayability - 100/100Community - 90/100Graphics - 100/100Developers - 90/100 (I heard Ubisoft is behaving on this one)Pricing - 50/100Finished Product - 90/100Grand Total - 86/100If this seems negative, I just spent about 2 hours on one level repeating it around 40-50 times and have not yet finished it once; I actually like the game but we have a love/hate relationship.

												I bought this game during the winter sale. I saw all the negitive reviews about the price, the tricks, the glitches, everything. And I still bought it like an idiot.And I love it.

It's a fantastic, fluid game with a good soundtrack, a hard as nails trick system that airs on the side of realism, and a fun social element to it that a lot of games just don't have.I am a huge Skate fan and I can see all of the obivious influences here, from the camera to the trick system. If you want Skate but in an SSX shell, get this. You won't be disappointed.The price is a bit sharp and the DLC's they plan on releasing is another case of ""Why Didn't You Put This In Here In The First Place Ubisoft"". Also if I put a full mask on a character, it clips through the face and causes a huge black dancing shadow that is super districating to show up and it's really annoying.But to be honest, I can deal with the flaws.

It sports a massive open world which the player is free to explore by skiing, paragliding, wingsuiting and snowboarding, by themselves or with friends. There are also many races and challenges one can also do by themself, or against friends. Graphics look amazing, and the game's loading times are practically non existent in game - you can instantly teleport from one mountain to another in one click. The switching of sports is also very seamless, meaning you can be snowboarding one moment, then wingsuiting the next. Highly recommended!			"

SNOW took me roughly 20 to 30 hours to get the mechanics down pretty smooth and true, its hard to do the same with this game due to the spin restriction if you do not have enought air for the trick.

I can basically enter any medium challenge and get gold first try now, regardless of what it is while when starting out it was a real challenge. You get used to the game. You get used to the trick system. You get used to g-force meter. It just takes a bit of time. As a VERY impatient person, who managed to figure it out and git gud, what's your excuese?

												I invested in the game and season pass while it was on sale during winter; I payed around 60 dollars, an amount I usual refrain from spending on any game.  The reason I did this was so that I could have a relaxing game that is a break from my usual competitive, intense game.  Some may believe that Steep doesn't have much content, but then the game is not for them.  This game lets the player enjoy another world and admire the beauty of nature and specificly the snowy mountains.  This game isn't for a lot of people, but I know I will enjoy it for a long time.

												Well.. I wish I just could write a review sooner.. But I was really busy playing the game.To me the game is made for chilling. I just go in and spend hours without noticing.Here's what my thoughts are by the means on pros and cons;Pros:1-Game is fun, whatever you do paraglide/snowboard/skii/wingsuit, doesn't matter. Game will always stun you with it's beautiful views and somehow interesting story at times.2-It doesn't force you to do missions at all, if you are bored; go around and explore, pull of stunts and share your great moments with players, dare them to a challenge!3-Map is huuuuuuge. Yeah, it's not huge. It's what you call huuuuuuge. There are places I yet to explore, but so far all I can say is that the game haven't let me down yet.4-Despite it's being only online, you can send party invites (i still haven't figured how to accept the invites though) and play with your friends, or make new friends by randomly sending invites. Don't hesitate, people always like to share good moments!5-You are not obliged to follow mission's trails (well... except it's a checkpoint one). You can always pick up new routes to achieve what the mission says, do whatever you feel like, and just have fun out there!Cons:1-Game is a bit expensive, even in winter sale, but it just gives back what it takes from you so it's not a loss at all. For me at least.2-Some stunts and tricks are really hard to pull off with keyboard, so in my opinion, it'd be better to play it with a controller.3-As I stated above, I still couldn't figure how to accept the party invites I've got. I looked up for any leads, but people claim that G key works both when you are about to send a party invite or accept it. For me, if it's working, it's 10 seconds later or around. I hoped they would make it more clear so we could actually accept the invites. So far that's all I've countered. Thanks for reading till the end.I heartily rate this game 10/10*hands a cookie*Have fun y'all!			"

												DudeZ' - I have a love-hate feeling towards Ubisoft... On one hand I personally find that they in recent times have provided one of the most diverse ranges of games: from The Crew [driving] - to Far Cry - Watch Dogs - to titles like Steep [wintersport]. And each of these... they've paved partly new parths and not gone the 'given road' like emulating ""Need for Speed"" or ""Call of Duty"" etc etc. In one word: Creativity. Perhaps because of the mix of European and Canadian lead studios. At least I see for good and for bad a distinct French' tone in both game-art and game-concept as well as in the attitude towards the customer.So: Steep? Well, lets say that my background isnt beeing a total ski-freak. But still, I've done recreational alpine skiing since I was 8-9years old, and while I studied at University I took a stint not as ski-guide but as Ski-destination guide. Which pretty much means skiing after-hours 4-7 hours day for 3-4 months :- ] Sweet.AnyWho. Steep is just about as close as I've been able to get to ""the real thing"" while not getting my butt' cold!The feel when you'r carving your turns and try to nail the rythm... aaaah.... its juuuuust about the point where you forget you'r gaming and find yourself back in memory, carving slops in the Alps, Scandinavia or Russia.Now, I have issues. Mainly w. Ubisoft having deplorable customer-service, especially re. The Crew [their english staff - man, talk about trying to disencourage returning customers to the brand]. However, Steep - > This one has really turned my opinion about Ubi':  No sneaky micro-transactions that mar' many other brands these days. NO - instead: ""Hey Dudez: Here's a FREE Expansion just about 1/3 of the TOTAL GAME"". Sure enough, the game prissy-boys cry about that's theres not this or that extra glitter on their free lollypop. But hey - that's humanity for 'ya :- ]ENJOY this one - I sure did and am still doing.If you'r into snowboarding more than traditional skiing, then you might prefer other titles. But to me, that they add snowboard, wingsuit, paragliding (sweeeeet) etc. Well, thats fine. If I dont like it, it doesnt hurt my JOY in my preferred core-part.Trick-parks' - there isnt such in particular. And there's plenty of crying about this in the comments. Well, be a little creative my teenage-teddybear-huggers ;- )  Try fx. the ""Whale Bone Yard"" at Alaska. There's grinding for ya' if thats what your after.... Personally I dont use 5min.s on the ""challenges"" in the game - I just free-ride my sweet way for an hour and am happy as a squirrel whos found a pair of king size hooters' ;- ] Btw:  I do professional sports [extreme-sports] and ironically I've not been able to ski for about 10years. The risk of ruining my knees and thus my income is too high especially since I love off-piste and especially taking 'stupid' risks. Now I can live out that part of my persoality - without the RiSk - YaY :- ]]/Dr. Mabuse, aka Angry Viking.www.worldrun.org "

												The health system and trick system aren't properly explained at all. It's not SSX. Your're not screaming down the mountain busting out dumb combos and besides landing as smoothly as possible you HAVE to be sure to cut momentum to restore health. There are also tweaks to grabs that will greatly boost your trickscore. Other than their failure to explain those core systems, the game is great. Just skiing around the mountain feels amazing. The wingsuit offers pure hilarity and the paragliding is a peaceful ride.			"

												If you liked EA Skate series, you will prolly like this game.Lot of reviewers are missing the point. WAB was complaining that you cant pull a parachute out your ♥♥♥ like in Just Cause 3 and all that stuff.This game is trying to mimic snowboarding in a arcade/realistic way, similar how Skate did skateboarding.I like these types of sports so im really liking this game so far. Snowboarding and skiing is the best part, but gliding around with the chutes is not bad either.Controls are pretty good even on keyboard, but Im sure the best experience is with controller. But again, im playing with KB and its all good.Game looks amazing.""Story"" is ♥♥♥♥ but thats to be expected.Its an Ubisoft game so it has microtransactions for outfits.			"

												This game is not bad at all. The snowboarding/skiiing/wingsuiting is really fun! My personal opinion is that paragliding is incredibly boring, but once again, my personal opinion. It's fun to turn on a podcast or listen to some music and just screw around in this game. But with all good games must come some bad things. While Steep is an incredibly fun game that I do recommend, it does require a constant internet connection and cannot be played offline. I feel like this would be an easy fix to just add an offline mode but I guess the devs aren't feeling it. So while it is my only complaint with this game, it is a pretty major one and I do hope it gets fixed somewhere in the near future.8/10 ""When snow falls, nature listens"" -Antoinette Van KleeffAnd all that nature hears is the screams of agony as you tumble down a mountain.

I don't recommend this game to the average gamer for 3 reasons: 
-$79.99 (CAD)-There is no campaign-Playing with a m + kb is atrociousThat being said,  this game is definitely better than SSX, Shaun White Snowboarding, SNOW or whatever other snowboarding or skiing games are out there; and if you are a hardcore ski or snowboarding fan, I would recommend buying this game on sale like I did. The physics are on point, and the graphics and environments are stunning. Afaik, these mountains have been mapped 1:1 and skiing them is definitely a thrill. The first comparison that comes to mind is Skate. The game feels like the winter version of Skate, and in sort of a mixture of Skate 1 and 3 in that it is realistic in some aspects but can also be more arcadey. (you can land and ski on jagged rocks to a point before you fall) I definitely think that the devs did a good job in capturing the feel of these winters sports and this is coming from someone that has skied their entire life and also dabbled in snowboarding. I think my one issue with the physics though is that skiing left and right is a bit awkward and upward cutting angles dont really work. The character loses speed way too quickly and starts reversing. Its almost like they're forcing you to go down the hill, but it does present problems in trying to navigate the vast mountains in the game.The lack of a campaign like Skate or Tony Hawk's games makes me balk at the full 79.99 price tag.  The challenges are fun, but if you are good at the game you can get through them quite quickly and they only add a couple of new ones a day. This game has incredible potential for an amazing campaign with an engaging plot, but they decided to go in the complete opposite direction and make it a sandbox. Despite the fact that game's mechanics are solid, you'll most likely end up spending quite a bit of money for the amount of time you end up playing this game.I got the season pass, so I'm looking forward to the addition of the new sports.Bottom line: If you aren't passionate about 1 or more of the sports in this game, move on. Also, gamepad is a must "

You just compete in different exhibitions whith other ppl or your friends who are already passed them - with their shadows. Or you can join (invite) in party with other ppl to ride together. As for me its a good game to relax a bit!And the only one more thing that i miss in this game - some big cartoon style costumes or sexy like bikini :D

												Steep is a good game, but it needs some work before it can be a great one. The controls are far lass tight than they should be, and nothing really seems overly intuitive. The game's objectives are generally unclear, making it difficult to really progress in this game.

												May only have a few hours, but this game doesn't seem to get old. You find new lines, new drop ins EVERYWHERE. You never take the same path going down. The visuals are amazing, the physics are pretty good aswell. It's online so you always see other people and the group of system and spectating is a nice feature. Only problem I have is when changing my riders outfits it goes into a white out, bogging and laggy my game down to 5fps, have to close and reopen if I want to continue customizing my character.

												Good game but leaves much to be desired...This is another game from ubisoft that is okay but leaves much to be desired. I've had a fair bit of fun on this game doing the challenges and trying to beat my scores and just generally travelling about. I for starters wish there were more diversatiy like unless there is one and I haven't seen it yet but no ski jump I mean like proper big ski ramps or even a dedicated skiing course. I'd also love to have snowmobiles added, why is there no snowmobiles?? Would have made an excellent way to get around map and could have even more challenges like time trails and even races with them would be a great addition to the game. Would also like to be able to do more tricks only two you can do a spin and flips as well as grabbing the board but would like to be able to grind on stuff for example if ubisoft add railings for example. Something I don't like. For one the walking is so unrealistic, I don't mean the walk cycle animation but seems like the character can climb up near on virtal walls covered in snow without slipping down like what? Walking could have been a challenge in itself but nope can walk up near enough anything it seems. So wish walking was more realistic. Also wish there were cable cars too as well as snowmobiles. I also don't like that everything looks samey just want some more variety. Otherwise I enjoy playing this game a good time killer if nothing else though would recommend getting it on a sale don't feel it's worth £40.			"

For this review im purely reviewing the new content as much of the old good hasnt changed.Alaska its self is massive and really mean its massive, there alot of detail and alot of oppurtunity to find your own killer line's. You can finally turn the game to night time too and i mean real night time not just moving the sun in a circle. Grinding is now a thing, Even if it doesnt score you points.Alaska and its post updates have really made the game a solid experience for all the sport's.(I still dislike paragliding but i guess thats not everyones cup of tea) I feel like the game has progessed enough to earn a 9/10 and im happy to recommend it for its current price tag now.OLD Review=== TL;DR - STEEP        Score - 7/10---Good's---Massive and well designed game world.Beautiful effect's for weather and snow on groundSimple control'sEasy to navigate menu'sPlenty of challenges with the ability to make your own and play other player's tooEverything is purely cosmeticGreat soundtrackCurrently the community behind this game is really friendly (Always a + IMO)Ability to customise your characters clothing and equipment (Free unless you decide to waste money buying the same currency you can earn super easy in game, Hounestly unless you litterally want to buy every peice of everything in the game you wont need to buy currency)Free DLC (Alaska)  - I know it's not out yet but a whole new map and your not charging a penny? thats always good.---Bad's---Magnets on our board's/ski's (Seriously if you dont time your jump right your gonna be glued to the floor)Some challenges seem rushedParagliding is boring outside of exploringSome fast travel's leave you under the ground (This is annoying but also hilarious as when you go to move it launches you into the sky)Online Required (Sadly if your on a trip and you thought maybe your ""Gaming"" Laptop could play this while your on the road/rails/ in the air your going to be disapointed)---Conclusion---As much as i love and have been enjoying this game since the Alpha and would love to tell you its worth £40/$60 i cant.40$ would have been a fair price for release. Yes there's lots to do in the game but if you cant find people to eventually play this with when you have completed all the challenges then your probably gonna run dry on things to do. But that being said this is probably one of the only AAA titles iv seen this year that hasnt been released broken.In its current state without any of the season pass content and alaska i give the game a forgiving 7/10			"

												You can get a good 50 hours out of this game but then (in my case at least) you would of completed all the challenged with the best medal you can get and you probably wouldnt have any more to.I enjoyed this game for the most part but seems that it isnt a game that i can always come back to as there is nothing to do now that i have completed all the challenges and unlocked everything. Tbf i don't know anyone who plays this game so i don't have anyone to do the challenges with which could be a big part of the game? but generally i would recommend just keep in mind that there isn't much to do once the challenges are done :/			"

The storyline is a bit cheesy and the character voices are not very good but the world is massive with lots of different challenges.  The only thing I would say to change about the settings is to turn off trick safety as it prevents you from doing a lot of tricks.			"

												I had bought this game in the winter sale, for what it's worth, it's actually not as bad as everyone says, the game features a great atmosphere and the graphics are just stunning, multiplayer is definitely a great aspect of the game and even on 300 ping, i can still play fine. I was worried the game wasn't worth £26 but so far it's been great. I have a few small thoughts though, considering that there isn't much to do gives it the negative impact that eventually you will get bored even with friends, luckily though if they add more DLC to the season pass i will buy it and i have faith this game will be updated with new content because of the price people have to pay.Overall, The game is fun. There are magnificent graphics, gameplay isn't too bad, voice acting needs some work and the idea of exploration is just incedible i really hope they do update this game with dlc, but as of now i have a few tips before your purchase...Do not play this game straight or it will get boringBuy it maybe from somewhere else cheaper (unless there is a sale)This is a multiplayer game, make sure you have semi ok internetOther than that, buy this game!

												After playing the alpha and beta and each version of the game improving on the last I am not dissapointed by the full release. Steep is a euphoric game, and can be enjoyed however you want. The feel of going downhill is awesome and the feel going downhill very fast is even more awesome! Paragliding around mountains and using updrafts to reach unexplored locations is sublime and is a welcome change of pace (plus you can then wingsuit back down the mountain and do it all over again!). The trick list is a bit limited however the variety of sports avaliable makes up for it and the scenerey you ride over is always changing so you never have the same ride twice. As others have said, it feels a lot like Skate 3 so if you enjoyed that game then you know a lot of what to expect. Only issues I have with it are occasional physics engine glitches and non-game play issues such as wanting a continuous soundtrack rather than having it restart every time you restrart a challenge. But these are very minor complaints compared to the fun I have had so far! "

												So I've been playing this game a little while I'm out skiing in the alps this season. I can say it's a very pretty game and some challenges can be pretty challenging. The physics are just meh nothing amazing. I like the game and enjoy certain aspects but Christ all mighty whatever guy chose the music playlist for this game must have some serious depression. Seriously haven't heard a single energetic song so far. I'm skiing gnarly lines and hitting big air I want some energy In the music instead the game plays some slow sad country song or what I think was coldplays most depressing song ever. Also the music track resets every time you do so you can listen to the same song 20times in a row. At its current price it's not worth the money. The fact this game is always multiplayer is just daft aswell. Unless you play with a group of friends it's a pretty pointless endevour. You will be playing solo 95% of the time and seeing other people on the mountain is a brief encounter as you speed past each other. I'm sorta stuck 50/50 if I reccomend this game or not. I'm gunna say no with all the irritations and the price tag. That coupled with the game Snow being the rival game and is free and less irritating I'm probably gunna go with no. Maybe if this game was cheaper and made offline play available.			"

												I'll be realistic, this game is not worth the full price, so buy it only if you want it really bad. Don't get me wrong, the game itself is really nice, relaxing, multiplayer winter sports vibes and such, but tho I really enjoy playing the game, as far as mechanics go, it feels a bit clunky in a slight way regarding controls and movements within the game. The game is not 100% optimized, it works great, but no 100%, oh and it does not support SLI, maybe in the future... Oh and this game is usually enjoyable only if your playing online with some friends, otherwise... being alone sucks...Pros:- map is HUGE and REAL- you can instantly change from using skies, snowboards, wingsuits and a ""parachute""-thing [another thing which I forgot :)  ]- fast travel- you can share replays and routes with your mates [really awesome]- relaxing, good winter vibes- you can do a dozen tricks, but this is no SSX- you can customize your character, buy new snowboards, full body costumes etc- graphics are ok, but could be way better [sorry Ubisoft]- generally you can have a lot of funCons:- the price- the game's overall mechanics feel a little bit weird [maybe it's just me]- does not support SLI- it can become boring, but hey... you don't shoot stuff here, you only chill and go with the snow...OVERALL = 8/10			"

												The game is beautiful and the mechanics are very polished, no question there. But it lacks substance. In the first 10 minutes, you are given all the different ways to get around. From there you do missions, challenges or just go around discovering new areas. The whole time you're just skiing, snowboarding, gliding or parachuting. It's boring and repetitive. Far Cry with snow and skies and absolutely nothing else.			"

												I refunded this game. Let us begin why.Firstly Steep could be used to describe the pricing of this game. It's worth noting I bought the game for £26.79 during the Steam Sale, yet I still think valuewise this is a £25 base price game.You may say ""How can you review the game with just 2 hours played?"" Well I assume this is the reason Steam made the refund time 2 hours to give the ability for the consumer to sample it enough to see whether it is enjoyable. After two hours Steep made the refund list.Don't get me wrong, Steep is enjoyable but it isn't a game you will play for a long time and you probably won't be playing it in a years time. Why? The game is repetitive. Yes this game goes for a more realistic approach similar to Skate does for skateboarding but the difference is I can still try interesting tricks in Skate that might be impossible in real life, Steep doesn't offer that luxury. The wingsuit is fun at first but ultimately tedious. The paragliding is just the worst it's boring and sure it is nice to look at the great graphics, it eventually loses the dazzling nature.What this game is really missing is fluidity. I can switch from my wingsuit to paragliding of course, but then I must land, be on foot and then switch to my snowboard. Where is the ability to attach your snowboard midair and as soon as you land go straight into snowboarding?Microtranscations, it's Ubisoft. Should be nuff said but for the unintiated Ubisoft are massive cockwombles when it comes to microtranscations. Noted it's not so bad here but basically everything ingame can be bought for real world money. Why do you need to further monetise a game which costs full AAA price and and has a season pass? This is a greedy business practice.Character customisation, very poor. Sure the ability to tweak accessories is very cool, but can I actually customise the physical aspects of my character? No I have to choose from presets. I have no clue why this is the case.I'll probably get flack from the hardcore fans of this game but Steep isn't worth £39.99, a lot of the postive reviews have even said so. If you absolutely must have this game, pick it up next time it is on sale for £26.79. It's not a bad game by any stretch, it's very beautiful, and I am sure extreme sports fans will enjoy it, but it leaves much to be desired. It's not as good as it could have been.			"

All in all I enjoyed the time I had with it, but because I played the Alpha and Beta I am already kinda finding it boring.

												I love this game.  Yes, like everyone else, I think Ubisoft are mean spirited thieves generally, but this game is really great.  It's perfect for actual grown ups, ie not highly competitive kids who scream at each other on war games.  It can be genuinely relaxing and fun to play, almost meditative, or you can go for huge jumps and do some races and all that too.It definitely makes you want to actually go skiing! The weakest part is some sort of canopy/parachute thing that seems pointless and boring, but the rest of it, the squirrel suit, the boarding and the skiing are just great.  and the helmet camera mode is very very exciting!  The best thing is you can just mess around and not feel like you have to be leveling up all the time, collecting crappy plants to make a stoopid potion or whatever.  It's chillsville funtime.			"

												Pros: +Graphics are gorgeous and you can tailer the environment in your replay to get a new look. Great for YouTubers who make boarding videos. +Huge environment to roam around and play in. Each mountian is pretty unique in the type of style you journey down it.+Variety of challenges to keep you playing. Wanted it for the snowboarding, found I spent a majority of my time in the wingsuit.+Loads of unlockable gear to make a fairly unique character.Cons: Probably my biggest con:-The difficulty on many of the ""Hard"" challenges are practically unreachable. You might say that's part of the challenge but this is a video game. People are going to be phenominal at some of these challenges, while others will be ♥♥♥♥ poor (myself included). Don't make your challenge so hard that it's practically unobtainable for the average gamer. This is why you have multiple leaderboards; To show who is better than you.-Controls are no where near as bad as people review them, however, they could use some tweaking. Navigating the map and menu's for starters are unpolished IMO.-The voiceovers and tone of some of the characters is far too intense for a winter sport game. Don't take yourself so serious Steep.-The ragdoll physics become annoying really quickly when you bail at the last checkpoint because you bounced on a small snow mound at breakneck speeds. If you're looking for EA's Skate in the snow, go play Infinite Air (Half the price, and offers plenty to warant the cost). If you want to enjoy a Winter sport game with a little more production value, you won't be disapointed with Steep.			"

												Well I do not have a substantial amount of hours in this game, comparing it to other snowboard/skiing games, this one has much to offer. As you may have seen in the store page, you can paraglide, and use wing suits, The paragliding can be alil sketchy, but wing suits seem to run really smooth, both work pretty well into the game. I would say this is a really cool game with a great idea, you may not see as many people in game as you might expect, which is probably one of the only downsides to this game.			"

												Steep is one of those games where you probably will need to have experienced similar games prior to playing it to enjoy it [Think Amped or SSX] however, unlike those more traditional sorts of snowsports games, Steep takes it one step further and makes it open world. You can do whatever you want, you aren't bound to any obligations, but you do have to do challenges to level up. It's challenging, seeing other players randomly is also very nice too, it makes it feel a bit like Journey in the sense that you don't see 100 people around you at once, but you'll get a few in there to give you more of an 'I'm not alone on this mountain journey' vibe.Really the only negative thing I can think of is once you run out of money to earn through the story and challenges there is no way to make money anymore so there will not be any 'unlock every piece of gear' runs, which is unfortunate. Hopefully that has been fixed or updated by the time you read this review.			"

												Super fun game if you're into skiing/snowboarding or are a lover of SSX series. In the game basically you can ski/snowboard/paraglide/wingsuit on a huge map set in a replica of the Alps. Price is a lttle bit steep but it's definately worth it if it's on sale.  Also they are planning on releasing Alaska for free!As for performance, it runs smoothly on ultra with GTX970. There are some  little bugs but nothing gamebreaking. They have also fixed some bugs.			"

												I've played about 10 hours of this in the first 2 days of buying it and I'm very happy with the purchase.  I bought the Gold Edition, which I recommend, because it gives you access to more terrain which you will probably want.  Although the Alps (included with base game) is an incredibly vast area that could take you months to explore.  I feel that I've barely scratched the surface of the available terrain in the Alps.  This is the most fun I've had in a winter sports game since 1080 Snowboarding for the Nintendo 64.  It really captures the feel of skiing/snowbarding in deep powder.If you're looking for a game with a highly structured campaign, keep looking. This is an open-world, sandbox with the fun you get out of it being highly dependent on your own sense of adventure.  There are plenty of well set-up races and wingsuit jumps with checkpoints and opponents to keep you busy with structured events -- but be prepared to go exploring if you want to get the most out of this game.  Multiplayer is a blast, with the ability to group with three other people and take on the mountain.  You will find plenty of random strangers, sometimes in the middle of nowhere, willing to group with you.  It really adds a nice feel seeing other people doing the same lines you are doing. At 1440p on a 144Hz monitor, this game flogs my 1070-based system.  I'm not running on ultra settings, I had to take it down to ""high"" and turn all AA off to get 60-80 FPS.  Then I turned resolution scaling down to 0.9 so that I could get consistent FPS above 100, which is where I like it.  It still looks AMAZING and part of what makes the adventure on the mountain(s) so fun is the beauty of it all, with dynamic day/night cycles.The #1 complaint about this game coming out of the Steam reviews is the price. I got the Gold Edition on Steam Sale for $40 (50% off regular price) and I think that's more or less fair for a game that's only been out for four months.  I would not pay $80 for the Gold Edition.

												I'm a huge snowboard fan, and at first glance, Steep has all it takes for an excellent game.Casually exploring endless gorgeous slopes while pulling off sick stunts is sublime joy of this game.Which gets interrupted as soon as the game tries to force you into narrow-scoped parts of gameplay. Which alone are not that bad if not for:-Speed and three star courses challenge controls which are not set for precision - which leads to endless attemts to beat these courses. In fact, you cannot enjoy this game fully without a decent gamepad.-Lack of well-designed progression. Yes, you have level and earn currency for outfits. But it doesn't change what you do and how you do it. It's too sandboxy and doesn't engage for lenghts. The career should be more peculiar and directional, with championships to qualify, sponsorships to chase and things to spend dough on.-Fast-travel becomes too common. New slopes get unlocked instead of being discovered - you loose track of surroundings.-In-game store lacks of major brands.-No social activities. Yeah, you can bump into couple of people here and there but there's nothing to do together to stay in touch. Ideally, you would chat with people about cool slopes while in the chairlift - to then get there and explore.-Annoying region lock. Why should Ubisoft deprive customers of choice of language? Not to say that it came with the chinese pack when installed.-Offputting price. Regardless of your region, the game costs premium. On top of that, there's microtransactions. Oh, and remember how much you paid yesterday? IT'S ON 50% SALE A DAY LATER.-Other sports are kinda... meh.Note it's just a perfectionist criticism.I rate the game 7.7/10, and will come back over and over. Just maybe not that often.			"

												Warning, there is a possibility you will not be able to launch the game ie crashing on startup, it has nothing to do with outdated drivers or slow hardware. I can find no information on a surefire solution and have reinstalled multiple times with every kind of usual fix methods. I am certain it has to do with Uplay not recognizing the game's activation code, and closing the game right away. Will edit review once a fix has been found. The problem is only connected to Steam, Owning the game through Uplay works fine to my knowledge.Also don't downvote because the game works fine for you, and you think the problem doesn't exist, because it very much exists and is a very serious problem.

Now that the full game has come out I'm not sure when I'll be stopping.The controls take a little to get used to, but once you do they're awesome.Animations are also brilliant, easily the best skiing/snowboarding animations from any game.The map is huge, and looks beautiful all around, the weather changes are great and really set the atmosphere for each part of the map.Unlocking new outfits, and getting more money is extremely addictive, along with trying to get the highest score on any of the challenges.This will be one of my favorite games, and I definitely recommend it to everyone.p.s. the tutorial is pretty boring, but once you're past that it's great			"

												Steep™  is an open-world extreme sports game that can cover your EA Skate 3 itch that you have been holding for years! You can do up 4 different sports in this game that fits your style of gameplay. There is Snowboarding, Skiing, Wingsuits, and even paragliding. It holds many challenges to do for each sport and you can even make your own for your friends to beat.If you are not big on the challenge thing, there is much exploration you can do. The map is very big and cut into sections of a couple different mountains. You can just ride or fly your way down with a breathtaking view of the whole mountain. There are areas called ""Points of Interest"" throughout each mountain that you can find while exploring the vast areas of the map. The physics in this game, in my opinion, might need some touch up on but it's not too bad honestly. there are sometimes where you'll just randomly get pulled to the ground when going over a hump of snow. Other times it's just completely fine. There is a G-Force feature put into the game so if you hit the ground too hard or hit too many things at a time you will crash which helps with the realism of the game and can prevent big trick spams.Lastly, there is character customization, it's not a lot but it's enough to show your personality of what you would want. There are premade characters of professional athletes you may or may not know, but you can buy different boards, skis, wingsuits, parachutes, clothes, etc. for your characters of choice.I might have only 20hrs of gameplay when I made this review, but I can see myself playing it for much more in the future since not many good extreme sports game are made often.Overall I give Steep™ a solid 9.5/10All it needs is a couple bug fixes and maybe some more songs for the gameplay if you're into music like I am.

												STEEP is a fantastic game, the graphics are immersive and animations are very smooth and responsible, the game just flows. Multiplayer is seamless and new players pop into your world all the time based on proximity. Challenges are fun and hard and the different types of sports really make it engaging with more to come in dlcs.			"

												Steep is a love it or hate it type of game. Its really quite difficult to tell where you'll fall in. This game is about the experience of the mountain and the comraderie of meeting other players to tear up the mountain with.  Unlike older games in the genre like SSX, you don't have a career mode or endless challenges to complete. There are some yes, but you'll finish them quickly. Steep excels in allowing you to make your own challenges and connect with other players. If you aren't fascinated with winter sports (or similar sports) and aren't really interested in the community aspect, you'll probably finish all the challenges and get bored. The controls are also very tricky. They are intuitive once you get used to them, but having to juggle all these buttons and joysticks to pull of tricks is a bit daunting at first. Similarly the game gives you some basic tutorials, but there is way more to the mechanics than is explained there that you kind of have to learn yourself. If you're riding on just what the tutorial tells you, that's probably only 25% of your capabilities. In addition to all this the game has some flaws and bugs. The UI is obtrussive and annoying. Riding and tricking is based on physics, which sometimes can flip out and cause your rider to do weird things like fly sideways off a jump or get stuck on a shallow hill. These are minor annoyances in my opinion, but can be frustrating. Especially if you're working on a difficult challenge or other player's dare and get caught out by one. That being said Steep has many good things that outweight the bad. Switching between sports on the fly is super easy and all the sports are really cool (yes, even paragliding). The environment is vast and gorgeous and the snow deformation is just breathtaking. The ability to teleport anywhere with no loading times is also a technological marvel. There are lots of awesome locations not marked on the map and plenty of cool easter eggs to boot. Character customization is extensive and the character models are highly detailed. And finally the game doesn't take itself to seriously, with plenty of goofy diversions and silly costumes to choose from. I think Steep is a great game, but I have noticed that people who really aren't into the winter sports or the community aspect are more likely to be put off by the bugs that are present. If you like sports games and played a lot of SSX you'll probably like it. If you're on the fence, wait for some updates and season pass stuff to come out.			"

												This is a great game for what it is. The extreme sports genre on PC is beyond limited so this is a breath of fresh air. I don't recommend it to everyone but anyone who used to enjoy SSX or Amped or even 1080 back on n64 should like this. The controls take a bit of getting used to but once you get them down it's a blast.			"

I recommend playing with a PS4 controller since this game supports it well and it's more comfortable than keyboard & mouse (at least I think so after playing about 5 hours with each). Just plug it in your PC and you're good to go! Great game!			"

												Don't get me wrong -- it's a great game. For £39.99 however? Not a chance. Wait six months for it to come down to £20 odd, then it'll be a recommendation. The game needs some serious polishing, there is still some problems with riding and tricks, which in a game like this is a MASSIVE oversight but Ubisoft have released it anyway.Game runs on Uplay -- which isn't THAT bad! (suprisingly). The Uplay system works pretty well with this game and I have no issue with it.Overall, it's not worth £39.99. It's a good game, but not justifyable at that price.			"

												Roughly 30 hours playtime. I've reached level cap and maxed all different riding disciplines, earning myself legendary status.And you know what? It's just the beginning. I bet I'll be spending hundreds of hours on this digital vacation this game has taken me since release.There's so much to love in this game, and I'll be completely upfront; this isn't a objective opinion at all.You like starting off on a sunny hill filled with deep powder, and leisurely ski downhill, enjoing the weather, listening to some chill music? The game lets you do that, and rewards you for it.Want to jump off the most fearsome looking mountain, skydiving past rocky outcroppings that look like hell on earth, adrenaline making your hands shaky? The game lets you do that, and rewards you for it.My only nagging points are minor. The ""level cap"" at 25 is... Odd. I liked doing the different disciplines so much that I capped out quickly, but kept at it anyway. Sometimes, the control system and physics engine doesn't make any sense at all, and other days it's smoother than butter on a hot pan.I'm a little worried at longevity, but Ubisoft has lately had a trend with updating their games with both free and paid content that holds a decent standard. Might return to redact this in case things change.TL;DR: If you liked SSX or any similar game/series, but felt like you never had real freedom - here it is. Enjoy.			"

												I do not like this game for the following reasons:- In my opinion, Any sport you can do in this game gets boring pretty quickly. - If you try to flip in the air the game sometimes blocks you from doing that, it says you are too low. That is like a race game braking for you because you are going to fast towards turns. Just let me fail, I will figure out when I can flip myself.- I could not find any rails in the game. I have no idea if I could not find any or if there are none. All snowboard game I have played have rails, it just feels essential to these kind of games.- It feels empty of any progression. Most games like these are focused on career mode and it that gives the game a purpose.- I really cannot stand my character saying anything. Everything he says is stupid. something like ""ai ai ai ai"" and ""this is our time and our place to conquer"". could'nt they have come up with something better? - The game lacks interesting characters with differing personalities. It would be way more fun if this was the case.- No real combos - In my opinion the soundtracks are boring.- The game lacks interesting designI remember playing ssx3- Hard to do combos that reward a speed boost in game (rails gave you extra speed). The game rewarded taking risks.- Characters that hold a grudge against you if you punch them to the ground. Violence gave boosts.- Characters that have weird personalities- Interesting radio stations that report your achievements- The soundtracks were way better and faded while you where in the air to build up excitement.- Interesting design. The game had shortcuts that were hard to reach.- A career mode that was interesting and had real progression.I would not recommend buying this game, I have had more fun playing games that were cheaper than €5.

												Sonny Bono's How Not To Die Simulator 2016.But seriously, a large bulk of the challenges in this game require you to dodge and maneuver through patches of trees which require more than just quick reflexes. It borders on the need for psychic abilities.When it comes down to it though, that's just the beginning of a list of design flaws that this game has. It's amazingly polished, has a ton of content, and really looks like a $60 game on the surface, but when you start to dig in, you realize that the frustrations do not make it worth even half that amount. Some of the challenges require you to get from point A to point B with no set time limit. However, if you find yourself missing a certain line, get ready to walk (and make sure to tell your family to start dinner without you, because it's going to be a while).If you're also coming into this game looking for a fine-tuned freestyle experience, look elsewhere. Steep is very obviously aimed at people just looking for the thrill of the ride and the exploration. Tricks are very simplistic and do not have a good enough amount of variations. If you're looking for a freestyle snowboarding experience, you're much better off going with Mark McMorris Infinite Air . It's definitely much less polished than Steep and has a fraction of the content, but at the end of the day, the snowboarding just feels so much better. Put both games at the $20 price point, and I'd gladly take Infinite Air over Steep any day.			"

												I am a snowboarding fanatic and loved STEEP in the open beta which was flawless with no bugs 100% clean.However now that i have purchased the full version its just full of gamebreaking bugs WTF?!? Is ubisoft actually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that they have a clean BETA version and a full version full of bugs i dont understand this logic, and these bugs are not dependant on PC specs as many people have them even with beast computers,i have a mid-range computer myself.First bug just glitches character customizeation menu to 5fps switch back to the in-game and it runs smoothly with 120fps so if you want any customizeation say Bye Bye to that.Another one that i didnt have yesterday but now randomly have is everything just glitching on the screen which is really annoying.I just wonder how many bugs this thing has in it since i only have 4 hrs and already 2 gamebreaking bugs found and from the look of the forums it seems that yet again Ubisoft just doesnt give a damn about you and just want your money.For a 60euro game these bugs are a complete BS for that kind of money and ruined experience and i do not reccommend this game once they have patched it,seems like this is ALPHA version all over again.

												In my opinion this is an excellent game with fantastic visuals and mountain views, the one problem I have is that on certain challenges you are  required to make dangerous jumps which are hard to complete without falling over, this is not a problem as long as you  are landing on flat ground however if you are landing on a slope you will have to roll all the way down or restart the challenge. This after a while gets very frustrating not because you are pretty much forced restart but because the character makes no effort to get up and slow down. In conclusion if you get angry easily then I do not think this is the game for you but other than that I cannot find any thing wqrong with the game.			"

												Steep is a difficult game to assess. Despite putting 40+ hours into the game I would say that I've enjoyed less than 4 of those hours. For me, the biggest failing of the game is that despite being open-world, most challenges lock you into a fixed route where you must pass through a bunch of checkpoints. These challenges are tedious and repetative, unless you enjoy memorizing lines and repeating/refining them.However, Steep excels when it gets out of its own way and lets you be creative about the line you take. Unfortunately, maybe 10% of the missions give you just a start and end point, and leave what is inbetween up to you. One of the best ones is a multi-minute epic ride across multiple faces and ridges, but I have yet to encounter another challenge like it.Overall I would say that Steep is far less enjoyable than Amped 2 was; which the last snowboarding game I played. Pros:It has some impressive graphics, particularly the lighting effects. The wingsuit and hang-glider are interesting additions to an extreme sports game.Some of the challenges are really fun; or very rewarding to pull off.Large area to ride through.Almost no loading time when teleporting around the mountains.Cons:Most of the challenges are boring/repetative.Controls were very sluggish/unresponsive.- Note: I was using an XBOX 360 controller, which I've used for a fair number of Steam games, but Steep seemed to ignore diagonal input entirely.Using both sticks to control turning is an interesting concept, but was not a good design decision.I was unable to use the character customization screen for more than a minute due to lag (eventually crashing the program).Edit: I forgot to mention that the soundtrack is very limited, particularly compared to the Amped franchise.

												Don't get me wrong -- it's a great game. For £39.99 however? Not a chance. Wait six months for it to come down to £20 odd, then it'll be a recommendation. The game needs some serious polishing, there is still some problems with riding and tricks, which in a game like this is a MASSIVE oversight but Ubisoft have released it anyway.Game runs on Uplay -- which isn't THAT bad! (suprisingly). The Uplay system works pretty well with this game and I have no issue with it.Overall, it's not worth £39.99. It's a good game, but not justifyable at that price.			"

												I'm updating this review because originally I said I was torn on this game. I'm not torn anymore, Don't buy it. Even if its on sale don't buy it. The controls are simply not managable at all and the final straw is how terrible the navigation map is. It is impossible to travel around in this game with any kind of efficiency. The entire map is buggy and hard to use. Its just an awful interface.3 Pros: 1)The game is beautiful. 2)Like 1080 snowboardering with a fun open world feel3)Its easy to get fully immersed in this game's graphics when flying around 3 Cons: 1)The controls are terrible. 2)Map is buggy and hard to use. 3) I don't need a third con. These two problems are debilitating and suck the fun out of the game. In Conclusion, I DO NOT RECOMMEND this game. Its to hard to play. Whats the point in an open world game if you can't traverse it easily due to a bad map interface. Honestly, the only fun thing in this game is the wingsuit because the controls make sense, but good luck finding any wingsuit challenges on the map.			"

												I'll start this review by saying that the game is rather over-priced, it doesn't really have much of a purpose to it other than complete some challenges, it feels like doing the sub-quests in an Assassins Creed game. Aside from that, the game plays rather well, smooth fps and great graphics, a few minor details that could look more realistic, but for what it is right now it's very nice. The gameplay is very fun if you're interested in those addrenaline filled sports but don't have the money or the balls to actually go out and do it yourself in the real world. This game would be excellent if it was played in VR (virtual reality).One personal issue I've ran into is the game crashed numerous times, however I found out that was due to my Graphics Card overheating and going into ""Nope-Mode"" to save itself from any cheeky damages. I have never ran into such an issue with the card on any other games, most of which are newly realeased / high-end games. Keep an eye on your hardware temps with this one, just in case. To remedy this I moved one of my many case fans to get better air-flow to the GPU, you can also try leaving your case door off / open. This may also have been due to hot weather however it still didn't happen with other games that day. Just a heads up for anyone else on a possible issue!Anyway, I would give this game a solid 7 / 10 - loses points for being a bit over-priced and having that ♥♥♥♥ing stupid GoPro Karma drone in it, ♥♥♥♥ing worst drone ever released.. And loses points for some bad hardware compatibility. Gains points for a decently well made game despite the GPU temperature thing, sound effects are fine, graphics look great, and the gameplay has a nice feel to it.			"

												This game is a lot of fun to start off. The game is fantastic for skiing, snowboarding, and squirel suit flying. Something that people may not enjoy as much in this game is paragliding. At first when playing the game i didnt really enjoy that aspect either but the more I paraglided the more I enjoyed it because they have some chalenging fun chalenges for paragliding. Overall is the game worth $60? If buying this game for that amount of money don't do it go on sale but if its within your disposable income I would reccomend it if you in any way like snowboarding games because steep takes those genres to the next level. Also the sound track for the game in really good. You can easily space out and relax for hours at a time just messing around in this game.			"

												Personally I like it but getting this at the whole price really depends on your preferences. The game is fun, you can do races with your friends on the tallest mountains and you can customize your character with points you recieve by winning different races. However, as I said, the price is a little bit exaggerated but the game has no big issues. Also, the controls are alright, and I want to mention this because I saw a lot of people being mad of that reason. It might be kinda difficult at the beggining but after 2 hours it will be just fine.If you like the winter sports and you have enough money, then you can buy it . If you like the winter sports but you can't afford spending money play SNOW instead.			"

Jumps are everywhere, you'd have to be the computer itself to be able to get a streak3. Theres pretty much no story, you could sum it up in a paragraph4. The tricks are buggy, ex: you hold spacebar and relase to jump and press a combination of your choosing WASD SPACEBAR, WA+SPACEBAR= only, (basicly you need to have perfect timing5. you have to unlock the most fun parts of the game by going through the hardest6.

												I dont even know where to start. The beta was better than the actual release, I payed full price for this game because i really enjoyed it in the closed beta and alpha. However, as it stands this game is a polished piece of schyt. It looks and feels great, but most of the advertisment points (I.e skiiing with friends, discovering the mountains together, etc.) is complete bullschyt. i have 17 hours in this game and most of it is waiting to see if my friends can join me, they cant. this games multiplayer/ Pairing system is like all the other Uplay garbage theyve thrown their asses and i think they should just light a match and let themselves burn while watching steam pickup the slack. they dont even make an effort to fix these issues that plague so many forums that its become a ""general discussion"" instead of technical support. even after emailing multiple times to ubisoft support and having them tell me ""reinstall windows thatll fix it"" and ""you have a memory leak"" (neither of these were relevant to conectivity). I wouldnt recommend this game to and imbred autistic kid with abandonment issues living in africa, itd just be more dissapointment in their lives, and I'm Fuc -king Fed up of all this Horseschyt.

												Snowboarding is not fun in this game. The gameplay for snowboarding gives a very unpleasant sensation from the combination of bad controls, the inability to turn back up the mountain, and the awful camera. The mountain is attractive but you quickly realize there's nothing genuinely interesting anywhere. It's basically just a procedurally generated map. Ubisoft doesn't understand that the size of worlds doesn't matter if there's nothing interesting or neat within them. SSX understood this. Also you still have to use Uplay, which is pretty awful and pointless. I will give Ubisoft credit for the snappy instant transports. It's nice to be able to play nonstop without being concerned about loading times. That's a very nice part of the game. In the end, I returned this within 2 hours and daydreamed about SSX on PC.			"

												First off. Steep is not worth £40. i bought it when it was £26 and it still isnt worth it. the gameplay is ok but it comes with its issues. Parachuting is clunkly and awful. Skiing is fun and fast paced but after landing you seem to loose incredible amounts of speed, same with snowboarding but not as bad. The wing-suit seems to be well rounded and quite fun.Overall i would say this game is fun, but should not be priced £40, or even £26 (christmas sale). if it was £20 i would have reccomended this game but sadly its over priced.

Very smooth launch, servers are working fine, but I have had two crashes in the 4 hours I've played so far.

												Extremely fun and addicting.playing this game for the first time I had trouble navigating everywhere. but once you slowely figure out the controls and how the movement works its really fun.still needs some updates to fix certain things but I highly recommend this game to any Snowboard/Skateboarding fan.to me it reminds me of Tony Hawks Downhill jam.

 The Good  Huge area to explore Impressive, smooth visuals Good balance between realism and arcade handling Fresh take on extreme sports The Bad  Predictable events Multiplayer does nothing to expand or diversify the game Doesn't make the most of its setting or sports  The Ugly Microtransactions, while not too obvious, are there to squeeze more cash out of you "

												I really wanted to enjoy this game, but unfortunately I was getting motion sickness within a few minutes while snowboarding. Tried some tweaks to no avail. I have requested a refund. I am still giving a positive review as it looks like a lot of fun - my experience is not a reflection on the game, just a problem I have personally with some games. If you suffer motion sickness from some games, maybe give this one a miss, or try watching it on youtube for a while and see how you feel.			"

												Steep. The game to fill the hole in my heart that skate has left me since I switched to PC gaming so many years ago.This game is not something most people will want to play each and every day like they would play dota2 or counter strike. It's not a game about completing all the challenges or getting the level cap as fast as possible. it's a game about snowboarding, skiing, paragliding and flying with your wingsuit. Your playground is a huge place with various mountains. the game leaves you on your own and you can do whatever the hell you want.The challenges are all awesome and it feels to me that every single race is polished and balanced. I can't comprehend how much work it must have taken to build a world like this and make it feel consistently awesome.Anyway, it's not ultra-super-amazing realistic. It certainly looks like it would be, but there's some arcade mechanics worked into how the game plays, and in my opinion that's exactly how it should be! It's still a game people, if you had a ultra-realistic snowboarding game you would fall every 7 seconds.To conclude my review, I don't think I'll ever get enough of Steep. It fills my times of boredom and gives me an opportunity to just hang back and chill out. I recommend it!			"

												I'm SOOOO glad this turned out to be awesome. I played the beta and was instantly hooked, I prayed that it would stay the same when this got released.Awesome graphics, simple handling controls (for me at least), challenges are great for improving tricks and handling.Just walking on foot is enjoyable too, makes you appreciate the view.If you're into any sorts of sports game, you should give it a try.

												  Steep was a great game! I would have paid full price for this one. I have played each sport in the game with no disappointments. I absolutly love how the game immerses you into the intensity of the situations you put yourself in. This is a can be either a very compettetive game to you and your friends or a very relaxed game for yourself. This game is whatever you want it to be honestly. If you like time trials and compettition BOOM it's there. If you're just trying to play a game and chill, listen to music, BOOM you can take a chopper to the top of a mountain and ski/snowboard/paraglide/wingsuit down for about an hour and also explore new obstacles yourself. I am still playing the game and trying to get gold in each event but after that I'll be making my own trails to replay myself later.			"

												I used to play snowboard games on PS2, so I definitely had to buy it and I am amazed. Im playing it on ultra and it just looks gorgeous. I have so many thinks to say about this game but I just can´t get them out of my self, because I just can´t stop playing :) I will just put few points that are touching me right now in my mind. And I will just update it by the time I refresh my head :P+smooth play on a controller+graphics+sountrack+amount of things by which you can change your character-only minus I found far by now, I can´t imagine playing it on a keyboard			"

												My experience with this game can be summed as thus: every update I found myself testing the changes, nodding in satisfaction, then quitting the game to await the next update.Arkane knows how to make a good game. No question. But if you film an Oscar-worthy movie and the lens is smudged while filming, you can't judge what's underneath without acknowledging what's been marring your experience the entire time.=============================PERFORMANCE Everyone is aware of the performance issues, and these still persist to this day. It runs much better than at launch, where it was literally unplayable, but that's because the game looks worse than before - the most noticeable change being the extremely aggressive LOD scaling. Out of the corner of your eye you notice the shapes of window frames and posters on distant buildings morphing in shape, or the furniture at the opposite end of a long hallway suddenly blinking into existence. FPS dropped to 15 when stabbing a gravehound, so they simply removed the inky visual effect that was causing the problem instead of optimizing it.Also, Denuvo authentication is one of the longest ""loading screens"" of the game. Around half a minute to a full minute or more every startup.=============================GAMEPLAY For the most part, gameplay is excellent and is Dishonored's strongest suit. Dark Vision was changed to a blurry short range sonar so unlike Dishonored 1 you aren't constantly seeing blue and yellow because you had no reason not toAI is much smarterNonlethal combat options are a blastBonecharm crafting system allows for player flexibility and ""builds""Each level feels lived-in while maintaining the duality of directive flow and open options that made the first game so good.Emily and Corvo have distinct animations and final weapon upgrades. The animations are supremely cool.Each level is fairly distinct, some with extremely interesting central ""gimmicks."" I do, however, wish the game relied less on them and had more ""regular"" areas.However, under the hood lie other problems. Most of them are quality-of-life issues:Gone are the hotkeys for journal, inventory, bonecharms, powers. Only one ""journal"" exists now, despite still having separate subsections.It took months for the power wheel to be fixed. It took almost a full second after activating to pop up and be usable, breaking flow so badly I almost never used it in the first place. It's finally fixed now, but this issue was glaring and it took so long to be addressed most of us played through without it fixed.Thrown objects don't always go exactly where your crosshair is. While this adds a layer of difficulty, it feels noticeably more clunky than in the first game.Mana regen is pitifully slow. From using a power to fully regenerating, Dishonored 1's time is 4.7 seconds -> 3.1 seconds with Spiritual Pool. Dishonored 2's time with 4x Spiritual Pool is 6.3s -> 5.5s. The devs said they fixed this effect, but it was only made worse.Bugs. Street speakers not playing. Dying after possessing gravehounds. An arc pylon never shutting down after pulling out its power, leaving it to either be dangerous to you to dangerous to your nonlethal playthrough. Some of these still aren't fixed.=============================STORY AND ATMOSPHERE Reactivity Great. My favorite part of Dishonored. You need to hide from a gang member to access a certain black market shop, and there are different scenarios and dialogue for if you hide, if you run into him outside, kill him outside, or kill him inside.Emily and Corvo Emily and Corvo are voiced. And... they don't talk enough. It's good that they're silent for most of the game, but there are times when you come across a portrait or photograph with an ""Inspect"" prompt. I'd love to hear Emily's thoughts on the High Overseer as see how that compares to Corvo's, or if it changes based on whether or not you accept the Outsider's Mark. Instead, all I get is the protagonist muttering the name of the person pictured. What's the point? Might as well keep them silent.It made sense to me to play Emily first, but her story felt lackluster, like people at every turn were saying ""check your royal privilege"" despite my efforts to resolve everyone's problems without drawing blood. Corvo's is MUCH more interesting as a veteran of Dishonored 1.The Outsider and The Void I hate the new Outsider and his new voice. He felt threatening and malicious in the first game due to how calm and composed he was, and the Void felt like a strange and otherworldly place. The vignettes of Dunwall made it feel both unnatural and unnerving yet fundamentally woven into the universe. In Dishonored 2, it's just smoky blackness and sharp rocks. The Outsider is much jollier and moves around erratically, making grandiose hand gestures. They actually had a plot plot that could explain this change, but it was never addressed, so it just seems like a pointless retcon to me.Main Plot Dishonored's worldbuilding was always one of its appeals, and that remains true in Dishonored 2. However, the villains felt lackluster. Only the main villain has a real presence throughout the game, whereas everyone else feels introduced abruptly only to fall by your hand, all within the same mission. In Dishonored 1 everything felt personal and real. Perhaps it was because of the long intro where you interacted with most of them, or the Hound Pits's cast of characters all having different connections to your targets.=============================As you can see, I've played this game a LOT and have put a lot of thought into it. It was definitely worth all those hours and all that money, but the condition it was at launch and the sluggish drip-feed of support we barely get now is unacceptable. To set a precedent for future games, I can't recommend buying this unless they manage to fix all the performance issues and bugs, which doesn't seem to be happening anytime soon.			"

												Plenty of good stuff here.  BUT It gets old quickly and feels like a purely ""sandbox"" gameVery similiar to Planet Coaster in the sense that the base game design is brilliant but the FEATURES and gameplay are somewhat shallow, while still fairly enjoyable.   Any comparison to SSX or Amped is fair, but those games were really structured around racing and arcade style gameplay.Steep is like dirt in that its a semi simulation, however its lacking a sense of commitment to racing or tricks.Steep would definitely benefit from being a lot more realistic, and geared towards being a simulator that makes it more challenging.  ATM you can ski backwards over cliffs without much challenge in staying up. ITs like you just watch your rider do his thing and you dont feel really connected physically with the game because of the lack of feel.SSX is VERY dated BTw that style of gameplay would not hold up today and I think Steep has really hit the nail on what a next gen snowboard game should be. A free Open world to traverse as you please with the ability to hook up with friendsThe graphics are really good and optimized, however the gameplay and game design suffers.Im going to recommend the game purely on whats here to enjoy, but I wish it was better in so many ways8/10 "

												I haven't found a game in a long time that I've cracked out on.  I used to game hard in high school, went through College, and have since moved to Colorado to enjoy all the glorious snowboarding the Rockies has to offer.  This is a sick addition to fill my free time during the work week when I can't get out to the mountains to shred.  The physics are incredible.  The touch and feel of the game really feels like you're actually on a snowboard (I can't say for ski's - I've never been).  It's a huge refresher in comparison to all the winter sports games of the past where everything feels arcade-like or ultra user friendly.  This one takes a little time to pick up.  I'll also say it gives you that same feeling of exploration that an MMO or RPG gives.  It's vast and you enjoyably get lost in the depth of it all like playing Skyrim or Final Fantasy.  All in all, a great game and should give enjoyment for months or even years to come!			"
