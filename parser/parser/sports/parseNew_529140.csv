								The game has a great cultural background very well implemented; it starts with the mechanics and reaches its visual and musical style.I liked the way everything is mixed, the variety of characters, the gameplay mechanics and the game's main goal.Of course, there's room for improvement and I've reached the developers about it. The good news is that they have plans to work on some of those improvements to give us all a better experience.If you enjoy games that have a cultural background as well as fighting games, I'd recomment it. NOTE: This game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hard to grasp, and even harder to master. So, if you're looking for a challenge, you're up for it.GOOD LUCK IN TRYING TO WIN YOUR FIRST MATCH PS: Hey devs, that should be a good achievement to implement, haha!			"

								Fast paced basketball game of the gods, but be for warned mortals that the team of the gods are fast savage and hard. Take in the wonderful graphics, gameplay and fun sounds. Be ready to train as winning in this game takes loads of time and efforts. ;-)			"

								Interesting spin on the classic Smash Bro's formula. Fun to play, but does have a few issues that need to be fixed.Check out my full Indie Impression:

			I try out ""Ulama: Arena of the Gods"", a 2D Brawler that puts a unique spin on the genre. DISCLAIMER: I received the key for this game free in exchange for doing this video.
