												Meh, just meh. Doesn't even have an option for keyboard mode. You're better spending your money on Moonpies or maybe a bit of real meat vs virtual bulls.			"

												I actually enjoyed this game, it's something different. It's like the Tony Hawk of bullfighting. I just wish there was blood. Now we need a sequel, Running From The Bulls. With the option to be the bull :D			"

												Thank you for keyboard overlay.  Game seems fun, kind of a pain to figure out with keyboard.  I would say buy only if you have the controller to use for game.			"

												It's very hard for me to write a Review about this game, because it is so bad it didn't even let me play!Short Review:The greatest Failure in gaming history!Long Review:When i first startet the game a bad animated intro with one of the worst sounds welcomed me. Becase it told me i could skip this with the B button on my controller, I connected it to my PC and pressed B, but nothing happend. So i pressed every button and every key on my keyboard until Esc eventually skiped it. After this intro i was presented with a loading screen, with usefull tips about the game. After one full minute of waiting i alt+f4'ed out of this hell of a game, only to give it a 2nd try.I disconected my controller, because the game doesn't support it and started the game again. this time i quickly skiped the intro and after 2 seconds the loadingscreen was finished with loading. After pressing enter the game showed me one of the ugliest main menu's i've ever seen. I tried to navigate through the menu down to the options with w,a,s,d but pressing the S key only quites this game.So i Started the Game a 3rd Time, skiped the intro and pressed enter to get to the main menu. navigating with the arrow keys worked, so i finally got to the options. I tried to change the controlls but it only showed me a picture of a xbox 360 controller and some text at every button wich told me what the button did and the only thing i noticed is that the only purpose of the A,B,X and Y button is to skip the intro or other sequences what probably tells you a lot about the game if about half of the buttons only purpose is to skip the intro.I couldn't change the controls, so i tried to get back to the menu but even this was harder than it sounds, i pressed every button but not even Esc could help me so eventually i had to press alt+f4 again.Starting the game again, skipping the intro, pressing enter to get to the menu and i started the campain. I promptly was confronted with a close up of an low poly version of an creepy looking old man and the options to set his name, the location, his skin color and eye color - because every good game needs character customisation.After changing everything to my likeing, wich where the same as default, because i had still no clue why this game needs these options i tried to start the campain, but nothing worked. I noticed that at the bottoms are controlls: up down to navigate through the options, LB and RB to rotate the model and B to Cancle. Ther wasn't even a button on the controller that would have allowed you to continue, so i gave up and tried Esc to Escape this Hell, but as always with this game: it didn't work! So i pressed alt+f4 for the last time and i'll let the game collect dust in the endless void of my steam library.			"

												A lot of words will be wasted voicing outrage over the game's subject matter. I suspect an equal number of words will be wasted pointing out the ostensible hypocrisy of people who think nothing of shooting digital humans, but feel the need to howl over the killing of a digital bull. I won't bother injecting my point of view because many of you, like me, just want to know if it's worth 4.99. The simple answer is no. Bull fights are essentially made up of two mini games. The first has you taunt the bull in order to get it to charge your cape. The basic idea is to perform strings of combos in order to increase your score as well as crowd favor. The second is a series of timed button presses. Both are repeated over a four round match. Overall it's a fairly shallow game. The controls are extremely stiff and somewhat non-responsive . Matches lack any depth while managing to feel too long. What's more the actual killing of the bull isn't shown. The Tercio de Muerte is nothing more than a couple of button presses ending with the bull charging off camera followed by a score card. I imagine some people will view this as a good thing. Why am I giving this a thumbs up? The game isn't totally devoid of entertainment value, but mostly because I welcome the chance to experience something different regardless of what side of the line my moral compass points towards. I can appreciate someone trying something different, but if I were you I would wait till it's on sale. Word of warning this game works with the Xbox 360 controller, but not the Xbox One controller.

												Game concept is good the sport is awsome.  Graphics need some wark as well as the controller support.  My Xbox  conrtroller does not work but my Steam controller does.  The price is right at 5 bucks. Like the sport the moves are important to master.  Good game but not for all. If you like the sport it is a great addition to your library.			"

												Hello, I'm a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥ right now, because some idiot gamers in the review section have said that this game is cruel toward animals. First off, grow some balls you pansies ☺. This game is just a virtual depiction of a sport very sacred in my culture. So maybe before criticizing the treatment of bulls, think about whether you may or may not be being a racist.Now to the game, because that's the important part of this review:Some of you kids seem to think that a virtual bull being stabbed in its rump is more vile than actually eating your stupid hamburgers you stupid American fatsos. Now ♥♥♥♥ you. I'm a little mad because we should be talking about the game when you little tiny idiots are so small you can't even comprehend the importance of this sport you miniature idiots. Maybe you Dwarven smurf petite dinky microscopic nerds can read up on wikipedia because I don't have time to educate you paltry gnomes. Lil baby boys. Puny.So about the game:This is a 8.7/10 but pip-squeak idiots like the ones in this review section wouldn't be able to comprehend that because their brains are tiny as heck.The sound is fantastic. The graphics remind me of the good ol' days of gaming (retro). Twerps. Maybe in the audience next time you could add some scantily-clad women (because when I used to bullfight there would be ladies in the crowd displaying breasts). It was Spain so we called them ""señoritas"". Maybe you Americans would benefit from immersion in another culture, instead of bathing in your mountain dew and baby sweat and tears because Mom turned off the Nintendo.P.S. Your ♥♥♥♥ing tiny, dweebs. Lilliputian homunculi.So peace out, you rat-chasing, dust farming, pint-sized tiny♥♥♥♥s. That's right you shrimpy ant-dicked grass men.			"
