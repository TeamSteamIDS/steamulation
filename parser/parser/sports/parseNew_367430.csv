												Can't you beat your friends in table tennis or air hockey? Fear no more, Redshift Blueshift is here to give you the equality!  Now you can use some tricks and a shiny screen to beat them easily. (Uhm.. maybe they can still beat you since they are good at reading your moves.)  Pros:+10/10 Balance+Suitable for e-sports ( The game has no online multiplayer, though.)+No pre-defined skill level at multiplayer. It can be super hardcore or super casual depending on you and your friend.+Catchy audioCons:-Sometimes AI feels like unbeatable at singleplayer. It can annoy casual players.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: HYPYRYLPublishers: HYPYRYL Initial release: Sept 2015Genre: E-sports, Competitive, Action #Worth/NotWorth: #Worth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationESPORTS! This is a fast paced very frantic versus battle of Breakout for 1 or 2 players. Initially it may seem very chaotic and a bit hard to track everything going on, especially as you are supposed to shoot the things that are the same color which at first is a bit counter intuitive but very quickly is easily acclimated to. The main objective is to make the other person unable to hit the ball back and not to shoot things (that is a secondary objective again, which is at first also counter intuitive.) Each time the ball hits the top of the screen it switches colors; During this transition your ship will be a paddle or a ship. The paddle means it's your point to lose. The ship means defend yourself against tertiary enemies or pop power ups to distract your opponent.There is a 1 player mode vs. an AI controlled opponent which with each win at a higher difficulty unlocks a new AI at an even higher difficulty, you can also unlock ships that way which have slightly varying porperties. The 2 player mode is extremely balanced perfect for all your try hard couch co-op esports leagues. Low barrier of entry but hard to master. From time to time I found myself staring at a focal point in the screen and only using my peripheral vision to track 2 or 3 items simultaneously. There is even a very easily accessed dead zone scaler (changes the amount of area you must move the joystick before an input is actually taken, mostly to avoid excess drifting for lose joysticks) for those of you who may have some older gamepads or joysticks like myself. The soundtrack is rad, super great music and sound effects. Reminded me of “Luftrausers” Very reminiscent of games like Niddhogg, Capsule Force and the like. Quite enjoyable.Follow my curation for more "

												Competitive games are not my thing. Be they hardcore like CS:GO or stupid fun like Mount Your Friends, I can barely enjoy myself for little over an hour before I get bored of whats offered.Redshift Blueshift is not one of those games. Best described as raquetball in space with pong style ball physics and shmup components, it's a game that demands your attention and challenges you from your first step. There are three ships to unlock through defeating the four levels of AI, coming with their customary advantages and disadvantages. In a game, there are three potential drops; shields, missles, and some floaty eye dude that shoots big ole bullets. The latter two may not seem much at first, but they can spell an end to a match fairly quickly if you don't take them out quick enough or use them to your advantage. They also contribute to the screen filling up insanely quickly with projectiles and explosions, making it easy to lose the ball if you get too caught up in the pretty effects. On top of the projectiles slowing you down, the distracting nature of these helps bely the small nature of the court, and once the ball picks up speed, matches make or break your ability to adapt.The frenetic pace of each game (consisting of either 3 matches to 10 depending on your preference and masochism) means even the most drawn out and rough contests will only last 5 to 10 minutes. For any other game this would be bad. Real bad. However, the addictiveness and the challenge presented means it take mere nanoseconds to start a new game and jump in again. As of now I've only clocked in about 45 minutes, but I'm itching to wipe out the final AI and gather up all those sweet sweet steam achievements. Coupled with some nice local co-op, RSBS has a lot of longetivity. Sadly, there is no news on matchmaking or competitive online...anything yet, but I'd be all over it if they ever made it. So far, there are just leaderboards, and for now I shall take pride in my as of now number 30 spot. I have no doubt I will sink lower as time goes on, but I will love every second anyway.With flawless controls, a wide variety of challenges, wonderful chiptunes and a helping of trading cards, this lovely little title is something special indeed. For less than a combo meal at a fast food joint, this game is absolutely, undeniably worth your time.  "

												Simply brilliant! or brilliantly simple. Once again proof that sometimes the simple game ideas are the best. This game takes pong and adds a little shmup elements to it to bring forth a very speedy ping-pong game between two ships.  Shooting enemies, explosions and (if enabled) shaking screen makes hitting the ball harder. Local multiplayer potential is also very high as learning curve is low.			"

												Redshift Blueshift is the type of game that you would get if you combined Pong with a shoot 'em up. In the game you control a spaceship that also works as a paddle. You need to hit the ball when it is your turn. When it is the other player's turn you can shoot powerups that either give you an advantage or hurt your opponent.I had some fun with Redshift Blueshift. While the game has a single player mode I would recommend playing against another player since the computer difficulty levels are either too hard or too easy. While I enjoyed the game I wish the powerups had more of an effect on the game. For the most part you are just playing a game of Pong with the occasional instance where a power up actually influences the game. The only other problem I had with the game is that it is the type of game that you are only going to want to play in short doses. Redshift Blueshift is not the type of game that you are going to play for hours at a time.  If you like Pong I think you will enjoy Redshift Blueshift. Note: I received a free review copy of the game from the developer. Read My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com] "

												This game is amazing. You play a little spaceship with a ball that bounces on walls, breakout/pong style. Every time the ball bounces off the top, the color (and therefor the person who must hit the ball) changes. So far, pretty nice game with pretty graphics and nice music. But then, there's these little cubes that drop from the top colored to your ship. When you hit them, they do one of three things:1. release 3 missiles that target the other player but turn slowly2. spawn a turret that moves around slowly and fires white spheres that can hit both players, but are aimed at the opposing player3. a shield that absorbs one hit from a missle or above mentioned white sphereWhen you get hit, you're stunned for a moment and can't move. At first, this doesn't seem all that bad, but if you get hit at the wrong time, then you can't bounce the ball, and your opponent gains a point. Because of this, strategy is not simple. This game elegantly combines both skill (in being able to hit the ball in the way you want) and quick thinking strategy. All in all, worth the money ten times over. I can't wait for network multiplayer.			"

Redshift Blueshift is a local-multiplayer arcade game that's equal parts Pong and old-school shmup. Originally conceived for the game jam, Ludum Dare 30[ludumdare.com], this Steam release sees enhanced graphics, tougher AI, controller support, and various other polished nuances. The game is simple; two spaceships volley a hyper-ball back and forth until one misses. Along the way, players can shoot canisters to send drones or missles to their opponent, or equip shields to protect themselves. It's fast, chaotic, and totally fun. Usually, it's hard for me to have fun playing a local-multiplayer game alone. However, I can confidently say that it delivers a pretty fun single player experience, and the AI definitely impressed me. The game starts you off at an easy pace, letting you learn the game and how to handle your ship. As you get better and beat the computer, new difficulties are unlocked, testing your skills with a blend of twitchy movement and fine ball-control. This game can easily appeal to casual and hardcore players alike; it's really easy to pick up for a game or two or challenge yourself to unlock all of the achievements. Also, if you're super competitive, you can shoot for the highest score on its global leaderboards (which is no easy feat, speaking from experience). Graphically, the game uses charming pixel art that's easy to read during the frenetic gameplay, along with character portraits that even taunt when one player makes a mistake. However, the experience wouldn't be as good without its amazing soundtrack[01010111.bandcamp.com]. It's an awesome combination of chiptune and rock and makes all the action even more exciting.The biggest draw for me is the price. I honestly feel that $8.99 is a little steep for what feels like a $5 game. I ended up getting a copy from IndieGameStand[indiegamestand.com] for $1, and it's definitely a great addition to anybody's game library. Players also might be frustrated with the lack of content that there really is. Still, you will definitely get more than a few hours' worth from its single-player campaign against a well-designed AI opponent. If price is a huge factor for you, I'd suggest waiting for a sale. I also recommend having a buddy around; I've had some of the most fun games just playing against my little sister. Redshift Blueshift is an amazing love letter to 80's/90's era anime, videogames, and music. This game is a great gem to play, and I highly recommend it. TL; DR: For fans of Lethal League, Nidhogg, and other competitive couch multiplayer games.			"

												I never thought space pong would be this much fun! Played this from the Groupees bundle that gave it in the past and have been loving it. Casual enouhg to relax and play but competitive enougn to make you want to win. Get some crazy ball speeds and angles and you got yourself an equivalent of two pong masters doing trickshots just to have fun. Definitely a reccomendation from me. Whether a quick time-sink or just something to play this is definitely a game you should pick up. It's simple, it's easy, and amazingly fun to play.			"

												I initially bought this game for incredibly cheap on Itch.IO, and actually considered repurchasing it at full price because I'd loved it so much... But let's get into my history with it.I first encountered this madness at MAGfest 2015, and I sucked at it. I sucked HARD. But I decided that, even if I sort of sucked, it was still a good game. So I left magfest with the little card directing me to Itch (but not the poster. I lost it.) and eventually bought the game and soundtrack for three bucks. I know, I'm cheap. So I played it against the AI, got good, and beat a few friends at it, even upvoting this sucker on greenlight when it came up there. I was so excited about this, but... I got a little busy and before I knew it, it'd been out for a whole month, and I just hadn't noticed the email with my code.As for the game itself, it's INTENSE. Two ships, bouncing a ball against the top of the screen as it goes faster and faster. Firing at powerup boxes, trying to ensure that the other guy gets swarmed with missiles and drones, listening to some sweet chiptunes. Watching the pilots taunt each other, making your own banter with your human opponents. The ball keeps going faster, the screen fills with more and more danger, you feel the beat pick up, and... You probably discover that your friend's getting good at this.On a final note, the game's seen a lot of changes and improvements. The AI, once barely able to play a novice, now has multiple difficulty settings, and is actually really hard to beat. The taunts can be toggled on and off, just in case you don't like them. The gameplay feels a little updated, more flowy and smooth somehow.Do I recommend it? Yes, but just keep in mind that it's best played against humans. Do I think it needs any additions? Maybe. I still don't see an option to have first player be blue pilot, and I much prefer playing as him. Maybe more ships could be added. But as it is, it's still a rad game. No regrets whatsoever.			"

												Had the pleasure of meeting the developers of the game at EGX and I must admit I had a little bias going into the game, due to the developers raw passion and likeability. I definitely wanted to enjoy the game so was worried that may cloud my judgement initially, however upon playing the game and noting its simple yet effective gameplay, there wasn't too much for me to deliberate over. The real question is was it fun?The game is a 2-D pixel-art Shmup/Air Hockey hybrid (and if that combination hasn't at least garned your curiosity I dont know what to say) and is most enjoyable for my tastes in its split screen multiplayer. The rules of the game are simple, the outcome often quite the opposite, with chaotic fast-paced plays and exhilirating back and forths that'll have you shouting at the top of your lungs one way or another. As the ball bounces between each players spaceship, the rapidity of the game increases, as does the tension as one simple slip up could cost you a round. Power ups matching the color of each ship will appear on screen and can be shot down to recieve power-ups such as shields and offensive turnouts, perhaps one of my few gripes with the game would be that I would like to see more creativity in said powerups as they could add more versatility to the experience. I understand that a barrage of power-ups could over complicate the experience however. An online option would also be most appreciated, as I personally feel the need to show off my skills to the public as I am the try-hardiest of tryhards but nonetheless the devs have crafted a wonderful title for their first outing on steam and I sincerely wish them the best of luck as Red Shift Blue Shift shows a great deal of promise!

												I'm not big into casual gaming and I'm just a little too young to feel nastalgia for Pong and arcade games of this era, So retro games don't appeal to me, but I was recommended this by a friend.It's fast-paced, and the difficulty levels change the dynamics drastically. It won't be a relaxed game of Pong with some Alien Invasion elements; it's mellowest moments will still have you seeking powerups, watching for the ball to bounce back, and watching for enemy powerups.I have yet to play with a human, but I'm sure it makes for a fun game on local co-op, much like arcade games would. I recommend it because it is replayable, challenging and fun!			"

												An excellent arcade style action game. Fast and chaotic yet finely tuned and responsive. The game's concept is straightforward enough to pick up and play quickly with friends, but mastering the timing and technique required to play against the difficult A.I. (or experienced human opponents) takes much longer.The game is playable in one or two player mode, though I've found it also works very well with more players trading off in local tournament style, as the increasing speed between points keeps the rounds short and intense.The game also features some great tunes, a bright and well animated pixelart style, and steam achievements to add extra challenges for both one and two player mode.

												This game is very easy to pick up and learn. The controls are very simple. It is best played with a controller, and it even recommends you do so as the game loads, however you can get by with a key board. My first time playing it was with the key board and I managed to survive my first round through against the computer. However I would admit that the game play was much more smooth and enjoyable once I tried it with the controller.Don’t hesitate … jump on this game now … you will not regret it. It is a great experience alone or with friends. We played on both a MAC and PC, both had a smooth gameplay.You can see my full review at http://www.confidentgamers.com/one-ship-two-ships-redshift-blueshift-review/ "
