												I ended up returning this game. The user interface was garbage and it was hard to tell what I could pick or not for character before starting the game. There is no guide as to what buttons do what for the characters. Some didn't seem to do anything other than one thing while others did a special related to thier sport. Even without all those issues which were really bad the game just didn't feel like it would be fun. I will admit to not actually getting to play it with others before I returned it.			"

												Although I haven't even played it enough to even see what the game has offered, you can obviouslly tell that this is just a port of a console game. No config, no tutorial (even though it doesn't really need one, as it's pretty easy to learn). I unfortunately did not have a friend at the time to play this with, let alone know the keyboard controls (since there are no options or guides anywhere, even online). I mean heck, even some of the worst games I've ever played at least had an option to change the music and sound settings.I could honestly see some people getting into this, but until there's some kind of patch or update, it's not really worth it.I can't really give this a fair rating, unfortunately. Once I continue, I might update this review. So far it seems like a good game with wasted (or rather unused) potential.			"
