												Not a bad little puzzle game, fairly easy starting out till you get the hang of it, then really starts to get crazy.Click the black brick to make it vanish and figure out what combonation of explosions and brick falls will make that ball glide ever so sweetly across the goal line.Simple, tricky, and explosions, football for my blokes out there, kind-of. 67 levels and counting, pick it up on sale, it's a good pass time and can definately keep you occupied.
