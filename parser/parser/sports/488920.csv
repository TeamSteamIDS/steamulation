Early Access Review
								Have you played Punch-Out in the past? This game is Punch-Out in VR!My first impression after having played through the tutorial, beat the 1st and 2nd enemy, and failed against the third enemy twice: fantastic game, achieves what it wants to do (Punch-Out in VR), highly polished visuals, very active combat.If you expect to get a realistic boxing game, then this isn't for you (there is an octopus as an enemy...an octopus!). But if you enjoy a pattern-recognition based arcade boxing game that requires you to pay attention, be quick on your feet/block reactively, then this game is for you!If you want a semi-realistic boxing game, then Thrill of The Fight may be a better game for you (can't recommend Kunlun Fighting, is significantly worse than Thrill of the Fight). This game and Thrill of the Fight stand in two separate game genre's even if they superficially seem to belong to the ""boxing"" genre.Knockout League allows you to dodge, however, you also have to counter quickly to get a hit in. The game doesn't require much space as it wants you to dodge sideways rather than backwards.You can also block enemies' attacks by timing it. If you block too early, you won't be allowed to counter back. This makes the game a lot more exciting!Currently the game's difficulty level is ramping up quickly and it is unlikely that you will be able to beat all enemies in one go. This is actually a good thing and you'll notice that with repeated matches that you simply get better and better to read the enemies' actions beforehand and overcoming such a challenge is always satisfying.There are still a few minor bugs I've encountered that are already mentioned in the early access page above.I can recommend this game to anyone that liked Punch-Out, likes more active VR games and people enjoying challenging fights.(This review will be edited after playing more of the game and if content patches change up the game significantly in the future)			"

								Tried it for a few minutes.  Went through the training, then got knocked out after a minute or so with the first fighter.Very good graphics, feels like a VR first person version of Street Fighter or something.  I really wish it was possible to set the starting position in each fight, the default one fits my playspace very poorly and makes the game hard to play.			"

								Just fired it up for some training and a few rounds.First impression:  Already the most polished and fun boxing experience in VR.  Just as much exercise and immersion as Thrill of the Fight, but it feels like a full-on game with training area, some character customization, fleshed-out environments, etc.Also:  be ready for a workout like with Thrill of the Fight.  You'll be ducking, dodging and dancing even on the first fight.			"

								I was pretty excited for this game but it was a big letdown. The game does not deliever what it promises. First, it is not room scale. You can not move around-- only duck. So why would it need room scale?  Next, they promise 1:1 punching movements. Yes, it tracks your gloves nicely, but you aren't able to freely attack. You have to wait for pre-determined moves which repeat over and over then punch. The game would be more fun and has better replayability if it was more random and fluid. Pass.			"

								Pros: - Punching is on point! - Blocking is on point! - Dodging is on point! - Opponents are really awesome! - Art style is great! - Excellent workout! - Amazingly optimized!Cons:                      - Boundaries can be a nuisance (devs fixed within 24 hours!!!) - Missing some content shown in the trailer (training mini games) - Only 4 fights so farOverall for an early access game this is a must experience. Dont expect this to give you too much playtime just yet. But what is here is definitely worth the experience. As i said this will now be one of my go to games for demoing my Vive to new people. Also cant stress how polished this feels. I played with supersampling up to 1.5 and i felt i could push it even further!			"

								Edited Due to update fixing everything.You can set how far forward or back you are now. My only reccomendation is maybe putting a little cicle or ghost of where your opponent will be when you are setting this. Otheriwse this was the exact fix I was looking for and honestly a lot of games, (Fruit Ninja for example) could use a similar option. Great work by the devs!FYI, I am working with the smallest allowed room space by Steam VR and I have plenty of space in front and behind me.Characters look great and solid, great sense of depth, runs well, functions as it says it does, with a minor bug here and there they already seem to be patching out.I have seen people complain that there are only 4 fights. Which is understandable. But the game is only $20, which by VR prices is low. Fucntionally it works. And, after just one fight, its exhausting. You do a lot of ducking, leaning, punching, and fights are longer than I expected. Honestly, 4 fights for me is okay, but maybe put in a hard mode where it takes 2x as long. I think I could be satisfied with that.I reccomended it before they patched it, and now it will be definitely be a game I will demo for friends trying VR. Its simple, functional, and fun.			"

Granted I can't get past the second fighter but it is so much fun!  I don't know what people expected.  If you loved Punch Out on the NES then you will love this game!

Plays like Punch Out- block and dodge, learn patterns, punch the weak spots. The characters are well designed, the game is pretty, even the trainer is pretty likeable. It's not cheap, but worth the price (assuming content keeps being added.)			"

								I have been following this game for a while now.  The mixed reality trailer was very appealing, but I was curious how the gameplay was in VR.  I must say, the game is actually even better when you put on the headset.  The characters have a believable presence in the game, and the arcade style mechanics are nicely balanced.  Although I haven't beat Crimson Fang yet, i'm dying to get to the Octopus.  Props to the developer for making a great VR experience.			"

								At present, the best boxing game. As long as the fire men to find a single action on the grid and then counter attack can easily beat him, leopard female attack is more common to be able to block her attacks in a row to beat him. Each enemy's weaknesses are not the same, some of the actions of the front swing can be interrupted directly. The pirate captain with cold weapon so invalid block to find the opportunity to beat him and then back to dodge, octopus brother is the pirate captain simple personally I think after all some can block, but some of the best four claw attack only after dodge. I recorded the game Raiders but friends do not practice it.http://www.bilibili.com/video/av9014128/http://www.bilibili.com/video/av9239291/ "

								I had a lot of fun with the 2 first fights, the blocking system of this game is excellent, the problem is that when you know how to beat an oponnent you will never lose as they always do the same attacks so after follow the sequence correctly you win, I guess that it will not be a problem when the game is complete with enough fighters, so I'm not giving a bad review for that.My review is due to the awfull dodge system, to dodge you have to go to a determinate direction, each enemy can attack from 5 directions and you can dodge to 5 directions, the game track your movement not your position so if you go to the correct side it will count as a dodge even if you get hit in game, but if you go to the wrong side it counts as a hit even if you are miles away fro the enemie punch. You cannot block the 3rd fighter and for me is almost impossible know how to dodge him, sometimes I get hit and sometimes I don't, I try to go to the logic side when I see him coming but I still get hit, I tried to beat him for 1 hour and end up frustrated because there is no way to use the logic when someone is spaming hits and you cannot dodge any of them,  you don't know if it is because you are going to the wrong side or you are doing a bad timing. I just give up and will return the game.			"

								The game is in a strange state, it is very fun, but that fun is only temporary. It will keep you busy for a few days, until you beat the 4 (widely varied and interesting characters) by learning their specific moves, unfortunely, then the game falls flat on its face. This game has no replay value. Like at all. In its current state there is no unlockables, and the 4 enemies take about 2-4 hours to learn and beat. After that theres nothing else to do. For 20 dollars, id wait until they announce unlockables or other characters before buying.			"

								It's fun, but the video is misleading. There are no training mini games involving bags. They're grayed out. The only training is mit work with the trainer. The game is pretty hard. I couldn't beat the second boxer, a woman, during my first 30 min. You can't fight the next two boxers until you beat her. There are four total. I don't recall seeing a life bar. It seemed like you had to hit the opponent perfectly in a set sequence to knock him/her down. I prefer a life bar that you can whittle down over time. Assuming this gets more content, it's worth it.Update: I've played this for 1.2 hours and have beaten all four boxers and done the training twice. 1st boxer: Beat twice on first attempt (update lost my save, so fought him again)2nd boxer: Took 3 attempts to beat3rd boxer: Took 3 attempts to beat (watched a guy beat him, then beat him myself)4th boxer: Took 1 attempt to beat			"

								This game can be in the future as one of the best VR games, nice cartoon graphics and visuals in general, carismatic oponents, nice music, you feel like you are in a dangerous and funny boxing combat, but it has very critical issues, like you must stay still on one point of your play area even if you have set up room scale you should stay on that spot the whole time and the spot is on the back edge of your chaperone, in my case I have a wardrobe few centimeters far from the chaperone limit. The other issue is that the oponents are doing constantly the same moves and the worse is that when you know all the oponent attacks, you can get the dodge position seconds before the oponent does the attack, it make you feel very silly keeping your body bended until your oponent finish its attack. At the moment I not recomend this game, it needs so much improvements to be just good.			"

			Knockout league is a virtual reality boxing game where you defeat your opponents by figuring out their rhythm patterns in order to land hits.		

I was really excited for this game to come out. When it did I kept hearing a bunch of mixed things. My first impression of the game was great; the first fight was super fun and i was excited for the next one. After that it was just exhausting for me and it's when I came to the realization that this game is rhthym/pattern based. You can't land any hits unless its during a certain part of the pattern they run where they are vulnerable. I'd choose Thrill of the Fight over this one.			"

								I want to start by saying the art in this game is excellent. The characters are interesting and fun to watch and the animations make it fell like Mike Tyson's Punch Out VR.Unfortunately it doesn't feel like this game takes advantage of touch controls. Boxing feels more like button mashing through arm flailing than anything else. Dodging is more about making the correct ducking motion than instinctually getting out of the way of in incoming swing.I see what the devs were going for, and I have hopes that this game will get there. In its current state however, I find it more exhausting than fun.			"

Graphics are good, and the characters are entertaining. However, ther are things that are really frustrating with this game that I have decided to abandon it at the moment. The tracking is good enough, but it is as if the game is designed to allow you to hit the opponent only at specific moments, which totally changes your perception of the game, and changes fun into frustration. You see your gloves hitting the character's ungarded body parts, yet nothing happens, and the game only allows you to hit at specific time points, otherwize you waste your energy and build up sweat, much like punching thin air!

Some negatives... - Game starts off with you wearing gloves in opposite hands. Nothing major but it's annoying having to remove wrist straps just to swap controllers.- Pricey for a short game with only 4 opponents, but it's in early access so more to come.- Can't change graphic settings until after tutorial and it starts on the lowest settings.- During tutorial if you hit your trainer he gets upset and repeats his lines from the beginning.Overall a fun game but not worth the asking price.

								Got this refunded after a couple of goes. Beyond the surface, which is decent, the game itself is really dull. The problem; the opponents follow a set pattern, and it's not varied, it's a short sequence where they build up to their attack, you then dodge or block and only then can you hit back. You throw a few punches and you repeat the process.It's not dynamic, you oberserve this obvious sequence and keep repeating until you win. This gets repetive quickly. Fine for the first hour, but hardly offering much longevity. Sure it's early access but you can see this is the mechanic they're going for here, where good graphics paper over a rather bland experience.Worth it for a fiver at best.			"

								ok, so this is a literal VR version of punch-out. except punch-out was fun.here's how it works thus far: you stand in the center of the ring. if you move your head with the proper level of intensity, which isn't really well explained, you will trigger a dodge. the dodge is apparently invisible, so you can't tell if you triggered it too early, too late, or not at all. while your punches are 1:1, the animations are not - you can get punched even if the punch animation is nowhere near your head. this becomes obvious if you try to step out of the way instead of move your head.if you're imagining moving around the ring and really using that room-scale, you can't. your opponent will stubbornly stand in the center of the ring and stare at the circle you are supposed to be in. it's kind of like boxing a gif. he won't follow you like an actual boxer, he won't try to guide you back to the middle of your play space (but you will get a helpful error demanding you return to the fight if you move too far away). he will just stand there and throw punches at the location you're supposed to be in, and you will have to ""dodge"" them. you have to try very hard to not shatter the illusion that you're in a ring.while i get that there's some safety aspect here, i think this ended up being the worst of all worlds. i can't recommend this game unless they seriously re-think the gameplay, because right now i feel like the nes version of this is more immersive (and fun).

								An arcade style punch game, very polished but also feels extremely limited. Don't recommend unless you really enjoy turn based fight system with no room scale movement. I have a strong feeling that I can play this game with keyboard or xbox controller without much difference. The graphics is very polished, maybe the most polished as a vr combat game, but there are so many polished non-vr games out there and this game don't have the vr only contents that worth putting on the headset. This game looks like a PSVR game rather than vive game, although it is supported by ' vive studio'.Hope I can turn this to a big thumb up after some big update one day.			"

								Just get Thrill of the Fight.  This is a boxing game where you can't punch your opponents.  Yes, that's right, you can *only* counter them!  Also, the game is not room scale.  You are required to stay in a specific area of the ring and wait for them to come to you.  If you exceed their boundary limits, the game will halt.For a game that advertises ""1:1 punch movement that lets you attack how you want."", that's a total load of baloney.  They will block every jab you take at them.Basically, you must read their super-slow telegraphed attack, remember what you're required to do (dodge, punch, or block) and then swat at them quickly and aimlessly like a catfight.  Forget about perfectly executed hooks, uppercuts, overhead smashes, body blows, etc.There's also something weird about the game: There are only four opponents, and the coach and first two weakest opponents are all black: an old black coach, a huge dumb Mike Tyson-like boxer and a black ""jungle woman"".  Wouldn't it be weird if the first three characters you encountered in a game were all Slavic, or Latino, or Asian, or [fill in a random race here]?  It would be different if the remaining two boxers were of somewhat proportional balance, but instead we have a white pirate and a octopus.  So we have three black people, a white pirate, and an octopus to punch at.  It struck me as a bit weird, like a stereotype of who participates in boxing.  I'll let you come to your own conclusions.If you want an uninteresting reaction game, this is your game.  If you want a boxing game, get Thrill of the Fight.  I had such high hopes for this, but it's a child's game pretending to be about boxing.			"

								Great graphics, but that is about it.  This is more a pattern recognition game than it is a boxing game.  Can't box or hit until they begin a static action/ The game does not deliever what it promises. First, it is not room scale. You can not move around-- only duck. So why would it need room scale? You have to wait for pre-determined moves which repeat over and over then punch. The game would be more fun and has better replayability if it was more random and fluid.   Could be great if it was more like boxing game.			"

								Very Frustrating Game, NEEDS in game Tut -on blocking. I can't figure out how to PROPERLY Block, so i always get hit. NOT A FUN GAME.  REFUND until they update the game with a LOGIAL TUTORIAL SESSION.Pros: Great Graphics, AudioCons: Controls/Gameplay are very confusing, (i've played 100+ VR games) making the user feel lost and not enjoyable at ALL. Much better boxing games than this 1.			"

								Oculus Owner here! Works great with the Rift, it doesn't seem to use the 3rd sensor, so if you're having 360* tracking issues (360 tracking is still in experimental phase at this point so give Oculus a break) I don't think it matters here. I didn't have the need to turn around at all in the first two fights. So if it does come to it in the final two fights, I'll update the review. At this point, you're good with two sensors 180* tracking (which isn't a problem on the Rift) and you're fine with 3+ sensors because it doesn't seem to need the back sensors at all. It seems really early access at this stage. Only 4 opponents, and it's really just a, ""Memorize their pattern"" game. If you don't block or dodge at that time you don't get an opening and the opening is just on punch until you get enough punches to daze the opponent in which you get to do muliple punches on them. It's incredibly basic at this point, and if it wasn't in VR it'd be a terrible game! It has a ton of potential, I recommend it. And please don't refund it, the developers need to continue developing this game. It needs variety in fighting style and it needs to not be a scripted fight, meaning they do the same thing over and over until you memorize what they're gonna do.  "

								Keeping this review short: If you love Punch Out!, this game is for you. This is Punch-Out Done Right!There is only 4 characters to fight right now but it took me an hour to beat the first 2 characters. It is pretty much almost everything you love about Punch-Out gameplay, except that you can't dodge backwards, but it is still all about learning the different attack patterns and timing your blocks to be effective. A great workout and it is fun and challenging to learn when to counter-attack.Do not compare it to Thrill of the Fight.  They are the same genre (boxing) but this game is more about fun Punch-out gameplay mechanics than realism.Looking forward to more characters and future updates. If you've been imagining what Punch Out in VR would be like, buy now and find out.			"

								So far I've only played through the training tutorial and the first fight with Tri-Tip.  By the end of the fight I was covered in sweat and out of breath.  Very fun.  I hope the devs allow those of us with large spaces to use our room scale set-ups.  Also, you have to play through the entire tutorial on lowest settings.  So hopefully they patch that soon.  Very promising start!  Can't wait to fight my next opponent tonight!			"

								Punch out, VR styleThis was a great purchase for me since I love boxing.  You will definately get a good arm/shoulder work out with this game.  I've played quite a few matches already and still havent beaten the 2nd boxer - Crimson Fang.  Graphics in the game is definately polished and easy to get in and out on the menus.  Its a brand new title so they are still adding more stuff and hopefully more boxers.  Im definately looking forward and hoping to see a Multiplayer menu added in the future.  Keep up the great work guys!!!			"

								  I have to say a great vr game. Just like everybody is saying its like Punch out in VR. You have to dodge and weave based on there tells just like punch-out. Each match is not just a couple of min though so BE PREPARED TO SWEAT! Its a good little workout and heck of alot of fun.			"

								A+ For Presentation. If Nintendo were producing VR Punch-Out I couldn't imagine it looking far different from this.Unfountately I think the Hit Detection is way unfinished. It's just annoying for the game to claim I've been punched when I was ducking. I don't know maybe I'm supposed to dodge RIGHT before the opponent is punching but still when the game says I've been hit I want a Fist flying into my face.Maybe it's a height problem or something but until then I have to say BUY THIS GAME WITH CAUTION. For now Thrill of the Fight remains my favorite boxing game for the simple reason that it feels right.I'm going to hold onto my purchase and hope the devs work on this, but I hope this game feels far better when released.

								I don't make reviews often, if at all. This game is amazing. If you grew up playing Punch Out and loved the Wii version, you will love Knockout League.This is a very similar game in that it's got stylized characters that have patterns of attacks you have to figure out via punching, dodging and blocking. I really wish you could dodge backwards for certain punches.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is amazing! It has supplanted SwordMasterVR as my favorite physical combat game. And don't be fooled by the videos - this game might look ""cute"" but it is intensely physical to play, and feels viscerally violent. If it were too much more realistic it might be too much, really. Opponent sophistication: I've unlocked the second opponent-character so far, and haven't managed to beat her after several attempts (which doesn't get old because after every time you manage to hit her enough times in a row to daze her, she adds another set of moves to her repertoire). Exercise factor: I find as I get really into this, it starts to feel natural to put real force behind the punches, all of them. When I'm doing it, my brain thinks I'm actually fighting (despite the fact my opponent is this sort of early-Pixar-looking crude 3D model). This definitely elevated my heart rate and breathing to levels consistent with a hard sprint, and kept it there - to the extent that I start getting hit because fatigue or lack of breath is slowing down my reaction times. Also, despite being pretty athletic I find my shoulders, traps, and obliques are extremely sore after about an hour of play. Also my feet. Experience/realism: The haptic feedback is extremely well timed with the sound effects and the visualization of the impact (theopponent jerking back, etc). I can't quite describe how visceral it is. You really get this jolt of adrenaline and a sense of satisfaction when you land a hit, or especially a series of hits. This is an extremely well put together melee combat mechanic that motivates real physical investment in the fight while also requiring quick thinking to figure out how to beat opponents.Room scale / other considerations: I am fully utilizing my play space dodging and rushing not just with my body but with my feet. A lot. If you wear shoes, you'll make a LOT of noise. If you wear socks, you slide around. Barefoot, I had best footing. But be warned, if you aren't used to that, the fast lunges and dodging around will be very hard on the feet - particularly around the edges and the pads of the toes (blisters or friction burns on all of them).I'm really looking forward to beating this person so I can see what interesting characters the other two early access characters are like. GREAT GAME!Now ---- the wishlist:1. Multiplayer. Obviously. I don't care if I can't see my opponent's legs, or they don't have special moves. Just the block/rush/dodge/duck/swing mechanism is enough (with voice chat...that's really essential) to let people interact in this way.2. At some point, you're going to need to have the characters start learning. I suggest you have them start throwing the player's own punches at them (exactly the glove movements relative to their head...when they reach a certain proximity). And then record how the player reacts (how they move to dodge it, or if they block it, and what kind of follow up punch they attempt). And then have the character make exactly that reaction when a similar punch movement is tracked. You might have to slow it down a bit (at least when first introducing the move) and gradually speed it up. Then the player will actually be learning good reflexes.3. Special moves. Pleeeeease? With really cool special effects and the announcer calling it out, etc. It doesn't have to be unrealistic street fighter stuff (though...wouldn't that be fun). Just cool things similar to what the characters get. Like an unblockable punch (with a long wind-up). Or a fast combo (that your trainer teaches you at some point, when you unlock it) that makes your gloves catch on fire.4. Why don't WE get to be announced and have some cool showboating gimmick that the crowd goes wild for? When I saw we were picking our nicknames by selecting one word from each of two lists, I thought that was the idea (since you could combine ""Beast"" (roaring) with ""Wicked"" (with hellfire or a pentagram or something) so that when the announcer calls ""in this corner, the Wicked Beast"" I'd see flames rising around me in a star shape and a load roar. Or whatever.Anyways, I hope any or all of those end up part of the completed game. I'll definitely be playing this in easy access while I wait!			"

								I have quite a few games in my collection and I am always on the lookout for something a bit different and that has potential. Reading that this game is from an HTC owned devloper I thought it should be good, an it is!I am not a sports or boxing fan, and am rubbish at any kind of sports in real life, but this game doesnt need any interest or  commitment to this or any sport, just an enthusiasm to enjoy knocking seven bells out of an opponent and dodge.It's an awesome feeling to knock an opponent out. The abilty to hit as hard as you want without hurting anyone and making yourself fitter makes this a must buy if you want to use your Vive to shed a few pounds.I love this game and am lookng forward to its completion. True boxing afficianados may not love it, as its not a serious boxing simulator (you can fight an octopus!), but most people who choose to actually buy should not be disappointed. Steam will refund you if you really dont like it anyway, so whats there to lose.			"
