												The tagline should be ""World okayest online multiplayer snooker game!"", and that's being kind, and if the game was for iOS/Android. No graphic options so literally everything is either blurry or heavily pixelated. I was expecting something like Yahoo Pool, I used to love that game! Easy to pick up and play when you have a spare 10 minutes or so, but no. The physics aren't that great and when played online it felt like I was playing the AI. "

												This game lacks luster .snooker 147 was more fun .still for any snooker fan , its the only choice available on steam .this game should show the steam profile of people we are playing with or they just seem like bots.dev should improve graphics . the game feels slow and dull			"

												Personally, I think this game is excellent and completely disagree with the negative reviews.Here's why:If you open the volume mixer when the game is running to turn down the insanely loud royalty free music, you will see the game titled in the mixer as it should have been titled on steam.It should simply be known as;SNOKDont believe me?Click this[s29.postimg.org] "

												So, this game. Un-installed almsot straight away. Was looking through the files for the audio tracks, one or two seemed alright to listen to when say on blender or something. I found the sfx files and included was files called ""sex1"" and ""sex2"" and can confirm they are exactly what they are called. Why are these included on a snooker game? did the developer forget to take out his hidden stash upon launch? it's a snooker game.... pathetic.			"
