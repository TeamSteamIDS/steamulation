								all these positive reviews are getting out of hand! this is a tech demo and NOT a game and shouldve been released as such!punching has very little visual effect on the sparring partner, they dont wince when punched in the side.head doesnt snap when uppercutted, or ANY visible signs of trama! youre literally punching the air! now youre doing that techincally anyway but its disturbung when i cant punch what im looking at.the blocking seems non existant and i see NO indicators when or IF im blocking. this shouldve been released with an IN DEPTH TUTORIAL, animations that are akin to what youre physically doing etc.you guys need to be more resposible with these reviews!!!

								It looks awesome, there is still much work to be done, but if you like fighting/training, when Thrill of the Fight was not enough for you, i strongly recommend you to get this one.			"

								This is a fast paced boxing game that has alot of potential. The reason I call it a boxing game is because it lacks the ability to allow the user to kick as well as punch. Though, I am positive this could be added in the near future by the deves with the use of the Vive Tracker https://www.vive.com/us/vive-tracker/. Over all, I like this game and I think it is an awesome way to get in a quick workout.			"
