												Fantastic! As soon as i saw it memories of the good old commodore 64 came flooding back. I was a little sceptical when buying because it looks so different. But having played only an hour it retains the atmosphere of the commodore 64 with so much more depth. If you are old enough to remember the commodore 64 version and you loved it then this is a must buy! I can see me putting 8hour stints into this game and can't wait to get into it. Well done devs!

												Great if you are interested in dog racing. I don't think there is another greyhound management game like it. Actualy the management side of things is quite lite which I prefer. Basicaly you get your dogs fit and race them and try to get them a higher grading and bet on the races to make money to buy new dogs. You can then breed your own dogs later. Personaly I like to dip into this game now and again and have done for years. I'm hoping one day there will be a GM3 but for now this will do! The fun is in working out which dog will win a race by looking through the dogs previous form and then watching the race and collecting you betting winnings. The races are plain and basic 2D but nicely realistic. I guess the plus side to this is it should run on most PC's without a problem. The dog racing has graded races and handicaps and also jumps races. There are rounds (quarter finals, semi finals and finals) to the big races so it's not easy winning one of these races with your hounds but the prize money makes it worth attemting and it's very satisfying yo finaly win a big race.So yes. If you are at all interested in dog racing buy it now! If not you probably won't get through the stats and terminology.			"
