												FM2016 was the first time I'd skipped a year since 2008.  I felt was paying Â£35 for a database update and a generally buggier game, but over the years I was used that, but last year I was so fed up with it I stuck with FM2015. Along comes this year's update and nothing's changed, in fact very little has changed from 2015. I mean who gives a toss if there's a pre-match line-up and handshake, watch it twice, the novelty wears off, then who doesn't click through it as soon as a skip button appears. I also think the social media stuff is useless bloat, it's click candy and not very good click candy.On to the match engine which is better in some ways and worse in others with the much hyped new video captures i.e. tackles: they motion captured a tailor's dummy while the tackler does a little tapdance and the ball shoots away, and he'll run after it, or just stand there and watch while an opposition player runs from twice as far away to retain possession. (although sliding tackles are fine now)  Shooting at the near post almost every time hasn't been fixed, nor has trying to pass the ball through the clump of opposition players directly in front of you, when you have players free all around you, nor has the disconnect between the action and the text description, if you say the forward blazes over the bar don't show the goalie pushes it over, unless it's followed by players arguing for a corner.  Also ""that would've been some goal"" is only right about 1 time in 20. There are lots of others that haven't been fixed.Negotiations with agents is way worse than 2015. You can get redlocked out for something as innocuous as changing the wage rise from 10 to 15 games. I've started saving my games before negotiations because of stupidities like that. And injuries are way over done. In the Man City game i'm playing I've assembled the best medical team money can buy and I've got De Bruyne, Sterling, Aguerro, Sane, Stones, and Otamendi all out long term. Well I own it now. They definitely did something to the demo that made freak scores more likely in the full version. Oh and sort out the damned licensing issues and stop being cheapskates because we can mod the team names et al ourselves.Also can't understand why you can't have the demo ready in July, and the full version synched to the start of the season, with a full update when the transfer window closes.Well not a positive review, but having clocked up over 8,000 hours playing various versions i'm think i'm entitled to a moan.

												If you are tempted to buy new FM2017, please read some of the reviews first, including mine.I am long-time fan of this series, started with FM 2008 and bought the new one every single year since then. Well, this year might be actually the last one for me. Every FM veteran knows that every year there are high expectations from the fans and big promises from the developers. Somehow last couple years the developers fail to deliver the game we all want, which leads to an increasing number of people turning their backs on Sports Interactive.Lets start with my statement, that I am really trying to be fair and point out only relevant things, as I am not blinded by hate. I just want to play a good football manager simulation game that is actually enjoyable.The concept of the game is awesome, potential is huge and there are countless options and different approaches. Then why so many people dont enjoy the game? Its easy to answer. They expect a REAL simulation with HIGH CONTROL, however SI fails to deliver it.Lets check out some of the issues.1) Team MoraleIn FM 2017 there is often no possibility to make players more happy beside winning a lot. You cant approach or speak to players with low morale. That is really stupid.-You are trying to boost team morale by good training, good approach to players, fulfilling your promises etc. just to find out that players who played 35 out of 38 games want to leave your team because they want to play more. -Players want new contracts 1 year after they have signed a 5year deal increasing their salary 3 times. If you reject it, it very often leads to a riot of other (happy) players, forcing you to sell that particular player and possibly some of his (now unhappy) supporters in the team as well or giving him 3times better salary again.-Your key defender was sent off last match in 12th minute after 2 yellow cards bringing your team down. You fined him. He says he didnt deserve the fine and his morale drops massively. Another red card for him the next match. You fine him again (because thats what you do everytime someone gets it=fair). He wants to leave the club.2) Transfers&ContractsAlthough I think the current system of transfers/contracts offers a lot in a good way, its still far from reality sometimes.- Very often you receive an absolute lowballs for your key players- You need money so you try to sell your good and valuable first team player that was really good past couple seasons and a lot of clubs should be interested. No offers received even if you significantly lower the price- You need to offer ridiculous amount of money for average teenagers- Your average first team 34 years old player wants to sign a new contract and he asks again for increased wage with no negotiations. You reject it. He becomes free agent and then he signs for club 2 divisions lower with 10% of his previous wage- You want your promising youngster to go on loan. He doesnt want to go play first team somewhere else and wants to stay in your lower divison B team, which is significantly worse than club that offered him a first team spot.- Most of players (their agents) want ridiculous bonuses- Some player agents are way too greedy, forcing you to stop negotiating with player that played in your club for 10 years- You are one of the greatest managers of all time and you made your club very rich and famous, yet when your contract is about to be renewed 5% wage increase is impossible3) TacticsMajority of players dont know how to use the tactics and related options properly, making them believe the matches are hard to win and it doesnt matter what formation or system you use. Well, to be honest, the tactics should be the most important and the most result-changing aspect of the game. It certainly has the effect on the match itself, but to be fair, there are way too many player/tactical errors and unlogic behaviour. - You are playing at home in a cup against very weak team from lower division. You studied their tactics, they want to play in very defensive setup, park the bus and instead of counterattacks they prefer just to send long balls to their lonely striker. So you focus on that striker, yet he still scores 3 goals a match. -The next match you play against leader of the divison at home again. Its going to be a tough match. You want to have a good ball posession, focus on strong defense and in counterattacks you rely on your wingers to break their narrow defense line. But clean sheet is a priority, you dont want to lose. And result? 5:7. No words needed. Very real, isnt it?- According to the simulation, defenders ignore their instructions, wingers ignore their instructions- Enemy scores from outside the box every now and then, but your team once a season (despite the tactics)Basically you can create tactics, make numerous plans, give instructions, study the opponent, yet still the match itself is way too random and your decisions should affect the match a lot more.3)3D simulationI swear. Nobody needs this 3D simulation. To me it is absolutely useless as long as you will serve us this mess. Players do absolutely random stuff like shooting from the corner flag or missing the empty goal 10 times in a row etc.Goalkeepers are just figurines, defenders look like they play football for the first time in their life and the graphic itself isnt any good at all either. Please focus on improving the basics of the game and after that start working on 3D.I personally never use this 3D as it makes me wanna quit the game instantly. Im pretty sure most of the people feel the same.4) Beta, bugs, reportsBeta should be here to help SI find the last bugs they havent found themselves before the alpha is released. Yet SI forum is full of topics and bug reports that nobody adressed to this date.I personally reported several bugs I have found, SI adressed just one (where in certain scenario you could play 38 matches instead of 34 in the Portuguese premier league). Rest of my bug reports (with proper evidence and savefiles) were never adressed, but some more recent were. Where is the logic?With that being said I need to mention, that as someone already wrote down here in reviews, check out how many suggestions or customer requests SI actually implemented in game. None.And should I even mention what everybody knows? That this year SI promised to deliver a chinese language to this game and by broking that promise, they basically scammed 40k chinese players who have bought this game?5) AchievementsThere are many people like me who like to go for the achievements. Achievements bring a new challenges to the game so I want to see them fixed.But every year there are some achivements impossible to obtain. Back in the days the biggest problem was to get the National Hero achivements (where you need to get the club from the lowest to the highest division). Then it was the Custom Challenge one, this year its actually a whole load of broken achievements including the most basic ones like scoring a goal in competitive match, winning continental cup or buying/selling players.Please as I stated at the beginning, Im trying to be fair here, so I wanna say again that FM series were, is and probably will be very decent game with incredible depth and awesome football content. You can have fun playing it, you can love it, but the more time you spend playing and trying new things, the more you will see how this game actually needs a massive improvement. I know the series pretty well so I am sure that devs have a lot of work ahead and hopefully one day, they will adress what should have been already adressed. So at the very end of my review, I have to say I DONT RECOMMEND this game, definitely not worth 55â¬. Maybe on sale but still, beside some cosmetic changes and small updates, the game is pretty much the same for a long time now and not worth its price by far.			"

												Hey! Here's an idea, if you don't have enough new features and content etc to reasonably justify selling as a brand new fully priced game then DON'T!!!Instead of copy pasting the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ every year and pretending it's a whole new game, why not actually make SEQUELS, proper 2 or 3 or 4 year development cycle sequels that noticably raise and develop the concept, and database updates, editor, manager Barbie mode, maybe official licenses and even face and stadium packs, anything that does not affect the players ability to manage a team, could be sold as fairly priced DLC packs to pay the bills. But you'll never get it, you're too far gone.I played this series many years ago, when it was on the Amiga and early PC versions, but the game lost it's magic for me, they forgot that less is more, it's far better to do a few things well rather than trying to do everything to varying degrees of success, from the sublime to the comically, excrutiatingly ridiculous.It's not only me, look at the reviews, sure some justifiably angry 'lied to' Chinese have skewed the figures, but only slightly, look at the top rated reviews, all negative and not a chinese character in sight.You see SI, people are getting sick of your lazy money grubbing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t.You should ditch the 3D match engine for a start, go back to basics, leave what is good, improve what can be improved and throw the rest into the trash, then slowly add new features once they are functioning correctly.Sega killed this franchise, like they did with Total War, it's dying a horrible and humiliating death, most can see it, sure it still sells and will always sell as long as it's the only show in town, but wait, mark my words, one day some football loving genius will emerge from his bedroom with the game this one should have become after 20 odd years of trying, a market conqueror that will emerge and kick this stale over-hyped garbage into touch once and for all.Football manager is nothing more than a database bolted onto a very mediocre, exremely flawed and bug infested fail game.

												I have been playing Championship manager\Football Manager for most of my lihe, damn, i have spent years of my life in every iteration of this game, since the beggining, so i can only talk for my self. Last year the Match Engine to me was terrible, whatever i tried i never had any consistency, with teams like Barcelona or Bayern, i could beat a big team by 3 or 4 , and then get crushed by the worst teams in the league, but the worst was that the gameplay we saw in the match engine made no sense, the players made really stupid things, wingers were useless, strikers were blind bats, but the opposition most of the times were laser guides in their ONE CHANCE, AND HITTING THE BAR 5 OR 6 TIOMES IN A GAME WAS USUAL, like i said, i played every version they made so i might not be a tactical god (LOL), but i know enought to at least make a team play in a certain way, well, not last year.Now i talked about last year because this year, FM 17 was a new experience, the engine was 10 times better, no more insane perfect counter from bad teams, the defenders even knew what they were doing, and the striker with 20 in finishing didn't miss 8\10 chances when 1 on 1 with the keeper...UNTIL THE 17.1.0 PATCH, after the patch everything wen't  RIGHT BACK TO FM 16 AGAIN, no defending, super fast perfect counters from any team, no more good looking football, hell, i bought Cavani and he scored 13 goals in 10 games, after the patch, 0, ZERO, GOALS IN 10 GAMES, COME ON, and when i told this in the feedback in the forum, in minutes i was ""attacked"" by a fanboy that doesnt know what FEEDBACK means, if you think something is wrong with the game, you are a target, so after so may years playing every game they made, i can only wait and see if they fix what WAS PERFECT IN 17.0.1 AND IS NOW BROKEN IN 17.1.0.Oh, and you guys want to know the ""fixes"" they made in the patch, GOOD LUCK, they say in their forum, PLAY AND SEE WHAT IS DIFFERENT, WOW, we don't even have the right to know what they changed, thats perfect client care, they own the market and they simply can do whatever they want because idiots like me keep on buying even though we get no respect.

												Over the years I've invested more time in this franchise than all the other games I've played combined, so it pains me to kick them while they're down, it really does, but enough is enough.It's basically a patched version of 2016 with a smattering of new features, although I'm not sure they really qualify as features. It seems that each year they're so desperate to justify the price tag that they just shoe horn in ever more inane featurettes while completely neglecting issues that have plagued the series for years.The AI is still appalling.The match engine although improved still falls way short.The social media thing is a complete waste of space.The manager 'designer' is very lame, the models suck quite frankly, the clothing, the hands, it's been very poorly done, not sure why they bothered with it as it adds nothing at all to the gameplay, just more low grade padding.Paying full price for a database update is beginning to really grate with me, played the series since its inception and have bought every iteration, but I really think this will be the last time I get stung.Yes it's the best footie management game out there, but honestly it seems to be stuck in a rut, they pretty much add nothing of substance and don't seem able to fix what is wrong. I'll play it but cannot in good conscience recommend it, at least not for the full asking price. They'll need to really up their game in order to tempt me back to the franchise, and judging by the last few releases that's just not going to happen.4/10 "

												Almost didn't buy the game because of the negative reviews, most complaning about how there has been no changes to the game play. This turns out to be not the case at all. I'll go through a short pros/cons that can be helpful.Pros:- Match engine is much improved compared to 2016. Full backs are much more in line with how they should perform, and attacks/passing show much more variance. In 2016 it was always the same ""through pass to full back, cross, goal"" formula, now you can actually see some variety in attacks. On top of that, defending seems more balanced with players avoiding getting caught off position and actually behaving like regular defenders instead of marauding savages who always charge to the ball.- Scouting in general seems a lot better.- Match reporting is a huge upgrade. I can't understand how people are neglecting this so easily. Pre and post match reports are way more detailed now, with heatmaps too!- Some people reported that their team plays the same regardless the tactic. This is not the case at all. I have a control based 4-3-2-1 and a counter attacking 4-4-1-1. My team is very responsive to the tactic switches, and perform/play significantly different when switched to the other tactic.- Social feed is a nice touch, even though it seems to be not fully developed.Cons:- There are a lot of groundbreaking updates that SI seems to be ignoring every year. They need to go through some of those and actually implement a few.- Same texts for press conferences, player interactions. These are getting old real fast. Need to have new options/interactions here. Would be better to interact with players regarding tactics etc.- Injuries... still devastating. - AI isn't the brightest. During my Champions League 3rd Qual Round match, Monaco didn't even bother to close down my players when we were holding a narrow 1 goal lead at the end of the game, while my players casually wasted time in the middle of the pitch.Overall: With yearly releases this is pretty much what you gonna get. Is it a massive upgrade compared to 2016? No.Is it better than 2016? Yes.Am I enjoying it? Yes.Would I recommend it? Yes. "

												Another life-long fan of the series, but this incarnation seems really awful.  1) Wins the league with Arsenal for the first time in many years.  Reaches Champion's League final.  Ozil immediately demands transfer.2) Easily wins league, reaches Champion's League final for 2nd year in a row.  Bellerin and Icardi (both of whom list Arsenal as their favourite club) demand to leave.  Impossible to keep either of them.  When I try to keep Bellerin entire squad demands that I let him go.3) 4th season Griezman, Renato Sanchez and Mustafi all demand transfers to bigger clubs.  Currently we are first in the league, and on course for a Champion's League final.  Note: It infuriates the players when I suggest that a bigger contract might make them want to stay.  Where is the logic?Also, after a five game losing streak we turn it around and are winning 2-1 away from home.  A number of players on the team are complacent.  wtf?I like the challenge, we all do.  What we like even more is logic.  This is the least realistic version of CM/FM ever.			"

												Social Media Simulation.More interviews. More E-Mails. More Twitter.The main new features (Social Feed, and FaceGEN) are half-cooked. Social feed is attrocious. What the hell were they thinking? You get a positive, a neutral and a negative 'tweet' for everything you do. It doesn't get boring. It's boring from the get go.FaceGEN, while a cool idea, is executed awfully. You'll see your manager pic everywhere. There's no escaping it, unless you disable the feature from the get go. Even then, you still have to choose some horrific images. Not only this, but the regen images are awful. Seriously awful. Most of my youth products are bald or have demonic eyes.The general game idea is the same. The first few years are cool. Then the imbalanced regens appear and the AI appear to be clueless on how to build a team. I respect this is difficult, but they need to spend more time on AI and the actual tactical aspect on the game rather messing around with gimmicky features (In-game twitter).The lack of updates is annoying too. Unable to drag and drop players bug is a killer. Uninstalled. Playing FM2016. No regrets. "

												I have been playing either CM or FM for over 20 years.  This is the first review of a product or game I have ever written.This is the first time the game has beat me.  I literally have no idea what I am doing wrong or how to fix the slumps my team's encounter. I can go from being on a 12 game unbeaten run, to a 12 game losing streak. I appreciate I must be doing something wrong, but the game is horrendous at offering any sort of constructive feedback.  Generic Assistant Manager suggestions such as 'I suggest we adopt a shorter passing game' or words to that effect, are useless and often counter productive. I have spent hours in forums reading up on tactics, listening to podcasts, all to no avail.  Over the last 20 years this game has provided me with a fantastic way of wasting my time.  It has increasingly however become a greater and greater source of frustration.  It is a shame, but with great regret this will be the last edition I buy or play.  I'm done. Never thought I would say that. "

												Will this be my last one?Football manager 2017 review, (this review is based of the base price of the game and improvability, sry for my bad english in advance ï)I have bought all the FM titles since FM 2007 and i have a fair bit of experience playing this game. I have spent hours after hours trying to work out the best possible strategies etc and it has been very interesting and a fun journey through all these years. FM has always been a very addicting and difficult game to master and still is to this day. There is no better feeling than winning the premiership or any sort of cups you have been trying win for years but have never managed to take the final step up. But why will this be my last title?PositivesThe most important factor in this game, improvability. In this years title there has been quite a few new improvements. Social timeline (social media tab) â a very nice improvement to the game, this adds alot of immersion towards playing the game and it feels better getting that needed win against your main rival or you sign a new player, and seeing the sosial medias reaction to it. But after a few games this might seem a bit repetitive and you will soon start seeing the same posts popping up again. This is definently a nice step forward and needs a bit of improvement. Crispier graphics â They have improved the graphics a bit during matches and the players are more clear and just looks better. (the way they, shoot, pass, drible etc) Big signings â I have noticed that teams like city, utd, Real, etc signs big players for stupid high values, which is just like in real life and again, that makes the game alot more challenging and immersive. Taking a picture for yourselves the manager â thats a very nice addon for players that want to have an option to do so.  These are some of the main features in this game i have noticed so far after playing about a 100 hours. Ofc there are alot more improvements to the game but they are significantly smaller than these once i have listed and it would take ages to write this review if i were to add them. NegativesLets start of with something i have always wanted them to do something about, but they never have.Press conferences â press conferences is huge part of real life football. But why do i still see the exact same questions since fm 12, this is a joke and needs to be improved. Most people just send their assitants including me because of the lack of variaty in the press conferences.Match engine â No improvements towards the match engine so far, and has been the same since fm 14 and 15. Same sort of goals beeing scored most of the time. An example can be crosses, why is it that your team just cannot defend crosses, why is crosses beeing scored this often, in pretty much every single match i play, there is always a cross goal. Completely no marking, even though your team instructions is put on structured and tight marking. This leads to another flaw in the match engine. Which is team instructions, try and put your instructions to play out of defence, and take a look at how many times your goalkeeper is going to kick the ball up completely ignoring your instruction (this is just an example) Or all the times your team, shoots it from outside the box when they are told to work the ball in to the box. This is the biggest flaw with the game in my opinion so far and they never seem to fix this. Player moral â this has been in the game since the early fm days. And it is completely broken, you could be winning the premiership with maybe 10 points and have full control. And then you unluckily loose at home to a premiership mid team which is normal. And you would be thinking we could bounce back even stronger in the next game despite the teams horrible performance in the previous game. But thats not the case, the moral is going to decrease significantly, making the players completey useless despite their huge lead in the league, and this will often result in a bad run. A bad run can last for a couple of games, and that just makes the moral worse until you can fianlly talk to your team saying we need to step up, boosting the moral again. And you can only do this when you are below your expactation in the league, so lets just say, you have a huge lead in the league, but towards the end you start loosing alot of games and teams behind start to catch up, having a team meeting will cause the moral to go down, despite their terrible form because of their league position. Unhappiness â,Another thing is that you can not talk to your own players when they are unhappy, that is the biggest load of bull and there is need for a much better system around that.  Players get unhappy for stupid reasons, mostly first team football, even if you have a player who has played most of your games he will still complain. And then he goes to complain to his teammates which brakes the moral even moreâ¦ I will continue to update this review as time goes on, these are just some of the few things ive experienced so far with this game. For a experinced player who is looking to buy the new game i canât recommend it in this state, just keep your old one and be happy about it. For a newer player however, it might be worth a shot, since its basically the same as all the previous fms. (If you put fm 2012 up aginst fm 2017 theres not a big differnce at all, which is shocking btw)This will most likely be my last fm title if they dont sort things out soon. (Mind boggeling that they charge full price for this game) If anyone disagrees on something i would love to hear it :)(extra note, regens is broken, all regens which spawns turns in to physical beasts, which litteraly can win a boxing tournament...)

												This game is a huge disappointment. Apart from the fact that absolutelly nothing important changed since last year, things that used to bother me in FM 2016 became even worse. Let me give you a few examples: (NOTE: Of course, the examples i am going to provide do not apply in absolutelly every game, but i can safely guarantee it happens in most of them)1. Goalkeepers - A few unbelievable mistakes goalkeepers used to make in FM 2016 are nothing compared to those they make now, GKs are unable to defend even the simplest shots, those going straight into them are reflected into their own net more often than not.2. Late goals - No matter what you do, you won't be able to defend in 99% of occasions. Your best bet is to try and score as many goals as you can before 75th minute, because your team will just stop playing afterwards.3. Defense - Positioning in both defence (mostly your center backs) and attack (your full backs) is terrible. No matter how specific your instructions are, it won't matter. More often than not, i notice my full backs instructed to cross from deep and always stay wider lurking on the edge of opposition area as if they were inverted wing backs. Needless to say, my Inside Forwards that are supposed to sit narrower often go wider than Wingers in those occasions, making the time i used to carefully design my tactics be all in vain. 4. Tactics - I already gave an example above, but there's a lot more to it. First thing i want to mention is the defensive line. If you keep it higher, through balls will always find their way behind your defense and there will always be a dangerous opposition attacker with HUGE anticipation, off the ball and acceleration that DOESN't go above 10 that will overrun your entire 15+ acceleration defenders (yes, even that one that is on a cover duty), go one on one against your best-in-the-league goalkeeper and use his composure that is barely there and his finishing that makes you believe he is a defense player to score without a single problem. If he's in a good mood, he will probably entertain the fans and round the keeper because why not. If you keep defensive line lower, no problem - They would just start shooting from impossible distances and those balls would just end up as the most beautiful goals ever scored or they would hit your defender on the way and end up as own goals. If nothing happens, there's always your goalkeeper to finish the job by being hit in the back after a rebound from the crossbar or simply push the ball inside. Second problem is, long story short, whatever you do, whichever mentality you choose, final outcome won't change. Say, you lead 2 - 0, last 20 minutes of the game - If you choose to defend, keep the ball, play careful as much as you can in order to limit the number of attacks they can make or you decide to keep playing attacking football like you did so far because you believe attack is the best defence as they can't attack you if you attack them, it doesn't really matter. In first case, it's as if the game is instructed to teach you a lesson because you retreated too much so early in the game, while in second case it's like: ""Oh well, you kept attacking, left too much space for their counter attacks, and you paid for it."" Also, there's a third option: In case you manage to balance the first two options and you don't allow them to attack almost at all, there's always a chance one of your players would get a red card, make a penalty out of nowhere or you will concede from a set pieces because there's some opposition player just standing there in the middle of your box without being guarded by any of your players. There are probably a few things i forgot to mention, but all this is enough to make me start hating this game. During previous years version, i went easy on all these things that used to bug me because i understand this is a game and those matches are scripted, there has to be ups and downs during your season, it's not easy to make it realistic and balance everything. However, now i simply believe this game is designed to â¥â¥â¥â¥ you off and make you play it simply because you are annoyed at how powerless you are, not because you enjoy playing it. Hell, i even caught myself laughing after some games cus of how unrealistic they were.The only improvement i see this year is that you can actually buy some players for a reasonable amount, unlike last year where you had to spend a fortune to get a proper backup player.

												Pretty much an FM16 re-skin, no changes to tactics etc.I've played 700 odd hours but I play that every single year on FM without fail, however if I'd have known this was just gonna be FM16 with Brexit added I'd sink 700 more into FM16.Good game if you've never played FM16			"

												Is it better than 2016? Not at all and I didn't recommend 2016. In fact, I can import my old tactics and graphics. This literally means they changed next to nothing in regards to tactics and graphics. Nothing added in this yearâs version justifies this as a new version, it is nothing more than a few small changes, a couple new screens and a database update. I have a 7 yearsâ study of the request threads they post on the SI forums and complied a list of the top 20 most requested things people wish to see. Guess how many of the top 5 requests they have accomplished in the past 7 years? Zero. This literally means they are not listening to the customers at all anymore. Manager avatars/on the touch line was not even in the top 100.Just to put it out there since I know people will ask me, the #1 most requested thing in FM is a new and overhauled transfer system.Am I going to play this game a lot? Yeah, because like I said every year before this one, there is no alternative but it does not mean I will recommend this to anyone nor does it mean I cannot expect more of an update to the game than purely cosmetic rubbish.

												23 years. Started off with the 3.5' disk on CM and saw its demise until i migrated over to FM. It was great coupled with endless hours of addiction and joy. Data has always been the team strength as the guys in FM were mostly from CM in the past. Great user interface with year on year minor tweaks; typical of this company. From a teenager to a family man, Championship Manager and FM has always been a part of my life. But this 2017 edition tops the trash bin. Its a rubbish. Given the resources and the expertise developed over the years, the match engine is no better than an amateur who started off programming. UI is not optimised and worse of all, it is no better than FM 2016. Bottom line is, i thought i loaded a wrong game as it has 90% similarity to FM 2016! I honestly do not know how one can manage to give a good review unless they are paid for to rave things up. Overall, except for the updates to the player and club database, i will give it a miss. Match engine, i suggest you go for commentary as it only serves to make your blood boil. Damage, go buy other games. Verdict: Drop it.			"

												Simply not good enough. Ice skating players on the match engine and terrible goalkeepers kill all immersion, and the gameplay is a weird mix of over the top simulation about every aspect of football imaginable, combined with the players on the pitch utterly ignoring everything you do.This is akin to using a spreadsheet that doesn't work - throroughly unenjoyable. Football Manager lost the magic a long time ago, and this edition doesn't bring it back. It needs a complete rework from the ground up at this point.			"

												As a long time fan of the series and SI, having played their CM games and all of the FM titles, I have to be honest and share a summary review that truly represents a feeling of disapointment I have as well as most of the long time fans.FM is obviously the best football simulationg game, it has incredibly features overall. But speaking about FM17... You might as well keep playing FM16. I bought and I honestly feel that if things next year don't improve A LOT this was the last one. A lot of things can be said about the game but I'll just focus some major aspects:1) The match engine hasn't improved at all. AI is still glitchy, I cannot understand how 1 year after we still get the same poor experience in terms of realism. ""Added motion control movements to players""... this ins't FIFA, the goal should be achieving greater match realism/experience. Movement of players is clunky and it's almost as if your tactical decisions mean nothing... Your opponent can have a lone striker and paly defensively, you focus on that player, mark him, close him down, build a powerful scheme... And yet he scores a hat-trick! Say again?You can play and dominate a game agains your opponent with 70% ball possession, 30 shots on goal, etc... and yet you're opponent who only shoots 3 times, scores all those times and you lose the match 1-3?You can have games between two top league tables that end with results such as 7-6.... 5-0... Absolutely ridiculous. And these are just a couple of examples.2) The social feed... This new feature adds zero to the game. What was the purpose of spending time doing this? You always get a couple positive and a couple negative comments. It will not affect your decision making at all... Just useless.3) SI should've improved the realism in contract/transfer negotiations by now... This has been addressed by fans for a long time. Agents demand unrealistic bonuses that can largely surpass the bonus for the player itself and be similar to the value of the transfer. Also they get impatient and unless you give them what you want the deal burns and you can't speak to them again. This isn't ""Football Agent Manager 17""... It's absurd the amount of failed negotiations because of their unrealistic demands.Another ongoing issue... You can try and sell your top players but you'll never get a huge offer, involving loads of millions for them, even if it's fair. On the other hand if you want to buy one such player you always have to burn trough all your fortune... It's realistic that a team demands a huge amount from you for a star player. It just isn't that you can't get those same teams to do the same for YOUR star player...4) Player moral is still uncontrollable and glitchy... If you manage and you do it right your team will have a superb moral, but nowadays it just seems that the moral depends solely on winning matches or giving a lot of playing time to some player. This is a simulator and it should be about providing optimal training conditions, decent contracts, superb team management, among all the other conditions you need to keep a smooth level of moral amongst the squad. How long before the improvement of the Team talks (should be able to do with anytime with pertinent dialogue)? Why is it that if you fine or warn a player because he's been ejected with a red card 3, 4, 5 times in 9 or 10 matches he thinks it's unfair, causes havoc in the dressing room and demands to leave? For the love of god... get it straight guys, that's not how it goes in real life...I could go on forever. The essential is that not only didn't the game improve from last year's... But also it seems the most absurd and irritating issues persist year after year. SI has an incredible team and a great working force. I know they are more than capable of doing better. This is a game that relies heavily on loyalty players and I honestly thinks their major concerns are being ignored...Still the best football managing game. But, for now, stick with the '16 version.

												Same old game with a slightly different skin.Here are some positives and negatives in no particular order.Positives:Some quality of life improvements.Better presentation.Scanning your face in to the game is fun.Slightly better graphics and some new camera angles.The game seems harder this year, but that could be the game cheating you... who knows? It's very hard to tell what you are doing wrong when it's not going your way.Players (match engine) finally learned to pass rather than shoot on tight angles... sometimes.Negatives:Incredibly slow menus compared to last years version.Saving the game nearly takes 30 seconds.The match engine is pretty poor:Insane amount of deflected goals.In fact, the amount of deflections happening inside the box in general is insane.Great goalkeepers not saving shots straight at them. Marking on set pieces is buggy, with defenders swapping position with strikers after the corner/free kick is taken.Marking in general seems buggy, with defenders sometimes just ignoring the striker until he has the ball.Six players on the same team (including the keeper) attacking the same ball on a long throw in.Strikers are mostly ball watching when you don't have the ball, allowing the opposing defenders to easily close down clearences and recycle possesion.Doesn't seem to be much difference between a 2 and a half star sttriker and a 4 star striker, if he is on your team.Same goes for goalkeepers.Midfielders and defensive midfielders rarely get good ratings (unless they score or assist), so it's impossible to tell if they are doing a good job. You have to dive deep and analyse each match to find that out.The referee blows the final whistle when you are in attacking positions.They rarely patch the game, despite there being pretty obvious issues. Instead they wait months before releasing a patch.Watching scouting highlights seems pretty pointless.Social media feed was funny at the start, but becomes as tiresome as press conferences and interviews.Same old questions and answers when being interviewed. Do relationships with other managers matter?There is always one or two players complaining about training, and your assistant manager doesn't care (that is if you have the â¥â¥â¥. man taking care of individual training).I've been in the Premiere League with York City for 6-7 season with 12.000 capacity stadium with no options to expand or build a new stadium.The regen faces this year are hideous.More often than not, the odds seem stacked against you.Conclusion:I still like the game, but I wouldn't really recommend it. The last three versions of FM have been pretty similar if you ask me. I got my moneys worth out of all of them, but also a lot of frustration.This years version might be the worst of them, or it could be that I just started noticing all the faults in the game this time...Although I don't recommend this version, I will still play it and I will most likely pick up the next version. Let's hope it's better.			"

												At Â£34.99 it is way over priced. The game is exactly the same as last year except of a few graphical updates, fixes and switching the layout around. It is still the best football manager game but its not changed much in the last 3 years (in my opinion). Even Fifa has new features. I would only get this FM if someone is buying it for you as present, i would'nt bother wasting your money when it is no different to FM 16.			"

												TL:DR: This game gets worse every year, do not bother buying if you are an experienced player.I have been playing every version of this game since 2008, with a decreasing level of enjoyment every year. This game contains most of the bugs from 2016 and older versions, while adding new, even worse bugs.I pre-ordered this game and got to try it in its beta-state. As one could expect from a game in beta it had a lot of issues, with most of the ""bugs"" being gone once the full game dropped. One of the most glaring issues I noticed during the beta was that my defenders simply would not mark the players I assigned them to mark. This was a frustrating issue in 2016 already but this time it was on a whole new level. My players would initially stand on the wrong side of the player they were supposed to mark, meaning the (un)marked player could simply run towards my goal, get a pass and score. Not only this, but once the (un)marked player actually got the ball and ran towards my goal, my defender would jog (F*CKING JOG) like 3 meters behind him without even trying to catch him.""No problem"", I thought. ""This will get fixed once the finished version drops"". I went on the Sports Interactive forums and voiced my concerns with this ""bug"", only to be told by Sports Interactive employees that this issue was due to my players having low attributes on ""concentration"" and ""marking"" and what have you. I was pretty shocked, as I have never in my entire life seen a defender defend so poorly in a real game of football. Are the developers actually this clueless or will this be fixed when the game drops?Fast forward to today, a few weeks after release. The ""bug"", which isn't even a bug by their logic, is still present in the game.I could go on and on about other issues with this game, but most of them have likely been covered by others, and the issue that I mentioned is the one that breaks the game for me. As I stated in the beginning, I have played every version of this game since 2008, and I have watched it continually get worse. It is such a shame that a game that is so good outside of the match engine, has such a poor match engine. I told myself before playing the 2017 version that if this version is not better than 2016 it will be the last Football Manager game I purchase, and it increasingly looks like that will indeed be the case.

												My review is not for the new players. I wrote this for the people who played FM for years.I have been playing FM since the FM 2008. I really like the concept and i played 2016 almost for 500 hours. But today is the day that i understood, i had enough of this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Seriously, every year they add very little changes to the game and i bought them and played them with joy. But this year, my patience ran out. There are several reasons for why i will quit the fm games from now on. But i don't have much time right now. So i will tell you about only the biggest one : THE STUPIDITY OF THE AI... I might edit my review in the future and tell about the other ones as well but i am not sure if i will.I will not be writing about the ai's stupidity out of the pitch. Because like i said i don't have much time right now, and the stupidity out of the pitch is not really a reason to quit this beatiful concept. But on the other hand, the ai's idiocy in the pitch is annoying. For an example, your team uses a corner, and almost all of your players are inside the penalty area, trying to get the ball in. But you left one or two players in the centre circle to avoid any counter attacks. Your player used the corner, and the opposite team sent away the ball, towards the centre circle. And the ball is coming towards your players which were left to stop a counter attack. And if your players just walk towards the ball, they will have it easily. But they don't! They just wait for an opposite to get the ball. And then they start to press him! What a wonderful move! This is just a beatiful example of the cleverness of the ai... That was just one example. But there are lots of them. And the main problem is, this kind of errors were in the game for years... They didn't fix them with a patch. They didn't improve them in the next year's games... I love football manager... I really love picking my favourite team and creating my own squad. Playin against big fellas like Mourinho and Pep... But i will quit this. Because i really don't think that they will ever improve their game. We play the same game for years now. They don't add anything important, and the vital point is they don't even fix their problems...			"

TL;DR - Its better than FM16, not groundbreaking, but its good. 8/10*This is a BETA review, I will continue to update this review as I get further into the game. -Football Manager 2017. Well where do I start? Honestly I was a little apprehensive when even considering purchasing it, simply because I've been disappointed by the lack of innovation or progression by the past versions, namely 2014 and 2015. Soo did this version manage to finally meet expectations? Yes.Okay, aside from the standard database updates, there are quite a few things to note about the new series.Overlay:I for one can say that this new overlay of FM17, definitely looks significantly crisper and cleaner than its predecessors. The simple white background looks significantly better than the cluttered and messy overlay used in the previous generations. Definitely a plus point. Also glad they kept the layout of the buttons, though it took time to get used to in the past, it is definitely more streamlined and organised than those of the 2011 and 2012 versions.Match Engine:Okay I know the video that SI posted up looked as though there was absolutely no difference whatsoever in the 3D engine, however rest assured, it is definitely far from it. The movement does look smoother, and yes I do agree the AI is definitely smarter as well (though wish they could be even smarter, sometimes stupid things still happen). Couple of new moves and celebrations have been added, but nothing overall groundbreaking. Just a nicer feel to the overall gameplay experience. Manager Creator (Designing):Well this one is a nice touch, but it lacks features, significantly. It's a nice idea, but that's about it. Simple a nice idea. That hasn't been executed that well. Lack of options to customise the character is disappointing. Seems to have no choice in some cases. Personally I think this is a totally pointless feature. But maybe it's still beta soo for all I know maybe there will be more options on full release. Press Conference:Same old story. Nothing much to say here. Just some new questions and more ways to answer. Nothing much. (Still gonna skip most press conference unless its a big match). BREXIT:Well well who would have thought SI would include this in the game? BIG BIG PLUS POINT. Absolutely love it, it makes things more realistic. Though it runs on the presumption of the regulations that may be put in place its a nice idea. I like it. But it be nice to have an option to disable it for those that don't want it. Nice touch, I like! Transfer System:I like the new input of the way in which the agent can speak with you in terms of promises to the player that will be transfered. This gives you greater freedom to see what the player himself wants from joining your club. Also gives you a good idea if you will be able to accomodate him hence further impact on your decision to purchase him. Thumbs up!Staff:Okay, soo many of us heard SI banging on about the introduction of ""Sport Scientist"" etc as staff members, now personally i've left the recruitment side of it to my board members. Hence nothing much to comment about there, though I have signed MANY sport scientists apparently. Anyways, what delights me more is the scouting regime that is in placed. My scouts pick up significantly more players than ever before, finding many and giving much more indepth analysis. Training:Well here's the touchy subject. Many people often complain that their team has too many injuries and claim it is the game's problem. Well infact, it's not. If you explored deeper into the game mechanics, you will realise that the way inwhich you do your training (team) affects their overall fitness. Next up the individual trainining regimes you put players on, also affect it as well! If you overwork your player, there is a significantly higher chance of them getting injured! Training is actually quite fun to set up, soo on my part I recommend actually attempting to control the training and not leave it all to your 'Assistant Manager'.Overall Summary: Tbc			"

What the HELL do SI spend 11 months of the year doing? because you cant kid me into thinking this took that long to develop. Its a 2016 patch AT BEST!!! it's almost criminal TBF. The new features are terrible and clutterd. The whole thing in the last two years has gone backwards. The problem is they have no compeition and have a mononoply over sporting rights.

												I have played FM since the very first CM game in the 90's.  Always thought they were great games and have never had a bad word to say until now.I have give the last few versions a miss as they were basically transfer updates in my opinion.  However, I thought I would buy this one as an upgrade and check it out.  I wish I had not bothered.  The tactics don't seem to translate to what happens on the pitch.  Goalkeepers might as well be ghosts.  Your defenders will pass to the other team's forwards, whilst the other teams defenders will be rock solid.  So inconsistent - I played a game as Liverpool against Man UTD and beat them 3-1, then played Spurs and got beat 9-0 in the next game!!! Same tactics, similar team.  They scored 5 in a 3 minute spell.  I am all for not winning every game (would be too easy otherwise), but that was just unrealistic.  Stick to the older versions this one is a waste of money.			"

												First, let's just say that I was hoping to see some improvement in this game series since the last time I bought one in 2011. I was surprised - not really at the improvement part, but instead at how extremely well the artificial idiotism works. Yes, that's right. I said idiotism, not intelligence.Here are few of the problems I have spotted so far:- Goalkeepers. They have two main actions; either skate crazily and catch the ball firmly, or try a miracle save when an easy low ball comes straight at him. Very clever to try that miracle jump into the top right corner, when the ball is actually going low into the middle of the goal. Absolutely stupid actions there.- Defensive playing. There is no proper pressing or tackling, no matter what the tactical setup is. Defensive players approach the attacking player like they were absolutely terrified of the ball, cowering in fear two meters away and letting the opposing player pass the ball away freely and safely. If a random tackle ever happens, it's usually two-footed and results in a direct red card.- Headers in midfield. If your goalkeeper or defenders open up with a high ball into anywhere within the mid-half of the pitch, your players never even try to win those balls. They apparently have absolutely no jumping strength at all, while the opposition players look like kangaroos out there. To be absolutely honest though, most of the time your midfielders run 5 meters off the ball's actual landing spot and as such never even need to show that lack of jumping strenght. They just like to watch the opponent picking up a free ball, from a safe distance of course.- Strikers and headers. Even a target man who should be regularly winning headers and trying to either hold the ball or flick it to the other striker or attacking midfielder never seems to even try. In the team I played with, I had a very strong target type striker, who should be stronger with head than foot. And what does he do with high passes? Stand still, usually in the right place though, but firmly rooted to ground, while the opposing team's tiniest-midfielder-ever jumps way over him and heads the ball into safety every time.- Receiving passes. Why on earth does the receiving player have to stand absolutely still until the pass comes all the way to him? Let's say that Player A passes the ball to Player B. Player C is the opposition defender. When Player A sends the pass, Player C immediately sees the chance to intercept and starts moving. However, Player B does not react at all; he stands still, waiting for the ball, until Player C has successfully intercepted the pass and is already starting the counter attack with his whole team, while your team doesn't even understand that there's any danger at all. If Player C can see the possibility to intercept, why doesn't Player B see that and try to get to the ball as well instead of just ""giving it away""?- Picking up loose balls, such as rebounds. Midfielder runs to the ball, takes control of it, and... well, simply stands with it long enough for an opposition player to freely take it away. Generally, there's a huge amount of just standing and letting the other team take a freebie, and within highlights, it's always the AI controlled team who gets these freebies....such as a midfielder getting a pass just outside of the penalty box, standing like there he's grown roots, back towards the goal, with two opposing players curiously staring at him and wondering why he has suddenly started to meditate instead of trying to pass the ball anywhere. Finally, opposing players just take the ball and pass it safely away from the area. If this happens for example near the sidelines, your midfielder will stand still for a long time even after the ball has been taken away, and then sprint into chase. Into a hopeless chase, as the opposing player is already 30 meters ahead.- Another version with loose balls: Your player is 10 meters from the ball, running towards it. Opposing player is 15 meter from the ball, also running towards it. Which one wins? Yes, it's always the opposing player who wins and takes a freebie, as your player is afraid of any close proximity of others and slows down well in advance to avoid it.Seriously? This is the level of AI that has been considered good enough for release?In short: Match engine in general is a f'ing disaster. It makes absolutely no sense. Any FM or CM series game before 2010 was much better, so do not waste your money on this piece of crap.Edit: Fixed a few typos.			"

												SEGA said they are working on to add Chinese support so I may change this review later based on the progress.As a player originally from China, I just want to give everyone not from China a simple explanation why this year so many Chinese buyers just give FM negative reviews because of lack of Chinese version.The several top reviews somehow are right, SI never includes the Chinese in the game and the store page never said there will be a Chinese version. But this already last for about 10 years. Chinese buyers never do anything like this year.Why? Because Chinese customer not only wants to give the negative review for the lack of Chinese version but also the attitude the SI showing. So in 2011 some people asking if there will be a Chinese version from SI, Mile Jacobson replied that they need 20k copy sold in China ( https://twitter.com/milesSI/status/128969002398646274 ) (P.S.: before this link found, he even deny he said that... Come on ). In 2016, from steamspy, there are 40000 copys sold in China( 5th in the world). So some one aksing SI again, then Mile Jacobson just repled like this ( https://twitter.com/milesSI/status/791659905933533184 ). Read his reply, do you think SI really care about customers???? Of course people from other countries may not need to struggle with this as they already have official language support. But what if you have other opinions for the game? Do you think the developer will listen to you? And for many Chinese customers using 200 RMB to buy a game is not a small cost, but they were encouraged by the 20k promise so there are a lot of people just got the games. But right now SI just made them extremely disappointed.			"

												Easily the clunkiest, buggiest, biggest JOKE of a manager game that this company has ever produced.Quite how it has gradually got worse year on year is beyond me. Boy oh boy do we need a knight in shining armor to come and create a rival manager game because SI are complacant as â¥â¥â¥â¥ year after year, churning out this tripe knowing that it will sell regardless.Well at least this year it's fans have had enough, at least according to the reviews. Here's hoping SI take note and hang their heads in shame.			"

												I first played Championship Manager when I was 8 years old.Im much older now and still enjoy the game.The Last Copy I bought was in 2013.There must be a Final FM Platform made.Enough selling me $60 game every 10 months.Instead of loosing a $60 customer for 7 years,...earn a yearly $10 customer...and sell me an Update to my Finalized Platform.Enough is Enough. I love this game, still do.Yet I am not going to be taken advantage of. Evolve, or continue to lose loyal fans and customers.			"

												Worst of the series.There were always stupid things on game like too often idiotic decisions too much incredible goal miss what so ever.But this one is worst.For example best penalty taker of Euro 16 Bogdan Stancu misses 4 of 5 penalties in game.Injuries every match of course.One of my players got 3 back to back red cards for being Jackie Chan on the pitch.I dont reccomend ir to anyone but i will keep playin it.I will always gonna play it because i love the game.Sadly they are makin it worse every year			"

												Football manager is a solid game but i like many others feel conned at forking out full price every year for what essentially feels nothing more than a patch. Tee 3D engine has a slight improvement on last years but still looks like a fifa game from 15 years ago. The twitter feed has a short lived novelty value but adds nothing to the playing experience and you simply stop looking at it after a few games. The match interviews don't feel much different. The only good new feature is the pre-negotiations in contracts but its no where near enough to justify paying the full price for. If you are reading this then i assume you have not bought it yet so i will sum it up for you here. Football manager 2016 + Â£35 in your pocket is way better than football manager 2017. Its not a bad game, its just the same game and horrendously overpriced for what you are getting.			"

												Die Hard fan of Football Manager, since the days when it was called Championship Manager (played since Championship manager 2001-2002)You really â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up SI with this year's Football Manager. All this money pumped by the community and you can't even ship proper names for the teams. Brazil, Spain are â¥â¥â¥â¥ed. Thank God the community saved our game. You asking for 55 euro for this game is a robbery. You should go to jail.			"

												Well 55 hours in and i would say that FM 17 is no different from FM 16.. Matchs look slightly better, plays 10% better than 16 but not enough of a reason to buy.Too few new features. Same questions and answers which get boring quickly.Played FM for years, last year I had spent over 2200 hours on FM 16..Ãever wrote a review until now.. Disappointed to say the least.Save yourself few pounds and stay with FM16 for a while..  "

												For a game that only does small tweaks each year, the price is ridiculous. How much is FM17 better than FM12? I have no idea. The ME essentially stayed the same, and 3D has been a joke all the way, even for the price of FM12 (25 USD I think), and I still don't know which tactic system is actually better. All the new features and improvements are not about the football part of the game. Don't tell me about the so-called ME and AI improvement. It basically means AI will stop doing some stupid things while picking up some other stupid things to do. Sadly SI just keeps harvesting money out of our addiction LOL.			"

												The problem with steam reviews is that there is no middle ground, either things are a positive or a negative. While I want to  give this game a positive review, I know my feelings for it are more neutral so I have to give it a negative review instead. The reason I have this urge is because I love the football manager series, sinking in 1000+ hours each year to Sports Interactive's football management game. I love the series like no other and each year I've seen improvements to all aspects of the game, but not so much in FM2017. There is a lot of positive things to say about the game. The graphics have improved on last year, there is a lot more varied animations, there's a lot of new ways to interact with players off the pitch, there's the addition of a social media feed which can be entertaining if you give them a read, and the most positive part, is that it's still the same old football manager game I know and love. However, none of that matters. You wll have players requesting transfers for not qualifying for the champions league if you miss out on it in the league but win the europa league. The players who leave will wonder why you've not let them go for half of their value. You will struggle to sell many of your players, and when you try and bid for opposing team players don't even try to negotiate because anything less than 100m is an insult. While many teams in real life think agents rip them off wait until they see the agent fees in football manager! And if you don't pay the agent fees, say goodbye to negotiating with that player until the next window. If the player wanted the move but negotiations collapsed because of the agents the player won't sack their agent, they will instead carry on with the same agent with low morale because of the collapsed move. The engine is still full of problems, and while i don't see losing 3-1 when your opponent has 3 shots and you have 30+ a problem like other people (that's football sometimes) I think that there are a lot of improvements to be made. Keepers make more mistakes than they should, the players don't react realistically and rarely do you ever see players making clever runs. There's never much of a need to adapt, you will find a tactic that works for your team, stick with it, go on a massive winning run and the opposition won't change their tactics or force you to change yours. There are loads more problems and you only need to look at forums to see long lists of issues. To me though, it feels more like a game than a simulation, and games can be exploited in different ways that simulations can't. If I was to recommend this game to anyone, it would be to new football manager players, it's a lot more streamlined than it used to be and much easier to figure out. However if you're a long term football manager player, think wisely before you make the purchase because you will recognise some of the same problems from past versions which still haven't been addressed.

												Haven't bought Football Manager since 2013. I made a decision to never waste money on it again back then, as I simply didn't like the repetitive and frustrating direction the gameplay was being taken. The amount of injuries on FM games, regardless what training routine you use, is preposterous and should have been fixed years ago. Here I am again in 2016, still reporting that very problem. A problem that has plagued this franchise from day one. Playing the Beta version of 2017, it's the same old story. Players acting like children, injuries that kill any attempt you make at being successful. (They are relentless and unforgiving). Inexcusable. I can only assume the makers are taking the p*ss.The tactics I find, are useless. I've tried at least five different formations and all have the same problem. Nothing happens but 'INCONSISTENCY'. Star players can't hit a barn door. (Try being Spurs manager - Kane won't score for me, Everyone gets injured all the time. It's a mess. An awful experience. A waste of electricity). Neither can the players ever sort their attitude out. As Juventus manager, I had to turn it off by October. Another awful, problematic squad, that wouldn't perform and were constantly injured.You are bombarded with problems that detract from actual 'fun gameplay'. My players come across as whiney, spiteful creatures, who will do nothing for the shirt for very long. They can't be praised, because they then underperform. If you don't praise them, they underperform. (Wonderful!!! Lots of fun to be had here I see!).The team talks are an assault on my Chi. It doesn't matter what you say, or what tone you say it, INCONSISTENCY and players underperforming is the result. Results and match events, are a continuous slap in the face, making you ask 'what did I say wrong now!???'. Every team talk and press conference is a lottery. What you think is a common sense statement, is actually a trick to ruin your team cohesion. This game is awful. It's actually been developed to make you feel harassed at something you love doing. It can't even be called a 'simulation', because the injuries and the behaviour of the players, is totally unrealistic and contrived to frustrate you.In-game tactical instructions are limited and do NOTHING. You can spend hours trying to figure out what role to give a player and never get it right. Say something the game doesn't like, (99% of what you are given as a choice, ends up in disaster) and your whole squad will collapse. It's totally hit and miss. Fiddle all you like if that's your thing, but you are either getting sacked, or the players will lose faith, or you will switch it off, because at that point, you will realise that you hate your life, that you wasted time on this game's BS and the fact you've wasted all that money on it again.So my question is: What is this 'game'? A virtual reconstruction of what my hell would be like? When did 'games' become a bloody hindrance?You also have that lame old problem, of players complaining about lack of play time, disrupting the squad, even though they've been playing. One minute they are playing well, (the only one in your team mind), then they complain for no reason and you've lost their form all season from that point too. You still can't tell players they are a disgrace and will never play for the club again. They just keep spiting you somehow and you can't do anything about it apart from fine them after a few warnings. (Warnings which do nothing). Anything sets them off. This game makes you feel like putting everyone on the transfer list and breaking your laptop. Every time I press 'continue', it hits me with another slap in the face. It's so convoluted and utterly infuriating nowadays, what's the point of this 'game' anymore? It has no point. It has ruined what everybody loved about football management games and churned out this totally unsatisfying rubbish year after year. But hey, as long as the facia is a bit different, they'll get away with charging you another forty quid. Never again. Never again. This time the bridge will never be rebuilt.			"

												I have been playing Football Manager since 2007 (handeld and full game) and this is by far the worst one I have bought, even worse than 2008 which was the worst one for me. I am doing a career with Bournemouth and I obviously understand that I am not going to win every game 5-0. BUT every game is the same no matter what tactics I use or whether its against Man U or Sunderland.  My team has majority possesion, 15 shots on target, 3 clear cut chances the other team will have 3 shots on target and I draw 1-1 or even worse lose. I understand this happens very rarely in real life but on this game it happens 9 out of 10. Sometimes the other team has only 1 shot on target and I will lose which is so annoying. AND  no matter what tactics I use my team shoots from outside the box, my strikers will literally go through on goal 1 on 1 and shoot from outside the box????????????? It is not realistic at all, Liverpool, Chelsea and Man City all finish mid-table? It is terrible, really terrible. AND to make it even worse they charge Â£30+??? for what??? As far as i can tell there have been no real upgrades to the game that deserve that. Truly pathetic from Sports Interactive and unless I read that there have been major improvements in the next one you have lost a 10 year long customer. BUY FM14 instead.			"

												I highly recommend to not buy this game...  been a pro and long time supporter of these games since cm97/98 and FM17 is the 3rd worst game in the series number one being CM4 and number two being FM16.FM17 is just a prettier version of FM16 with new added features still the same broken game engine and mechanics.  Mac users as well will not benefit with FM17 as the game runs poorly due to a poorly optimized game with in the game menu, to 2D Classic to 3D match engine.  only solution in fixing this issue for macbook pro users is turning off retina support but enjoying a pixellated game ranging from the menus to the game engines.  And the only response from SI about this matter is ""the engine has been improved"".  improved as in broken where FM15 and FM16 ran flawlessly for mac users.And you cant get a refund as by the time you weighed all your options and work arounds which are non existant, ur passed the expiration time.A NO BUY, SPECIALLY FOR MAC USERS.

												In FM16 I enjoyed a decent amount of success, took small clubs up to the bigger leagues etc, in FM17 I'm lucky if I don't concede 4 goals in the first half of a game. Maybe it's just me but, for all the steps SI took in fixing the match engine's broken crosses from last year, it feels like they've taken several steps back in the defensive aspect of the game and also how effective player instructions are.

												So, I am one of the fans that buys the game each year no matter what, but I am not biased. This is only the beta version (the full release will be launched in 4th November) . First Impressions:1.  There is more information than ever, which is easy to access in the panels. Before and after each game you receive a report from your analyst in which you can find every information about the opponent. Yes, in the editions before you could only have a report about the next opponent, but not one after the match. Now, in FM 17 your analyst will compile a summary of the match after it's finished and you can see what went good / wrong. This saves you time of analysing each stat after a game. In my opinion this is one of the most powerful features of FM 17.2. The game runs on 64-bits if you have a 64-bit OS and CPU. This is great because you can feel how fast and responsive the game is. 3. This might be a minor change / addition, but the new skin (the green one) is excellent. Easy on the eye, easy to read and pleasant even at night. 4. I've played about 20-30 games so far and I can really say that this match engine is good. No more overpowered crosses to the back / near post. No more unmarked fullbacks and ultra-concentrated game in the middle. I tried 4-5 different tactics (4-4-2 diamond narrow, 4-4-2 flat, 4-3-3, 4-2-3-1 wide and a strikerless one). Each of these tactics worked as you would expect it too. 5. Scouting not has a new option when you want to get information about a new player (Scout until full knowledge). Not a big deal, but it's a welcome addition.6. The pre-season takes longer then before because you recieve more information and therefor, you access more information. Also, signing a player take a tidy bit longer because of the negociations and so is when offering a new contract to one of your players (in most cases). Comparison to FM 15 and 16.When FM 16 came out I was very excited because I loved the interface, the responsiveness of the game, even the way the font popped out on the background itself. In short, I loved it. The problem was in the match engine and I have to say that it was the biggest dissapointment I ever had in FM. The opponent was defending so narrow that it would leave acres of space down the flanks so your fullbacks were always unmarked. It was almost pointless to play an AMC because you would NEVER take advantage if his creativity since he will 90% of the situations just pass it down the flanks where were your unmarked fullbacks. The second issue was the overpowered crosses.  Because of these 2 big problems I felt compelled to revert back to FM15 (which I loved). Now, FM 17 looks even better than FM16 and the match engine is very good (given the fact that it's only a beta). By the way, I haven't seen any major or big bugs in the game so far. FM15 was a very good edition which provided great functionality, a more than decent match engine, but it felt a bit laggy overall.Things that I think need improving in FM17.1. The player models in 3D on the pitch and the ball itself need some tweaking, minor touches. The ball looks a bit too bright and the player's jerseys seem a bit unclear if you use a distant camera (elevated).2. The colors in Football Manager Light Skin need serious improvement. It has very bad contrast in every aspect. However, the dark skin and the new one (green) look very good. Honestly, I am trying hard to think of ""bad things"" in FM17. After the backlash they got for FM16 match engine, the developers corrected their mistakes big time and they added a lot of new things upon that. Regarding the match engine, I think the progression has stalled because of the setback in FM16, but the good news is that now it's playable and really enjoyable. I hope you find this review useful.

												For the past thounds of hours in this series(I mean literally more than 2000hrs), you can see they made a few patches here and there. however, maybe because there is no real competitive /rival game in the market, a lot of crucial things stay unchanged. For example, the tactic switch from attack to defense or vice versa had never been introduced. As I did in the past 2 version, the tactic German used in world cup is quite powerful, normally gave me more than 5 goals per match, while   you could not move 1 of the AM player into midfield to fill the empty when you lose the ball control. Till now, A typical 433 attack 442 defend is still not achievable , while PES could do it years ago. I haven't mentioned the crappy game engine, in 2017, you could still see the classic mistake for the final defender walk like 80s to a ball 2 meters away, while the attacker easily grab the loose ball and scores. The keeper just stone still. He can speak, speak the same English as the defender, and clearly see the fast approaching attacker, and yet for more than 3 second, he did nothing but just let the defender slowly walk to the ball and lose it. Ridiculous.			"

												Well, first off, I'm going to say that I do not intend to hate on this game what so ever, I'm just hoping someone from Sports Interactive reads this and figures out what's wrong with the game..PROS :- Good animations- Intelligent reporters- Social media (to an extent, it is good, but gets boring very quickly)- Great tactics feautureAnd that's literraly it..CONS : - AI moves around like it's having a stroke most of the time- Goalkeepers are absolutely terrible- Way too many yellow and red cards, even thought you've set your players to hold back- Clear cut chances are broken, some games it'll never ever go in, some games the goalkeeper decides he's gonna ave' a day off- Too repetitiveYup, it's basically a copy and paste of FM16 with some minor tweaks with the animations.PLAYED ON :Intel Core i7-6700HQ 2.6GHz16GB RAM + 1TB HDD + 256GB SSD17.3"" Full HD LED displayNVIDIA GeForce GTX980M 4GBWIFI + Windows 10 64bit			"

												Ive always been an FM fan but this installment is terrible !Once again the game engine is broken like it was in FM16 ... Its a lazy installment with nothing new that impacts the way the game plays  ! I feel fooled by that idiot editor that brought out a 30 minute video explaining why this one is ""so good"" ... Its not and we were all fooled i couldnt not reccommend this game any more than i do right now ... and it further pains me that you cant get a refund because it takes longer than 2 hours to get to a game or to get a true opinion on the game therefore steam wont give you a refund for it... but the game is a broken shambles..1. Social Media is awful .. gives you a positive tweet a negative tweet and a neutral tweet every single time so you learn nothing and it doesnt impact on how the game is played or any of your decisions.If they spent a year sorting that addition out then they massively failed it looks and feels lazy and boring ... underwhelming !2. Match Engine hasnt changed at all its still awful and looks exactly like FM16 .. they still Ice Skate and shoot from the corner flag instead of crossing.3.Forget your tactics nothing will work ! We all know anything can happen in football so when a dodgy scoreline happens you just have to let it go but when you take this into a full season where you beat the top 4 no problem and lose to everybody else you realise that thats still the same broken engine as it was in FM16 . why am i beating chelsea 4-0 and then losing to Burnley home and away 6-0 ? It doesnt work ... go counter attack .. say something to your players .. no matter it doesnt work .. not one time did anything happen or any reflection of my tactics on the field at any time but the only consistency was that you beat the top 4 and lose to most of the rest with a few draws in there4. This is linked with number 3 but in the past 2 for me ive had to go on holiday for the first season because the game does everything it possibly can to get you the sack in your first season ... i just had one with Newcastle and lost 12 out of 16 games against what are minnows in comparison in this division but its the same whatever team you pick .. You have to try and survive the first season just so you can have number 3 in place where you only beat the top teams haha its a joke5. Unrealistic Stupid AI for transfers -  Like always i have to spend Â£180 million pounds for a player  of any worth but if anyone wants my player they want him for Â£5 million less than hes worth and expect me to pay half his wages haha ... the classics are the ok 15 yr olds that clubs want Â£90 million for them ... stupid and pathetic 6.AI performance - sometimes its not just you ... ive received screnshot after screenshot from my mates saying are you experiencing the same as me ... After 20 games or so .. Liverpool, Man City and Everton in the bottom 5 and Burnley etc second hahaha ... On my brothers who has had to uninstall because of how nrealistic it is , Mourinho,Klopp,Guardiola and Wenger got the sack after the first season haha I mean how can that broken â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t be defended ?7. Opposition scoring millions of goals .. your strikers couldnt score in a brothel for example i was at Newcastle .. Mitrovic went 15 games without a goal when everything i did was aimed at attacking ... the only goals i scored was random ones from Shelvey etc but no strikers .. i get the sack he then scores an average 2 goals per game until the end of the season ... now i was thinking maybe it was just a glitch and its just mitrovic or maybe i just messed up ... nope every team i try this same thing happens where the strikers just dont score and i have to rely on midfield to do so ... struggle to get into double figures for them everPapered over cracks and fooled everyone ... A couple of new screens but its mostly updated stats/transfers that you paid for and cosmetic reasons with the picture ... but i wouldnt worry because it makes no difference because youll never beat a minnow again on this broken game where absolutely nothing affects your decisions or how you play the game SHAMBOLIC			"

												This game is so bad. For example all they have changed from last year is the fact they have added in social media feed. Apart from that it contains the good old â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t from last year like pulling players down from corner kicks to give away pens and constant injuries. I can see why the reviews is mostly negative.			"

												I didnt check reviews before purchasing the game. So I am glad if you didnt do the same mistake.Do not buy this game. *Your midfielders are always going to shoot from distance, no matter how many times you tell them not to.*Every cross goes to the goal. *Strikers are useless, always shooting outside. (or the ball hits the bar from the inner side, then hits the ground and somehow goes outside) *Strikers get depressed because of long runs without scoring. (doesnt seem like their fault)*8/10 of all goals are scored from range. (they obviously watched too much payet and pogba while developing the game)It is depressing that the team plays exactly how you want them to. But they are totally unable to score. 25 shots, 3 on target in my last match. It is depressing to watch that in every match. And sometimes it goes totally unbalanced and 3 goals just happen in 3 minutes.I think I'll go back to FM 15 and never going to buy a game before reading reviews again.			"

												The game looks like it's been designed by a group of people who have nothing in common with real football. Just a bunch of programmers who insert some scripts into the game, which lead to random actions from your players. For example, a world class player in your team will make some stupid, beginner, personal errors, at a certain number of games. It does not matter how you train him, or that his stats are fantastic or that he costs 50 millions euros. At a certain number of games he will make some stupid mistakes: pass the ball to an opponent in front of goal, take a stupid red card, miss a series of golden opportunities.Some worldclass players have low stats compared to real life, others are ridiculously better that in the first season of real life. For those of us who like these types of football manager games, we buy it because its the best option, but that does not mean its good.After the successes of past years, Football Manager got its monopoly on the genre market and now they are making sub-par editions, because we are foolish enough to buy them anyway. Please don't make the mistake I did in buying this game.			"

												I played this game during free weekend and I'm not surprised why this game has negative reviews.FM2017 is basically FM2016 with updated database & interface. The match sometimes still doesn't make sense, with 20 shot attempts, 10 shots on target, 1 goal, while opposition also have 1 goal but from only 1 shot on target. Weird, isn't it? Your best striker constantly missing clear chances. Your defenders let opposition player chase the ball instead of chase it themselves and this often results in your team conceding goal. The 3D graphics is still terrible, even PS2 has better graphics & better player movement. Imo this game should just be an expansion pack priced around 10 dollars or less instead of a full priced game.Do you know what will make FM good again? A competition. This genre once had several good games like Championship Manager, FIFA Manager, and LMA manager. Sadly those games don't have newer version, making FM doesn't have competitor and SI release database update yearly with price like a new game. Seriously, this needs to be stopped.			"

												The game has got steadily worse over time and this confirms it. Buggy, awful match engine, unrealistic and it feels like matches are decided by the game before you even kick off regardless of tactics form etc. SI have got lazy and really need to rethink it. Poor, poor game by the standards they had begun to set a few years ago. Not worth the purchase price whatsoever.			"

												I should've listened to the game reviews and not purchase the game.This game's tactic engine is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ to the point where nothing you do is actually applied to the pitch. Player attributes don't make much sense, since a striker with 16 finishing can miss an empty goal from 5 yards.Worst game on steam this year, and worst Football Manager ever?*I get what people say in the comments. Here's an update.*--------Edit: One last update in a few short sentences.*I managed Porsmouth for 5 seasons and then moved up to Spurs. Here's my takeaway. GOD FORBID you're leading against a stronger oponnent in FM 2017, because the match is going to last as long as it f*cking takes for the engine to make sure you lose. From 80th to 93rd minute, you'll actually spend 8 minutes in gametime and watch your team gets painfully crushed, chance by chance, and of course, lose the game. However, when you're the favorite (talking about matches with Spurs against weaker oppositions), and say the match is draw after 60-70 mins, time flys by! I mean, the second half could f*cking finish in 1 minute! You're lucky if you get 1 chance at winning the match. This does not always happen of course, but you'd be surprised how often.----------Edit: That was what I took from the first 5-6 hours in gametime. I continued to play the game, mainly because I bought it and didn't want my money to go to waste. Here are few more thoughts.One of the things that pisses me off, is when you get into stoppage time, no matter where you are, the referee doesn't allow you to finish up the attack. It happened a few times, my team was crossing or doing a very promising counter attack (or was even in front of the goal) in the opposition's half, and the referee stops the game at exactly 92:00 mins.Hot prospects are really annoying as well. They like to get on loan because they're missing first-squad football, but what FM didn't get into account, is that when I list them on loan, or offer them to clubs, nobody freaking wants them! And what do they do? These 17 and 18-year olds get angry, their morale drops to the floor and they don't want to re-sign a new contract with my club. So, how is the manager's fault that they are not yet good enough, and not even a Vanarama National team wants them for their first-team squad?			"

												Oh my god these negative reviews!Here's a summary of them for you:1) No Chinese!2) It's just FM 2016 with a new skin!3) I suck at the game!4) It crashes!Before I go any further, let me remind you at this point in time everyone is playing the BETA version of the game. There will be crashes, there will be bugs. Most of them will probably be fixed on release day. If these bugs are what is putting you off buying, then hold off until release and check back then.With that out of the way:You have to approach the FM series like you would FIFA: Each year is an evolution, not a revolution.Except, where FIFA upgrades their graphics each year to make it look shiny and new, most of FM's improvements come under the hood. The match engine, even in the beta, is a distinct improvement over last year's, with fullbacks no longer dominating match ratings and awards. If you want the football simulator with the most realistic match engine, this is it.Is the game worth the purchase price? Well that depends on how much you're paying and how much value you want for that price. If you're outside the UK and don't want to hedge your bets on a Steam refund, I strongly suggest shopping around online for the best price in pounds, and buying that way. The exchange rates are favourable for pretty much everyone else. I bought it for 29.99 GBP, which converted to NZ$52 including exchange fees, a saving of 42% over the standard Steam price of NZ$89.99 in New Zealand.I've already clocked up over 50 hours, so that's a dollar an hour, and that will only get better.Bottom line: If you are looking for a good football sim, have about 30 GBP of local currency to spend, and don't speak only chinese (you're reading this so that's not an issue), then buy this game.

												By far the worst FM ever. Been playing since 1999, but this game is huge disappointment. ME doesn't respect any of the team instructions, players attributes are not showing any correlation with what's going on on the field. Player prices have no meaning since you have to pay even up to 100 times more than what's being advertised. Huge let down.			"

												Terrible, unrealistic match engine. Hardcore fans don't buy this FM until this major, game breaking bug is fixed.4-4-2/4-4-1-1 in this version is completely broken as wingers/wide midfielders mindlessly stay far too wide defensively and you can't keep a proper defensive shape no matter what mentality, shape, TIs, PIs, OIs you use. They never move infield to help centrally. They refuse to help centrally even if the opposition overloads the central areas. Currently the wingers/wide midfielders are hard-coded to behave like this which is completely unrealistic. There are several threads on the SI forum with several examples:https://community.sigames.com/topic/381957-wingers-too-wide/#comment-10480754https://community.sigames.com/topic/388134-wingers-doesnt-track-backclose-down-opponent-near-him/https://community.sigames.com/topic/388226-how-to-get-wide-midfielders-defending-centrally-in-a-4-4-24-4-1-1/https://community.sigames.com/topic/386503-football-manager-2017-official-feedback-thread/?do=findComment&comment=10535803https://www.reddit.com/r/footballmanagergames/comments/5cdbsp/match_engine_bug_wingerswm_too_wide_4424411_broken/ "

												As a longtime player of Football Manager and Championship Manager before it I have grown increasingly frustrated at the direction the series has been taking. A game called Football Manager should be first and foremost about football, yet every year all the time and effort seems to have been spent on dealing with player contracts and the media. I'm not saying these shouldn't be in the game, but they should be low priority. This year sees the introduction of a social feed, where you get to see tweets from your teams most clueless and repetitive fans, and a player promise system, which ruined game for me, but more on that later.Tactics, something I think should be a high priority, remain incredibly limited, with the ability to issue only vague instructions. There's no way to instruct your players to press hard immediately after losing the ball, but then fall back into formation, no way to tell a player to drift out to both wings like Alan Ball did in the '66 Wold Cup, no way to tell your right winger to cross early and our left winger to look for the overlap. The team width instruction I find baffling. Am I setting up my width for when my team have the ball, or when they don't? I definately don't want the same width instruction for both scenarios, and I can't think of a team which do. Coaching is equally simplistic and vague. Previous versions of the game, going back a fair few years, allowed much more nuanced instructions. Bring back the arrows!Now the promise system. Five of my players became unhappy, because I hadn't kept my promise to strengthe the squad. This suprised me because 1. I had strengthened the squad, and 2. I never promised to strengthen the squad. It's possible that the team's previous manager had made that promise to them, but I did not. Having five players unhappy at me, for something I didn't do, has caused me to give up on this game. What I hoped for is that the games existing mechanics would be improved. What the devs did is leave them unchanged and introduce new mechanics which don't even work well. I imagine if the devs for this game were to make Christmas dinner they'd spend all their time preparing sprouts, chuck a turkey in the oven as an afterthought, and not bother with roast potatoes at all. Not for the first time Football Manager has left me disappointed.			"

												Decided to post a review since the game certainly doesn't deserve the ""mostly negative"" rating.Most of the negative reviews are from butthurt chinese users complaining about the lack of a chinese version even tough the language isn't listed on the supported languages list available on this store page. Others are people complaining about having too much injuries.The game is good, pretty much the same as last year. The interface is neater, post match analysis are clearer than before. The conversations with the journalists, players, board of director are exactly the same as last year, but it's far from the most important aspect of the game so it's alright.If you aren't a chinese who doesn't speak english and happen to like football or just management games you cant go wrong going for it.Edit: Why the hate on my profile dumbass Loda/117? First of all i'm not chinese nor trying to be a hero (lol) so STFU. I don't follow devs or anyone on twitter, so i'm not aware of what has been said there (Here Cyric provided links to what has been said:BDW here is MJ's reply. LOL https://twitter.com/milesSI/status/791659905933533184Here is his 'promise' https://twitter.com/milesSI/status/128969002398646274,)  I look at the store page information to know what's already implemented in a game and some video on youtube. I'm just giving my opinion on the game. Not everyone need chinese language when purchasing the game, so I think the ""mostly negative"" review isn't representative of the game, except if you are chinese and don't understand english.			"

												Daniel Sturridge got injured while I loaded a new game, very realistic 10/10I do recommend this game, but I have reservations as well. Something I've noticed in my 900+ hours is how weak tactics are translated back to us. For example - when I first started playing, I was seeing the most absurd behaviour from my players; daft goalkeeping errors including ""hilarious"" own goals, ridiculous backpasses, stupid defensive howlers, players running head-first into opposition defenders to sloppily concede possession, incredible open-net misses, endlessly hitting the woodwork.. the list goes on. It actually feels very unfair; I would much prefer weak tactics to be blatantly obvious so that the uninitiated might clearly understand what needs fixed (or at least why it is going wrong). Sadly all you get as feedback is a load of old nonsense, the kinda things that real-world footballers just would NOT do, certainly not with such startling regularity.But rcently, since starting to use strong [proven] tactics, I've been seeing a very different game. Beautiful and organic ""pass and move"" football, regular screamers, up-and-coming youngsters terrorising defences with eery precociousness while I scream in delight (and pat myself in the back for having the balls to name that 17yr old against Chelsea like I never doubted his ability). I've won a few Bundesliga titles, Premier League, FIFA World Cup, UEFA European Championship, UEFA Champions League, Serie A TIM... the list goes on. I am absolutely loving it.So when you get your tactics right, be prepared to be enthralled with FM17. Get them wrong however, and you will be banging your head against your desk in brain-melting frustration.DO NOT MAKE PROMISES. If a contract negotiation lists any promises, simply use the ""remove and exclude from negotiations"" option for each one. The player nor the agent will care and will still accept the contract. If you add the promises (especially ""strengthen the coaching team/defence/midfield/attack"") you will fail no matter what. Players never notice even when you massively strengthen the area you promised them, and will come back to you complaining that you broke your promise. This can affect the entire squad and WILL ruin your game.AI Managers are idiots. They never make long-term plans for any club, and will just sign players almost arbitrarily, use up all available budget, put the club into debt if they can, and get the sack when it starts to go wrong. Also - I've never seen Jurgen Klopp or Pep Guardiola last more than a season with Liverpool or City respectively, in more than 20 saves.One little quirk about FM that I've also noticed - players ALWAYS seem to score against their old clubs, whether that is against your club, or one of your players when you play his old club. I take advantage of this by intentionally playing players against their old clubs and it never fails to deliver; (as an example) I've had Danny Ings score 4 in a single match against Burnley and then not another goal all season until we play them again and he gets a hatrick.Players also seem to score their first goal for their club/of the season/ever against you. All goal droughts are ended when a human-controlled team comes to town. It happens too often to be coincidence. FM loves drama.PROS:Stupidly addictive. Sometimes I forget to feed my kids.A massive game with a mind-bending amount of players, staff, and teams to manage.Extremely rewarding when you get tactics right.It's the only football management game worth playing at the minute.CONS:Stupidly addictive. My kids are hungry.Players promises don't work and will ruin your game. You have been warned!Assistant manager in-match advice is akin to a parrot on your shoulder.Game feels very harsh and unfairly balanced if your tactics are weak.Far too much repetitive media.AI managers are stupid.Training needs a proper overhaul.Sensible score: 8/10, a few niggles hold it back from greatness.

												Nonsense as usual. I can lose games even with 5 times the number of chances created, and striking the post 3 to 4 times a game is so common whereas after 60 hours of gameplay I never saw any of my opponents hit the woodwork! This nonsense is so rigged in favour of the AI. How many long range shots and defensive mistakes do I need to endure when my players keep missing simple one on ones? Nonsense game, this will be the last ever FM I will buy and the same should apply for all of you reading this too. Match Engine still â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, players show no ambition though they lose 5 games in a row. idiotic waste of money			"

												If you own a previous game keep playing that, there is not really anything in this game that makes it worth it. If you don't own any Football Manager games then it's an ok game, but be prepared for hundreds of bugs. Most are kinda small but annoying. SIgames  isn't giving any effort anymore. Their forum wich used to be good is horrible with mods who remove anything that is not praise. Miles Jacobsen, the boss, is the man who is ultimately the reason for the regression of the game. Everytime i hear him speak i'm reminded of the fact that he doesn't know jack about anything. Save yourself the money and buy a real game.			"

												Like many of the recent years' entries, one again another one arrives with some improvements, but core aspects of the game remain poor, if not outright broken at launch.As the same as in previous years, the goalkeeper AI is hideously unpredictable with a healthy dose of fumbling the ball either into his own net or in front of someone who instantly puts it in the net.  In addition, distribution from the goalkeeper is DIRE.  Far too many kicks go directly to opposition players who are standing in acres of free space.Defenders, AI is also poor, either that or tactics are not being recognised correctly.  No matter how much you tell them to close down, tackle hard, man mark... nope, you can guarantee that if the ball is crossed in from the wing or from any distance, it will land at the feet of the opposition striker who has NO ONE within 5-10 years, and he then skins them to score.Passing, also DIRE.  Either an issue with the engine or again poor AI/recognition of tactics.  Short passing and retaining possession for instance is irrelevant... the team will still try long balls and miss their supposed target by a country mile. Same thing as Goalkeepers basically.About the only one that works is strikers... they seem to get a realistic number of goals/assists, a goals to shots ratio.And also, there seems to be a heavy imbalance towards ""smaller"" teams to boost them against larger player teams.  Yes there's some ""cupsets"" that take place in the real world, but dominating performances seem non-existent.  Same effect seems to apply in the league games where a team that's got 3 wins out of 30 will suddenly destroy you 5-0 when you're at home.So yeah... as always, the game has launched with a sense of imbalance/bugs/brokenness that will probably not get fixed for 3 months.In short... after just over a week since early-access, I'm close to uninstalling it and this will definitely be the last version of Football Manager I buy.  The whole series has been a frustrating, broken mess since they brought in the 3D match engine.It's just not worth the effort now.  So, I'll be retiring at the end of the season.  Let someone else deal with this.			"

												Disregarding the weird reviews about no Chinese localization, can't see how anyone would be mad about this. Players make better decisions altogether and it seems like an actual football game for probably the first time since FM2012. Full-backs are no longer tragically overpowered, crosses can still be pretty potent but if you have a solid defense then they tend to not go brain-dead very often. UI is great, too.Only flaw right now that I'd really point out is that the requirements for a key pass are REALLY stringent. This is better than the past few versions where you'd have a right-back pumping out 300 key passes a season, but now you'll only have, like, 30 from your primary playmaker.			"

												As with all of the FM games the concept will always make the game fantastic but for what is effectively a jazzed up spreadsheet Â£34.99 is very pricey!The game was released early November and its now mid February and it still costs Â£34.99, shocking really.I've played these games for 10 years and it would be good to get some sort of loyalty discount as every new release is basically an update of records.overall 7/10 from me, FM will always be awesome but the price vs any new features stops it being anything more.

												The best FM yet. To those complaining about the injuries, (and I was one of them) I've followed some advice on how best to prepare my team for the new season, with training and workload. It appears to have helped a lot. But SI have also said they will look into this matter internally in case there is an issue. I think that's a win win. But injuries aside, apart from the usual beta bugs this is one heck of a great release. It's far better than any other version I've owned (13 onwards). Lots of new features, and much improved 3d match engine graphics in my opinion. Super fun. If I can get anywhere near the time I invested in FM16, which was over 2200 hours, I will be extremely happy.			"

												I've played the Football Manager games since FM2009 and have around 1000 hours dumped into it. Perhaps this is the reason I'm not so enthralled by the latest one. It's gotten to the point now where you can't see the wood for the trees when it comes to actual managment. Saying that, if you're a control freak bent on controlling every aspect of the club, you'll probaly enjoy it. Though it doesn't do anything different from FM2016 in that regard. If you just want some fun to wind down after work, I'd say look elsewhere. The match engine will drive you absolutely insane with the stupid things your players will do, some of the times you interact with players leaves them saying illogical and inconsistent things that can seep into the rest of your team and upset them and don't even get me started on how useless your backroom staff are...Sorry, but this game doesn't do it for me.

												Same issues as last year. Only, if possible, worse. They've done NOTHING to advance the game. If you do a quick google search on ""ideas to implement in FM"", you'll find a million great ideas from fans that give a â¥â¥â¥â¥. But alas, no. Nothing, not even the courtesy to fix some of the problems that we raised last year and the year before.Social News is the biggest ""â¥â¥â¥â¥ you"" this game has ever given to its fans. Who honestly thought that would be a good idea? How does it impact the game to see the same twitter messages over and over again? But fret not, they've also added a ton of new staff roles - THAT DOES NOTHING. Yes, NOTHING. For the club who has everything! But you know what SEGA? You got me by the balls. And you damn well know it. I'm going to keep purchasing this parody of a manager game, because you're the only half decent option out there. You'll keep â¥â¥â¥â¥ing me in the â¥â¥â¥ with a God to honest smile on your face, and I'll keep taking it. But I'm a person that only plays one game, and I'm a minority in the gaming world. Most of your fans have several games they indulge in, and someday they will stop buying your game. We'll go down together, only this time I'll be smiling. So tuck in for the ride, SEGA.

												Once again SI failed to deliver a decent game. FM17 is actually a polished version of last year's game. Match engine is worse than ever. Goals often scored or conceded under 10' in a match. Opoosition scores a goal after a single shot on target. Opposition GK makes the best game of his life but still gets under 7 rating. Tactics don't really matter in a match. The game is design to cheat. Too many injuries during a match. I would suggest to people to STAY away fro this game. It's a waste of time and money. For those who have FM16 just update the transfers and stick to that.			"

												What could be a very good game is being ruined by a serious problem with the match engine, and that is defending. Whoever I play with the defence leak goals. Not simply with attacking set ups but with any set up. Attacking, balanced, defensive whatever the number of goals conceded are ridiculous. Every corner or cross results in a goal as the defence simply walk away from the attacking players leaving them a free header at goal, this is surely a glitch. This ruins the motivation I have for the game because no matter what tactics, player intrusctions, oposition instructions or training I try, the other team always win because although I dominate possession, shots and shots on target for the say 3 goals I score, the opposition will always have four shots on target and win 4-3. The fact I am clearly trying to fight a computer ruins my interest in the game because If the game has decided I won't be allowed to win, then it's an impossible task. So far I have only played with three teams on the game those being Leeds, Guiseley and Newcastle. I was tired of losing every match 6-5 or 5-4 or 8-0 with Leeds or Guiseley so I did a test save with Newcastle to see if it was my tactics that were awful or if the game really was screwing me over. Newcastle in the championship obviously should be an easy task. It was all going well until January top of the league 6 points clear then the defence started to leak a few goals and a few losses started creeping in. No matter, a simple dip in form. However, the last 10 games of the season saw the problem return, I lost all of the last 10 games of the season, with scorelines such as 7-0, 8-0, 5-4, 4-3, and I went from leading the championship by six points to finishing 4th, at which point I was sacked. So my point is quite clear. With the new features that I am sure you will hear about and probably see for yourself if you buy the game, Football Manager 2017 has the potential to be one of the best in the series. But until this defensive glitch and screw job mentality of the match engine is fixed, this game cannot be enjoyable and so at this time I cannot reccomend it.			"

The intelligence of the players is moronic, i thought they were supposed to be improving that? The strikers dont score, no matter who you have.

												I've been a long term fan of the franchise, I've put over nearly 1600 hours in the last two titles. So buying this was a no brainer for me. But there are certain problems which make this game a non recommend for me.1. I think that FM17 is too much like FM16, the only major difference for me is the ""twitter"" feed from the supporters. Because of the small (and insignificant) differences between last years version and this one, I don't think I want to leave my save file from 16 behind. Which is not a good thing. FM16 did that, FM16 made me want to start my adventure all over again. 2. What is wrong with the goalkeepers? I've seen Neuer or Courtois just diving over easily catchable balls! SI said they would address this issue but I think they've accidentally made them worse! 3. There are certain problems with the press conferences which makes it impossible for me to create a good relationship with certain managers. I'll say something positive about Mourinho, he'll say something positive about me. But then the media (post-match) will invent something that was supposedly said, but was never actually said! This will cause Mourinho to be mad at me! I miss the days from FM11 where I could just talk about other managers instead of every journalist trying to make every manager in the league hate me!			"

												It's better than the previous edition. If you only buy for new features, don't buy this. If you buy for a free flowing game, the update, and some extra cosmetics - buy it. Tactics actually matter and if you compare matches between FM16 and FM17, the difference is stark - midfielders are not guaranteed to be the best on the pitch, tactics must be tweaked to work since crossing no longer can bang you in all the goals, keepers are more likely to make those easy saves - all good so far.It's a better FM, and those who still complain should have a look at their tactics rather than continue to whine. Also, as many have said but I'll reiterate - reviews are mixed because the Chinese whine when things are not delivered to them on a plate.			"

A low class striker can score hatrick within 10 mins. 5. All opposition teams will play like Barcelona with higher posession and shots on target. 6. And finally 30 yards goal from midfield who has long shot rating of 4!!!7. You should have 3 or 4 Tactics ina match to get a good result.Patched version of 2016. Nothing big to cheer about. 1. But on the brighter side, more realistic with transfers, training. 2. Match rating works like real time. Even when your team wins, players who played bad get bad rating. Now you know when to sub him.3. Social feeds looks good but eventualy boring as you progress.4. Might change after the 1st update.			"

												I have played football manager since 2008 and this is a continuation of the terrible match engine in 2016 that made me stop at the demo then. I appreciate the social feed but even that is not as detailed as the press conferences and unrealistic. I will start with the bad reviews.1. I bought Icardi at Arsenal for about 40m pounds and the social feed had the exact same reaction to buying Correa for 13, no real football fan would be mad at their club for buying Icardi and also when he scores a hattrick in a match and wins player of the game, the reaction is similar to when he scores 1 goal and wins it, some doubters and some believers. No one irl will doubt the effectiveness of a hattrick hero in game.2. I take 15 shots and get only 3 on target, Even Sanchez misses clear cut chances regularly, Sanchez 17 apps: 4 goals and 4 assists, shooting well below 30% and missing most shots on target. Lots of players miss seemingly easy sitters too. Then AI gets 1 shot and 1 goal, in games when I have more shots on target, the AI's keeper turns into a Neuer but Cech rarely steps up when needed.3. Strikers and Wingers cannot shine simultaneously, Icardi is beasting but at the cost of Sanchez and Ozil being next to useless.4. Small teams pose huger threats than imagined and my world class team feels unequipped to handle league 2 teams or at least as equipped as they are against smaller PL teams. I believe irl, a team like Barcelona can take some teams easily with little to no guidance from their coach, same cannot be said for FM where I cannot trust my players to deal with puny teams as my players never hit the target and end up being susceptible to counter attacks5. Using strictly control without aggressive attacking mentality not enough to shut off counter attack moves and defense always makes sloppy errors opponents never make (Koscielny leaving a striker wide open to join Mustafi and Bellerin who already have an attacker covered).6. Team performance based on attributes not comparable to AI, ref: Sanchez finishing of 16/20 but missing almost every sitter he has. Bellerin pace 20 still running comparably to much slower counterparts (not much to present a huge issue though) (But I wish it reflected real life where Bellerin's pace and ability to track back is his biggest asset)7. Transfers are one-sided, I had to pay well over the odds for Icardi but I could not offload Giroud for his market value, seems like every time I try to sell, I always get lowballed with no negotiating power.8. (Good review) Acquiring young popular talent is a bit more realistic and I cannot just build a future juggernaut team for 30m like in the past games.9. Not enough tactical fluidity and players end up being rigid, always plays down the wing and when I go up against defenders strong in the air, I lose. Even when I try to exploit the center and Ozil, the ball always gets to the wing and the overlapping full back- wing back combo is overplayed and most games are decided by the wingers and never the CAM.10. ""Our engine has fewer injuries than real life"", yeah yeah, but when my players always get injured on clockwork, it becomes iffy, once Sanchez comes back, Cazorla and Mustafi go, and one time, I simmed through the same international break like 5 times before I was able to get a scenario without an injury...gosh. And the training injuries are a lot. Maybe they tried to be realistic but I didn't appreciate Cech getting injured for 3 months since irl the last time that happened was in 2014 and before that was in 2007 but it happened in less than a month of my being in charge. Maybe it is realistic but I dunno, the injuries for me aren't a dealbreaker, the match engine especially with the SOT and clear cut chances missed are my biggest issue.All in all, I feel like returning this game but I probably won't, just gonna hope SI fixes the game and get my dreams broken and buy fm18 because FM has no competition and no reason to get their â¥â¥â¥â¥ together.

												This is my first review but i think it's a necessary one.I'm supporting SI Games since CM4.I spent more time to this series comparing to any other genre.As of 2017 release i'm now %100 sure that they are lying about this so called ""1000000 new feature"" thing.They have the best database and that database is unrivaled,no other ""manager"" game can get that quality or no other big company trying to achive that.Football Manager is maybe the only game that has no single rival in it's genre.FIFA dominating the sales but there is at least a PES strong rival or weak one that's up to you but at least they are rivals.This game or 2016 or 2015 they are all the same we are in 2017 and the 3D stuff they added is worst then some 1 man powered indie studios.They didn't add a proper ""new"" future in years they are making this little fix and calling it a new feature and adding it to 100000000 new feature list.If a miracle happens and a passionate Football lover indie studio gets SI's database they can blow this already outdated game with forward thinking,truly new ideas.I wish other studio that tried to do a CM sequels were still in business and received a proper support/budget.

												I've been playing for several years now and there's just no change to the way the game plays. Essentially, it's incrementalism every single year. The social feed is pointless when it's all generated and the match engine looks pretty much like last years.  The AI is still not very good, especially when you start getting into the regens. It becomes laughable at times to play because the AI do not know how to build a team and set them up in a way to challenge you.  Still the same bugs every year and I can't even play it anymore because there are bug issues with loading.

If u can look past this, this still is the best manager out there.For the newcomer, buy FM16 first for cheap and try that... liking that one? wait for a sale and then buy FM17 becuase in my opinion it's not worth the 55,- euro *(be smart don't buy on steam at all ! saved me 20,-)Will need to recommend this game or not, no middleway unfortunely so that's why i choose NO. I will change this review when the game is official out, IF it's gived me reason to do so.			"

												I really love the presentation of this game but it is quite simply too hard.The AI is very quick to work out your tactics and even the worst teams and managers can win easily.You can easily outplay computer controlled teams and have 20+ shots compared to the computers 2 or 3 shots and lose, this happens far too often to be realistic, I mean for example teams know how the likes of Barcelona are going to play can they stop them?I buy football manager every year but I'm very disapointed with the difficulty of this game, it takes away all the enjoyment.

												Fix the bugs!Its been over a month now and we are still not able to sign German youngsters and stars in the bundesliga...Use to be my go to game, but the last few versions put out, is more and more bug prone, and iÂ´ve been reduced to a paid beta bug finder - what gives SI!?!.Dont buy until after march - thats when the last major update will be put out. Dont know if it will be a better game, but after that they will focus on Roster update 18..But really - dont buy it this year.			"

												I play this type of games since Premier manager 98 (on PS1) but I don't like this product at all.Pros:+help with player instructions (eventhough this can kill passion for the game)+some little helpfull explanationsCons:- so disgusting,iritating 3d play (better old ""only comentary"" mode)- false club badges,YEAR 2017!!!- saving game lasts so long that i often think game crashed- very slow gameplay- no famous player images- sometimes unrealistic results (30 shots- 0 goals),etc.I was huge fan of FM in the past but now I really don't know where this franchise is going.Without doubt I would rather buy Fifa 17 or Pes 2017.

												Very suprised at all the negative reviews especially as the people giving them are complaining about no improvements and new features, or the classic its the match engines fault. Also a lot of people saying SI and Miles have conned us with the lack of updates!!! Thing is they release a demo every year that lets you play 6 in game months as many times as you want. Which would give anyone who is unsure about the game a chance to experience what you are getting. Yet people still rush in complain about features yet put in an average of 40+ hours gametime and rant on here. I personally feel the game is a massive improvement from FM16 and all previous versions. The match engine is as stable as I have known one on and around release date. If your a football fan it is a must have addition to your collection. And before you buy it and end up unhappy once again there is a DEMO try it first!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												Thank you, SI! Thank you for destroying my last hopes regarding the Football Manager franchise.I am playing this game since 2005 and every year I hope it is getting better. Well, it does not; each each it goes from bad to worse.And what makes it ever more catastrophic is the updates; I had rather good impression about FM 2017, but after the last update the game logic went completely wild. These is no game without 4 goals and tactis are completely nonsence. I win 4-0 away, and then I lose 4-0, to win again 4-0. In a season that I did not score more than 2 goals before the update.I will make sure I never buy this game again.			"

TL:DR If you're a new player, wait for a sale. If you're a returning player from FM14/15/16, this isn't worth full price, maybe at a steep discount or if you're really dedicated to the new features (upgraded transfers, In-Game Editor, better keepers, AI Fantasy Draft), otherwise I'd avoid.Keep in mind, this is the full game with In-Game Editor enabled, not the ""Touch"" version, which is included in the price. Also, excuse any grammar or spelling issues.Football Manager 2017 is a hard one. It combines my love for the sport, as well as taking a step into the feet of a manager, who's always under pressure from their board, media and his players. FM is the leader of this genre, and I love it. However, I've been playing this franchise since FM14, and with every edition, I've put between 100-250 hours into every title. Looking at the differences between FM16 (or even 14/15) and FM17, I see no reason to pick this up for 55â¬, unless, like me, you're really dedicated to the new features/changes that comes with this new edition.+ Excellent menu design compared to FM16, which was quite complex compared to 17, which has been majorly improved to see more in the same menu;+ Updated players database;+ Steam Workshop integration is, as always, a more than welcome addition, and in some cases, even necessary (lack of licenses, shown below);+ In-Game Editor has been revamped to add an availability to get or send players out with a loan, to bind a transfer fee to players instead of sending them out with a free transfer;+ Keepers have been given an upgrade, with more saves and more movements, instead of being a sand bag standing in their goal. Now they can actually do something;+ Better loading times (between matches, creating or loading a new game);+ Upgraded main menu (your manager is now universal, you can use it in every game mode and it's really easy to use, you can even get a 3D model of your face!);+ Fantasy Draft is no longer only against human players, but you can also include AI!;= Licensing issues in several competitions (changed or shortened off club names (A. Madrid instead of Atletico Madrid, no logo's), thanks EA;= The Editor (not In-Game) still lacks explanation for new users;= Press conferences are still really bland, and lack depth, I always hand them over to my assistant manager, just because it's always the same. Thankfully, that option is there, as well as an option to turn them off in the Editor;- The price-to-features ratio is idiotic. 55â¬ for a revamped FM16 with a couple of new or changed features, for the majority of the people playing on older versions, this is NOT worth the money;- Still lots of bugs in the match engine (in the Instant Result menu, there's a bug in the IR feature which causes the assistant manager to place players all over the place (for example, strikers as defenders, while I've clearly set them up as strikers, wth?);- Input from users/gamers to SI have known to be worthless, they implement some new features, but by far not all of them.This game falls under two categories:If you are a new player or haven't picked this title up for some years: then this could be worth it. I would hold off for  sale if I were you, unless you're desperate to play some FM, and believe me, it's good, it's just not worth the full price they're asking. 30-35â¬ would be much more reasonable.If you are a returning player and you own/have played FM12 or up: then this is not worth the upgrade/55â¬ they're asking. It has some new features, but it's like CoD, it's almost the same thing every year, except for some small upgrades/changes that usally end up pretty good. However, if you own FM14/15/16, I would wait another year, unless you're dedicated to the new features or updated playerbase.For now, I'd give this a ""mixed"", but since that's not available, for this price, I am giving this one a thumbs down.Final conclusionA: Must have;B: Great game, worth it, either with or without a discount;C: It's an OK title, I would only recommend this if it's discounted;D: Not worth it, unless it's majorly discounted;E: Terrible title/not finished/broken, do not pick this title up under any circumstances;F: Early Access, usual caveats/warnings apply;			"

												Don't let the ""Mostly Negative"" fool you it seems to just be more than a few disgruntled Chinese players who are annoyed there's still no Chinese language feature. Now for my review.My first 3 hours have been great and have reminded me why this is the only game series I bother pre-ordering. The new UI looks a lot sharper and cleaner but will still be familiar to players of the series. The new social media feature is also pretty cool as well in my opinion. So far in the beta I've encountered no game breaking bugs or any bugs for that matter, and the fact that in my Arsenal save (COYG) I lost a first team player for 2 months to injury during a damn intrasquad friendly tells me the game is working well. I will keep updating this review throughout the beta but for now this game is looking like money well spent.EDIT: I do often wonder at times in FM games how much of an effect your tactics truly have. You can set up a high class team against some distinctly lower level opposition to play control but rarely will you ever feel like you've truly dominated a match and had a one sided outing as does happen in real life. Of course large teams don't always have their way but they do more often than not. Also, and this was the case in 16 as well, it seems that as soon as you score the opposition will always fire back almost immediately, regardless of your defensive setup or how the match was going beforehand. I'd like to know if the rest of you are having the same gripes as I am though I am happy to report that I have yet to encounter any really game breaking bugs only one instance where my manager avatar got deleted for some reason.EDIT: It's gotten to a point where I genuinely believe that the match engine will just â¥â¥â¥â¥ with you whether or not it makes sense. I've had matches where I concede within two minutes despite having my world class defenders against much lesser opposition. After maybe 40 minutes we'll bounce back, not two minutes later the opposition has the lead again and this happens no matter who you're playing against. I also feel my tactical instructions will be ignored, I set my team up to clear the ball to flanks but all balls go straight down the middle, shorter passing never works and the team constantly loses the ball with hopeless overhead through ball attempts. At this point I'm not sure whether or not selecting ""Retain Possession"" even does anything. For better or worse though this is the closest thing to football management and as such I will still reccomend it but oh my it seems the same old flaws keep repeating, making the game force feed â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t to players does not constitute balanced difficulty in the slightest. Veterans of the series will encounter the same issues in a prettier engine and new players will have to steel themselves and prepare for inevitable rage quits. Is FM the Dark Souls of football sims? Seems like it's trying to be.			"

												Long time fan of the series, since the days of Championship Manager.I tried a few saves some with really big teams, and a few with really small teams and I left this game with the smae feeling everytime, this is by far the worst game made by SI. The changes from 16 to 17 are so minor and underwhelming that it makes me wonder what the developers are doing, because FM is their only game and they release it 2 and a half months after the season starts in most of the leagues in europe. So they spend around 9 months doing nothing, and then change the database and ship it out.			"

												I played this game during free weekend and I'm not surprised why this game has negative reviews.FM2017 is basically FM2016 with updated database & interface. The match sometimes still doesn't make sense, with 20 shot attempts, 10 shots on target, 1 goal, while opposition also have 1 goal but from only 1 shot on target. Weird, isn't it? Your best striker constantly missing clear chances. Your defenders let opposition player chase the ball instead of chase it themselves and this often results in your team conceding goal. The 3D graphics is still terrible, even PS2 has better graphics & better player movement. Imo this game should just be an expansion pack priced around 10 dollars or less instead of a full priced game.Do you know what will make FM good again? A competition. This genre once had several good games like Championship Manager, FIFA Manager, and LMA manager. Sadly those games don't have newer version, making FM doesn't have competitor and SI release database update yearly with price like a new game. Seriously, this needs to be stopped.			"

												I made a dream 11 with Rotherham in the Championship, I use control to dominate games, Including Messi, Higuain who is acctually better than Ronaldo on it, Neuer, Kante, Chiellini, Bonucci... To motivate my players im still having to use the underdog mentallity for team talks, no pressure, pick up where you left off... No matter what you do, how you play, the A.I 99% of the time will score past you, I have 25+ shots everygame, the A.I will have 1 shot on target and it's a goal, as i've mentioned my defensive players, you can imagine how poor this can be fount to people. I've played 13. won 10, draw 3.. including going 1-0 and 2-1 down v a league 1 team.. If I was playing attacking or overload i'd accept the goals conceded, I play control with every player high on morale, 1 shot on target v Neuer and it goes in almost everytime..Also, in real life when surprises happen, on FM, you know their happening and you CAN'T do anything about it.. I've had reasonable success, took ipswich up first season, was top with Blackburn first season until i got injuries.And the worst, the official forum is full of people that love and defend the game, any contstructive criticism gets you ban warnings and threads closed. Very unprofessional bunch of moderators on their mixed with fm lovers who wont here a bad word about the game.. Most of them also act like moderators.. Gutted really as I love football management games, but FM is just abysmal.To top it off, i've read you need to create a persona and never change it else it effects your players mentally bad in the long term which will put them off form and so on... This is a joke, so your basically a life actor playing a computer game... Too much detail, too much info, the A.I are way to smart.. you have to change your tactics to surprise them, like when in real life do managers change tactics when their teams bang on form? on fm youl go 15 unbeaten, then 15 not winning with the same tactic, its that bad.. if you like this its up to you.. I get excited to play it, then when I load it up, all the poorness comes back in to my head... In real life, Wingers can play either as wingers or inside forwards depending on the situation in the match, on fm you force the players decision.. Really dissapointed.			"

Defenders shocking stand so far apart may as well be off the pitch, strikers couldn't hit a barn door with a banjo and overall just terrible.

												i am and always will be a FM fan but this installment is so broken i don't think it can be fixed. - The goal keepers missing saves they should be making - the game decides for you whether you are getting the sack (you can't save your job at all) - transfers are far too expensive for clubs - Every time someone scores a goal outside the box is pathetic - Every time a player complains about not having enough game time when there your best player and played all season - Every time someone in the social feed says your player who was the clear motm wasn't bloody stupid inclusion- Every time you concede or lose to a team you clearly shouldn't be drawing or conceding to usaually it's last minute and a wonder goal from outside the box.They need to work on a patch for this to fix it and F##cking quickly how can you release such a poor version when 2016 was so good? but do you the person reading this buy it? not right now no it â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor beyond a joke they released it in this state.

												Review for those who haven't played a Football Manager game before: FM is the most detailed and the best football manager game in existence. It can be very overwhelming to get into, but once you get a hang of it, it is the closest you get to actually land a job at a professional football club. If you like simulation games and like football you will like FM2017Review for those who have played FM before, and consider 2017: I think it is worth it. I have played 10 hours since beta release yesterday 6 pm. The match engine is better, the game runs a lot faster, the data analysis is very improved, scouting is improved a lot, the interface is very intuative. All in all it is a better game than FM 2016 and 2015 and it is well worth the price			"

												Worst football manager I've ever played, every goal you concede is a low drilled cross from the byline, I always concede a goal in the 70-80th bracket without fail, I don't even know how you could even get around that issue..... all it shows is that the game engine is broken and predictable.Dont select aim for penalty spot for corners, your player will without fail cross it outside the box. One match my player tackled my OWN goalkeeper and laid off the ball to the striker, 1-0 down. Then my keeper rolled the ball out to himself and walked straight into their striker who tackled him and put it away for 2-0. I don't think I've ever seen one of those incidents in a game let alone both in the same game! I can understand mistakes, but those aren't mistakes, thats just match fixing behaviour.Player wanted to leave, told him he couldn't leave the whole squad complains that I've blocked his move. Sell player, squad complains I sold player....... what????Social feed is terrible, player got a hattrick and your supporters feed will say ""I don't think he had a great game"" yeah ok.I could go on with some of the other crap I've encountered but don't really wanna waste anymore time.Don't waste your time either, play older versions.

												One of the best parts of Football Manager is being able to sign players at the end of their contracts.  But si decided to add a gamey Brexit feature, something that hasn't even happened in real life and may not .  After putting many hours into the game, i get told i can no longer sign British players at the end of their contracts, oh did i tell you i am a British team, oh but i need to apply for work permits to sign European players also. Its already impossible to sign players outwith EU, now i need permits for players in Europe as well, who the hell am i suppose to sign now.  This is so stupid imo and ruins a great part of the game.  You should be able to turn this feature off at least or be told at the beginning of the game what brexit you are going to get.  This is football manager, a football management sim not politics simulator.  Totally ruined the game for me after spending so much time on itAlso si being si, while trying to fix bugs (which there is many) fix one part of the game and ruin another.  The match engine was fine but after the recent update, players are back to doing all the stupid things from fm16Miles should stop being so arrogant. Thinking he is never wrong and some god among men and listen to the people who have played the game for years.  Stick to 16 if you have it at least you can have fun signing players at the end of their contracts without worrying about a stupid feature coming in that will stop you doing that			"

												Honestly I wanted to recommend this game, I really love this franchise (I played 800hrs on the last one alone) but there are too many problems for me to recommend it right now. I know a lot of you will say 'but itâs in beta' which is true but I have played FM every year in beta since they started doing it and frankly not that much changes from the beginning of beta to release.The first major issue I have are the injuries; excessive injuries have been a ridiculous mainstay of the FM franchise for the last few years making it infuriating to play without the in-game editor to heal some of the more ridiculous ones. Iâm really tired of this being such a problem it surely shouldnât be that hard to fix, 8/10 games have at least one serious injury for one of the teams which is just absurd and god forbid if you actually manage a top club where you have players going off to play internationals because 50% will come back injured. The result of this is if you manage a big club you will have a comical revolving door of players returning/getting injured.My other major issue with this game are the defender/ goalkeeper AI. They appear to have tried to fix defenders from last year as they had a miraculous ability to push opposing players 10feet if they were to contest a ball but while they appear to have fixed this; defenders are now incredibly dumb. SI claim that players make twice the decisions they did previously, I see no evidence of this players seem no smarter. Defenders particularly, they have no ability to read danger they literally cannot track opposing players and if you play any remotely aggressive tactics then opposing players will pass around your defenders like they are training cones (or Daley blind). This defensive weakness is made all the worse by the goalkeepers, I literally have no idea what SI were thinking I can only assume they spent all their time on the new goalkeeper animations (which just look funny as a keeper will go from stationary to fully airborne in a millisecond often diving over the ball when just a simple save was required). Goalkeepers now spring about in flamboyant jumps but they literally only make wonder saves, if a ball is flying towards the top corner of the net there's a good chance they'll stop it but if your grandma has taken a shot down the middle of the goal they literally have no chance, springing over it like a scared cat.I have also been greatly disappointed by Miles Jacobson practices of late not only with his disgraceful handling of the deal he made with Chinese fans to do with translating the game, but also his exploitative business model towards loyal fans of the series. First of all, the controversy regarding the Chinese localisation came about as a result of a deal that Miles Jacobson made with Chinese fans that if FM sold a certain amount more copies of newer FM games than previous ones in china then future FM games would have Chinese localisation. Chinese fans were outraged that this deal had not been honoured in this version because they felt that they had easily reached their target citing steam spy for figures as evidence. Miles Jacobson claims that they had not reached the target saying instead that steam spy figures are often incorrect and in this case by up to 60%. Frankly this seems unlikely given such a widespread backlash, I mean look at the sheer volume of negative reviews on steam this surely shows that there is a large following for the game in china that cares about the product. Even if it is true that they had not reached the target would it have been so hard to translate have the game translated as a goodwill gesture toward a loyal fan base especially as this is such a successful franchise. Honestly this just seems like another example of the complacency and laziness that has become a mainstay of the FM franchise of late probably due to this game having no real competition (honestly look at the match engine it looks 10years old)The second reason I am dismayed by Miles Jacobson's behaviour is his pre-order policy to take advantage of loyal fans. FM17 came with what seemed like a fairly generous offer for loyal fans who received a discount based on how many previous FM games they owned up to 20%. However, while this may seem generous at first glance this truly seems like a very cold calculated move to exploit loyal fans who have bought the game every year. This is because the deal was not simply a pre-order bonus but it required blind faith as it was only available for a short time before any details about the game had even been released! (apart from the name) Miles Jacobson claims in an interview (http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-11-01-attacking-someones-family-over-a-video-game-is-not-acceptable-miles-jacobson) that it is an 'early bird' reward for loyal fans. How does that even remotely make sense and Iâm sorry if you believe that line you are deluded, if it truly were a 'reward' for loyal fans (and not simply an attempt to take advantage of the most loyal players) then why should this deal have an expiry date? Especially an expiry date before any details about the game were even released.I will wrap this review up I promise but I felt these issues were very important; and I should clarify there are some nice new additions like the new statistical analysis after every game and the improvements to the engine making it run faster as well as some other nice touches including improved/smoother UI and the new social feed but ultimately these are not really major changes especially when there are such major problems with key features such as the match engine. I really canât bring myself to recommend this game, originally this was simply down to my disappointment with the absurd player ai, particularly defensively which in no way represents real life. Now though I feel that I cannot recommend buying this game on account of Miles Jacobson's deceitful and exploitative behaviour.			"

												Probably the worst FM yet in my eyes. WAAAAAY too many games you are winning that end in defeats and the opposition seems to score with every shot/highlight. People will (I'm sure) say ""You're just bad"" but it is a nonsense that your players just throw the ball to the opposition on throw ins and you concede.Also, the fact the kick offs are only 1 man in the centre circle and that hasn't been patched is embarrassing, not to mention the goalkeepers who drop the ball behind them and then panic clear it to the opposition strikers. Does anybody test games before release these days?!			"

If you are a series pro or a new player i just want to warn you that this edition is very bad. Completly random match engine, tactics and player form have no effect, tons of bugs. Don't celebrate if you are winning 7-0 at half time at home against a non league club who have had 8 players sent off, you will lose the game. i have never witnessed such bizzare randomness in a statistic based game before. i understand that football is unpredictable but it still has to adhere to the laws of physics, it does not in this game. So very, very bad.Can not recommend, yet will play it forever........ help me			"

You're playing well, 2nd in the league, full of confidence and come up the team that is second bottom who have won 1 game in 10 and surprisingly when they play you, they've turned into Barcelona and smash you 3-0.

If i could get my money back i would. Id expect these games to get better but this is a massive dissapointment!!!!			"

												Only in the beta stage but the decision making and player AI is even appalling the number of times players miss balls completely or playrs kick balls into the oppositions pass is ridiculous never had an oppopent make a single one of these dicussions making the problem more laughable. This completely spoils the game and needs addressing asap.Otherwise its a good game but transfer baragains a far and few between and transfer negotations are tough with players walking on one offer frequently.I've played the game since 2004 and so far this is a poor one.** Edit Some work has been made to address which is good but some of the the AI issues but still exist such as every cut back = a goal number of 35yd screamers.

												I was curios, so i bought this game to see what's new, i was dissapointed to find that it's exactly the same game, no new features, no fixes to FM16 bugs. It's just FM16 with new bugs.I thought they'll improve the game engine, i thought they'll add ""gegenpressing"" (PES17 did), i thought my strikers will help the midfielders when mentality is ""defensive"" (FIFA17 strikers do), i thought they'll add new instructions, they didn't.Performance on Macbook Pro still sucks, even if you use 2d with ""low graphics"", sure i could go to their community and submit a bug, but don't think i should, because that issue is from FM16, why would they fix it now?I found a match engine bug, went to their community and submitted a bug with PKMs, SI didn't respond yet, so i decided to go ahead and request a refund.The only ones who responded are the power hungry ""mods"" who complained that ""that's not enough PKMs"", â¥â¥â¥â¥ off.Tacitcally, you have more instructions in PES17, positionally this game sucks, players don't know where to stand and they need to add new instructions, but they'll probably won't, because why should they? do they have a competitor?I'm shocked and feel conned, SI needs a competitor, yesterday.

Yeah, right. I wouldn't mind if I conceded these goals if the opponent were much better. But when I have +-20 shots on goal and the opponent has 5 to 10, and they score every single time and I don't, it just starts to get onto my nerves.Fix. The. Match. Engine.			"

Try anything else, go back to 2011, go back to when CM/FM meant an enjoyable duel between AI and the manager. Don't waste your money on this garbage.Seriously upset about his game. Tactics are a joke, they don't change a thing. May as well stick with 4-4-2. Same goes with player roles, support, attack, defend, all are worthless. Played since the original and unless this garbage is seriously overhauled i' going back to a cm game where your tactics actually made a difference. It's a game where cosmetics has been pushed over actual playability and until this has been addressed it is not worth a free play let alone the huge price tag i've paid.			"

												(Firstly there may be one or two errors, I have copied and pasted my FM16 review, with a quick skim through of edits. (Yes, I have taken a Sports Interactive approach to reviewing)This review is based on being a FM/CM player for over 20 years and someone who only ever plays the full mode, not classic or touch.Firstly the big thumbs down is based on two reasons. One: A huge part of managment is the time between games, the training part of real managment is huge. Who is doing well, who isnt putting the effort in, who is fighting for a first team place. What bonds are being formed between the players ect. FM 17: Nothing.Two: Boardrooms. I only manage big clubs and big clubs in FM17 doesnt even slightly resemble the big clubs I read about in the papers or see on television.. There is no living world above the manager in FM17, just a bland, highly basic, simplistic UI that makes you feel like you are a manger of a non league club with pretty much total control.This year we have a simulated Brexit. Really?! Its like someone thought this up while they were sat on sofa infront of the news last year. All the things FM lacks and they put in a brexit. Honestly the direction this game has gone in the last few years is just baffaling.On the Sports Interactive FM forums there is a huge wishlist thread with over 6000 replies. Pick any random page and there are countless wishes for in-depth training, media pressure, player interaction, ME improvments, Board improvements. With the exception of the ME there has been no noticeable improvement in any of these over the last three years.The game is all to easy to create all conquering teams that win trophies year after year. In real life how many managers stay at the same club and keep constantly winning trophies? Obviously Sir Alex Ferguson and a few others, but it should be hard, really hard to do. Its just to easy in FM. How many young players who are deemed wonderkids in real life go on to actually become superstars? Not that many, a handful from each generation. Not so in FM, buy a wonderkid, play wonderkid, watch wonderkid fulfill potential. On the other hand, want to pluck a kid from the french second division who no one really rates and watch him suprise everyone (ala Marhez of Leicester), no chance. The constrictive CA/PA system wont allow that until a FM researcher updates it for you. The problem with this system is that Marhez is now a world beater because of one good season, in FM18 he will probably be mearly good, but in a save game which runs muliple years we have a situation where Marhez was awful in FM15/16, amazing in 17, yet neither is a true refelection of the dynamic evolution of a player which has peaks and troughs. Its a system that is showing its age and each player is a snapshot of a FM researchers opinion at a moment in time, but a snapshot that will be set in stone throughout a save game. They may have served the series well, but many of the systems FM17 incorporates are basic and easy to control because they havent moved forward in the last few years.Football Manager really hasnt moved forward with the times. 15 to 20 years ago a lot of managers did run the club from top to bottom but these days top, top clubs arent run like that. FM does a really poor job of reflecting this, sure there is the token Director of football, the token head of development, but again very simplistic, basic systems that just doesnt reflect top level football in 2017. Managing a top club in FM17 feels more like a quaint throwback to the 90s than an actual reflection of what fooball has become in the last 15 years. Adding a pretty basic social media UI isnt going to modernise anything in a meaningful way.3 years ago I thought FM was about where it should be. Now its coming across stale and out of ideas. Going by the wishlist thread in their own forums theres 100s of great ideas, but for whatever reason SI has entered the change UI, tag on some light weight features and sell for full price approach. Its sad to see. I will still play it, but every year its getting harder to justify paying Â£35 for a game that isnt moving forward and is no longer reflecting the sport I watch and read about. I will still rack up the hours, but more because there is no other game to buy than what SI have developed.The FM series needs a huge shake up. Whoever is choosing the directon of the game, what new features are going in ect needs to be moved on. Every year real life football grows, the juggernaught keeps getting bigger and expanding. Every year that goes by where we have new features like create a club and fantasy draft is another year where FM loses ground on the sport its trying to represent. Its sad that the people in control of the games direction have completely lost sight of what gave the game its cult following. It got the basics of the football world right and let the players imagination fill in the gaps and build from there. The basics of the FM world dont feel right anymore. Without that basic foundation the imagination has no support, FM needs imagination to work or it is just a game and FM was never just a game.			"

												This is the first time i have reviewed a game. (its that bad)  I have always bought this year in year out and its going downhill. To be fair i love the database and not that fussed about the small changes compared to 2016. I would buy the game just for the data update, Which i do.On previous games i have spent hours enjoying a saved game. I even spent hours on 2016 and thematch engine wasnt the best on that.But wow this years 3d match engine is the worst iv seen, It makes the game umplayable. I redownloaded FM13 to test the game and how bad the games become. I dont know about anyone else but i loved FM13 Match engine, Players would actually dribble, Pass and shoot properly. Unlike this year. The players are all over. The engine is broke. Its easy to blame tactics ect... but no iv always been decent at the game and i still am this year. I am winning my matches but its boring! Players shoot in the side netting all the time, The keepers are iver amazing or dreadful thiers no inbetween. Iv had my keeper run out of net and they score a open goal.  Players always look sluggish, the dribbling is terrible, they just run, stop turn and pass or shoot miles away from goal. Which takes me to long shots, Fair enough the odd time, but wow even when my tactics are set to work ball into box and the players are set to not shoot from distance it dont matter. They just shoot from anywere. The defending is shocking, Freekicks are the same were they iver get blasted against the wall or wide, with the very rare goal. Like i said this is my 1st review so sorry if its not like others or not into better detail. I read the reviews before i bought the game but one of the stupid ones that buy it anyways every year. If you havnt bought it, Please dont. Everyone is complaining how little changes have been made, I think its worse. Might only be the match engine but thats the whole point of playing the game! I wont be getting next years unless most people have recomended it.			"

												The new features in this year's game are slender at best, they've still not sufficiently improved the terrible 3D match engine, and every single tactic will be figured out by the AI in about two minutes. Still a very good game, but only for big fans of the series as it does little to progress the format. People new to Football Manager, wait until next year.			"

												A really bad game. I feel I've been let down again this year by Sports Interactive. The game is almost no different from FM16 and it has exactly the same issues. After I've played with both PSG and Man Utd, and tried several tactics and philisophies and the players still underperform, I've chosen to stop playing the game. With players like: Hazard, Griezmann, Cavani, DembÃ©lÃ©, Verratti, Marquinhos, Laporte and so on, and still losing 3-1 to teams like Nimes and Troyes and not being able to qualify in the Champions Cup, I've discovered that the players don't listen to your tactics and instructions. It doesn't matter what tactics or instructions you give the players or teamtalk, you will still get bad results against bad teams. For 55â¬ i will not be recommending this game			"

												Well, there ARE new things in the game as far as management goes: -Some new lines from the media (but still poor)-slightly revamped interface (not really new, since this is done every year)-new staff roles (analyst/ sport scientist), which I find cool-Stats are actually explained (woohoo, took us some time to get there, didn't it?)-Overall more info is given about the game through the help system, which new players will appreacite. I remember the first time I picked FM up (and dropped it shortly after before coming back) the game was very confusing and seemed like a vast amount of information that you need to get familliar with and don't understand anything at first. This IS important for new players, as it is important that people understand how to play this game.  Otherwise they won't bother, because it is rather difficult, not least because it used to be very confusing at times. But, of course, for those who have several thousand hours on FM, it is of no use.-social feed, which I know many people love (it is amusing, but, as pretty much everything else, it suffers from the lack of diversity i.e. it gets repetitive and the creative resource gets exhausted quickly).-The way you receive pretty much all your informtion in the game has been slightly altered. You've got a breakdown on every aspect of the club and status of the players in a box, which is presented to you by various staff members, like your assistant for example, for time to time (as per your instructions, apparently). Inside in the very same box, you've got the ability to apply the advice given by the staff member, individually or wholly using the ""apply all"" button. If you don't like to manage the club yourself, now managing the club is easier than ever before. The game sort of holds your hand through the staff members of your club to  a much bigger extent than in the previous versions of the game. The process of managing the players has become more streamlined. Not really helpful for myself, though.-Finally, there are more options for analysis, which is always great.As for the match engine...Well I have noticed four differences between '17 and '16 versions:- the pre-match activity of the players (as in the description, but it is very brief and, once again, REPETITIVE).-the vanishing aka ""magic"" spray is finally at the referee's disposal (this game finds it hard to follow the latest trends in the real life, doesn't it?)-it is now possible to view the match from behind the goal and corner spots.-the interactive billboards are now electronic (oh yeah, we got there!) and show genuine ads (like advertising beats by Dre - I am not kidding!). So they not only advertise their stuff anymore (I mean content made by SI and harmless social advertising related to football, with a little bit of SEGA every here and there), but they endorse products and services for which they are paid, therefore engaging in economic activity. Not a big deal, but I find it gross, especially given how expensive their game became. There should be a way to turn this off in the settings, imho.That's pretty much it. The range of motion of the AI involved in the game has become a tiny bit wider, but no new animations were spotted by me. I always check both high profile matches and very low divisions in hopes of finding somethnig exciting. Not this time!I want to say the match engine remained largely the same as last year, but I can't...because the ME remained EXACTLY the same as last year.All in all I do not recommend this game for its full price. While it is discounted, those who want to pick this franchise for the first time and those coming from FM 2015 and earlier can get a good deal. Why I don't recommend this game?Because THERE IS NO FRIGGIN' REASON WHY THE CHANGES WE GOT IN THIS VERSION COULD NOT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED EARLIER, IN FM 2016 FOR EXAMPLE! Some of these changes are long overdue and should have been made somewhat earlier. With that, the game still holds its flaws, some of which come from 7 years ago. Only now you are NOT able to see how skilled a player is with his feet without doing some scouting. I always found it weird how you know right off the bat a player's preferred foot and how strong his weaker foot is even if you know nothing at all about the player. There is no reason why things like these can't be fixed and polished in one big batch (or a patch?) in a SINGLE iteration of FM. SI nowadays is like Apple - plan two years in advance, but release only planned ""innovations"" in portions as small as possible.FM definitely needs a competitor in the market. The slackers at SI are not so poor anymore after charging â¬55 for their football version of COD, so there is no excuse for them now.  Not worth the 55 quid. I, myself, am not buying this game and sticking with FM 2016, which is good in my opinion. FM 2017 is not good or bad compared with FM 2016, but that is the point - why even bother? Yes, the changes are nice, I liked some of them, but I guess i'll be getting them with FM 2018 along with other new stuff (if there will be any).			"

												I'm pretty tired of people moaning about this game. This game, is, by far, the most in depth and detailed football game you're ever going to get.The match engine isn't as bad as people make out. Yes, there are some glitches, yes it requires some patch updates, But most games do these days. This is the route ALL NEW GAMES go down now. Look at Xbox games, constantly adding updates to them now. PC Games have always had patches added to them and, this game has been the most ambitious of them all because of the political changes surrounding Brexit that would have needed to be made. I'll come back to that later. Speaking as someone who has worked in computer programming, you can guarantee that any other game that now is part of a console that connects to the internet will be sliding small glitch and bug fixes into their patch updates. I also hear people complain about either being too many changes or not enough changes. Its ridiculous. the game is adaptive, works better, is more personable to the players and all round, is more difficult to play than ever, which at the end of the day, i'd rather not be sat here winning league after leage while finding the game ridiculously easy. If you want to play a game where you win game in, game out, go play FIFA 2017's career mode and just play the games yourself.I find the game good fun, enough to write this review, because people will buy the game, play it, lose a few matches or find it difficult, or get a slight glitch, and boom, straight on the review pages slating it.....Please click my review to see more of my rant...The game is very realistic. Whenever i discuss it with people who don't play the game, they are pretty surprised by the lengths that the game has gone to take what goes on in real life and put it into the game. Again, its obvious you will not see Wayne Rooneys taste for the elder ladies come into fruition, Cristiano Ronaldo is not gonna write off his ferarri on his way to training. Big Sam will not be caught with his pants down over circumventing the third party ownership laws and of course there won't be a massive scandal over the head of Fifa taking bungs left right and centre because THATS NOT WHAT THE GAMES ABOUT! you just won't see that in any game!The crowning glory for me in terms of the new additions is the Brexit. The fact that you can start any new game you want and it will be completely different from the next because of this. It is like Russian roulette of Footballing geography. The fact they managed to turn this around so quickly into probably one of the best additions of the game is unbelievable. YOU WILL NOT GET THIS IN ANY OTHER GAME!Yes, there are alot of the same old same olds, but, its a football management game. I'm pretty sure there's only a finite number of things you can do when you break it down. I don't get what people want out of the game when they say this.The only things i've noticed that have swayed from the realism is team names and the German national team situation.  It seems like that is the only thing that has gotten worse from previous years. There are no Brazillian team names any more, or spanish. You can work it out, but they are named differently for some reason. That is a negative.As far as managing the team, playing through the matches, moving up the leagues, winning games, losing games, buying/selling/dealing with/training players, even the realism of transfer fees and the finances going on in the game and the influence of the Chinese leagues are concerned.. this is second to no other football management simulation game. Fact.So stop moaning about not being able to win games, that one glitch that cost you a goal, that you hammer teams statistically but can't score for toffee, or even that the came crashed one time and you were on a good run (USE THE â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ SAVE BUTTON AND AUTO SAVE OPTIONS!), about the bug fixes that come out (which FYI, auto download through steam and other than the january transfer updates move seamlessly into your save games),  about the gameplay (because that has actually improved alot over the years) and realise that this game is still the number 1 in football management simulators. All of them things can boil down to the work arounds i've already provided above or one simple thing.... BE A BETTER MANAGER!if i could give this game a star rating i'd say 4 out of 5. Aside from the club names and German national team situation, the only other thing that irks me slightly is the Sports scientist and data analyst roles and that there is currently no stats for them that make them any better or worse than anyone else. of course this is just my opinion, but i think you'll find its more detailed than the hundreds of othersthat say ' Games bad,' 'same old same old,' ' waste of money because it doesn't work properly' Anyone who says that this game is the same as the last one, is blind to the fact that thats the way it is now. i think if you look at the majority of games that release new versions every year, you'll find, there aren't any that really overhaul the game and come up with something brand spanking new. This game is trying to get as close to something in real life as it can. There is only so far it can go! if you find it too similar, step outside, take in a big deep breath and look around at yourself. life rarely changes!The game works fine for the most part, its the people operating the machines, or the machines themselves that don't work. Like i said, i'm aware that there are some crashes, some bug fixes... but ultimately, everything that you need to provide back up for all that is in the auto save. Maximum you will lose is a month if you actually bother to go to the preferences and set it up. Don't hate the game, hate the players (and after reading these negative reviews for the last 4/5 years... i actually have started to)			"

												WOW! I can't believe how bad this game is, I have played every version of this series since the Championship manager 97/98 version, most were ok, kept me engaged for months of my life, but this, it is so bad, in my current save I'm playing with a 4-3-3 narrow formation, no jokes on average I create 30  + chances a match with the match stat showing between 3 and 6 clear cut chances, but I am only scoring a goal every 3 games if I am lucky, at the moment I have 6 good strikers and between them they have scored 6 goals in 18 games with a shot on target ratio of about 16 percent most shots float over the bar like the ball has wings and when one of the strikers do hit it on target every goalkeeper in the game except mine of course makes manuel neuer look like an amatuer, wish I had never bought this utter garbage			"

												Poor game when it comes to putting your tactics in place.  Your players simply don'tlisten and you end up watching mostof the game seeing your players pitifully chase the opposition.Incredibly annoying and confusing as you can't really put your philososphies in place.  For example, my philosophy was to play direct football whilst closing opposition down immediately.  Also I attempt to have my midfielders involved however they are continuously overrun.  If your tactics don't work you know about it.  I've losta fair number of games so far with 8-0 a common score.Dont bother buying unless you like losing.

												Been playing this game continuously from FM 2008. I have also played Championship Manager 99/00. I don't recommend buying this game, there just simply aren't enough new features to warrant purchasing it. This series has been getting like Fifa has now for the last few years. It's just rehashed and put out there. PLUS there is a huge bug that I didn't realise has not been fixed for years, but I have just experienced for myself. All my player and manager history has disappeared from when I started the game. I looked online and players have been experiencing this for years. So no stats at all shown...This is simply put really bad and a load of crap!! Last Football Manager that I will ever play. Luckily I didn't pay for my copy as it was a Xmas gift, but I'm still disappointed with this game and SI.			"

												It's honestly the most annoying FM ever! I play with my favorite team Feyenoord when this happens. In the beginning of the season, my team is able to win almost every match (lost 2 matches of the first 17 in the competition). After the winterbreak my team is struggling. It's harder to win. You can say, your opponent is changing his tactics on your style of play. But then I start testing the same match 3(!) times with 3 different tactics. I did this in the match FC Twente - Feyenoord. I'm 1-2 up in the 89th minute. Somehow, Twente get a corner. The ball comes to my defender and he wants to clear the ball. However, he shot at the striker of my opponent and the ball bounces back to my keeper. He can easily pick the ball up, but he managed to dive OVER the ball. 2-2. 1 minute later: Free kick from 30 yards out fly in to the top corner. I Lost 3-2.I tried this game 2 times again and the same stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥ goals happen. My team is stronger 9 of 10 times, and have much more possesion, much more chanches and much, very much more shots, but the keepers of my opponents are like an octopus.

												I downloaded this game with a sense of hope. 10 hours into the game, the reviews proved to be true. Based on my first run in, I find the game to be poorly designed or shall i say, a distinct lack of improvement over the past few years. The match engine continues to be broken. The number of shots per game is unrealistically high. There often are at least 20 shots per game from one side. Talented youth players will go for 40 to 100 times of their market value hence making it quite impossible to buy them on a limited budgeted. This is based on 10 hours of game play where 2-3 hours was spent on setting up my squad. I have asked for a refund and i hope i will be reimbursed for my time wasted else just what i paid for the game.			"

												I've bit the bait and bought this version of marvelous franchise that I have been playing since like 20 years (with previous versions considered) with %50 discount, but I sincerely can't remember how I felt so annoyed and dismayed while playing past versions. Sure, I've had ups-and-downs throughout my gameplays, to be honest, I would consider myself as a decent player, learned to let failures and frustrations sink in, notwithstanding of this fact, I really hated this one. I totally agree with reviews, mostly laying emphasis on the negligence and laxness of devs that never cared to make even simple improvements from last years' versions. It's outrageous to disregard, and disparage at some point, even simple demands of such potent fanbase and I would like to say they were not demanding that much. I've felt my tactics would not even affect the outcome in any case, whereas they expect me to spare my limited free time to work my â¥â¥â¥ off and spend hours to cope with preposterous AI. I know it takes devotion, character and intensity (Brendan Rodgers much? :) to create a persistently performing team, but how can you expect me to thrive in such conditions, that your team concede in almost exact same fashion in every single game (Closing down through whole pitch, pinpointing shooters who would cause trouble and closing them down specifically, higher defence line or retracting deep into own 6 yard box...nah, none of them works!) , or players would not even care to apply the instructions that given to them and act on the contrary of them? I don't even bother to continue playing this game anymore so I hope this review might shed a light on other fellow players who would consider buying it....			"

												This very game is getting more and more ridiculous now, I've had million injuries before the season even begins, bravo____________________edit in Feb 16th,2017This is the end of all Football Manager series. Football-wise, I had the worst experience of all FM generations from CM0102 till now. Teams become uncoachable. It's full of ridiculous mistakes, miss interceptions, misplaced crosses, unneccesary dribbles that any sane player would not do. I've tuned my tatics with great care, read scout report throughly and it makes no difference. I will not buy any FM again.			"

												I can't tell how much I love this game. the whole experience is unique and one of a kind, but what makes me absolutely furious is the fact that the annimations are the same since I started playing this game back in 09 and maybe even before that, since FM 2014 and I feel like I am purchasing the same game every year all over again plus the new transfers, which you can do with a patch, I know they add cool stuff every year and I appreciate that, but it's just not enough, the number one thing people seek for in this game is reality, and graphics should be priority not social nework feed... I am for sure gonna think twice before buying FM in the future, unless it has some real graphics changes.			"

												There are so many issues withthis game but the most annoying is one that has reared its ugly head so many times down the years.I seem to average 25-30 shots every match!?!? However I do not score-oh no but my opponents seem too! In my last game I had 37 shots-25 on target and scored once. My opposition? 6 shots, 5 on target scoring 4!!!This pretty much happens every match I play-utterly ridiculous especially when my attacking stats are strong for the division I am playing in. Oh-And my gaolkeeper is pretty sorted too! "

												I have played football manager series since fm 2005. Honestly i have been very patient when things go bad, cause eventually maybe after a few weeks, maybe months things would start to turn in your favor as you try different approaches in tactics, tweaks in your instructions etc.This year i have ran out of patience.AI decides whether it likes your tactics, playstyle during game and comes with a conclusion of the game at the end. But, and there is a big but here, the way its carried out through match is purely STUPID. For instance, you had a bad start conceding very early and trailing by 1. Now, if you haven't conceded again within next 10 minutes from your opponent left/right back's crossing you think you are lucky. But you don't get away with it. The ball approaches towards your right back with excellent stats, however he literally avoids the ball by running backwards instead of simply standing there, getting the ball and clearing it from the danger. Result? Opponents left winger gets the ball, your right back pretends to defend by escorting him all the way to six-yard and opponent scores.I have watched it over and over and came to conclusion that this game has no point. Things just arbitrarily happen and doesn't make any sense and i should stop wasting any time on it. Fix your freaking game SI and actually make some changes to game that are useful and improve user's experience. The only reason i bothered to write this review is i'm mad and i don't wany anyone else to get mad in case they consider to buy this crap.			"

												431 hours in FM17. +15k hours total in FMIf you love mangement games, yeah sure FM overall is the best game out there if you ask me. But if you allready got FM16, you got the best manager game on the market. I do not care, if I need to wait years for a better match engine, and graphcis overall. I do not care if the game is 50gb or even 100gb instead of 5gb, I dont care to wait for bug fixes, and it may be pushed a few months back in realse date, JUST DO IT, becourse I love the game, but FM17 will make me think more then twice on a buy of FM18.

												I am not a loyal FM fan, bought the game simply because I like strategy games. So far my experience is not what I would expect from a PC FM game. 1. the splash screen are 4:3 scale, we are in 2016/7 and I was astonished when I saw the 2 dark areas at the sides of my screen, fearing I bought some game made in the 90's. 2. no music/SFX in the menu. I only have a low-priced headset and all I can hear during the game is the buzzing. Again we are in 2016/7, we no longer need to try to put everything in a 32kb disk. Even if you just put in one 8-bit BGM, it would make me feel much better.3. terrible optimization. The game's UI makes it feel like a web game, but the loading tme feels like a 90 GB triple A game running on a 00's PC.4. terrible art choice. Why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ does my manager have such long arms and such terrible looking suits? Come on SEGA you were from Japan, even just grabbing some 2D portraits would make the manager look much better. The unpolished 3D model which lack detailed customization only make things worse and  make the game even more feel like a terrible web game.5. as every Chinese player ponted out in there review, the producer promised Chinese, the game supported 16 languages, the game itself has Chinese football league, yet there is no official Chinese translation. I have no difficulty reading English, but trying to read those not-mother-language small characters on a 15 inch screen is really pain in the â¥â¥â¥. This is not simply a matter of not supporting the majority of the purchaser of the game, but exposing the problem of discrimination and dishonesty.I have to admit that the core game mechanics are fascinating, but these surface level problems are hindering me from enjoying those juicy core contents. When small problems gather, a nonnegligible situation appears, an thus a not recommanded is given. 49/100 slightly not recommanded.			"

												A small briefing here. I've begun to play FM since CM 2000-2001. I am a huge fan of the series. Every newer version since CM 2000-2001 was a bit better than the previous one. Until reaching now FM 2017... I'm in the difficult position to announce that Football Manager 2017 is easily the worst manager ever. So here are some pros & cons that i've encountered already in this year's version:Pros:+ graphics are great.+ it's been very helpfull that green board who keep suggesting you things. [it's been since 2016 but whatever]+ some details are also helpful and comfy.Cons:- this is a huge ball breaker. if a player receives an interest from any club regardless if their contracts are ending in a long time then demands new contract, if a contract not served, then uprises making the whole team into pieces. Imagine that in a  very larger scale than one player. And If any of you ask me how much i have  in discipline it's 20. - players uprises randomly demanding improved contracts to reflect their importance to the team regardless if their contracts are ending in a very long time or if they are only in the team for a year. - playing against minor teams i might lose 4-0 or 5-1 and against bigger teams i might win them 4-0. This usually happens. [it's been in the last Fm editions but whatever]- i cannot make an instant request from the board the first year of my contract. Why this had to change?- too much talking even for minor issues.- AI is heavily stupid. I was doing the registration for the Europa League, as the most of us know the Under-21 players don't need to register but once i'm finishing the registration there was a player that his age is 19 years old so i didn't register him  and he was upset why i haven't register him. And there's more than that. just finished with my registration and two players the one that i've been talking earlier about a second one that he is 17 years old both i did left them unregistered fm shows me that i cannot use them. I mean WTF?Putting all the minors together you don't have time for the actuall game but instead you focus on past these craps;So i certainly won't recommend this game. I'd put a 3-4/10			"

												Football Manager has been made great again. Because Football Manager is fun again.The goodSome of the ""modern"" aspects of the game have been scraped away (mainly the psychological management) in favor of 2012-like more balanced system.Instructions you give to players finally make a difference. Since dropping the sliders in favor of roles & instructions, it was very frustrating to have your team play the same every single game, no matter what you say. NO MORE! It's not 100% perfect, but it's much much better.AI transfer policies seem better and random highly unlikely things (1 year injuries) aren't common any more.The badPress conferences are still bland af. Everything present was in 2011.There isn't much pressure to make your tactics detailed. You can live with default settings and adjusting roles.Player search results aren't cached, so when you want to go through a list by looking at player profiles, every time you press back, it has to re-process.The uglyMost criticism in Steam reviews is about lack of Chinese language and unrealistic match simulations. I can't/don't want to comment on the first point, but it's kinda unbelievable people still expect *realistic* matches. Sure, every year SI says it's going to be realistic, but come on! There was never a realistic CM/FM game and it won't be in forseeable future. It's, at least, fun again.OverallFM17 is a well-rounded game, unlike last editions. People who criticise the game about its gameplay are probably oversaturnated. This franchise is evolutionary by a for-profit company, not revolutionary. It's basically *only* an improved older version. If improved isn't good enough for you because you've played enough of 14/15/16, you're gonna be frustrated. If it is, ignore the mixed reviews and buy it.			"

The ME has not progressed or become any better at all. The devs keep on adding features that really not affecting the gameplay, and just become useless spam. It would not have been tolerated in other AAA strategy games. It seems they are only focusing on the 3D rendering. The players are lining up before the game, just another thing to skip after seen it once. The 3D rendering has become slightly better for those who appreciate that "

												I could say that I'm a true Football-Manager fan. I'm playing the game for 10 years now and it's a game who's always on my 'to-buy' list. The only problem in this game is: The game is already so detailled, it's almost impossible to add things that are really an addition to this game. I love the way they improve the graphics, interface and extra-options in the game like creating your own manager for example. Everytime they add some more tactic-options aswell which makes your team completely the way you want it to play. When you switch some tactics it's really rewarding to see your team really changing the way of approaching a match, and it's even more rewarding when it's really working out!On the other side, they could really improve the Social Media and the Press conference options. You're always facing the same questions and comments. That's the reason I let my assistent-manager do those things, because it got me bored already. Resume:Gameplay:      9/10: It's really addictive, especially when u'r playing with your favourite teams or climbing up from the bottom.Replay value: 10/10: Because you can almost play like every club on the world, it is really awesome to try other tactics with the same squad, or become manager on the other side of the world. Graphics:        7/10: Because i'm playing for around 10 years, I really see the improvements they are working through. But ofcourse, it can only get better.Price/Worth    7/10: â¬54,99 is a lot of money for a game. But I play this game so much every year, it's really worth it for me. Total: 8/10. "

It is very slow !!!So, if u play only in multiplayer mode (like me), do not buy it!! keep playin fm16.In addition, sometimes I get dumbs during the game. There is another thing that I cannot understand how the producers decided to launch the game (which is not working properly) to the market.It is totaly, wasting a money!!			"

												The only reason I would consider buying it after playing it for the free weekend is finally my team everton have some cash and the chance at a new stadium. Add to that they have the official names faces and badge and I might have bought it. I love Football manager just not this one. It's buggy and inconsistant. Players have zero decision making skills and all teams play the same way like they are barca. The players ignore all the tactical changes you make and just do what they want.Side note I actually comented on the facebook page for this game with the issues the game has.They responded by posting some snide comments that had no relation to the issues I had. They know the game is broken but as long as they get your cash they don't care.			"

												I have over 700 hours in this years edition and have to say that beyond a few cosmetic changes and tweeks to the match engine(for the worse), this game is significanlty worse than FM16(1700+ hours clocked). The tacked on social network aspect is appallingly bad and only serves slows the game down, the create a face feature seems like the owners saw a good sales pitch and decided to tack it on and the AI/Match engine is all over the place at best. FM16 has it's flaws but is infintely more playable than FM17. As of today I will be going back to FM16 full time, I played a few hours last night and the game flies by at breakneck speed and seems fresh an clean without the token social network attached.			"

												!Disclaimer! I played this during the recent (24th through to 26th March 2017) free play weekend. I can honestly say that the majorty of people are correct in their reviews, basically you can boss the game and still lose 2-0 to a relegation battling side this isn't just a one off rage quit, this actually happens quite often. There is now live adverts on the stands for actual products, wtf? Goalkeepers are proper broken and players appear dumb (they run to the ball with the ability to get there first but slow right down so the opponent can get there and 90% of the time get the first touch). Apart from the database update (which honestly could be done with a simple patch but..money..) and some minor things it is very much the same game, this is becoming a lot like FIFA (read: same â¥â¥â¥â¥ different year).I think if anything the free weekend has convinced many people that may have been on the fence to not purchase rather than the oposite as I imagine was intended, and the thing is even though SI have had a LOT of feedback it appears none of it has been listened to and the dev's are just becoming another EA (selling out to have real adverts in the game) and watching their bank account.tl;drI wouldn't buy this game for even a pound let alone what it is now, AI (especially goalkeepers) is broken and very very little improvement to the match engine/animations. Avoid at all costs and this is a shambles and SI don't appear to give a damn about what their fans think. Hopefully people will start voting with their money so that the company actually decides to put some effort in rather than copy paste the same code from last year with minor tweaks and call it a full game.

												2 games into the season, 2 games lost: 2 indirect red cards despite the fact that none of my players has an aggressive instruction, 1 own goal in injury time all the while I have 5 clear cut chances  (vs 1 for the opposing teams),  6 shots against post/crossbar and ridiculous saves from both opposing gk. This engine is just a complete mess.Edit: as I never really played with one of the top teams I decided to start with Barcelona for a change. I'm in November and what I suspected is simply becoming the truth, you can have the best players in the world and it makes no difference. Messi, despite taking all free kicks, managed 1 goal from a freekick and puts about 1 in ten on target. Most of them either go in the wall or over. There's an insane amount of blocked shots and an insane amount of shots going wide (this is nothing new btw it's been in the game for years). If three of the world's best strikers fail to get a shot on target from within the box there's clearly something wrong there.  Three of my conceded goals happened because my last defender decided to just stand there with the ball till the opposing attacker took it off him and scored. To illustrate this, and mind you this is not the only game this happened just the most extreme example, I give you the stats of my game against leganes which ended in a narrow one-nil victory: 47 shots on goal, 22 corners and five clear cut chances. Their, injured, goalie made 12 saves and got a 6.8 (!) rating. The tactic doesn't call for long shots or taking shots whenever they can yet Messi only put 2 out of his 9 shots on target (and missed a penalty), Alcacer 1 in 6, Iniesta 4 in 11 and Rakitic 4 in 14. Now in what world is this still a sim?			"

SO comes to closed season and i had like 100mill to spend brought 4/5 players in 2 of which were world class and 3 promising players...i sold...lingard,darmian,rooney and blind for decent money...so i started the second season with a better squad 2 class players per position...tactics rolling class again in pre season...i start the season with 5 losses out of 6...3 of the teams were promoted from the championship with no investment of there squads!!...and i had 5 red cards in them 6 games ...2 of which were in one game before half time!! i would go 1-0 or 2-0 up and just fall apart..i would have like 30 shots on goal and 4 on target 65% of the ball and they would score on the first shot on target at 75mins!! i didnt have 1 red card last season...and now i have 5.I then have about 10 injuries to the first team 5 in the middle of midfield all happened in the last 2 weeks of pre season..last year i had one or 2 injuries how can that change so much?!!! ibra scored 46 goals last season hes played 9 and scored 1! the game is a joke! over priced bag of rubbish! none of this is realistic at all.....i for one am not the best Fm player by a mile and dont mind losing but not like that with Man Utd and Squad of World class players who won 3 Tophies last season!

												This is a very frustrating game, there are very few issues with the game play, in fact in terms of game play I would say that this is one of the best FM games in recent years. My issue is that around 60%-70% of the games crash (I have had to play a game three times). The big issue is that I played a game was winning on three occasions and the game kept crashing, on the fourth attempt I lost the match.

												First of all I don't agree with the vast majority that say that this game is worse than last year!Is this the best game they made until now? For me it isn't, the best one for me was FM2012, with 2015 close by. However they made some slight improvements to the match engine in this one and they update how some B teams work in the leagues that have this system and that is way better than the way it was on FM2016 were you will never use your B teams, because they were usuless. Is it still worth it buying it? Yes I would say so since I found 2016 the most boring game they made because the match engine was completly broken, and in that way didn't allow you to enjoy the game. Is this game worth full price? No I don't think so and I bought it outside of steam for a cheaper price, otherwise I would not be playing it. But I do recommend it when the game hits a sale of at least 50%. And because of this I will give it a positive review, and because I think it improved in relation to FM2016.			"

												I like the few changes that are made in the menu's and how FM presents information. There are much statistics and pre- and post game information that makes you feel that you can actually impact what happens on the pitch; However, that feeling is brutally killed by the match engine. I don't mind the graphics being so poor that it looks like a game from 2009 or the goalkeepers being â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, but I do mind that feeling of the game's outcome being pre- decided (most often not in your favor). And no matter what you do, or whitch tactics you choose, I never get the feeling that I'm actually changing anything or giving my team better chances. I've experimented and tried various tactics and approaches, but I still feel like an observer to my own funeral, with nothing to say, or do, to impact the outcome. I don't mind losing, but at least show me why I'm losing. Instead of my team hitting the post four times and missing a penalty, and then conceding in the 80th minute on the first half chance the opposition gets, five matches in a row!			"

												This game feels like the developers have just watched the excellent Trading Places and said, ""Wouldn't it be great if we Louis (Dan Aykroyd) the managers, you know, just for a laugh? But keep turning the screw until it breaks.""It seems to defeat the enjoyment to be had in playing strategy/management type games, of meeting challenges, learning to cope and turn events around to hopefully win, when the AI decides to take over and throw all your carefully crafted work out the window for the rest of a season. You're no longer in charge, and the game is no longer a game but a series of disheartening events.Welcome to Football Manager 2017			"

												FM 2017 is essentially FM 2016 with a minor change of number in the title (the number ""6"" at the end of the game's title has been replaced by a ""7"") except for the fact that it has also become worse than its predecessor. Far too much priority was spent on including pointless features rather than improving the clear, obvious issues that FM gamers have been ranting about for the past few years. For instance, world class footballers continue to blast the ball over the bar from six yards out 15 times a match, and opposition players manage to score goals from tight angles by crossing the ball and it taking a deflection off of thin air and bouncing past a goalkeeper that looks like he has consumed a barrel of beer and been blindfolded, just for the commentary to cry, ""What a goal! He certainly didn't mean that!"" Well no, he certainly did not mean for his cross to strike a slab of dark matter floating inside of the six yard box which bounced the ball past the goalkeeper. Not even the laws of astrophysics meant for that to happen. But nevermind that, there is a new social media feature in the game! And the boring, repetitive post-match interviews which have been unchanged from FM 1826 are still there to be replied to! Anyway, FM itself is still amazing and the love of my life (sort of), but these issues demand ranting after so much money has been spent on the game. And despite all this ranting, I am going to continue smashing the game away!			"

												Basically you pay for a glorified data update, rather than getting a new game - this has been going on for the last 3-4 games. On top of that, this years installment has WAY too many bugs, and sloppy execution of graphics. Game generated players (regens) look more like aliens than humans. We are in the year of 2017 and the graphics of this game (specially the regens) look like something out of a 2001 game. Embarrasing to release something like this. The way the staff acts on their forums when bugs are raised, just makes things so much worse. In stead of collaborating with their fans, they acts as if we are the ones owing them something, as if we didn't pay 40-50â¬ for this game, but the other way around. After having bought the CM/FM franchise every year since CM Italia, never again am i gonna support such an amateurish dev team.			"

If you report (taking another's case) that you as Tottenham managed to beat Arsenal 10-0 in a normal league match 3 years in, the moderator will reject the case stateting that ""3 years in, everything can happen"". As soon as the author posts back that Arsenal finished over Tottenham the past 2 season he just don't respond back.Another case, a manager managing Frankfurt wins massive games and just roll over Bayern Munich massively. Still not accepting this to be a issue..The goalkeepers are acting weird and so are the defenders. Lets take one last example from my own game.I have a DL about to clear a ball (all alone), he somehow manage to pass it back to goalkeeper eventhough it would be more realistic for him to run and play the ball up the field of clear out to throwin. He pass the ball back and the goalkeeper wont take the ball with the hands and just walks to it, and let it pass under him resulting in a own goal. I mean, WTF right?.. Well the goalkeeper gets a massive score drop (from 8 -> 5) and the DL gains score after that, and the DL is credited as own goal.After that indident I have a poor keeper in score with low selfeseem infront after 60 mins of play with 5-1 and end up losing 5-7 to a team in the bottom with only a few points.The game is broken, their support is non-existance and considering they haven't even started working on the patch we can expect this game to be broken for a while.I can't believe how poor i feel about this game. FM2016 was so perfect, and yet FM2017 is so far away from perfection as possible.DO NOT BUY AND SUPPORT SEGA - BUY FM16 INSTEAD!YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!			"

												So far playability is great, love some of the new features and the flow. My main concern is the limited ability to find players, the players I know exist but don't appear in the game.  I am checking it isn't the way I've set up but so far I am very disappointed with the lack of ability to search for the next starlet as they do not appear, the inability to access leagues and nations to find and view players.The usual list of Wonder KIds I have from FM16 and from the forums, vast majority don't appear in the game play.Massive disappointment so far!!!

												UPDATE: Looks like they broke even x.3 rule. 17.3 patch is totally unplayable - ten times slower (not an exaggeration!), crashes at certaing points of a save so you can't advance, and EVEN MORE UGLIER regen faces (didn't think it's possible).So, ""NO"" stays. Not worth buying....Actually it's nothing to review except reviews, just want to remind one simple thing:If you don't feel like working as beta-tester for free, don't play seriously until winter transfers update (17.3) is released. Everything before is just a public beta. It always was, since the beginning.I'm not recommending the game right now, mostly 'cause of ""yes/no"" limitations. I'll recommend it somewhere in Feb 2017.			"

												I think I should preface my review by stating I am a long time FM (and CM) player with well over 10,000 hours logged since my first game back in 1998. To get the nice words out of the way, FM17 looks very nice. Social feed clogs everything up but on the whole, a nice visual change (albeit small) from 16. Matchday looks good so no complaints there. And now onto the bad. I remember reading a review from earlier which stated that FM17 had embraced this identity of a get the slightest thing wrong (team-talk, group meeting, flexibility etc etc) and you will get absolutely pasted and to a certain extent, that summation is correct. Since about '14 we have seen this to be more and more accurate. But for such a framework to exist, there HAS to be some kind of continuity with which things like team-talks & formations work. Team-talks are easiest to focus in this example. Game A, your team talk makes your players focused and they dominate the game and win. Game B, similar opposition, players are focused and you get pasted 5-0. There is absolutely 0 feedback to tell you what you are doing is correct because there is no continuity to assure you.Then we move onto discipline, penalties and injuries. You will rarely see the AI give away a penalty, get injured or get red-carded. You can be sure that your team will get 1, 2 or even all 3 happen to you in one game.It feels like SI have gone out of their way to make the game difficult which is all well and good. But they have gone beyond difficult and created a system which NO-ONE understands. The best analogy I can come up with to represent this is this. If I put my hand in fire, it hurts. I know not to put my hand in fire. I learn. Whereas the SI approach dictates that sometimes you can put your hand in fire and win a new car. Other times you 'might' get hurt. There is ZERO system in place to help you learn. All you can do is guess. Very, very disappointing and very, very boring. Poor show SI. Poor show.			"

												I buy FM every couple of years in the hope that some key aspects of the game that calls itself a simulation will be fixed. In 2017 version the problems are the same as always. Dumb AI which removes fun and challenge from the game, lack of AI team building skills, lack of AI rotation and training skills. To be fair, this hasn't changed since 97 my first CM game, another thing that hasnt changed is the exact same path to success. I take a League 2 club in England, get promoted first season, finish in the top 2 in the next 2 seasons and bam premiership. Than it will usually be mid-table first season, maybe Europe qulaification, top 4 next season and after that winning everything every year. This exact path happens with any club I take, using exactly the same tactics, every year of FM in the last 20 years. I dont rotate tactics, I dont tweak them I play the same tactic all the time, every match. Each mid season I get most of my players on free transfer as I never have any money, I focus on the best coaches and scouts I can get and make sure I have 2 players for each position. In lower leagues the loan system makes it easy to get 4 top players for your team especially if you get someone like Chelsea as your parent club. I did in my latest run with Blackpool. So I ask myself if I do the exact same thing for the last 15-20 years and get exactly the same results what has all the development led to. We get more fluff, media, social, (ok the stadia is nice) players morale, agents, etc etc but those are all just addons, the core game has not improved. So should you buy it? Not if you have any of the previosus versions. If the game is new to you than yeah. Personally I am dissapointed that in the 20 something editions the core game has not been improved at all.IN my steam library I have over 700 hours in fm2013, over 800 in fm2015 and now 90 or so in fm2017. Really disappointing. !!!!Here is some advice to devs - teach AI how to build squads and to rotate players, make sure that their team doesnt have half of the first 11 with 80% fitness when I play them towards the end of the season. I can manage my squad on the lowest average attendance and lowest salary, rotate it and finish first without problems. My team of talented free transfers should not be able to storm the league. I do want to fight to avoid relegation, I do want to stay in a certain league for a couple of seasons, I do want to have time to develop players, at the moment I change the squad drastically every year untill I get to winning champions league. My rise should not be guaranteed!!!			"

												Changing my review because this has to be the worst FM in recent memory.1. Instructions and tactics do not matter. No matter what you do you'll lose depending on your luck.2. The AI is the worst I have seen. Their attributes do not matter. Can't hold a lead,can't score a goal and yet they manager to annoy me in different ways possible. Their stupidity is almost hlarious.3.Social feed is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. Gets more boring and repetitive than press conferences. I don't even bother anymore.4. Penalties are not realistic at all. Will not score most of the time and trust me,there will be lots of times.5. Referee gives cards like it's his birthday. One touch,yellow. Another touch,goodbye. Yet the opponent somehow manages to get away with ""warnings"" all the time.6. Agents ask for new deals just months after signing a new deal. If you don't oblige, the player's morale drops drastically and you're forced to sell him. Kudos to realism.7. The lag between the menus is atrocious. For mostly a single player game it's ridiculous.8. Did I mention the AI stupidity ? Oh well, THEY ARE THAT STUPID. Never pass, lose the ball and voila a goal.9. The new ""3D graphics"" looks the same like last year's and the year before that and the year before that. Shame that SI is going the FIFA route and just adding aesthitic elements instead of concentrating on the ""Managerial"" stuff. Atleast the FIFA graphics looks better.I've never been this disappointed and irritated by any FM ever. Shame I can't get a refund.Heed the majority advice and DO NOT BUY this game.			"

(played 15 over 2000 something hours, that's how much i enjoyed it and i still do) 16 was the worst FM game ever made!! 17, still bad, really bad, not as bad as 16, but bad, i mean yeah, new staff roles are kind of cool, even though some of them are absolutely pointless! but game logic? i see some others mentioned it, but come on man, 30 shots on goal but only 1 or 2 goals? and opposition gets 2 chances and scores them both? even though they are not a high level team nor have a good striker for that matter? that's just absurd, i mean sure, there should be some diffculties to the game, otherwise you keep dominating, but make them sensiblei set up the best backroom staff that i can, best physios, club doctor, best fitness coaches and still my players gets injured very often and not even minor injuries, lots of major ones, if hiring the best of best is not going to make any difference, then what's the point of spending all your time to find the best coaches and physios? what's the point of the attributes of coaches and physios if they are not going to make any difference?seriously, SI, you are losing us!for 18 you guys should make some real changes, i'm not talking about what you did for 17, just some minor changes from 16 and here's a new game! you ripped us off!most fans of the game had problems with 16 and yet you didn't care, you didn't listen to them, all you did just a little tweak here and there, but not good enough tweaks! and here is 17!, seriously try to go couple years back, try to make the game as good as it was back in 14 or 15, using some celebrities for some weird ads on net, not going to make the game any better, make some real changes, give us something better, most fans been loyal to the game for years and this is how you are paying us back for our loyalty? with an over-priced s****y game?yes, making the game a little harder could be good, because i used to just dominate the league and CL, but make it in a way that makes sense, not in a way that makes you want to destroy your computer because even though your team gets more than enough chances to score 3-4 goals and that you have a good striker, but yet can only score one against a fairly weak opponent or where tactics doesn't matter,so no matter how much you work on finding the best tactic for your team, it's not going to make that big of a difference, because of the game mechanism, you still end up having the same problemsyes, add new staff roles, but ones that are actually useful and makes a difference, don't add something useless just for the sake of giving us something new, yes, we would love to see new staff roles or some new features of the game, but we want them to make the game better, to add something to itfor 18, do something good, because right now, i'd rather play 15 or go way back and play CM 07 or 08, instead of playing 16 or 17, we've been loyal fans for years, you should be loyal to your fans as well, don't try to rip us off, because we may be loyal now, for the sake of the past, but sure as hell won't stay loyal to a company that doesn't give a damn about what we think and giving us some s****y versions of a game we love and making us like it less and less every year, so don't take your fans for granted, some other game companies did the same, with different football manager games, and they lost their fans and now those games are just history, that's what happens when you don't give your fans what they want and when you try to rip them of, so take it serious, give us something good, something really good, because if you fail us for another year, FM is going to be history as well!

												Been a huge fan of FM for many years. However this game just baffles me... Having read some negative comments recently, unfortunately I have to side with them. I understand you have to be patient for your tactics to gel, and in every team I have. But surely when you keep having 30-40 shots a game compared to the oppositions 5-10 I should be winning or at least drawing games... But nope, you come up against mid level/lower teams who have hardly scored (Average less than a goal a game) then you lose 0-3, 0-2, 1-3, or the last minute 0-1 because of a mistake by your defender usually...I've alternated with different tactics, all with the familiarity high same thing keeps happening. Then you play the so called bigger teams and I always seem to well against them. Unfortunately FM this is the last time I will be purchasing this franchise game. It's just not consistent.			"

												Tried this on the free weekend and it felt just like 2016.  I have bought every single football manager every single year. This year I didnt because of the bad reviews and playing the free weekend showed me why.  Its just a database update, charging a full game price for it is just greedy.  Just like screwing up the business model for football manager live, that game was amazing and I was happy to pay 30 a month for it which I did.  So to conclude here,Stop charging people full price for a database update,Bring back football manager live!			"

												I've bought and played CM/FM since Championship Manager 2 and this is the first year where I can honestly say I haven't enjoyed the game.I find the tactic system this year to be far too forced. If I want to play leaving the majority of my tactics up to my *cough* world class *cough* assistant manager, I'll be lucky to see out the season before I get sacked. If I dive into the tactics and give it my all, even using the tactics posted on the workshop which claim to be amazing, I still lose games I really shouldn't.Also, I know the amount of money in football is becoming ludicrous these days but to even talk to a player in FM I have to triple or even quadruple their value, and good luck getting hold of cheap youngsters; if you are a big club they expect big money, sometimes Â£10-20m for players that aren't even good enough to be in the first team at lesser clubs, ridiculous.I'm at a loose-end. If you look at my played times for the last few years FM games, you'll see 1000+, 2000+ hours, but I just can't stomach it this year. I can only hope that SI have seen just how negative the reviews have been this year and get on and fix the game for next year.I want to be able to play my deeply immersive football management sim again without having to be a professional tactician.

Way to many games has my team collaps and concede 3 goals in 5 minutes around the 70 minute mark. I could accept that if opposing teams didnt ALWAYS score on at least 50 % of their chances and my team needs a minimum of 15 shots on target to score one goal.			"

												Been playing since champ man 1 so ive seen it all,  This one is pretty bad lots of bugs lots of random things happen in match engine same old replies to press gets annoying after the first 100 times,players act like babies if they dont play after 3 or 4 matches, oppenent still gets a miracous comeback even if your 4-0 up but that's been happening since the first fm it never happens to the pc only to you though.They need a shake up at sega get some new blood in and get rid of the old guard they are making your franchise stale who knows maybe someone will bring out a competitor soon			"

												It is what it is. The game is well established and I've loved it since old Championship Manager days before they changed franchise. It does keep getting better, and this version is probably the least needing 'patches' I can remember from any version.BUT.....the business model of releasing a new version every 12 month and then charging full price imvho is not worth the Â£/$'s for what extra you get on the previous year's version. Especially as you can get community led transfer updates etc (or do them yourself in the editor).SI the publisher have made it clear that they can't/won't get away from that annual release business plan but Â£20-30+ for an annual update is down to you whether it's worth it. For me it's not. Maybe buy it every 2-3 years to see real bang for your buck in improvements?Tactics wise it's more complex than ever and if I were a new player to the game I am not sure I'd cope. It's a massive (and brutal) steep learning curve as it's so in-depth. And sometimes things can go wrong for your team without knowing why unless you're deeply in to the game. There's a balance of realism or fun, and again that's for you to decide. One person's poison is another's pleasure etc.			"

												First review i ever wrote. This is more of a complaint or disconcerning fact. I decided to enroll as a manager for Chelsea, had a great season up until the 6th round of the FA-cup. As usual i saved my game before i started up the match vs. a Luton in quite a form. I went through the motions, did what adjustments I had done and had success with throughout the season, end result 0-7 to Luton. I thought to meself ""okelidoki.. let's try this again with the same line-up."" 2-8 to Luton. I ran that match 13 times with different line-ups and tactics, losing 11 and drawing 2 of those 13 matches. biggest loss was at a whopping 3-12. So i contacted the developers about this, and they reassured me that everything was in order that one of the world leading major teams could lose to a Skybet league 2 team 13 times in a row and bla. bla .bla. since i do not condone idiocy, i uninstalled this game of random outcome and i shall never again return to this outlet of my frustration, and neither should you. Spare yourself, be at peace knowing that in a righteouss and realistic world, Luton would never hammer an in form Chelsea, and those who dare to venture such an opinion... there's really nothing to be said about that.

												the last football manager i purchased was 2012 which was pretty decent, clocked up countless hours and managed to get past 2060 a couple of times.  this game however i cant even get to december 2016 without getting sacked.  ive tried about 5 times managing blackpool all with complete failure.  i managed to get promoted one season with a bit of saving to get past the playoffs but after a couple of months i was dragged into the dropzone.  i got called into the boardroom where i was told i had to win the next game to keep my job; it was a cup game which i won on penalties and yet still got sacked.  very annoying.and now to top it off, im for some reason having to reinstall fm17 again.  i like a challenge but come on.

												Have been playing football manager since it was known as championship managerOverall game medicore  AI needs vastly improvement and priority attention to be competitive and enjoyable game but nothing is done. Every edition is just tinker and looping Match engine back and forth and add in new database a new year version is releasedThis year the wideplayer is not effective you would go wilth 2 or 3 strikers and centralise formation then next version the wide becomes more effective and vice versa. endless loopingWhat a joke to thrash and humiliate Big teams domestic and europe as a smaller club. While in real life nobody enjoy playing against them and fear them. Attribute a trash in this game as the ME decides the attribute of players. My 7 passing fullback doing switch ball to other flanks. what a joke. and my arsenal francis coqeuelin scoring goals for fun.look at loki doki experimental youtube video you will be horrify to see how bad the game AI is finding and transfer players but that only a part of it. Social media and brexit is pretty much trash and repetitve to be ignoreIronically they feel Steam negative review was because of the chinese unhappy player.Positive thing is the injury is more realistic as older FM there is no reason to have a bigger squad and injuries is so rare same starting 11 every game week in week out.Contract negotiation has been positive as we players exploit AI and gives medicore contract to our favour but now agent staff and players now has chance to force you into  submitting into their offer or lose him.Stop tinkering your ME and improve your game AI.

												I believe that the match engine/experience itself hasn't progressed as needed considering all the bells and whistles that have been added in the last 3 or 4 years.The lack of feedback on what's going on in the match is becoming a serious issue hampering aspiring managers in the game. I shouldn't need to watch a full match of repetitive scripted animations that has no resemblance to real football whatsoever to try to spot a gap in midfield, A player tackling too hard or a full back moving two steps forward than needed. Especially when you give us an ME that's a crossing fest like last year.Here is a list of concerns:- Ratings:I remember on the good old days if I had all my team on 8's and two players on 6 then they are not performing and probably this is the cause of my worries. Now it seems that if all your players are on 7's and you are 3-0 down its fine because and I quote one of the deluded mods on SI forums :""Player ratings are an indicator of how your players are performing up to that point.. not any kind of indicator on the match or the opposition as a whole, Just because your players have ok ratings, doesn't mean they are doing what they need to be doing to win."" - Player performance/Body language:Again it has no clear meaning and is detached from the match engine completely. Even SI can't provide an actual explanation on how it works just like team talks. Does anyone actually use it?For example how can everyone be playing okay when we are 2 or 3 nil down? ....Or a scenario where all the goals come through our right back and it says the left back is having a bad game and ignores the actual cause.... Unless the ME is not consistent with the other features and is very limited in what it shows us.- As for the ME itself, I'll ignore the 3D animations because I don't think it's that important how it looks as long as it plays right.I remember playing 2D on FM 2008 and being able to differentiate between a pacey skillful player or a player with vision. Now it's just a player running in a straight line then crossing or a silly scramble where everyone stands like a scarecrow.The commentary at that time gave us hints about how the game is going. In 2016 the commentary is the same if not worse considering the limitations they had in the past.By 2017 I'd expect to see one twos, triangles, proper sweeper adaptation and maybe some more physicality. I expect the commentary to talk about a lot lot more.It's frustrating when you spend 2 hours tuning your tactics and going through all these fancy positions and roles and shapes to end up with 3 identical crossed goals, A bad backpass or a player with a longshot stat of 2 scoring 3 screamers for the first time in their career.The new features are an absolute joke, Instead of enhancing team talks, press conferences and giving us a stadium creator with a kit designer and sponsor choices, We end up with a face generator and a twitter gimmick that adds nothing to the game and is better implemented in iPad games.Of course on their official forums, You get some nazi level of modding that prevents anyone from expressing any concern, And a number of users that act like hunting dogs for their masters going around insulting the intelligence of everyone. FM 15 had games ending 7-4 5-3 and it was never addressed. FM 16 had crossed goals domingating the game with fullbacks winning player of the year awards constantly and this year itâs just a patch that fixese these two issues!! "

												I played this game for free over the weekend to see if it's really shity as the say it is. and my conclusion is if you manage to get through the social media â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t to the playing part, the game might be good, it has nice mechanism, tactics are tuned, finally the team actually plays the way you set them up(after so many years).Although the players development system is a surprisingly shity after so many years, game itself would be great if not for so much spam, but man do they spam. I wish I had adblock installed in this game. this is a sports social media simulation with option for player database and tactics if you want. the only thing you must do is recieve social media spam; for everything else you can delegate someone else to do it :D it they remove social media from next release, together with new database, they will already improve a lot from this year. I would not reccomend this game at full price because social media and others already paid half of that price prior to release.  "

I paid a lot of money to buy this game and I feel the creators stopped caring about the game and are looking only to grab our money. This year the game have also none improvement. It's like I'm playing a slightly revised version of FM16. Match Engine once again is bad, and I know that it is a football manager game and not FIFA but it is 2017, we want an dramatic improvement.

												This is the first time i buy Football manager game since 2013. I can see the major difference between these 2 version, but still beside the updated players database which for me to play the new one, i would rather ask for refund for this.The most severe issue is your match tactic doesn't making any sense. You are 0-2 down at the first half against a weaker team, much weaker team, and the shoot chance is about 10-2. You make changes in the changing room, whole team speed up, put more player to attacking, remove defensive midfielder and replace with a strike. Final score still 0-2, shoot chance is 11-2, one long shoot added in the second half. Wow! Brilliant.I played against Man City in FA cup quarter final, Man city put out several teenager in first starting line up which i never remember their names. I am leading the Premier league with massive advantage, and i field almost full first team in this match. I lose the game with 1-3, which Iheanacho scored an hat-trick, which currently lacking match fitness, only played 4 games with 20 games available. Nevermind, i want to do experiement that how many times i am gonna repeat the game until i win the game, i save and reload. The second time i win 4-0, which limit them with 1 shoot only. I changed nothing about the tactic, player and teamtalk. So conclusion, it's freaking random. RANDOM. And you are powerless to change that!			"

People complaining because don't have chinese... it will get in later patch but that's no reason to complain, many years ago there was only english so stop being childish;People complaining because they can't win... try and try and learn with your mistakes. As an football coach in real life you can't think you will succed every single time. WIth United in 6 years won 2 times Champions, 4 times Premier, 2 or 3 FA Cups, lost world cup final... Everything can happen and you need to play with every single factor and they are a lot.			"

												The game does not change very much from edition to edition. In fact, the updates they do provide could probably be done by a much smaller team than SI have.I do not agree with how they handle marketing, or how they treat fans. They rewarded them this year with a discount based on how many games they already own, which is  brilliant but they barely announced any new features before this reward was out of date. Not exactly fantastic from them.SI do not foster much love from the commnity, reguarly coming into confrontations with fans. The community itself does not foster much love from each other though, so both sides are responsible.The game is still good though, even if it isn't perfect. If you enjoyed FM16, or FM15 or before you might enjoy this game. Each successive game technically gets better, though everyone will have their favourite version.If you do not compare it to it's predecessors, and count out the fact it is practically a reskin and a paid update then you'll realise it is actually a very good game, and easy to sink plenty of hours into - as is proven by the statistics.

												Ive never played a more frustrating game. Every single game, i have 15 to 20 shots on target, the other team has 4 or 5 and  I end up losing. Now I know what people are thinking, get a new striker. But it makes no difference what strikers I use. It makes no difference what tactical changes I make. Ive just played a game where ive had 13 shots on goal and not scored any, my opposition had three shots on goal, all on target and theyve all gone in. Its not just an isolated incident, it happens every single game I play. I am convicned the AI teams are  weighted against a human player.It would also help if the devs actually understood the offside rule. So many times ive seen players (on both sides) that were inline with the last defender or even massively onside, be ruled offside.			"

												I've been playing since the 90s and really enjoyed the experience. Until now. I just can't get figure out how to win anymore. I've used my own experience, plus all the expertise available on various websites to try and succeed in the game, but it has defeated me, It seems the AI is just too smart. It's the same pattern with just about any game I play: I work hard to build a tactic and team do well then for no reason I get beaten every game with my team not even getting close. And there seems no way around it. If you change things around the players play like they've never met each other, but if you leave things alone the AI has you sussed and snuffs you out. It's just not enjoyable anymore, and it's such a shame.			"

												So I am on a 1.5 year old MacBook Pro Retina and I tried installing this POS game a few times already. For some reason, it runs either too small, too large, keeps crashing, etc., and I have to force quit it all the time. I tried it once. Asked for a refund. Read up and thought to myself ""Well, I think I understand what I did wrong the first time..."" Gave it another shot and now it's one terrible issue with the UI after another.What a terrible release.			"

												The online game is extremely slow! This is outrageous. Someone has to fix this as soon as possible!Is it either the netcode of the game itself or a problem from steam servers? I don't know....We try to play an on-line game with friends, all having good pcs and internet connections but it takes 20-30"" to open the tactics window for example.At least SI should consider re-enabling the LAN option so we can play faster without so much lagging if the problem comes from steam! Despite it is a great game, we cannot play online with that kind of lag and we consider to give up trying by not buying it again, unless a proper fix will solve this.			"

												I bought this one after I played all the series from FM 2005 to FM 2015. Took a break with FM 2016 and now I got 2017.I played over 170 hrs and I am quite sure that if nothing major comes through I will not continue to play the series.All in all here are some of my thoughts. Some bugs are there even 17.2.0. SI comunication with the comunity is poor. They los a lot of licenses and that affects the feeling you while playing. I know you can get club badges and names from comunity but still is annoying. Sometime it gets frustrating with all the injuriesSome teams and players are overrated and I talk about small leagues especially.  "

												its my first football manager since i dont know when, so for me its alright, i cant compare it to FM16.BUT for the love of everything.. the actual footballgame itself is cancer to the eyes. we are in the year 2017 and i have to watch those handicaped players with a broom up their â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ing around the pitch. its not a bit real, the moves are pathetic, ballphysic? pff, no need for that. i play fifa almost everyday and i dont want to compare, but PLEASE, at least try to make it look like a footballmatch ffs. i mean, its whats its all about, its why u buy players and train them and stuff, its the actual match. its like vomit with two feet. the first fifa looks actually better than this pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥.and for the love of everything, this â¥â¥â¥â¥game is the 5th or 6th most played game on steam right now. there is a HUGE playerbase for a manager game:FFS PLEASE, ANY OTHER DEV: PLEASE MAKE A BETTER GAME THAN THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i dont get it, why is there no actual alternative to this suckfest?

												A lot of people complaining because they lose games... that's football and I don't mind if I lose a few games that I dominate. I support Southampton so I'm kind of used to losing randomly at Hull, etc. The thing i'm annoyed about is random in game crashes are now MORE likely to happen despite a fix saying otherwise (note to self, autosave once a week!) plus Goalkeeper AI is pretty bad, near post goals happen all the time. If they patch that then it will be a pretty strong game. it's still playable just about as whilst GK's are bad, so is the AI's so you can kinda level things out. Regardless, this is a negative review for now as they should have polished these issues out in the first patch.			"

Product received for free
												Every year I spend about 300 yuan, which is about 30pounds, on FM and FMM even though my laptop can only run FM at an incredibly slow speed. I used to play pirated FMH 2013 because I didn't know I could buy a genuine version. Now with more and more Chinese people choose to pay for their FM products, it really hurts that there is no simplified Chinese version of the game, especially when versions of  less spoken languages like Korean are available.

Unconsistency and RANDOMNESS in the match engine..But a consistent theme of SAME EXACT goals going in against you mainly wingbacks peeling off and crossing on ANY TACTIC including top forum tactics (before you start saying â¥â¥â¥â¥ like of your tactic is poor) no SAME â¥â¥â¥â¥ with top forum tactics btw if you carefully read then there arent actually too many working formations atm and any kind of â¥â¥â¥â¥ you try is unconsistent ..the only thing that has any kind of consistency at all is if you play CANCER NARROW 4-3-1-2 or some kind of 5-3-2 wingback formation without wingers and even that tends to be sketchy and concedes rediculous but repetitive goals..read reviews and see...I played fm since 2006 the game is more cancer than ever ..Absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥ dont buy!I TRIED VARIUS FORUM TACTICS AND SYSTEM AND CURRENTLY I UNINSTALLED THE GAME DUE TO SHITNESS OF MATCH ENGINE			"

												Barely touched since FM 2015 in terms of updates.They've added a Social Media feed which is unbelievably repetative about your MoTM every week if you win.Don't expect to have a full fit squad, ever, no matter how good your fitness coaches are or how good your medical team is, tha max you'll have your starting 11 you want is 2 games, 7 injuries to my first team on light training at beginning of one season, 5 injuries to the first team at the beginning of the next season are examples of the joke fitness system they've rigged about with,Players become unhappy randomly! A Backup player will kick off at the age of 34 for not playing games, you'll agree to sell him and the rest of the squad will become unhappy, and that'll leave you being unable to score goals and conceeding for days even though you have 2 top class strikers with service every game and the best defence in the leaue prior the conversation.Not worth Â£19.99 this year never mind Â£34.99.

												As a new member of the FM community, I personally don't see what all of the negative reviews are about. It may not be terribly different from FM 2016, but the level of vitrol over that seems... excessive. Personally, I find consistency to be rather positive in a long-running series such as this. And while sometimes wonky things can happen with the match results (22 shots on target, 75% possession, lose 3-1), screaming angrily at the players usually fixes that particular problem, I've found.Also, I put 100 hours into this game within three or four weeks. I never do that. Ever.			"

												There has been quite a bit of negative reviews assocaited with this game. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. That is great.For my opinion, I'd say this is the best game in recent years. However, I will say there are nuances that are annoying.The match engine itself has had a massive upgrade and it's noticeable. However, with that massive upgrade, it created issues in the 3D match engine. They significantly tried to reduce the OP part of crossing from fullbacks/wingbacks generating 20-30 assists a season in FM16. To do this, they've changed the way wingbacks/fullbacks operate. Wingbacks/fullbacks hold the ball way to long before crossing so nearly all crosses are blocked or honestly just poor crosses. The play looks choppy/unintelligent when the wingback/fullback is yards past the defender, but then holds the ball for 2-3 seconds and allows the defender to catch up so he can block the cross.Goalkeepers are....interesting at the best of times, and just laughable at the worst of times. There's also still the weird issue (I'd say bug) where the opposition will score their 1st shot on goal on approximately 60% of the attempts. It won't be a clear cut or half chance, it'll just be a weird shot that goes in. It is what it is. Also, it's much more difficult to use a plug and play tactic. That plug and play tactic will generally be successful for you I'm sure. But if you're truly looking for an unbeaten season without reloading, minor changes will occur during the season as the opposition will learn/adapt to your style, as well as in game, quirky things happen. This is similar to real life. At any time, some team can beat another team. It happens.People also complain about injuries. Yes they are an issue; but I suggest you look at your the teams in the league you watch and see how many teams have 2-5 players injured at any given time, for small 5-15 day injuries plus the long term injuries too. Injuries are in part, down to your tactic, your training intensity, lack of rotation etc. Another thing that loses it's useful/entertaining aspect of it, is the social media addition. It's great for 3-4 games. Then it's very repetitive and worthless.All in all, the game is overly positive, I just wanted to lay out a few negative issues so that people are aware of them, and they know what to expect going in. I'd recommend the game.			"

Avoid it if you are still having fun with previous titles, but if you want an updated database and some little improvements go for it. I'm having fun again after 1000+ hours in fm 2016.

I must admit to say.. what  the heck did you even think?!. I have expected bugs. Alot of them actually, but iÂ´d never imagined that you.. The devs would be so ignorant and go the length of actually ignore the massive span of rapports of bugs comming through each day with words like ""Oh, it SHOULD be like that, your defenders should act like theyÂ´ll never been on a football pich before"". Oh, right.. its a review submit, not a rage quit submit. Football manager. you take care of your favorite team until you eather get deported for someone else, or go the distance to take the podium among the legendary other managers there are, and have been throughout history. There review done. Now for the important question, would i recommend this game?.. Sure i would. â¥â¥â¥â¥ the bugs how gamebreaking they are. And yes, some are excpetionally gamebreaking. But what do i care?. Well take a gander at the fields of where i grow the â¥â¥â¥â¥s to give, and look how barren it is. There, done. If you a long time fan, buy the â¥â¥â¥â¥. Are you a new beginner?. Go one step back and get FM16. And for all of us that still glings to the hope that the devs gets a stern talk to by the management, we'll wait and see when you guys actually want to do your job and take it a bit serious and fix the game.

 Meh Pretty much the same I last year but with fewer licences (Spain), Naming of Brazilian teams like FLE, BOT, SAN just seems amateurish.
The default skin looks good, kind of like FM05.
No new tactical options (no differnt types of pressing, different phases  and transitionsetc) this should be the main focus of the game but they are becoming a bit too simplistic.
Im sure i'll end up playing at least 500 hours though. "

The game has depth, UI is easy and pleasant to navigate, player interaction and behaviour is unpredictable but logical, matches themselves seem realistic and entertaining to watch and manage.One of those cases where you have to ignore the reviews and judge a product by yourself.

												The game has its faults, its a simulation after all, but the general game is excellent. If you struggle, perhaps try changing tactics and not stubbornly assuming yours should conquer all. The game is far tougher than previous iterations, with success much harder to come by, though achieving it feels even more satisfying. What it isn't is a huge leap from previous games, as always its a small improvement which can be irritating. Personally, i enjoy it greatly, and the discount for previous players is a welcome addition, though certainly should be more (~40% off real price) in my opinion			"

												Probably the most in-depth version of the game yet, those who are complaining about injuries or red cards are obviously training wrong or have their players set to go around kicking people, these are easily solvable issues.The pre-order discount for owning the previous titles was a nice bonus.Can't recommend it enough, will easily plough another 300-400 hours into this version.

												It is a great game despite its flaws.. I signed on as Anderlecht manager and had a real rollercoaster season. Going well in third place and then injuries hit and I had to use my reserve, reserve CB who had never played in the side before. I also decided to try to counter the defensive tactics of the AI (it started to use two defensive midfielders against me) with more direct football and I lose 4-0 away from home. My heaviest defeat. FC Brugge big derby is the next match. I don't set up my team in the right way and I am down 2-0 in 12 minutes. I sub a player and go on the attack. I score six goals and end up winning 6-2.. Watching all those goals fly past their keeper was very enjoyable. These kind of crazy games and situations come up all the time and they make you want to play the game more and more so you can get that new star defender in or start another striker that you have been warming up in the reserves.Yes, there is not much difference between this game and previous versions. However, it still packs a punch and is well worth buying despite the annoyances (not easy to defend, players getting unhappy all the time, numerous injuries, etc, etc). 8.5/10			"

												Sports Interactive has finally given some attention to the core of the game this year: the match engine. The match engine has undergone some massive improvements. Players move in a more clever way both with and without the ball. They will also make more sensible decisions on the pitch. For example, players reaching the byline will now actually look for a teammate to pass to instead of shooting from an impossible angle.The other noticeable difference is the way information is presented to you. I will just give a few examples here. FM17 continues the trend of previous versions in presenting information in a more graphical way. Graphs and pie charts have never been more abundant. This is the right way to go in a game driven by data. Backroom advice is now integrated in different parts of the game. Your inbox is now as useful as ever, as you will now be able to make an aggregate of decisions with just one mouseclick.All these little tweaks and better integration of existing features make Football Manager 2017 feel like a finished product. Combine this with a highly improved match engine and you know you're doomed to have another year without a social life. Just one more game, I promise.Written by a FM addict for a FM addict			"

												At a glance FM 17 doesn't appear to change much on the surface from FM 16 - but in truth the game changed in more ways than people think.First of all, back post crosses are no longer extremely OP, and you can actually use other tactics than exploit the back stick. But I feel like this has been replaced with screamers, and boy have I seen some screamers. Secondly all the improvements to the analytical part of the game, adding a passing diagram and a data analysist staff role helps you figure out what makes your tactic tick. No ZM or spielverlagerung level of detail yet, but I feel like that would make the game too easy. Also, the improved screen for your youth team games allows you to keep tabs on your squads of regen wunderkids from obscure countries. Overall, I feel like FM 17 is a step forward in the series, but still seems a little safe.Also, ignore the negative reviews that complain about no translation, SI added in a Community Translation feature so you can translate it into your language if it is not supported by the game natively.

												Seems that most negative reviews are about there not being a Chinese localisation. They might still add one in the future, relax guys.---Anyway, is it worth buying FM 17? Well the answer is simple: if you're a fan of the series then yes, if you're new to the series then yes.If you're expecting football as a sport to suddenly add laser shooting or something crazy then no.Seriously I don't get why people keep saying they didn't innovate this year. The sport itself doesn't change much, it's the same thing you're watching every year, just with different players and coaches.So does FM17 do an amazing job at keeping up? Yes!- improved match engine- social media added to simulate real life- Brexit simulator - quality of life improvement- completely up to date player/staff - improved fantasy draftThat and many smaller features, too many to mention here.It's another year of football and it's another great year for Football Manager.Now buy it, play it and get addicted!

												Rarely have I been so conflicted over a game.The game isn't as bad as people are making out. A lot of people seem to take issue with losing when they have more shots; something which happens in real life on the regular. If you're dominating the game and getting loads of shots, I don't get why people can't conceive of teams soaking up pressure and hitting you on the counter. Another issue oft mentioned is the goalkeepers. I haven't personally encountered them messing up more than is normal, although the 3D engine does have a habit of making some things look more ridiculous than they would in real life (passbacks, own goals etc.). A number of people posting bad reviews (by no means all of them) sound like they just can't take losing. The game needs to be challenging and frustrating. It would be very boring if your tactics always worked, you always won the games you deserved, and your players never got injured (another complaint I have seen) or made mistakes.My main issue with the game isn't what is wrong with it, but the lack of progress. A few tweaks here and there, a couple of new, minor, features, but basically the same game as last year. No new tactical instructions, minimal updates to tactical analysis of opposition (or your own team). It's a better game than 16, but not by enough. To be honest it feels like a very expensive patch. Set pieces are still very basic. The monotonous press conferences continue, and few new questions have been added. There are some in-engine issues - long shot goals are far too rare proportionate to real life, and even on 'very fluid' teams stay unrealistically structured (if you look at average positions you can see this), and crosses go to the goalie to often. It's frustrating that the issues are largely the same as last year, as it shows SI aren't listening to a community which is very loyal and helps them out a lot by creating content to fill the gaps they leave (badge packs etc.). If you're going to get something wrong, which is probably inevitable for a simulator, at least get different things wrong! It'd keep the game fresh. I am still really enjoying this game nonetheless, and would always recommend it purely because it is still by far the world's leader in its genre. However, as the worst received and least improved edition of the series, SI really need to come up with some new ideas and do some serious overhauls.  "

												Some people wonât be convinced by the game this year and will stick with their saves from last yearâs edition. But looking at the game this year, and comparing to my long running 2015 save, I can see the changes to the match engine, contracts and finances and quality of life improvements adding up. It doesnât hurt that this is the most polished and accurate the match engine has felt for many years.Will picking up 2017 change your life if youâve been enjoying one of the recent games? No, but you will certainly end up with a more rounded management experience, with the extras like Fantasy Draft now offering you something worth checking out.

												If you have any fond memories of the Football Manager francise then avoid this game! The match engine that was meant to have been revamped is terrible. Opposition players some how manage to outplay your team in most games even though your players are much better. The decision making of the players was meant to have been upgraded but its awfu, your players can't make simple 5m passes yet the other team can hit crossfield balls no problem, simple obvious passes are ignored in favour of shots from 40 yards instead. This means your constantly giving up possesion for no reason and then the other team goes up the field and gets a shot on target at your goal so you concede a large amount of goals. Rather than waste Â£28 it would be a better idea just to buy the editor for last year and move players about that would effect your league. This game has been slowly declining in playability over the last few years but this years edition has taken a mighty leap down the spectrum. As a long term fan and player (over 10 years) I really hope the full game is vastly improved on the beta version, otherwise I can see FM losing fans over the next few years.			"

												Brilliant and immersive football game with outstanding attention to detail.I've never written a review for anything before and never commented on youtube etc but I feel I need to address the balance of the negative reviews I've seen for this game on Steam.This game is so much fun. You have the ability to manage and control more aspects of football management than ever before and if, like me , you are fascinated by the beautiful circus that is modern day football management you will love this game. I completely understand the frustration of users loosing games and not understanding why their strikers aren't scoring but that's part of the beauty. Sometimes you loose and sometimes you get battered this IS football simulation. There are tricks, combinations of attributes, tactics, ways of tweaking and manipulating the game to find a way of playing and affecting the game. The only answer I can find to people's negative experiences wouldn't be down to a instant gratification people's expect from almost anything these days. Your team needs care ,attention, and lord knows a lot of time and sacrifice to get right but it's ultimately so rewarding. The database it self is outstandingly accurate. Subjective perhaps, but with an editor that anyone can use if you don't like or agree with player attributes you have to ability to change It. What other game can boast that.I'll speak for myself and this years version is the most fun I've had playing the series and apart from a brief hiatus at university I've played all the games so far. A thanks to all the team who work on the game and keep up the good work. Keep creating and i will keep playing and enjoying.			"

												CONSGame doesnt know Free kicks rule (when to give a card and when not to), game doesnt know offside rules.Injuries are too many.Work permit for a premier league team for a player who would be in the starting 11, rubbish not to give this. probably due to all the racism going on in Britain atm so the game probably adopted the racism too.Still too many stupid questions young player signings is not a job for the manager to answer those questions rubbish and waste of game time, and sometimes they ask 3 questions that basically are the same, can also focus on a person who wasnt man of match, again bad journalism and stupid.Skins are awfull looking IÂ¨ve had to download skins from awsome modders,. but that FM lacks that much of commitment to make beautifull skins is a grand minus.No pictures of the players, you have to download it from example FM scout.They said they had made a lot of changes game is more or less the same changes in overall is minor.Pros:Game is still the most realistic Football manager game to date.Still fun game and has a lot of details.Boardroom advice is now in the inbox and I do like this change.Game has gotten an upgrade in graphics.Game has gotten some new staff jobs, though not very detailed and they should probably have set a certain trait for those jobs, but nevertheless they are still there.My personal rating 2/10After having played it some more too many bugs are in the game, free kicks unrealistic players with a rating of 17 only hit inside goal frame 1 out of 40.Yellow cards are given to players who do absolutely noghing than standing behind a player who falls. crappy display of a freekick.Players forget ball like a toddler would do when dribbling. meaning ball lies still and they continue to run resulting in the opponent picking ball up...wtf who on earth is that stupid other than a toddler not know what he or she is playing.They promissed a lot of changes yet skin is still crappy and the same.Game is basically nothng more than an update and too many crappy bugs are in the game.

												I've read other reviews about this game and having viewed a lot of the flack the game as got I felt obliged to weigh in.  I've bought every FM since I can remember and put A LOT of time into each version.  Yes the graphics in the match engine could be better, the press conferences are a drag and the new social media tab is repetitive, but overall the game is great.  It hasn't brought in hundreds of new additions from last year, but as the old adage goes 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it'.  It is still a wondrously in depth game that requires thought and attention rather than button mashing and luck.  I get the frustration with results when having 20+ shots yet losing 1-0, but this happens in real life not just FM.  I don't understand complaints about the game being just a database update when FIFA has barely changed a thing in 10 years yet charges Â£50 every year without fail for the same game with an updated database.  At least FM is only Â£35, with a far larger database, far more realistic and often available on offers during either sales or reduced as part of a loyalty deal.   In conclusion, if you want a more realistic experience then it's FM every time.  If you're happy watching David Alaba join Juventus for Â£30 million on deadline day (without fail) then play FIFA.  Both games have their place.  Personally I feel SI are doing a great job.			"

I have seen a lot of the criticism up here on this comment board, and it almost dissuaded me from buying the game, but I'm glad I bought it anyways. I honestly dont understand the criticism having played the game now, it's a worthy successor in the FM series, and it makes several fun improvements over the last edition of the game. The match engine is a bit better, the tactics have more possible permutations, the transfer system has been improved; its an all around good game, and I recommend it.			"

												This is a pro/con review but at first a review for the rest reviewers (just skip the next words)Whoever said that this is yet another database update then obviously you are lying that you are a fan of game and most importantly fan of the sport. Sega and sports interactive promised many little changes, and they done what they promised. You can notice them on the long base. And THE MOST IMPORTANT is stop review the game on account of in-game happenings. For example stop giving bad reviews for ""many injuries"" or ""crazy transfers"". This is what modern football is. Actually real  football is sometimes is more crazy and irritating than fm2017 so stop complaining. Is a simulator not an arcade. Also you chinese dont deserve chinese language with so much hate that you put on this game. Seriously you ruined it with this reviews.Pro----+match engine more balanced and beautiful than last year+more clear and useful interface+enhanced individual scouting+now tactics are more flexible and most of them are easily translated back to you (for example it was mee difficult on the past to experiment with the 3-man defence or midfielder roles)+more player roles+many stability changes that make fm2017 more reliable and close to the real football (transfer clauses, enemy team scouting, match report, staff roles)Cons-------still the training system is very simple for the needs of a manager especially to small teams-AI makes very abnormal transfer choices even for the standars of real football-very limited communication with your athletes and media-there are stuff which are useless to the game and only waste time like social media, character personalization and 3d modelGenerally a 7/10			"

												I've only played 4 league matches so far with Arsenal. Across 4 matches and in excess of 40 shots, I have 2 goals.Against Swansea I had 24 shots, 6 on target. No goals. Swansea had 1 shot, 1 on target 1 goal.I'm picking up loads of injuries as per usual.It's literally the same issues every year. I must be stupid to persevere, but I'm always stupid enough to think that this is the year they will fix it.This game is so broken. It used to be SO good, but SI have really lost their magic touch.

												I've read other reviews about this game and having viewed a lot of the flack the game as got I felt obliged to weigh in.  I've bought every FM since I can remember and put A LOT of time into each version.  Yes the graphics in the match engine could be better, the press conferences are a drag and the new social media tab is repetitive, but overall the game is great.  It hasn't brought in hundreds of new additions from last year, but as the old adage goes 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it'.  It is still a wondrously in depth game that requires thought and attention rather than button mashing and luck.  I get the frustration with results when having 20+ shots yet losing 1-0, but this happens in real life not just FM.  I don't understand complaints about the game being just a database update when FIFA has barely changed a thing in 10 years yet charges Â£50 every year without fail for the same game with an updated database.  At least FM is only Â£35, with a far larger database, far more realistic and often available on offers during either sales or reduced as part of a loyalty deal.   In conclusion, if you want a more realistic experience then it's FM every time.  If you're happy watching David Alaba join Juventus for Â£30 million on deadline day (without fail) then play FIFA.  Both games have their place.  Personally I feel SI are doing a great job.			"

												This is a pro/con review but at first a review for the rest reviewers (just skip the next words)Whoever said that this is yet another database update then obviously you are lying that you are a fan of game and most importantly fan of the sport. Sega and sports interactive promised many little changes, and they done what they promised. You can notice them on the long base. And THE MOST IMPORTANT is stop review the game on account of in-game happenings. For example stop giving bad reviews for ""many injuries"" or ""crazy transfers"". This is what modern football is. Actually real  football is sometimes is more crazy and irritating than fm2017 so stop complaining. Is a simulator not an arcade. Also you chinese dont deserve chinese language with so much hate that you put on this game. Seriously you ruined it with this reviews.Pro----+match engine more balanced and beautiful than last year+more clear and useful interface+enhanced individual scouting+now tactics are more flexible and most of them are easily translated back to you (for example it was mee difficult on the past to experiment with the 3-man defence or midfielder roles)+more player roles+many stability changes that make fm2017 more reliable and close to the real football (transfer clauses, enemy team scouting, match report, staff roles)Cons-------still the training system is very simple for the needs of a manager especially to small teams-AI makes very abnormal transfer choices even for the standars of real football-very limited communication with your athletes and media-there are stuff which are useless to the game and only waste time like social media, character personalization and 3d modelGenerally a 7/10			"

												I've played CM/FM since CM99. I love these games, and Football Manager 2017 is a consistent and solid game that improves on its predecessors. I have seen a lot of the criticism up here on this comment board, and it almost dissuaded me from buying the game, but I'm glad I bought it anyways. I honestly dont understand the criticism having played the game now, it's a worthy successor in the FM series, and it makes several fun improvements over the last edition of the game. The match engine is a bit better, the tactics have more possible permutations, the transfer system has been improved; its an all around good game, and I recommend it.			"

												It's a good game, it always is. Nevertheless it feels like so much more could be done to enhance it. SI have no real competition, so these annual launches really feel like patches on last year's edition. I still play it to pieces every year and have done since the very first Championship Manager was launched in 1992 (imagine that, kids!). I'm hoping SI will look at developing the match day experience a bit more. I played and loved Cities:Skylines with its endless plethora of user-generated mods. Why not make the stadia moddable for FM 18? I am sure this would result in beatiful, immersive, player-generated replicas of existing grounds which would make it so much more enjoyable for me watching Lazio draw 1-1 at home against Frosinone and throw away the last Europa League place in the league, which happened just last weekend. Seriously though SI, get it done. It would cost you nothing and enhance the game so much.			"

												I like the game a lot better than FM 2016. Here is what I love about it:The match engine looks a bit more realistic when it comes to play and goals . I was tired of seeing the same goals with my tactics - the fullback crosses to the far post and my winger or striker scores. Now I have more goals from long range, keeper mistakes when there is a deflection or the keeper made a step more.I get many offers for my players and some of them can be negotiated to triple the price if the buying team have a big budget, which was impossible for smaller clubs until now. I hope this is not a bug and the official release will carry high interest.The new feature using my photo to generate my manager worked fantastic for me when I switched from the recommended low to medium graphics. My wife was amazed how realistic it looked and we spend an hour ""trying out"" outfit colors, hairstyle and so on because of her.The social feed - while you guys try to read the tweets, the thing I like the most is that I no longer have to subscribe to players, teams and competitions. Besides twitter reactions there are headlines when you follow something which works very good and I don't have to get them in my inbox anymoreOdds for youth player awards and top goal scorers before the season outlining the leaders in the category.The Pre-season reports for a team watch, the next opposition report and the post match reports are well presented now highlighting the important stuff.

The settings used for my matches is only Key Commentary, and it's preatty predictable what happens next. Usually when durring the a key higlight if a own player produces a mistake (lost possesion durring attack, wrong pass in the middle, fall down by mistake etc) that's when I realise that the opponent is going to score against me. Basically Key Commentary is now predicting that somebody is going to score - at least 85% from key commentary are goals.			"

												Well, I feel 10 hours and half a season in is a good time to review this years FM in its beta stage.  I don't recommend it unless they fix the huge issues of injuries.  I had 5 injured players in 2 days, the third day was match, 3 injuries in the one game brought me to having 8 injuries in my first team. Unplayable as it is right now, will change this if these problems are sorted after release.**Edit:  I now have 30 hours playing, this is because I started a new game with a team who have enough money to build a bigger squad to deal with the injuries. So yes, its playable with enough club funds, not playable with a team who starts with 40k transfer funds and a small first team**			"

												Don't know why this version got negative reviews. I am enjoying it alot more than previous versions. The match engine seems to have been improved. On FM 2016 fullbacks would get a ton of assists with crosses. Now it seems like it's different kind of goals scored rather than from crosses all the time. You can still concede stupid goals like in FM 2016, but it seems like it's improved sligthly on that part aswell. When it comes to transfers I find it really hard to sell players even if they have performed really well for a season. It was hard enough as it is on FM 2016 to sell players, but it seems even harder on this version. Dunno if it's because I'm playing as Walsall, but I'm expecting to atleast to sell a player for half his value. Anyways, I could write alot more of pros and cons, but just can't be bothered. That's enough from me!			"

												Started the game, did the mandatory save, then did a bunch of stuff like hiring coaches, scout some players setting up tactics etc, an hour of my time even before clicking on Continue.Then the game crashed. One hour of my life, poofed.This series has been on a downhill for so many years, yearly incremental updates with nothing revolutionary with the sole aim of milking the fans. But that's not the developers' fault though. This is how the gaming scene is every year. Just look at Fifa for eg.Anyway â¥â¥â¥â¥ this â¥â¥â¥â¥ of a game. Please have some respect for the fans and for what you are trying to create. I won't even  pay $10 for this when I can't even play an hour of the game without crashing.It's one thing about messing up a series. It's another about killing off an entire genre. "

												Love this Series in general. Was not a huge fan of FM2016 for some reason. But I am really enjoying the changes in FM2017. Some are just subtle graphical fixes/improvements, others have to do with the AI of the match engine being smarter. Either way love the game, it is getting better and better every year.P.S.

More importantly, you guys don't keep your word to release chinese which is of great dishonesty. This is a kind of fraud. Last but not the least, you guys want to make money from chinese market without providing best service to meet chinese customers' need. It's an irresponsible behaviour.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ I wrote this negative feedback in english insted of dirty words in chinese to show my respect to you. At the same time, I'm wondering how you guys should regard negative feedbacks from chinese as a ""deadly threat"" as your manager said in public? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Add chinses please! I do not need it. But my fellows need it. Most of them are poor of english because they are not specialist in english and they play different roles on their professions, instead of trading or communciating with english-speakers. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ENGLISH OR ANY OTHER LANGUAGE is not a necessary ability for all my fellows.

												It's an improvement on Football Manager 2016, that's for sure. Don't see why loads of Chinese people are complaining about the game and giving it a bad rating, although it's become a typical feature on FM reviews over the past few years.Some of the new features seem a bit pointless but are there just to add a bit of realism / flavour so they don't bother me. I do wish they'd add some brand new major features rather than just shuffle things around which makes it look like a lot has changed... I honestly believe a feature such as Academy management - working your way up from the U18s or U23s to be offered jobs elsewhere or at your own club would be an amazing new feature for next year, although Miles doesn't think highly of the suggestion. Something new and fresh like that could really give the game's dedicated fanbase something to be excited about rather than having to get excited over the fact that they've added 'data analysts' which are there for a bit of realism.

												This game is freak'n awesome IF you like this type of thing!  It definitely will improve your overall soccer knowledge, situational awareness and understanding.  This game can be hard and VERY complex if you choose it to be... very indepth.  Basically you manage or delegate ALL aspects of any soccer team you choose or create.  I mean EVERYTHING!  You manage the team, training, match days, farm team, team academy, players, press conferences, media, transfers, scouting, board and ruling body, business aspects, I even designed my Italian suit I wear on the sidelines on match days.  It is fun, if you like turn based, day by day managing... hell, this game should be required participation for ALL corperate America managers and wanna-be's.  YOU must make the hard decisions:  blow sunshine up player and staff asses, transfers, cuts, injuries, staff hiring and philosophy, etc.  A VERY nice change of pace when you want to fantasize.How many times have YOU said that coach/manager is an idiot and this is how I would do it... well, get in the chair and lets see how YOU would do it!!

												Because of the negative reviews, I didn't plan on buying FM17 and only did when I got bit by the bug to try it this March.  It feels like everyone's review sounds like they're describing FM14 through FM16--and those negative reviews are accurate for those games--but my experience of FM17 so far has been pleasant enough.  While many things are still the same, the radical interface design has freshened up the place a bit.  So far, I haven't been hampered by the overly sensitive morale issues or 80th minute lead collapses people claim are all over the place and have been in previous iterations.  If you're thinking about buying this game, I'd say the user reviews are a backlash of how hard the series has become in previous years but I would say that I'm enjoying this version just fine and would recommend it if you're on the fence about it.

												Dota 2 is unlike any other game Iâve ever played, both in its nature and history. It started off as a StarCraft mod popular enough to be ported to Warcraft 3, which then exploded into a kaleidoscope of player-made variants and eventually coalesced again into a single entity titled Defense of the Ancients Allstars. There is no single author of Dota, though all the anonymous contributors whoâve made it what it is have come from the community that first started playing the mods. As such, Dota is the very definition of grassroots game development. The idea of a game made by the people for the people, as a certain American president might put it, fills me with a particularly warm and fuzzy sensation.			"

												I'm so glad that i did not buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥.I'w been playin FM2011,on-of, for last 6 years ( i know) and this â¥â¥â¥â¥ has not change in that time at all.Still twichi as â¥â¥â¥â¥, tactics overcomplicated, and players made of glass if you know what i mean.I'W played FM since the first came out in 2005 i belive, and once i thout it was the best game in the world, now its not ewen in the top 20.if you really like FM games than buy fm 2016 from youre friend its basicly 99% the same thing.

												A definite game engine improvement over past versions, and while the players within the game are simply a database update, the whole game runs far smoother and more elegantly than previous versions. The series is back on track and will be one of those that you just have to play a little bit longer to see what the next match brings.			"

LOVED FM16, ITS BASICALLY EXACTLY THE SAME BUT WITH NO CONSISTANCY IN RESULTS, HONESTLY REGRET SPENDING SO MUCH MONEY FOR THIS GAME AND IM SOMEONE WHO CONSTANTLY PLAYS THIS GAME! tHE HIGHLIGHTS ARE SO UNREALISTIC SOMETIMES AND REALLY POOR QUALITY, JUST SEEMS A LIKE OF IDEAS IN CREATING THE GAME! IM WINNING 3 - 1 WITH 2 MINUTES TO GO AND I SOMEHOW LOSE 4 - 3, MANCHESTER CITY ARE IN THE RELEGATION ZONE, ITS JUST ALL TERRIBLE! I WILL BE DEMANDING A REFUND FOR THIS GAME AS IT HAS NO QUALITY OR ENJOYMENT TO IT! I REALLY DO NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING THIS GAME, IT WILL BE ONE  OF THE WORST DECSIONS YOU MAKE! GO AND BUY FIFA OR SOMETHING ELSE, THEY ARE BOTH FULL OF BS BUT AT LEAST FIFA YOU CAN PLAY IT AND HAVE A LITTLE MORE CONTROL OF THE BS!

												Love the game, always love FM, only thing thats a little disappointing is data analysts and sports scientists dont seem to do anything, if they were brought into the game more that'd be great.I'd also like to see other specialist staff, that are quite rare like fitness specialists, tactical genius coaches, eagle eyed scouts or miracle wonder doctors that could be hired that give your team an extra edge (providing they dont automatically go straight to top clubs). id love to have kit changes too and get a say in which are picked, same with sponsorship deals (this could be something you leave to the chairman or DoF to speed up the game).An option for the loan deals to already be in place or not would be good too, i nearly always either want to sell or want to use players who are already tied down to loan deals  at the start of the game and realistically lots of these deals wouldnt be made with a new manager coming in.

												(Don't) Believe the hype!Every November, we say goodbye.We say goodbye to Bognor Regis, who we had to Google to find out where on Earth they played. We say goodbye to the Hall of Fame, that proudly displays Sandy Morley in the top six spots. We say goodbye to Oscar Sanchez Morales, who only stayed for a year before moving to Man City, but taught us everything we know about playing a libero in a 5-2-3. We say goodbye to tactics we've honed and polished and turned into guaranteed winners from the Indonesian amateur leagues to El Classico.And we step out into the great, hard unknown. Everything we knew has changed. It hurts a little bit. We write a review lambasting the lack of a comfort zone. We forget about it, sink a thousand hours in, and next time November rolls around, we complain again that '18 just isn't as good as '17.This is a great game. If you like FM you will like FM17. It might take a while to get used to, sure, but give it time and I bet my bottom dollar you've got your money's worth within the month.			"

												As good as FM17 is, I feel it's always 1 step forward and 2 steps back in regards to the yearly release schedule that SI are going for. There is a lot of fluff that has been introduced, which wouldn't be that bad, but there's still bugs in the game that have been there for at least 3 years. The tactics still need a complete overhaul, they're still too simple and you can't get your team to play the way you want them to. A return to the sliders of old would be a great thing, I understand that it's harder nowadays because of the 3d match engine, but I would certainly pay for a game with more tactical depth with only a 2d mode than the way it is today.7/10.

												This is the first football manager I've played since FM14 and quite a bit has changed. Whilst some things like the social feed are a little unpolished, the game is very accessible overall. On previous versions I'd always download a tactic off the internet and just use that but I've taken the time to play with the system and gotten a few things that work. Whilst I'm not the best tactician in the world the advice from your coaching staff is very helpful.The game is well worth buying and is a real time sink.			"

												I get why it has negative reviews on steam, as at face value it hasn't changed a lot from the previous years. But the new changes are good, although quite small, they do improve the game a lot in my opinion.This has been my favourite version since 2012, so I'm happy. I do think the way you interact with media needs a huge overhaul, it's tedious atm. I think overachieving with a team should mean more. I feel that the media could create stories and reward good play, and criticise bad. I just feel there's loads they could do with it.Don't expect a huge changel, but do expect a good solid version of FM.			"

												FM 17 is a great game in the series.  They have ironed out the problems of 2016 and really given a complete game this time.  I think they need to just extend 2017 with a yearly update and not bring out the same game with a slightly better game engine for the next one however.			"

Im currently using fm16 tactics which work fine so the tactics havent changed. the match engine is only slightly improved but only in minor areas. Its clear that football manager has no real competition, which is made abundantly clear by the fact they can rip off there loyal fans and supporters by selling them last years game at the price of a new game!

												Most people have guilty pleasures, for some it will be reality TV, the others may be having a smoke on a night out, me, I am absolutely in love with the Football Manager series. I originally started playing the series way back in 2001 when the main developer team worked on Championship Manager. After a few years, Eidos and Sports Interactive split in 2005 and a new franchise was born, Football Manager. The developer team was headed up by a lot of the core people who worked on the Championship Manager series, and shortly after the birth of Football Manager, Championship Manager slowly disappeared from the scene. For those who are not familiar with the franchise, the game is essentially a glorified spreadsheet, as are most simulator games. You take charge of a football club (read soccer club) and manage all aspects of it, from working on your teamâs tactics, to contracts and wages of your players to political elements such as this year's Brexit campaign. The game is not to be confused with Fifa, where you actually control the players on the pitch yourself; you do not do that in Football Manager, you are the manager, you manage the players. We have had a new release of Football Manager on a yearly basis and each year comes jampacked full of improvements and changes from the previous iteration. 2017 is no different. The first major improvement is a graphical one. The game has never been well known for the realistic graphics engine that we see in the likes of FIFA or NBA, heck, the game only got a 3D engine in 2009. Before then you used to play the matches out with 2D circles running around the pitch. How I managed to get so engrossed in these matches and jumping out my seat is beyond me...The improvements this year add new lighting and shadow effects, to the very small details of the grass getting a more polished look. The players on the pitch also have 1500 new motion captured animations which make them move more fluidly. With that being said, some of the animations still look a little strange but there are definite improvements from previous installments. The addition of a new camera angle means you get to get up close and personal with all of the action on the field too. A small change that people who donât really follow football will notice, is the inclusion of the Magic Spray. Whenever there is a free kick, the referee will mark out where the ball needs to be placed, and where the defending wall can stand. Itâs only a small change, but it adds to the realism to the gameâs match engine. Pre-match presentations are something that we see all the time at actual football games, whether it be players emerging from the tunnel, and line ups for national anthems or the pre-match handshake. We also get the inclusion of a the rule changes to football too, such as one player may kick the game off, rather than 2, an injured player can be treated on the pitch if the offending player was punished with a card, and last man red cards will now not automatically result in a red card. These are the main in match changes that youâll probably notice more than anything, but a whole host of other changes have taken place out side of the match screen, and on the âInboxâ screen. Match analysis is a key to any sucess story in Football Manager, and with the cooperation of STATS and Sports Interactive, you have more information at your finger tips than youâll ever need. The UI has also had a revamp to make layouts and menu options much more concise and compact, I think a lot of this has to do with the move to tablet devices but it is still clear and easy to navigate on PC. The game includes a handy system that will highlight all of the key changes to the UI for you compared to the last game in the series which is a welcome addition to any hardcore fans out there who donât want a full tutorial experience. The main thing about Football Manager that I love the most, is that the world you play in becomes your own little universe. You can take a minnow from the lowest league in your country and turn them into champions of the world. You can find a young teenager in a youth team, and nurture them into the next Lionel Messi, or Cristiano Ronaldo. Your game will keep evolving and changing, whether you play just for one season, or you are playing in your hundredth season, no game will ever be the same. You can play Football Manager as either a completely hardcore nuthead and delve straight in at the deep end with thoughtful tactical processes, training regimes and scouting networks, or you can play a much more watered down version of the game, that aids newer players in learning the ropes a bit. This is ideal for people who canât commit as much time to the game, but still want to get the experience out of it. This âwatered downâ version will allow players to complete a season in an evenings worth of time, whilst the full blown version will probably take upwards of ten hours to complete a season. Iâve actually been known to reach the end of a pre-season and managed to wrack up eight hours of playing time just because of the amount of detail you can go into. Meticulously planning your player transfers, budgeting each and everyone of your playerâs contract renewals, it all takes up time, but the more time you put in, the bigger reward youâll get at the end. From reading the reviews on the Steam page, you will probably see that the game is âMostly negativeâ; which completely and utterly astounds me. After playing for almost 24 hours now, I have only good things to say about this game. Yes you could very easily play the last version of the game and still have just as much fun, but this version of Football Manager is ten times better than the last, and is a fully immersive football management simulator game. I mean, the game is the third most popular game on Steam, beating the likes of Civ VI, Team Fortress 2 and GTA V. This is a behemoth of a game franchise and should be experienced by anyone who follows football in any manner. I started playing the game with only a fleeting interest in football, and now it is one of the most important aspects of my life. Football Manager is not only a game, it is a factor in so many peopleâs lives whether it be good or bad reasons. The bad mainly being the game has been cited in 35 divorce casesâ¦ I can wholeheartedly recommend Football Manager 2017 at full price for any football fan out there.			"

												DO NOT buy this installment. Enough is enough. SI needs to realize they have a playerbase that they need to start respecting.As they develop more and more features for casual play, trying to expand their sales, because they know we'll buy it every year regardless of what they do, it's gone to far. I'll spare a quick line for the positives - the match engine seems to have improved and they've done a good job with the visuals. And now onto why I think they've gone too far - this game crashes. A lot. 16 used to crash a lot, but I've been playing this for half a day and I've lost count of the amount of times its crashed as I tab out while its simming a match. Or just crashed as I'm loading. Yes, yes, beta. But we all know unless they're hit with a serious sales dip, they'll just spend their time developing more casual modes instead of fixing bugs. As they've done for years, while we've eaten up anything they do. The UI is getting more and more cluttered and there are questionable decisions on changing things that never were a problem and creating new problems. Until SI decides to work for their loyal customers, who still represent the vast majority of people buying it, I highly recommend avoiding my mistake and buying yet another one. At least not until they stop crashing so â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ much.			"

												Have to say there's still a significant amount of bugs remaining very close to release making this one of the least reliable football manager games of recent years - however still in pre-release so it's possible they've got a day 1 patch to fix these.Most of the new features this year revolve around userability upgrades and having the extra information and suggestions come into the inbox is a nice touch but applying changes here doesn't seem to reliablity apply to the team - nothing this year feels that revolutionary in the game design.The bugs that seem to be present in every football manager game are still here - I'm on 12th training injury of the season despite being on a low workload and only 8 games in.The 3D match engine looks a little nicer and is a little more fluid than before but it's not worth the Â£35 on it's own - get yourself 2016 or 2015 for half the price and find an updated league. SI need to do some serious work on this game to make it worth your money.That said - this is still football manager, there's still a unique charm to this games that it's difficult to get anywhere else, it's just a shame that this years iteration feels like a step backwards.

												The amount of negativity this game has accumulated is crazy. I'm not going to stand here and tell you guys it is super innovative or ground-breaking stuff but it appears some people have forgotten a simple fact. Football Manager 2017 is still the best football management simulator out there by a country mile. If what you want is a well built management game, I don't see too many issues with this. I suppose I'll quickly get the problems I do agree with out of the way first. The price is too high considering how little innovation there is. Â£34.99 is asking a lot when the game is not all that different from FM16. Add the extra Â£3.99 for the in game editor too and it has to be said, S.I might be pushing their luck a little. On top of this I will also concede that the game needs refining in places. There's silly little things which should just not be a problem which are. For example, if you sign a player who can't get a work permit and then try to loan him out, it's not uncommon for the player to then complain that they feel they are too good to be loaned out. Clearly in this case you should be able to talk to the player and explain to him that he needs to get a work permit elsewhere. However, this is a little bug which can be irritating at worst. It does not destroy the experience although I will admit I also feel it's something that S.I should patch ASAP (which I suspect they won't).With that out of the way, let's address the two things I'm sick of reading. FIrst of all, being bad at the game does not make the game bad. The amount of times I've read 'I CONCEDED IN THE 90TH MINUTE AFTER DOMINATING THE GAME THIS SUX WTF' is ridiculous. That happens in football, you know? Look at Burnley vs Liverpool this season. Liverpool were the better team in every description and yet Burnley took a 2-0 win. It's frustrating but not unrealistic necessarily. Also, if this is happening every game it's probably a tactical fault. Drop off, update your player instructions. If you're just sitting there then what do expect? No game is won by not doing anything. The second big thing is that people claim the game engine is identical to last year. I can't say I agree. I've seen a huge range of new goal types such as players actually bothering to pass across the box which just weren't present previously (at least not often anyway). Sure, players do stupid stuff from time to time but that's simply replicating real life. Only a few games ago I had my keeper miss hit a long kick straight to their striker for an open goal. Is that BS that hasn't been improved from last year? No, it's a individual error that can happen to anyone. Green's OG in the World Cup? Gerrard's slip? Terry's penalty? Errors happen and the game represents this well. Just because it gets you angry doesn't mean FM's doing anything wrong.All in all then I'd say this. Should you buy this for Â£34.99? Only if you're a huge fan of RECENT TITLES. I say recent titles because it's very similar to them but not at all like games from years back. For the average guy I'd say wait for a sale which drops it down to at least Â£24.99 or lower. It's still a fun game which does a competent job of simulating football management as a whole. It can be a little complicated and it certainly isn't for everyone, but I still believe FM17 is a fair game at the very least.			"

IntroductionProbably what you expect from a game with yearly entries. No huge differences, but enough to make it worth.In detailToo many negative reviews for the wrong reasons. I totally disagree.Pros+ Substantial visual updates+ Players witll act more like actual human beings during the game+ Appealing Interface, which makes the game playable without skins+ More realistic negotiations and interraction with players, board, other teamsCons- Better graphics mean laggy game for low end PCs. Even on high end PCs, forget multitasking- Price is high considering the new additions of this entryConcluding, it's a great game, and if you have the funds, go for it. Last FM i played was FM15, and i see a substantial difference. Money won't be missed7/101. Dont touch it even if it's on the house [0-3 / 10].] 2. If you are bored of every other game [3-5 / 10]. 3. Grab it whenever it's on sale (or pay the full price if you are wealthy enough) [6-8] 4. Must Have [9-10 / 10]			"

												Ii believe this is a good game. I have played the previous three FM titles and have been thouroughly impressed with all three as bad and as plain and similar it is to last years doesnt bother me. Its hard to make a football management game different every year. And it is still better than most if not all of the competiton. I do however admit that the game negine and the ai are basically useless. Especially keepers. And Defenders. To be fair strikers make fairly intelligent runs and wingers and central midfielders are fairly accurate with their balls to find them.Overall I enjoy the game and would reccomend you buy it if you enjoy the series, it still has a challenge and has the unpredictability i love from actuall football.

												I have bought FM for the last few years straight because I enjoy it but also because I can afford to do so. There is no doubt that if you love the idea of managing a team with all the myriad problems and challenges it brings then FM is without peer. A serious alternative might well be the driver for revolutionary change - but, as we have seen in other areas, this may not necessarily be a good thing. For now, this is the only game in town but if the annual outlay was a struggle I would just use community mods and updates to keep an older version of the game running.I don't mind the new social media aspects of the game but, like the Press interviews and player interaction, they quickly become formulaic - although I have picked up some fresh talent to scout from it. The game's jewel in the crown for me - and what makes this game such an  enticing challenge - is still the unfathomable dark heart of FM's match engine.  Some reviewers have slated its unrealistic scorelines or tactical glitches but any week's real world results will always throw up its fair share of ""bugger me, there's no way I thought Leeds would go out of the FA Cup to a non-league side"" incidents. I have played a lot of chess in years gone by to quite a decent level and I don't feel its an overstatement to see FM's innate complexity and the interaction of so many variables as similar in some ways. With a few community downloads (logos, DF11 facepacks and skins), it can also look how you want it.While I do  think the series is due for a bit of a makeover (and I am shallow enough to want the match graphics to be a part of that!), I wouldn't want anything which is so clearly not broken 'overfixed'. If you won't miss the money and you are patient enough for the game's learning curve it's definitely worth buying. If the cash is an issue hold out with a previous version and update it. "

												I'm still holding on to the hope that they can bring the match engine back closer to the quality of fm 2015. There are just way to many kinks in this one. Penalties are very hard to convert while crosses are impossible to defend against (just get a good target man and two good wingers and you can upset any opposing team). My chances of converting a cross is actually much higher compared to penalties. Defensive midfielders are almost always guaranteed to get carded everygame and teams that get stuck in injure their opponents often while conceding far too few fouls.Regardless, I still like this game because of then w features, but the match engine is what's supposed to make or break this game. I hope they can find a way to finally fix it on the official release.			"

												Football manager is back in all it's glory. But not in the usual ""overhaul everything way"". Yes the new 3-D match engine is very noticeable and there are slight tweeks to the whole transfer process. But it is a game that really rewards someone who pays attention to detail, (i.e player body language) along with other mutilple excellent marginal changes. If you want to blast through the game, buy the tocuh version, which offers a more pick up and play aspect. But if you want to take the time to craft a beautiful team, make your chosen club a collosial football empire,  (or have no friends like myself lol) get the full version and immerse yourself into the world of professional football :)			"

												I'm writing this review because this game is really worth to write it, to buy it and you play it all day long. And so you know it i've been playing FM for quite a while so i'm not in a hype train.Pros:- New engine looks gorgeus but it has some issues which i will talk about in the Cons but overall they did a nice work, in my opinion the game is more fluent and more enjoyable. Full Backs/Wing Backs won't get many assists from crosses anymore and i don't why do people complain about goals from crosses. I'm getting goals from long range, dribbles in 1 on 2 or 1 on 1 against defenders, crosses into headers, corners, freekicks ... i mean if you use tactics that exploit flanks and you don't use work ball into box all they're allowed to do is crossing.- In my point of view, goalkeepers acts more natural allowing not to concede many goals which was difficult last year they simply wouldn't react to easy balls and sometimes they would make world class saves non-stop even being low rating. Annoying right?  (i'm about 20 games in January and i've got 4 conceded goals in a major league)- They didn't change the UI neither the Tactics Interface which i like personally, you can go back and rearrange old tactics easily and adapt to the updated squads.- Making your life easier to the previous ""pro"", now you got a sort of ""updated"" list/resume from your scouts & staff that allows you to quickly sign future world class players/renew contracts/players you should sign depending where you're lacking depth in your squad/replacing ""old"" players that probably are near retirement/ and much more ... all of this by just pressing an ""arrow"" that will apply and do what they adviced you. Of course you can quickly get into the players interface/stats easily so you can have a look, all by clicking their names like usual.- A lot from FM wasn't changed, the good things, the complicated things, stuff that we had to learn last year which were needed to improve but since this year it wasn't needed an improvement they didn't change it. And it's true, don't change what is good, there's no need, we would have to relearn all of it again which saved me time.Cons:- The issues about the engine: Players still float/moonwalk to reach some headers, the goalkeepers were fixed but there's still room for improvement with patches so it's not that bad of a ""Con"".- Even doe some players from another clubs are not doing that great, sometimes they tend to over perform in UCL matches, i mean yeah sure some players in real life play better under pressure of big matches but this wasn't the case. I got curious about some performances vs my club and i went to check their performances in their league/cup/UCL club matches. They didn't perform any good vs anyone except my club. And no it's not the tactic that was bad, they just tended to score their first goal or second of the season ... out of nowhere which was weird. 3 players did that.- Some players were buffed from last year which was normal if they did perfom well, but what was weird it was that, even doe in real life they want/wanted to stay at their current club, they tend to ask to leave the club, wanting to move on right in the 1st-2nd week. Last year that would happen only if you would under perform in pre-season which is alright or if you were already 1-2 seasons in which is also normal but not straight away, as soon as you start playing some may ask to leave.Conclusion:-The Pros are way stronger this year but there's room for improvement, yes there's some issues with the new engine but patches can fix them which i won't complain about. I like the game now and i probably will like it more over time. I recommend it to previous years players and newcomers. Don't complain about the price because there's a lot of people working on the game like scouts/data analysts and so on, no need to be an â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥I've got no life now ... thanks ... 21hrs in 3 days ...8/10			"

												I didn't play Football Manager 2016, so many of the complaints I've seen others make about it lacking change since then are not things I have noticed. Last game that I played was Football Manager 2015.It's Football Manager, so it is always going to follow the same basic format, the usual tried and tested features and layout are back. The interface and some of it's functionality has improved since FM15, there were annoying bugs, particularly with things like setting custom view profiles causing columns to disappear and refuse to display and almost all players being completely unrealisitc with their demans of game time(a first team player being in 70% of matches and yet screaming that he doesn't get enough match starts for example). There were numerous other little buggy annoyances that plagued the game but are too small to merit going into.I am only 28 hours in with FM17 but I can gladly report that the majoirty of interface bugs seem to be removed, though when mousing over the information icon of a player the tooltip that pops up will still sometimes bug and stay there until you click the same icon again and move away from it; a bug that has been in every recent version I have played(FM 13, 14, 15).The players also do seem to be less whiny so far, when they do whine they are much more reasonable. The key and first team players that I've had complain so far were happy as long as they started in ~50% of the matches during the promise interval and most seem content not to complain so long as I give them at least that many starts. I've not had any rotation/backup players complain yet.All in all the game so far seems to be a good version of the series and less buggy than the previous versions I've tried. Still what people have commented on is true, it's not going to be radically different and blow you away; it's a Football Management sim afterall they can only innovate so much. The AI of opposition managers could still do with improving as it does still seem easy to get on long winning streaks as long as you have a strong tactic and aren't vastly out-skilled with opposition players; the majority of AI managers don't seem to use anything resembling complex tactics.

												It's fine. There are ever only marginal improvements in yearly release sports games, and FM 17 does that. You could easily skip this year, but buying it won't be a letdown either. If you're looking for HUGE changes, you'll need to wait 3-5 years between releases. That said, it's FM game, and it does FM stuff, with some recent tweaks and updates. Outside of the fact that it's still doesn't represent how central Ronaldo/Messi are to their clubs (or their goalscoring prowess) I have few complaints.			"

												I have just logged a full weeks worth of play. It doesn't seem like it but then it never does.The hours fly by the trophys start to stack up.The game is more challenging which is great, there are still niggles with it, the press conferences are still dull and repetitive and other teams are really into tapping up my players but i do not appear to be able to reciprocate despite being (theoretically) on a par with those teams.However I find the training and development part seems to have gotten better, I am able to bring promising prospects much further than in previous editions.Overall, as nearly every year an A.

												Football manager is back in all it's glory. But not in the usual ""overhaul everything way"". Yes the new 3-D match engine is very noticeable and there are slight tweeks to the whole transfer process. But it is a game that really rewards someone who pays attention to detail, (i.e player body language) along with other mutilple excellent marginal changes. If you want to blast through the game, buy the tocuh version, which offers a more pick up and play aspect. But if you want to take the time to craft a beautiful team, make your chosen club a collosial football empire,  (or have no friends like myself lol) get the full version and immerse yourself into the world of professional football :)			"

												I'm writing this review because this game is really worth to write it, to buy it and you play it all day long. And so you know it i've been playing FM for quite a while so i'm not in a hype train.Pros:- New engine looks gorgeus but it has some issues which i will talk about in the Cons but overall they did a nice work, in my opinion the game is more fluent and more enjoyable. Full Backs/Wing Backs won't get many assists from crosses anymore and i don't why do people complain about goals from crosses. I'm getting goals from long range, dribbles in 1 on 2 or 1 on 1 against defenders, crosses into headers, corners, freekicks ... i mean if you use tactics that exploit flanks and you don't use work ball into box all they're allowed to do is crossing.- In my point of view, goalkeepers acts more natural allowing not to concede many goals which was difficult last year they simply wouldn't react to easy balls and sometimes they would make world class saves non-stop even being low rating. Annoying right?  (i'm about 20 games in January and i've got 4 conceded goals in a major league)- They didn't change the UI neither the Tactics Interface which i like personally, you can go back and rearrange old tactics easily and adapt to the updated squads.- Making your life easier to the previous ""pro"", now you got a sort of ""updated"" list/resume from your scouts & staff that allows you to quickly sign future world class players/renew contracts/players you should sign depending where you're lacking depth in your squad/replacing ""old"" players that probably are near retirement/ and much more ... all of this by just pressing an ""arrow"" that will apply and do what they adviced you. Of course you can quickly get into the players interface/stats easily so you can have a look, all by clicking their names like usual.- A lot from FM wasn't changed, the good things, the complicated things, stuff that we had to learn last year which were needed to improve but since this year it wasn't needed an improvement they didn't change it. And it's true, don't change what is good, there's no need, we would have to relearn all of it again which saved me time.Cons:- The issues about the engine: Players still float/moonwalk to reach some headers, the goalkeepers were fixed but there's still room for improvement with patches so it's not that bad of a ""Con"".- Even doe some players from another clubs are not doing that great, sometimes they tend to over perform in UCL matches, i mean yeah sure some players in real life play better under pressure of big matches but this wasn't the case. I got curious about some performances vs my club and i went to check their performances in their league/cup/UCL club matches. They didn't perform any good vs anyone except my club. And no it's not the tactic that was bad, they just tended to score their first goal or second of the season ... out of nowhere which was weird. 3 players did that.- Some players were buffed from last year which was normal if they did perfom well, but what was weird it was that, even doe in real life they want/wanted to stay at their current club, they tend to ask to leave the club, wanting to move on right in the 1st-2nd week. Last year that would happen only if you would under perform in pre-season which is alright or if you were already 1-2 seasons in which is also normal but not straight away, as soon as you start playing some may ask to leave.Conclusion:-The Pros are way stronger this year but there's room for improvement, yes there's some issues with the new engine but patches can fix them which i won't complain about. I like the game now and i probably will like it more over time. I recommend it to previous years players and newcomers. Don't complain about the price because there's a lot of people working on the game like scouts/data analysts and so on, no need to be an â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥I've got no life now ... thanks ... 21hrs in 3 days ...8/10			"

												Good game, a few tweaks and updates from last year to make the game more immersive. Love the new stats addition that has replaced the prozone this year. Still in pre-season of my Plymouth Argyle save so it's early doors. I'm sure there will be lots more to discover as I get more and more into the game. Love the new gigahertz boost or whatever it is. But the game has been made to run much quicker. No more waiting ten minutes for the game to save or 'continue'.			"

												An improvement on last year bar the Regen faces which are straight up terrifying this year. As addictive as ever and has incredible replay value. Easily the best Â£35 I spend a year. In terms of the amount of play time I get out of it it's an absolute steal!TLDR - Fantastic game well worth the price tag.			"

												I can't recommend for people that already have fm16. But if you don't have it, i think its a good game. Not a perfect one obviously but it keeps me entertained when I played it. And that's what's important to me. And no, I'm not a veteran fm player, merely a casul at this series. "

												I played FM 2014 for over 1000 hours and I thought that it could be better in FM 2017 BUT IT IS NOT. I can not believe that that I could selll Paco Alacacer in 55M??? Some setting of prices of players are ridiculous. Also, DOES THE GAME HAVE ANY CHANGE??? I cannot see any difference between FM 2014 and FM 2017, besides the different database fo players. Can you may any any any change, SI Game? This bring me so suck! I am Chinese, and I spend 180 RMB (30 USD) in the new FM 2017 only seeing a version with setting which is the same and that in three years ago and a relatively new database with even less authorization. Can you be just spend a little more money on the faces of players? Would you be more happy seeing the black heads of players? FM 2014 bring me good memory, also because it is released three years ago. THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE AFTER THREE YEARS!!! It is a good game three years ago, but there are too many chages in this society in three years. I am very ""HONORED"" to see a game with no real change besides the database after three years. And it sells for 180 RMB just for a change of name FROM 14 TO 17! I do not want to talk about the language, and I am NOT WE NEED CHINESE party. I study in an American university and I can understand English well. I do not need Chinese version. However, the terrible settings and minor change is enough for me to give a disapproval.			"

												I buy this game every year.  Brilliantly deep, requires you to think about what you're doing tactically, and consider the strengths and weaknesses of individual players when developing your plan for a match.  If you keep doing the same thing tactically, teams will figure out how to play against you, making games interesting even if you're clearly superior from a talent standpoint.Love it.			"
