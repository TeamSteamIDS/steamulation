												let me give you a proper review of the game i played it since closed beta so most of the people praising it are players who played it before steam and spend TONS of money on it and they're trying to sugercoat the game so gain more players so they can curse at you and humiliate you also call you noob.PLEASE READ IT ITS A WARNING ABOUT THE GAME.pro:-great gameplay.-costumization.-different dunks.-teamwork required.-scoring feels satisfying.cons--HEAVILY p2w (like seriously check the cards your can obtain all cards wich are gold are only obtainable through cash those cards can be upgraded more than 10 times) and don't forget the +10 stats on clothing wich is also only available for cash (with item balls) only free players can only have +5 stats on a clothing piece i calulated the stats you could earn with cash and with ingame money free players can get to +35 on 1 stat paying players can get over +65.-HIGLY toxic playerbase don't get fooled by the rookie server the pro server is swarming with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s bragging that they spend the most money in the game.-usseless gm's they ban you if you say bad stuff about the game i already had a warning message from a gm.-relies highly on ping for the pf and C position.-players posting the most dumbest things on the forums wich has nothing to do with the game its almost as bad as facebook.-pf's are highly overpowered they can shoot 3's like a sg, shoot 2's like a sf,dunk like a pf and rebound like a C and pf's has a skill that makes C's completly usseless.-C's are HIGHLY underpowered DO NOT!!!!! take that position they got almost completly usseless cause of pf's. -mostly foreigners good luck finding english players.-idiotic players who keeps wanting an asia server even tough there is 2 asain versions  of the game already.-playerbase is next to none before it came to steam and there is a good reason for that.-prepare to get kicked out alot. -special characters that is only obtainable with cash gaining special atributes.-players who have vip cannot be kicked in fact vip players can kick the host.-most events require cash-cash clothing so big it litteraly blocks your view of your character.-special characters have a bigger hitbox-tons of exploits like when you playing as a C or PF most of the time you needs to split into 2 to win and either way you get the blame.reason the game is so p2w is because its following the taiwan version of the game the korean version is 10X better and not p2w at all. if it din't have all those cons the game could have been so much better this is the REAL review of the game from a player who played it for 6-5 monthsP.S. don't listen to uncle he got the worst excuses like you don't get the timing right like ♥♥♥♥ing seriously? i jumped the same time as the opponent did get your eyes checked.and don't listen that he never paid anything because he would call it ""DONATORS"" that match proved my point more than ever.

												First time I felt the need to write a review.  This game is truly satisfying if you're a competition junky. You don't even have to like sport games to enjoy this game.  The gameplay and game mechanics all work well, untill that point where you hit level 24. As a beginner, I started out playing against other noobs and various pro players that had their smurf accounts in the rookie/major league. I had some epic losses, epic victories, various intense close point games that went into second overtime. Eventually, I managed to get to level 25 with a 76% win percentage overall, I felt like a solid player that played his role ( PF ) well. In good matches, I'd block about every shot, bad matches I'd let a few slide.   All the fun in the game stopped though when I entered the  Pro League.Match after match, you get to play against level 50 characters that not only have the most ridiculous skills that you could think, they also have so much experience that not in another 1000 matches could you hope to destroy them. They also have, in almost EVERY case, dropped over 200-300 euros on cash shop roulette style items that grant bonus stats, cards and card upgrades that grant..bonus stats, extra skill slots, etc.  You name it.So in quick summary. You might love the game in the beginning, you might think you're a genius rookie player destroying the alt characters of pros. But once you actually get to the pro league, prepare to bend over and take it, over and over again untill you yourself are level 44-50 and have unlocked all the skills + slots. Surely by that time, you would also have dropped atleast 60 euros on the game.			"

												Bear with me as this is my first game review on Steam:Pros:- Great customization (Skills, Freestyle variability, Clothing, Stat allocation)- Requires teamwork (Heavy)- Crew matches (Like GvG in MMORPGs)- Easy to pick up, Hard to masterCons:- Community can be toxic (Will explain more later)- You can pay for stats- Fluid gameplay relies heavily on latency (ping)Freestyle2 is a great Multiplayer Online 3v3 Streetball game that pleases my thirst for basketball games.It is very easy to pick up (You only use direction keys + 4 basic keys + 2 or 3 more for specific skills),but hard to master.It relies moderately on basketball knowledge, such as actual basketball tactics like Pick and Roll, which can be executed in the right situation. To win, you will have to try your best to fulfill your one of five (C, PF, SF, SG, PG) position's purpose.Positions and their roles are generalized in FreeStyle2, although adventurous stat allocation may lead to fun and creative plays (like improving 3 pointers success rate on C or PFs). C: Rebounding and blocking, setting up plays under the paintPF: Similar to C, but takes an offensive roleSF: All-rounder (Dunk, rebound, middle jumper, 3s)SG: Also an all-rounder with heavier emphasis on 3sPG: Playmaker (Passing and loose ball grabbing)Playing the position that fits you and doing it right comes with a great rewarding feeling.Also, there are many team compositions which are strong, but you will run into hell lot of weird ones online (Triple Cs)If you aren't good at what your position is supposed to be doing by Major (past level 11), you will most likely be dealt with offensive words, telling you that you suck and that you should quit.The playerbase isn't large enough to have the greatest matchmaking system and tiers - and this is why sometimes you will face teams that will totally♥♥♥♥♥♥on your face. Knowing your position and having individual skills is very important in this game and when a single teammate is not pulling their own weight, it shows definitely. I highly suggest trying each of the 5 positions before moving onto Major (level 11+)You can pay for extra stats (btw you can also do this for free, but not as much). Does it help? Yeah, I guess.Does it win games? Maybe - it makes minimal difference.Why is that?Let's say a player purchased items and also obtained cards to improve his 3 pointers.If you are guarding him perfectly, he won't score any 3 pointers.If you don't and give him open shots on 3s, you should really blame yourself.Teamwork (Strategy, Individual talent, knowing how each other reacts in certain situations) is much much much much holy freaking so much more important and impactful than stats.Gamekiss will be adding controller support very soon, and I am so excited for that!Give this game a try. If you like working as a team and enjoy basketball in general, you will love it!			"

												Bear in mind that this review comes from a person who used to play Freestyle 1 a lot of years ago. I've played in Thailand servers, in Gamekiss (NA) servers, in 4Game (Russian) servers and my country always had a big community in this game because we are big on basketball. There will be a lot of comparingBefore my rant, remember: I HATE BASKETBALL.Yes, I hate basketball. I've played this game for so long (the Freestyle 1 version) even though I hate basketball. You know why? Because this game is super fun even if you don't know anything about basketball. There is constant action, it's super rewarding to block, rebound and when you hit a 3-pointer, it's the best feeling ever.Freestyle 1 was actually rather bad.It was full P2W, clothes that give attributes were all costing money, the OP moves that were difficult to block were all expensive and you HAD to buy them with real life money. There were serveral exploits like when you receive a pass, you get a speedboost. Exploiting that, you could always step back faster than your opponent and make yourself unblockable. Level system was awful, you only got your real position at level 15 and the grind to 45 (max level) was like the whole game. High level people could do anything and everything so you had to block them every time because they would hit every shot. You know why that was awful? That's right, the speed boost exploit.Freestyle 2 possibly improves every mechanic that existsted in FSSB1. Skills costs like 3k at the start, meanwhile you get like 50k points at the start by registering, eliminating the grinding element of the game. Freestyles (Skills that only makes your shot/dunk different, making it harder to be blocked) can now be used only once or twice per game because you have to meet the requirements to do them. However, once you do them, it's garanteed points, so I think that's a nice touch. You choose freestyles on your own, instead of them spinning in the exact same order for the whole game. Music is constantly playing in game, making you feel in action. Also, the soundtrack makes you super pumped, while you can also configure it FSSB1 Games were all the same: PFs/Cs rebound, pass it to SGs and they shoot 3points OR PFs just dunking and you can't block them because they have paid for the awesome almost unblockable dunks. In FSSB2, or at least in early stages of FSSB2, it won't be like this. SGs can be blocked easily, there are way more rebound patterns for rebounders to learn, etc. Bigger skill variety Can be played with a controller. I haven't tried it yet, but I think it might be really fun Awesome rewarding system, making you feel progressing, most daily quests  aren't considered grinding and there are constant events. You also constantly get items and a lot of points, also making the game not P2W EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE BASKETBALL, YOU WILL ENJOY THIS GAME It's super rewarding. I watched a streamer play it with friends in front of 13k thousand viewers yesterday and he had a blast, meanwhile not even knowing that you can't shoot while you are getting defended by someone. He still had fun, I saw the excitement in his eyes meanwhile he was watching whether  the ball will go into the basket or not.  ALSO, IT'S SUPER FUN TO PLAY WITH FRIENDSEven if you dislike basketball, dislike sports games like I do, you might still have a blast. It might still be super fun for you, or at least fun for 3-10 hours. You have nothing to lose, it's  free to play. Grab some friends, put your game pants and gunnars and go play it! This game is awesome and the devs definitely stepped up their game, adding new elements and improving  the old ones. "

												I started playing this because its free and I actually enjoyed it. I had like 100+ hours on it creating new accounts to earn 150k points. Bought 500 Gkash for the event.I was able to feel satisfied with how my character looks and plays. But as soon as I reach level 24. No one would play with you. If there is, they will call you NOOB throughout the whole game. Then use a microphone and harass you throughout. Community sucks! People are jerks~! There are some who would play with you but for the most part everyone is a jerk. Downfall of this game is how jerks high level people or seasoned people are and it really sets me back.Goodluck to this game. Its fun till 24 and if you like getting called noob and doesnt bother getting owned by seasoned players or getting kicked from room to room spending 15 minutes just to play 1 game then get called a noob then kicked then this game is for you.

												+ Nice game mechanics..blocking,rebounding,shooting etc feels real and timing based..+ Graphic style is decently good..+ Various challenges and daily quests- Heavy money involved..like around 50% of the game content needs you to pay real money..i haven't been too deep into the game but seen the cool chars costs like $20 per character..- Level grind is quite slow- Servers still quite troublematic..sometimes you have auto win or auto lose because someone instantly DC'edupdate:- stopped playing the game since it's DCing all the time (im using the asian server)- played against a paid character and she had like 10 consecutive 3pt's (30 points)..its quite ridiculous even in real life basketball..

												The first negative aspect is the toxicity of the game. Theyre naive enough to insult and berate a teammate for a mistake when they also make mistakes. Through levels 1-23 I genuinely enjoyed the game. But when I hit 24 and was forced to go to the next server I was annihilated. The players were 2x my speed. My sprint was slower than their jog. The way the advancement in this game is setup favors veterans whom haave already achieved level 50 and give the new players near no hope. Was fun until level 24 so if you're looking to kill some time playing this game for a week or so is a good option			"

												I've been playing Freestyle for 7 long years. Since I was 12 years old, Freestyle has been my favorite game.It has been with me throughout all my teenage years, and I don't regret a thing.Ever since it first came out in 2006 (published by Activision), the game has had issues maintaining a good population due to lack of advertising and support from the foreign developers (JCE).That's all hopefully going to change now that it has been released on Steam. It's a shame how we had to wait so many years for this because this is one of the most competitive games in the world.Everybody who plays this game strives to ultimately be the best, and it's a team game so you have to find 2 other players who share the same mindset as you and want to be the best just as bad as you are.A lot of this game consists of managing egos of not only your rivals, but your teammates also.There is only one ball in the game of basketball, and scoring is only one part of it.You have to have a good overall team that can not only score, but rebound, defend, block, steal, and pass at the right times.This game is all about customization and making your player unique. There is a big item shop in the game that allows you to buy headgear,tops,bottoms, shoes, and accesories to make your baller look unique.There are also Freestyles that allow you to change basic animations like dunks and shots so you can turn your simple one handed dunk in to a crazy 360 between the legs dunk!Then you have your skills. Skills are new animations and upgrades you unlock through leveling your character.Skills are the most important part of the game since they give really useful animations like diving for the ball or fading away.When you first start the game and you go in to Rookies, you will be playing versus new players such as yourself who are also learning the game and it will be a cake walk for those who learn faster than others.Beware though, there is a huge learning curve when you reach the big leagues (PRO Channel).People do NOT like losing in Pros because it will result in their win % going down and the person that beat you having proof of them beating you.I was never a guy to make many friends on this game, in fact I made a lot more enemies than I did friends and I am very hated but my advice to you new players is, make some friends before you reach Pros.Try your hardest to communicate and socialize, post on the forums. MAKE FRIENDS. You do not want to be that ""random"" ""unknown"" person in Pros because nobody knows you and you will be kicked out of teams that have good players when you try to join because they simply don't know you.You will be stuck on the ""Noob Treadmill"". That means you will be stuck playing only with players who are really bad and don't care who they play with, and other unknown players like you are which means you will lose A LOT and people will never see you as good.So make friends before you get to pros! Get your name out there.If you pick up this game and decide you like it and you're either a PG,PF,or C then you can add my character in game, I will help you. My IGN is: ZarrySo yeah, that is it for my long review and although my time on this game is coming to an end, I am happy it is finally getting the exposure it deserves because I know theres a kid out there right now maybe even reading this whos 12 or 13 years old that will fall in love with this game and aspire to be the very best player just like I did.Good look in the pros, newbs.

												Having played this game for quite some time this is how I feel about it:Positive:+ It's fun: Seriously, the game is really fun.+ Has a nice mixture of simplicity and complexity: The game is easy to get into, the controllers are kind of basic but it has a high skill cap, it's hard to master them.+ Character Costumization: It's really nice.+ The game has tons of features to keep you entertained: Bingo, My Ball, Freestyles, Challenges, etc.+ It's rewarding to play: The achievement system combined with Bingo, My Ball, Freestyles, etc. makes you feel like a winner even when you're losing, so there's some reward in actually playing the game, even if you're not that good at it and just like playing it for the sake of having fun.+ MVP: MVP rewards the player that contributes more for the team instead of the one that just scores all the time. Maybe it could be a bit more balanced, but it's nice to see the game reward team play.Ofcourse there are negative points too.Negative:- Paying actually makes you better: Or atleast makes you seem like you are. Paid characters, like Ginger, for example, WILL punish you if you make a mistake, they are deadly because of the bonus they are given. Maybe in higher levels of gameplay that becomes less noticeable, but in lower levels it's really noticeable, they barely miss. And also there are skill slots unlockable by paying, and that gives more options to people that pay to unlock them, giving them an advantage over free plays. I'll put this on capslock: THE GAME IS NOT FULLY PAY TO WIN. That's not what I'm saying here! What I'm saying is the feeling that I got, that if you're a free player and paying against a paid character in a similar player skill level it's more likeable that he will easily punish your mistakes thanks to the character he has than you are likely to punish is, since you don't have as much stats and special bonus as he has.- Matchmaking is... weird: I dont know how matchmaking works on this game, but more than a few times I got to play against players that you could see by the skills they were using that they were atleast 10 levels above the players on my team. And I also felt the reverse on some games, that I was being matched with people levels below. Most of the time it felt fine, but I think it was like 80/20, so I thought it would be worth to mention.- Menus: Menus can be a bit confusing for newer players, since they are presented with a huge BOOM of stuff.- Clarity: The game isn't very clear on some stuff. For example, I had to go google for quite a bit of time why I couldn't level any stat after putting 5 points into it and the game doesn't tell you what keys to use on your controller, so even if it supports it, it's kind of better to play on the keyboard. That kind of stuff.Overall it's a good and fun game. I recommend it, even if you don't like basketball that much, give it a shot and try to bring your friends to play it with you, only makes it more fun. I'm curious to see the game evolve, since It's kind of new, from what I've read.			"

												This is the same FreeStyle Street Basketball MMO under new management with a re-touched coat of paint and 5-10 extra ways to get you to spend money on items you don't actually want.Pros:-Fresh, vibrant artstyle-Arcade style gameplay-Decent Customization options-Well-organized lobbies ranked by skill level-Bot support-Clan supportCons:-Annoying community-Sketchy connection issues (On my first FSBB2 session, I was dropped from a game loading screen no less than 7 times in a row)-Puzzling sound direction (I don't necessarily mind the Korean rap, but the voice acting leaves a bit to be desired)-Too many unnecessary features. Booster cards, gachapon-style power-ups, robots that shout nice things and return balls for you after each shot in practice, a post-game breakdown that pats you on the back and lets you pick a mystery card: basically, every smoke-and-mirrors parlor trick mobile game designers have tried to implement into one gaudy, bedazzled cardboard box.In short: yes, I found it fun. I found it fun the last time I played the same game 5 years ago. There isn't enough improvement here for me to specifically recommend the game to any of my friends, especially not the ones who abandoned the game with me last time. I was expecting something different out of a sequel to a game that already had glaring flaws regarding netcode and connection issues, honestly. Daily Login bonuses and fake tickets for electronic roulette prizes won't cover up the few issues that still seem to exist.			"

												Real basketball fans and players wouldn't be impressed with this game's mechanics or animations because this game doesn't  go for a realistic basketball simulation. Instead this game focuses on team play and player customisation and most of customisable things are aquired by playing the game, not by spending real money. Post game rewards and leveling up keeps you playing and grinding through the game. Just remember that if you want the best experience , team up with 2 of your buddies and it will be a lot more fun and enjoyable to play :) Overall: If your looking for a realistic basketball simulation - don't bother, It's not NBA 2K, but if your looking for a fun, grindy,arcady team game - try it out.

												Pros:- easy to get into with a bit of basketball knowledge- first hours are really fun- if you get good teamplayers and go on a winning streak, it is really fun but..Cons:- ..but that nearly never happens, toxic community, lot of ego players, who only spam ""pass me the ball"" and never pass back and insult you anyway- the game supports this ego style because being open isnt as important as individual skill and outplaying your direct opponent- simple but sometimes weird acting controls (buttons have 2-3 different functions, dunk and postgame for example), different results in same spots and blocks and rebounds seem a lot like coin flips most of time, or i didn't play long enough to understand the mechanics.- lags are a huge issue, a lot of players warp around the court and score or rebound or get lose balls without the game even showing anything. it just happens.- terrible UI, lots of bugs, long loading times, the game hides a lot of information for example skills and stats of other players, which i guess is intended because..- .. massive P2W, you can buy toys, cards, skills, freestyles and clothing with bonus stats- no real matchmaking, you could get a team of 3 Cs who just afk or a perfect P2W team with a 5 game winning streak, both games are going to be no fun at all.Summary:It really has a lot of potential and could be fun, but the issues and the community are just to bad to keep playing it for longer.

												This is from the perspective of a new player - i've played a couple hours or so of FSBB2 and here's my honest review. PROS: It's essentially 3-on-3 basketball. If you love basketball as a sport and as a game, this right here is it!  Simple at the start, gets more complex as you gain levels and ""skills"". This includes player skill as well as actual skills that you buy for your character ingame.  Additionally, customization is great. Loads of costumes, the ability to pick your skills to do stunts with, as well as ""freestyle"" skills, which you can think of as EX moves which use meter in fighting games;  do enough in a match and they become available for you to use. Cards are also a part of customization, you can load up cards that help you with certain statistics. On level up, you get to distribute points to certain characteristics as well, further making your character truly unique. Positions function as classes in this game. There're primarily offensive positions and defensive positions, as well as assist positions. All of them are viable, though some are more preferred than others. This gives some distinction between characters but as mentioned in the previous point, you can make your character have strengths that are adverse to contemporary assumptions. (A 3-pt shooting center? Why not?) Personal preference, but I like the aesthetic and music. It's fitting with the style of FSBB2.CONS:Oh dear, here we go. Perhaps the most destructive aspect of the game is the community. Predominantly filled with Filipino, Thai, and Indonesian players, English fails to become the primary language in this game. The community is very exclusive in nature, and unless you're part of their culture, you'll be isolated and alienated. Furthermore, many players are extremely toxic in nature, playing the game only to win. They'll personally admonish weaker players as soon as they make a mistake, and they take absurd pride in their own abilities even though they make mistakes as well. You wanna destroy a multiplayer game? This exclusive, toxic-filled community is how your game dies.  Pay-to-win. If you're a F2P player, be prepared to lose. A lot. Unless your team has veteran players or Pay2Win players, there's absolutely a slim margin chance of you ever beating your opponent, especially if they're Pay2Play. The greatest example I can give is that basic stats become skyrocketed the moment you have buffed equipment on. These equipment buffs are equivalent to around 30ish player levels at least, and that's not including the card and pet system as well. Between players of equal skill, the one with P2P equipment will always, ALWAYS win. That's just the nature of the beast. You'll be outrebounded, out blocked, out scored (your blocks will become ineffective).  Lack of a ""skill-less"" channel. You know, the above point can be completely circumvented by the addition of one simple thing - channels that remove all additional buff stats (but lets everyone keep a set number of skills). With this, everyone can play on an equal level. People will be forced to play with others outside their circle and the community will be more accepting. The only drawback with this server is that GameKiss will fail to make any form of profit from it. Who doesn't want to be overpowered? This is a stretch - but recent games like Overwatch have added special ""swear filters"" that replace the swear words with text to bemean the aggressor. A lack of such a system here (seriously, does anyone even use the report function) allows players to be as toxic and as horrible as they want without any repercussions. To be honest, I cannot see myself even reaching level 50 in this game with the current drawbacks. As I level more, the players become more unforgiving and loathing. It's embarassing to even be associated with them and their culture - I routinely kick toxic players from my team even though they may be performing well and giving me wins.I do love this game, and I can spend HOURS practicing my skillsets on my own - it's just that as a multiplayer game, the community is absolute garbage and leaves me wanting nothing more. Food for thought: why is it that SEA communities are always incredibly idiotic and taxing to play with? Most of them are asshats and ruin the multiplayer experience for everybody. "

												Too easy. Not Addictive.  Trash community. Trash gamekiss. Trash game 6/9 would not recommend.Edit: Ok, honest review : Unless you plan on dropping a few hundred bucks on a game that doesnt even have more than a hundred players on at once, or are extremely skilled/asian/no life at games, dont pick up this game. IT will suck away your already non-existant life and make you miserable. This game is not for the weak. The skill difference between top players and beginners is like a pro player in League vs a Bronze player. With the ASTOUNDING 50 active playerbase, you will eventually get put up against players that will destroy you sooner than you know(probably 1 week into the game).  Those that cannot survive a TOXIC COMMUNITY WHERE EVERYONE THINKS THEY ARE THE BEST and insanely unbalanced games due to THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS BY MOST PEOPLE SO THEY CAN BE OVERPOWERED should just leave. Backed with the fact that the company running this game wants to take your money, you will be pounded in AND out of game. Sure, the gameplay itself is fun and addictive. But still IT ISN'T WORTH IT. As a player who has achieved the PINNACLE OF FS2(becoming a major tournament champion), I would trade back these 2000 HOURS WASTED for a pack of condoms. Don't do this to yourself. Stay in school kids.2nd Edit : Forgot to mention 30% of the community hacks and gamekiss does nothing to ban/update the 2 year old hackshield. TL;DR -  FK YOU READ MY REVIEW IM A GOD.			"

												Been playing this game since release, and played way back since Freestyle 1 when Sierra own the game, still overall fun and enjoyable, don't really care much if it's pay to win, It's fun, the graphics doesn't really matter since it's cell shaded, and overall there are tons of skills to use. When it comes to BallingIsLife™ this game still deserves the award of being fun and even if you don't like sport games, this is still an enjoyable game due to the mechanics of it and animation which I find humorous. Game was my childhood and I'm still playing it.Pros: Easy to learnFun to playLots of clothes and customizationsLots of skillsToy system is interesting to play around for statsStill feels like the old free style gamesDunking on people feels amazing!TournamentsGrowing communityCons:Pay to win *Debatable*Lots of foreign people play so teamwork is hard to communicateServers are a little unbalance from level capsLots of people sliding due to the lag of the serverReasons why I say pay to win is debatable is because I have accounts that have never touched a single cent from my wallet, and overall I am still able to win games, on my main accounts I have 85% win rates on them and played over thousands of games with them, My personal opinion it really depends on your skill level and how you play the game, because when you're playing the game, you'll see that anyone can shoot and make baskets, or defend and block shots, its really how well you play with your team and how good your offense and defense is. Overall good game, I enjoy it and Its free, so play the game.			"

												I've been playing since FSB 1 back in the Sierra days... and in my honest opinion... this game is fun but the community is one of the worst I have ever seen...The game is very fun and entertaining once you get the basics down but until then it's very frustrating playing in the rookie server with people who are selfish and doesn't know the meaning of teamwork... Some people don't realize that this game actually has a pretty steep learning curve... it's not all just shoot shoot shoot...FSB 2, similar to the 1st game, has elements of P2W but I think you can hold your own, without spending money, if you are a good enough player. If you enjoy the game, I recommend learning the basics of team-play if you want to advance any further: passing, rotating, defense, etc... like i said, it's not all just shoot shoot shoot steal steal steal...About the community... this game is sadly filled with a lot of kids who talks a lot of trash and have big egos... It's like high school all over again... everyone has their own ""cliques"" that they play with and will kick anyone else out (sadly, sometimes I don't blame this type of behavior because a lot of players don't bother to learn the game correctly so they become a liability to the team, therefore leading to no one wanting to play with them). I don't suggest you visit the forums of this game, especially on the gamekiss website, it's so toxic... Overall, I like the FSB series... but the horrible community and lack of competent players/teammates can make it frustrating for newcomers... If you have friends who are willing to go through the ups/downs of the game with you, I think FSB can be very enjoyable experience...			"

												At first,when i saw the game i was like,OHMIGOD THIS LOOKS SO AWESOME I CAN'T WAIT TO DOWNLOAD THIS RIGHT NOW!Oh how wrong i was...Ok so let's start with this. This is not NBA basketball,this is street Basketball,which basically means 3v3 on one court 5 minute basketball matches,no fouls,no overtimes,no free throws. The gameplay is really fun,addictive and easy to understand,but hard to master. There are 5 classes for you to choose,plus 3 more if you want an advanced class of sorts. The game has MMORPG elements such as skills(fade away,double clutch etc)and things like tricks that can be used for doing 3pts or dunks or blocks (Twister,The Shot,etc). Plus you have a level up system,which awards with attribute points so you have better chances of doing 3pts dunks or blocks.But once you realize the faults of this game,you are better off uninstalling it.First off,the game is Pay-to-Win-ish,a F2p game for me should have at least micro-transactions for cosmetics and stuff like that,not for special characters like point guard son goku over there.Second,the game has a lot of bugs,connection issues,freezes,which need to be fix ASAP.Third,the community i say is more like CS:GO's and LOL's community long lost son who was adopted by an Asian. It's filled with ungrateful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s,12 year old's who say that they are ♥♥♥♥ing your mom,and just toxicity all around. And it dosen't help that once you leave rookie and have an unbalance between veteran players and rookies (basically think of it as a Team of LVL 12 novices vs LVL 50 veterans)Fourth. BITCOIN MINERFifth. HACKERS. I have at least spotted 3 hackers in 3 games. If this doesn't get fixed,it will be S4 League all over again.In conclusion,without the Hackers,the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community,the bugs,the Bitcoin Miner,and the skill gap when you leave rookie servers. This game would be better than an NBA game for at least 5 years due to it's potential.It's just the potential,is stuck under the river of cons i said. "

After exiting the rookie channel, Every game you play, you will face either P2W players or hackers. Maybe at peak hour you can find some normal players. I don't know p2w, but the hacks are getting out of hands and it really destoryes the gaming experience and the game company is not doing anything to punish the hackers. This game is going down hill, with very few player base. Even at peak hour you owuld see about 30 games.			"

												Great game. 10/10Players 3/10The people in it? Almost like a bunch of immature brats trying their best flaming each other, looks silly, quite entertaining may I add. Pretty rare to not see: -people arguing on megaphones-people arguing in-game match (if you argued as much as you did played... -Oh, let me just stop myself)-people spamming chat-people putting down other people-arrogant players (met quite a lot of these players)-the one that talks a lot (talking [insert poop emoji])-people kicking you from the match/court whatever-toxic and salt (aka ill-mannered according to FS2)-pay-to-win/obvious pay-to-win with skills (which is not a bad thing, you invest in what you want)Where the GM's at..?I'd recommend this game, but I wouldn't at the same time. The community (not all) is toxic. There's just one event I will never forget, which scarred my life. I would be glad if the GM's removed the chat completely while in-game, or at least the ""All,"" chat because people somehow can't help it and cry or the need to trash talk.			"

BUT I tried installing it on my own computer recently cause I was playing it on a different account and it was pretty sketchy, I then turned to the steam reviews to see if anyone else had this problem and I found out that it contains Bitcoin Miners. I'm not 100% percent sure what BitCoin Miners are but I have a feeling they're not too good lol. Other then that the game isn't that bad for a free to play game but if you wanna stay on the safe side then don't bother with this game.			"

												Quick review for those who want to try this game.Pros:+ Decent gameplay.+ Character customization.+ Nice BGM and in-match commentary.Cons:- Bitcoin miner inside gamefiles (fixed ?).- Unrealistic physics.- Pay2win: * Special Character have 40 more attribute points than normal characters. You can either get Buzzer Beater (which have no additional passive) from reaching lvl-50, purchase from the cash shop or pray to rngesus to get it from balls (similar to gacha).* Cosmestic's stats boost which cost real money to add it permanently.* Stats boost card gacha.* Skill slots which cost real money (can get from event which occur once a year[?] )Conclusion: It's a nice game to play if you have a lot of money to spend.

												It's fun for a bit and the game runs pretty well. I only experience small amounts of latency issues that really changed the tide of the match but it was rare. My true gripe with the game is the balancing as you level up, not so much the balance once you're at the top of level and have unlocked all the skills and attributes. During the first few levels on the beginner server, the game is fun but it's ruined by ball hogs and people who don't understand the sport or the game at all. I think out of 50+ Matches I had in the beginner server, very very few of the matches were competitive. Either your team stomped the other team or your team got stomped because you were paired up with people who didnt understand the fundamentals to the game (would try to do half court shots with a C, SG's would just stay under the rim for a rebound) But the games that were closer in score were actually really fun. Once you're fresh out of the beginner server, thats when the game gets even worse, you still have people who don't understand the game at all but not only that, you are matched up against people who have unlocked very strong skills that you don't have access to until you grind out several dozen matches. These skills literally make the player exponentionally overpowered compared to the skills you have when you are a fresh level 12 (Alley-Oop spam, Back Step dribble, etc.) So you have to endure through these matches because more often then not, you will be paired up with people still learning the game and have no idea how to play against teams that are already overpowered so they resort to afk exp farming. That alone is abused like heck, people just matches just to afk and get the match experience because they know they will most likely lose to higher level players. I'd love to recommend the game because it can be really fun, but it just gets worse until you get to much higher level and everyone balances out and the game becomes more skill based. But enduring the grind of the early levels coupled with players that don't understand the game and the afk farm, just ruins it all for me.			"

												UPDATE!!!!!!!!!! --- It seems someone else noticed what i wrote below. They implemented 2 new channels, of which one is for real rookies without lvl 12 char in account only. This seems very wise and good decision. Unfortunately i allready have a char above 12.....(which is ridicoulisly fast achieveable.)OLD VERSIONS CRITIC:Game mechanics and stuff others may explain. Basically theres 3 ""tiers"" ""leagues"" for competive mode, which is the main event of this game, allthough you can play with and vs AI. I recommend AI-Game-Mode but the competive mode, the main dish so to say, sucks. I will explain. 1. This game is PAY 2 WIN, At first you might not see it directly but in later game you notice it is. The 3 Tiers are Rookie, Major and Pro. Rookie League: Either real noobs like you and me, with different outcome and so on. +Pro's with their new characters. In Rookie League some of them say stuff like ""OMG OMG WORST SF EVER"" ""LEARN TO PLAY!"" and many many harsh things. They dont bother to explain what exactly you did wrong and so on.  Even if you are C and they are SG and you dont manage to rebound EVERY ball, just maybe 50-60% it can happen easily that they start to flame. In Rookie League. Without asking your level or experience. Without explaining, without giving help.  If you manage to hit lvl 12 quick, which is easy done, the heat is on. Major League. If you mess up here, be prepared to see many censored lines^^ Next thing: Even on EU Server, you see many many Russians. And they as unfriendly as a drunk russian could be.If you dont want to sink lots of cash into the game, dont have many friends you can form a crew with and learn together with and as good as allways play together or have a thick fur or dont plan to play further than Rookie or Major League, stay away from this game. Call a friend. Play ball in RL. You might not dunk, but you might be able to end the next guy who flames you without reason or explanation.  Had fun for  a week of exstensive playtime, but that community is the worst i ever encountered.			"

												I used to play this game years ago. It was fun. It still is, aside from the obnoxious music. And the fact that I've only been able to actually get connected to the server ONCE. Frequently hangs while trying to connect to the server. Until the servers are fixed, I wouldn't bother with it. Has potential to be a good game like it used to, the music ruins it, and the horrible servers need a lot of work. I'd wait a bit longer before playing this.			"

												IGN:  Valioa ( Level 50 PG Clara Balanced Type, Known for magical diving catches)( ' w ' ) / Ladies and Gentleman. \ ( ' w ' )  This is a game in which you start out as a trainee, learning the ropes of the game, most likely losing a lot (well, it depends if you are playing with total strangers), and as you ""go on"", you just get better and better, eventually winning.Like I said above, don't expect to be good at the start, and PLAY with friends!  This game is  heavily team-based, featuring 3v3 basketball matches that can get hectic pretty fast in the long run, especially in the pro channels.When I started out in the game, I didn't like how bad I was, and how bad my teammates were sometimes. But its ok. I came out on top, became one of the best at my position (Point Guard), and I believe I am well known in the FS2 community xD.  ITS ALL ABOUT PERSERVERANCE...!NEVER GIVE UP!  Create the best freestyle 2 team out there with your friends young padawan.  Heck, maybe even join a crew (The ""Bruh"" Crew, lead by Left-Eye is a really good start, a crew that allows anyone willing to learn the game a chance at getting better overall)AND REMEMBER....  In Pie We Trust.™ ( ' w ' ) //			"

												Ok, first, it's really fun. But not when you created a new level 1 character and being called noob. Nevertheless, you'll level up eventually, so it's not really a problem to me. For the gameplay, it's smooth and good-looking. The graphic is weird but it does give you a fresh feeling, like, you know, first time playing a game that is made in Korea. Despite the community is a little bit bad, but, just stay strong and ignore them, like you're deaf or something. It's not a big deal, but the big deal is dealing with yourself. It's F**KING HARD to ignore them, and I've played this game for 700+ hours, you know how much pain I've gone through. But it's really fun, trust me. If you're a fan of basketball, or you love to play basketball but never had the chance to play it, it's a good game. And it becomes addictive when you play it for a several hours. So, for those who want to play it(after reading my review), please do play it with your friends, because everyone there is your rival. Only some of them are friendly(just like me), so I'll see you on the court. My name is qpJackqp in-game. Now here is the rating:Audio:7/10Graphic:7/10Gameplay:9/10(because some player afk)*I assume you guys know what is ""afk""Community:6/10Overall:8/10*Also, I spent RM120 on this game, LOL			"

												Good game mechanics, clever concept, fantastic tutorial !!Would I recommend it? Absolutely NOT !!It is simply a PAY-To-WIN  game. Let me elaborate rather briefly.1) You can purchase skill slots to constantly have an upper hand, therefore no matter how uber l33t your opponents are, you have more options.2) You can purchase special game characters that have higher stats by default, so a special PF will always beat common Center under the rim. You will cap your rebound, they will still out-jump you etc.3) You can purchase cards that will make your character un-blockable.BONUS: The majority of players are from Turkey / Russia, two countries located mainly Asia whose players absolutely love playing in the EU server, despite there are 2 asian servers. This means ridiculous lag to players based in the EU.You will happily play the game at first and in the first 20-30 levels you will just give this the benefit of the doubt; then by the time you have learned the game you realise it's futile. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME !!			"

												I like this game, I really do.. Its one of hte funner basketball games out there (outside of NBA 2k), The controls are relatively simple,  and it can be real competitive. The only REAL problem is all the hazers and people giving newbies hell for not be an instant legend. Its unreal how some people int his game just jump down someones throat if you miss one shot.. Overall, If you have tough skin, and dont let words and critisism bother you, I think its a game worth playing.			"

												This game all-in-all is a good game. It is free-to-play and not so pay-2-win. It still requires skills and good internet.The soundtracks are so catchy and the genre matches the game be can be repetitive and dull.The gameplay is very simple. Gamers who have experience in NBA 2K series would find this extremely easy to play.As for the characters, they are very cute and fierce. (I like Grace of Noble lol)The downside is, it is very slow to load at the start of the game and at the start and end of every game. It lags occasionally.Another downside is not everybody is speaking English, people usually prefer speaking their own language but I don't think that there's a language barrier, though. They prefer Filipino, Thai, Indonesian language and etc. (I am talking about the Asian server here) Sometimes it is an issue for them if you are from different country and their own native bad words are all around the shout-out area. Not a big deal, though, because the community is somewhat friendly too.As for customization, there are a vast number of equipments that you can use but you cannot remove the default equipment of your character for some reason. like for instance, the armband defaults.Another thing I don't like is the special characters are so expensive but I think it's okay because they are called special for a reason.I want Girls Generation (SNSD) characters to be released in the Steam version of the game too.

												This game is fun until you play with hackers. Really fun to get out some Basketball in your system. With the hackers its ever y 2-3 games you have to deal with one to an extent where they can teleport the ball from your current possion to the middle of the FT line. And every other team name has Racial slurs in it or some sexual enundos. I'm not fantastic at this game but when I'm not playing with a hacker its great even though it is semi Pay to win but it also milks the aspect of skill.I'm gonna say I don't recommend this game for now since they fail to deal with the Hacking basically says its ok to hack away to win. Better off playing NBA2k14 or 2k15. As a gamer its hard for me to talk bad about any games and it pains me to see a game thats fun to be overran by hackers.			"

												This game in short is a great experience by yourself until a point.  In the game they're 2 types of ""ranking"" leagues Major and Pro.  Major is 1-24 and Pro is 24-50.  Major is more friendly and kind this is also where playing solo is fine.  But... Pro is just about impossible to play solo you NEED people to que who won't say your bad when you make one mistake and in a sense throw the game.  So in total Major is really fun, Pro, playing solo is a bad decision you pry have a better chance of throwing yourself off a cliff and hoping you don't hit your skull and have your brains splatter everywhere.

												You can do a variety of things, from abnormal tricks that seem impossible if applied to logic and reality, to simple but yet outstanding team work. This game is pretty good, I have played for 9hrs and i can already tell that this is a beautiful game. 7/10There is a lot in this game despite the simple looking graphics. You can buy a ton of clothes, skills, gear ect. You can even buy pets that add to your stats. However  you need to pay to win (all the end gear) and if you're a free player then it will be hard to beat a person that has their character smothered with pay to win gear.The thing is the game is all about luck/probabilty and that's where the true skills show, you have to be able to make great postioning, thinking out the box, so on.... Pros-Very easy to pick up and learnMultiplayerCustomisable characters Applicable skills that relate to basketball. (alley oop, ect..)Cons-Pay to win ( you can buy much more with real $$$)Ball greeds (worse than football)Sometimes you get matched with that 'special snowflake'			"

												Well, the game is good and I like it. I agree, community isn't the best, BUT there're people who are good and friendly!Also, a lot of people are saying that the game is pay 2 win, it is at some point, but at the same time it isn't.Pros:1. There are A LOT of events (after one event ends, next event starts)2. Game is easy and fun to play3. On different events you can get free spc (special character), you also get free spc after hitting lvl 50 on your first character4. You can add temporary stats to your items for ingame currencyCons:1. you are at some point weak if you don't have special character (they have 40 bonus stat points which is huge boost)2. you have to invest real money to get permanent stats on itemsIn other words, if you want to be powerful in this game, all you have to do is just spend some time in this game. You don't have to invest real money to be the best.			"

												A comprehensive review of Freestyle 2: Street Basketball that covers problems that newcomers will not notice until 100+ hours worth of gameplay later.1. For new comers, this game is very fun, very appealing, very unique and very attractive. A free to play basketball game with cool skills and smooth animations. This game is very fun if you and your friends are bored and just want to mess around and try a new game. THis game will make you laugh and you will have a great time until you get hooked...2. After a few days of playing you start to get frustrated because you begin to lose even though you try and your random teammates begin to yell and are toxic at you. 3. The community in this game is very very small, as you can see if you search up Freestyle 2: street basketball steam charts. Averaging around 1000 players, and this is spread amongst a few servers: N.A, Europe and Asia. 4. This small community means you will play against the same players very very frequently. Additioanlly, many veteran players will create new characters so you are always versing the same players, just different characters. 5. The game is slightly pay to win. You can easily drop $100 on this game if you play it often. Players may spend money on clothes that give stats like rebound, 3 point etc. Or they may spend money on a gamble to obtain legendary card sets which provide large stat bonuses.6. There is a really really big underlying problem that is hidden to new players and that is the server imbalance. THe N.A servers are on the west. Any players living on the west (California) get ~30ms ping. If you live central you get ~60ms. If you live east(New York) you get ~90ms. IF you live in south america you get ~100+ms(A.k.a you're screwed and don't play unless you like playing in the past compared to everyone else). Having a low ping offers really really big advantages in this game. If you are a PG and you have 10ms, you can outreb a center who has 90ms. 7. Gamekiss is money hungry and always creates new events to make them profit, but never fixes bugs within the game. Events like ""SPend 50$ and get additional items"". Additioanlly, gamekiss frequently reuses events that have been created before but just with a different theme. Some examples include bingo, dice roll. And theses events encourage you to pay for extra dice rolls or extra bingo rolls. Some bugs that have been in the game for a long time that is never fixed is the F9 key. The f9 key resets the ball in a waiting room because sometimes the ball bugs and cannot be picked up. The fact that there needs to be an f9 key suggest that gamekiss does not really care about the game and the player experience. The ball should never bug out and need to be reseted. Additioanlly, there are many desyncs in skills. Players see different things happening on their screen compared to other players which causes lag blocks, lag steals, sliding.  And these desyncs have nothing to do with internet but rather the skill being used itself because the desync happens everytime someone uses the skill. (unless the coincidence is so great that each time the player uses the specific skill, backwards two step, their internet lags). 8. The match making is extremely unfair, and this can be due to the fact that there's a small community so you always verse the same players. You can be a lvl 24 with lvl 24 teammates versing a full lvl 50 team.			"

												Super fun in the lower ranks when you and everybody else are newcomers testing the waters of this interesting Free to Play sports title. Upon advancing into the higher leagues, though, it becomes clear that if you have any hope of remaining competitive you have no choice but to purchase upgrades for your character. Free alternatives for character building are available, but progression requires so much game time that there's no way to keep pace with players that have money laying around to buy clothing upgrades and abilities.

( Or something like that ) Now the begginers that want to play get to play against players that are level 16 and get insulted , bullied , called on.- You don't get alot of points so u can buy new skills on other characters or other , but you can use a coupon that gives u some extra % on Points and Exp i think you should upgrade from around 120 - 260 IF you win Bonus if u loose well ur choice.

												The first freestyle street basketball failed because there was too much lag, too many bugs, too many toxic players.  This one will fail in time as well for the same reasons.  If you want to cheat in this game, all you have to do is download large files while you play to create a lag issue.  The opposing team won't be able to block your shots, or steal from you, or even escape you if you are trying to guard from their shots.  I have tried that tactic and it works every time.  Being an international game with no servers for each region of the world, lag is a very major issue.By the way, unless you buy one of the premium characters, you will go nowhere.  It is definitely pay to win.			"

Lag on gameplay..i don't know why Asia server unstable, Initially server is not bad, but now is very bad.just because they bought to win in this game so many players are selfish, arrogant, hate each other.""10/10 if you want to show off greatness of arrogant, this is the best place""			"

This has been my experience for most of the games I've played on here so far.

												This game is fun as hell and super good but let me explain why i rated as ""Not Recommended""The players, that is the biggest thing in a game like this , a game that forces co-op , the player base is full of russians or asians that do not understand english and makes it pretty much impossible to comunicate , it is also full of a bunch of 12 years old that as soon as  they pick the ball they want to do everything alone , and they wont pass you.So , want a game super fun but no one will understand you or pass you? There you have it! (Remember the game itself is good but the players suck)			"

												Its a good game, however its a f*cking P2W. It always has been ever since it was created with Sierra, I been playing FS for a very long time. However, I will not be putting this as a negative review since I still play this game and will always play it. I just love FS. Don't my cons scare you, however take it in consideration since it's true. If you don't believe me play FS 2 for about 25 hours and then tell me what you see.Now here is the pro and cons:Pros:- Fun game when you have respectful playersCons:- P2W: Pay to Win, which is very true. For example: When you buy a special character, you get a bonus stats when you create them. So if you were a PF, you would get a bonus like 5+ or something like that.- LAGGY, most of the players are from other countries playing on the US server. When you ask them why they don't play on theirs, they say something like ""Nobody is on the server, blah blah""- There are some good clothes in the game, however if you want to add attributes to them you can but they only last like 30 days or so. It wasn't like in FS, where some clothes you could pay to add attributs and it stays with you forever.- The freestyles are random and you never get to choose which ones you want like in FS. For example, if I wanted miller time for my SG, I would have to get Freestlye tickets and play the random sh*t hoping I could get it.- Most people don't know how to play at all, and also there is a lot of holders when it's the last 20 seconds.- The last thing, its a god damn PAY TO WIN. So, if you want to win a lot, you either do two things: First, pay money to get special characters, etc. Blah blah. Two: practice a lot and learn to PASS the ball, and use teamwork. I prefer the second option since in this game, it is easy to beat the special characters. And it's called TEAMWORK!!!			"

												Pros+Game can be fun when just messing aroundCons-P2W as ♥♥♥♥. You can do all this special stuff with skills, and apparently you can buy extra skill slots. So those who drop real money can do more stuff in game. Imagine a F2P MMORPG and then make it with baskeball, this is what you get. Oh, you want to do something like a hookshot or some other ""easy"" real life basketball shot? Yeah, that's a skill and you don't have it equipped!-Community sucks♥♥♥♥♥ They just ♥♥♥♥♥, moan, and act really rude. Nobody wants to help.-Worst tutorials i've ever seen. It teaches you how to move and shoot the ball. Seems easy, right? Well you get in game and lets say go for a dunk. All of a sudden you see a guy fly from across the court and knock you down mid air like he's ♥♥♥♥ing superman. I still don't know how people were screening. There's no god dam key bind page to see what the hell does what. -One of the worst UIs I've ever seen. It's clunky. It's confusing. It's horrible. 3/10. It's fun, but it's plagued by so many other issues, it quickly took the fun out of it. I was hoping to get an experience that reminded me of NBA street back in the day.

												The game is fun, don't get me wrong, but there is so much P2W aspects of the game it's unreal. It's great for a F2P game, but they could make money the right way and not allow people to P 2 W! There needs to be more modes; maybe a 5v5 full court action. Make the game more realistic and add some more physics and allow me to be able to block a dunk. There is also way too much to the game yet way too little, and what I mean by that, is there are stat cards and free styles and ""magic"" clothes that would give you the edge in a match. Just have normal basketball, that's all you need. Too little, basically what I said before, to where there aren't any game modes, and just there isn't much customization either, unless you wanna be a dragon helmeted nba player or a humongous black Jonas Brother. It's fun, but there's issues I'd hope and many others would hope they fix.			"

												I played the very first Freestyle Basketball and then i downloaded the asian version of Freestyle 2 back when it wasn't available for the United States, and I had played it very often when it was available. The one hour I have on steam was to see if this game was still pay to win, sadly it is. When you make a character you get to choose your position and you get to choose between a few sample characters with different heights, if you PAY the game though you can unlock other characters that have boosted stats and are much bigger than you. They will always be better than you no matter how much you play, this game is slightly skill based but it is very much like an arcade game. Rebounds can be grabbed from the other side of the goal just because a player has a higher attribute than you, regardless of your timing and positioning for it. Most shots fall in this game if you dont block them, which if you pay, you block everything. This game has the potential to be so much better, especially because it is the only basketball MMO out there, but they are stupid.			"

												Great F2P, even fun for people who don't play basketball. People say the game is Pay to win, because paid characters get better stats is NOT true. anyone who didn't pay can beat them, you can even win Paid characters from Daily log-in rewards (Not every log-in reward but I got a Noble from the log-in reward). The community is pretty toxic as well, But it is so fun to trash talk the other team when you beat them! Also very fun to play with friends, and sometimes random people but they can be rude at times. They could improve the loading time, the lag, and graphics. But other than that the game is one of the best F2P's I've ever played on here, and they always update the game!			"

The game instantly crashes when i get into an actual match, mathcmaking works fine, loading times and everything is fine; but when i get into the cinematic opening for the players the game crashes. It say please wait, then crashes. I was excited to play this game and this is actaully the 2nd time I have downlaoded it after I had the same problem the first time. I would really like some help as i want to play this game but am repeated let down and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at the fact that even almost after a year of leaving this game after it didnt work the first time im still getting the same old game breakering bug.

												Great  F2P  game for basketball lovers. Fun to play with friends. It's not  p2w (I repeat IT'S NOT P2W)  , it's  skill based  and the  timing  is important here. People are saying that it is p2w because of the special characters. Yeah they have 40 extra free stats to spend but they aren't impossible to beat and the events in the game are giving you multiple chances to earn those special characters (I have 2 and I didn't spend even 0.01$ on the game).Teamwork is essential in this game. Without teamword you will lose all the time!TL;DR:Pros:+fun to play with friends+you can win special characters for free+you can get almost everything for free+on every match there is a small chance for the game to be streamed accross the server and the spectators can vote for your team.+there is some sort of 1v1+the gameplay is smooth+there is a Club system with tournamentsCons:-there are some bugs-its rare to find a player who will listen to what you are saying to him-some people have laggy connections to the server			"

												This game sorta stinks. I can't find a grasp on how the shooting gauge works. The MC is God awfully annoying, since all he says is ""nice pass!"" ""oh you sneaky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!"". Community is filled with stuck up tight-wads with too much bullplop in their ears. Megaphones (an all out broadcast to the server) usually says something from xXx__BALLisLIFE__xXx ""heh rekt u #@$# pretty easily step up your game"". I find these rather disparaging comments annoying.The rookie channel is, as a commenter said before, filled with pros, as people could not merge their old accounts onto Steam. Articles of clothing are merely for looks, which really shows if someone has easy access to their parents' credit card number. Rookie channel, again, has some people failing a layup or easily shooting half-court threes with no trouble. The game lags a bit, sometimes characters and the ball spazzing out, or having characters that are nowhere near the ball all of a sudden having it.The community, as said, is a bunch of stuck up tight-wads. Some people ball hog and just keep dunking. Others can't read English, as when you need to go for 3's, they keep making layups. Like what the crud bro.The swearing filter has a really low bar. Words like ""crap"", ""crud"", ""wtf"", and even IDK has DK censored into i**, assuming dk is short for ""♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;. That really throws me off about this game.To summarize, a stuck up community, poorly optimized gameplay, really harsh swearing filter, spazzy characters and items. Also, don't forget really crappy random drops. Keep pulling blank cards. Continuing: megaphone abuse, and the somehow hated cell-shaded art. I really adore cell shading, so this game is looks nice. Then again, I haven't optimized it for my computer yet. Yet.Overall, game gets like a 2.5 out of 5 stars. Give it a whirl. If it's not your thing, then uninstall it. That's what I'll be doing.			"

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

You are always bound to get it unless one isnt generated. Good game to goof around. Tip F  is to dunk for all the new people wanting to be a dunker Greadt game.You should really try it out			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												April 1st Review(04/01/15):Freestyle 2 is a third-person shooter, action, MMORPG, team-based, real time strategy(RTS), sports, simulation, godly game. No one should ever talk♥♥♥♥♥♥about this glorious, godly game. This game deserves a 10/10 especially in the support, options, and spelling department(do they have a spelling department?). Please, rate 11/10 and play game all day everyday. Definitely no BS and no fail mechanics like good-ping-to-rebound, late blocking, bs blocks, or bs shots. NONE OF THIS IS IN THE GAME. DEFINITELY ALL BASKETBALL MECHANICS ARE LEGIT. THERE ARE DEFINITELY NO HACKERS IN THIS GAME...Legit Review(02/03/16):After playing this game for 10 months, it is safe to say that the company who runs this game is complete garbage. They do not care about the community at all, and would rather look for the game to turn into a gambling simulator than a fun basketball game. They do not care about hackers, and let them roam free. I would definitely be hesitant about picking this game up, but I will still recommend it because I still enjoy it very much. For other folks who are starting out... meh.Updated(12/25/16):The game has still not moved the server to central, which cuts out an entire side of the United States from playing a big man. They have been ""testing"" where to put the server, but it has been going on for months now.Tl;dr:Game is an arcadey-basketball game. A gambler's P2W game...			"

												Freestyle 2 was a great game. I had a splendid time playing this game with my friends the other day until... the 8th of April, 2015, 3:30 P.M. PST. Once I logged in to play this wonderful game, I retrieved my gifts and coupons. Afterwards, I went to buy some clothing to look swagggy. To test the clothing in-game, I went into a Co-op room. From there, I moved around and TRIED to shoot. From out of nowhere, I could not shoot. I kept pressing AND holding D, but all my character did were pump fakes (was playing as Shooting Guard). I was greatly upset. As an attempt to fix this problem, I played as another character. Unfortunately, I still couldn't shoot. My final attempt of fixing the problem was to reinstall the game. Once finished, I logged in and tried again. I had my hopes up, but Freestyle 2: Street Basketball disappointed me. I still could not shoot. Please, developers of this game, fix my problem and reignite my dreams. Thank you. (^~^)			"

												Played it for a week, had my fill. that's basically it. It's fun for a while but gets extremely repetitive and lacks any motivation to go on after you've customized your character the way you wanted. Of course, that's the case if you're not interested in rankings, tournaments and the like.    I haven't spent any money on it. ""Loot drops"" are frequent and, sometimes, they give you really nice items. However, I don't see how the game is ""completely p2w"" according to some people. You can only buy stat boosts with in-game currency and it's not hard to get if you play well enough and long enough.Customizing your character is really enjoyable and gives you a reason to play more just because you want to earn enough points to get that hat/shirt/hair.   My biggest problem with the game is the atrocious soundtrack. Of course, that's personal preference but in my opinion it was spine-chillingly unbearable. Awful Korean(?) hip-hop-pop tracks (guess it would be called k-hop, or k-rap, or whatever just so that its fans can distinguish themselves from others and feel ""so original and amazing"").   To end this - it's not a bad game, it's free and it can pretty much run on anything so there's no problem with anybody trying it. If you find it more entertaining than I did you can easily spend more than a week playing it. P.S. (Edit): I didn't expect to enjoy this game and was pleasantly surprised, so don't go into it with any prejudice.			"

												my biggest hate on the game is the shooting mechanic like it take nothing about defence into account and blk are completely random no timing is needed to block or rebound while in old freestyle u had to time ur blks time ur rebounds ur shot would get messed up if someone was near u. old freestyle game was great this new i must say is garbage and nothing more then a sink for people to waste their parents money			"

 WARNING! I DID NOT PLAY THE GAME THROUGH STEAM, BUT THROUGH THE CLIENT!  Sad. All the money I poured in. All the thoughts I had about future things I would be getting. Grinding and working hard. Took me a year to get to level 50, because I had work piled on top of school. Looking back, all I wish is that I hadn't. I wish I hadn't gotten hooked to this, I wish I hadn't wasted so much time on this, I wish I hadn't enjoyed playing games with my friends so that some miracle would prevent me from this disease.  PROS!  This game hooks you in once you get into it. The moment you see the flawless design, to the amazing slams and layups you could possibly pull of, you love it. I loved it; maybe I still do. Beautiful graphics,  not like CoD or BF1 or anything but y'know what I mean, haha.  great gameplay system, loads of fun with friends, customizability goes through the roof, etc. These statements make great points, but there are reasons why I don't recommend it.  CONS!  No mercy. Simply no mercy for new players. Thankfully, when I started there wasn't many players that would smurf in the first rookie channel, but soon after, it was extremely toxic. After you hit major-pro grounds, players will bash you for your playing, upon other things. If you look like a noob, you'll be treated like a noob. The worst part of games is a toxic community. To keep games running, you need a good community. Secondly, the game overall is P2W. There are things you can get that aren't pay to win, but to be the best of the best, you'll need to spend hundreds upon thousands of dollars on equipment. Clothes can get additional strengths to be added to them, which is unfair. Another thing that is unfair is that you can purchase physically advanced characters with ""better looks"" as well as stats, and another 60 points to spend on stats. There is unbearable lag, and the controls absolutely suck for beginners. They cannot keep players in their game what-so-ever. Some moves are absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and said that some shots make it in and there are certain things you can or can't do. The only time skill matters is when you hit level 50.  Saying that someone saying that it's a P2W game because they suck is illogical. I'm not a bad player, and I'm not good either, but I notice when something is wrong with a ♥♥♥♥ing game, and I know when to quit. Go ahead. Get addicted, let's see how you turn out, because it's not like I didn't spend all night on this game and I'm just a 1 time player, c'mon now. Shut the ♥♥♥♥ up, seriously, lol.   End Conclusion I don't recommend this game to anyone without money. Lots of money. To keep up, you will need to keep spending. Even the top players know that. They know they've spent hundreds of dollars on a F2P game,  and I'm sure that's something they regret.  and they know they've wasted their time on a trash, disfunctional game.			"

												Needs Eastcoast North American Servers. The ping disparities between players is the games biggest promblem (esspecially players who have or are willing to invest in the game).  The Game is mechanically pleasing, but the focus seems to be locked   on cosmetics and special characters  (which is fine to an extent), instead of investing in stability for an underserved portion of the community. The game is worth playing casually, but ping can potentially stand in the way of passing the treshhold of being from being decent to good-thus i cannot recommend spending money with 80+ ms. I honestly, dont recommend playing a PF,CT, C if your Ping is that high (not  because its not possible, it is, but it is not rewarding you will have to work twice as hard as westcoast counterparts).

												If you play this game it's gonna be frustrating if you don't have people to play & coordinate with on your team.  You have a team of 3 & you only control 1 character.  The other 2 are based on either AI mechanics that you have no say over, or other players in your party.  You can ask the AI to pass you the ball but they don't always comply due to the situation.  This game would be a lot better if you could control the AI members of your party.  Don't expect a normal single player B-Ball gaming experience for that very reason.  You need to make a team of real people to actually win games easily.  The AI won't do more advanced manuevers often like the ones they show you in the tutorial either.  They just dribble, pass, shoot.  Sometimes they won't even go for the ball when it's loose & they'll get it stolen when they have it.Controller support is also lacking.  No D-Input support, so you better have an X-Input controller.  Even then it's still confusing as hell because the game is based purely on Keyboard & you have to look up the button maps online to know what button does what.Graphics are good, the game is half-court basketball with official rules.  So it's a decent half court b-ball sim game. The music is probably the best part of the game.  ""We be ballin'!""  I gotta say this soundtrack is really catchy & fits the game almost perfectly for an outside half-court b-ball game.Overall after playing this game a few hours (outside of Steam) it's a good game IF you have 2 other people to play it with, but since I don't have 2 friends to play with my experience was sour. The AI is mediocre at best & difficult to coordinate with.  If you play this game definitely play with friends.  If you don't have friends interested in playing it with you then you might as well not play it at all.			"

												Ok, so where should i start ?1. Once you actually start the game you have absolutly no idea what you have to do, or whatever you actually can do. You just see lots and lots of buttons on your screen and noone is going to explain you what to do. Sure, the Tutorial teaches you the basics of the actual gameplay, but thats it.2. After some try outs you finaly found out how to start Matches with other Players...but oh wait...noone is gonna play with you, because youre a noob....and yes you are on the beginner server, but noone really cares, they just kick you out....constantly. 3. If you somehow manage to get in a game, and you are really about to play....forget everything you know about Basketball buddy...teamplay ? pff this is the internet !!! If you dont have the Ball right off the start, ull never gonna get it again...at least not from your teammates that is. Your only chance to get the Ball is to make some lucky Rebounds or Steals, but passing the Ball seems to be somewhat prohibited in this game. so yes, after a little more of an hour i managed to join 15 Rooms, got kicked out of 14 instantly, had 1 match with other People and never got a pass. All you gonna hear is "" pass the ball "" spamming from your teammates, eventhough they gonna ignore you once they get the ball. If you like this kind of "" Ego-Imthegreatest13yokiddyeva "" Game, go ahead and waste your time.			"

												This is *very close* to being good. But it just isn't. It's clunky, the controls are somewhat uncomfortable and not smooth at all. Using a controller/gamepad should be the default, you'd think- but the game is made for keyboards and it seems gamepad support was an afterthought. The game is also horribly laggy.Every screen packs in as many 'look! buy this shiny crap!' buttons as possible. All that being said, I think you should still at least give it a shot, since it's free and can provide a little bit of 3-on-3 fun. But don't expect for this to be the 'NBA Live Online' MMO you've always dreamed of.			"

												Okay this will be my review for FreeStyle2: (Opinion Based) <ReadAwayHaters>[Brief Introduction]i played the first version of this game back in my childhood and it was really fun although i am not a basketball fan freestyle will always have the top spot on my sportgames list until something comes out in the category but alas i will say this i am no fan of any sport games as i lean myself towards Roleplay and Mobas.this game died out on me as time passed because it wasnt really getting any interesting apart that my friends only played Ragnarok back then so without noticing i was drifted away from this game. (""10""? years) later [Maybe]i as a steam user check frequently on Free2Play Games and stumbled upon this game once more and decided to give it a try, i then told my friends about this gem of a game and sooner than we expected we were hooked to this game.if it werent for the competitiveness (and maybe) because i have fun with my friends i would personally set this game aside.and so 45Hours into the game i decided to make a review about this game, here are my Pros and Cons[PROS]<Competition>:: this game offers more than what you would expect and since it is a street basketball game each match will keep you sweating and shouting for better plays<Basketball>:: who doesnt love a good ol'Basketball game<Style>:: ability to choose what you look before going into a match to distinguish your character makes you feel great and awesome, who wouldnt want to go in looking fabulous?<Suspense>:: anything can happen within the match, i have encountered many times a great comeback<Reminiscence>:: remembering freestyle 1 and how far its gone is a great achievement for this game as i have never expected nor did it cross my mind to come back after all these years<Teamwork>:: you need 100% teamwork, so what if you keep getting those 3pts, hogging the ball will get you no where.i personally always play with my friends as we are always on skype to get better communication and coordination but playing with people you know you wouldnt need to say anything because they know how you play so all you need to do is give a signal and do the play<Something New>:: Mobas here and there, isnt it getting boring? FreeStyle 2 did the right choice to go on steam{CONS}>LAG<:: Yes, i am from the asian side of the world so most asians will understand my pain that we are having a hard time playing this game due to connection problems and sudden delays.>Elitists<:: you wont have fun as an SG i guarantee you that. you will be criticized>Unorganized Menus<:: its easy to understand and navigate BUT too messy in my opinion>Control Change<:: give us freedom to change these CONTROLS"" http://steamcommunity.com/app/339610/discussions/0/618458030676990749/ "" those of you who would like to support the Controls please bump this.[Other Concerns]-other than that i have no problem with the game.fix the asian servers asap.-This is my Review as of now. this may change or vary depending on how the game will turn out in the future4/12/2015			"

												When I saw this, I was hoping for a competent street basketball game with some paid character customizations and some kinda gross paid stat boosts. What I found instead was a poorly translated storefront with a terrible basketball game attached.Best I can tell, you are forced to control your character with the keyboard rather than a gamepad, which seems an odd choice for a basketball game. The rules of the game (both in terms of the rules in the rulebook and the way basketball works) are implemented very simplisticly. For example, if you want to block a shot, You'll need to be sure you're in front of the shooting player. It's literally impossible to block a short from the side or from behind. It feels like a board game implementation of basketball, and, as much as I like board games, the beauty of video games is that the game can juggle as many rules and variables as you can throw at it. Board games have to be simplified because people have to manage all those rules themselves. For a game as dynamic as basketball, this implementation doesn't create a very satisfying experience.The UI is ridiculous. Every screen has dozens of buttons labeled mostly with cryptic icons. As a new player, you'll be given several reward items after logging in, but you'll have no idea what they are or why you would want them. In this way, the game is extremely hostile to new players.If there is any fun to be had in this game, it's well hidden behind a smokescreen of odd design decisions and mechanisms designed to get you to give them money.

												Coming from a old Freestyle player, this is a nice little treat.My thoughts:GOOD:- Teamwork required.- Scoring feels satisfying.- Costumization.- Good latency and lag compensation.- Crew/Team Matches- Easy to get into, hard to master.- If you're good at the game in terms of skill you'll notice you beat people with a lot of P2W stuff but you'll probably lose anyways.- Achievement system, challenges, bingo, My Ball, freestyles and other stuff to keep you busy.- MVP Rewards, the player that contributes more to the game/team gets awarded for it even if you lose.BAD:- Leveling is slow.- No filters to sort out rooms.- The game doesn't kick players that just stay there AFK (ex. You open a room and stay with it open forever without starting any game).- No ""click a button"" Auto-Matchmaking to avoid room problems.- It seems like there's low playerbase some times.- A bunch of P2W stuff that you need to get better.- Menus are a little confusing for new players but you'll get used to it.- Should have a better introduction.- Servers have problems, be sure you play on your closest region or you'll find yourself DCing or having lag problems.*Overall it's really fun but difficult to get good at and understand how the game and systems work, give it a try!

												If you get this game, prepare to get your♥♥♥♥♥raped by high level players and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ connections.Game has poor servers, and wise matchmaking. There is no middle ground, so as soon as you leave newbie, you are pitted against lvl 100's. Waste of time tbh.			"

												If you use teamspeak do not install this game unless you are willing to embark on a journey that will take you to the inner depths of your registry files to find a singular issue that cant even be fixed unless a system restore is started. The game itself is ok, I'd give it a 6/10 but the teamspeak issue brings it down to 0/10. My teamspeak files are permanently corrupted even with a fresh install and I'm not willing to factory restore to play a moderately ok basketball game. My teamspeak will never be the same. Letters are now random signs, icons have turned into numbers and the very foundation of my voice-chatting has been irreparably damaged. This game ruined my life, do not install until it is patched.

												I am Eye. OBT Player.This game just went open beta when i went to search for FS1. So i decided to play the new FS2 instead. The mechanics is way different & more fluent/realistic.I didn't start alone though. I called a few friends to come & play with me, next thing you know, we enjoyed the game so much, we made our first max level. So after hitting max level, i made a new position & repeated that process til i made every position to 50. Besides the server/ping issue going around, the community was somewhat easy to connect with.I'll recommend this for anyone whose into sport game & connecting with people. "

												I liked it. Bitcoin miner ? I really dont know what that is, but my anti virus (the one that comes with windows 10, the windows defender) didnt said anything and he is really good. Anyway, its NOT A PAY TO WIN GAME.I have been playing for a couple hours and i saw alot of people in-game, with gear and pets. Its not that different, yes, it gives u status but is nothing that high and you can play normal. Of course you will get rekt by some players 'cuz they play better than you (and than me, 'cuz i suck).Anyway, a very nice game. :)			"

Freestyle2 is a free to play MMO basketball game which is both awesome and nerve-wracking. First, I'll get into the positives and then I'll rant about the major issues.To begin with, it's a street basketball, thus, it's played on one basket, there are no fouls, free throws, etc. Matches last 5 minutes, they have overtimes and replays. I won't be going into the details about the basketball itself because it's self-explanatory. Next, in order to jump into the match, you must pick a position and a character which is customizable to an extent. Then you'll be launched into a really confusing lobby screen with tons of options. You'll notice card sets, toys (mascots), sh*tload of events, etc.. Next, there's training mode which is essential for a newbie. You'll get a chance to practice every ability of your chosen position. Those skills, if not yet acquired, will be available to buy in skill shop as you level up. For more flashy jukes you can try equipping freestyles.So the main problem with this game from my experience is the skill gap. Once you get out of the rookie channel you'll be greeted by max level veterans with best skills available, proficiency and a sh*tty attitude towards newcomers. The community is so cancerous (most of the time) that only Russians in CS:GO can compete against them. The gap is huge and you'll be roasted multiple times and lose the majority of your matches, I can guarantee that since it isn't an easy game.Secondly, there are a lot of microtransactions which aren't just for a cosmetic look. You can get stuff like new characters with additional skill points, buffed items and other stuff which affects your stats and gives you an advantage. Though it's possible to get them without spending real money, it's pretty tough to do so.Lastly, there are many bugs, freezes and connection stability issues and they show up pretty often. Besides, many people state that there's a bitcoin miner inside the game files..  that's a first.TL;DRPros:● Fun gameplay● Challenging● A wide choice of clothes, accessories, cards, toys, skills..● Many events● Exhilarating musicCons:● Pay2win-ish● Many bugs, freezes, connection issues● Leaning towards unbalance● Bitcoin miner inside the game● Unchangeable character appearance except for clothes, accessories and hair● Crappy communityOverall, this game is fun and competitive but has so many problems and a wasted potential.8/10 "

												Hello All! I am known as Sinth, Cyntherea, BuckTucker and Persephone♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in this community. I have played the FSSB Series since its inception in North America.  History of Freestyle. [ http]In late 2006 I started playing the Sierra Online Alpha version when it hit North America. I was instantly hooked. The pace of this game and the intricicies involved in ""Pro"" play are what keeps me engaged.We cannot compare this version of Freestyle with the versions that came before it so I will review FSSB2 on it's own merits.Review:This is a F2P game. You don't have to pay anything to get started and you don't have to pay anything to be ""pro"".  Create your character: Power Forward, Center, Small Forward, Shooting Guard, Point Guard.  It helps to have a basic understanding of Basketball to understand what these positions mean. You get a few default characters, with different stats based on position. Their are ""Special Characters"" or SPC's that you can buy with real money that have enhanced stats. What some people fail to realize is that if you are a ""Free Player"", that means NOT SPENDING $$$, you get a FREE SPC at level 50. So, no. you don't have to pay to get a Special Character. People that play this game are gonna say, ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Sinth/Buck what about having to pay for extra skill slots?"" Yes, extra skill slots cost $$$. My answer is, that if you want/NEED those then you are already high enough level or dedicated enough to ""need"" them. You can absolutely play without spending money. I have several alts that don't spend a dime and do just fine.Now the the F2P/P2P thing is out of the way, onto the game.This is an arcadey Street Basketball game with cartoony graphics and has an urban flavor.  If you like fast paced sports action and have a need for twitch reflexology, then I can't recommend this game enough. If you hate childish, racist, ageist (I'm 40 years old) smacktalk... Uh... Look elsewhere. The community is harsh. Most of the community is 20ish... some older, most younger, and most very immature. Please don't let them get to you. Apparantly, IRL people talk trash on the court. I don't get it because I don't hoop IRL and haven't since the early 1990's...anyway...Graphics: 6/10-Cartoony characters, weird looking pets (pets give you + to attributes), odd outfitsSound: 6/10- I turn off in game music and run Pandora in the background. People like to spam their emotes... BTW guys... super annoying.Gameplay: 9/10- This game is all about timing, coordination and using skills wisely. It gets it right (PF's are OP but meh, I main PF), the classes are fun and true to their real life counterparts.Fun Factor: 1-10- It's not a lot of fun to play with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's fun to play with people that at least try. Don't be an elitist and you will have more fun.I currently have 3 level 50's, 3 more toons in pro around level 40 and several other stragglers. Hit me up in-game and seek out Team Bruh if you are looking for a Crew (Club/Clan). I will be in rookie on a C, I look forward to seing you all and have FUN!Also: I have always played with a controller. I do not play with a keyboard, if you can... I am amazed.Signed,BuckTucker - TeamBruh "

												I would definatly recommend this game. Its really fun and the skills and tricks you can do are aweome too. *_* So many different Slam Dunks you can do. The game is pretty balanced and you don't need to spend real money to look good. 10/10. The only things that are annoy me are no controller support, bad team mates driving me crazy, sometimes lag and blocking at times >.<. Other than that its a really good game. I made a tutorial on how to use a controller over here!

												For a free to play basketball game. I recommend this. It is a mixture of different elements in the basketball game. The game makes 3v3 a challenge that you have to overcome using skills and strategy to make a basket and if you successfully make a basket you can humiliate your opponent with a taunt. Not to mension you can also customize your character and show off while wearing the latest trend. Well develop game. I recommend this game to people who love not only basketball but for people who are looking for enhance in the basketball game.			"

												Freestyle part 1 was a great free basketball game that made sense. This newer version concerns me and my team. There are lag cheaters all over the place, unexplainable turnovers, ridiculous shots over covered defenders and an entire laundry list of other problems. My team was one of the best at part 1, however, part 2 has us thinking about uninstalling and playing something else. The cheaters in this game cheat because they know nothing will happen to them and they take this game as being a joke. JCEntertainment if it ain't broke do not fix it! Please bring back part 1.			"

												i would not recommend this game if you want a basketball simulator. this game isn't realistic, the special character (especially the newest) somehow has this ""magical"" abilities (not making this up, look at my hours on record) that makes them better.also the worst community i've ever seen, you could made the best performance you've ever done, and then messed up once that made u lose, you'll be blamed. And the worst part of it, they'll announce your nickname saying like ""kick this ""username"" he's noob"".this game is glitchy and lags a lot, the loading screen is so long and sometimes it crashed.the only thing that keeps me playing is it's free to play (i love basketball), they keep making interesting events (lately they've been giving free SPCs) and it's kinda challenging. It's better than Freestyle 1 in shops and movement.5/10			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but it is broken as hell...1. Almost no players, you either go up against someone completely trash or someone with no life and uses P2W features.2. SG and PF is broken, they're far too OP against the other positions, no reason to play PG, SF or C. (SG never misses 3pt and PF can rebound and dunk just as good as C also they're faster.3. I'm uninstalling this♥♥♥♥♥♥and going back to NBA2K.4. Feels I was scammed even if the game is free.5. Do not install this crap, it might seem fun at first, but after a while you will realize that you have wasted time and it feels like your soul is ripped from your body.			"

												It's a very nice basketball game that confuses me with its controls and annoys me with its voice acting. I've only played a few games with one of my friends and both of us after that we're saying nothing but ""COME ON OINKER, PASS THE BALL!"". Seriously it drove me insane. After that I never touched the game ever again, not because I'm not into basketball, but because the menu is difficult to navigate and all the little extras that they have is confusing and something I just don't see myself wasting my time on.This is one of those times where I wish Steam would add a ""meh"", ""in between"" or ""average""  button instead of just a ""recommend"" or ""don't recommend"".

												For a free to play basketball game. I recommend this. It is a mixture of different elements in the basketball game. The game makes 3v3 a challenge that you have to overcome using skills and strategy to make a basket and if you successfully make a basket you can humiliate your opponent with a taunt. Not to mension you can also customize your character and show off while wearing the latest trend. Well develop game. I recommend this game to people who love not only basketball but for people who are looking for enhance in the basketball game.			"

												This is by far the greatest sports game that I have played that is free. The game runs smoothly and the graphics are fine. This game is a 3v3 street basketball game (as shown in the title) that allows you to create your own player. Although you can't change your character's actual body appearance, you can change their clothing, hair style, hats, earings, etc. You can develop your charcter however you want by selecting which attributes you want to upgrade and what skills you want on your player. There are some clothing and characters you can't unlock unless you have money, but other than that everything else is free. It would be certainly worth your time to try this game out.			"

												Freestyle part 1 was a great free basketball game that made sense. This newer version concerns me and my team. There are lag cheaters all over the place, unexplainable turnovers, ridiculous shots over covered defenders and an entire laundry list of other problems. My team was one of the best at part 1, however, part 2 has us thinking about uninstalling and playing something else. The cheaters in this game cheat because they know nothing will happen to them and they take this game as being a joke. JCEntertainment if it ain't broke do not fix it! Please bring back part 1.			"

Product received for free
												I have put a lot, and I mean A LOT of time into this game, I've been playing it for over a year so I think I've got enough knowledge about this game to finally review/talk it. First, I would like to say that I have not spent a single penny on this game, not because I don't want to support it, but because I'm still a student with no job, so this will all be how it goes from a £0 experience. Now, this game is really fun, it has 3 a side street basketball where you play with people online, you can choose one of 8 positions (5 main ones plus 3 special positions which makes the game a lot more fun) I have dabbled in each class, the best for me being a Short Forward and a Swing Man. It has a lot of skills in the game, each class getting a different set depending on their role, but also allowing them to extend what they can do, for example, my main SF is also really good at passing and assisting like a Point Guard. You unlock these as you level up your separate characters, skills do not transfer between characters so every time you make a new one it will be like starting over again. Something else that doesn't go between characters is your inventory (Unless it's a character coupon) so everything you get with a character can't be used with another, which is really good as you can't make a new character but give them clothes or cards that a level 50 (Max level) character would use. What does go between characters is points and money (Points being things you get after a game and money being what you buy with real money) so you may be able to buy a skill (which use regular points) as soon as you unlock it instead of having to wait for you to get more money. What also is between characters would be sponsors (Being exp, points and VIP) which gives you a boost in what you get after a match. You can get these by either buying them or getting them dropped through one of the many events that take place. The main downside to this game is that I live in England but my friend who I play with lives in America, meaning that if we decide to play together, one of us will have to sacrifice some ping to go to the other server, luckily the account goes between severs so I can play in Europe server with my characters while not playing with my friend and level them up.All in all, this game is really fun and I recommend it to anyone that wants a basketball game to play with friends but doesn’t have a lot of money, but you can always spend money if you want. You can always win if you are good enough, so just practice and have fun! "

												Good f2p game. I use it when I want some casual PVP.+ Game promotes teamplay. Pick'n'rolls, open threes, big guys spreading the floor, it's all there, and you actually get this nice feeling like in RL ball game when team play goes well.+ Nice position differences give you different angles of gameplay (don't play C or PF if your ping is high, you will suck at rebounding)+ Real money needed only if you really decided to go hardcore and need those extra skill slots.So if you like basketball and you're okay with this comix graphic style you should give this game a try.

												Ever since I pressed play I fell in love with this game, ever since I was a kid I grew up on the street basketball games, and when I found this I felt like I was at home again. This game provides me hours of fun day to day and I simply can't stop playing it. The community for the most part is amazing, and the game itself is even better. If you like sports games, then you'll most definitely love this game.			"

												Good f2p game. I use it when I want some casual PVP.+ Game promotes teamplay. Pick'n'rolls, open threes, big guys spreading the floor, it's all there, and you actually get this nice feeling like in RL ball game when team play goes well.+ Nice position differences give you different angles of gameplay (don't play C or PF if your ping is high, you will suck at rebounding)+ Real money needed only if you really decided to go hardcore and need those extra skill slots.So if you like basketball and you're okay with this comix graphic style you should give this game a try.

												Absolutely NOT Pay2Win if you want to have fun and win. The only ""necessary"" spending total around USD20 on 4 extra skill slots in order to maximize gameplay potential. It is only effective when you are commited to go PRO (~lvl 40+), you don't have to spend a dime to be good at this game.Each game lasts <10 minutes (Forfeit option is available).The community should welcome players from all skill levels. Expect trash talking at higher level games (common phenomenon). Freestyle should grow for the better since Steam launch, unless the developer side don't accomodate for the expansion.I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys basketball or sports in general. Great fun!			"

												Every year, as soon as the cold weather sets in, my hands become dry and flaky. With flu and cold season in full swing, I turn to excess hand washing, which always strips the moisture from my skin. To slough off dead skin cells and restore moisture, I make a batch of exfoliating sea salt hand scrub and keep it by my kitchen sink to enjoy all winter long.Though it's perfectly acceptable to keep this scrub to yourself, it also makes a great gift to give around the holidays. It's remarkably easy to throw together, so as long as you have all (three) of the ingredients on hand, you can whip up a quick batch. It's a thoughtful, customizable alternative to store-bought gifts, and ensures you'll never show up empty-handed to a party or dinner again.What You NeedSupplies1 cup coarse sea salt1/2 cup liquid coconut oil5 to 7 drops grapefruit essential oilEquipmentDry measuring cups10-ounce glass container (I used a Weck canning jar)ForkInstructionsGrab your supplies. You'll need 1 cup coarse sea salt, 1/2 cup liquid coconut oil, 5 to 7 drops of grapefruit essential oil, and a 10-ounce glass container.Add the salt. Pour 1 cup of salt into the empty glass container.Add the oil. Pour 1/2 cup of coconut oil over the salt.Add essential oil. Add 5 to 7 drops of grapefruit essential oil to mixture.Stir the mixture. Stir all ingredients until well combined.Seal and gift. Seal the jar and affix a label or gift tag to the top.Recipe NotesUse scrub sparingly — about once or twice a week — by spooning a small amount into your hands, gently rubbing it in, rinsing it off with warm water, and drying your hands thoroughly.I tried (and failed) to wrap both ribbon and twine around this jar. (It was so slippery!) To save your sanity, just affix a label, tag, or bow to the top of the jar.			"

												Waste of time. Ignore the fact that the initial loading screen takes 5-10 minutes for God knows why. Ignore the fact that the UI is dog vomit. Ignore the usual P2W tropes, because they are all here and there is nothing to be said for it that hasn't already been said a thousand times for P2P games.I understand this is ""street ball"" as the term is used by the community as an excuse for how terrible competitive play is. The actual gameplay still doesn't make sense. 3 Point shots are made 90% of the time regardless of how much Defense is on the shooter, so the entire community just dribbles for 20 minutes and chucks up the ball from behind the perimeter and it just goes in inexplicably. Defense is TRASH on this game. Most of the blocks in this game are goal tends, meaning the person can just swat the ball way after its already coming down towards the goal. You can do this thing where you try to square up to your openent with your arms out, but that does jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ as the offensive dribble animations are so jerky and sudden they will always have space to chuck up a shot with 90% chance of it falling. There is absolutely NO reason to put attribute points into any defensive stat. I'm harping on defense because if the game had it, it would potentially be competitive. But it's just, ""Let me arbitrarily move around near my opponent and hope the tilted RNG will let their ugly randomly thrown shot that im contesting miss."" I've watched games where everyone is pro-level and it's still the same. do ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dribble animation and toss ball from 3 point line.Calling it Streetball isn't an excuse to have severely unbalanced gameplay. P.S Community actually gets upset at you if you don't just chuck up 3's the entire time as a SG. You arent allowed to drive or take an open 2. Even if you make it, You get called a ""Bad SG"". Even if you get an offensive rebound near the rim they expect you to dribble back out over the perimeter to chuck a 3. Why are we even allowed to put points in other attribute categories, then? ♥♥♥♥ it, uninstalled.""Steph Curry: The Game"" gets a 2/10 from me. "

												UPDATED REVIEW (07/07/15) :------------------------------------------------------About the games flaws;This game includes 2 different game :)a) before level 40, easy enjoyable, you can be Kobe, Lebron (you think so :)b) after level 40 when you face the real players including very high skill guys, very good teams, very heavy pay to win guys. You will be shocked after playing against these guys, you will think they are cheating, you will be frustrated, may be you will quit playing the game. Now you are the ultimate rookie by getting to this point.*  before level 40 this game may seem easy, but it is not. So after becoming level 40 and even being  a level 50, with good piece of equipment, you are so weak. (Put aside the P2W equipment, cards which some of the cards you can aquire with in game currency and events, but the best clothes are time limited, so you need to pay real cash to make them permanent.) The real problem YOU STILL HAVE NO IDEA about this game. Passing at the right time, finding the free teammate, when to fake, when to drive, when to shoot, All of them requires deep knowledge about the game play and big experience. Average player needs thousands of games to be a competetive ""level 50"", and for each different position you still need additional experience.* You need a good team, or a good crew. And the friendship mechanics, crew mechanics are awful in this game. So basic like designed for handheld basic nintendo.* You find a good guy, he knows about this game, so you be friends. But only with that position, you have no idea about his other chars. At some point you have 5 chars and you time to time play with each other like all the other guys who are into the game. So there SHOULD be a main CHAR NAME, so by only interaction with that char will be enough to communicate with players all other chars.* The Crew Function ( Basicly your TEAM, CLAN,...) , totally awful, as a crew master, you have so limited options. You can not classify, sort, you can do nothing usefull. You can only delegate managers, accept players, or kick players out of crew. You have to spend enormous time to have a good crew, you have to know each player well, that is not practicable. YOU MUST HAVE (as a crew master) ability to see player stats, I dont mean attribs, but total stats or monthly stats, as you can see yours. I think you can not even see the level of your crew members (LOL), you can see this during their application only. You can not see inactive players, as you can not sort anything. YOU CAN NOT assaign them titles like, ROOKIE, VETERAN, PRO or whatsoever to classify them, which is a must in a serious clan, crew based mmo.* The games lottery system, prize system so rigged. Lots of times you will get very piece of junk items like 100 points or even blank. If the system briefly tell you there is high chance of getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ items IT IS OKAY. But you see the WHEEL OF FORTUNE for example, there is lets say 24 pieces, 1 of them is 100 points (smallest prize), you turn it 10 times and 5 times you get 100 points, come on this is BS! than put more piece and increase number of 100 points. This is like  slot machines with cheating mechanisms, casino wins all the time :)* Information given by the game, about almost everthing is SO SMALL. Like 3 point attribute, 3 point success rate, which one is what ??? Which one includes what, which is better ? NO INFO ! What about Tussle, who needs tussle , what is that, ??? So you will spend your valuable points on stats you will never need, because you have no idea.* There should be some graphical improvements like antialias may be?* There should be optimisation of network code. Still we have disconnects from match loading screens, match would not start for multiple tiries. Some lags which affects gameplay, a player 3 meters left of you can block you with the help of Mr.Spock with a teleportation.So final state of the game : Pros:+ Still Great gameplay+ Seems like devs are listening players after steam+ Some of the problems are sorted out after steam release+ Old the pros are valid from first reviewCons:- Still P2W.- Big gap after level 40 with high levels, gap with experienced or/and p2w players. - Awful friendship interface, lacking of an appointed main char for general relations and comms.- Awful Crew system.- Flawed lottery system.- Lack of information about the game (stats,...)- Need improved graphics.- Need better network code.OLD REVIEW:---------------------------------I have been playing this game during OBT. I have 1 level 50 SF, lvl 36 C, lvl 27 SG, lvl 5 PF. Also I had played FS1 long time ago. So do not mind the steam play time.First things first, this game is PAY TO WIN (P2W). With earned points you can purchase items, which will give you around +5 attrib, but if you purchase item with real money you can go up to +13 or even +18 (so this is the pay to win aspect of the game) (Also there is the toy thing which can be P2W)(you will encounter PG who can steal all your balls, really annoying, a balance issue much more than P2W although P2W makes them so strong at stealing)Aside from this, I definitely recommend this game, because it is SO MUCH FUN. You can level up to level 50 (final), and build a good player, you can compete with others (wallet warriors). You can compete with others by Team PLAY and SKILL.So if you have a good team, crew, friends. YES YOU WILL ENJOY THIS GAME.IF you like basketball, yes you will enjoy this game. BEWARE you can NOT be a jordan or kobe, trying so will gain you only FRUSTRATION. You need team play, if you are high level, with good items and skills, yes you can be KOBE :) , MJ not so sure :))PRO+ Nice graphics+ Basketball online at best+ 3 divisions according to your level, so you dont get smashed by high levels+ If you understand the game and be a team player, SUPER FUNCONS- P2W- Need somehow good ping- OBT players can be a bit unfriendly ( they do not have the patience for rookies, noobs)- Difficult to understand core game mechanics for a newbei (including cards, toys and GAMEPLAY)*- After steam release, game is experiencing lag which I have encountered 1 in a 50 games series during OBT. So this is an issue now.* A major con was the low player base, I hope it will change with steam, this game deserves it.OVERALL: 7.5/10  ( a great game, if it was not P2W, it would be a 9 )YES I DO RECOMMEND, no body is perfect :) BTW I see most of negative reviews is due to absence of SEA server ( so this guys want this game to fail, instead of earning money and starting a sea server)			"

												- The game is great. But, this game can't handle lagger. They just warp around the court. It's reall annoying.- The items bind to the character, not the account. It's not fair for the player. The game should make the item bind to account. But one item can be used by one character. This seems to be fair.- Really high price for item mall.If you can accept the above list, you can play this game happily.			"

												Gameplay is really fun and competitive, especially when the team is working together even though it's a ""PUG"". only downside is asia server is currently unstable and lag alot, which makes alot of asia player to play in North America server instead. Though it doesn't affect too much but if you're using a Center or PF position the ping matters. =.=Overall a good game and being able to swag out your character makes it even better. I made a big black guy, gave him Blonde hair and slapped on a pair of fancy glasses and then named him FatJ. ♥♥♥♥♥ He's Fabulous, Don't judge.			"

												UPDATED REVIEW (07/07/15) :------------------------------------------------------About the games flaws;This game includes 2 different game :)a) before level 40, easy enjoyable, you can be Kobe, Lebron (you think so :)b) after level 40 when you face the real players including very high skill guys, very good teams, very heavy pay to win guys. You will be shocked after playing against these guys, you will think they are cheating, you will be frustrated, may be you will quit playing the game. Now you are the ultimate rookie by getting to this point.*  before level 40 this game may seem easy, but it is not. So after becoming level 40 and even being  a level 50, with good piece of equipment, you are so weak. (Put aside the P2W equipment, cards which some of the cards you can aquire with in game currency and events, but the best clothes are time limited, so you need to pay real cash to make them permanent.) The real problem YOU STILL HAVE NO IDEA about this game. Passing at the right time, finding the free teammate, when to fake, when to drive, when to shoot, All of them requires deep knowledge about the game play and big experience. Average player needs thousands of games to be a competetive ""level 50"", and for each different position you still need additional experience.* You need a good team, or a good crew. And the friendship mechanics, crew mechanics are awful in this game. So basic like designed for handheld basic nintendo.* You find a good guy, he knows about this game, so you be friends. But only with that position, you have no idea about his other chars. At some point you have 5 chars and you time to time play with each other like all the other guys who are into the game. So there SHOULD be a main CHAR NAME, so by only interaction with that char will be enough to communicate with players all other chars.* The Crew Function ( Basicly your TEAM, CLAN,...) , totally awful, as a crew master, you have so limited options. You can not classify, sort, you can do nothing usefull. You can only delegate managers, accept players, or kick players out of crew. You have to spend enormous time to have a good crew, you have to know each player well, that is not practicable. YOU MUST HAVE (as a crew master) ability to see player stats, I dont mean attribs, but total stats or monthly stats, as you can see yours. I think you can not even see the level of your crew members (LOL), you can see this during their application only. You can not see inactive players, as you can not sort anything. YOU CAN NOT assaign them titles like, ROOKIE, VETERAN, PRO or whatsoever to classify them, which is a must in a serious clan, crew based mmo.* The games lottery system, prize system so rigged. Lots of times you will get very piece of junk items like 100 points or even blank. If the system briefly tell you there is high chance of getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ items IT IS OKAY. But you see the WHEEL OF FORTUNE for example, there is lets say 24 pieces, 1 of them is 100 points (smallest prize), you turn it 10 times and 5 times you get 100 points, come on this is BS! than put more piece and increase number of 100 points. This is like  slot machines with cheating mechanisms, casino wins all the time :)* Information given by the game, about almost everthing is SO SMALL. Like 3 point attribute, 3 point success rate, which one is what ??? Which one includes what, which is better ? NO INFO ! What about Tussle, who needs tussle , what is that, ??? So you will spend your valuable points on stats you will never need, because you have no idea.* There should be some graphical improvements like antialias may be?* There should be optimisation of network code. Still we have disconnects from match loading screens, match would not start for multiple tiries. Some lags which affects gameplay, a player 3 meters left of you can block you with the help of Mr.Spock with a teleportation.So final state of the game : Pros:+ Still Great gameplay+ Seems like devs are listening players after steam+ Some of the problems are sorted out after steam release+ Old the pros are valid from first reviewCons:- Still P2W.- Big gap after level 40 with high levels, gap with experienced or/and p2w players. - Awful friendship interface, lacking of an appointed main char for general relations and comms.- Awful Crew system.- Flawed lottery system.- Lack of information about the game (stats,...)- Need improved graphics.- Need better network code.OLD REVIEW:---------------------------------I have been playing this game during OBT.

												Waste of time. Ignore the fact that the initial loading screen takes 5-10 minutes for God knows why. Ignore the fact that the UI is dog vomit. Ignore the usual P2W tropes, because they are all here and there is nothing to be said for it that hasn't already been said a thousand times for P2P games.I understand this is ""street ball"" as the term is used by the community as an excuse for how terrible competitive play is. The actual gameplay still doesn't make sense. 3 Point shots are made 90% of the time regardless of how much Defense is on the shooter, so the entire community just dribbles for 20 minutes and chucks up the ball from behind the perimeter and it just goes in inexplicably. Defense is TRASH on this game. Most of the blocks in this game are goal tends, meaning the person can just swat the ball way after its already coming down towards the goal. You can do this thing where you try to square up to your openent with your arms out, but that does jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ as the offensive dribble animations are so jerky and sudden they will always have space to chuck up a shot with 90% chance of it falling. There is absolutely NO reason to put attribute points into any defensive stat. I'm harping on defense because if the game had it, it would potentially be competitive. But it's just, ""Let me arbitrarily move around near my opponent and hope the tilted RNG will let their ugly randomly thrown shot that im contesting miss."" I've watched games where everyone is pro-level and it's still the same. do ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dribble animation and toss ball from 3 point line.Calling it Streetball isn't an excuse to have severely unbalanced gameplay. P.S Community actually gets upset at you if you don't just chuck up 3's the entire time as a SG. You arent allowed to drive or take an open 2. Even if you make it, You get called a ""Bad SG"". Even if you get an offensive rebound near the rim they expect you to dribble back out over the perimeter to chuck a 3. Why are we even allowed to put points in other attribute categories, then? ♥♥♥♥ it, uninstalled.""Steph Curry: The Game"" gets a 2/10 from me. "

												Seems to be a neat little game, easy to pick up, hard to master. Game works on teambase, meaning you have to work out who is going for who, and find a playstyle that suits you and the team. Like, do you want to be a tall guy for good defense. Or a fast guy that makes it easier to get the the ball passed at you. The crowd cheering and yelling, combined with the taunting you can do, Makes the competitve feeling pretty good. Getting you either♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and frustrated or satisfied to see them getting owned. If you like basketball games its deffinetly worth a try. If you don't, but like teambased sports, still worth a try. If your not interested in sports at all, then well... what are you doing here?

												A good sports game must have fluent animations (or at least ""feel"" fluent) and tight gameplay in general. The problem is that everything is tight to the point of feeling stiff and the animations are clunky as all hell. Not to mention that dispite it being a PC game, it does not use the mouse and instead uses the arrow keys to move. THE ARROW KEYS. Whatever is included in the controls right now could have easilly been replaced with proper WASD and left/right click bindings. You might be able to rebind them, maybe, I didn't really care enough to notice.Anyway, animations; good lord they are terrible. You run like the floor is ice, kind of hovering in place even though you are clearly taking a step forward. Trying to steal is pretty much impossible. Even the AI which is better than the average player can't steal.At least the game has some nice music and it looks okay. Though good luck seeing what character is on the screen. They kind of get lost in the chaos of black lines around everyone.Also the UI is terrible and the tutorial is laughable..			"

												This game was created to spread the idea of communism and I am not falling for it. Back in the 40s Mao Se Tung created this game to try to spread and infect the world with communism. He used the domino tactic and started the Vietnam war. China ended up suceeding in the spread to communism and even infected a U.S president John Franklin Kennedy. John Kennedy was a communism; who was implanted in the United States to transform the U.S into a communist state so we all had to give up our wages. Thank god for the hero LBJ who arranged his assassination and stopped him from destroying black supremacy, and the group called The Black Panthers. Most of the citizens dont know this story but here I am telling you. I used to work in the CIA and im retired now and I was involved with the Bay of the Pig Invasion. I was onto Kennedy from the start and knew everything he was doing like almost faking an attack of Cubans for reason to invade. People dont know this but Kennedy is an alien from Boötes I galaxy. He was sent here by his father Pagi Wqyz Mofi the leader of Crak Ek Efikupi and he was found in a space pod near Ulyanovsk and thats when the Russians raised him to become the leader of the United States.

												I'm not a sports fan whatsoever, apart from playing the occasional WWE video game every so often, I like to keep to other games, but this game has surprised me and made me a tad bit interested in basketball.After playing a few matches, I can say this is a pretty competent free-to-play game on Steam which can safely join the ranks of games like Warframe and Team Fortress 2. Graphically, it's not the best looking game but it has a distinct art style which you don't see in many free-to-play games, which I have to give them props for.Surprisingly a really fun game.Definitely pick this up if you're a sports fan or not, you should still get some enjoyment out of this!

												If you can get past the server issues the game is pretty good and has a large following.  The interface is a bit confusing and I still have no clue what some of the stuff does or what I should do with it but it's basketball and it's street basketball and that makes it a 10/10 for me.UPDATE:Well I have been playing a lot of team matches lately and I can say without a doubt the game is 150% P2W.  We played a team of bought players and we could not touch them, one guy scored all the points with a total of 36 points and they were all 3 pointers with NO misses at all.  I am done with this game.			"

												♥♥♥♥ing terrible. This game is literally, NBA 2K games with a Play-Pay 2 Win concept. The gameplay is God awful, has a lot of bugs which the devs will not even look into fixing; characters you pay to unlock have extra training points which gain you  an advantage over the other players who beat their asses to level up by playing with un-♥♥♥♥ing-beatable opponents, by the way they also implemented new positions so now you can play as multiple positions in one character! So there is no meaning of PGs or Cs anymore, SWs/CTs/DGs and other characters make up for ALL of the original positions. The skill system is also really ♥♥♥♥♥♥, they make you pay tons of credits that range from 2000 to tens of thousands but you gain only 75-120 per match if you don't have VIP or the other boosters. Oh by the way, YOU CAN PAY ACTUAL MONEY TO UNLOCK SKILL SLOTS. Another thing to point on, you can get special abilities added to your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ COSTUMES. These can be pass/steal/intercept etc. boosters and can also make you AVOID F*CKING SCREENS AND BLOCKS. ""Oh, did you try to block that last minute shot? MAYBE I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO BLOCK THAT."" There is also a ""card system"", which you can put different cards that boost your abilities by a bit in 3 different slots; offense, defense and talent. If you try to upgrade a card, you need to have 2 or more spray depending on the level of the card. You rarely get spray from boxes and gifts, and there is no way to get more other than, you guessed it, putting more credits to buy more spray which is damn expensive. By the way, I'm not somebody who played the game for a minute and left. I'm level 30, I played it enough to know what the minor and major issues this game has.Overall, I wouldn't recommend it. If you want to pour cash into the game to wreck newbies, fine. Go with it. Just keep in mind that you won't be able to progress really quickly unless you spend money.			"

												Best game in history. Every aspect of it screams perfection. When you first open up this beautiful masterpiece, you are immersed in the environment by means of its superlative soundtrack, it drowns out all other thought and just fuels the roaring fire that is the desire to play this game. When trying to navigate the menus, you are bombarded by its puzzle-like nature, making the time when you actually figure out what to do so magical. The character create screen prohibits the majority of names which allow one's creativity to shine, not only this, but the process itself is complex, no tips are given which proves it to be not for the faint of heart. The gameplay is unlike that of any other game I have experienced in my recently unfulfilled life, every aspect is flawless from the minimal controls to the minute amount of dialogue, which permits the focus on the important part; landing slamming dunks. Being immersed in a 200 ping world makes every move count which just adds to its brilliance. For such perfection to be free of cost is unimaginable, as there is not a price in the world high enough which would stop me from enjoying it. 420/69.			"

Another problem is there is that screepy security camera guy that doesnt make sense its like a dj camera guy.. and then theres the basketball grandpa and look at the dlc i wouldnt pay 280$ for a game even if it was good. Another problem is it should be able to launch i have a high end gaming pc and the title screen lags how does that happen.. I would be more harsh on it if i didnt get it as a joke because it looked so bad with the black grandpa and stuff.			"

												This game is fun, no doubt, but it's ruined by awful pay-to-win dynamics. If you have money, you can literally buy all the best skills and character points and you can dominate every single game with no skill at all. It's great if you get matched with regular players, but those paid players are everywhere and expect to get owned as ♥♥♥♥ every other game.			"

Dunk rating is higher than my friends and he dunks with like a 50 rating and mine is 180. Also his 3 pointers are really high and he can't make one. I have a low as ♥♥♥♥ three pointer shot rating. And I make every one. Second of all, the gameplay is horrible, it makes no sense. I try and block and my guy just falls on the ♥♥♥♥ing ground. This game is a such a money grab sack of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Free to play still made me feel like i lost money because of the sack of♥♥♥♥♥♥this is.

												So I am asuming you're one of those people that saw this game and thought ""Oh that looks cool to play with friends and have a bit of fun!""Well if you are one of those people. Stop. Stop thinking that right now, if you honestly like this game and have played it before and can handle the terrible controls and stupid commentary and foolish music choice then CONGRATS! You are the spawn of Satan and everything un-holy. BUT if you are a first timer and have NEVER played this before thinking it looked fun. Well it's not, it's a big pile of steaming crap, sat on your doorstep ready for you to un-knowingly stand on it when you step outside your door. Then the smell just lingers like a virus and honestly you regret all the decisions you have made in your life and want to go back to the womb and start over.3/10   The 3 is only there to make the creators feel good about themselves in some sort of way.

												IDK what it is, but this game has always been the most fun I had compared to even the 2k series, Live or any other basketball game out there. It is not super realistic, but it has so many moves and ways to customize a player that you build from the ground up. Its an RPG at the same time as being a great sports game. You feel like it is you at a park playing when you control your character, just very fun, very well done. The old freestyle 1 was great and now I am enjoying this sequel.+ RPG style progression mixed with sports+ Lots of cool skills to learn as you lvl up & items to equip for originality+ Great competition online vs. others & team work game- Pay to Win as you can purchase items to boost stats and buy special characters with money too- Ping is very important so if you are on East coast you cant rebound/block guys with lower ping in the west very easily, they beat you to the jump.- The Devs don't care much about their playerbase. Windows 10 took 4 months to get patched in, the only game I had trouble with and they knew about it 4 months too. No compensation or even a sorry to us.If they fixed ping and took away the P2W aspects it would be a perfect street ball game, how it is now, its a 6/10, but still recommend it to all bball fans.

												With solid, fast paced gameplay and an excellent presentation that's easily the best the series has ever had, Freestyle 2: Streetbasketball continues its strong pedigree of great basketball. While the presentation holds down the fort, the inclusion of the Street Today and My Player modes, as well as the addition of the developmental leagues make an already good title even better. While the technical issues, such as the slowdown and the legacy problems with the AI and shooting are dismaying, they don't completely destroy the on-court experience, which is still strong enough to allow FreeStyle to hold the basketball crown for yet another year.

												Very good game (isn't pay 2 win) and even after some hours you're still amazed of what you can do. You can buy almost every item with in game money and if it needs to be bought with real money, you can get it from a ig ball drop. No problem with crashes or some and a game only takes 5 min max. I really do recommend this game if you can't buy the NBA2k games and you want a good and amazing basketball game. =)			"

												Login is completely broken,Don't bother installing it until its fixed,  Waste of space.The uninstall button works 100%!UPDATE:  So far they made a recent Patch for the ""Login Problems""But as i've seen the comments to the latest patch for it.Doesn't look like it seems to be working.If they really want to make this an actual working game and really put steam support fully on this.At least make the game work for crying out loud,  this goes to the staff who works on the game.It doesn't ever works nor does the login even work everytime you login your accounts,You just sit in the main screen waiting & waiting over and over again,You may think its ""Fixed"" because you guys are most probably in a better place where you could connect to your ""Own Game""   I'm not gonna give an upvote till i actually see the fix working.

												The game itself is decent, but the controller support is implemented poorly.  The menus and inventories are horrible to navigate and the game constantly throws up splashscreens to try to get you to spend money.  If you plan on trying to play this with a controller I'd say don't bother, but if you just want to  play with a keyboard give it a shot and see if the game is for you.			"

												I young friend of mine begged me to install this so I gave it a go.It is terrible, right from the start with the ear-assaulting garbage music, to the incredibly frustrating and unintuitive menu and character selection screen that make you want to turn the thing off immediately.  Here is a little message for the developers: if your player selects some game mode (for me it was: tutorial) and wishes to exit that game mode, you should let them do that.  Typically this occurs by pressing ESC key to get to a menu.  In freestyle basketball you will not receive this courtesy, if you decide you want out, you are going to have to complete that tutorial.I somehow knew it was going to happen, but this was by far the worst gaming experience I have had in years.  There are plenty of decent free-to-play games out there.  This is not one of them.			"

Amazing potential ruined by clunky free 2 play interface, level up system and no joy pad support. I want this exact game but with a season mode, offline multiplayer, no level up system and a $15 price tag instead of the free2play sludge getting in the way. Would be great if they just made a game and nothing else. I'll pay in dollars.  "

												I have been playing this game since 2008 when it was still fs1 and i have good memories with this game, too bad we had to let go of our server and had to switch to a international server so we had hard time to cope up with the nations with faster internet speed, this game is not really a pay to win game, because you can get SPC characters and rare stuff with green item balls that you normally get after completing achievements and by logging in everyday for events. The only problem with game its a very game really depends on your internet speed to make you play better esp. when  you decide to be a Rebounder, internet speed is really a must but overall this game is a 9/10			"

												This game is a garbage watered down mess. It is awkward as fk, and everything is automated for you, there is no skill involved like the original. It goes without saying about the lag since its international. Freestyles and other things make no sense, menus are ugly and confusing. Instead of getting an attribute item like in the original, you get ""magic"" applied to things. What the ♥♥♥♥ is that♥♥♥♥♥♥ There is no skill involved, or incentive to level, as all the advanced skills from the first FS are given to you out the gate (Like Freewill for PF) and you automatically start as a position, instead of working towards it. This game is such trash, stay miles away. Pray they bring the original FS back.			"

												Freestyle 2 caters to both casual and hardcore audiences. The game's simple learning curve allows anyone to just jump in and start having fun. As for your main character, you get to choose from 5 positions (Point Guard, Shooting Guard, Small Forward, Power Forward, and Center).There are also 2 Competitive Modes: Team Match which is a 3v3, and Individual Mode is 1v1. Co-op vs AI mode is also available.If you’re a fan of basketball, there’s no reason you shouldn’t be playing this game. It’s generous, it gives you free stuff such as clothes and outfits on an almost daily basis, premium characters for free and an amazingly addictive gameplay experience to top it all off.			"

												There is no counter-play. If your stats are high, you will make shots in your opponent's face. Matchmaking is terrible. Always get placed against people who have been playing way longer than me. Passing doesn't even matter. You can take anybody in a 1 on 1 and easily score. Don't expect even a semi-realistic experience like I did. This comes nowhere close to even competing with 2K.Trash/10 never playing again.			"

												After getting up to lvl 15, I have only this to say.Fun game, try it, but never, EVER... Try to block me.Your ankles will be broken.*REAL REVIEW*Don't ge me wrong. This game isn't your average Basketball game *cough 2K13-15 cough*So If you are not used to the way the controls are set up, It's a game where the mouse is not at all required during a match. It would be useful to use the scroll as a shoot/hold button. But this game does have VERY LITTLE flaws. One flaw is the servers when in a 3V3. And other is the way when ever someone drives and you just see this blur. Oh wait... it's call KISS MY FAST! To be honest, If this was on all consoles *INCLUDING WII U, STOP DENYING* It would be another game to have fun with the family. And if you're black...""AWW COME ON MAN! YOUR CENTER STRAIGHT GOALTENDING LIKE A ♥♥♥♥♥ DAWG!""There is no reason anyone shouldn't be enjoying this game. If you don't have it, I have only one question for you:Can you hoop?			"

												I have been playing Freestyle since 2007, of course back then it was the original Freestyle Street Basketball by Sierra Online. Now we have the second installment of this series and it is great, there is no other game in the market that allows you to play team basketball with your friends like this one does.I think it has room for improvement but what doesn't? I really hope now being on Steam it will allow them to do greater things with this game, I totally recommend this to basketball fans, specially if you plan to play with friends.			"

												Well this game is pretty good but...There are some issues. It being focused on Team play mainly is pretty good but you know, you get those ball hogs that don't pass when you're open... facepalm. Anyway this game is good with 2 other friends, other than that there isn't more problems, its a great and fun game, pretty grind fested BUT though it might be grindy its still very enjoyable and not that boring. The only MASSIVE issue I have other than the team mates which isn't so bad is the lag. And its pretty dang big. I live in Australia so I have to play on the Asian servers since I get the best ping. I thought having 170 ping was good, nope. If you have over like 80 ping you can barely do good. Well I am not to sure about under 100 ping but over 100 its horrible. You get blocked on your shot all the time, even if you're open for a split second, INSTANT block EVEN THOUGH you shouldn't of been blocked. Same goes for rebounding, person has better ping they'll get it.So in the end its a great game but the ping and teammates is the only horrible part. PLEASE GET AN OCEANIC SERVER! "

												Freestyle 2 caters to both casual and hardcore audiences. The game's simple learning curve allows anyone to just jump in and start having fun. As for your main character, you get to choose from 5 positions (Point Guard, Shooting Guard, Small Forward, Power Forward, and Center).There are also 2 Competitive Modes: Team Match which is a 3v3, and Individual Mode is 1v1. Co-op vs AI mode is also available.If you’re a fan of basketball, there’s no reason you shouldn’t be playing this game. It’s generous, it gives you free stuff such as clothes and outfits on an almost daily basis, premium characters for free and an amazingly addictive gameplay experience to top it all off.			"

Amazing potential ruined by clunky free 2 play interface, level up system and no joy pad support. I want this exact game but with a season mode, offline multiplayer, no level up system and a $15 price tag instead of the free2play sludge getting in the way. Would be great if they just made a game and nothing else. I'll pay in dollars.  "

												The game itself is decent, but the controller support is implemented poorly.  The menus and inventories are horrible to navigate and the game constantly throws up splashscreens to try to get you to spend money.  If you plan on trying to play this with a controller I'd say don't bother, but if you just want to  play with a keyboard give it a shot and see if the game is for you.			"

												I have been playing this game since 2008 when it was still fs1 and i have good memories with this game, too bad we had to let go of our server and had to switch to a international server so we had hard time to cope up with the nations with faster internet speed, this game is not really a pay to win game, because you can get SPC characters and rare stuff with green item balls that you normally get after completing achievements and by logging in everyday for events. The only problem with game its a very game really depends on your internet speed to make you play better esp. when  you decide to be a Rebounder, internet speed is really a must but overall this game is a 9/10			"

												I young friend of mine begged me to install this so I gave it a go.It is terrible, right from the start with the ear-assaulting garbage music, to the incredibly frustrating and unintuitive menu and character selection screen that make you want to turn the thing off immediately.  Here is a little message for the developers: if your player selects some game mode (for me it was: tutorial) and wishes to exit that game mode, you should let them do that.  Typically this occurs by pressing ESC key to get to a menu.  In freestyle basketball you will not receive this courtesy, if you decide you want out, you are going to have to complete that tutorial.I somehow knew it was going to happen, but this was by far the worst gaming experience I have had in years.  There are plenty of decent free-to-play games out there.  This is not one of them.			"

												The art style, gameplay, graphics and sound are all fantastic. There is a lot of rubbish to endure if you wish to enjoy them though. Amazing potential ruined by clunky free 2 play interface, level up system and no joy pad support. I want this exact game but with a season mode, offline multiplayer, no level up system and a $15 price tag instead of the free2play sludge getting in the way. Would be great if they just made a game and nothing else. I'll pay in dollars.  "

												Nice game ... pay to win ?!  I have almost 1.000 hours in these game.I have just 2 max lvl characters ( lvl 50 ) and that cuz I play only with PG , I have a lvl 50 SG and PG the SG its a normal character , he was the first lvl 50 character i make. When i make my SG lvl 50 Freestyle2: Street Basketball give me a SPC cuppon ( Specia character , u can pay for it too , i make my PG).  When Ace of Wulin team appeared was an event with a rulette ( something like that ) and I was lucky and I get a SPC ( I got my sf cloud ).  On Freestyle2: Street Basketball 2nd anniversary I get a free SPC from Noble( gift for all players ( Ty Freestyle2: Street Basketball ♥) ) I make a C ( Center ).  And these week I make king of Steal ( title ) on my pg and I get 10 green basketballs to open , I go to open them and guess what ... I got other SPC and I make a SG cuz i wanted to buy a SPC sg but now i win it.  Why i keep playing Freestyle2: Street Basketball ???-Great Updates.-Every time events.-Bugs ? Press F9 ( if u are in FreeRoom ).-Replay value.  Bad thinks about Freestyle2: Street Basketball ???-If u want to be a good rebounder u need good PING.-If u want to start playing these game now its hard cuz good players everywhere.  Freestyle2: Street Basketball Its my favorite game I bought CS:GO but Freestyle2: Street Basketball its better in my opinion . So if u want to play these game i recommend you to do it , u have a lot of content and weekly Updates and NOT pay to win ... skill to win.I love FreeStyle and FreeStyle community ( and DBLL Don't judge me :D )   Main name YoALEXpg50 ( I'm just good not pro :) )  Sorry for my English I'm from romania.

												This game was nothing like I thought it was gonna be. I thought this game was gonna at least feel a little bit realistic. This game just feels awful to play. The character movements are clunky and the shooting is awful. Any character can shoot pretty much anywhere and the controls are horrible. I can literally shoot 3s with big centers.			"

												This is a fun game. At first I did not like the arrow keys controls, but I got used to them and they are fine. One problem I have with the game is that sometimes people with crappy connection will join your room, and then your whole team can't play any games. The 'evict people from your court' feature makes up for this though. It's a good game and I'll continue playing it			"

												Fun game, but not much ability to customize. You have to pay, and its heavily based on lootcrate systems like most things. You basically have 4 moves on offense and 4 moves on defense. Slow load times, and I don't like the lobby system. It appears there are only one game or 2 at a time. The game needs a lot of cleaning up that they probably won't do. Also steals don't seem quite on the money. It is fun though. Just has its flaws. I wish there was a better alternative.			"

												The pay to win system is flawless it gives a valid and meaning excuse to say you lost even though you're just bad, I also like it because I can't dunk in real life so it's like a cancer kid with a make a wish foundation, it allows me to dunk even though they stuff my♥♥♥♥♥♥back at me, such a fun and cool game, and probably still better than NBA2k even though it's free.

												It's a neat idea to make a basketball MMO, but you can't customize your character's looks and have to go with a default pre-made which is annoying; also the tutorial didn't see that I was using a gamepad and didn't switch to gamepad directions; finally (and worst of all), the controls are clunky and aimed at genre veterans instead of the average player. I can tell what I'm supposed to do, but I feel like I spend the whole game fighting the controls.			"

If you have a life or like me you detest P2W games, then avoid this like the plague.That said it is a fun game, too bad about the P2W choice. And yes I know it's 50% skill, 40% P2W & 10% luck but still it should be 75% skill & 25% luck.			"

												I'm just going to go straight into it. I've put in about 30 or so hours into this game and I have enjoyed my time spent with it for the most part.Freestyle 2 is a basketball game that is published by Joycity and hosted by Gamekiss. The game is run on a free 2 play model and while that may raise red flags for some, I've found it to be very fun and fair. After logging in, you are able to pick from a couple of classes. Small Forward, Point Forward, Center, Shot Guard, etc. After choosing a class, you are shown a list of different characters, that are really just chosen based on your preferred look or style. The game doesn't really offer any body customization like skin color, hair, eyes. But you can purchase different clothes, wigs, etc in the game shop. (They actually have a decent selection for the ingame free points that can be earned through playing.)~Gameplay~I've found the mechanics of this game to be enjoyable, they all work how I'd expect. The controls definately took some getting used to. It's been a long time since I've used my keyboads directional keys. The A button is to drive dribble, which consumes stamina and allows you to dash with the ball to pass your opponent.S is to pass or stealD is to shoot or blockW is to guard or post up. (Moving towards the basket with ball in a slower and more defensive motion.I've found that it's a little bit harder to play defense than offense, but it all works well and feels really good when you dunk on an oppenent and he/she is slammed back down. Your character(s) also have stats and level up. Level 50 is the max and the progression can be a bit slow after level 30. You put points into various attributes like 3 pt, layup, middle shot, speed, stamina, etc. The stats feel somewhat minor and it take's a bit to really notice a big difference. You can also buy skills and this opens up the game to a lot more, making it faster and way more interesting. One of the skills I received allows me to drive dribble back and forth to really shake up my opponents. I find the gameplay extremely enjoyable and for that alone, I can reccommend this game to just about anyone especcially if you have friends, but we will get to that.~Graphics~The game looks nice. It's a very simple cel shaded style and it runs pretty well on most low end computers that I've played on as well.  If you turn up the game to high/medium, you may notice the game having a blurry effect on the characters. I personally didn't like this effect and found the game to look better on low. You only have preset graphic selections of low, medium, and high, so I found no way to turn it off. Speaking of which, I should probably talk about the options menu a bit more.You cannot rebind your keys for drive dribble, pass, shoot, steal, or your movement. I found that to be a bit silly in a pc only game. Also no controller support, but they offer a guide on the site's forums that is stickied and it explains how to use a controller. This is still not a good thing in my opinion and hopefully they will add more options in the future, but I don't see it happening.~Sound~The music is different to say the least. It's like k pop mixed with rap. I personally liked it and at times found it hilarious, but after a while I got tired of hearing the same tracks over and over again and listened to some of my own music.~Community~Disclaimer: Another persons experience may differ from mine.So the community is pretty small, but you should not have an issue finding any games. Though, I must reccommend playing with friends. Usually in a small community, you would expect players to be a bit more tight-knit, but that is far from the case. There are a lot of people that say the trash talking is just apart of the game. I can agree some what with that, but that isn't where my problem with the community really comes from.You will experience more♥♥♥♥♥♥talking from fellow team mates. Players will berate you if you just get unlucky and miss a shot. You may see people go into all chat and call there own teammates noobs, because they are losing the game. (You lose nothing important by losing a game except your winrate and you still recieve the same exp and points for losing or winning.) Edit: I can understand someone not wanting to see their win ratio lowered. I've done quite a bit of competitive gaming and sometimes communities will judge based on your win ratio and not your actual skill. It's just the way of the world, unfortunately.I have to reccomend that you play this game with friends, because it is an extremely good time with people you know, win or lose. ~Cash shop pay to win or not?~I've played up to level 50 so far and have not experienced any real need to pay. Though there are things to pay for if you want to min max. There are cards that can be found with either luck or in a gachapon that boost your stats by a couple of points and then can be upgraded further. Some may want to find the best versions of those cards that upgrade the stats they want. There are also some cash only cosmetics to purchase, but no outfits have an expiration date and as I've said earlier, I was able to find a decent selection for points and they didn't take very long to buy. You can pay for extra skill slots and that seems to be the most pay 2 win aspect, but from what I've read, you can make a  good character without ever paying.There are also exp boosts and such for conveniece and I've found the model to be fair and I don't think there is anything wrong with the system.~Conclusion~I can definitely reccommend this game to just about anyone, especially if you have friends to play with. You will have an easier time with the community if you solo que at a lower level, but once you get into the higher leveled games, you will see a lot of hostility from your own teammates. Other wise, this is probably one of the best basketball games I've ever played. It runs well and does everything I'd expect from it.			"

												CoopHoops Lvl 50 SF Shrewd Type Crew: BruhGood game. Do not quit the game early because it will be a bit rough in the beginning as a rookie because you will be playing with other rookies who may or may not have experience with the game. You can play 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 in (Friendly Match Mode) but stats and records are only recorded on 3v3 (TeamMatches). To be successful in this game you have to find good teammates. One man armies are almost non-existent unless you are talking about me. :) Learn the basics of the game and try not to spam dribbles because that will just make you look like a fool when you end up on your back in the dirt. Tips: Ping is a big factor in the game but it is still playable. Also use gkash on skill slots, don't buy a bunch of item balls because 90% of the time you will get a point coupon or something that expires after 7 days. Other than that real good game when you have solid teammates. Good Luck and Have Fun!			"

												Very good game, freestyle 1 was better though, but this one brings in resolution options and more content. Wardrobes are limited but new clothes will be added as time goes on. This is a good c h i n k simulator if you want to play with them all the time because they are 2 short to play basketball IRL. Takes time to get good you need to know when to shoot, fake , rebound and positioning, etc. People who think this game is bad are idiots. Only bad thing is the ch1nks and the laggy players that come from the jungles of the Phillipines. Very good censorship in chat. saying ""idk"" or ""stupid"" gets censored but then theres players like ni gger666 that are allowed. Even saying the simple name of the game ""freestyle"" is censored in chatUPDATE: Chin ks still playing in NA server even though  a goo k server opened up this week. Very pay to win game. They spend their 5$ wekly factory paychecks to buy items on this game			"

												Uhmm Basketball thats free? YES PLEASE BABY YEA! This game is a smashing success. Love the easy mechanics and games no where close to a pay to win. My advise is when you get to pro league make a new character and so on so forth til you feel really confident in one playing class. Do not cry about losing all the time if you have no knowledge in basketball. You have to know what positions are good with what to get a general idea how to play.			"

												Fun, when you can actually play it. The game crashes frequently, lowest ping you can get on a server is 100ms, some people make the community not so great, no custom controls, cant play with friends and ball glitches while waiting for matches. Get rid of that and it would be a great game. But right now its just rage inducing			"

												Freestyle2: Street Basketball   I like it.      I will admit I dont think I am very good at it at this time, but I enjoy what I have played.    Now that by no means its good to go, I feel its got some big kinks that need banged out before it gets popular.  Overall I enjoyed the gameplay, but A few things keep me from loving the game.- Ping, I had good ping most of the time, but if someone one your team is not running the game at 100 percent you are in for a bad time!- Cash shop I feel needs some work.  you should never get an actual gameplay advantage over other players from a cash shop purchase, that everyone else cant get with grind.- Bugs, I havent seen this mentioned by anyone else yet but I have encountered many.  the three best ones I have seen are the basketball hitting the ground so hard it shoots into the sky, after it was up there it got notmal physics again though so after like 10 bounces it started to get to a normal level again so someone could catch it.   Then there was the time one of the AI players got his legs stuck in the ground and could not move the rest of the match. or better yet the time the AI got the ball and ran into a corner and just started spazzing out, over and over again.  Fun times.    - Menues can be hard to  maneuver some times, I dont know if its a bug or im just not getting it but I always end up on the wrong ""page""There are a good deal of positives though! These include,- There is adiquate character customization- The gameplay seems sound, I jsut wish there was controller support ( I feel this game could use it)- overall art style is pretty neat, not your average anime-esqueReally though I dont see anything that cant be fixed with a little time and patience.  there is a good base to work from and I like the art style a good deal, I just hope they make the changes the community want.  Another small note that doesn't fall in the plus or minus spectrum is that the community has a pretty good deal of all around A-holes.  The kind of player you usually only see in mobas! so be warned. Otherwise if it still sounds interesting after all that give it a try!			"

												FreeStyle Street BasketBallyak sebelum masuk ke cerita inti..gue AFK588KatieNishimuraG2A a.k.a Thanrie Boniaga mau cerita dulu tentang game ini.. game ini adalah game basket jalanan, ngga seperti game basket biasa yang formal dan kaku, game ini memiliki berbagai Freestyle dan skills yang cukup beragam dan keren. Di Freestyle Street BasketBall kita dapat bertanding dalam mode 1 on 1, 2 on 2, dan 3 on 3.. sebenernya ada juga 5 on 5 tapi sayangnya mode 5 on 5 belum di implementasikan hingga sekarang, moga aja secepatnya di implementasikan biar makin seru haha.Dalam game ini salah satu yang dibutuhkan adalah kekompakan dari para anggota team tersebut. Karena dalam permainan basket, mau itu basket real ataupun hanya dalam game tetap dibutuh♥♥♥♥♥♥ja sama team yang sangat baik. Tanpa kerja sama yang baik pasti bakal sulit untuk membuat point, jadi dalam game ini tiap personal harus bisa menahan ego masing masing. Kalo gabisa maen kompak ya mending maen 1 on 1 aja hahaha :DMenurut gue game ini sangat asik untuk mencari teman dengan adanya fitur Club, disini kita bisa bergabung dengan club sesuai dengan yang kita inginkan. Biasanya ketua club membuat group di facebook sehingga para players dapat saling mengenal satu sama lain dan juga bisa saling sharing ilmu sehingga dapat menambah kekompakan dan juga skill para players.Game ini sekitar bulan Maret awal sempat mengalami beberapa masalah dan kendala akibat update yang mungkin banyak tidak disetujui oleh para pemain lama yang sudah mencapai title MVP. Soalnya sebelum update bulan Maret di Major ada 3 title, yaitu Liga Utama (level 16-30), All Stars (level 31-41), dan MVP (level 42-45) kemudian pada update Maret title AS (All Stars) ditiadakan dan diubah menjadi MVP (MVP jadi level 31-45). Banyak para pemain yang udah nyampe level 42 keatas yg protes tetapi GM pun segera bertindak dan dalam beberapa bulan GM melakukan update yang cukup membuat para pemain excited kembali yaitu open square,fame level, dan club battle. Inilah update update yang membuat para pemain Freestyle kembali merasakan tantangan baru dan peminatnya pun makin bertambah. Dilihat dari sini, pada beberapa bulan ke depan pasti game ini bakal jadi lebih baik lagi :DDalam Freestyle Street Basketball terdapat 3 posisi, yaitu Center (C), Forward (F), dan Guard (G). Setelah memasuki level 15, untuk posisi Forward dan Guard dapat memilih posisi yang lebih spesifikasi dan sesuai dengan yang diinginkan oleh para player. Untuk Forward dapat memilih untuk menjadi Power Forward (PF) atau dapat juga menjadi Small Forward (SF). Lalu untuk Guard dapat memilih untuk menjadi Point Guard (PG) ataupun menjadi Shooting Guard (SG). Tiap posisi memiliki kelebihan dan kekurangan masing masing			"

Posted: May 8, 2015
												A few things about this game.Pros:Can be funNice stat trackerCons:There is a special character that is named Big Joe or some♥♥♥♥♥♥like that. Big black PF. His hitbox is GINORMOUS. As in, it's impossible to block his dunks. Like, literally impossible. It's an extremely ♥♥♥♥ing OP character. If you have one of these guys in your game, he's automatically going to win MVP of the game and you WILL lose if he's not on your team.The PF position is way overpowered. Even aside from Big Joe. The PF position is stronger than every other position by a huge amount. They'll almost always dunk over a Center. This game assumes that every single PF in the entire ♥♥♥♥ing world is LeBron James, which just isn't the case.If you're a C or a PF or a SF, you'll never hit 3s no matter how open you are. I understand that those position aren't usually used for 3s anyway, but you know how to make it so it's actually fair? When you shoot, there's an accuracy bar as in every basketball game really. You have to get the slider into the green position to get a good shot. On these positions, there isn't a green section. Make there be a green section, but make as tiny as my♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ There's no reason for the game to say, ""Hey, you're not supposed to be taking those kinds of shots, so you're just gonna automatically miss it.""When you get a ""perfect shot"" after hitting the green on the slider (hit the green, nobody guarding you, full shot quality), it'll almost certainly miss. Either take out the little ""PERFECT SHOT!"" graphic or actually make it hit. The game has Pay2Win features. You CAN win without paying, but people who pay money for cards are just bound to have better stats.There's a Skill called box out that can be placed on PF and C. If you don't know what boxing out is, it's basically guarding the basket to get a rebound. This skill needs a big tweek job in the game. If you even touch somebody while they're boxing out, your character will get stuck for like a second as they back up. It's enough to have the space to get a rebound against somebody, but making that person freeze for a second just for bumping into them is stupid as ♥♥♥♥. Anybody who has the box out skill is always going to get the rebound.The swear filter in this game is the absolute WORST I've ever seen. It's bad enough that the developers think they're our parents by having us not swear, but to censor things like ""pass, idk, etc."" is stupid. Just get rid of the swear filter altogether or make is optional. It's not that ♥♥♥♥ing hard to do. The announcer in the game SAYS words that are filtered in chat. This is a team game. Maybe have the ability to use the mic or something. Communicating with the team is a horrible pain because of the swear filter.The menu on the game is terrible too. You have to learn how to use it and where things are located by doing it. The game gives no explanation about cards, freestyles, skills, etc. When applying attributes to your character, the developers need to have it to where when scrolling over the name of the attribute, it gives an explanation about what that attribute actually does. You recommend that the PF puts there attribute points on ""Tussle?"" What the ♥♥♥♥ is ""tussle?"" Why should I put my points on it? What's it do?Most of the time, pressing ready with your team and going to the matchup screen will work. I'd say like 60% of the time it'll work. The other 40% of the time, you're gonna get stuck at 30%, which will take you back to the practice room with your team. That's a problem. If this happens to you, you won't be able to start a match again until the readied players unready and ready back up.Some problems with the community: Why the ♥♥♥♥ even press the ""ready"" button if you're just gonna go AFK as soon as the ♥♥♥♥ing game starts? You serious? Way too many people do this. If you're not ready, don't press the ""ready"" button. It's not hard. Some people lag badly when they have the ball. I'm pretty sure this is intentional. You'll be defending someone and it'll look like they're running to the sidelines, but when they catch up, they're on the other side of the court behind the 3 line with nobody on them. Easy 3... unless you're a C, PF, or SF, but I won't rant about that again.You'll get into games with people who will shoot the ball no matter what. They never look for the open man. They'd rather get blocked or miss it by 289371 feet if it meant making 1 out of 10 shots they put up. The problems that made me uninstall the game were the Big Joe character and the broken box out skill. I don't recommend anyone play the game until they fix a lot and get rid of the swear filter. You know, so you can actually talk to your teammates in a team game. "

After muting the extremely obnoxious background music, I tried to make a lobby for my friends so we could mess around. Thats when we get in to the, frankly, terrible hud. Lots of pop ups about ""gifts"" and tutorials. Even with all that, I couldn't get a lobby in which I had control over who joined. The last thing I have to say about this game is the graphics.

												Yang bilang gak tahan main game ini pada saat mencapai lv 24 ( Pro Channel ). saran gw cari temen yang bisa di ajak main 1 tim, yang mau di ajak kerjasama dan bisa saling mengerti satu sama lain. memang banyak player yang bacotnya gak nahan yang suka menghina player baru... tapi banyak juga player yang normal punya etika dan bisa di ajak kerjasama.  karena saya pribadi mengalami yang namanya di bully, di kick, di bilang noob, cacat, sampah, di suruh delete char lah. tapi dikarenakan saya punya banyak teman (di game) dan mau belajar dari cara melihat mereka bermain saya jadi tidak terlalu memperdulikan orang-orang yang gak berpendidikan yang cepet emosian *terutama bocah* yang taunya cuma mau menang dan yang bego di kick!.... So.....Saran saja cukup kamu cari orang yang cocok dengan kamu dan bisa di ajak bermain bersama tanpa memperdulikan kemampuan player masing"" ( biasanya teman seperjuangan adalah tim terbaik ). TyFor people who not enjoyed the game when it reaches lv 24 (Pro Channel). My advice look for a friend who could be invited to play as 1 team, who would get the cooperation and can understand each other. Thats my Advice!. indeed many players his word is outrageous and insulting the new player ... but there are many players who normally have ethics and could get the cooperation. because I have personally been in bully people, get kicked, say noob, defects, trash, want me remove my char. but because I have many friends (in the game) and want to learn from the way to see them play, so I was not too concerned with people who are not educated are speedy emotions (especially young children) who just want to win and dumb kicked! .. .. So .....Advice from me is you find someone who fits with you and be invited to play together regardless of their abilities player ""(usually comrade in arms is the best team). Thankyou.			"

Stiff, un-characteristic player models like they have spinal problems and cant lean over. Online I beat the first game without even trying just by standing in front of the other players team mates making him unable to pass the ball before the clock. Lack of imagination when it comes to moves. The graphics are like Jet Set Radio or S4 league			"

												If you can see, yes I have played 64 hours, but ... I LOSED 64 HOURS OF MY LIFE ON THIS GAME.Yeah, rage review.SG=WinShooting Guards are too OP [Over Powered], because they have 100% 3pt shot... . PG is only from recovering balls and stealing them and in real basketball Point guard is from awesome playmaking and shooting. SF only have 2pt shots, ONLY. Nothing more. Center VS PF ... C>PF. PF in the character creation was doing a dunk, but ITS TOO EASY TO BLOCK BY CENTER. Center have easier dunks then PF. Just destroying every character with his weight ;v. PF is useless (Yeah, I had PF at 24 lv and its useless). Just buy by real money an extra character - Gorilla = instablock + instarebound.Why I giving a ""NO"" to this game? Because Pay2Win <3!Makers of the game likes money, everyone likes money but not on this scale!I was playing a match ...2 monkeys and one SG. It was Instant Rebound (2,10m and my character was something about 1,90m) and instant pass to SG. You was doing a dunk or shoot ... INSTA BLOCK OUTTANOWHERE. Gorillas plox.SG if he have items bought from IS = Insta win. 100% chance to 3pt, easy.Don't lose your time on this game guys, just buy NBA 2K16 on CONSOLE (Please, don't waste your money on PC version. Look at my NBA 2K16 review)Big NO from me :)			"

												If you are looking for a free to play game, this is not the game for you. This game's cash shop offers stat buff equips and stat upgraded characters (purchasable avatars) so be prepared to dish out some dough if you are planning to play this competitively. So far the gameplay is a bit flimsy and feels unbalanced because the offensive capabilities of the players feels overpowering versus the defensive stats (the offense feels slimy and always gets through the defense). It is fun to play with friends and having played the original Freestyle way back, some of the mechanics are still in tact. All in all I was happy to try this game and re-live some FSSB nostalgia but this game is just not for me to play in the long run.			"

												I'm going to continually edit this review as I keep playing the game, so my thoughts may change over time/be incomplete.After my first match:This game is actually pretty damn fun. It surprised me really. I went into it with a semi-closed mind, but came out really enjoying my first game. Looking forward to playing more.After my second match:I lost the game by three points, damn. That was, again, really fun. I'm getting genuinely hyped over this and I'm really enjoying it. I'm getting slightly better at defense and shot/block timing, but I'm still pretty shoddy.After my first online match with a friend:Me and my friend decided to play the game together, so we hopped into an online game. We got totally obliterated. Practice makes perfect I guess.			"

												Edited Review:After 1 year i just came back to see how's this game now.So far in my 1 hour gaming seems good, of course noobs are everywhere.Pros:•If you love sports specially basketball •Trample enemies on floor•Love to block bo*bs of female players•Good Music Fx•Good Graphics•Too many costumes (FREE if you keep on playing and lucky on draws)•I'm in ASIA server so community/players count is good.•Trashtalk all you can as long as you win (soooooo bad)•Donate cost too much so overpowered stats are very few.Cons:•Game Anti Cheat Program sometimes detect something even i dont have any software running.•Items cannot be traded :(•Not to mention you will encounter some cancerous players here•Donate cost too high for premium character but its ok, since they have OP stats.(only few though)-Overall its all about players view point if this game is good/bad. For me its fine, playable, good time killer, recreational. In short i'm having fun.			"

												According to all known lawsof aviation, there is no way a beeshould be able to fly. Its wings are too small to getits fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't carewhat humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow!Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry?- Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening?- I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your fatherpaid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate.We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz.- Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.- Bye! Barry, I told you,stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam.- Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel?- A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school,three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I tooka day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry.- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie?- Yeah. - You going to the funeral?- No, I'm not going. Everybody knows,sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel.Such a hothead. I guess he could havejust gotten out of the way. I love this incorporatingan amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp...under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men.- We are! - Bee-men.- Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oitygraduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your careerat Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennasinside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like?- A little scary. Welcome to Honex,a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee,have worked your whole life to get to the point where youcan work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant PollenJocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected,scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctivegolden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot.- She's my cousin! - She is?- Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right.- At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspectof bee existence. These bees are stress-testinga new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes?- Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement,the Krelman. - What does that do?- Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs aresmall ones. But bees know that every small job,if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the jobyou pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life?I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees,as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?""How can you say that? One job forever?That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only haveto make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could theynever have told us that? Why would you question anything?We're bees. We're the most perfectlyfunctioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe thingswork a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you knowwhat I'm talking about. Please clear the gate.Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!- Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's likeoutside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks!- Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters!You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were.- I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knowswhere, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a PollenJock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollenthan you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol.Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing itand the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies?Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys.- Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerousbeing a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned meagainst a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat,and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my!- I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today,wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patchsix miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh?- Barry! A puddle jump for us,but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am.- You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy?Are you bee enough? I might be. It all dependson what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices.- But you only get one. Do you ever get boreddoing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you justmove it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm.It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad,the more I think about it, maybe the honey fieldjust isn't right for me. You were thinking of what,making balloon animals? That's a bad jobfor a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not surehe wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes.- I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're goinginto honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer?- No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now.I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Geta gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today!- Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobswill be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available?- Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations!Step to the side. - What'd you get?- Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first?- No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open,not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman?- Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See?He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up.Dead from the neck down. That's life!  (ง´• ͜つ •`)ง			"

												What a ridiculous game, at first it seemed fun, however...instructions were extremely vague on ""skills"" and there is really no point to the game because I could shoot what they called a ""perfect shot"" at the three every single time I threw it up but it will never go in? Whats the point? The game just randomly decides who is going to make all the shots and who isn't. I put every single attribute point into three point shot skill as I leveled up and I took maybe 25 three point shots a game and almost every single shot was ""perfect"" yet I probably made 3/25? what is this garbage? Horrible game mechanics, not to mention the extremely confusing layout of the whole game and the glitchiness of gameplay. 2/10			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												Do not I repeat DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. This game is practically a virus I barely managed to remove this game from my PC. You have been warned. Good luck.There seem to be many positive reviews for this game even though it is a F2P title all the rave reviews for it are from people who have played less than 30 minutes of the game itself. I think the people who are actually upvoting and reviewing this game positively must be hacked steam accounts.If you check the amount of Thumbs-Up/Thumbs-Down/Funny hits on each of the positive/negative reviews they do not add up.Shady company with a questionable game client.

												The first few games I've played my teammates almost never gave me the ball even though I played as a PG (the playmaker). Everyone was just shooting (and almost all the time missing) 3 Pointers, even the Center. This is completely stupid since basketball is about teamwork. The game itself is good though. Gameplay is fun and the graphics are ok.			"

												The game looks kind of fun, but when you actually start playing, you won't think anything is fair. The game is very harsh on beginners. The community ignores new people looking for help (I posted on forums several times asking different questions and was ignored) and the game makes winning matches impossible even with the beginner section of levels 1-11. Computers can be extremely easy but as soon as you play an online match, somehow the person's stats as well as all of his computer's stats are boosted so much higher than you, that his computer makes every 3pt attempt it goes for, and your computer misses every single shot it takes. Seriously the blocking system is so difficult that it really feels like luck to get any blocks. Don't even get me started on blocking dunks. The game has no tutorial on blocking dunks, and since the community doesn't care for new people, nobody was able to help me learn. Aside from the game being difficult, I can't even figure out most of the menus and i've played for a few days. I have no idea how to make my stats higher other than the 2 points from leveling up, yet they hint at the idea that purchased clothing can boost your stats. However you're supposed to do that, i haven't figured out. There's a lot of things i could complain about, but it isn't worth it since I can't see myself trying to practice this game. I feel like i've already peaked in my skill level, and everything is about who has the highest stats.			"

												The biggest downside to the game, as you've probably seen, is the community. I'm willing to bet if the community was cleaned up, there would be much more positive reviews, but that frankly won't happen. So, the community is horrid.The community is fine with mocking other players, should they be watching them on the featured match thing, or playing with them. The amount of bragging and downtalking is unreal. If there was a feature to turn the chat off, it would be a blessing.Moving off the community, the game itself isn't bad. The game mechanics are rather solid, and the music (which isn't too bad, but can get old) can be turned off. Regarding the music, there supposedly is a surplus of songs, but for some reason only three will play in a loop, even when all of them are checked. You're given enough room to make your character look decent by paying with in-game or real-life currency. That said, the voices for the characters are near the bottom of the barrel. Seeing as each gender only has three voices, and each are decent at best, and pretty bad, at the worst.Shooting and defending are close to the same difficulty. Shooting can be kinda odd, seeing as the bar will sometimes mean literally nothing (you can for some reason still make a shot, if it's outside the green/yellow, and miss when it's in the green), or everything. Defending is equally weird, in that while it's done decently, it's not the easiest thing in the world to do, without a good deal of practice (like anything).Finally, the servers themselves can be sketchy. You may join a room, and have everybody ready up. You might find another team to play, only for the game to stop the loading at thirty percent and send both teams back to their ""lobby"". There is no reason I've seen for this, besides the game being kinda weird. That said, it'll normally go away, after some time.For the most part, the game is fine for what it is. The biggest drawback is the community, so if you're able to ignore the community, you'll probably enjoy the game itself.			"

												Am new to steam and was looking for a basketball game to hold me over until the new 2k comes out. Found this game and enjoyed playing it for the most part. Alot of character customization through either levelling up or different equipment. My main complaint with this game is that the majority of people on it seem to have no idea how the game of basketball is played. 3on3 usually dissolves into whoever spawned as the ball handler juking toward the basket for a dunk. No clear perks to any position, atleast not enough to make them stand apart. Overall a decent game, with alittle choppy gameplay.			"

												TL;DR : Paying gives slight advantages which will increase probabilities of things like shots, stealing, blocking, speed, etc. but ultimately skill overrides all of this.  I have paid nothing, and still whoop players who have spent cash on this game.  There's a lot of trash-talking, but show me a competitive game without that.  If arcade style hoops is your thing, this game is really fun, and the price is right.Do you remember NBA Jam. or more recently the NBA Street series? This is an online, 3v3 version of those games.  There are no rules, no fouls, but it's so much fun and an enjoyable arcade style basketball game.  Just to address a few issues though:Some games have had lag spikes that are annoying, but most of the time fix themselves within 10 seconds or so.  Other times, there are glitches such as the ball being unable to be picked up, passed, shot, in which case you will be waiting for the game clock to expire, and whoever had the highest score before the glitch will win.Is this game pay-to-win?  Somewhat, but not really.  There are a lot of little stat boosts you can buy with money, but most of them can be earned by playing the game and earning in-game currency as well.  There are ""special"" characters which start with additional stat boosts, but you can also earn one of these for free by reaching level 50 with any character.  Ultimately, do people who cash have a slight advantage?  Definitely.  But no amount of cash can make you a good player, or let you win all the time.  This game still relies heavily on skill, predicting your opponent, and your general ability to play good offense and defense.			"

For ♥♥♥♥ sake I spent about 1000 dollars in that game.....Anyway Freestyle 2 some what fixed the heavy P2W by making people able to buy stats without spending money but there is still some difference with point stats and Pay stats...(Points +5, Cash +7 or +9) Also not many people know that this game depends alot on ur internet connection why? becuase if you have good internet you will be able to jump right away or faster than the other person, people with slow/laggy internet will have delay when they press jump :/anyway love the improvement and would recommend to people with good internet :P			"

												For my hours on the game i've come to not like this.here are a few of my reasons...Im a C SPC.I've spent 25 on this.1) with my ping of 70, i still loose a lot in reb due to speedhacks, and 40ping people.2) C can shoot three pretty well, if you comepletely build him that way, and he face shots unbelieveable good if build taht way. im number 3 in C 3pters.... BUT, you can miss a full 100% wide open layup...3) Pf's don't have backblock, but thier manual block does taht for em.4) events are nice, but ultimately most of em is to spend money.5) 20 bucks for a SPC is stupid, because another 20 is spent on unlocking all skills and 20 more on good clothes, so to have best character is it 60 bucks, and that doesnt include RARE pro cards...6) NBA15 2K, is way more fun. Trust me, from how toxic chat is, from how ping relied this game is, from how stupid some people are, and from how most people who play this are kids. It is way more fun to play with a bunch of black guys on NBA, then wiggers in this.7) The grind is a super long road, i've  played for almost 5 months, and im still not level 50... WTF8) SPC gets starting extra 40 skill points... so they could boost one stat to like +15 at start...9) Your ♥♥♥♥ed quite a bit in any balls, (used 15 card balls, 13 of em was 1000 points....)10) Ping, i can't strees it enough, only people that can play without good ping, is mainly SG... (slide to the three man)11) Koreans find glitch, becomes well known... Never patched, allows travel with ball.12) im tired of all this♥♥♥♥♥♥. here is some good points.+13) DOES NOT HAVE GOOD CUSTOMIZATION (you can do clothes... tahts bout it... wow1) Teamwork2) Control one character3) Sasisfying wins (misspelled that so bad)4) Almost all clans are♥♥♥♥♥♥ even top ones. (wait... that's bad right?)5) So Many Events6) Provides cool stats7) Pretty UI (complicated a bit though)8) Orginally korean, and the just texture over it and sound over it so you can play, YAY!Ultimately, i say try it for about a month. you'll get tired, and quit... Near level 35, the games gets so unrealistic. people travel, fly across court, and dunk from freethrow... Best levels for simple fun? That's 5-10. 10-20 gets more complicated and 20-30 get hard, and 30-50 is ♥♥♥♥ing god mode for some people... You will see people with FULL just realeased gear, because (an event right now is any money you spend you get back with 10x the amount , so you spend 10 bucks, they credit you 100... so good luck).... Sadly, im addicted to it.			"

												This game is soooo close to being an amazing game. It has everything you want in a F2P game: good gameplay, good graphics, a fairly decent community, and regular updates and changing events to keep you coming back.  However, it also has P2W microtransactions, the one thing that makes so many of these F2P so unappealing to people.When you start the game, you can create a character in any of the 5 positions in basketball.  You'll also notice that there are tabs, each one signifying the different types of players.  The most basic is just named with the same name of the game.  The other tabs have various ""Special Characters"" that you can buy for $15 if you don't have a coupon to make it free.  If you are new, you may not notice much different with these ""Special Characters"" except for a different skin.  However, these ""Special Characters"" gain a +40 stat boost that you can use at will when you purchase them.To put this in perspective, you gain +2 stat points every time you level up.  That means that if you pay $15, you can basically gain 20 levels worth of stats.  The max level cap is 50.  No matter how long you play, a basic character can never be as good as a paid character because of this, especially since this game's mechanics relies upon stat advantages and you can only be on specific servers for about 10 levels.  Even if you are a normal character at the top range of levels for your server, you will still be worse than a special character just getting into a server.You can be in a great position to block a dunk, but if you have a lower Tussle stat than the other character then you will be ran over.  The higher Long Dunk stat you have the longer range you can dunk from and the higher (vertically) your dunk is.  Needless to say this means Special Characters can end up dunking from the top of the key from a standstill, something that I have yet to see in real basketball.  The greater Middle and 3 pt. shot stat you have means that you'll have a greater chance of making the shot even with ""Active Defense"", the greatest defense you can have on a shot other than a straight up block.  This means that you can be all over your mark, but unless you can get a block you may as well not even be covering your man.  The game even breaks at a certain point when the stats get high enough.  The tutorial makes it clear that you can't block or steal from behind a player, yet I've seen so many ""Special Characters"" do that exact thing simply because their Steal or Block stat is noticably high.This isn't even taking into account the paid stat boosts you can get from clothing, the more stat-awarding ""toys"" you can buy with real money, and having the ability to get more stat-improving cards with real money.  Even the VIP system is broken, giving them extra skill slots, an XP boost, the ability to kick ANYONE from servers (including the host), and other minor tweaks.  Yes, you get a 50% XP boost for paying real cash for a VIP upgrade, giving those with money an even greater advantage.This is why F2P games fail.  You won't notice this at the lower levels, and you'll have some fun times, but when you get to the higher levels there are less and less basic characters, only leaving the specials to destroy the court.Regardless, if you can look past this, I recommend this game to anyone who likes basketball or wants to get into it.  To anyone looking for competetive play based entirely on skill though, I strongly urge you to look at other games and only play this for the arcade feel.			"

												Just a bad game. Feels way too slow and clunky for a basketball game. The players walk in quicksand basically. The community is also terrible, and many idiots feel the need to be your basketball coach despite being ballhogs who don't actually know how basketball works.Just download it and try it, you'll see what I mean. I would reccommend shelling out the cash for NBA 2k17 and playing mypark if you can. It's 1000x better.			"

												I'll be 100% honest here.I started playing during FSSB 1 when it was owned by Sierra Online. I mained PF until the servers went offline. From there I waited until the GameKiss version came out. I remade my PF, but over the course of FSSB 1 I played every position to atleast lv 30, eventually maining C. Then the 2nd FSSB was released through gamekiss.. At first it wasn't what I enjoyed coming from the older versions, but I did still enjoy it as it was new. I've played FSSB on and off since 2008, and I have since decided that FSSB 2 is tons better. Sure PF is overpowered compared to the C position, but thats about the only disadvantage in the whole game. I feel that it is fair, and since it has been on steam, the ping issuses have mainly been dealt with as long as you play during the day with NA. I love this game and have always told my friends to play it. C:			"

												Pros:- easy to get into with a bit of basketball knowledge- first hours are really fun- if you get good teamplayers and go on a winning streak, it is really fun but..Cons:- ..but that nearly never happens, toxic community, lot of ego players, who only spam ""pass me the ball"" and never pass back and insult you anyway- the game supports this ego style because being open isnt as important as individual skill and outplaying your direct opponent- simple but sometimes weird acting controls (buttons have 2-3 different functions, dunk and postgame for example), different results in same spots and blocks and rebounds seem a lot like coin flips most of time, or i didn't play long enough to understand the mechanics.- lags are a huge issue, a lot of players warp around the court and score or rebound or get lose balls without the game even showing anything. it just happens.- terrible UI, lots of bugs, long loading times, the game hides a lot of information for example skills and stats of other players, which i guess is intended because..- .. massive P2W, you can buy toys, cards, skills, freestyles and clothing with bonus stats- no real matchmaking, you could get a team of 3 Cs who just afk or a perfect P2W team with a 5 game winning streak, both games are going to be no fun at all.Summary:It really has a lot of potential and could be fun, but the issues and the community are just to bad to keep playing it for longer.

It has a really good mix of arcade and sports games that I've only seen in NBA Jam. The game uses all the positions correctly and the only true way to win is by using teamwork. I would definitly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RPG's or sports if they can see past the sometimes crappy fanbase.			"

												The game looks kind of fun, but when you actually start playing, you won't think anything is fair. The game is very harsh on beginners. The community ignores new people looking for help (I posted on forums several times asking different questions and was ignored) and the game makes winning matches impossible even with the beginner section of levels 1-11. Computers can be extremely easy but as soon as you play an online match, somehow the person's stats as well as all of his computer's stats are boosted so much higher than you, that his computer makes every 3pt attempt it goes for, and your computer misses every single shot it takes. Seriously the blocking system is so difficult that it really feels like luck to get any blocks. Don't even get me started on blocking dunks. The game has no tutorial on blocking dunks, and since the community doesn't care for new people, nobody was able to help me learn. Aside from the game being difficult, I can't even figure out most of the menus and i've played for a few days. I have no idea how to make my stats higher other than the 2 points from leveling up, yet they hint at the idea that purchased clothing can boost your stats. However you're supposed to do that, i haven't figured out. There's a lot of things i could complain about, but it isn't worth it since I can't see myself trying to practice this game. I feel like i've already peaked in my skill level, and everything is about who has the highest stats.			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.Eat.			"

												This game is continues to be garbage. I was looking forward to seeing how the game improved, but unfortunately the game has become more toxic. Players continuously calling for you to pass the ball, but never pass the ball in return nor does diefense. When a player is unable to get open, they often just launch the ball instead of passing it. Players are even shooting contested shots. What's even more troll are the centers who don't even try to jump for the ball. What is the point of this game if you are being forced to play with selfish players?			"

												This is a great game for anyone who enjoys basketball, or a challenge. However, pay to win can sometimes be frustrating. Once you get past all the pay to win players, this is a very good free to play basketball game. There's people who play on the servers everyday so you can find a match 99% percent of the time. Most people who have down rated this game are people who haven't put enough time or practice to get the hang of the game. I have spent a total of 5 dollars on this game, and I don't even use the character I put the money towards. With that being said, yes this game is somewhat pay to win, but with enough practice, and a well formed team you can give any team a run for their money. 8/10 needs some balancing in the pay 2 win aspect, bug other than that this is a great F2P game.

												Menu is buggy, I selected very expensive (10k) Pants - Made then white to match my gloves and tail and got them.It didnt ask me to equip them like it normally does and when i went into my invintory they were orange and black - which looks nothing like tiger stripe. I also had to play through the tutorial but not when i started the game - only after i got put into major at level 4 - than consistantly placed with people who dont understand the controls (This is a kids game or atleast is populated by them, leaving older players alienated or happy if they dont like typing) No matter what you do to the settings it will always load in a bordered window forced fullscreen on some 600x800(i honestly forget the real resolution)♥♥♥♥♥♥- thank goodness this game has a great artstyle but unfortunantly you wont notice a difference between High and Medium textures besides tanning. The gameplay isnt very inovative as far as videogames go - Your charicter will either be slow, easy to steal from and great at dunking, Fast, unable to dunk, great at passing, or one of those kids who spams the a button trying to juke you out but there really just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and cant comprehend that maby people can think.The name of the game is being tall and fast. You dont need steal - as someone who uses steal alot this 100% depends on your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ team (its not if its when)If hes just gunna sit there trying to make 3s all day then nothings gunna happen but if your team is close to you guarding someone else one of you can run up and swat while the other defends.Rebounding is next3 point is nextthe colision is♥♥♥♥♥♥you can drag people away by moving into them, even with low tussle you can jump into someone or walk into someone jumping and then moved.

												Let me start out by saying, this game has TONS if potential. The controlls are simple and easy to use, the gameplay reminds me of the old NBA Street  games , and there are a lot of cutimazation options for your character. So, where does the game fall short?The community is trash. Most of the people on this game hate playing team ball, and make 2k ballhogs look like Magic freaking Johnson. Me and my brother Played about 20 games, i would asy MAYBE 3 of those where with a competent teamate. I know what you are thinking though, why not just find a good 3rd person. Well we would but, the party system, (or lack of a party system) is just god awful and makes joining games a pain in the buttocks. Also the game itself is fairly frustrating, as there is little to no skill involed in the game. People will run left, right, left, and launch a 3. 90% of the time it goes.And i alos dont like the fact that blocking and rebounding are basically random.The game could be really good. If they would make a legit party system, most of my problems with the game would vanish. OVERALL 5/10			"

												I've been playing Freestyle2 for a few weeks now and its a great f2p game. There are many very attainable items, lots of skill sets, and a very cool positioning system. The gameplay is strategic compared to your typical sports game, making this game unique.  I usually put at least an hour a day into playing. There is a lot of content for a f2p game. The game can be a bit grindy, but it never feels as exhuasting as many other f2p games out there.The only bummer is the online in-game comunitee. For what seems like a relatively small population, the game is absolutley riddled with elitist, poor sports, and very immature gamers. It is a huge relief when you find a lobby with laid back players. I have no idea why this game glows particularly with nastiness, but it's interesting nonetheless.That aside, I still really enjoy this game, and it hasn't yet stopped me from playing it. I do recommend Freestyle2: Street Basketball for gamers looking for a great f2p game on Steam.			"

												TL;DR : Paying gives slight advantages which will increase probabilities of things like shots, stealing, blocking, speed, etc. but ultimately skill overrides all of this.  I have paid nothing, and still whoop players who have spent cash on this game.  There's a lot of trash-talking, but show me a competitive game without that.  If arcade style hoops is your thing, this game is really fun, and the price is right.Do you remember NBA Jam. or more recently the NBA Street series? This is an online, 3v3 version of those games.  There are no rules, no fouls, but it's so much fun and an enjoyable arcade style basketball game.  Just to address a few issues though:Some games have had lag spikes that are annoying, but most of the time fix themselves within 10 seconds or so.  Other times, there are glitches such as the ball being unable to be picked up, passed, shot, in which case you will be waiting for the game clock to expire, and whoever had the highest score before the glitch will win.Is this game pay-to-win?  Somewhat, but not really.  There are a lot of little stat boosts you can buy with money, but most of them can be earned by playing the game and earning in-game currency as well.  There are ""special"" characters which start with additional stat boosts, but you can also earn one of these for free by reaching level 50 with any character.  Ultimately, do people who cash have a slight advantage?  Definitely.  But no amount of cash can make you a good player, or let you win all the time.  This game still relies heavily on skill, predicting your opponent, and your general ability to play good offense and defense.			"

												The game is fun to play. It has...or had great potential to be a great animated basketball game. It makes you feel great when you can shoot almost consecutive 3pt or 2pt shots throughout a whole game, which could also be a problem when other players can do it too. The attribution distribution almost has no value anymore. I had a sg with all points given to her 3pt attribute (to be able to make 3pt shots) at level 20 and STILL have a low chance of making a 3pt shot even when the gauge is matched and I'm not marked. However, a pf is somehow able to make open 3pt shots more than a sg...makes so much sense. Also, tell me how can a sf be able to catch more rebounds than a center and pf combined??The game is pay-to-win. There are special characters with higher distributed attributes than the normal characters (very unfair) and the special characters also start off with better cards (which further increases their attributes). I know this since I had the chance to get a free special character during an event. So don't get mad when you match up against people with special characters and see that they're making 3pt shots in your face the whole game and not missing (*cough* SG...and PF... *cough*).The game community is extremely toxic. Everyone makes you out to be an amateur (noob) for not being able block EVERY shot from your special 3pt making opponent or not being able to catch a rebound over a tall paid-to-win sasquatch (not literally, but they're pretty big and one of the characters literally looks like a beast). It's either you start off as a pro in this game or face the consequences of being shunned for noobism. I don't know why entirely, but the server I play in lags every so often even when I have high speed internet connectivity. I assume other players from around the world join the server (e.g. Players from the Asian server joining the N.American server) and it creates crazy lag. It is irritating enough to go against a pay-to-win sg making 3's. Now you're going against one that knows how to teleport all over the court. The lag can get so intense, you would think you're watching DBZ - Basketball Edition.Anyway, I really did enjoy playing this game during the first few levels, but as you progress, you really start noticing the unfairness and unfriendly playerbase that this game offers.

However, the horrible toxic players you have to get through to eventually play with the decent ones will turn people away and the horible server conictivity will push even more away.

												This is the best street basketball online game. Advantage- The every motion in a game is smooth.- Play with friend is very fun.- Have varies skill.Disadvantage- Sometime Connection to server is bad but my internet is okay.- The most of item in the game need a cash. (Then the rich get very high status in the game but no mean the rich can     play better than the other)- Need More Special Character. (I'm The rich. ^0^)			"

												Fun for a while but then you have to deal with ""Pay to Win"" players who spend real money on OP characters with boosted stats. Would be a great game if it just followed the ""Pay to Pretty"" format which offers players a premium experience without unbalancing the game for others. The current state of the game makes it unfair to people who don't drop real money. Also the cell shading does not mask ugly character design.			"
