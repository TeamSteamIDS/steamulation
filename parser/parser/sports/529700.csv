												finally TEW 2013 has found its way to Steam. I've played this game hundreds of hours before it was released on Steam.You run a wrestling company as either the owner or head booker and book the shows, sign wrestlers etc.Booking shows is as easy or as detailed as you want. You can let the AI book your shows or do it all on your own. There are basically no limits, pretty much anything you can think of can be done. You can also create your own Match types or angles.The default fantasy database that comes with the game is pretty good, a lot of people prefer it over real world databases. Speaking of real world databases: there are lots of top notch fan created mods available on the official forum: http://www.greydogsoftware.com/forum/showthread.php?t=525274So yeah, from someone who played every TEW game and also it's predecessor EWR: this game is highly recommended if you're looking for a quality wrestling managing game.

												Ive been playing these for many years and they are fantastic.  Some of the most in-depth simulation games to date.The learning curve is steep though, and this is certainly a niche game.  Hardcore simulation fans that like the business end of wreslting will find it amazing, the casual gamer will immediately refund it.			"

												10 x 6 = 608 x 7   = 569 x 9   = 81etc. etc. etc.Basically, this game is a glorified spreadsheet program. Your goal is to take known variables and combine them with hidden variables to get a rating that is as close to 100 as possible. For example: You create a show. In that show you have to create matches and ""angles."" Angles are basically the story elements. You pretty much have to just use your imagination. Seriously, all angles actually do is tell the program to compare the stats of two or more workers. In it's simplest form, (wrestler A) * (wrestler b) * (product, or fan expectations) = final rating. Now in reality, there are actually hundreds of variables to consider, but that's pretty much it. The storylines are whatever you say they are. You can do this because you are role playing. You can type whatever you want into the story field and it makes no difference at all. You can even leave it empty. Seriously, all I could think of while trying to create a story was that episode of Family Guy where Peter lets Stewie play with his sock.

So to recap: I paid $20 for a spreadsheet/calculator program where 90% of the gameplay is your imagination. I felt like I was playing D&D by myself.Damnit, WWE! Just give us back GM mode!And YES, I do know how to play the game. I spent several hours on Youtube watching tutorials.			"
