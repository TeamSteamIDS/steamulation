												This game is a lot of fun and a challeng.  Feels like shadow boxing, but looks like a mit VR work out with Bruce Lee. :)			"

												Fun simple little work out. Starts out easy and slow and pretty quickly ramps up to a good workout. I've only done about 20 minutes of it so far because >Fat< so it'll be a while before I get passed round 5 but I have to say I did feel good after playing, worn out, but good. For now it is just a simple time attack hit the glove targets and block hits but that's enough for me.			"

												Great workout! If you guys would incorporate training for slowly leaerning just how to bob and weave your game would be priceless! It's a bit furstrating trying to learn it within a level, getting smacked all the time :-) Please consider it.			"

												Good concept, but needs development.In my opinion, this game would be much more enjoyable with:- Proper height adjustment of the intructor > punches that should be directed to my face are hitting my body, making it extremely difficult to dodge- More menus for choosing exercises- More difficulty levelsI also feel that the price point should be lowered given the depth of this game.

												Played for 30 mins, got to level 8, and now I'm totally out of breath and my mussles are numb :)No matter what this game is lacking in content, it is a great workout!.If you try to beat your record on a daily basis in VR the results will show IRL "

												I was skeptical at first but after playing it for half an hour and sweating my ♥♥♥ off this was amazing. Just reached #5 on the leaderboards and i'm sweating my balls off, i mean just wow. This is an amazing cardio exercise. I truly hope there will be more updates to expand on the game. So far it's just the fight that goes up to a certain level and that's it. Hope to see more. Great game, highly recommend to anyone who enjoys exercise.			"

												A great boxing trainer for a decent workout. I hope there are updates like in the ring matches and varied punches, maybe the voice over match the lips of the bruce lee instructor, but it teaches you the three basic jabs, uppercuts, and hooks.			"

												Very simple, not much depth but has potential to grow.  I bought this for the fitness aspect and it hasn't let me down.  After 5 minutes of playing I was dripping with sweat.  The developer could add more modes and create a purely fitness aimed game.			"

												Legit good boxing work out. Arms are aching like hell next day and I only did x6 rounds. My friend got to round 9 and the sweat soaked the head set.. careful of that.			"

												Fun game, and definitely works you out. Downsides are there are no options to restart while you are in the middle and sometimes hooks don't register as hits.			"

												Has potential, but seem to have an issue with the hands, they are at a 90 degree angle to the controllers and left/right is mixed up, swapping controllers over doesnt help because then the gloves are completely wrong and it breaks any immersion you had. Some options would help.			"

												Clocking in 19 mins, I already feel more tired than I have the last 4 years of my life. I don't know how accurate this is to true boxing, but I learned that dodging by falling back (which was my natural instinct in all my 3 fights in life) is incredibly slow, and understand why people duck instead. I have a new found respect for boxing, where I used to think practicing with someone holding pads was stupid. It was also really fun and worth the $9. Gonna have to replay tomorrow.			"

												This game has an absolute bare minimum amount of content to be considered a game but I still can't help but enjoy it. It'd be great to be able to block or even spar but I have a feeling this isn't one of those games that ever gets updated.			"

												DISCLAIMER: If you have hit pads before, think carefully before you get this game. If you can, wait for patches that fix the issues.As another review has said:""This game has an absolute bare minimum amount of content to be considered a game but I still can't help but enjoy it""This is a great experience but at this price right now, this game in it's current state is not a smooth experience if you have ever hit actual pads before. There are 3 main problems:- The trainer animations can feel janky between the different punches. The trainer feels like he resets before putting the next pad up which can make punch combos feel really random, this feels arcadey rather than realistic. - Blocking doesn't work right now, you can only evade punches. The hitbox for evading punches is not bug free, if a punch just barely clips you, you get the same point deduction compared to a clean shot.- There is just one continous wave based mode. If you lose you have to start at 0 again. The dev needs to add other modes and needs to have wave select.Another minor problem is that the trainer sometines hold both pads up for you to do rapid right 1-2s. This mechanism makes the game feel so arcadey because if you want to maximise point and get to the next wave the player must throw tap puches rather than proper form punches. This is only a negative if you are looking for a genuine pad experience rather than an arcadey game.Despite these flaws, this game is a great workout if you throw your punches properly. That's why i recomment this game. For the first time in the history of man you can do pad work without requiring a trainer. To the developer, please don't give up on this game! It has so much potential!			"

												Superb workout in VR. Very simple premise of pad punching but it just works, the immersion is perfectly weighed and theirs good illusion of conecting with your hits. I wouldn't call this a game for fun at all, you'll get sweaty and tired within minutes. If you're looking to add variety to your excercise routine then this ticks the box.			"
