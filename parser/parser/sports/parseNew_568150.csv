												Still needs a little tweaking and some content updates but its still a genuinely fun game (especially with people that dont know video games ;) )			"

												Just played probably about 30 minutes and i noticed a few things wrong here 1. The controls. somehow when playing with WSAD or arrow keys sometimes it reverses my controls so that  iaccidently go up instead of going down etc.2. Its a bit laggy when it comes to rendering music inside the game. there are certain points of the game where it will lag freezing both pads but not the ball, so your forced to stay still and let the ball score on either side.overall its a fun game, but im sure this has been said before, it needs some tweaking.

												I may only have 30 minutes in the game, but it's so addicting and fun to play it's basically a new look and take on ""pong"" from many years ago.If you want you can add your own music and play it while playing yourself and see the arena get more hectic as you do.Once a few things get tweaked and maybe a few new features this small yet amazing game will be 200% worth your money.
