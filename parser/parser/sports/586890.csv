Early Access Review
								Local co-op with one controller for each player, but there's only one HMD, so how would that work?Anyway, I was alone at home so I played it by myself. One controller is the racket, the other controller some device that doesn't do anything at all? I could never get it to work in any of the different game modes.At the beach, I couldn't start any of the games.  In the other two locations it worked. I suspect this game is aimed at children, but the physics aren't so good (hitting a balloon doesn't feel real and sometimes the balloon goes through the racket). Balloons float down very slowly so there's no real excitement, maybe for 3-4 year olds? Balloons that fall on your head just pass through your body, which totally kills immersion. You play in a tiny, almost invisible glass cube and the balloons can't leave the cube, so you don't have to move at all.  I have a 6-year old daughter but this is not going to be able to hold her attention for longer than 60 seconds max, and then probably never again. Too bad, I wish there were more quality VR games for children.			"
