												I really like GRID 2 and I think it's the best racing game on Steam. Just keep in mind that it's not a racing simulator like GRID. It's Need for Speed: Greatest Hits. I can see huge chunks of various NFS games put into the game nicely like Touge on the California Dixon track at night is a canyon race from Carbon, sponsor decals, body and performance mods are from Underground, circuit races strongly remind me of ProStreet. Cote d'Azur track alone reminds me of Porsche Unleashed and brings a smile to my face. Codemasters made a great arcade racing game.Strong sides of the game: gorgeous graphics, awesome physics in terms of car behavior, great online matchmaking, single player campaign is fun to play and interesting to progress, AI can be easily adjusted to a desired difficulty.Minor complaints that I have: there's no way to change the in-game assistant's voice. Personally I really dislike that voice and ended up muting it. Many games have an option to change the voice that talks to you while you play 'cause it's important! You're stuck with this voice for hundreds of hours. In Crysis I was able to choose the voice of the nanosuit (male/female/robotic), in SR: TT and many other games there're similar options. The DLCs certainly crippled the game. Extra tracks and cars just don't fit in properly, e. g. you can't use Ford Sierra RS500 online and nobody races on Bathurst unless you create a custom lobby and invite friends to play it. The lack of cockpit view is an insult. I also miss Ferrari, Lamborghini and Porsche cars, but don't get me wrong, there's a lot of cars to play with.			"

												I got this game on sale, and I wanted to like this game, I really did. I loved the first GRID. The graphics are really nice, among the best for a racing game when it came out. The single-player story mode is cheesy, but it does okay to fill the gaps between races. The engine sounds are mostly accurate, far more so than the first GRID game. It's really unfortunate that this is where the good parts of the game end.The driving physics are awful. Literally some of the worst I've ever played. I understand they wanted to focus on drifting and making it a key component of racing, but it is so poorly implemented that certain vehicles are essentially unplayable. Driving the Koenigsegg Agera R is a nightmare... it feels exactly like driving on ice, which I have actual experience with, living in a place that gets really cold during the winter with tons of snow. It's really a shame that ALL of the cars drift. All of the vehicles, regardless of being described as ""Balanced"" and / or ""Grip"" when you select them, will drift, no matter how perfect you try to take a corner. As soon as you hit the brakes, you can feel the vehicle start to fishtail. Some cars are okay, but I've found at least 50% of the time, racing is just not an enjoyable experience.Even worse is the computer AI. They drive their line and regardless of if they hit a wall, if you bump them, and even if you try to spin them out, it's nearly impossible, they do not make mistakes. It feels exactly like a crappy simulation, minus actually simulating anything.I did enjoy the first 18 hours or so in the single-player game. Really the coolest part of the game was my second race when I drove up the side of a mountain, fell back down on top of the opponent's car, and still won the race. However, after over 21 hours, I've finally put my controller down in frustration, and most likely will not pick it back up for this game.			"

Before I proceed to the review, you should know that personally I'm racing games addict and cars lover from kid. You should know that I raced in many online leagues in reputable simulator: rFactor - it could have been even 800-1000 driven hours. You may ask ""why have you stepped back to GRID?"" - it's simple: I don't have time for preparations to compete in online leagues (1 race = whole week of training).Here's where the GRID2 steps in!HistoryGRID2 is the successor of Race Driver: GRID released in 2008, and it represents the same idea.. but somehow better. At first I need to refer into the roots of the first part of GRID - do you remember a game series called TOCA Race Driver? If not, Codemasters produced that series between 1997 and 2006. Because the sales were dropping, Codemasters decided to abandon TOCA and introduce new brand referring to the old product - Race Driver: GRID. I've personally played TOCA Race Driver 3 and I remember that game featured races not only in sportscars but also Monster Trucks and some motocross ones. It was therefore not only asphalt oriented races like the new GRID series. The success of Race Driver: GRID was an indicator to create a new game as GRID2.SingleplayerIn GRID2 you become professional racing driver from rookie just like in Race Driver: GRID. Your first race at Chicago circuit is the tutorial one before you become part of the WSR league (World Series Racing). After first race you're heading into your racing garage. The game features of a manager helping you to start your career. The campaign is very interesting because you start it from the rookie point of view: slow cars (Tier 1). Interesting thing introduced in GRID2 is that after every race you're not rewarded by money. You're rewarded by the number of fans that you got by completing the race. The game makes you feel like you're really important driver in that league. After a couple of races and challenges you need to complete the final one to get into higher tier. Every new tier brings new tracks from all over the world, game modes and of course new cars. Finishing the campaign on the difficulty set to high with all the achievements (50/60 without the DLCs) took me about 30-40 hours of playtime.Features* Game modes: Race, Elimination, Checkpoint and Faceoff.* Retrospection - the feature known from Race Driver: GRID, gives you the ability to rewind the time and correct your mistakes* There are some tracks based on the real life circuits like: Algarve, Red Bull Ring, Abu Dhabi and there are many configurations of the tracks* Cars are well balanced with their advantages and disadvantages measured on different tracks* Anti-cut-track system which gives you penalty (stop/go) for cutting the track* You can always change the difficulty and damage level* If you set the damage level to the highest, you can end up the race for example on the wall very easily* Very good graphics engine and optimalizations (playable on nVidia 9600 GT)* Nice destruction model and detailed statistics about your driver's career like in Race Driver: GRIDPhysicsThe game physics is demanding and the tracks are very well made with bumps and kerbs affecting the stability of the car. You can't set the details of the physics like traction control or ABS cause the physics is simplified. You need skills to control the situation all over the time. If you make a mistake, you pay for it. The physics gives slight advantage to those who oversteer the car in turns and drift while the FWD cars don't understeer as they should. You need to remember that the grip is changing depending on the surface. I would rate the physics as 70% arcade 30% simulation.MultiplayerAlive with many players as it's the extention of singleplayer mode. There are some moments where there's nobody to play with but that's a rare situation. The MP is hard because you start with the basic cars good for some tracks but bad for others. You need to race in order to receive money and buy better cars. Buying new cars isn't the end of story because afterwards you can modify them (of course by paying money). In the DLCs there are some paid cars that make the competition a little bit unfair. For example Mitsubishi Evo X is probably the best drift car in the game, better than the free ones. The anti-cut-track system is not perfect in some situations because there are places where huge cutting (cheating) won't give you the penalty. It's also popular that the penalized driver (stopped for a couple of seconds) does a very bad thing to others: he directs himselft on the path of incoming opponents to caught them on his bumper. It's also reffering to the culture of players because some of them race only to eliminate others, but it's better than it sounds :)ControllersI've tested the game on keyboard and externals: controller Logitech F310 and wheel Logitech G25. The controllers are well discovered and set perfectly. Some cars like Koenisegg are created to be the fastest and hardest so even on the wheel there's a lack of grip on that car and losing control. In general I can tell you that the cars from Tier 4 can be handed perfectly only on the wheel but I disliked doing it in MP.Drawbacks and issues* Anti-cut-track bugs on some tracks* Lack of cockpit camera which was in the Race Driver: GRID* Lack of the option to change the degree lock for wheel* Lack of balancing feature in MP - players are always mixed with different level and skill.* The serious issue I have is: problem with not saving the options to the configuration file (it's locked all the time so I can't even read it). I need therefore to change the graphics options everytime I run the game while there's no problem with the settings of controller (they are in different file). I got used to it but I have the same issue in Race Driver: GRID so maybe it's Windows 8.1 related issue.SummaryTo sum up the review, in my opinion GRID2 is worth the money. It provides a lot of fun both in singleplayer and multiplayer and on every controller. To this day I still enjoy the multiplayer and I was also invited to drive for one of the Polish leagues - Goes Like Hell. I don't treat it seriously cause I play GRID2 for chillout, but it's the next challenge for me and possibility for players to spend here many more hours.Race Driver: GRID or GRID2?The 1st part is a little more like simulation so my advice would be: enjoy your playtime at first in Race Driver: GRID and when you'll finish it, buy GRID2 :)Game tested on:AMD Phenom II X4 945, Nvidia 9600, Windows 8.1			"

												I want to clear up that im not going to include Grid 1 to this review. Gameplay on the tracks are mainly based on acrade style racing. Its all about investment in a new league of sport and becoming the number #1 contender and the number 1# fan.What I like about Grid 2 are the tracks. They are fun and challenging to race on in career mode and online. The car personaliztion is near enough good, throwing in real life sponsors to put onto your car and personalize. I was disappointed with the physics in use of the cars as the developers focused on the powersliding instead of clean turn exits to build better momentum through the corners. You may think thats essential for a great game but the handling will lead you to wreckless driving in most modes challenged on. Online as an example is almost unplayable for these reasons because players cant take full stable control around the corners for a clean race. Another thing I was disapointed in was the input controls on the game. For a controller it wont be much of a problem driving cars but for keyboard users it will be. Most racing inputs ive used was the simple w,s,a,d & (Arrows) and have no issues playing them smootly. For Grid 2 its difficult as its not keyboard friendly in a way of keeping your car stable around the corners and attempting most clean races. Ive tried both controller (F710)  & keyboard and its a major difference how you perform in the game.Cockpit is not required in the game which is another downside for a latest racing release. DLC packs have been scattered around as typical developers want more money off you. Pros:+ Tracks to drive on+ PersonalztionCons:- Controls are unstable- Not Keyboard friendly compare to most racing games- No Cockpit- Codemasters greedy DLC Schemes- Graphics are not as good for its ageMy rating: 65/100Metascore rating: 80/100Conclusion:I dont reccomend this game full price for the aspects ive pointed out from it. If steam provide a discount give it a go and see what you think. Hope you make the right decision on purchasing the game.			"

												This game is no simulator, and i've only played with gamepad. After 7 hours I have to say i'm disssapointed, coming from GRID 1.The game now focuses on city circuits with different gamemodes (Elimination, circuit changes on the go...) and doesn't focus on real competitions like the first one no Open wheel/DTM/GT/LMP classes of events and no Lemans Resistance races when the season ends. In 7 hours i've only visited 4 circuits so far, with no serious competition on them (just regular races, with different car classes on the same race), and the handling i'd say is a bit worse than on the first, with they wanting you to drift in every corner.The plot of the game is to make a new series of racing globally, taking the best drivers of each part of the world. in each part of the world there are different gamemodes. (guess what: in japan they drift)The game also feels like it puts together different vehicle classes and they more or less perform the same (Chevrolet Camaro against a Alfa Romeo 4C comes to mind)And the whole point of 'we have to get fans from social networks to talk about us' with the TV show stuff (The game's storyline, i'd say) just feels for 12 years old. I'd say they wanted to make the game easier for younger people. I really liked GRID 1, but this one is average, shouldn't call itself GRID.			"

												If you like games like Burnout and Need 4 Speed. You might like this game. If you're expecting an experience along the lines of something like Forza or GT look somewhere else.   I myself can't hate this game enough. I hate everything about it. Codemasters feels the need to infuse GRID and DIRT with this huge amount of 'bro talk', MT DEW and fake pop culture. Which really just makes me sick. It's insulting. The track line up is laughable as well. I can't think of anything positive to say about this game besides it's not for everyone. Some out there will find GRID 2 to be just what they need. The Burnout, and Need 4 Speed type of players. Nothing wrong with that.  I simply hate this game. The original GRID was so much more enjoyable and I was hoping to find that with GRID 2. That enjoyment was nowhere to be found for me.			"

												This review is focused on the singleplayer aspect of this game.Pros:- Fairly nice to look at- Good sound design- Bathurst- Decent length careerCons:- Handling inferior to the original GRID- I have seen better AI in N64 racing games- AI vehicles are also far stronger than player vehicle, which causes trouble with the high likelihood of AI colliding with player- Rubbing against a wall while turning a corner may result in a sudden outbreak of the Flips- No longer has the 'build your own racing team' style of the original, which I feel makes the game less appealing- Have to pay extra for Bathurst (and on that note, there is quite a catalogue of DLC which indicates that a decent amount of content was cut from the game for DLC, the same problem was had with DiRT 3.)This is not really a bad game. However, it is inferior to its predecessor- your money would be much better spent on that.Still could be worth picking up on sale if you are a fan of the series though.			"

												Game is good but i don't recommend it for a few reasons unless it's on sale or you can get it from a trader:_ ""Racenet"" If you want to do the global challenges or fully enjoy the multiplayer experience you need to have an account, like the rival thing. I thought your Steam friends are your rivals but no no, only racenets friends are your rivals._ DLC you have not many cars unless you buy the dlc, also some circuits are only available after you buy overpriced DLC (5$, 6$, 10$)_ Your car is made of ♥♥♥♥ing polysteren when your opponents car are made of titanium. Ram them while taking a turn you fly away, stick behind them but keep accelerating you'll go at their speed and they wont even flinch. If they ram you during a turn you can be sure you'll loose control of your vehicle. If they're behind you pushing and you try to slow down or break you'll loose control, if you keep at your pace the back of your car will go sideways until you loose control. Driving a muscle car and getting hit by a roadster still makes you fly + damage your vehicle. _ Drift cars, the worst thing in this game and there's plenty of race to do with these. The cars keep oversteering._ Pinball effect, if you hit a wall you'll bounce on the ramp on the other side of the road._ Sometimes if you're against the wall and hit a cone your car will explode._ Opponents are driving at your speed, if you're slow they'll be slow. If you're ahead of them they'll catch up with you no matter how perfect you're racing._ Except for you there's never any crash, if you're causing a pile up you'll be the only one ending up off road. The opponents will follow their racing lanes no matter what's happening ahead.I think that pretty much sums up why i can't recommend this game, maybe these seem like small things but when every races you're the only one loosing control (and not just a little) once there's frictions between you and your opponent that you have to restart or  go back in time every time it gets irritating.About the good things of this game?_ Graphics are pretty neat_ Different kind of events (Touge, Race, Time Attack, Drifts, Endurance, Takeover etc)_ Car customisation_ Decent career mode.

												Bought this game because I was a huge fan of the first game. I've been disapointed with this one. The graphics are improved and the damage model is still excellent. My problem is the handling and physics of the game. They just seem off. I spent most of the time starting out only drifting around turns (I hate drifting). Once I got it more figured out it got better but is still disapointing. Also not to mention that there is a lack of a cockpit view in the game. I got this game on summer sale for a great price and still feel like a wasted my money. There are better racing games out there if you are interested in buying one. I don't recomend this one unless you want to give it a try and don't have to spend much money on it.UPDATE: So I don't believe many people realize what I'm trying to explain. So let me go into some more details. The game is beatuiful, amazing in looks. The damage looks real and the system for the career looks like it's great and laid out very well. The handling of the cars is what really turns me off from this. It's a cross between an arcade racer and a simulator. This compared to arcade racers is much harder and this compared to simulaters such as Gran Turismo is a joke. If you are willing to tweke settings and work on controlling the car perfectly its worth a buy but if you are just interested in jumping into a car and racing avoid it.I like my simulators and Iike arcade racing games. Games like GRID 1, Forza, Gran Turismo, Burnout, Need for Speed all have pros and cons. Same with the game it has pros and cons. I tend to fall on a con side not liking this very much. I guess part is I was such a huge fan of GRID 1 that this one has changed so much I dislike it but I would rather play either a true arcade racer that I know what I'm getting or a true Simulator that I know how the car will handle. These crossover games that are an inbetween style I really don't like and hope they will fade out. If you try the game and like it great! If not it's probably a similar reason as me, it's not dedicated to one style of racing games it tries to hit both and misses the mark.			"

												People are very critical with this game saying:- Controls are pretty arcade- You can turn and you must turn in every corner with a big fat drifting move- It is not a true successor to GRID (1)Actually:- Controls are pretty arcade- You can turn and you must turn in every corner with a big fat drifting move- It is not a true successor to GRID (1)So why I still recommend this game? Sure it is arcade and if you have ever driven a car with more than 200 HP than you will probably say this is bU11$h'""+t. I have not done it before. So I can say in here it is so much fun. There are a lots of nice cars, from the street and from the racing tracks also. Driving really gives you the 'fast' feeling unlike other racing games (and yes here I meant NFS). Tracks are also nice (altough maybe some more would be better but it is still enough for a career game). Graphics are okay I guess, the effects are cool but there are some details when you feel that it could have been done nicer - maybe it was a price to pay to let older PCs also run this.  If you like fast cars and you do not mind some little mistakes and arcade-ness this game is just for you. Else you should go with a real sim.			"

												I anxiously awaited this game.  For years I watched Codemasters release ""F1"" and uninspiring ""Dirt ""titles waiting for a followup to the original Race Driver: Grid.   When I finaly got my wish I found very little of the original GRID DNA.  Tracks are gorgeous but few in number.  Car control isn't as good as the original and it seems Codemasters has come down with a serious case of ""Need For Speed"" -Itis.  In other words, The game constantly pushes DLC and relies on a quirky multiplayer engine akin to EA's Autolog.  The real problem is, that unless you pay to play you're not going to get very far in MP racing.  The game is pale in comparison to the original and wasn't worth the wait IMHO.			"

												This is a fun arcade-racer that I have really enjoyed playing since I bought it back in September 2014, Some people like to base it off the original Grid, but this game is definitely has more of an arcade feel to it while Grid 1 I felt was more of a simulator. The Online Multiplayer Racing can be fun and enjoyable once you get the hang of the driving style that the game brings to the table and also when you make friends with a bunch of other respectable racers also... The sad things about the Online is that it is dying (I suggest you switch your download region on steam to London-UK to find more people) and there are those occasional hackers every now and then that can ruin the fun, but I enjoy the hell out of this game and playing with my racing buddies... I would recommend you buy this game when it is on sale, the $50 price tag for the reloaded edition is kind of expensive when you look at the age of the game. If you are an arcade racing game fan, I would recommend this game to you. I would believe you would enjoy this game.			"

												I think the biggest problem of this game is in it's name: if it wouldn't have been called ""GRID"" it could get away with what it is. But people look at it and expect the experience they had with Racedriver: GRID, which this game doesn't deliver.First of all, unlike Rd:Grid the game doesn't allow the player to customize his driving experience. Rd:Grid was like ""you wanna play with keyboard? fine, here is a bunch of assists so you can handle the car with those keys. you get better at it, turn some of them off and get extra enjoyment!"" or ""ofcourse a car would slide, but only if you are not carefull enough with the throttle in the exit of the corner. still cannot tame it? just move the TC slider a little bit backwards"". This freedoms resulted in great accessebility and immense fun of driving whatever you input device was. Instead, GRID 2 says ""we got TrueFeel(tm), we have World SIDEWAYS Racing, we are all flashy and hooked up on fans which you gotta impress, so you are going to play the game OUR way!""Obligatory drifting. Oh gosh, i didn't think i ever see it this series. Thing is, you cannot tell if you are faster without it. It has  become part of the game.Again, comparing to Rd:Grid, sliding the car was never an option if you were going to set a time. You would go for a clean line, resorting to sliding in rare instances, and yet it was fully up to the player. Sliding a corner made you feel ""Hahaha yeah!"" or ""Oops, steady, steady!"". GRID 2 does it like ""Right, here we go again..."".Not knowing all that, I jumped into it with my itching fingers ready over arrow keys and was for a surprise. ""OK, it won't be easy"", i thought, and i got better at it, although still failing to have as much fun as i expected. But i kept my hopes up by thinking, ""OK, maybe if i get a controller, i might actualy get to enjoy it..."". WRONG. No ingame customization for controller device leaves it almost as clunky as keyboard. (to be fair there might be a way to make it better by editing xml file, but that's yet to find out). As it turned out, reading different forums, the game was desigined primarily for full-on steering wheel controllers, walking straight past keyboards and pads like they are history. Only a handfull of those hardcore devices seem to provide a player with  full control over the car. Yet in a game, that positions itself as leaning towards arcade driving experience...Another complaint is the track design. There are not a lot of tracks and locations to choose from. Racing tracks are alright. The trouble hides on city circuits and winding road courses. Like if half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥controls isn't enough, these end up being littered with hazards, things to hit or send a car flying off the road. Moreover, there simply isn't enough room for 12 hotheads to have their way through, making every game mode a demolition derby. This was not an issue in Rd:Grid.Coupled with turtle-paced progression of multiplayer, which doesn't reward you for anything besides placing in top 3, you will soon find that if you can't enjoy the driving in this game, there is nothing else left to look for.

												GRID 2 tries to bring a sort of story element to its career progression. Longtime fans of Codemasters’ racing games might remember the TOCA Race Driver series implementing the same idea. In regards to GRID 2, it’s about one American billionaire called Patrick Callahan, who is launching a new franchise – World Series Racing (WSR) – and has noticed your dazzling skills in the game’s opening introduction race. From there, you become the material to promote WSR across the world and are given the challenge to bring more people to the sport. How do you do this? By beating all the other rivals around the world.An assortment of events populate each season in GRID 2. For example, the first season is set in America and involves racing from point A to point B, but then you move to season three, which is set in Asia and includes events like Touge and Drifting. Along the way you’ll also get to participate in elimination races and overtake challenges. It’s fantastic that the game is throwing a varied amount of events at the player. Making your way through the seasons introduces more powerful cars. Even though GRID 2 includes around 45 cars, it manages to cover a range of types.AI, for the most part, is good and feels to have been given an aggressive characteristic, as these racers aren’t afraid to grind metal with metal with the player. Codemasters has managed to pinpoint that line between realism and arcade racing, allowing anyone who enjoys racing games but isn’t into those that try to represent a serious realism of the sport to come to GRID 2 and get in with humble ease. Online multiplayer is great fun. Players can set up their own playlist of events and what cars to use. At first, the online is limited with its vehicle selection, since the online multiplayer has its own level-up system. Hitting a target level will unlock more cars, which you can then purchase with the earnings you get from taking part in race events online.GRID 2 is a fantastic looking game on the PC. The cars look great and tracks shine with plenty of details. Sound design is brilliant, with loud, roaring car engines blasting out, giving that sense of power coming from high-performance cars.The return of the GRID franchise isn’t as ground-breaking as I would have hoped, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a great racer.

												The biggest issue with GRID 2 (and GRID 1 to an extent) is how much of a realist are you?If realism and or simulation of how race cars really handle is important to you, then GRID 2 is the worst of the bunch.A comparision I like to make on how the cars feel in Grid 2 is with Ridge Racer as the handling in GRID 2 follows the same overly eager grip that allows you to take a 90 degree turn at 120 mph. While the realism of GRID 2 is no where as dumbed down as a title like Ridge Racer, it IS pretty basic. If you have ANY experience in driving an automobile over 90 mph, then you will knowthat the cars in GRID 2 do not behave realistically at all.Graphically the game is fine. Nice effects that don't bog my system down.However, the gameplay and races themselves tend to get stale rather quickly.Once you have raced a certain type of race don't expect to see much difference in setup, length or quality of the AI from race to race either.The AI doesn't ""get better"" or any such luck, what you start with is what you get.The multiplayer in GRID 2 is dead (in the US at least) and has been for a long time.I have yet to find one single multiplayer session located in the US and no one ever joined any sessions I created.In the U.K. their seems to be a bigger following to non-oval type racing and so you can usually find more multiplayer options, but not many Steam users are willing to fiddle with Steam settings to get locked into U.K. race servers.All and all, GRID 2 was a big step back in the series with features missing, or massive DLC to get the whole package required.I hear GRID Autosport (Grid 2.5?) is a step back to the Grid 1 roots, but to be honest GRID 2 destroyed my faith in the GRID franchise to keep me away from any hope of liking it again anytime soon.If you are looking for a good arcade racer, GRID 2 is fine in short bursts.However, if you are the type to invest in a wheel and pedals and know the difference in how a car handles with or without automatic gear box, then I would stay away from GRID 2.

 About GRID 2	I have always been a fan of racing games, playing titles from NFS to GRID to DiRT to Forza, Nascar, and more. For PC, I must say that the GRID series, minus the first game, is phenomenal. GRID 2 deviates from its prior by balancing simulation-level damage and graphics with arcade-style racing. While there are a few things that were missed, such as an in-car view, the huge selection of vehicles, tracks, and environments make this game really stand out. Release Date: 28 May, 2013 Single Player Campaign	GRID 2 has a fantastic storyline. You are a new driver, trying to make a name for yourself and your racing league, WSR. You're led by the confident Patrick Callahan, who keeps you up to date on promo events, passing in races, and reminding you of sponsor objectives. The game is split into ""seasons,"" with each season taking place in a different region. At season 4, you race at tracks globally. In general, each season means a new tier of cars, but there is some overlap, making seasons 3 and 4 both T3 races. There are difficulties suitable for anyone, from racing newcomers to GRID experts. There are multiple race types, such as Endurance, Time Attack, Overtake, Drift, Race, Touge, and more, all of which are very enjoyable. The only caveat I find with any of the game modes is when playing Touge, the aggressiveness of your opponent will count against you, even if they hit you. Just avoid aggresion in this mode, and you'll be fine.Online Multiplayer	The GRID 2 community is alive and well, and the forums are still relevant. Performance is great online, and you can upgrade your cars to suit your own driving style. If I remember correctly, multiplayer lobbies can go up to 12 players at once, but please correct me if I'm wrong. Even when you beat the Single Player Campaign, you will still have loads of fun in online multiplayer.Replay Factor	One of the things that I look for in a game is whether or not it is enjoyable to play a second time, after you beat it once. I must say that this is one area where this game excels. I often found myself retrying races with different vehicles to beat my lap times, rise in the leaderboards, or just to see the difference each made.The Graphic	GRID 2 supports a wheel & pedals setup, but I simply use a keyboard. While there are disadvantages to doing so, i.e. pressing W is equivalent to going pedal-to-the-metal 24/7, the steering is very managable and drifting is easy to pick up on. The graphics are fantastic. I don't quite know what graphics engine this game runs, but I play the game on Ultra settings at 50-60 fps on a GTX 860M. It's optimized incredibly well, and lighting, shadows, and reflections all look great. You certainly won't have weather effects anywhere near games such as Project CARS or Assetto Corsa, but the game will be just fine for the vast majority of players.All in All  GRID 2 is a really nice Racing Game!9/10 From Me Sweep "

												According to some statistics made by the developers, they removed interior view since only like 30% used it and upon playing the game for a while you'll discover that was not the only thing they removed to save development cost and time.Pro:- Good graphics.- Decent audio, apart from the obnoxious low frequency noises switching between menus.- Fun for a short while.- Damage model- Online demolition derby.Cons:- Lack of interrior view.- Lack of any game music/theme.- No rear view mirror, you have to look back.- Extremely annoying slow animation transitions between menus, customisation..etc (aesthetics infavor of functionality)- Pure arcade car handling.- Most cars if not all are drift happy, as the game rewards drifting even in circuit racing.- Extremely annoying announcer everywhere with a sense of humor matching a cheesy car salesman, and unskipable.- Pay 2 win dlcs for online racing, as you get very few cars for online racing.- Rubberbanding AI.Overall impression: meh... skip it.

												While I enjoyed my time with GRID 2 (playing the campaign to completion), I can't in good conscience recommend it as a good example of a racing game.The odds in the game are pretty much stacked against you every which-way. If an opponent touches you your car will, nine times out of ten, spin out and you lose a ridiculous amount of ground. However, if YOU touch an opponent, you'll still receive the brunt of the damage and time lost. The AI relies wholly on rubber-banding too - drive badly, they will be more forgiving, drive well, and they'll go toe to toe with you. The gamemodes are generally enjoyable. The problem is how the game creates progression late-game. Instead of new tracks, the game simply extends old ones, or, by season 5, makes you do the same 6 mile course three times over. This wears thin quickly, and the endgame feels more like a grind than an edge-of-your-seat world championship.The game looks nice, the tracks are nice - hell, the cars are nice (if you're prepared to drop upwards of $5 to use the good ones). But when the actual gameplay is as infuriating as GRID 2 is, it really isn't worth your time/money - particularly at full price. I happpened across my copy in a Humble Bundle, and I'd be wary of paying any more than the $4 I shelled out for that bundle on this game alone.			"

Value I purchased GRID 2 on Steam during the 2015 Summer Sale, but I did have it installed previously. Feel free to add about 15 hours to my Steam timelog for it to make up for this. You can pick it up for USD $7.50 as of writing during this ""North Pole Noir"" sale, and you certainly won't regret it. There are  number of DLC packs, all of which I personally do own but don't use very often. I feel like Codemasters hit the sweet spot with the DLC attractiveness, as there are plenty of cars in the base game that will outperform the DLC vehicles, but some of the DLC packs offer more vibrant patterns. For example, the base game's T3 Honda will outperform the T3 DLC Camaro SS, but the Camaro SS is a fantastic looking car. The reloaded edition of this game is probably the best deal you will get, at least when it is on sale.Here's a rundown of each aspect of the game and how I would personally rate it.  Aspect Rating   Physics 10   Plot 10   Damage 9   Multiplayer 10   Community 10   Graphics 10+   Value 8   Overall 9.5  Final Points on the Game Not only is GRID 2 the best racing game in its class, the unique storyline makes up from something looked over in most racing games.

												This game is not like any other Codemasters racer. They went full on Arcade this time, with a big focus on drifting. A normal race is more about drifting around corners than about finding the fastest racing line. It is almost like OutRun, you just are slower if you don't drift your way around corners. The rewind feature makes a return, further solidifying the arcade direction the series has taken with this sequel.There is no cockpit view or car setup and tuning options are minimal and only available in multiplayer. Multiplayer may appear deserted and it does suffer from low population because of matchmaking regions being based upon your Steam download server's location. There is a lively multiplayer community, but to play with more people you need to change your Steam download region to UK - London and preferably also own all of the DLC packages to get better matchmaking.In multiplayer your goal is to gain money and experience to level up to unlock new cars and upgrades which you then have to buy with the money you earned. Your multiplayer experience can be a mixed bag then in itself. In ""Playlists"" there is no voting on game modes or choice of circuits, instead the lobby is assigned a random track, car tier and gamemode. Players then have the ability veto the combination once. If the combination is vetoed you are assigned another random combination without the ability to veto it.  There is also the ""Custom Events"" option which are events hosted by other players. You gain less money and experience from participating in ""Custom Events,"" and only the lobby host can decide the settings of the event. The host has a wide variety of changeable settings, varying from type of event to forcing every player to use manual gears. There is a system called ""Impact Ratings"" in the multiplayer, which shows other players how dirty their opponents race. These are represented by circles with exclamation marks in them, with the ranking going White-Green-Yellow-Red from the best to the worst. Players with too little data to assign them an ""Impact Rating"" show as grey. The rating persists over races, and can change over time. Lots of online races tend to have people crashing into each other a lot, so do not pay too much mind to your ""Impact Rating."" When ""Impact Ratings"" are enabled, you gain a small cash bonus at the end of the race based on your rating.Also available in the Multiplayer menu are the ""Global Challenges."" These are a set of random events raced on certain circuits with either a certain Tier of cars or a specific car. Instead of racing head-to-head with another player, this game mode is leaderboard based. The game tracks your performance in the events and compares your scores to your friends. The person on the top of the leaderboard is considered to be leading the event. There are medals on the events, granting you small amounts of money and experience for passing their requirements. Based on your position on the leaderboard in the specific events you gain points for the overall leaderboard which shows who among your friends is the best racer overall. The set of events changes every few days with the leaderboards wiped at the same time.The ""Singleplayer Career"" mode casts you as the rising new talent in the fictional new racing series called World Series Racing or WSR for short. In the singleplayer you proceed through ""Seasons"" of the series, completing events and unlocking new cars from challenges. As you progress through the career you gain access to more exotic cars, going from the old muscle cars and small European hatchbacks of Tier 1 to immensely powerful and rare cars like the Koenigsegg Agera R in Tier 4. The car selection has more of an emphasis on normal street legal cars rather than Touring Cars and the like. There is no Circuit de la Sarthe or the LMP class cars to be found in this game. The circuit selection varies from fantasy street courses to real life race tracks like Brands Hatch, Indianapolis and Yas Marina. Unlike the multiplayer, the cars are simply unlocked by completing separate challenges, and cannot be upgraded. The looks of the cars can be customised with paint colour, vinyls, wheels and sponsorship logos. The sponsors also have specific challenges for you to complete. Your progress throughout the career is tracked by the amount of ""Fans"" you have. You gain fans from completing sponsor objectives and placing well in events. The ""Fans"" statistic is hidden in Codemasters' ""Racenet"" service in the multiplayer, and has no real effect on that part of the game.I don't like how the AI can nudge your car around but you really can't do the same to them. I played the game mostly on Medium difficulty, and it is easy if you just race very physically, using the other cars to navigate corners. The AI gets really challenging on Hard and becomes a far more frustrating experience. In my opinion there is noticeable gap in the AI skill between Hard and Medium that really shows in the way they react to you driving aggressively.Graphically GRID 2 looks very impressive. The crashes look nice with parts flying off and shrapnel scattering all over. The stages look nicely detailed: urban stages have detailed buildings surrounding you as you race down the streets. Forest stages look threatening with hills and dense forest just outside the track, ready to punish from the slightest mistakes with formidable damage. The game is also very well optimised and runs well even on older hardware. Sounds are probably the weakest part of the game, with similar engine sounds for most of the cars and a very annoying tire squeal sound effect. There is also the sound of crowds cheering, but beyond that ambient sounds are nonexistent.Grid 2 is a solid arcade racer with great graphics, but is sadly hamstrung by its emphasis on drifting over real racing lines, stagnant AI and multiplayer which frequently devolves to a demolition derby. Fans of more arcade racing games like the Need For Speed series will find much to like here, while fans of the more realistic approach of the first game should give this game a pass.			"

												I wasn't sure if I could recommend it or not. The game can be fun, but it might be frustrating either.First of all: the sngle player mode. Basically your goal is to beat Harrison Carter (a bot), who always finishes first or second (if you're first). The rest of bots is always drunk so don't even mind them. A car driven by AI which is in front of you is always slower than you. It can't drift, never puts pedal to the metal. Is it easy to overtake them? Of course not. The roads are usually so narrow that you're usually blocked by AI cars. If any other car touches yours or you touch it, you'll instantly spin out so don't even try to crash the bots. And here goes the magic! Whenever a car driven by AI is behind you, it starts driving like a pro: never uses break, never reduces speed, never touches anything (and if so, its car isn't damaged at all). It overtakes you in a moment and then it becomes the slow one again. Oh and the best thing, you always starts from the second to last position so have fun with being blocked by cars in front of you and being bumped by cars behind you.The multiplayer is totally unfair. Guy who starts from better position (especially the first and the second) has always a huge adventage. If he is as good as you, and has a good car you have no chance to overtake him. Also there isn't really any punishment for attacking others so feel free to be a♥♥♥♥♥♥and keep on hitting any car you want.Multiplayer is fun when you play with your friends (unless they play fair).

												Good graphics, decent car list. That about sums up the positives.The physics, oh boy. To be quick, you have to drift, which in itself goes against ANY logic, at least on tarmac. And the way you drift is moronic as well- the car just steps out, no matter what you do. If you try driving sensibly, you understeer like you're running bald summer tires in snow. If you don't want to do so, you have to drift, but how can you do it properly when throttle control basically doesn't exist? It just boggles my brain that a game of this pedigree can handle worse than Mario Kart 64.This is the worst driving game I own by far. I regret spending 6EUR on it, even though it was in a bundle. Speaking of which, can you refund Humble Bundle games?			"

												Dear God, what have you done to GRID?Still insisting on finishing it as a fan, halfway through season 2 I realized they must've said something like ''Lets not bother with putting actual damage mechanics, simulation aspects from the original game, cockpit view etc, but instead, lets give the cars absurd physics and call it a simulation''.No matter which difficulty setting you're playing on (tried all), your car is your biggest opponent. It will constantly try to spin no matter what you do, just staying on the road is a challenge and it gets better and better when an opponent actually 'touches' your car, no matter which position, no matter what speed, say hello to the wall over there.I'll probably finish it for the sake of achievements and completion but hell, doing it with a vw golf because it's one of the few cars that manages to stay on the damned road is a shame...Screw graphics, go buy the original GRID, still beats this one.

												TLDR at the bottom.I came into this expecting a better and updated Grid 1, a worthy successor to a pretty decent (although flawed) racing game.What i got was a chineese bootleg of need for speed.Grid 1's physics though quirky and in dire need of a few small fixes have been thrown completely out the window in favour of some simplified super arcady system that bears no resembelance of realism to the first one.Grid 1's cars had a ""points rating"" for performance 4/5 5/5 ect. This is not a very good system but in Grid 2 they have moved to an even worse system where each stat of performance is a bar. This makes comparing cars virtually impossible. not to mention the majority of cars share the same statline.the cutscenes are cringeworthy, They strike right into the heart of the ""old white man trying to appeal to young kids of the digital age"" as if the game is almost a parody of itself. The ESPN sections are especially cringeworthy, i wonder how much their paid for licensing to an american only complay for an american live action cutscene THAT IS UNSKIPPABLE. Atleast they have done away with the horrible sponsor screen from GRID 1. that would take  way too long to scroll. Grid 2 allows you to skip alot of parts.Pros:More carsUpdated GraphicsPost-Race Sponsor rundownCons:Physics is terribleunskippable cringeworhty cutscenesPhysics are awfulAI is on rails & cheatsThe game is legitimately not fun to drive in.By far the worst event is the random track events without a co-driver or minimap its a random chance that a corner is a hairpin or open. you have to take every corner at slow speed.Alot of other events are 1-3 laps meaning you have no time to learn the circuit at all. TLDR: its not Grid 2. Its bootleg need for speed. If you like the NFS series. enjoy if you wanted a successor to Grid1. youre SOL.			"

												Before buying the game be aware of what Codemasters Customer Services says: ""This version of the game does not officially support Windows 10"" and ""We have no plans for a Windows 10 patch"". The game runs like a charm on my PC, but it crashes to Windows desktop every 3-5 minutes, often in a middle of a race series. I've tried all the guides community post all over the internet on this problem and none of them help. And with no help from tech support, I guess I've just poured my money to drain.			"

												Its a very good game though for me not as good as the Grid One was. I just like more simulation than it's in this part. The grid one gave a choice in multiplayer. This one does not. Anyway, playability is still very good, competition and player development makes it almost imposible to stop playing the effect ""just one more race"" is definitely there, then you become a new car and have to test it and so on. Easy to play, hard to master. And nobody should be angry that it is not an Gran Tourismo or a Forza. Graphics 7/10, Sound 8/10, Gameplay 9/10. Arcade 70% Simulation 30% Gameplay isnt the most important  thing for me but I give it a nine out of 10 score because of the DLC politics.			"

												Well, Codemasters, I have been racing with you since Colin Mcrae Rally 2.0, V8 Supercars 2 and now in the present: coming from F1-2010 to 2013 I felt like a change, and decided over Dirt 3 that I buy Grid 2. First I will start with the cons. -Firstly, NO DRIVERS CAM? What kind of racing game doesn't have that!? Even Colin Mcrae which was a 2000s' era game had it! I get the feeling this isn't a simulation game but more of an arcade. -Secondly yes the realism. The damage model is excellent, smashing into things has never been so fun. But lacks, tire wear and rain? Can't change car setups in career mode unless its hidden? I have looked.-Thirdly Racenet... I am logged in, but I cannot for the life of me, figure out why my times don't show on the friend scoreboard in career mode, I have tried logging out and back in but no cigar. As a competitive racer, I is sad about this.-Lastly the price of the All In DLC is way too expensive for a game which is now dead. By dead I mean, I cannot find a single online race. I won't waste money on unlocking cars I cannot use.OK now for the pros!-Firstly I'm more of a grippy guy so seeing a variety of cars is great! I get such a rush from using the Caterham, it grips so well and it flies. -The graphics are beautiful and at max settings I never dip below 60fps-The career mode. What can I say, an immersive story in which you are a racer working up through the ranks with goodies like unlocking cars  watching the protagonist gain social media attention and fans, The AI provide a challenge even though I have yet to lose a race or even finish second (Hard difficaulty, damage on, flashbacks on)My conclusions is, as a racing fan who always leaned towards Formula One, it was nice to get back to actual road cars. Please remember this is my review, my opinion. I'm sure you think differently and you will let me know in the comments.			"

												Exceptional bad mechanics. Every single car drifts, making it totally unpleasant. The worst part is the abysmal AI of the cars, taking racing lines regardless if you are taking the line and then there is the factor that any car can bump you off track. They bump into your backside and you spin, you bump into their backside and you spin. All in all this is a poor game which I received as a gift and won't spend a penny on.  "

												This is probably one of the best, if not the best, racing games on Steam. Sure, the graphics are maybe a year or two behind, but the game was released in 2013. That being said, I think that it still stands up to newer games like Forza. Every once in a while this game goes on sale for next to nothing. That means that anyone can afford it if they wait for the perfect opportunity. If you want a realistic driving simulator, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a great driving game with an incredibly vast on-line mode and a story mode worth playing, it's all right here. I like it. I think you'll like it.			"

												- DLC bloated. Sometimes, from 10 cars you COULD use, 8 come from DLCs.- Annoying, long, cheesy cut-scene sequences- Drifting worse than GRID (1)- Bad bots are too bad, leading bots are too good. You always start at the end, and you have to mow through all the bad bots, who are simply road block for you. After you've done that, you have to chase down those bots, who HAPPEN to start at the front every single time. Gets pretty annoying after some time.			"

												9/10 -Great sense of speed and collection of cars. The damage system is spectacular and racing your friends is always fun. All the cars handle like a dream. The engines sound like the real thing. The only thing that I was disappointed in was the game doesn't have a cockpit view (inside the car) and you can't upgrade or tune your car in anyway in singleplayer but you can customize your ride like change rims, tire size, colors and decals. Multiplayer on the other hand you can tune your car making it faster. I hate how this game has so much DLC because if you own a certain DLC and your friend doesn't you can't play it with them making that new DLC useless unless you want to play it by yourself. Overall it's the best street racing game I ever played but just short of perfect.			"

												After my favorite racing game of all time called GRID and a long wait,I expected a lot of GRID 2 thinking that this will be another awesome simulation masterpiece,but I thought wrong.GRID 2 is nothing like it's previous part and it didn't achieve my expectation but still,I can not say that this game is not good.GRID 2 is a great racing game on it's own way.True it is arcade gameplay but still very enjoyable one and not that simple as it may seem like.Every car have it's own behaviour,grip,drift or balanced type cars they all have a different feel and most of them are challenging to drive if you are aiming for the limit.Driving get even more exciting knowing that there is no option to turn on stability or traction control,racing line or a breaking point.Your driving depends only on your own knowledge with the cars and tracks.Career mod is good,there are many different cars in a different tiers,a lot of tracks and a lot of different race types you will go through and makes you feel like a real driver.AI is not as strong as on GRID but they do sometimes hit you on a straight line with no reason maybe just to prepare you better for a multiplayer.Speaking of a multiplayer,great thing is that you can have all cars in garage and you are able to upgrade most of them.You even have a option to fully upgrade a car which will then be in a next tier with other stronger cars and making your driving more challenging.Driving clean races is very hard on multiplayer because there are so many different car types in a same tier which requires different racing style and ""I didn't mean to"" is almost unavoidable,so I mostly prefer collisions off settings.Not like on GRID,here you get penalized for cutting the corner but on the other hand,you wont get penalized for so-called ""riding the wall"" thing where you can gain time and make other players angry.Graphics are very good,details of the cars,tracks,places and cityes are awesome.Car damage is ok,physics are not so good.There is this ridiculous thing when you crash on some street track and the car bounces form side to side across the track like a pinball.As a fan of a GRID series,GRID 2 deserves a great 8.5/10 because for me game basicly have only 2 problems, 1.It steps out from first GRID, 2.GRID Autosport was released too soon.

												I played through single player with my Logitech G27 Racing Wheel. I didn't try playing it with a controller, but I do know that this game is designed to be controller friendly.I found this game to give a really fun racing experience without being punishingly difficult or realistic. Unlike games that are designed to be simulations first, it really feels like GRID 2 is designed to be a fun game first.The fun comes from a few things. First of all, the racing does really feel ""intense"" - this comes through thanks to all the great visuals and sounds. It's not easy to describe, but there's just loads of polish on the overall aesthetic. The wide variety of levels and locations really helps here as well.Second of all, they have lots of little ways to prevent you from getting frustrated. My favorite mechanic is the flashback mechanic - it basically lets you rewind time to undo a mistake you made. This is really great because not only does it prevent you from going ""oh no, I need to restart the whole race..."", it also gives you the opportunity to learn much more quickly. There's a limit to how many times you can do this so it doesn't make the game too easy. Furthermore, they have a wide range of difficulty settings for all levels of experience. I have only played a few racing games and found the Easy difficulty to be decently challenging without being frustrating. Finally, they have this guy who is talking to you all the time who will ocassionally offer useful suggestions and keep you focused on what to do during a race (and it doesn't get annoying, in my opinion).Third, the overarching story of trying to get fame for the WSR feels like a pretty significant goal. There's lots of different ways you can advance the story (for example, if you don't like a particular type of event you can focus on other types of events).My major issue with the game is that, towards the fourth WSR series, I felt like the content was becoming a bit same-y and it started to feel like a bit of a grind.Overall, if you are interested in having a fun racing experience as a change from a hardcore, realistic racing sim, this game is pretty fun. I haven't played many other PC games in the genre, though, so take this recommendation with a grain of salt.			"

Product received for free
												GRID 2 is a half-simulator, half arcade style racer that is a genuine balance between both styles of racing genre and can be categorised in a league of its own in terms of car handling and circuit design. Interior view has been removed from the original GRID which is disappointing as I feel that this camera view adds authenticity to a racing game, even if it is rarely used, I would’ve liked to switch views mid-race to know that my driver was steering the car.  The music being added at climatic points in each event adds immersion in the racing experience, unlike games such as Forza or Gran Turismo which have static tracks played all race. This game is a minor step down in drifting compared to GRID 1, however city circuit tracks for regular racing seem to have a realistic transition between brick, asphalt and kerbs unlike the games predecessor.Codemasters has created World Racing League ‘WCR’ were your job is to race a variety of racing clubs from the US, Middle-East, Europe and Asia to attract ‘fans’. The inclusion of ESPN a well-known sport commentating channel in the US adds a layer of mirrored fame found in real life and adds depth in the single player experience, which helps new players to the genre engage in this racing game. The addition of displaying short story clips of your racing fame across YouTube, the WSR in game website and SMS messages motivates you to aim for a greater number of fans. While story typically lacking in racing games, Codemasters has pulled of a story mode that doesn’t ruin the experience of racing or feel that there is any difficulty in progressing to the next race as skipping events is optional. As you near completion of a race, overtaking a threat (another popular driver), complete a race or experience damage issues your crew chief will annoy you which adds to the enjoyment of the game but gets repetitive as you progress through the game. Throughout the game the same tracks, modes and simular challenges were reused however the difficulty of driving a faster vehicle in the later stages of the game compensates for this. Codemasters could pull some of the officially licenced world class circuits from the F1 series into Grid 2.In short the singleplayer provides a decent range of content despite the large amount of additional content and will give at least 24 hours of gameplay in the base game*, additional tracks including the extravagant demolition derby has been brought from GRID 1 in a free DLC which is brilliant for local multiplayer fun with friends and family. The demolition derby features only one car to choose from that is kitted out just for demolition events which you can select in the quick race menu for single or multiplayer modes. It was disappointing that Grid 2 features the same tracks as its predecessor, which feels like Codemasters reworked the handling of the vehicle in this mode to be significantly easier to control, making it harder to slide out. *Please do note that I have played this game for console on release week. *In GRID 2 online unlike the ‘WRS’ singleplayer mode you can purchase and upgrade vehicles performance. The new rivalry mode allows users to set up randomly assigned online players which compete for XP to crown the ‘better racer’, this mode I feel is underused at the time of writing this review but is a great feature that I believe GRID should integrate with the main multiplayer mode of future titles. There is also a global challenge that ranks your account on various tracks against world times and a full featured online mode which has typical lobby matchmaking as you would expect. With some interesting indicators for racers which prefer to drive aggressively indicated by traffic light colour exclamation marks next to their profiles. Also by purchasing the DLC you get no advantage over users who have not purchased the DLC other than the specific vehicle, and all tiers are able to be used from the start in multiplayer however if you want more cars they need to be purchased unlike the singleplayer. Grid 2 is a graphically enhanced GRID 1 with several race types such as checkpoint, time attack, endurance, face off, drift, touge, races that change each lap and regular races found in the single payer as well as the multiplayer. GRID 2 is a well-priced game to buy standalone during a sale event, do not be pressured to purchase the DLC’s on offer for this title as the content is not worth what you pay for. The free DLC of demolition derby is to be expected as it features the same tracks and cars from the previous title, but I found that the gameplay was more enjoyable for the demolition derby races than in the original GRID. The lack of cockpit view is a major letdown and detracts the simulation aspect found in the previous title. Both GRID 1 and 2 are great games and if you prefer a more Arcady family and friend gaming experience than GRID 2 is the game of choice out of the two which is an easy game to get into for beginners. Overall GRID 2 is a brilliant game that can be set apart from the previous title in ways, however there has been key gameplay features removed and missed from the original game.*Please do note that I have received this game for the purpose of reviewing it*			"

												This game is not really an improvement over Race Driver: GRID, except for the graphics. This game has a number of defects including:- No cockpit view (apparently because of ""memory constraints"". Really? This is a PC game, right?)- A high chance of having zero multiplayer which still hasn't been fixed after 8 months- Cheaters in multiplayer if you are lucky enough to have it- DLC is pretty bad, seemingly just content ripped from release so you can pay extra- DLC shown during any car select so it feels like you're playing a demoThe physics are er, ...interesting. It's very drift friendly - perhaps for the younger generation - and sometimes I like this and sometimes it seems my car breaks into a slide purely at random.Singleplayer - Seems to be 90% city courses so far (I'm most of the way through tier 3) with only the occasional time trial on decent real world circuits, which might be quite a disappointment for Race Driver: GRID fans. The much hated Codemasters D0uchebag™ is alive and present in singleplayer, sounding like an absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ idiot blabbering on about social media ... I want to punch that fool. Fortunately you can tun him off which is a massive improvement over Dirt 3, where you are forced to listen to the fūckwit tell you to ""upload your video to youtube!!11!1!!"". Only things it's got going for itself is the graphics and the damage modelling. If you're looking for a sequel to GRID I suggest you look at Shift 2 Unleashed, even for all it's problems it's far superior to this.			"

												A big disappointment, particularly compared to the first GRID.  While the UI and the conceit are cool, the game is disgustingly crammed with DLC. How disgusting? The cars that ""count"" as DLC are DIFFERENT between the single player and online versions of the game.  Also, it doesn't work with my racing wheel (a Microsoft Sidewinder Pro) which did work with the original game. Playing it with a Xbox gamepad just isn't the same.On a possitive note, the racing *feels* very fast, and the maps are good, particularly the country road ones. So if you value feeling fast over anything else, this might be the racing game for you.			"

												It's a solid game, with beautiful graphics, scenery and the sound effects are very good, but it feels mainly ""arcadeish"", good for people bad in driving games (myself included). The game however has settings that add more manual handling control to the user, but the gameplay itself lacks realism. The game main campaign might look interesting for the first few races, but then it gets too repetitive,  every time it's the same venues, the tracks are just slightly different from one another when racing in the same place or are exactly the same you played on before, very poor variablility. Also, some events are ultra repetitive as you have to run in the same track over and over, and do not add anything different to the gameplay.The multiplayer part of the game is fun at first, but levelling up was taking a lot of time and made me lose interest on keeping racing on every same track all the time. Also finding a lobby with a lot of people is not an easy task, maybe this can vary with the region of the world. The good part about the multiplayer is playing with friends and laughing about the mistakes and crashes.One thing very annoying is shoving in your face the ""add-on"" cars (DLC) when you go to select your car to play. Add-on cards should only be shown if I had the cars, not telling me to purchase them. If you want to advertise it in the game, make it so in the main menu... By the way, they added a ""Reloaded"" edition, which is just the same base game with all the DLC included in a single package, another way to milk more money out of DLC.--------Portuguese translation:O jogo é bem feito, tem belos gráficos, cenários e efeitos sonoros são muito bons, mas o jogo é muito arcade, bom para o público geral que não joga bem jogos de corrida (eu incluso nisso). Porém o jogo permite configurações que permitem maior controle manual por parte do jogador, mas mesmo assim o jogo não prima em realismo. A campanha principal do jogo é interessante no início, principalmente nas primeiras corridas, mas daí em diante se torna repetitivo demais, são sempre nas mesmas cidades, os circuitos mudam muito pouco mesmo quando o modo de corrida muda, muitas vezes são os mesmos circuitos/traçados, a variedade é bem fraca. Os eventos em si também são bem repetitivos, muitas vezes você tem que correr na mesma pista várias vezes, e nada de diferente é adicionado à jogabilidade.O modo multiplayer é início no começo, mas subir de level parece muito lento e me fez perder o interesse em jogar online nos mesmos circuitos de novo toda hora. Encontrar uma sala com muita gente também não é tarefa muito fácil, de repente falta jogador se for dividido por região. O legal do multiplayer é jogar com amigos e rir dos erros e batidas.Uma coisa bem chata é ficar mostrando toda hora os carros ""add-on"" (DLC) quando você vai selecionar o seu carro pra corrida. Esses carros opcionais só deveriam ser mostrados caso o usuário tivesse a DLC, não ficar toda hora mostrando que pode comprar, é irritante. Se quer fazer propaganda faça no menu inicial... A propósito, eles lançaram uma versão ""Reloaded"" que nada mais é do que o mesmo jogo com todas as DLCs inclusas num pacote, outra forma incentivar a prática caça-níquel de DLCs.			"

													Grid 2 is yet another racing game from arcade racing specialists Codemasters and make no mistake, this is no simulation.  Racing is centred around street circuits, permanent racing venues and a few single stage like events. 	There is a wide variety of events available from straight races, time trials, checkpoint races, endurance (7 whole minutes at a time!), drift, eliminator and others.  The best of these is the “liveroutes” events that occur in one of the major cities.  The route is randomly chosen when you start a race and the mini-map is disabled resulting in you having to pay attention to the upcoming corner to judge entry speed.  Though once you have been playing the single player portion of the game for a while it does become easier as the locations while appearing huge are quite limited in how many layouts are available.	The game is absolutely beautiful though, from the various locations like Paris, Hong Kong and Barcelona to all the car models and how damage appears on them.  The game also performs admirably on even modest machines.My biggest issue with the game is how the cars drive and more importantly how the AI cars drive.  Cars come in two varieties, tail happy and not, that's about it.  Front wheel drive cars drive like front wheel drive cars, four wheel drive cars are glued to the road and for rear wheel drive it's seemingly random whether it's glued to the road or wants to head for the bushes at every corner.  This behaviour tends to drive you to only driving a couple of cars like the Caterham LMP-like track car the Audi R8 LMS.The opposition AI is also an issue.  Instead of allowing the AI to drive the track and react to conditions and you as they appear, the AI cars seem to be pre-programmed to move around the track in a certain way like robots.  It's frustrating in many ways as you end up making the same passes all the time as you quickly become aware of their weaknesses.  There are also some bizarre changes in difficulty, some races are ridiculously easy on the highest setting while others are quite hard on the lowest.  Both these criticisms could be made of just about every Codemasters racing game, maybe with the next Dirt or Grid they could concentrate on AI?All in all this is a very decent Arcade racer, it doesn't do anything new or exciting that is deserving of paying full price, but is a good way or wasting a few hours here and there.

												Game is not worth it. Anything made good in this game is lost by the fact that every AI car in the game are on rails that are harder to break than Wolverine's Bones. You can not race against them without constant annoyance. They will push and shove you out of their way like your car is made out of paper cups and they are titanium. That is on any difficulty. I would recommend Dirt3 but that is a no go as well, as it can not save. It is a dark day for driving games, a dark day indeed.			"

												An arcade racing game. Great damage simulation. Yet another racing game tells you that drift is way better than grip.娱乐爽快的赛车游戏，里面的车损系统一直是我喜欢grid系列的原因之一。游戏里面漂移比抓地过弯快，所以必须得漂移╮(╯_╰)╭......			"

												Although, It really is ALOT of fun to play, The truth of the matter is, the game have major flaws....The game saves becoming corrupted, I believe that was done by CM on purpose, just to sell the unlock pack to all the frustrated racers who would have to race with none of the cool unlocked cars. Then they ""fixed"" it.  So now, my gamesave file is corrupt again, and there is no way to fix it. Well, the 68.00 + tx  I spent on this game thus far, seems to be wasted money..DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. When I complained on a thread made by one of the developers re: VAC being intigrated into GRID 2, I fired of a comment""Are you going to corrupt our gamesaves, and sell us VAC like u did with the UNLOCK PACK.?""Now, before I posted, comments were coming in at around, 1 per 4 to 5 hours. 10 mins after I posted, 15 comments in 10 minutes, and NOT 1 had anything to do with my comment. The next morning. Codemasters deleted the tread, and moved all feedback to the forums, so they can instantly edit out comments that they dont like. And I know this sounds paranoid, But my gamesave didnt corrupt for the 2nd time, until I posted a VERY similar comment on a steam freinds profile.I am openly and publicly calling CODEMASTERS out.YOU SCAMMED US, AND YOU KNOW IT!!!!!!!!!-the worst part is. I really liked that game. Id recommend D/L a torrent, You wont have multiplayer, but with the gamesave issue, your only saving yourself the heart ache of losing all your work, and just when it get good, the game save corrupts...

												In my opinion, the game is worth it if it's under $20.  I've been a active racer for this game since day one.  I've preordered it on Steam because it had the best DLC bundle compared to the console counterparts.  The only DLC packs that matter are the mclaren pack, the mercedes pack, and the gt-r pack in my opinion.  Since there were a lot of folks that pre-ordered it too, you'll be able to use those cars on a regular basis in the public lobbies.  Both the Mclaren and Mercedes DLC cars for TIER 4 are the ONLY upgradeable ones.  You can not upgrade any other DLC cars.  Also, the GT-R pack is good because it gives you a good option to be competative in Tier 3 when you are starting out as a low level driver.As far as multiplayer goes, just make sure you set your download region to a European server (since the game is region-locked).  If you are looking forward to drift mode like the one from GRID 1, then be prepared to be let down.  Because of the new physics engine, it's nothing like it's predecessor.  But I like the racing portion a lot though.  The reason why I liked the GRID 1 was because all the cars had the SAME SPECS.  So the only thing that defines the winner is skill and the racing lines the driver takes to get to the top.  With the upgrade customization aspect thrown into the mix in GRID 2,  it's now about which setup get's you the best performance in the car along with what lines you take.  As you meet faster racers, you'll learn what are the best setups for the best car in each tier or, for me, the best setup for your driving style.  Add in the ""active obstactle"" for the mental game of how are you going to pass this racer cleanly for an extra challenge.  Also, if you are pretty confident in your skills and are in a room full of noobs, you can challenge yourself by giving the noobs a 10 second head start.

												Want a good racing game? Get original GRID, want a game you won't be able to complete unless you buy all dlc, get this! It's easier than original was, and yet it feels harder, almost all cars you get trough career are drifters (even the ones that really shouldn't be) So you will have a really hard time finishing some races without buying a good dlc pack :(			"

												I have not played a lot of racing games on pc, but I can say Grid 2 is one of the best I have tried. I hear a lot of complaints about it being not realistic enough, but for me that's just fine (after all my favorite racing series is the F Zero series). I have not played its predecessor but I can say that I do enjoy Grid 2 quite a bit. I am having trouble putting into words what I like about Grid 2, after all I cant even describe what sets it apart from other racing games. I can say however, that I have not noticed anything ""wrong"" with the game per se. It ran good for me, it was easy to learn, and it was fun to play, and in the end, are those not the most important aspects of a game? I cant tell you why you should be interested in Grid 2, but if you are a fan, you've got to at least give it a look. I cant guarantee you wont be disappointed. But you will never know until you try.			"

												One of the best racing games I have ever played!Really nice gameplay, cars, controls, graphics. Also runs amazing on laptop chips :)The story mode is great and the multiplayer is fun too, the only dowside can be the car styling but its not a big deal.You should really consider geting this if you are a fan of racing games but also if you like games with ""speed"", like going really fast. It really feels like you are in the car in this game and to be honest it feels great!This game is also very realistic on the crashes, it really looks like a real car that has been damaged.Is ths game worth buying at full price? Yes it is!Will it run on a older pc? Yeah it will, actually runned at medium/high settings on my laptop.1-10? 9/10 :)			"

Grabbed a copy of Grid 2 Reloaded to check out some fantastic racing fun. $19.25 tax in with a bunch of DLC so I figured I couldn't go wrong.It might not be the latest and greatest graphics, but I think it's a solid racer you can spend a few hrs messing around in it and having some fun. I am enjoying the career mode so far.7.8/10

												Don't get me wrong, this game had potential but just has some major issues that make it almost unplayable.- HandingThe cars handle like complete crap and are either boaty as♥♥♥♥♥♥or so sensative you can't drive in a straight line. The cars spin so freaking easily and its impossible to overcome a spin or control it. If you so much as touch someone, you spin, if you touch a wall you spin, if you do anything you spin. Trying to drift is nearly impossible, as soon as you start to slide, it's like a bar of soap sliding on the bottom of a wet bath tub. Honestly phone racing games have better handling this. 3/10- PerformanceI don't know if this is my own fault, or what but after playing the game for 10 hours the performance decided to jump off a cliff and I know it's not me playing on a weak PC, I play Shift 2 above 60 fps no issue at all on max. If it wasn't for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ performance, the graphics would be really good. 4/10- DifficultyI don't want to play a game that is so easy you dust everyone, but damn its nearly impossible to win even if the game didn't have the ♥♥♥♥♥iest handling ever. If all of the AI have the same car as you, they are still way faster in all ways despite them owning the EXACT same car as you. It makes winning more of a hassle than fun, you end up restarting the event over and over again until either you wreck one of the AI or they do something stupid and you get extremly lucky. 2/10If you want a nice looking track racing game, just get Shift 2, it's a lot better and cheaper, you even get all the DLCs for free.

												This game has fantastic graphics even on a laptop with very average specs. I like almost everything about it, except the handling. It's a huge drift fest. The developers decided that drifting around corners going 180 km/h is a good idea. I've played other racing games before, but simply had no luck with this one because the cornering physics is so different. I could train myself to handle the cars this way, but I don't want to change my habits for just one game.Mind you, this IS an ARCADE STYLE racing game. I shouldn't have been expecting realism. If you like more realistic handling (i.e. actually braking before cornering), try Grid Autosport. I bought this game with all the DLC, wish I could get all the money back but it's too late. I really want to like this game, and I had some good times with it in the beginning, but soon I realised that it's not meant for me.			"

												Bought on sale after loving GRID I was hoping for something good but came away disappointed. The cars and graphics are nice enough. Now on the bad bits. The menu system is akward and ends up intrusive to the game overall, instead of letting you get the best of it. That could be lived with if it was not for the biggest issue this game has. It lacks the visceral experience of a RACE compared to the original. This is down to cars feeling unpredictable/non linear in their behaviour. During gameplay there is an unmistakable feeling of driving aids being too overpowering. They don't make the game fun by taking care of a the odd blunder, they smother it sadly. All of the above was evident from the first few minutes of gameplay, I persevered for the sake of the game for 6 hours of total gameplay. In the end I am sad to say this is a game you should 100% avoid if you want a fun and thrilling racing experience. This is not on a sim or arcade spectrum. The core gameplay just does not work here... The original GRID left me thrilled, this just furstrated			"

												I wouldn't recommend this game to any one after finishing the career mode.So this is the 2nd of the GRID series. It has better music and better graphics. A race in Algave on a sunny day is really beautiful. A richer car list than GRID, including those breathtaking racing cars and those flashing super or hyper car. The idea of WSR is also great, getting drivers from all over the world, from different clubs, having different driving style to race rogether is great fun.But seriously, because you're the post boy of WSR, and your job is to attract those racers to take part in WSR, you'll have no chance to take part in 24h Le Mans. And for this you're saying goodbye to those stunning prototypes, which is a great lost for me. Well they left me a SP300R though.So since I won't recommend this game to anyone else, how imperfect it is? Well, the career mode, I'd devide it into three parts, the boring part I like a game of NFS, the best second part and the total nightmare of the third part. Why is that? The cars in this game are divided in to three types: grip, balanced and drift. Sounds reasonable, right? But the problem is, GRID2 didn't have a right idea of drfting, and made drfting literally spinning. It's alright at first, when your cars are always slow so you can remain in control. But that makes it feel like NFS. When you're going into Europe, grip type of cars appear. You'll find them funny to drive, with sometimes a little bit of slide, you'll have a lot of fun in driving. But when it comes to the later part of the game, especially when you have those Tier 4 super car. The spin on those super car becomes uncontrollable, so when you are racing in HongKong or Co d'Azure, you'll have to go carefully (and slowly) to avoid spinning and crashing. And even worse, only one of the super cars is grip type. The problem is caused by the poor physics of this game, like everyone else said.And then, BOTs. Thanks to spinning, the Koenisegg Agera R is literally undrivable. But, you'll find out those BOTs will drive this car like a gust of wind, no crashing, no spinning and don't even slide! And like GRID, BOTs of GRID2 like crashing too. That Bruno Silva guy, before the race the radio will tell you he's so agressive and always crashing others, so he hit me, well, I can't blame anyone because they warned me the guy was dangerous. But when they tell me Eliminaciόn drivers are afraid of trade paint, those guys still crashed on me. My face was like ""dafaq"" as I was spinning. So since those BOTs made you so upset, why not spin them out or crash them out of track to take some revenge? No, you won't move them a little bit. If they crash you, you'll spin, and if you crash them, you'll spin too! And in two racing type the BOTs made themselves boss there. One of them is touge. In touge competitor will take penalty for hitting other driver. But in GRID2 it's directly disqualified. And here is the problem. If you crash them, you'll get disqualified, that's the rule. But if they crash you, you're still getting disqualified. Simple. The other one is drifting race. Drifting race is literally a series of jokes in GRID2. Just get behind one of your competitor and see how they drive and you'll find out that it's no even sliding, just driving fast through every corner like a normal race. And when you get to the finish you'll find out that they still have a decent score for that. Drifting itself is a joke in GRID2, drifting race is a series of jokes.In career mode you can test drive your cars. But it's only one lap only in Indianpolis. So in real life it's reasonable because those race track will charge you for using their tracks. If you don't have much money you won't be able to go like 10 laps on the track. But come on! If you can't drive those racing car on the race track freely, why are you still playing it? Are we playing a race manager simulator rather than a  race driver simulator, if it ever is?And, well, no Nürburgring, even worse.5/10, for the middle part of the career mode is a lot fun.			"

												A game with a splendid visual work. As well for tracks, cities, landscapes or cars, although the choice of Japanese and American is excessive. Here, neither Porsche, Ferrari, nor Lamborghini, etc. (And Audi, Zenvo, Jaguar, Volvo or other AMG against which you run in WSR, are not available in DLC) But the principal critic to do to this game, it's that instead of being called “GRID 2”, it should be called “DRIFT 2” so much ALL the cars drift, in spite of medium settings. Some are almost impossible to handle, like Ford Sierra 500, Pagani Zonda Revolucion, McLaren MP4-12C, Honda NSX-R or Koenigsegg CCGT. Even the Dallara Indy with its slick tires drifts ! What is incredible for Racing Cars which should remain like on rails ! But at the opposite, others cars are totally understeer like the three types of Nissan GTR, the Ford UTE or the brilliant Subaru Tomei Cusco Impreza. (With these cars, take care to the size choice of your rims !) And let's not speak about the non-existent braking of almost all the cars except this little fabulous Subaru Impreza, the ridiculous engine sound of some, or the too low top speed of others. Only 223 MpH for the CCGT and 214 for the Dallara : a bad surprise, because normaly these cars exceed 250 MpH ! And for the “OnLine Races"", better is to forget. It's Stock-Car between furious insane, not of the Automobile race...Un jeu avec un travail visuel magnifique, que ce soit pour les voitures, les circuits, les villes ou les paysages, bien que le choix des Japonaises et Américaines soit excessif. Ici, ni Porsche, ni Ferrari, ni Lamborghini, etc. (Et les Audi, Zenvo, Jaguar, Volvo et autres AMG contre lesquelles on court en WSR, ne sont pas disponibles en DLC) Mais le principal reproche que je ferais à ce jeu, c'est qu'au lieu de s'appeller ""Grid 2"", il devrait s'appeller ""Drift 2"" tellement  TOUTES les voitures dérapent malgré des réglages medium. Certaines sont quasiment inconduisibles, comme la Ford Sierra 500, la Pagani Zonda Revolucion, la McLaren MP4-12C, la Honda NSX-R ou la Koenigsegg CCGT. Même la Dallara Indy avec ses pneus slicks, dérape ! Ce qui est un comble pour des Voitures de Course qui devraient rester sur des rails ! Mais à l'opposé, d'autres voitures sont totalement sous-vireuses comme les trois types de Nissan GTR, la Ford UTE ou la géniale Subaru Tomei Cusco Impreza. (Avec ces bagnoles, faites gaffe au choix de la taille de vos jantes !) Et ne parlons pas du freinage inexistant de presque toutes les voitures excepté de cette fabuleuse petite Subaru Impreza, du ridicule son-moteur de certaines, ou de la trop basse vitesse de pointe d'autres. Seulement 360 KmH pour la CCGT et 345 pour la Dallara : une mauvaise surprise, parce que normalement ces voitures dépassent les 400 KmH ! Quant aux ""courses en Ligne"", mieux vaut oublier. C'est du Stock-Car entre fous furieux, pas de la Course Automobile...			"

												Overall a good game, but there a some points that are incredibly annyoing after a while. The Handling is everything but realistic. You always start at the back, that mean you have to overtake the slow KI which is constantly blocking you on small tracks. The KI in first place wins distance in this time and its just luck when you have enough time in the last lap to overtake him. Then if you touch another Car, yours instantly loses control and you have to shift back. If another car touches you the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing happens. Feels like that their cars weight like 3tons and yours 200kg.			"

I did and, besides the lower quality graphics, the overall experience is way better, a lot closer to one of my favorite racing games: Shift Unleashed.So, if you empathize with this review, you should try GRID, being advised it's a little outdated, but still fun.

												You think that you play Grid, but people think that they play Burnout! Instead of going faster, and turning smoother; majority of people on multiplayer prefer to hit you in the back and make you go full 360. The sad part is that there is no way to punish these players in-game! They ruin your Grid experience, and gain advantage of that! Codemasters does not do anything about it, the game does not have publisher support. Singleplayer is fun though, but multiplayer is nothing more than rage control.			"

												Grid 2 is a racing game that rewards skill without punishing you for the tiniest mistakes, letting you master a simple system with a forgiving attitude. It may stray too close towards the easy side of the scale at times, and it'll be interesting to see how the game works online (which unfortunately wasn't tested in this review), but its career mode is well worth playing and you won't be satisfied until you've mastered every single corner.

												GRID 2 is the successor of the great GRID, one of the first titles of the genre to popularize in the current generation of consoles. The game franchise's debut game impressed by presenting cutting-edge graphics and good gameplay. The most highlighted in the title was the amazing effect of speed that the game offered players. Upon reaching certain levels of speeds, the vehicle presented light bumps and a beginning of a lack of control in every wrong move could result in a spectacular collision.In this way, the Codemasters started to become a reference in the genre, which eventually finalized with the release of titles like DiRT 3 and the official Formula 1 games. The downside of all this is that before games so well accepted by critics and by the players, GRID 2 hits the market with a greater good than other games of the producer.Fortunately, the company has done the homework and, on top of a new engine, brought practically the same game with minor improvements. What makes the game a must-have for fans of the genre, even in the final stretch of this generation of consoles.Grid 2 offers a lot of speed and game modesFetching the popularizing of your eventGRID 2 focuses on the evolution of the pilot in a competition, the WSR, which seeks to become a known event. For this, it is necessary to popularize the attraction, attracting more fans with incredible feats, how to win duels and disputadíssimas evidence. Every amount reached by public, create more evidence and the event gets even more prominence, even with calls on television shows. Of course it's a joke of a partnership between the company and an American sports channel.And just as in the first game, you must also fulfill objectives imposed by sponsors, ranging from finished the race in a given place, to perform feats within a race, how to overcome a certain number of opponents. Fulfilling these goals, more evidence and vehicles are released.Incredible variety of game modesGRID 2 has an amazing range of modalities that are part of both the main mode, when descompromissadas evidence. They are:Race common race mode where WINS who arrives in frontAgainst the clock race against the clock where you need to score the best time of the trackPopular Drift mode skid, where every you need slippage accumulates point. Add WINSElimination Proof in that every 20 seconds, the last placed is eliminatedOverdrive Exceed the maximum of opponents, without colisòes, to score pointsTougue Wins who open more than 5 second advantage over his opponent firstConfrontation Duels against an opponent where WINS who arrives in frontControl point Run to achieve the maximum possible checpoints and add a few seconds to your time. WINS who spend more time on the track.Resistance test with a particular overtime. WINS who is at first when this time finishEven so, none of them have so much prominence when the mode in which the path becomes totally random. That is, the player doesn't have a map and the straights and curves appear in a way unexpected. This requires a cautious and riding at the same time a lot of reflection.Pilotage in that you dictate the paceThe GRID 2 gameplay remains the high point of the game. Despite not running at 60 frames per second, it features movements which depict very well the realism of disputes at high speed, with a great progression of difficulty. In other words, while at the beginning of your journey, the cars, the tracks and the opponents are not terrifying, as the progress of the game, his skill is increasingly required, both to stay on the right path, how to get in front.Another interesting point of the game is the player's freedom to fly in their strokes. There are all kinds of curves for various vehicles, in this way, it is up to the player to opt for boldness or by doing the basics. That is, every moment you can decide by simply attacking a curve, requiring the maximum of brakes and tires, or just get around it the safest way possible-of course there are exceptions to everything, and some curves require much more accurate movements.The greatest proof of this freedom is the absence of the already popular auxiliary line. Virtually all racing games released in this generation include the famous coloured line showing the ideal stroke. With his absence in GRID 2, back to the old and traditional custom of get to know better the path before to master certain clues. But if the player still find some difficulty-or making a big error-replay mode, which remains intact, can be activated. It allows players to go back up to a certain point of the race, and can change their past movements.Visually, GRID 2 is even more beautiful			"

												Absolute ♥♥♥♥ing garbage. I can't even believe the♥♥♥♥♥♥that Codemasters is trying to pull by having made this game. This is literally a downgrade from Grid 1. I'm ♥♥♥♥ing stunned that this is even a game. Pros:looks niceCons:.Driving physics are stripped down and completely different resulting in a straight downgrade from the first game      .the handling is too sensitive. you drift simply by turning hard enough and the game has nothing but hairpin turns      .You HAVE to use the brake instead of the E-brake to drift.drifting is god awful.Simplified hud.default controller layout is changed for no reason and is worse. .Blatant advertising.dated references     .Seriously the first achievement you get is a reference to a 3-year old pop song. It's only going to get more dated as time goes on. .linear story mode     .Some♥♥♥♥♥♥is constantly yammering in my ear and attempting to stroke my ego while simultaneously screaming about     some stupid competition that I care nothing about and then proceeds to explain it to me like I've never played a racing game or watched a racing movie. .announcer/coach that holds your hand and patronizes you every step of the way no matter how bad you mess up.Forced account signup for some stupid network you're never gonna use.no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cockpit view.NO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ RACE DAY MODE     This is probably the worst part about the game. I could handle all of the above. Even the inferior handling but when you can't even stop the campaign to enjoy some laps by yourself and trying out new cars then it's not even worth playing. I don't know of any racing game and I sure as hell don't know any racing sims that doens't have a test track mode. -3/10. I paid next to nothing for this game and I still regret it.			"

												One of the most disappointing racing games for me. The first GRID was incredible and had a more semi-sim feeling to it where as GRID 2 is 100% arcade, something that is very unlike what Codemasters have been doing since the first Race Driver. The sponsors function has been changed completely, very dumbed down. And the absence of a decent monetary system is very disappointing. There's nothing left of what made the first GRID great.Thanks Codemasters for ruining a great game.			"

												I'm a pretty huge fan of racing games in general, and to be honest, I've played most of them too, whether it be forza, dirt, gran turismo, test drive, need for speed... you get the point. This game is truely up there with the rest. Codemasters have made yet another awesome title, however I can't stop thinking its Dirt on asphalt, the driving mechanics are very similar to Dirt, however they are very different to that of other racing games. To be honest, i'm not complaining tho, the driving is much smoother than most racing games and can become quite enjoyable after a while.GRID 2 provides an awesome variety of maps and enviroments from places in USA, Europe and Asia. Not to mention the cars, there is more than enough to choose from for each season and the difficulties are neither too hard, too easy... but just right, compared to that of Dirt 3 (way too easy).Although it may not have the open world gameplay of test drive unlimited, or the graphics in forza and it is hardly an improvement multiplayer, but with aggressive AI and enjoyable handling, Codemasters ensure that this game is always challeging, and there is more than enough hours of fun packed within this game.

												I really wish there was a better rating system on Steam than just yes or no.. i would give this game a 5/10.The CONS just out-weigh the PROS for me. That being said its still an enjoyable fun game.PROS:>Very polished, optimized game. would probably run on a laptop on medium-ish settings and still look great!>Beautiful Graphics, Seriously better than the first GRID's graphics and even those were really good in 07.>Fantastic Damage model for all cars! this could almost pass for ""Soft body Physics"".CONS:>Boring compared to the first one, seriously gets boring when you travel to Europe.>crappy car list compared to the first game, a lot of missing car classes (no Open-wheel, DTM, GT, LMP and no Le Mans). it starts out like the first one and i was excited. I won muscle car after muscle car, then when you travel to Europe you get crappy Econo-box  tier cars i wouldn't be seen dead in like: Subaru BRZ, Ford Focus ST, Alfa Romeo Giulietta and a freaking Hyundai Genesis!!! a Hyundai!!! why?? all that Econo-box list is missing is a Kia Soul!! The only exciting cars you will get in Europe is the Volkswagen Golf R, or the few BMWs you get.... >they want you to buy the better cars in various over priced DLC packs...>CRAPPY HANDLING PHYSICS. Okay, this one is my biggest complaint over this game since this was FINE in the first GRID, and also what made me give it a ""Not Recommended"" rating. They made it so that you may as well drift around every corner, its the fastest way to get around any corner! don't get me wrong, i love drifting, but this is advertised as a racing sim. NOT EVERY CAR SHOULD SLIDE AROUND A CORNER LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF INITIAL D AT THE SLIGHTEST TAP OF THE BREAK CODEMASTERS! No lie, you can seriously fly around a corner faster than any competition by just tapping the E-break, even in ""grip"" or ""balanced"" type cars. Its more of a challenge to race properly and grip the road, this is just silly...For me GRID 2 is a bit of a let down since the first one, and also i grew up playing Codemaster's games like Colin McRae. I still enjoy playing it in small bursts. The CONS just out-weigh the PROS for me to be able to fairly give it a ""Recommended"", i wish i could give it a ""Its Ok"" rating,			"

												As an arcade racer sure, it is decent and can be fun. However I was hoping for something closer to NFS Shift 2, a game that has the heart of a Sim racer with a bit more accessibility. The driving feels very drifty and exaggerated and is easier to manage with a gamepad controller then it is with a racing wheel. The biggest gripe I have is the omission on the cockpit view, it makes me just not want to play the game at all. My second biggest Gripe is the way DLC is handled. The game feels more like a F2P pay2win game where all the best parts are behind a pay wall. The base game comes with enough to get by but why do I need to pay more to race with my favorite car or on my favorite track. It is just a shame.			"

The game is linear and you have no choice where to race. The roads are lined with walls and hitting them seem to be integrated into the game.

												Grid 2 is a game which tries too many different things and does most of them poorly. The biggest disappointment here for most Codies fans will be the driving physics, which are laughable. When you realise drifing round a corner is faster than braking and clipping the apex, the game immediately loses any shine.It looks good enough, but the huge amount of street courses versus the comparatively few road courses and the shonky driving model make for a pretty bland experience. Little bugs here and there once again dent the presentation, which - like DiRT - gets caught up in big name sponsors instead of focusing on the driving itself.A lack of a cockpit view is the final nail in the coffin for Grid 2. Very disappointing experience.			"

I mean come on! you crash on them with 270km, you get tossed like <3 <3 <3 <3 and they are just keep going like nothing happened AND NO DAMAGES? really? The maps .. All the same, no matter what mode you play. 5-6 areas with a biiiiiiiit modified tracks.The ""freezing"" because of enviromental lightning.. Doesn't matter how high or low you have your graphics. Doesn't matter if it's Intel or AMD. IT WILL FREEZE for a few miliseconds that will propably ruin your race especialy online.The car handling. The whole thing was bad. where are those awesome ORIGINAL GRID settings for realistic driving? They don't even have the HEAD VIEW option.Now for the online mode.This was the worst. The menus.. You have to click in damn LOT choices to just enter an event.. You need to exit a party to change car settings or get new unlocks or upgrade cars -means you will lose that party, take it's sweet time to find new-. The car menu was poorly designed.. To upgrade cars you kept needed to move up and down on riddiculus selections, to swich between cars you need to do all over menu browse from start.. ReALLY?Second most stupid thing online.. CHEATERS .. yep just like dirt or f1 we have a lots of those here .. nothing more to say. And ofcourse that there is no penalty for those who are just playing to crash on you so their ""pals"" can get the flag. THIS IS NO <3<3<3ING DIRT!My opinion, get GRID 1 if you want a really good racing game.. with a LOT of tracks and cars again, with NO need for stupid upgrates.. Just get money and buy cars.. Just no online games there. lan and splitscreen are still available.			"

												Truth be told, it isn't the best when it comes to the amount of content featured: 50 ish cars and less than 20 tracks, not including the layouts, as well as stupidly overpriced DLC just for (mostly) modified versions of existing cars.It also handles almost nothing like the original Race Driver: GRID. Any car can drift, even Grippy-type ones, with some handbrake persuasion. About the only thing that's improved instead of replaced is the damage modelling. Frankly, Codemasters should've renamed the game if the only thing keeping it in touch with the original GRID is the premise of tackling multiple motorsport disciplines, from straight up races to touges.Visually, there's no denying it; GRID 2 looks beautiful, and for once I accept the large amounts of lens flare and lens grime, only because there is no true Dashboard Camera. This game really doesn't need it anyway.Sound design is also amazingly well done. It's quite rare to see a racing game do the Skyline R34 engine and exhaust sounds as close to the real thing as it gets, and then there's the tunnels and terrain echoing.Career mode offers varied racing disciplines, and the multiplayer is very solid, but it all depends on your ability to look past the changed features, little content and LACK OF COCKPIT VIEW *grrrr* for an otherwise pure racing experience.

												For someone like me, (who loves Codemasters' games as well as the orginal GRID) the standard version of GRID 2 is dissapointing and deviates from what made the original game so good. I really want to praise the fantastic visuals, incredible sound design, with impressive roster of cars and a decent online multiplayer, but there are some glaring problems. I could go on about the horrible americanised story, which is tedious and dull. I could do a rant on the 'Truefeel' handling system that robs the car's identity when driving and I could rage about the omission of the cockpit view, but these aren't the true reasons why, I just can't in good faith, give this game the recommended verdict.   The actual reasoning is it's DLC, which is FAR too overpriced. At £25 for all the DLC you get the following:- 5 Tracks (15 routes). - 24 Cars (2 liveries).- A 15% discount on every in-game purchase in online multiplayer.- Instant access to every online car.(This doesn't include the free demoliton derby game mode)That may seem much, but as the game is £20, it's far less value, while creating a massive player disconnect in the multiplayer.Overall if you like GRID stay the hell away from this, and wait for GRID Autosport. This is too much of a cash grab that tarnishes the GRID name. 5/10   "

TL/DR REVIEW: MediocreGRID 2 is a very arcady racer. Multiplayer is dead, singleplayer is not that great in my opinion. I guess the events and fan system is kind of cool, but the actual racing with AI in this game is not good in my opinion. The game bored me quickly. If you just want a simple, casual arcady (no problem with that) racing game with decent graphics, this might be for you. But for me it's just very mediocre.Final noteThis is not an in depth or complete review of the game. It simply sums up my experience with the game in an effort to help you make a more informed purchasing decision. "

It's not that bad to give up playing it, still, you can have a bit of fun playing online with your friend.Not a proper sequel, absolutley.The Grid series was a good arcade-simulator series, getting pretty close to being a simulator (Not comparing to Gran Turismo, because it's a true simulator and Grid is not near that, but pretty close). Race Driver: Grid was a pretty neat racing game, that was all about motorsport and very realsitic physics. But then cames out the second one and gives motorsport a middle finger.Pros:+Good graphics and optimization. Game looks and runs very good on Intel HD graphics, which sounds a little bit odd.+light-hearted fun in multiplayer. If you, of course, playing it with a friend, not a random group of people.Cons:-Arcade physics. The thing that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off the most. You have to bloody drift in order to get through a tight corner, and if your car doesn't drift, you can always corner with a wall. In Race driver: Grid you spin all over the place if you do drift, but here, you HAVE to drift. The more appropriate title for this game is: ""NFS: Codemasters edition"".-No real motivation to do anything. (I'm sorry if i've missed something during career mode) In the first one you had money, here you have fans that don't do♥♥♥♥♥♥-Everybody drives like crazy. That's why i don't like to play it with some random people. Everybody is trying their hardest for you to fail, bashing into walls, bashing into you, bashing into a wall and make a great wall of cars, that is impossible not to hit and etc.Summary:Not a good game, arcade physics, DLCs that don't make any sense (exept for the one where you get a Koennigseg CCGT),and overall, the game doesnt make any sense, with an autosport series. If you like it -  go ahead, enjoy it, but personally, i prefer the first one and Grid Autosport.			"

I don't think so.So, let's kick it off with the new things. The things they added.- The LiveTrack. 100% unrealistic, painful if you like to know the tracks you are racing on, the LiveTrack is used for classic races or Endurance... Speaking of which:- Endurance mode. Basically, it's a fancy name to try and make you believe it's also brand new, when it's really just a race that ends at a specific time rather than a specific line.- Story. Let's face it, the first GRID was minimalist, story speaking. But it also didn't need it, and the lack of it - or the small presence of it - didn't bother me. This time, however, there is a scenario. This time, you are building the WSR, the World Series Racing. Some cinematics, some (fake) coverage by ESPN... It definitely feels more alive.Now, for the things they modified or deleted.- Cameras. No more interior camera - which is a shame, we'll admit it - and, more importantly, totally trashed up TV cameras - taking away all the value of the replays. No really, replaying your best drifts on GRID was like watching 2 Fast 2 Furious, in GRID2 it feels like the cameraman browses /r/trees on a daily basis.- Teammate. It was fun, knowing your fellow crew member was out there, helping you out on the track, pushing opponents out of the track, stealing the first place and apologizing deeply when he finished last. Now, all you have is the guy talking to you since day 1 (but you still don't know who it is) and complaining he'll have to mend your car when you wreck it.- The Drifting. It's hard to explain. But the drifting in GRID felt a hundred times better. Firstly, you were alone on the track, without stupid people pushing you out of the way because they forgot which race category they were in. Secondly, the vibe was astonishing - the japanse speakerman going crazy over your moves, the crowd... And lastly, it just felt more responsive. The combo system was nice and clear, the way the car drifted was purely arcade but so enjoyable...- No more rep/money system. GRID2 brings in the ""fan system"", already seen in Blur, for example. - Aaaaaand the way the sponsors work changed too. And this time, it clearly is below what GRID offered.That's not all, these are just the things that pop out first when I think about it. Now, the graphics are really nice, there are plenty of cars to choose from, and the tracks are still interesting. So ?1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIt's probably still better to grab it while it's on sale - hint: it's really cheap - but if you like arcade racing, and/or the first GRID, well, go for it.

												Grid 2 is a racing game that rewards skill without punishing you for the tiniest mistakes, letting you master a simple system with a forgiving attitude. It may stray too close towards the easy side of the scale at times, and it'll be interesting to see how the game works online (which unfortunately wasn't tested in this review), but its career mode is well worth playing and you won't be satisfied until you've mastered every single corner.Best Game Moment: Aggressively drifting round a final corner to take first place and win a championship.

												This isn't a sim, but neither was the first Grid game. What this is, is tons of fun. And not to mention, the graphics are absolutely stunning. I really like the courses as well. On city streets, and windy, country roads. There is just the right amount of grip and slip that just feels good with a Xbox controller. I say if you want realism. Go race a real car because no sim is going to give you G forces. I'm deffenetly going to spring some extra for the DLC.			"

												Short version: Not anywhere as good as Grid 1, but still a fun $5 for a racing game.  Multiplayer is pretty inactive & the DLC is mostly stupid.Long version:I was a huge Grid 1 fan, and at first play this game disappointed me at how different it is.  Grid 1 wants you to turn corners carefully, 2 wants you to drift drift drift all the time.  It's very arcadey & far from the sim based racer 1 is.  Multiplayer servers aren't very active, I think people have moved on to Autosport & other games.  I really hate the corner cutting ""feature"", its punishment enough when you accidentally go over gravel or grass, I don't need an additional penalty for a mistake.The maps get pretty old, even though they have you race on different sections of the same area.  The later parts of the game get really hard because the tier4 cars are nigh uncontrollable.  I had better times in the slower tier2 cars than I did the 200 mph+ tier4 cars because I crash at every turn in the tier3/4 cars.One thing this game did well was a variety of gametypes.  As opposed to just race, drift & head to head from 1, it added checkpoint, overtake, time attack & togue.As a comparison to Grid 1, it's very inferior.  As a cheap racing game, it's fun enough.Overall verdict: 7.2/10			"

												Wow at the time I got this game I thought it was awsome, its finally for the right priceas a racing fan I was let down that I cannot use my wheel to drive this game due to the reason of the view, it was a very big deal to many people to feel like you're in a car but that didn't come with grid 2 which was a letdown, some might say the originals was much better but this is fun too, The Dlc cars are super POWERFUL and you'll pretty much own everyone, Drifting was extremly hard in this game and well it felt good at time but at the same time it felt unatural.This game has+  Graphics are great+ The sound  is fantastic very realistic.+ Adrenaline pumping racing+ Theres alot of different gameplay modes you can do+ Multiplayer is smooth runs smooth+20 dollars or below is a reasonable price.- Not many customization on your vehicle and lack of it- Lots of people hated it because of the view, missing COCKPIT view was taken out of the game, very big deal for racers who wants immersion- DLC cars are overpowered- Drifting feels unsatisfying - game feels more arcadey this time around			"

												Like all racing titles from Codemasters, this one is another piece of crap. If you want a good racing sim, pick one from EA or Atari. You start with an undriveable car, that won`t make a curve if your life depended on it. That makes the game very frustrating. In terms on UI, this game is also a fail. Is most parts of the game, the only option to exit the game is to use ALT+F4. The ESC key won't always work and there is no way to skip the painfully long and slow cinematics. From a scale of 0-10, this game gets a very round ZERO.			"

Game was played on Hard6/10Pros- Great graphics- Good selection of cars- Nice tracks- Lengthy game(20+ hours)- Game feels ""real"" compared to Grid 1- Circuit races and sprints are very satisfying and provide a good amount of challenge- Can run smoothly on weak/medium PCsCons- AI is still♥♥♥♥♥♥ some cars are almost impossible to beat while the rest try to slow you down- Drifting sucks- Your car becomes unstable at high speeds. CPU can cruise the tight corners easily.- NO RACING LINE- Inconsistent difficulty- Grip cars feel uselessRace Driver Grid was a fantastic game, but in terms of driving it felt quite similar to the Need for Speed series. It feels more arcadey than realistic. Grid 2 on the other hand did a better job of making the game feel real. You can't just hit the pedal and force your car to turn. You have to find the right moment to brake and accelerate. The game feels much better in terms of circuit racing or sprints. You actually have to fight all the way to get to the number 1 spot. In Grid 1 it was quite easy to get to 1st. There are lots of cars as well, and they are classified as one of the three : Balanced, Drift or Grip. In my entire playtime I don't think I have ever used a Grip car for a race, unless I had no choice and the game forced me to use it. You're going to have to drift a lot in Grid 2, and some grip cars suck at drifting. Speaking of drifting, it sucks in this game. Grid 1 absolutely nailed drifting. It was perfect. Now drifting here is a 30 second track and no customizations. Plain horrible. It tried to go Japanese since most drift races are on mountain passes.The game still has no racing line, which can become crucial in those difficult tracks for the Vehicle Challenges on the higher tiers. There were 3 difficult challenges where the racing line would have helped significantly. The Jaguar at Hong Kong, the Benz at Okutama and the Pagani Huayra challenge. Cars also become unstable at high speeds while other cars can just stick to the ground and not slide. I've seen this several times already. I forcefully rammed a CPU car and took a 10 second lead, but he was able to catch up and beat me on the last corner. I've seen his style and even with the car he should not be able to just accelerate through corners at that speed. Don't be surprised if you see the CPUs blast through chicanes at 250km/hr without slowing down. It's a good game, but I can't recommended it. A lot of race types just suck and the circuit races and sprints are the only fun ones.			"

Moding posible ""only for singleplayer aloved"" !I give it a 10/10 as i never get any problems with it , spent a lot of hours playing it and enjoyed every second on it.Bad on it is only if you play MP with a bad looby where you catch a lot Rammer's and not skilled driver's , but this is not a codemaster's fail !

Stick this out long enough past the first season, there's new race modes that unlock that keep it feeling fresh. On sale this is a must buy for arcade race fans.			"

												Looks good. Everything else is S.H.I.T.E.When  you think NFS Underground 2 or Carbod had bad physics, think again. This one is BAD.Game should be called DRIFT, not GRID. i mean even effing 4by4 subaru or lancer is spinning and drifting on every corner, and god forbid you to touch the wall, u will be making 360 turn x10 times in no time. Flip the car over the roof x50 times - no problem, just touch that curb at slow speed.But man, graphics are good.Grid Online menu is crap. All those tiers and how to join particular game level? Dunno. VERY CONFUSING MENUS.Online challenges are fun. Weekly rivals WTF??!!!!! Finding online game is like finding Nemo (proably less sun tho).What else? oh, music - fine , good soundtrack.Make sure you turn off Voice volume, really those comments are annoying (but that goes to every Codemasters game, like DIRT, etc.)6/10 overall, and really just bought it because sales.played Grid 1 ages ago, but cant rememer it being so bad. Was it?anyway, this one is probably worth 12 bucks with all DLC.or was it too much Forza for me over last few years :)))))Gonna try Grid Autosport, see what its like. "

Though the landscapes are gorgeous, some of the car damage should have been more detailed. The AI is hit or miss from race to race with some of the races being super easy while others will have you restarting the race until uttter frustration sets in.Also the 'fan' counter gets old real fast esp when you cant skip it.All in all 5/10.

												GRID 2 is an arcade racing game made for players using a gamepad or their keyboard. If you want a realistic racing game, you should not buy GRID 2. I was very disappointed... I preordered it for 35,99€ and I have to say it was a waste of money. Because of that preordering I received a free copy of GRID 1, which was a big reason for me buying the game, because I really liked the car physics and graphics of GRID 1 at that time. Do not get me wrong, I still think GRID 1 is an excellent racing game! Actually it is the best I have ever played. I just can't understand what codemasters tried to do with GRID 2, I just don't get it...I played the first part of GRID and GRID 2 is a totally different game. GRID 1 had a cockpit view, which does NOT exist in GRID 2! For me personally the cockpit view is one of the most important things to make a racing game realistic. The developers said they invested much time in making the cars behave realistic on the asphalt. They failed miserably... Every car feels the same. There is no real difference. Drifting is totally unrealistic. If you want to drift you just have to fastly turn the wheel to one side, then turn it back to the other side and you are drifting. Normally when you're drifting in a realistic racing game or in reality itself you should lose time, but not in GRID 2. It feels like you always have to drift to maintain your speed. So many good game modes (drift-challenge, touge, profi-touge etc.) from GRID 1 are just left out completely in GRID 2. They tried to put a story into the game, which is actually a good idea. You have to show your skills in different racing leagues all over the world to get their appreciation and win them for the WRC (World Series Racing), a league where the best drivers of the world meet each other on the racetrack. The idea is great, but the implementation didn't succeed... It's always the same: Win in leagues, unlock new leagues, win against those leagues, win the WRC, win in new leagues, unlock, WRC...If you want to play a realistic racing game with great game modes and a cockpit view, buy GRID 1 instead of GRID 2.If you already played GRID 1 and think about buying GRID 2, because you liked the gameplay, do NOT do that. You will only be very disappointed. It has nothing to do with the previous version of GRID.			"

												Good and varied roster of cars. actually impressed to see cars like the BAC Mono in here. cars are pretty and detailed. graphics are very nice, but trees look very bad during the night/with fog. physics aren't that bad. however, cars drift too much (even if they are ""grip"") and the crash engine is very unforgiving, especially when crashing against AI (they don't seem to be affected if you crash against them. however, you will start making spins which is really, really frustrating). multiplayer is dead, which is a shame. not one of the best racing games i have played, but still pretty fun (if you can stand the problems it has)			"

												I like racing games.  I lean more towards the arcade racers as simulators don't do much for me.  I'm not a car guy and most of the things that sims go into mean absolutely nothing to me. Grid 2 is a weird one as it isn't really a simulator at all, yet it doesn't quite fit into the super-fast and drifty style of your common arcade racer. Burnout and Forza Horizon are the kind of arcade racers that are usually right up my alley.  Grid 2 just isn't quite there.  All of the tracks consist of tight turns through city streets and country sides and the drift controls just aren't tight enough to make this game stand out from the pack.  Too many times I've found myself leading a race for three laps only to blow in one hair pin turn that I *should* have drifted through.  Although, it's possible I just suck! Yet... I still find myself recommending Grid 2.  Despite my dislike of it, it's not horrible.  I still find myself drawn back to it time after time.  When the controls are working, the races are fun.  Just not quite Burnout/Forza Horizon fun.  The stickers are paint job options are fun, yet there's no real incentive as you just have them, you don't have to unlock them.  In fact, there's really not a whole lot of incentive to unlock stuff.  The more I type, the more it's kind of a tough sell. This racer's not great.  It's not the worst racer you'll ever play.  It's somewhere in the middle.  The important bit is, if you watch the sales, you'll find it cheap and it makes good filler in between the next big thing in urban racing excitement. "

												To the senses, this game is amazing. Beautiful graphics and with accurate and detailed sounds easily draw you in. After that, however, things can become a bit muddy. Is it a sim? Is it an arcade racer? It's difficult to tell exactly what this game was intended to be. And while it may seem a bit pedantic to complain, there's a point to be made. When going through the first few minutes of any game, it is essential to get a good feel for how things handle. Physics and controls are VERY important, and once you get a handle on what to expect, the better you become. That goes doubly so for racers. In a simulation game, physics and car characteristics vary from vehicle to vehicle, but all within reason; opponents follow the rules of their car. Conversely, arcade racers are allowed some wiggle room with drift or grip handling and wacky doodle physics to make the ride fun; opponents follow their own rules of performance. This game just kind of screws you around with everything. Car handling is weird and unpredictable, and the moment you get a hang of how goofy your car is, they make you switch to something else that is equally ridiculous and goofy. The ""marked"" opponents that you're supposed to ""watch out for"" have god-like attributes to their vehicles in most cases, as they always shoot to the front and away from the pack. So while you're busy flopping around trying to deal with your car on a new track you cannot practice on (another huge gripe), the marked opponent, in the very same car you have, is inexplicably way ahead of you.I don't exactly hate it, I'm still trying to get the hang of it, but everything is just so imbalanced that when I try to treat it like one type of racer, I'm immediately punished for it. Where's the fun in that?			"

												I have recently bought GRID autosport, which probably means that i am not going to be playing GRID 2 very regularly as i have migrated to playing autosport, so i decided that i would write a review, seeing as i was rather close to 100 hours so i think i know what im talking about, or atleast mostly.GRID 2 is an amazing game, probably the best racing game that i am yet to play, other than the new release of GRID which is infact GRID autosport. There are so many features and aspects that i like about GRID 2, but im not going to list them all as i would be going on forever, so im going to keep them blunt, short but informative at the same time.Things i liked about the game:--------------------------------The controls: The controls took me a matter of minutes to get use to, and from there i was able to drive nice and smoothly, without having to worry about pressing the wrong button on my remote. (I believe you can also use a steering wheel for this game).The detail/graphics: The maps, the cars, the road, even the cones. you name it. Everything looks brilliant. The reflections on the cars are brilliant, and this detail is consistent throughout the whole game, and the graphics that they have produced, can even run on my computer which i am suprised about. The game is not slow or laggy whatsoever, meaning that you can have a very smooth racing experience, but at the same time have a lovely eyesite of distant mountains, as you control your car.Music: The game has a variety of different tracks that are played throughout the game. The loading music, the main menu music, the racing music, all of it is of a high standard, and is great to listen to, and really makes you feel like your driving a car.AI: The AI of this game are great. The WSR campaign, which is pretty much a singleplayer mode, is absolutely realistic, due to the fact that the computer drivers have been programmed so good. When driving, the way that the drivers move and think are so lifelike, and occasionally challenge you if you do in-fact smash into the back of there car, but i wouldn't try it.Handling: All of the cars are tuned to perfection, and getting use to each type of handling, which each of the cars uniquely have is done with ease. Multiplayer: Although the multiplayer is on the verge of becoming dead, its still great fun when playing with a full lobby, and the feeling of taking another persons car out after them doing it before hand is beautiful. (Not that thats how you should drive.)Bad points about the game:-----------------------------What are you talking about? There are no bad points about this game! Despite all the people that have played GRID 2 and complained about it, i think that they should simply realise that codemasters took their time making this, as it is truly a masterpiece, and an experience that i am never going to forget. The game is absolutely brillaint, and upon buying GRID autosport which was released shortly after im reviewing this, i cannot wait to carry on with the next game in the series. Thank you so much codemasters for bringing us this game, and i would like to thank you for also releasing Autosport, as so far it is brilliant. Thank you, and i hope that this review has influenced anyone that is planning on buying the game.			"

												Yeah, this game is fun, I guess. Some of the mechanics are ridiculous, though.  If an NPC spins you out or even nudges your bumper mid-race, you are guaranteed to end up facing the opposite way you need to be, though, regardless of how well you try to steer out of it, and might as well just restart as there is no possible way to recover.  So just be forewarned - save yourself a lot of frustration and know that unless you race perfectly, be prepared to ""restart"" a lot of races.  Some races are factually unwinnable, especially the ones at the racetracks.  The best, though, are the races where you're all in the exact same car, but the NPCs can corner at 120mph and you spin out at 60.The game is fun, to be sure, once you know what you're doing, but just be prepared for a lot of WTF head shaking at the blatant cheating.  I am going to say that I recommend this game, but only if you can get it for two dollars or less.			"

												Grid 2 likes to use the tagline ""The Thrill of Driving"" to describe the game in a single marketing slogan.  I think that's a pretty apt phrase because this is a driving game that really, fully, single-mindedly commits to the ""thrill"" of driving as compared to other driving games both from Codemasters and other development houses out there which throw their focus more on the lavish depth of accuracy in the presentation of the cars, or the devoted attention to the sport of motor racing with a high emphasis on realism in performance.  No, Grid 2 is a game so devoted to that ""Thrill of Driving"" aspect that I think it's carved out a whole niche to itself: Driving Pornography.In Grid 2 you are encouraged to drive full tilt without consideration for gas, tire wear, or weather conditions.  You need not concern yourself about the damage you incur by driving clumsy, and there are no penalties for being unsportsmanlike.  All Grid 2 wants from you is to drive fast, fast, fast, and to feel awesome and look cool while you're doing it.  Here's some thoughts about what makes this game unique in presentation: you will be given cars that have minimal explanation of the differences between them and yet enjoyable handling subtleties are there which render some choices powerful while others are over-the-top suicidal until you've had 60+ hours of practice with them.  The single player campaign throws the beginner driver (without practice first) into the midst of tracks that can and will destroy your vehicle if you lose traction, then makes sure that the sun is shining in your face as you round hairpin turns.  You will be given control of cars that can do 220 mph in straight runs and then be asked to make near constant right angle turns through the narrow streets of Chicago.  Cost is literally no object here as your garage grows regularly in size because of the ephemeral power of ""fans"" which is a weak and poorly executed stand-in for ""money"" in the single player game.  You will drive your multi-million dollar supercars as though they were replaceable toys and slam them, drift them, and wear them out with gleeful abandon and then see them magically repaired at no cost or penalty for the next race.  For better or worse you'll never spend too much time on any given race as they typically last between two and six minutes in length and even the custom and online races limit you to no more than 10 laps at a time.  Grid 2 is also *EXTREMELY* drift-happy and loves nothing better than to see 12 cars sliding their way through an apex and bumping and slapping each other and the walls all the way.Driving pornography: Grid 2 is definitely not to be confused with a full depth driving simulation experience, -it is absolutely an arcade game and as such it is very, very approachable and very, very fun.As a followup to Grid 1, the sequel is pretty much more of the same with an even greater emphasis on the ""pretty"".  While the cars aren't as lushly rendered as Forza the presentation is slick and polished and there's a nice sense of differentiation between both the different tier levels of cars on offer and the various types within each tier.  The tracks come in many varieties from narrow street point-to-point journeys to real-world circuit tracks that offer more true sport-like experiences.  Unlike some other Codemasters racing games you won't be constantly bugged and mugged by the different personalities of the competition drivers although you'll still be able to pick out which of the AI drivers has been tweaked to always be at the head of the pack no matter what.  Unlike Grid 1 this sequel feels compelled to offer some sort of story explanation for why you're racing in so many different styles of cars and racing disciplines and I found the presentation to be ridiculous and unnecessary, particularly when my beginner racing performance (consisting of bulldozing my way through the lead cars in order to get ahead) was hailed as ""champion"" material by the ESPN hosts complete with inane online message forum ""fans"" frothing at the bit because of my awesomeness.Multiplayer has the potential to be really entertaining but at this point in the game's release it's pretty hit-and-miss.  For starters I found the my default U.S. server literally empty for days at a time until I read on a forum that you should change your regional setting to Europe (I chose London) where there's more people frequently playing (still sparse though with less than 7 race sessions at any given time).  Once I succesfully joined a match it was good to see that the tiered performance structure means that it's difficult for veteran players to have cars which are inherently better than what a newcomer would be able to compete against.  The bad news is that it doesn't matter because veterans will have memorized all the track layouts and know where to brake and accelerate and squeeze every millisecond of performance from the car choices making it tough to stay competitive until you've personally put in the aforementioned 60+ hours.  There's also a tendency for online matches to go with the ""full damage"" mode where collisions will regularly destroy your vehicle or at least cause you to hobble about the course on bare rims and minimal steering control.  Worse is the frequent situation where a slight mistake in the lead car of the pack will cause a massive unavoidable pile-up collision with the rest of the following.  Such a thing renders all your skill and track knowledge useless... it takes such a tiny error to screw things up for the rest and sometimes you'll find yourself with a twit who purposely takes the chance to screw with you.One special note is that demolition derby, the fun and guilty-pleasure free-download available, has a MAJOR bug in it where you will frequently discover your progress is set back an entire lap for no explainable reason at all which makes it damn near impossible to recover from.  It's bad enough that demolition derby encourages people to fu** with you by willfully inflicting fishtail spinouts but this bug stacks the deck against you from the start with a frequency approaching 8 out of every 10 races having this bomb blow up in your face.  I also have a serious issue with how the corner-cutting mechanic is executed.  The developers have stated in the first game they had to build indestructable barriers around the tracks in order to keep people from cutting corners and that had gameplay ramifications they wanted to avoid, so in Grid 2 the tracks are free(er) from such obstructions but if you do cut through a corner improperly you'll find your momentum immediately halted and you can't resume acceleration for a period of time ""equal to the time advantage gained by corner cutting"".  That's fine... in theory.  In practice it becomes very frustrating because it's possible to avoid the penalty hit if you're careful how you exit your shortcut but then there are corners where there's a wall two feet from the apex of the turn and if you drift through that two foot gap you'll be slapped down for it even though the supposed ""shortcut cheat"" advantage is almost nil and the course essentially requires you to move through that gap to maintain your speed.  Is Grid 2 worth buying?  I think $30 for the base game is worthy.  $15 to $10 is an instant purchase.  The DLC car packs are so-so... it's hard to figure out the differences between the 80(?) cars on offer so you could easily skip all the extra cars and not miss them.  If the ""Reloaded"" edition is on sale for less than $30 though, yeah, get that.  The new tracks and routes are worth buying since they help keep the track choices from getting too repetitive.I had lots of fun with this, and yeah.... soft-core driving porn.  It's like that.			"

Well I never picked up the full release of the game, but I'm glad I got Grid 2. It's everything I expected from a modern racing sim. The cars handle well, the destruction and performance degradation feels visceral and justified and my god the game is gorgeous. It's not for everyone, but for other racing fans out there, you'd be missing out if you never played Grid 2.			"

												Graphics are good.That's pretty much my only positive.Sadly, I have racing games that are more sim orientated as well as racing games that are more arcade orientated, so for me there was no need for GRID2.It doesn't have the nostalgia factor of old NFS titles (Most Wanted, Underground) although it does suffer (badly) from horrendous narrations telling me to drive faster, or drift...driftier. There are annoying cutscenes as well. Ugh.Far and away the most annoying thing was the incessant screen resolution errors - it kept resizing the game as a box in the middle of my screen - this has been a bane of a lot of games in my library: if it gives me customization issues, I'll close it and jump to the next most similar game.  There are very very few games nowadays that are worth the time to try and fix little issues and niggles.I'm not saying you won't enjoy it, but I found it not worth my time. I might come back to it and it'll work better. I might let it just hover in my library.I don't like it, I don't hate it. I probably won't talk about it again after I post this review - it's like reviewing the Lightly Salted crisp flavour.Update after a re-visitI recently revisited this game when going through my racing games in order to have a bit more of a comparison, and these are some points I noticed now (after sinking even more hours into other racing games as well):The cars seem to be locked behind a progress barrier. That means that you can't access them until you've unlocked them (or, if you can, I certainly couldn't find it). That formula worked for games like NFS Underground or Most Wanted, but gaming has changed since then.The cars and tracks have no realism to them. Which, I guess, is fine; but as I said - it's not really arcade-y enough to get away with that.I am seriously unimpressed with the ""drifty"" nature of the racing. Cars seemed far too likely to slide constantly; not an issue, but with a game like Ridge Racer it feels a lot more fun. Plus, I have Burnout in my library, so I see no need to play a game where the cars handle badly and it isn't fun.I played this on a Logitec G27 - this should explain a lot of my frustrations, since a game that supports a steering wheel and pedals shouldn't punish you for using it - lightest touch on the brakes locks you up and slides you around.Your pit crew yak away in your ear more often than a rally navigator. I have no idea why the dev thought this was a good idea.Ultimately - this game is okay, and this may have been a positive review if I hadn't already played games like NFS, Assetto Corsa, Ridge Racer, Burnout, Project CARS etc etc etc...it's kinda like your first relationship - feels perfect because you have nothing to compare it to. When you do, you'll hate it.			"

												TL;DR - Vroom vroom crash sometimes but smiley face. 6/10PRO:1. Good arcade racing - I've spent many, many hours in this game, primarily in the multiplayer section. While it can be frustrating at times with the amount of accidents people seem to get into, I've also had a great number of tremendously fun and close races2. Seeminly endless supply of new blood - lots of people are at or near the MP level cap (level 99), but there are usually a good number of lower levels floating about. While that mixture of levels and experience does segregate the field a bit on track (which is kind of a con really), it also evens out the gradient a bit. Also gives great opportunity for lower levels to learn which cars suit which tracks and how to corner effectively (NOT THAT THEY SEEM TO NOTICE!)CON: 1. Very poor DLC integration - things like the Spa pack provide content that only very rarely can be used. Not many people choose to host the extra tracks in custom events, and even if they do there are often problems in joining sessions. If you don't EXACTLY match the number of DLC packs they have, you can't join their game.For single-player only guys, this isn't an issue as you can use the content at your whim, but it's been the multiplayer that kept this game going for me2. Poor car balance - there are clear favourite cars in each of the four tiers. You can beat them in ""lesser"" cars, but only if you absolutely nail every single braking point and apex of every single metre of track. Cars which are already powerful get a great number of upgrade slots, while poor cars only have space for a handful, which don't even make a difference. "

												An accurate simulation of what would happen if you handed a bunch of 11 year olds the keys to some high powered cars and told them to just flatten the accelerator into the first corner with all the forethought and finesse their pre-teen brains can muster. Do you like either going in a straight line or getting sweaty palms because there is a 1 degree bend in the road and the car behind you had the brake pedal listed as an optional extra that the owner was too much of a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to fork out for? Then this is the game for you!			"

YouTube™ Video: Analog Reviews: Grid 2

			We take a look at Codemasters flagship tarmac based racing game Grid 2. Please leave you feedback in the comments below and be sure to like and subscribe!		

Grid 2 is about the role of your driver in the formation and proliferation of World Series Racing, an international racing series that encompasses several racing disciplines across a wide range of car types. While this structure makes sense in the context of the narrative it has the unfortunate side effect of wearing out each location's welcome. Each region has three or four primary race location with varying routes through each. While the tracks themselves are technically different they share sections and landmarks from tracks that you previously raced in. Spreading a dozen races across three locations where you encounter some of the same sections across various routes does not leave the impression that variety is this game's strong suit despite a track list that would indicate otherwise. Grid 2's greatest innovation is it's LiveRoute system. Basically track designs are modular and with LiveRoutes these sections of track are loaded on the fly completely randomizing the track and forcing players to react to each change since the mini map is unavailable. Each section of track comes together seamlessly without creating any awkward or impossible turns though some sections of track can be repeated several time throughout an event which really detracts from the novelty of the feature.Vehicles embody the characteristics of their real world counterparts but sliding and drifting are much easier and emphasized but Grid 2 is devoid of the turbo boosts and jumps that characterize pure arcade racers. Ultimately it's a system that is extremely enjoyable. Muscle cars roar and and corner like hippos sprinting around a KY jelly covered skating rink. Tuners slide around like asthmatic mosquitoes as their turbos hiss and wheeze while track cars warp across the asphalt and slice through corners like razors through the wrists of a My Chemical Romance fan. Unfortunately the car count is on the small side, encompassing less than fifty of the most elite performance vehicles from the past and present. Well I should say the most elite races not to wear Porsche, Ferrari or Lamborghini badges. Customization is also limited to changing wheels and adding garish liveries to your machines. Copious sponsor stickers also spoil your vehicle's aesthetics while offering an opportunity to complete objectives that earn WSR more fans. Togue events, Checkpoint races, Overtake events, Endurance races, Drift events, elimination races, and head to head races round out the event types. These events do an admirable job of keeping the main campaign from becoming stale. Likewise strong AI ensures that you have to work a bit for victories. You opponents can be really aggressive and full damage means that trying to play bumper cars in the corners can end your race or severely hamper your car's performance. Ricocheting off of your opponents in the first turn and holding the lead isn't as viable a strategy in Grid as it is other racing games.Car models are appropriately detailed though they lack cockpit views. Matte, gloss, metallic and pearlescent paint are convincingly rendered and the damage models are unrivaled. Hoods, bumpers, fenders, spoilers and trunk lids can be smashed off and tires can even rupture. Geometry wrinkles and deforms after impacts in a rather convincing manner. As great as all of this is what really stands out are the tracks... Sparks from overhead subway rails shower the streets of Chicago and papers blow over the roadway, mists hover over the pavement in California as leaves blow around. Dubai's glorious skyscrapers and yachts dot the landscape. In short the tracks seem alive... It's a nice departure from the often drab and dead cityscapes that many games have you race through. The sound is also solid. Races are mostly scored with a symphony of pistons pumping like drums, turbos whistling like woodwinds and tires squealing like the string section. Exhausts howl, echoing off of mountain sides and tunnels and the echoing of your opponent’s vehicle seconds off of your lead can be intense.			"

												 GRID was a continuation of the story-driven racer in which you play the central role of a burgeoning raw driving talent, making your way from one event to the next. GRID 2's handling model feels tighter and slightly more accessible than in the first GRID, and while the rival AI seems a little more forgiving, it's still incredibly aggressive, especially in the later seasons. while you're relegated to the back of the pack, Surely if you're consistently winning races, you should be starting in pole position too?When you do inevitably crash, you can use a Flashback, which makes a welcome comeback for GRID 2, in a far more streamlined guise. Difficulty once again dictates how many Flashbacks you have at your disposal, with normal giving you a generous five. We still managed to regularly use these all up though.Not only has Flashback been refined, but the entire game has been stripped down to brass tacks. Sadly that means you're no longer free to surf eBay for bargain cars, and in fact shopping for rides has been dispensed with entirely. Now you're simply granted cars for completing races, presented with a choice of two very similar models from different manufacturers at certain junctures. You can then win the second car through completing a vehicle challenge in which you have to beat the target time in a hot lap.Multiplayer features all of the various racing modes from career, including Checkpoint, Touge, Drift, Elimination, Race, Overtake and so on, and spreads them across the single-player online Global Challenges - that can be completed at your leisure each week - and the more traditional competitive multiplayer aspect. This all has a persistent levelling system, with levelling up granting access to newer and better cars, while any cash you gain can be used to purchase upgrades for your rides.GRID 2 is a more than worthy. Yes, the lack of a cockpit view is somewhat disappointing, but when the handling and controls are so tight and enjoyable, it's hard to complain. Add to that some blistering visuals with truly stunning lighting, and you have one of this current generation's finest racing titles. Not just that, but GRID 2 might just be the last truly great racing game of this generation.			"

												It's just so bad . First of all your car is made out of paper, but all other cars are made out of alluminium .  I doesn't matter which car you pick , hell if you even had a frickin monster truck it would according to this game also be made out of paper . But that's not the worst part oh no . The worst part is the fricking handling of the cars . The cars are so out of control you would had better luck doing it in real life . Other than that there's not much to complain . It's just so dissapointing , this could have been a great racing game but it just fails on the most simplest thing's .			"

												GRID 2 is one of the best driver games I ever have played, and the most fun driver game I know. Race against your friends, beat your pwn highscores, play many of the gamemodes and much more. There is always something to do in GRID 2.GRID 2 is a skill based driver game, which I liked very much. It is very great to see a driver game, where you needs to learn how to control the car. This gave me new challenges, which I enjoyed a lot.If you prefer to play Single Player, the game also has a Carrer Mode. I enjoyed the Carrer Mode from start to the end. You're starting as a driver, who not has many fans and not many sponsors. But every match you win, every season you win will more sponsers get interested in you and more fans will come. It's like being a real driver. The goal is being the best driver in the world, and winning all ""World Series Racing"" which is the seasons. GRID 2 will only give you a great experience, and it is recommended so much if you like driver games.  "

												I bought Grid 2 because of the amazing game called Grid 1. Grid 2 brings good graphics and details with a lot of sound especially when you're going around the race track. However this game is not as good as Grid 1 as you get the cars during the game, so it's pretty much straight forward for when you're playing on single player. It would of been great to have the visual of what part of your vehicle is broken instead of some audio saying ""Your left wheel is damaged, expect some pull when you turn.""The game would have been good if it carried on with the cars mileages and the price of them as this made you think more on saving on your budget.I’ve tried multiplayer once and didn’t really enjoy it as it’s just the same concept as single player but you just play with other people and gain levels. I can’t really say much about it as I’ve only played one game and didn’t enjoy it much.The game is good overall but it could have been much better if they didn’t change it all!  "

TL;DR While GRID 2 challenging and sometimes enjoyable, refusing to allow players access to more than just 'Drift"" cars unless they purchase cut-content style DLC ultimately ruins the experience.Those of us who hate Drifting get nickel and dimed by DLC that should have been included in the game itself.I like the difficulty of this game. I like that it's hard, that it makes me think about what I'm doing, that it's closer to a simulator than most games are these days. That's all great. I really wish I could give this game the thumbs up.But I can't.This game has decided that ""drifting,"" a showboating activity, should be an integral part of racing. The Majority of cars you have access to in this game are ""Drift Cars.""Or to put it another way, this game features cars with looser back ends than a trucker with irritable bowel syndrome in a budget diner. You can't slide around a corner in any of these cars without the back end kicking out, because the game wants you to take your car sideways. I really enjoyed the ""grip"" style cars, where when one slid around a corner, the back end stayed right where it should, instead of trying to rub itself on a guardrail. But Codemasters decided to make grip cars DLC. In the beginning of Season 4, instead of offering me a Drift Car, a Balanced Car, and a Grip car, it offered me two drift cars, and the chance to unlock more cars. Great, I said, and went through the painful process of unlocking each secret car one by one, only to discover that they are all bleeding drift cars. Every single one of them.I can get my hands on a grip car if I purchase some DLC.Which I'm not doing.Instead, I'm telling you not to spend money on this game, and uninstalling it immediately. Codemasters, I'm never buying a racing game from you again. Cutting grip cars from the game and then trying to sell them back to me as DLC was a terrible idea, and one that's lost codemasters a customer.  "

												First to say, I really don't like playing racing games. I tried this some time ago with mouse and keyboard and maybe one hour later I gave up and uninstalled a game. But now I got controller and it is completly different. Just finished the third seasson and game is really fun. A lot of cars to choose. I like the rewind feature. Some of the maps are really beautiful (dubai) and graphics overall is very nice. Game consist of a lot of racing modes also with I believe some completly optional which adds fans or cars, it is a nice feature. One thing that I do not like is that no matter in which position I end in previous races, I almost all time starting at last position and in some situations is really hard to get to the top from that.

I hate DLC's -No cockpit view-Multiplayer: barely players, no chatbox, takes ages to level up. If you do find a lobby, chances are big ppl try to crash into you. -AI cars: they suck, they take the corners extremely slow and ride extremely fast on the straights. Passing them without hitting them is like taking a♥♥♥♥♥♥without♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ -No practice or free mode where you can drive around solo in a map for testing cars or doing time trials.

It's this that bothers me most.-Lack of ""real"" circuits like Spa (DLC : /), Monaco, Silverstone, Abu Dhabi etc. Although the street circuits look nice and are fun to play, they all look the same. -career mode: pretty boring imo. This is way to easy. You pass/crash into all the AI cars in the first round and then you ride solo until you finish. Overall the game is fun but only if you can play it with at least one friend. It's pretty nice when you're in an online lobby with more than let's say 6 ppl, especially if it's a clean and fair race, but unfortunately this is rarely the case. This game is clearly an arcade game. If you want a realistic racing game, don't get it but buy something like F12012. 7/10 for meRemember to put your seatbelts on and drive safely! "

												I just picture some central casting area with a bunch of guys in wraparound Oakleys, soul patches and/or half goatees, a 3/4 backwards Monster Energy baseball cap and a jersey of some kind, all desperately pleading with a single video game producer for them to be the next voice of the newest random extreme sports game like jet-skating or wind-flying or kite-masturbating. Yeah, it's one of those games, where someone who just snorted a bunch of coke in an ADR booth off an intern is telling you  how many social media followers you've just earned by power-sliding over 100 feet. If you're in 8th place prepare to be♥♥♥♥♥♥shamed by an LA producer's idea of what should motivate the target divorced father of six with dreams of running Daytona and a $20,000 gaming rig demographic.This game creates a ridiculous and jarringly inconsistant world of high stakes street-racing that seems to be sponsored by Microsoft, as they have the money to shut down the city of Chicago so you can place dead last in a junky old ford. It's ""edgy"" as defined by a room full of white forty-year old men.Anyway, everything is shiny and the things smash up real good so you should buy it on sale for $.99 Just turn off the announcers.

												In short: Great racing game.Longer version: You're being discovered as a talent in motor sports by Patrik Calahan and he tells you about this idea he's been having: WSR - World Series of Racing. In order to make this idea come true he would need a guy who could persuade different driving clubs over the world to participate in the series. So...The first season you're driving in the US, the second one in Europe, the third one in Asia... and the fourth one is the best drivers combined. What ""grinds my gears"" is that the fifth season makes the game SOMEWHAT outstaying its welcome, it doesn't need the fifth season since it's pracically the fourth one but with some faster cars.Also... Codemasters decided to remove the cockpit view. WHY?!?! It's the best one.But I recommend this to anyone looking for a fun (arcadey) racing game.			"

												I had the original Grid on xbox along with Forza 3 and while Forza puts you to sleep playing it Grid kept you wide awake. To this day Grid is the only racing game i've played where you actually get a real sense of speed when racing.Grid 2 isn't as good as the first, they took a few things out like being able to spectate when waiting to race when a session has already started (you can now only spectate if you had already been playing and crashed/retired) . I also don't like the interface either.Car handling is similar to the first Grid but maybe slightly easier? i still get the same sense of speed playing this that i did playing the first one, so in that sense it's just as addictive for me playing it.Graphics with everything turned up to max only really seem marginally improved over the original (but then the first one looked great to begin with), I guess the smoke effects have improved and the exhaust heat.I should warn people actually that if you buy it now you really need to buy the car DLC as well to stand a chance in a race as you have to level up to buy certain tiers of cars. If you don't have certain cars unlocked you will only be able to realistically come 6th place in a race, you won't be able to win or come in the top 3 that's for sure. Also what's ridiculous is you can only unlock tier 4 cars (highest tier supercars) when you are in the mid 20 ranks. I am rank 31 right now and put in about 70 hours of play time, so you are looking at playing for 50ish hours to unlock the last tier of cars without DLC. The game does loan you a car if you don't have one for the required tier but the one they loan you for tier 4 is terrible, can't steer or turn to save its life. The cars they loan you for tier 2 and 3 are fine, tier 1 not so much.If you played and liked the first game you will probably like this, if you haven't played the first one i'd wait till it's on sale to try it out as it's a polarizing ARCADE game (not a sim) as you might not like the fairly simplistic car handling.But saying all that, the sheer sense of speed you get while playing it you can't get anywhere else, and that's what does it for me which is why i'm addicted to this racer.7.5/10			"

												When I was looking at some information on this game, I found a quote from Codemasters in relation to the length of time it would take to complete Grid 2. This game is supposed to take more than 30 hours to complete.“We’ve noticed a trend in recent years with some of the supposedly ‘big’ games that were actually six hours long, and we didn’t feel that was sufficient value for money for our fans at all. We wanted to make sure there was so much more for them to do.”Normally I would complete a game prior to reviewing it, but in this instance I could not bring myself to do it. I will start with the cons first as this will give me some time to think of something good that this game has to offer.Cons:	Realism in this game has gone out the window. Codemasters pride themselves in the amount of effort they spend on realism in their F1 series. Unfortunately this is the only series that has remained true to its original. The original grid game was a lot of fun and on both the Xbox and PC version I have spent untold hours playing (mainly drifting) and hat a lot of fun. This game just doesn’t have the same appeal. Even The Colin McRae series died along with Colin Dirt 1 was the last of the series that was any good. Dirt 2 was supposed to be a homage to Colin McRae, but it was appalling.	Drifting: DRIFTS ARE NOT POPPING THE HANDBRAKE AND DOING A LITTLE SLIDE ROUND THE CORNER. Grid was so much fun when it came to the drift challenges. There was nothing more satisfying than pulling off a linked chain of drifts for an entire lap and then watching the replay for that satisfaction. All you do in this game is pull the handbrake (or E-Brake) coming in to a corner, do a little slide, drive up to the next corner and repeat. You cannot keep drifts going in this game. For those of you that are looking at buying this game to relive those font memories of drifting around an entire track but with revised graphics, don’t bother. Just like me, you will be sorely disappointed.	Your friendly AI team coordinator that is in your ear every race: Even if your mechanical knowledge is strictly limited to knowing where the fuel goes in to your car, you will find the commentators remarks cringe worthy. Unfortunately when he first introduced himself at the start of the game, something in the back of my mind was telling me that this game was not going to live up to its predecessor.	It’s not fun: There are 2 types of games, ones that you look at the time and think; “gees, is that the time, I should have eaten 5 hours ago” and those that make you look at the clock like you are at work and are waiting impatiently for 5:00 so you can go home and do something FUN. Grid 2 falls in to the latter category. 	No cockpit view… Not that it matters in an arcade racer… But it was a real game it would need an in car view.Pros Pro	It looks pretty.Codemasters should look at creating entire new games when they want to change from realism to arcade, instead of leeching off the popularity of their previous games and developing cruddy arcade racers. Basically, this game would be better if they didn’t call it Grid 2 and get everyone’s hopes up. "

												All in all I would recommend this game... BUT !! There are some issues..1) Where on Earth going side by side with another car makes you unable to turn your car AWAY from the other car ??? Soooo annoying...2) The Arcade style is a bit too much I would say, definetley too much disadvantage of not having a wheel, cuz the buttons sometimes cause funny and unrealistic accidents, and then you'll have to use a FLASHBACK, which is the dumbest thing in a car game... Learn to drive..3) AI is often stupid, and on higher Tiers they don't stand a chance, but you always have to fight through them, zig-zagging all the time.. which is fine...4) Multi... The cars are way too unpredictable and sensitive, so even if you don't want to cause any trouble for the other players, there will always be lots of accidents, not to mention the intentional T-bones and FishTails...On the Contrary, the game feels just about right, and with practicing a track a few times you can constantly set your lap records, the cars are awesome, the maps offer a wide variety, you can find which suits you.Btw DLC cars are pretty damn powerful...

Graphics:The graphics looks really nice and I'm on a older GPU, GTX260 and it still looks really good even if it's now maxed, with sparks flying when someone rolls their car or crashes into a wall.Sound/Soundtrack:The sound are good i must say, especially the crash noise, which if you drive like me hear pretty often. You can hear what other cars are doing around you even if you don't see them. The sound track tho, the first thing i did was to go in the menu and turn it off, haven't turned it on since i started it the first time.Handling:The handling isn't great, the car tends to drift way to much and when drifting have super tires that can grip anything, but if you see it from an arcade point of view it's not to bad, there is worse but there are worse. I do find the handling of the destruction derby cars to be better then the other cars, they actually feel heavy.Multiplayer:Here is where GRID 2 shines, many different game modes, from racing, drifting to destruction derby. And it's easy to create a lobby and start a game and you can create a mini league with up to 5 races which is super nice.Cockpit view:This is a hot one, when i first heard it i disregarded the game totally, but when i got i and started driving, it isn't something i really miss, sure i use it when playing Assetto Corsa and GTR2, but they are a completely different genre. The hood view is in my opinion just as good or even better in this type of game.DLC:I don't have any numbers here, but it feels like half the cars are DLC packs, which is totally rubbish, there are 11 pay DLC packs on steam 11!! That's like 10 to much. If i buy a game i want all the content. Soon Codemaster will starting to slice up the F1 games, knock on wood...Tracks/Cars:As said above there aren't many cars unfortunately, you've got your standard European BMW, American Muscle, some JDM, but it's not much. And for tracks i was disappointed, i usually like proper race tracks, but there are so few (without DLC) that the only tracks i tend to race are the A to B tracks.Overall:If you look at it for what it is and not for what it's predecessor was, it's a very fun game to play with your mates, get a lobby full of 12 people and just race. If you don't mind the drift handling it has and the lack of cars and tracks and like me find it for a fiver, it's definitely worth it.And for you hardcore GRID1 fans wait to see what Grid Autosport may have to offer.

												Though it is somewhat enjoyable, I cannot recommend this game. After six hours of playing, I can say that every new race just adds frustration and disappointment.  The AI is a nightmare Sunday afternoon. Whenever a corner comes along, they all slam on their brakes in syncronization and take it at a driving-school safe speed. When not on a corner, they form a massive rolling roadblock between you and the ""chosen one;"" the AI who started in first. Except in very rare cases, the AI do not trade positions.  If you are tired of the AI, you can try a gate-to-gate race, where every time you pass a truck you get points, every truck you pass increases the points given by the next truck, and losing paint resets the combo. However, you will soon find that the truck drivers are the same AI drivers, except after having been out partying and drinking all night. They have no ability to maintain their lane and seem determined to slam into you as you try to pass.  There are three types of cars. Drift, Grip, and Balanced. To me, drift seems to be like trying to drive a greased whale on ice, grip is the absolute reverse (whatever that may be. A rough shark in sand?), and balanced is so far in the middle that it is incapable of either drifting or gripping. Probably with more practice I could make any of the cars perform, but I simply don't care to.  In summary, I would suggest downloading the demo and just playing that. It's free and has most of the experience of the full game.			"

One of my personal favourites when it comes to racing games.Pros+ Good choice of cars, even without DLC+ Every car feels different+ Challenging gameplay+ Lengthy campaign+ Easy to use livery editor+ Graphics are amazing - Enviroments, Car Damage etc+ Fairly good choice of different modes+ Flashback modeCons- AI acts as if you're not there, they'll crash into you a lot- Can be grindy at times (Personally I like the grind but others may find it boring/repetitive)- Some of the cars are quite awkward to drive, the back ends will spin out too muchIf you enjoy racing games, then you'll probably enjoy GRID 2. If you're not very experienced with the genre then you may find GRID 2 a little too hard at the start.If you're going to pick this game up then I reccomend using a controller as it makes the game much more enjoyable!Hope this review has helped you decide whether or not to pick up the game!

												There are many better racing games on the market and very few more pointless.This takes what was good about the first Grid and turns it down a notch, so they could spend more time designing a menu screen that would look at home on a Need for Speed game. Originality is not a selling point of this title, nor is the racing. Graphically it's alright, nothing that will save it from a sale purchase at best. That is of course once you manually change the replay file to read-only so you don't suffer stuttering throughout the race, once again the customers solve the lazy devs work. Is it good? No, is it worth buying? If you own GRID, Need for Speed, Dirt... No...CTRL-C, CTRL-V racing at it's worst.			"

												All in all I would recommend this game... BUT !! There are some issues..1) Where on Earth going side by side with another car makes you unable to turn your car AWAY from the other car ??? Soooo annoying...2) The Arcade style is a bit too much I would say, definetley too much disadvantage of not having a wheel, cuz the buttons sometimes cause funny and unrealistic accidents, and then you'll have to use a FLASHBACK, which is the dumbest thing in a car game... Learn to drive..3) AI is often stupid, and on higher Tiers they don't stand a chance, but you always have to fight through them, zig-zagging all the time.. which is fine...4) Multi... The cars are way too unpredictable and sensitive, so even if you don't want to cause any trouble for the other players, there will always be lots of accidents, not to mention the intentional T-bones and FishTails...On the Contrary, the game feels just about right, and with practicing a track a few times you can constantly set your lap records, the cars are awesome, the maps offer a wide variety, you can find which suits you.Btw DLC cars are pretty damn powerful...

												Terrible game, AI cheats, car design is a mis-mash, zero attempt to adhere to the realism of many of the cars.  AI ignores players and plows into players ad-nauseum.  Cars are randomly fat, slow, or drift happy (drift is so unreal it's moronic).  Drift design ignores the laws of physics.  Drift, tire squeeeeeeeellll.Lens flare is often blinding, camera shakes absurdly over 120 MPH (why do all the bad racing games have this effect?), most of the races in the campaign are done without a sighting lap, so you'll be at a perpetual disadvantage.  The random levels are stupid, most of the locations are the same one backwards and forwards with such little variety.  It's like playing a late 90s racer with new graphics.0/10 at worst, 5/10 at the best moments.  DO NOT BUY.			"

												The graphics are really nice for this game, the car control feels the same as grid 1 with some minor improvements. The story section (world series) I've only done a few races but so far seems decent. The multiplayer has alot of fun when you get into a full room. Not sure on how many modes there are to do, there seems to be a few but only raced so far. The amount if cars is decent and could do with more. The audio of the game are good, from the engines to tyre screeching around roads. The little features are cool like a car infront if you wipes out goes through grass and sand and covers the road in smoke nice. There are a few things that I like but otherwise it is an improvement of grid 1. All I can say really. I hope for more cars but I know they will be paid DLC. If you enjoy grid 1 then you will enjoy this. Worth the cheap price for this game £26 and that's a bloody good price specially on this game. Grid is a superb game and so is grid 2.			"

												One of the most frustrating games to play. The cars feel like old Buicks on leaf springs, you can't control them without spinning out or being all over the road. I've been playing several racing games with an XBOX 360 controller; RACE series, GT/GTR series, NFS MW & NFS HP (not ""realistic"" in any sense but controls are great), GRID, and some others. In this game, you have tighter controls using the keyboard. The levels in the city are a blast, you can feel the excitement of racing through the streets in a pack of cars. The contry road level feels like on you're on ski's, while the AI has perfect handling.			"

												Despite the fact that you're using Steam, you need to make a special account to play this online. Since I didn't want to, I played single player. It was okay, but I really couldn't enjoy it. They force you to use drift cars for the first few missions and as a long time Forza player, this made these races really REALLY annoying. The drift physics are really weird and you can't skip these missions. I even have other cars from DLC which I should be allowed to drive in the races, but they restrict the cars to ONLY the drift car you start with, then ONLY the drift car you win during that race. You get to pick between two prize cars, but they were both drift. Maybe I'm just oversensitive, but the refusal to let me not drift took all fun out of the game for me.			"

Always be on noob alert, they'll take you out on the first corner. This game is region-locked, meaning you'll only be connected to the server according to your steam download region.

Few hours into career I finally got to fun mountain passes and drifts.. that was the highlight of the game for me.It got variety (cars/races/race types).. but I don't like the whole ""sport"" thing in race at all. I mean the whole arranged tracks, ads EVERYWHERE. Side blockages and people... ""cheering"" just is.. not fun for me. I've been always fond of ""street race"" types. Got that satisfying ""danger"" feel.Nevertheless... drift handling was smooth and enjoyable, that I liked. But turning was so damn sensitive, I moved my stick a bit and damn car just instantly reacted and turned way too fast.Game got dull really fast for me...There is cockpit mod on the internet and some sort of overhaul mod. But I could not be bothered with this game anymore. Thus I'm done with it. As a game it's good. But for me personally it was borefest for most part.DROPPED5/10If you into car sports thematic and arcade racing you will probably like it much more than I did "

												Grid 2 is a fun racing game! If you want a arcade game more than a simulator, this is the best choice. The handling of the cars is more arcade than simulation. Very fun, many cars to choose from. Multiplayer is good aswell, recommended!			"

												Good game, but multiplayer has some serious flaws.1: Noobs are at a disadvantage from the off, the vets have faster, tuned cars, so you have little chance to win.2: If you cut a corner, your car gets slowed down for 3 seconds. The system is flawed, other players can push you off track, you receive the penalty and you did nothing wrong. Oversteer or understeer on the cars can also cause you to go off track, you get penalty, your race is ruined. Others players use you car as their brake, pushing you off the track, you get the penalty3: Grid, the grid is flawed, if you get pole, you're in with a chance of winning, unless your car isnt as fast as the others then you're not in with a chance. if you're at the back or in the middle, it is highly likely you car will be smashed up into the first few corners by the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bags who cant drive.Other than thosethings and a few others like the various dlc, then it's a good game. I didn't buy it, so those things aren't as annoying as they would be.			"

												I'm greatly enjoying this game. Love the handling - reminds me of PGR.Runs really smooth with my HD 7870. I'd go as far as to claim that this is the best looking Racing Game available at this moment - since Need for Speed Rivals has been crippled to 30fps and Forza 5 has been downgraded to accomodate to the Xbox One's lacklustre performance ;PMy only gripe with GRID 2 so far is its businessmodel and pricing - there should have been no pre-order incentives to begin with - since there is no shortage of supply or shipping cost when it comes to digital distribution. I shouldn't be paying more just because I choose to buy the game during the week of its release rather than paying ahead of release... I simply like to be able to access the stuff I buy immediately once I put my money on the table. In addition I'm not a big fan of microtransactions only devalue the initial purchase and make people hold out for Sales and Collectors Editions... which I did. Aside from being rather pervasively integrated into this game - most of the car-pacs seem to be variations on the cars you can unlock in the game - thus don't seem to affect the balance of the game.The one DLC that does offer something interesting (Destruction Derby) comes at no additional cost.It appears that some Tier 3 cars which you should be able to win in career mode are locked away behind some nasty difficultiy spike - but thankfully you are able to switch difficultiy in the options at any time during your career which negates the frustration.I'm having a blast with this game so far - the WSR is a brilliant idea and provides a lot of diversity and motivation. There's a distinct Street Race Action-Movie feel to the game and its events which make it very cohesive - though its gritty Sepia tone and Hollywood Soundtrack may not be for everyone... but this is more down to personal preference and subjecitve perception. The Car demolition and aggressive AI work really well and add an additional layer to the challenge.I'm not missing the Cockpit View all that much, since I don't use it for racing - In other games I mostly use it  to check out the interiors - it kinda adds to the feel of driving a real car. Maybe with the arrival of Occulus Rift the Cockpit View will become relevant once again?All in all I can recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenging Racing Game.9/10: Top of its Genre			"

												Graphic, sound are good, damage physics is good.But the most important thing in racing games, Car physics (control) is really bad.It's no where near simulation. It's somewhere near arcade, but it's not. It's like... somewhere between them and it's awful.In this game, you go through corners faster with drifting than braking and following the racing lines. It's ok for arcade style, but then it tries to be like simulation, tiny error will ♥♥♥♥ you up and make you lose places or even crash your car (that's why there is rewind feature?). This control will make you very frustrated when you go deeper in the career mode (when your cars are faster and facing harder components).May be you can do better after practicing more with this game. But when you played another racing games, no matter it's simulation type like F1 2013 or arcade type like NFS, you will find it hard to adapt to this controls. It's very unique that no racing game is similar to this.This game shows potential but it's totally ruined by its car physics.			"

												So a quick ""review"". PROs and CONs first. Then some comments & random notes I have about the game.(note, my #/10 score = MY ENJOYMENT + minimal thought of gameplay+graphics/sound+story etc.. )PROs:+fair amount of cars+fair amount of race types+fair amount of races+drifting felt for most part nice+""physics"" were fun (crashing and vehicle falling apart was nice toucn)CONs:-handling felt too quick and floaty (turning was way too sensitive)-too arcady-lack of vehicle customization-too ""sporty"" thematic (I'm not fond of them)-no cockpit view (can mod it in though)Comments:First I started playing I didn't like handling at all but got used it. Few hours into career I finally got to fun mountain passes and drifts.. that was the highlight of the game for me.It got variety (cars/races/race types).. but I don't like the whole ""sport"" thing in race at all. I mean the whole arranged tracks, ads EVERYWHERE. Side blockages and people... ""cheering"" just is.. not fun for me. I've been always fond of ""street race"" types. Got that satisfying ""danger"" feel.Nevertheless... drift handling was smooth and enjoyable, that I liked. But turning was so damn sensitive, I moved my stick a bit and damn car just instantly reacted and turned way too fast.Game got dull really fast for me...There is cockpit mod on the internet and some sort of overhaul mod. But I could not be bothered with this game anymore. Thus I'm done with it. As a game it's good. But for me personally it was borefest for most part.DROPPED5/10If you into car sports thematic and arcade racing you will probably like it much more than I did "

Posted: June 19, 2015
												There's not a lot to say about this game. The main point to highlight is that it gets the job done as a simcade (perhaps a little more on the arcade side) racing game. I'll start with the good. One thing that is truly remarkable about this game is that the graphics are pretty impressive given the fact that it can run on Intel HD graphics. It looks and feels good, with good menu layouts and organization. Campaign is a good length, although it can get repetitive if you're not a super fan of racing. The variety of tracks is good enough and the amount of cars they have is ridiculous. Especially if you get the DLC, you might not get around to trying out all of them. The game modes are also pretty entertaining; there's a range of styles from a simple race, to overtake, to endurance, to touge (basically 1v1). You'll encounter all of them in the campaign mode if you decide to play your way through it. With all this being said, it's easy to see this is an all around good game that will keep you busy for a little while if you enjoy racing games.Now it's time to talk about the bad. Thankfully, there's nothing terrible or broken about the game. The issues I see are really just areas where they could have improved. First, the AI doesn't seem very skilled in my opinion. Even when I set the difficulty to hard on a custom event, I find it easy to just pass everyone and claim a podium spot. It might just be that I'm a good driver, but as far as competition goes, there's not much of a challenge. I do however notice a difference between the beginning of the campaign and the end. It does get harder as you get better vehicles. Towards the end it becomes harder to obtain that 1st place victory on your first try, but it's nothing stressful. Another thing that bugged me was a good atmosphere that has been slightly tainted with the lack of a true soundtrack. For this simcade, I could tell it would be good to have some music that intesifies the race and makes an effort to make things interesting, even when you're leading by 10 seconds. There's only music for the eliminator events, which is a good idea, but the whole scheme feels unbalanced given that's the only time you'll get to listen to some tunes. Lastly, the biggest issue is that this game is really just single-player. The multiplayer portion is pretty much useless at this point since no one is on. It's a big shame because I don't feel like I can write a complete review without trying out the online gameplay, but it doesn't seem like I'll be getting a chance anytime soon. My guess would be people just got bored, so maybe all that's needed is a more engaging online mode, but it is what it is. For $8.99, this is a great deal for a ""single-player"" racing game. It does what it does well and keeps you entertained for a significant amount of time. Great campaign, graphics, and car selection. One thing I forgot to mention is that I really like the customization options for your vehicles. A huge variety of liveries and designs is available to suit your style, and even with all the vehicles in the game, it's still possible to have a different design on each and have thousands of combinations left over. There's little to complain about the game, so it's worth it to grab it when it's on sale. Since there's really no multiplayer, if I were to see it listed at full price, I'd pass.Final verdict: 8.1/10			"

												 GRID 2 is an arcade fun racing game, is not any realistic or serious car racing genre so if your mind are looking for some serious car racing I strongly suggest to look for other title to avoid disappointment. What can I tell from my experience by playing GRID 2? To this time 2017, GRID 2 still offer one of the most gorgeously stunning looking in game graphic  of environment,surrounding and vehicle as well. it look immersively amazing and polished. As for the gameplay and control for my taste; it feel like GRID 2 emphasize pretty heavy on drifting, so here and there almost every vehicle I drive just need some plus-minus and understanding of handling to catch the drift.GRID and GRID 2 has a totaly different handling and control for the vehicle. Either you get used to both of em or you going to dislikes one of it, so maketh your mind which would you consider to buy and play em! That's how I feel for both of the game. If you plan to bought GRID 2, please just ignore GRID by the time you get used to the handling and then you try to play GRID it would just mess up both of your game rhythm. From this, I understand WHY much GRID player complaint GRID 2 feel like driving on top of ice and GRID 2 control. Overall I had to sayeth; for a 75% discounted car racing game, GRID 2 is not a bad game. GRID 2 still able to offer car racing adrenaline rush and a good racing game at the end of day,not to forgot the amazingly stunning graphic. Although GRID 2 come with pretty limited customization but the paint job is seriously good and fun to play with. Save yourself a couple of buck and buy another car racing game if you plan to grab the full pack with DLC, You can just ignore all the DLC it don't make much a difference from usin factory preset car to run all the lap, you will drift and race just fine and have fun just the same or you could just choose which DLC content that have your prefer car instead of grabbing all of em.

												A highly robust racing game. Appeals to both hardcore and casual alike. It's very much focused on the racing - there's no extra clutter. There is however, a great deal of variety in the event types and the tracks - so it's not just a boring race round circuits. Handling is excellent - very accessible for racing game newbies but deep enough to be fun and satisfying for more experienced players. Graphics are decent too - especially the lighting. But if you have an Xbox 360, then there is absolutely no reason to buy this game over Project Gotham Racing 4.			"

												GRID2 is the worst race game I've ever played, hard to believe its from the same developer as DiRT, although each iteration of dirt has got worst, wish I had stopped at dirt 2 but got and played dirt 3 as little as Grid 2. GRID 2 is just mindless street racing, with random lobbies in multyplayer your up against anyone from lvl 1 to lvl99, the only balancing to the game is that the lowest level player starts at the front, this only makes things worse as everyone else who is behind you has a faster car, one the race starts someone steers you into the wall then someone else smashes into your car spinning you round by the time you know which way your facing 2 -3 more cars smash you back into the wall, its like being inside a football rather than a car. Once everyone has passed and your moving again everyone else is out of sight, so you carry on in your crappy level 1 car possibly catching up to a few others but the leader is always gaining more ground & once they pass the finish line starts the 30 second count down, on avverage 50% of players then fail with a DNF as the race stops.    Defiantly not worth the 10 GB of hdd space it wastes.Racing games I have and highly recommend are, Screamer 2, Xpand Rally, DiRT, NSF Shift, WRC3			"

												I just finished GRID 2. I have to say that I'm a fan of it overall. They went for something different from what fans of GRID were expecting, and the drifty handling took a while to get a hold of. Yet, once I built some skill and realized what the devs were going for - a video-gamey crash and bash beautiful looking racer that takes some skill to master - I really got into it. I think, most people didn't give GRID 2 a chance. They flipped out when it wasn't exactly what they were expecting. Learning the handling is somewhat frustrating - I understand - but once I did, the game became super fun, and the racing was friggin' white knuckle right to the end. I really enjoyed my time with it, and I expect I'll return to it again sometime. There really isn't anything quite like it.			"

												The first GRID game , did the world see the games drive differently, what we are familiar , this new GRID 2 its not better than the first Grid, but also is one of the most realistic and impressive than the others racing games,  in my opinion the only things can make the first Grid games better than Grid 2, is the fact have removed the inside car camera (1° Person mode) , and you can not buy more cars, they only earn, thats make you lose the financial vision off the sponsors chalenges etc, anyway this is a highest games recommended race today.

												Having completed GRID 100%, i just had to get this new edition. Have to say Codemasters have this game to a T. There is nothing out there i can compare this game to other than its predecessor. GRID2 has been improved in a lot of ways and all positive too. If you are seeking a Racing Game with all ranges of cars from classic to modern, high detailed graphics, and epic sound, then this is a must purchase. You won't be disappointed. The is a game you can have a quick race, or you can get right into the thick of managing your sponsors, car graphics and team. Multiplayer is good, but only prefer split screen with my kids, and its great fun too.Just awesome!			"

												I purchased this game when it first released because I am (was) a huge fan of the original GRID and of CodeMasters in general. This game is, without a doubt, a disgrace to the GRID franchise.You're forced to endure a stupid storyline that focuses on social media and getting popular. The handling is absolutely awful. It is about as far from a sim as you can possibly get. I should not be able to race entire tracks and full throttle and drifting should not be as easy as it is with EVERY car in this game.Pros:+ Good GraphicsCons:+ Terrible Social Media Gimmicky Junk+ Worst vehicle handling I've ever experienced+ Damage is unrealistic+ Starting in last place in every race means at one difficulty, the game will be easy, but at one step higher, it will be impossible to win.

But neither of this can be said about GRID 2. Damn, it it pure disappointment! It definitely isn't worth paying 18 bucks for it.Anyway, it is still one of the best racing arcades on the market.To conclude: If you had fun playing GRID - don't even bother installing GRID 2, have fun playing the original game If you had never played GRID - wait for sales or promo-actions and get GRID 2 "

												This game has a lot of quick races compared to Grid and there is an arcade type of feel. It lacks the cockpit view and is a blend of NFS underground, Dirt 2, and Grid. The Dirt 2 factor is an annoying announcer and goofy menus. Where this game shines is that it smacks down every NFS title on this platform. It lacks upgrades to vehicles but that can be forgiven due to the great exhaust sounds and eye candy. If you want longer races and better handling go pick up Grid. If you want some quicker racing and some drifting this is a great game. You may even prefer the handling it's just more arcadish and you can smack your car around a bit more. The DLC is mostly just more cars and this is where your upgrades were hidden. Oh you wanted to upgrade your ride like on NFS underground well that will be $4.99. It's still a bit pricey even when bundled together but it compliments a solid title.			"

												Very dated graphics, looks like need for speed most wanted (from way back in 2005). vehicle handling model is very simple and shallow, and of course very arcade. damage simulation is very primitive and not visually impressive. sound design is adequate, but nothing special. There is nothing very wrong with this game, but nothing right either, except maybe the re-wind function. I also had a few CTDs. This really feels like a yearly refresh to a franchise where the developer is just going through the motions to maintain the quarterly revenue. Oh, and it does not even have mouse support, you have to use keyboard for every menu (no big deal, but come on!).			"

												I was pretty disappointed with this one.  It gets by as a predictable and safe arcade racer, but that's about the best to be said about it.  The graphics and effects are OK.  The story mode is less cringey than many of its counterparts, but it still holds your hand a bit more than i care for.  The controls feel like a standard, mediocre arcade racer and don't do much to excite.I have a stability issue with the game that i haven't been able to resolve, which is that it crashes without fail about 15 minutes into every play session.  Others have this issue as well, but i have yet to be able to resolve it.  The game doesn't do enough to get me to keep attempting a fix anyway.Recently, i grabbed this game's predecessor, GRID, and was shocked to find that it is a better game in practically every way.  I enjoy it's UI more, it feels better optimized, it doesn't crash, the controls feel much better, the tracks are more fun and exciting, and it's story mode is less intrusive.If you're looking for a solid arcade racer, I would definitely suggest the original GRID over this one.If you enjoy a challenge and have a decent computer, definitely consider a game like Project Cars or Assetto Corsa over this series, as they go on sale frequently and have much more to offer.

Other than the cheaters, it is a fun game online. The store page should be edited to reflect the fact there is NO VAC or any type of anti-cheat in Grid 2. I still give it a 8/10 though.

												Hi all,What can  I say? THis must be the worst excuse of a sequel I have seen in years. Technically solid with nice graphics and a lot of feel for the car, albeit very simcade-ish. But that is as far as the good goes. The bad: No real gameplay ala GRID. It's more of strung together orgy of races like Dirt or similar. No more raceteam of your own, no more spnsors to win, no more money to earn to buy cars etc etc. Grid 2 is a sub-par game. It is actually an insult to call this Grid at all. It has nothing in common with the original. Codemasters(yea I know the nameis a joke) proves yet again (after the F1 series) how able they are in dumbing down a formerly good concept and ruin the fun. Don't get me wrong, the driving is ok, but if the game around it fails then there is no purpose, no sense of achievement in actual fact there is not much left. 4/10 :(			"

												When I was 11, I bought a racing game called Gran Turismo for my Playstation Portable. Back then I couldn't tell the difference between a pickup truck and a Lamborghini (I'm exaggerating, but when it came to cars, I really did lack knowledge). I didn't have any interest of cars back then, just like every other kid, I liked Grand Theft Auto and Minecraft. Yeah that's right, I'm not afraid to tell the world that I used to like it! But after I bought that game, that one little racing game with over 800 cars, it changed my life, my perspective on how I saw the world around me. In no time, I became a car enthusiast, and switched to PC gaming. But I lost my Gran Turismo... and for 3 years I've never had a legitimate racing game. But then I bought this game. It took me a whole week to decide on buying this game. I had to break everything down, such as seeing the requirements, reading online reviews, and looking at gameplays. At first I thought to myself, ""I should probably save this game for an H1Z1 sale."" But then I thought back to Gran Tursimo days. After that, there was no stopping me from buying it. And then, after 2 hours of waiting for 6 GB to go through, while watching episodes of How I Met Your Mother... I launched it. I clicked on career mode and then I started my first race with the Ford Mustang Match 1. It was an amazing race and brought back so many memories of 11 year old me... Plus I had all the DLC for the game and had a lot of fun. Everything about this game is amazing! The graphics, the physics, the handling of the cars, it's all just so realistic! Despite the fact that this game only has a limited amount of cars everything else is amazing! And it has split-screen mode so if you want to challenge your friend to a race, you can! If you are a car enthusiast, I encourage you to get this game!			"

												The #1 Driving Simulator for the PC at present, far beyond the competition, and close behind Forza and Gran Turismo as the greatest Driving Sims ever made.Accurate cars and tracks, with excellent physics, each car has it's own charecteristics which are lost on a lot of PC driving games. Sure, it's like every other driving game, however it uses a range of tracks that aren't found in any other game, therefore keeping the game fresh and interesting.Turn the graphics up to ultra @1440p and then it really shines.

												A step down from GRID. Codemasters continue their pattern of dumbing down their racing games in GRID 2.If you want an arcade racing game with voiceovers telling you how awesome you are when you win races, a ridiculous storyline and ads being pushed in your face, then this might be the game for you.The storyline removes almost any choice you have in how you play the game. There's no element of building your garage or team, as you're essentially a hired driver.In terms of driving, before release the developers boasted about removing assists, such as traction control. This isn't true, strictly speaking. What you have instead, is traction control that's permanently on - perhaps at a slightly lower level than in GRID. This totally undermines the drifting minigame (which was quite good in GRID), which is now ""pull handbrake on corner, and wait for car to auto-correct"", essentially.Certain cars will have the rear step out given the right conditions, but broadly speaking all the cars handle the same. There is a fairly wide selection of cars, but when they're all the same and you have around 20 cars to pick from for a race, there's no point in picking any of them, except the fastest one. Additionally, there are no interior views on the cars, like in GRID.The game looks great though. The cars and scenery are well modeled, and there's a very nice lighting system. Some of the new tracks, are also quite nice.Overall however, this is an outright worse game than GRID.If you like arcade racing, the original GRID is still quite a good game, flaws and all. If you're looking for a simulator, this certainly isn't the game for you.			"

Surprisingly disappointing.I should start by saying I do plan to continue trying to play this game. I really, really want it to be good, but so far it's been frustrating to no end. The driving physics seem like they could be decent, but all the cars you get in the start are ""Drift"" class, where drift apparently means ""Absolutely no road friction."" It's seriously impossible to keep them from sliding. Now, this is bad enoungh on its own, but the A.I. is pretty much completely oblivious to your presence on the track with them, and has no qualms about ramming into you at any speed or position. Not only that, but they don't slide like you do. Ever. So instead of a crash where everyone is screwed up, they drive happily on by while you go careening off into a wall, left at the utter back of the pack. I thought we'd mastered A.I. that tries to avoid collisions in racing games, someone should really let Codemasters know. I should also note that I play with a racing wheel, so I should have the sort of fine control to avoid these things (and can in other games) but apparently that's meaningless here. I don't often ragequit games of any type, but when I do, apparently the game is GRID 2.TL:DR version:Good:-Game looks and runs great-Slick menus and dialog like most other Codemasters racing titles-Wheel support is great, you can feel the weight of the car and the road easily-Decent career modeBad-Game forces you into crappy cars with no grip-A.I. isn't subject to the same forces as you (they have seemingly infinite traction)-A.I. doesn't avoid collisions in the slightest, will run you off the road and laugh-No cockpit view (Seriously? Why?)I really, really hope I can at least get some cars with traction later into the game, but for them to force you to drive like a madman and then punish you for driving like a madman at the start of the game is stupid. Then again, Codemasters did decide that making an entire game out of the terrible Gymkhana events from DiRT 3 was a good idea... I guess they're going downhill.			"

												After I played this game for 5 months since lauch in the first day, here's what I gotGood :1. Graphics Optimization = Graphics is looks good and run great even in low settings and it's laptop friendly. my 3 years old laptop can still run this with Low-Mid settings.2. Pretty good online mode = It's great and fun to play in my opinion (if it doesn't have the terrible drivers who hit me in the first corner and annoying voice chat.)3. Variety of cars = a lot of car selection to drive.4. LiveRoutes system.5. Soundtracks.Bad :1. Cockpit camera view is missing. and this is the huge mistake.2. Too overpriced DLCs3. No text chat in online mode.4. Terrible replay cameras. and it's had the worst replays camera compared to all Codemasters racing games in the past.5. Career Mode (Can't create the team name, no teammate system, race to earn the ""fans"" ?)6. Le Mans 24 hours event is missing.7. Drift events is terrible and so boring compared to the first GRID. (and the freestyle drift and full-lap drift mode is missing too. only point-to-point drift.)8. A.I. in Single Player are too rude especially in Season 5 even you set it on medium difficulty.GRID 2 is still the fun and enjoyable racing games with the variety of cars, beautiful scenary and mix of challenges. but if compared this to the first Race Driver : GRID, this is the dissappointment sequel because a lot of great feature that in the first game doesn't featured in this sequel.7/10(Sorry for my bad english skill and grammar.)

												Race Driver: Grid is a beloved modern classic, so everyone had huge expectations for GRID 2. I myself bought it on day one...Sadly, some basic features are missing in GRID 2:- Cockpit view- Assists options (this is a huge one)- chat in online lobbies  And...The DLCs are overpriced and they further split the now small community (the game is region locked).Codemasters implemented the so called ""TrueFeel Handling System"". The handling is constant drifting on ""ice covered"" tracks, because if you keep on the non-existent racing line/not drifting you take the corners slower - ridiculous! Less cars, less liveries (most are ugly, a thing a 10 year old would put on a car)Small amount of mostly fake tracks which are very narrow, making a regular online race into a crash derby  + all that social media / ""fans"" thing  in the single player campaign... No words.You are not a racer, you are a teenage pop-star, who is given cars to drift/crash and show off to the crowds.That is what Codemasters went for.A shallow copy of Race Driver: Grid... At least they had the decency to leave out ""Race Driver"" . Good  choice, Codies.			"

												The successor of Race Driver: GRID is nowhere as good as the first game from the series but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's a bad game. It still has some really good mechanics and absolutely great looking graphics. GRID2 contains a large amount of cars with various characteristics so players with different driving styles should be able to find something for themselves. Difficulty level of the game is pretty much unbalanced because on the same level some of the challenges are way too easy and some may cause serious problems. Unfortunately, there is also a small amount of race tracks and it's easy to get bored when you have to race on the same circuit over and over again. In overall the game is good but not great. Still, it's one of the best racing games you can find on PC and it's worth to give it a shot.			"

There is incentives to drift, things that will make your post 2000 baby self giggle, Honda NSX is considered a drift car.  There is only one car that is ""GRIP"" that you can drive that makes the driving tolerable.The introduction made me want to vomit.  They tell you to drift in a RACE, they tell you how many ""cameraphones are on you,"" show your video uploaded and ""liked"" and then you get an achievemnt after a scout calls you that says ""call me maybe."" This will forever be on my record and it makes me sick.This is an arcade game for YOUTHS.  YOU RUINED THIS FOR ME!!!!!!Now back to F1 2010 for me.Oh and were you thinking of just doing a Raceday?  You have a Mustand(Drift),Challenger(Drift), randomly and Alpha Romeo(Grip THANK GOD), and a Honda NSX-R(.....drift).  Oh you were thinking that NSX-R sounded like fun it's artificially drifty, and it rockets you into walls because it thought you were starting the turn when your tail slides out at the end.

												Grid 2 is a blast to play, at first. That being said it is an outdated game that fails to live up to the hype or pedigree of its predecessor. While the controls are extremely tight (xbox360 controller) the game never truly finds its identity. With a familiar focus on youtube, much like the recent entries in the DiRT series, and a strong single player story experience, the first few hours are a gem. However, soon the driving becomes stale, pushed by the idea that every turn can be expertly drifted. Drifting is not easy and requires a delicate balance of countersteer and throttle managment, but once you've got it down it becomes second nature. You will be drifting alot. You will also be learning many of the turns very quickly. Tracks are built on just a few maps, with a few variations of the lap. There is notably a new race type where the lap changes on the fly. Its a really cool concept, but the variation is so low, after one of these races, you'll generally know map very well. Grid 2 also lacks any difficulty settings other than AI. The enviornments are gorgeous, however the cars look about as good as Need for Speed Shift 2.  The car list is populated by stellar choices, but it is very small considering what Gran Turismo and Forza have been offering for years. I also found myself unable to attach myself to any of the vehicles. Being unable to customize any performance acspects of the cars, I ended up using a car for a short time then moving on, never to return to my previous choice. While Grid 2 definitely finds itself in the middle of the sim/arcade racer spectrum, that is also my biggest gripe. Drifting is fun, but it is not the end all of racing. Maybe I've been spoiled by other racing games in the past, but I've come to expect more. More cars, more customization, more tracks, more difficulty settings, more fun. The ironic part is that the ""story"" is brilliantly done, and truly gives the player a sense of progression, which is very new to the racing genre.  Also worth noting is the inclusion of split screen, which is almost unheard of in pc gaming now.			"

												Like Race Sims but don't like all the tweaking you have to do to the cars?Like racing but your just not that good at it? This game is for you!I use to love racing on the consoles, but when I went PC the racing game are just too real. over all Race sims aren't very forgiving. Because of that I just gave then up. After reading that the  Grid series is more of a ""arcade"" game I thought I would give it a shot. I bought Grid 2 because of the number of tracks and the price. Highly recommended to thoses that just want to race and have fun.Graphicly its beutiful as well!			"

												This game is full of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Everytime you go for the race series, the game gives the last positions for you. Such as 8-12. And you just need to play aggressive to get 1st place. Well guess what, you can't. You can't because the laps are not long for that. You will get a crash a lot to chase the first three. By the way if you want to get more cars in this game you have to pay more money. Welcome to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dlc policy. Seriously don't waste your money just for the graphics cuz the only thing that is looking good in the game is the graphics. If you still want to buy a race game buy grid 1, not this.			"

												The unskippable, cringeworthy live-action films aside, there's not much wrong with this. With a keyboard it's very easy to defeat the AI, who seem to be programmed to tap the brakes unnecessarily to allow you, the human, to get past and win. All the cars in their classes (drift, grip etc.) feel the same as eachother, so no need to worry about getting used to newly unlocked cars, if you've driven one drift car you've driven them all. The graphics are fine for the age of the game, the sounds are... there, sadly the camera options are lacking & the option to turn sound down past 50% is blocked for some unknown reason, but thankfully you can turn off the repetitive voice clips.If you've played other non-serious racing games, might as well give this a shot.

												The game's dynamics are very good and very well refined for all cars of any specifications. It has a story line, which is not typical of a racing game but it is very well done so that as you complete targets and objectives the story continues and you can play the game at your own pace.If you set it to easy the races still pose a challenge perhaps not from the bots but from the game play its self, the harder difficulties offer a great challenge from the bots and forces you to better your skills.You have the option to customise your vehicles in any variation of colour with each section of the car (tags, wheels, stripes etc.), however you don't have the option to customise (add/remove) stripes etc, which is a disappointment. Also the game looks amazing with the graphics set to maximum.If you're looking for a racing game that isn't 100% realistic but will still give you a lot of realism along with some awesomely fine tuned game play I highly recommend buying GRID 2.

												GRID 2 is highly recommended for fans of the racing genre. I have thoroughly enjoyed it and I think anyone who likes the Codemasters or NFS series this should be a no brainer.PROS -- Huge variety in cars, tracks and race types- Graphics- Damage modelling- Paint job customization- Driving model- Rewind featureCONS -- No race line feature- Car spins during painting- Driving modelIf you noticed that I put the driving model as both a pro and a con, it's because really the model is subjective. It is not a 'hardcore' model like you will find in other high end racers. Nor is it too arcady. Like I said, if you enjoy NFS etc, this fits in well with those.The rewind feature is a huge step forward to reduce frustration in racing games. Ever run the perfect race only to make a small error at the last lap and get dumped to the end of the pack? That's over. Have a crash or take a corner wrong and spin out? Just rewind a few seconds and have another go at it. Feel that's cheating? Don't use it. Personally, I love the option.Cars look great, tracks look great. Track your best times and stats against your Steam friends. I haven't used the multiplayer much, but its there if that's your thing. Get bored of racing? Try the demolition derby! You'll have lots of fun with this one.			"

												This is such a good driving engine in my opinion. Similar to CMR and Dirt 1,2,3. The game has its faults but there is nothing else to beat it yet. The driving just feels right. I just tried playing NFS Shift after 150 hrs of this, and it feels like crap now. Now I just wish they would design a game campaign like Forza 4 or Gran Turismo 5, but using this graphics\physics engine. Then include tracks like Bathurst, Nurburgring\Nordschleife etc, and all the production and tuner cars like in GT. I think that would sell a million or 3!More accessable than the SimBin series, maybe not as realistic, but a lot more fun.			"

												Great Arcade racing game but not a true sequel to the original GRID in my opinion.. Yes, they've bumped up the Graphics and added more tracks, depth etc.. but it doesn't feel like a true GRID sequel due to the fact it's lacking different race categories. Where are race modes like Touge, Classic Muscle, Formula 3? Can recommend it but don't expect the same magic they've achieved with GRID.			"

												To me this game feels like it's DiRT 3 on pavement, which is exactly what I was hoping for, i'd say around 65% arcade the rest sim, the tracks and cars are awesome. GreenManGaming had this game for prepurchase for $33 with 1 DLC pack and it's worth full price. Again Codemasters EGO engine is perfect, looks gorgeous and it's smooth as butter. Multiplayer is pretty addicting and I like the unlocking system they're using, makes you ""look forward"" to more and more stuff. If you want a mix of arcade/sim racing games look into Codemasters titles, good stuff.			"

												Grid 2... is different. If you buy it expecting a similar game to grid 1 or gran turismo you might get disappointed. It's a really fun game, specially if you are into the ""Initial-D"" series, but it's not something that everyone will enjoy.Pros:-Beatiful graphics-Drifters paradise, with great physics for that-Great selection of cars-No glitches-Overall just really fun, specially multiplayerContras:-Not much of a simulator (if you are expecting that)-A lot of DLCs (almost required if you plan to play online)-No cockpit view or rearside mirror-Story mode is kinda short and not really interesting-Dumb AIIf you still have any doubts about it, here's a video that may make up your mind:

												This is a ""fun"" and good ""driving"" game with a lot of drifting, and last but not least: F*CKING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S WHO CRASHES INTO YOU ALL THE TIME IN ONLINE GAMEPLAY! WOOOHOOO! BEST THING!I like the single player, with the bots, because you can easily drift around and it is not always that hard to win and the bots are not idiots (most of the time) so they dont just bang into the side of you, and if they do, you can just use some slowmotion back in time to prevent that sh*t. In ONLINE you need to start a bit behind after you get smashed and the player who did it wont even feel that big penalty if he succed to crash you without himself crashing. He earns a bit less in impact money, but ♥♥♥♥ that sh*t.I will give this game 8/10, because it is still fun and it is better if you play it with a friend. It is one of the best car/racing games with drifting i have played (i have not played that many racing games). There is also a lot of custimazation (might have spelled that wrond) that can be done, which is great and i like that. The things i find bad in this game is, as mentioned, the stupid players in ONLINE matches. Some race fairly enough and may hit someone, but not one purpose, but then there is those f*ckers who just come with 300 km/h and bang into the side of you and if you choose to respawn, then you will probably start behind them and if you get near them again ""BANG MOTHERF*UCKER"", you have crashed again.Because of my rage i would almost give this game just 5/10 because of the people in ONLINE and the little penalty they get for crashing people, but that would be a bit unfair, because the game is not just about ONLINE and they can decide if idiots decide to play this game.I will recommend this game if you like a good drifting racer game with a lot of custimazation and i think it will be best if you play some SINGLE PLAYER before you start at playing ONLINE with high levels and crashers.Unless you like to rage and probably lose some times against crashers and high levels, then i would not recommend to play ONLINE. Of course it can be more challenging than SINGE PLAYER.			"

												After playing many hours of GRID (and also DIRT 3 made by the same company Codemasters) I decided on a whim to purchase GRID 2.  I have enjoyed the franchise so far, this second GRID game has a more arcade feel to it, but it's not enough to detract from my experience.  For those looking for a complete racing simulator, this isn't for you.  But for those looking for a fun, fast-paced racing game, look no further.  It's got a wide selection of cars which you can customize the livery and rims on.  While the tracks are limitied, it does help you with memorizing them (like real race car drivers do).  Overall, it's a fun game to burn up some time.			"

												My cable provider prevented me from watching ESPN. But thanks to GRID 2, I can now catch up with the latest news on Sportscenter.10/10 would buy again to make the cable provider♥♥♥♥♥♥his pants.EDIT: After taking 15 hrs to complete the Single Player, here's a more serious review:PROS:+ Long Single Player mode (easily 15 hrs+ if you complete every single event)+ Nice and wide selection of cars. Ranges from hypercars to the good old Silvia+ Presentation and UI. Clean and to the point with no unnecessary fuss. One thing I hate about racing games is the way they flash updates in the center of the screen. This one doesn't do that.+ Sound Design. Seriously, the best I found in a game. Engine noise changes if you lose the  exhaust and the engineer's radio transmissions become muffled when you are racing under a tunnel. Music is a bit on the relaxing and trance side which I kinda like but lacks the oomph required in a normal racing game+ Dat Red Hot brake discs tho. Nice attention to detail.CONS:- Gets repetitive.- NO COCKPIT CAM- Story is meh meh. By the time I reched Season 5 I was forcing myself to see if there was a nice ending.- Handling. Cars handle like the original GRID in drift mode. Too arcadey but I liked it for the first few hours of gameplay- Damage. The way the chassis sometimes bends with knocks and crashes is just unrealistic. After the really awesome and life like damage modelling in the original one, don't know what exactly happened here. BOTTOMLINE:Prepare yourself for a arcade game in a simulation setting to really enjoy GRID 2. There is no relation between this and the original. If you're lookin for something more motorsports career oriented like with teams you're better off with the original GRID or GRID Autosport (which is bloody awesome imho)			"

												As Grid was the greatest racing game of a generation, Codemasters has done it again by taking that greatness and reworked it as a successor from the ground up. Grid is no longer that benchmark. Grid 2 is. THIS is by far, the greatest racing game I've ever played. Pure adrenaline, high-octane action which doesn't let up until you've crossed that finish line. Make no mistake; there is NO rubberbanding from the AI in this game. You wanna win and claim 1st? FIGHT FOR IT, because the AI will work just as hard as you do to be there: Trading paint, slicing corners, braking risky turns and burning off every inch of asphalt on those treacherous straight aways.Come to think of it, this is more than a racing game. This is an experience. Just as Skyrim has done for RPGs, Grid 2 has done for racers. To oversimplify the fact: this is the Dark Souls equivalent of racing. A challenging, but extremely rewarding experience that will captivate you again and again behind every wheel of every car you take to the pavement.Incredible sound design, outstanding controls which truly make you feel like you are behind the wheel of every car you drive, and the reactive environments you race in: no two races EVER feel the same and I would be hard pressed to believe anyone who claims otherwise.If you've never played Grid, now is the time to acclimate yourself to the one and only racer that might just be the only thing truest to the form.Trust me. This is one HELL of a game!			"

												In fact, GRID 2 is like Forza Motorsport on PC - the best that we have here right now. There is not much of simulation, limited set of tracks, no cockpit view, but yet the game delivers a feeling of challenge, nice visual experience and many cars to choose from. I've never seen the first GRID, but everything of modern Need For Speed series is way behind this sequel, and I really enjoy playing it.			"

												Great tracks, great cars, great graphics. Physics is debatable, but great game overall.*Recently, there have been issues with the keys not registering/keys getting jammed. It was a common problem for users with the Logitech G110 gaming keyboard (myself included), as well as some Microsoft Sidewinder at first, but now, it's happening to my new Logitech G710+ mechanical keyboard too. It doens't happen anywhere else, so it isn't an issue with the keyboard. Until this is fixed (which I think it never will be), this game is near unplayable, because the keys WILL jam in the most vital moments of the race.**Game's too hard now.			"

												If you're looking for a racing game that's looking great, easy accessible and delivers a ton of fun right from the start, this is the game for you. It's a pure and satisfying arcade racer with imho the best xbox360 controls I've ever seen yet. The AI drivers are well balanced and tend to be more fair than aggressiv. Grid 1 was a ""crash party"" for me most of the time in this regard especially because you've got too less time to really reach the top without driving like an insane psychopath yourself. Grid 2 feels quite different, way less insane, though it becomes harder and harder to catch the #1 while you progress through the events. Still I wish (career) races would last longer with more rounds, I always have the feeling that the race is already over when it just gets really fun. (I played a few true racings sims in the past with considerably longer races, it just makes it way more intense). But this is a complaint I have with arcade racers in general besides not beeing sims anyway ;-)Missing cockpits - everyone has them today, even arcade racers. But the game is still pretty fun without them.DLC, way to go today it seems. Questionable but I'm to tired to get upset. Take it or leave it.			"

												Grid 2... is different. If you buy it expecting a similar game to grid 1 or gran turismo you might get disappointed. It's a really fun game, specially if you are into the ""Initial-D"" series, but it's not something that everyone will enjoy.Pros:-Beatiful graphics-Drifters paradise, with great physics for that-Great selection of cars-No glitches-Overall just really fun, specially multiplayerContras:-Not much of a simulator (if you are expecting that)-A lot of DLCs (almost required if you plan to play online)-No cockpit view or rearside mirror-Story mode is kinda short and not really interesting-Dumb AIIf you still have any doubts about it, here's a video that may make up your mind:

												This is a ""fun"" and good ""driving"" game with a lot of drifting, and last but not least: F*CKING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S WHO CRASHES INTO YOU ALL THE TIME IN ONLINE GAMEPLAY! WOOOHOOO! BEST THING!I like the single player, with the bots, because you can easily drift around and it is not always that hard to win and the bots are not idiots (most of the time) so they dont just bang into the side of you, and if they do, you can just use some slowmotion back in time to prevent that sh*t. In ONLINE you need to start a bit behind after you get smashed and the player who did it wont even feel that big penalty if he succed to crash you without himself crashing. He earns a bit less in impact money, but ♥♥♥♥ that sh*t.I will give this game 8/10, because it is still fun and it is better if you play it with a friend. It is one of the best car/racing games with drifting i have played (i have not played that many racing games). There is also a lot of custimazation (might have spelled that wrond) that can be done, which is great and i like that. The things i find bad in this game is, as mentioned, the stupid players in ONLINE matches. Some race fairly enough and may hit someone, but not one purpose, but then there is those f*ckers who just come with 300 km/h and bang into the side of you and if you choose to respawn, then you will probably start behind them and if you get near them again ""BANG MOTHERF*UCKER"", you have crashed again.Because of my rage i would almost give this game just 5/10 because of the people in ONLINE and the little penalty they get for crashing people, but that would be a bit unfair, because the game is not just about ONLINE and they can decide if idiots decide to play this game.I will recommend this game if you like a good drifting racer game with a lot of custimazation and i think it will be best if you play some SINGLE PLAYER before you start at playing ONLINE with high levels and crashers.Unless you like to rage and probably lose some times against crashers and high levels, then i would not recommend to play ONLINE. Of course it can be more challenging than SINGE PLAYER.			"

												This is such a good driving engine in my opinion. Similar to CMR and Dirt 1,2,3. The game has its faults but there is nothing else to beat it yet. The driving just feels right. I just tried playing NFS Shift after 150 hrs of this, and it feels like crap now. Now I just wish they would design a game campaign like Forza 4 or Gran Turismo 5, but using this graphics\physics engine. Then include tracks like Bathurst, Nurburgring\Nordschleife etc, and all the production and tuner cars like in GT. I think that would sell a million or 3!More accessable than the SimBin series, maybe not as realistic, but a lot more fun.			"

												The game's dynamics are very good and very well refined for all cars of any specifications. It has a story line, which is not typical of a racing game but it is very well done so that as you complete targets and objectives the story continues and you can play the game at your own pace.If you set it to easy the races still pose a challenge perhaps not from the bots but from the game play its self, the harder difficulties offer a great challenge from the bots and forces you to better your skills.You have the option to customise your vehicles in any variation of colour with each section of the car (tags, wheels, stripes etc.), however you don't have the option to customise (add/remove) stripes etc, which is a disappointment. Also the game looks amazing with the graphics set to maximum.If you're looking for a racing game that isn't 100% realistic but will still give you a lot of realism along with some awesomely fine tuned game play I highly recommend buying GRID 2.

												GRID 2 is highly recommended for fans of the racing genre. I have thoroughly enjoyed it and I think anyone who likes the Codemasters or NFS series this should be a no brainer.PROS -- Huge variety in cars, tracks and race types- Graphics- Damage modelling- Paint job customization- Driving model- Rewind featureCONS -- No race line feature- Car spins during painting- Driving modelIf you noticed that I put the driving model as both a pro and a con, it's because really the model is subjective. It is not a 'hardcore' model like you will find in other high end racers. Nor is it too arcady. Like I said, if you enjoy NFS etc, this fits in well with those.The rewind feature is a huge step forward to reduce frustration in racing games. Ever run the perfect race only to make a small error at the last lap and get dumped to the end of the pack? That's over. Have a crash or take a corner wrong and spin out? Just rewind a few seconds and have another go at it. Feel that's cheating? Don't use it. Personally, I love the option.Cars look great, tracks look great. Track your best times and stats against your Steam friends. I haven't used the multiplayer much, but its there if that's your thing. Get bored of racing? Try the demolition derby! You'll have lots of fun with this one.			"

												Great Arcade racing game but not a true sequel to the original GRID in my opinion.. Yes, they've bumped up the Graphics and added more tracks, depth etc.. but it doesn't feel like a true GRID sequel due to the fact it's lacking different race categories. Where are race modes like Touge, Classic Muscle, Formula 3? Can recommend it but don't expect the same magic they've achieved with GRID.			"

												Its got your typical NFS style arcade racing gameplay. The graphics and tracks are stunning, the damage on cars is realistic as it gets. Just staring at the cars itself worth the game, the amount of attention to detail is great. The only con would be that it gets a bit repetitive even though it actually has a variety of race modes, don't expect to have a storyline that keeps you hooked either. It has a season style racing career just like Forza series on the Xbox. Very few people who play this game online as well. Overall a 7/10			"

												I'm glad I at least got the game with the DLC pack when it was on sale. Aside from that, the game itself is not worth more than $5. Let me elaborate; enlighten you if you will. Lol. The menu is disorderly. It feels like you are sitting through a loading screen every time you want to switch from, among other things, gamemodes such as Time Attack, Elimination, or customizing your car, which, by the way, is very limited. I've been playing for a while and all it seems I can do is choose a couple of sponsors (no, not unlock aftermarket parts), change the pattern / colour of my vehicle and the wheels. I dislike the fact that you are forced to drive different, garbage, stock vehicles. You can't invest heavily into a single car. To me, this makes all the difference. Multiplayer is a completely separate thing in itself. I've yet to find out what the money I'm earning is for. I mean when you start SP, you work your way to the top. In MP, regardless of your not being able to choose a vehicle for a race because you haven't went that far, you're still able to race with it. This feels weird as you're not accustomed to flying a jet in SP. The tracks all feel the same. The visuals, handling of the car and graphics are quite pleasing on the other hand. I'd recommend this game if you're looking for leisure, kick back with friends and play on a steering-wheel kind of thing.			"

It was a common problem for users with the Logitech G110 gaming keyboard (myself included), as well as some Microsoft Sidewinder at first, but now, it's happening to my new Logitech G710+ mechanical keyboard too. It doens't happen anywhere else, so it isn't an issue with the keyboard. Until this is fixed (which I think it never will be), this game is near unplayable, because the keys WILL jam in the most vital moments of the race.**Game's too hard now.			"

												If you're looking for a racing game that's looking great, easy accessible and delivers a ton of fun right from the start, this is the game for you. It's a pure and satisfying arcade racer with imho the best xbox360 controls I've ever seen yet. The AI drivers are well balanced and tend to be more fair than aggressiv. Grid 1 was a ""crash party"" for me most of the time in this regard especially because you've got too less time to really reach the top without driving like an insane psychopath yourself. Grid 2 feels quite different, way less insane, though it becomes harder and harder to catch the #1 while you progress through the events. Still I wish (career) races would last longer with more rounds, I always have the feeling that the race is already over when it just gets really fun. (I played a few true racings sims in the past with considerably longer races, it just makes it way more intense). But this is a complaint I have with arcade racers in general besides not beeing sims anyway ;-)Missing cockpits - everyone has them today, even arcade racers. But the game is still pretty fun without them.DLC, way to go today it seems. Questionable but I'm to tired to get upset. Take it or leave it.			"

It's a really fun game, specially if you are into the ""Initial-D"" series, but it's not something that everyone will enjoy.Pros:-Beatiful graphics-Drifters paradise, with great physics for that-Great selection of cars-No glitches-Overall just really fun, specially multiplayerContras:-Not much of a simulator (if you are expecting that)-A lot of DLCs (almost required if you plan to play online)-No cockpit view or rearside mirror-Story mode is kinda short and not really interesting-Dumb AIIf you still have any doubts about it, here's a video that may make up your mind:

												If you're just the average gamer looking for a fun racing game, this is a great option.  The physics aren't ultra realistic like racing simulators, but they're better than the basic arcade games like Need for Speed or Burnout.  It can be extremely challenging to nail a corner perfect, but the cars are very forgiving if you make mistakes.  If you like the DiRT games, there's a good chance you'll enjoy the Grid games too.

												Grid 2 (stylised as GRID 2 and known as Race Driver: Grid 2 in Japan) is a racing video game developed and published by Codemasters and is the sequel to 2008's Race Driver: Grid. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.The game includes numerous real world locations and cities such as Paris. It also includes motor vehicles spanning four decades. In addition, it includes a new handling system that developer Codemasters has dubbed 'TrueFeel', which aims to hit a sweet spot between realism and accessibility. Races do not include a first person cockpit view.Drivers are given certain cars before some race modes, and can unlock others through other vehicle challenges. Car liveries can be customised by the player, using preset graphic designs adapted with colours or varying shades.			"

												Fun physics, not a sim at all, about as easy as Need for Speed games. And like those games it doesn't take itself too seriously.For instance the AI tries to murder you. Usually it's not a problem, but some drivers won't hesitate to let you drive off a cliff. And the camera is low to the ground which means you can't see anything but bumper if you're behind somebody and it also means you can't see the next turn. Makes you feel like you're going fast, even though you'll miss the next corner if you don't know the track. You can switch to hood cam, but then you don't get a visual representation of the smallest bumps in the road which have an IMMENSE effect on the handling of certain cars on certain tracks. So that's not an option either.It also promotes to ignore all techniques you've ever learned, ignore the racing line, ignore braking points, ignore weight shifts and just go flat out all the time and drift around every single corner. Using proper techniques will make you go slower. But if you have a track in the mountains suddenly you have to keep in mind how driving uphill and downhill has an effect on the weight shifts and steering which is really hard compared to the NFS-style of racing you had used in the previous race. And in those races all of a sudden 1 wheel on the grass means guaranteed spin-out. This game can't decide whether it's a serious racing game or not and this inconsistency makes the difficult races much more difficult then they need to be. Both the sim races and the arcade races are fun, but it's not fun if you can't tell in advance what you'll get, can't pick a car to suit that style of race and you have to flip a switch and drive differently. Especially if the enemies keep trying to do PIT manoeuvres on you. They'll even ram you during a Drift event which makes no sense.Another strange inconsistency is the track times you need to finish first. If you finish in say 2 minutes flat you might win the one time, but the next time you play the same races you might encounter much faster enemies and you'll have to do it 5 seconds quicker. If it's random, what's the point of having to be first? Just give us a set time goal. AI aggressiveness is random as well.The Flashback option is confusing. You can use it quite a bit and then suddenly not anymore, so use it wisely because there is no way to tell how long or how often you can use it. Sometimes you can use it 8 times, but it's also been disabled after about 3 uses. The game tells you it exists and what key activates it in the very first race and then no more information ever. Maybe so it stays a bit of a gamble.All in all... It's usually fun, it's random, it's aggressive, it's adrenaline filled, if you don't care about it being a little unfair at times (scripted crashes happen in front of you, AI tries to murder you) and don't take racing too seriously you'll probably like this. Personally I still like TOCA 3 a lot better. It doesn't have better mechanics, but at least it's not all randomness and I didn't have to follow a career path that suits a very boring story. If this game would have been consistent and if they would have made a proper hood camera I would have loved this, but they made it unnecessarily frustrating. The physics and vehicles are mostly awesome, but the rest seems rushed. Most people will like it I think, this is how race games often are nowadays.			"

												So I noticed today that GRID 2 was free on steam for the next two days. I haven't played any racing games in a while, and figured I would give this one a shot. So after waiting for it to download, and the lengthy load time - I see a cut scene of chicago that takes like 3 minutes to run through, until it finally zoomed into the car and then froze. Had to try to CTRL+ALT+DEL and kill the task, which did not work. It still said it was opened and froze everything on that monitor, thankfully I have two monitors. I get my computer to the point I see that everything else I try to open freezes as well and it will not kill the task, so it looks like restarting the system is my only option. Tell my system to restart and the windows restart comes up, and tells me that it needs to force steam (grid) to close. Fine. System restart then locks up as well. Ugh, this is the first game to freeze my system in well over a year. I think to myself, well that was annoying glitch, lets try this again. GOD DAMMIT SAME THING HAPPENS. 20 minutes later, I think I'm just uninstalling this bad boy. Kudos to being the first game to ever lock up my system so horribly though.			"

												Astonishingly good game for a small outlay. As far as car games go its great, but don't expect and simulator style physics or options from ricer games. It fits into a small type of game that's out there for racing fans who just want the fun racing and nothing to serious. Also make sure you get the DLCs cos they are great!			"

												The unskippable, cringeworthy live-action films aside, there's not much wrong with this. With a keyboard it's very easy to defeat the AI, who seem to be programmed to tap the brakes unnecessarily to allow you, the human, to get past and win. All the cars in their classes (drift, grip etc.) feel the same as eachother, so no need to worry about getting used to newly unlocked cars, if you've driven one drift car you've driven them all. The graphics are fine for the age of the game, the sounds are... there, sadly the camera options are lacking & the option to turn sound down past 50% is blocked for some unknown reason, but thankfully you can turn off the repetitive voice clips.If you've played other non-serious racing games, might as well give this a shot.

												The game's dynamics are very good and very well refined for all cars of any specifications. It has a story line, which is not typical of a racing game but it is very well done so that as you complete targets and objectives the story continues and you can play the game at your own pace.If you set it to easy the races still pose a challenge perhaps not from the bots but from the game play its self, the harder difficulties offer a great challenge from the bots and forces you to better your skills.You have the option to customise your vehicles in any variation of colour with each section of the car (tags, wheels, stripes etc.), however you don't have the option to customise (add/remove) stripes etc, which is a disappointment. Also the game looks amazing with the graphics set to maximum.If you're looking for a racing game that isn't 100% realistic but will still give you a lot of realism along with some awesomely fine tuned game play I highly recommend buying GRID 2.

												GRID 2 is highly recommended for fans of the racing genre. I have thoroughly enjoyed it and I think anyone who likes the Codemasters or NFS series this should be a no brainer.PROS -- Huge variety in cars, tracks and race types- Graphics- Damage modelling- Paint job customization- Driving model- Rewind featureCONS -- No race line feature- Car spins during painting- Driving modelIf you noticed that I put the driving model as both a pro and a con, it's because really the model is subjective. It is not a 'hardcore' model like you will find in other high end racers. Nor is it too arcady. Like I said, if you enjoy NFS etc, this fits in well with those.The rewind feature is a huge step forward to reduce frustration in racing games. Ever run the perfect race only to make a small error at the last lap and get dumped to the end of the pack? That's over. Have a crash or take a corner wrong and spin out? Just rewind a few seconds and have another go at it. Feel that's cheating? Don't use it. Personally, I love the option.Cars look great, tracks look great. Track your best times and stats against your Steam friends. I haven't used the multiplayer much, but its there if that's your thing. Get bored of racing? Try the demolition derby! You'll have lots of fun with this one.			"

This game is for you!I use to love racing on the consoles, but when I went PC the racing game are just too real. over all Race sims aren't very forgiving. Because of that I just gave then up. After reading that the  Grid series is more of a ""arcade"" game I thought I would give it a shot. I bought Grid 2 because of the number of tracks and the price. Highly recommended to thoses that just want to race and have fun.Graphicly its beutiful as well!			"

 Positive + With a different career experience this time ‘round, the more story-focused single-player feels a lot more fleshed out than its predecessor. Feeling like a driving personality rather than a member of a team makes the solo experience much more memorable and charming. Clocking in at around 11 hours, the career mode is easily long enough to satisfy gamers who enjoy a bit of character with their driving experience+ Again, just like the first game, the handling strikes the perfect balance between simulation and arcade. While I will admit there is a bit more of a learning curve when it comes to oversteering (especially when it comes to drift events), and less customisation when it comes to driving assists, there’s still no denying that the driving is as fun as ever+ Different to the first game however, this game seems to focus a bit more on street circuits, as a lot of the newly added tracks take place in city streets rather than strictly closed-off racing circuits. This does give the game a slightly more arcade aesthetic than the previous game, but for me it didn’t really detract from the experience at all (though people who prefer simulation games may be put off by this)+ Compared to its predecessor, the graphics here are a definite step up. Every positive graphical aspect that was in the first game has been touched up and been given even more polish (though the bloom effect is a tad excessive). Negative - While the game does have a lengthy career, compared to the first game, there is a noticeable lack of variety in the courses. While the game does add a good amount of new tracks, it also reuses quite a lot from the previous game, which does hurt the total amount of different and unique tracks that you can race on- The same audio problem that existed in the first game is still present here, in terms of the in-game dialogue getting boring and repetitive. If that was an issue for you before, not much has changed unfortunately (though I do prefer the voice actor more so this time around). Worth Mentioning • Codemasters decided to remove the in-car view in this entry of the series. Personally, I have never used this view in a driving game, so the absence of this did not phase me at all. However, if you are the sort of person who does play their driving games using that view, then you will be disappointed in this aspect (though there is a community mod that adds an in-car view if you want to check that out first). Verdict “Just like its predecessor, GRID 2 is another highly enjoyable and fun racing game. While some people may be put off by the game feeling more arcade-like than the first one, for me, it didn’t deter me from playing the game at all. Another great driving experience!” 8.5/10 TJBs  "

												My note: 7/10 - It's a very decent game. I'm having quite some fun with it. A bit different from the first one, but I woudn't say it's worse. It's easier and it feels easier (but not that easy) but, on the other hand, it's not so frustrating so it makes it a fun game to play both offline and online. I'd say it is not as serious as the original GRID was. It's a more casual experience that in my opinion isn't neither better, or worse. As stated before, just different with the same amount of quality. Graphics are nice aswell. If you like car racing games, try the demo as I did before buying it and decide for yourself.			"

												I waited a while with getting the game, partly because of the original price, all the DLC (and the promise of more), no cockpit-view and no sign of stuff that made the original GRID special game it was (like destruction derby) I waited for the game to go on sale and bought it and haven't regretted it. The stuff I was hesistant about were nullified. The DLC isn't nescecarry since the base game gives you enough cars/tracks to enjoy yourself and with the sale the DLC weren't that pricey. No cockpit-view is a setback from the original, however I never really used it... There is still the bonnet view and for me that suffices, al though I can understand that the people who did play in cockpit-view are let down. Destruction derby was added as free DLC.Now about the game itself. It is absolutely stunning. Not only the cars like in all racing cars, but everything... From the stylised menus to trees alongside the track. The physics are different from the original, but it still got the nice blend of arcade and sim. Where GRID was packed full of oversteer, GRID 2 actually has realistic understeer from time to time and changed the drift mechanic. It's not hard to get used to and shouldn't bother you if you're not that much of a sim-driver (If you are... why get GRID or GRID2 in the first place?) Variaty in cars is ever present. The focus on brands shifted a bit, we see a lot more Mercs/Jags in the game however the most awesome car in the world the Nissan GTR still has a big role in the game (with the DLC you have 4 kinds of GTR awesomeness). All with all I can say that Codemasters is back on tracks with games like Dirt3 and GRID2 and we should just forget games like Showdown ever existed.			"

Negative - While the game does have a lengthy career, compared to the first game, there is a noticeable lack of variety in the courses. While the game does add a good amount of new tracks, it also reuses quite a lot from the previous game, which does hurt the total amount of different and unique tracks that you can race on- The same audio problem that existed in the first game is still present here, in terms of the in-game dialogue getting boring and repetitive. If that was an issue for you before, not much has changed unfortunately (though I do prefer the voice actor more so this time around). Worth Mentioning • Codemasters decided to remove the in-car view in this entry of the series. Personally, I have never used this view in a driving game, so the absence of this did not phase me at all. However, if you are the sort of person who does play their driving games using that view, then you will be disappointed in this aspect (though there is a community mod that adds an in-car view if you want to check that out first). Verdict “Just like its predecessor, GRID 2 is another highly enjoyable and fun racing game. While some people may be put off by the game feeling more arcade-like than the first one, for me, it didn’t deter me from playing the game at all. Another great driving experience!” 8.5/10 TJBs  "

												Not bad. I got it on sale and Im glad I tried this before buying the newer and more expensive Grid: Autosport. This is more of an arcade style racer than a simulator. When I think racing simulator I instantly think Gran Tourismo or even Assetto Corsa. Its still a great game but the only tweaking you will be doing to your car is placing sponsor decals and other aesthetics.All in all, its fairly easy to play. Newcomers to driving games can probably master the controls very soon while seasoned racers will be able to come in and start with a bang. One thing I love, is there seem to be a lot of short races. I was (and still am) a Gran Tourismo junkie. But what I always hated about taht game was in order to complete 100% of the game you had to do the extremely long, marathon style races. Some take hours and hours to finish. Im not sure if Grid has any of those but it doesnt seem to be that type of game. GT only has them because it tries to be a true simulator.Im not crazy about the focus on drifting with every single car/class. While I dont mind drifting, I think drifting capable cars (and those amde jsut for drifting) fall into a different class than all of the other cars available. Matter of fact, drift cars and that style of racing, belongs to a small minority. But in most racing games now, they tend to add drifting into the game no matter tha car or track style. Well, thats not always the best way to drive a track. Also, your car type really matters when it comes to sliding around. In Grid, so far, Ive even been expected to drift an old Dodge Charger in a ""takeover"" style race while simultaneously racing against a clock. Well, I may be sliding the rear-end out to get around some turns, but Im not going to be holding a full-on drift. The car is too heavy, tires spin too much, and I wouldnt be able to accelerate out of the turn enough to make up for lost time in the drift. But then here is what makes it an arcade racer and not a simulator...my acceleration and grip coming out the turn (while drifting) was perfectly fine. A real simulator wouldnt allow that to occur.As an Arcade style racer its great. When properly placed into the category I literally have no complaints. Due to certain graphics and the fact that some of the menu layouts are poor, I would give this an 8/10 in the arcade racer category.			"

												THis game has its problems with Windows 10. It is standard racing as so many others, and as this is the case, there is a logical conclusion considering the trouble it causes to get it to run, i.e. not to recommend it at any rate. It can take a lot of time to adjust the GPU to GRID 2, what should be done automatically and correctly, but isn't on Windows 10. Asking the developers, they do not intend to make a patch. After a while, even if the GPU is fine with Windows 10 then, the sound may still be stuttering and terribly irritating,  kind of terror for the ears. As has been said before, there are a lot of very similar games out there. Better catching those.			"

												I will give this title a fair rating and even though i liked the play through there are some cons that can not be overlooked.- Fanboys seem to downvote anything negative. Just same as COD or Miscreated, it destroys a fair trial- Overimpressive physics: Or did you think you can give a car a 13 times side spin when hitting the wall in Hong kong before touching the ground. Also whenever you hit the side, Rocks won't stop you but signs can send you flinging around. - Sloppy controls: My G27 wheel and my Xbox controller show 15°+ dead angle, which is nowadays impossible in cars.   If there is a game where it does not matter what you use to play with, then this one.- Drifting mechanic: Some cars just will slide like crazy and others stick to the ground like Carrera cars and still it has nothing to do with aerodynamics, weight or which wheel is driven.- Generally funny behaivor of actual super cars that have to go slower in corners than a 40 year old car, specially seen at the Koenigsegg Agrea R, which is plain unraceable (similar to Testdrive 2)- Repetetive Tracks with around 12 Locations, where many corners got copied several times (Chicago, Miami, ...)- Too expensive DLCs with mostly only slightly tuned cars from those which are already in. Any DLC car can be ignored for racing either in carreer or online. - Unfair competition as the AI seem not to care or see the player and rams it, sending only the player to fling around or being highly damaged.- AI seem not to compete with each other and does only change the average speed with different setting but not the actual skill.- Online multiplayer is already quite deadHere some good stuff:+ Acknowledged my G27 racing wheel but only with semi automatic+ Lovely made cars and generally good graphics+ Story mode feels very tempting and rewarding+ No endless trials thanks to time line, variable difficulty, run backs, no economy,...+ Split screen multiplayer is getting rare nowadaysAnyway get this on sale without DLCs then you can enjoy some hours, as this is one of the never ending arcarde racers that can really be a pain once you'll get to it's end.

												I know I've only played a tiny portion of the game at just 10 hours, but I am confident I can give it a glowing review right this split second.It's amazing. Absolutely, truly. A real finisher!This is coming from someone who has stayed away from racing games for the better portion of the last 25 years. Why? Because I hate 'timers' in games... and what is a race? mostly timers! However this game may have some timers (the checkpoint races I 'just' started are a bit annoying), they are in no way abusive like how 'other' games do timers. So here I am feeling stupid and sheepish for staying away from racing games due to that. ANYHOW...There is so much variety in this. Different kinds of races and events and locations. So many different kinds of cars, some of which I have quickly found suck (I'm looking at you crystler and mazda)! While some are just so in sync with me that I'm ripping up the events (oh my volkswagon I'm in love)! Its just great.To top it all off, this game absolutely roars on my system. I have that 144hz monitor, and this game never hitches a single frame off 144fps at max detail. Its absolutely gorgeous and smooth, making it so intense I feel like I'm there! I began playing in the 3rd person behind the car mode, because I had wanted to see my car and others nearby. But then I switched to hoodcam (where you see the hood), and my effectivity increased insanely... I was drifting tight corners and barely running into anything. It was night and day. Its awesome the game has the choice! Some games force you to their way or the highway, no pun intended.If you dont already have this game, and even if you are not a racing game fan... I say get this. Its a blast!			"

In the game are many cars, but when you click to the car, you will see message, to buy DLC with this car - it was like in F2P. And driving model was like you drive a boat. No sorry...			"

												I DO recommend this, but DONT go into this thinking its a sim! The handling is very unrealistic, in contrast with the graphics.The handling model is very far from a sim, unlike the original Race Driver Grid and sequel Grid Autosport, which are both somewhat simlike, but still very accessible.If you know what you're getting into (ie. an arcade racer), there's nothing to stop you having a great time. Yes, the quickest way round a corner is drifting with the back-end almost overtaking you, which is quite an odd sensation due to the very realistic and beautiful visuals, especially in something like the track oriented Caterham SP/300.R.

												If you are looking for a game with good steering wheel support this is not the game to buy. The steering is way to sensitive and when you try and counter-steer with the wheel when the game forces you to drift every turn, you wil spin out or swerve back and forth several times until hitting a wall. I've been playing racing games for the past 11 years, and I would rather play a game from 2006.			"

												I'm very disappointed by this game. But first the good parts:- graphics are quite good and the game runs smoohly on my low-end gaming notebook- sound is quite good too- controls and drifts are quite nice. you have to get used to it I guess. It's challenging, but doable.Bad parts- no story (except ""ok, go drive and make fame"")- no characters (except their voices.. but you never ever see a human being but the crowds behind their fences)- rewind option. you need this a lot. every time an opponent hits you you have a 50% change to do a 180 turn. And the feature is no fun at all. You think undoing your failures makes the game more entertaining? no, it doesn't. you get a second chance and screw up again -> rewind -> try again. yay...- menu. there's not much wrong with the menu, but there's just so much clutter and so many confirmation dialogs you'll learn to confirm without even thinking about it.- no tuning (in career)- no freakin' camera view of the car while painting it or changing the wheels?! (the only parts you can change) REALLY?! i tried mouse, the race-view keys. NADA. how am i supposed to chose a paint without seeing the FKin car?			"

												OK, so let me tell you about the one aspect of GRID 2 that was irritating enough for me to stop playing it for a few weeks, and then when I came back to it, irritating enough, again, to uninstall it for good.I am well aware that pretty much every racing game uses ""tournament"" modes to prolong gameplay hours.That's fine with me.But GRID 2 takes that concept to a ridiculous level.You have the Touge and Faceoff ""tournaments"".Here's how they work:You need to win a 1-on-1 race. Three times in a row. On the SAME EXACT TRACK.I will not really even try to explain here why this is NOT a tournament mode, but merely a ""hey, you know what's fun? beating the same race, three times in a row"" brainfart of an idea someone came up with at a design meeting and walked away really proud of themselves.So yes, I'm thumbing this game down in my review because of this very idea, which in my personal opinion, completely broke the otherwise nearly-perfect arcade racer for me.

												Just bought on special, wish I had not bothered. I am sure if you stick with it you can get some enjoyment out of it, but for me I if dont gel with the experience fairly rapidly its all over and after half hour fannying about with it, I hate it.Such as, jumps you right into a race, no chance to check your options for graphics etc, which I find pretty weird to be honest, so I had to wait untl the 'it takes forever' intros and long winded cut scenes at the start of the game/race, none of which I managed to avoid or kill, then wait for the race to start, and then pause the race just to modify options such as resolutions, vsync etc...very crappy...Controls, supremely crappy, its way way way, way, too slippy out there, and I play Dirt 3 so I dont mind some drifting, but this was just ridiculous, and of course, at this stage (dont know if you can later on) there is no obvious way to modify the vehicle setup so you can at least try to get it to work with the way you like drive in game.Other stuff that started to annoy me, what a load of long winded blah blah blah from the commentary about how you can youtube your progress and how awesome you are, blah blah blah blah, blah blah blah, no obvious way to stop it in game, I just wanted to say please please just shut up and sod off, an option to just cut past the scene/voiceover by pressing esc or something would be fantastic, but couldnt find one and kept pressing any buttons on my controller and keyboard in the hope could kill the story teller. Also I didnt do the raceday, which you are offered right after doing the first race, and being told how awesome you are even if you♥♥♥♥♥♥it up, and despite this, the game still behaved like I had done it, and numbed me yet again with some more background chat and story telling blah blah blah, blah blah blah, for gods sake please please please shut up and go away...Ooh and of course theres the crashing, and I dont mean into other cars, I mean program, just stops working and you find yourself dumped back out onto your desktop...Theres just so much i dislike about this experience at the outset that I just dont want to play it again, I could probably get used to all the drifting, but whats the point, I may as well just play a rally style game, and I just cant bear the thought of having to go through all that mind numbing commentary, what an utter waste of cash and an hour of my time...and did I mention it crashes too? Maybe autosport is better, i dont know, but im not wasting my cash on it to find out.Some folks obviously get on ok with this game and enjoy it, not for me though...I should have spent the cash on a mighty bucket for one...Ive requested a refund as I just cannot bring myself to try it again...

												Okay here we goPC Port:The PC Port is amazing! There is a reason that in a lot of graphics card benchmarks they use Grid 2, the game is optimized very well on PC. I've had no issues, no crashes, no Games for Windows Live, no issues with menus or anything at all. Grid 2 is an example of a PC port done right!The Game:You start in a little garage with no fans or anything, then you have to get better, gain more fans and then you'll get a better garage! I really enjoy the progression in this game and it had me hooked for hours.A lot of people complain about how the cars handle compared to Grid 1, in fact almost everyone complains about that.I haven't played Grid 1 but I really like the Grid 2 handling. Obviously the cars dont handle realisticly or anything like that but they're very much fun to drive in. For its price this game is an amazing PC Racing game! You should defenetly check it out.  "

Asides from the core components being present, and the game being built very well, I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the game that I played. Great racing game, will be buying GRID 3 for sure.			"

												Like most games coming out of Codemasters in the past years it's a bland product.Everything is dumbed down, great features removed leaving you feeling a bit lackluster.This is a very good looking piece of turd. Shiny and shapely but still have a bad stench around it.I knew I shouldn't have bought it and yet I did. I promised myself back in 2009 with the horrendous release of Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising, promising and advertising game critical functions that wasn't in the released product.Yet I have bought worse and worse versions of F1 and Dirt.Let codemasters release their crap for kids on consoles but as for delivering a good PC game, thats over and done with.Also DLC!! Are you for real, most if not all of that♥♥♥♥♥♥should be in the game from the start. 64Euros worth of DLC for a 40euro game should be punishable under some better business act or something.Stay away from codemasters and their 100euro products, support 10 indie developers instead!

												One of the best arcade racing games I've ever played. With a gaympad. I don't understand how people play arcade racers with wheels but that's just me.Despite all its problems/omissions/dlc overload mentioned in other reviews.But all those dlcs begs the question - where the sexual intercourse is cockpit dlc?!Warning: Random public multiplayer lobbies may contain individuals more toxic than Adolf Hitler in April 1945.So if you're new into multiplayer pc games and don't have enough (e-)friends to play with, be prepared for possible occurence of some really sad, pathetic cheaters and griefers going full-re-turd.But from my experience, most players are just fine and won't intentionally ram you like brainless morons.Yeah, and there are some obvious balancing issues which from some unexplicable *cough*lazy devs*cough* have never been fixed - in each tier, a few cars are objectively much faster/better, so I'd suggest you read some guides before spending your in-game currency.

												No, my screen name was not based off this game. It never was or is. My recent interests in cars and all that further makes my screen name fitting, but that wasn't the original intent.Grid 2 is decent. It starts off strong. Amazing intro, right into action, with orchestrated and epic soundtrack pulsing as you pound the track in an old Mustang. Your handler can say your first name, out loud, from a list of common names. He says cool things while you're cornering... Heads up on collisions, or remembers that you need to work on sector 3 of the track. The damage effects are bland but get the job done. The graphics are fantastic. The style of the game is awesome. But it gets entirely bland about as fast as the races become.Grid doesn't know what it wants to be. You get Drift events, Japanese Domestics everyone loves like the Silvia and Fairlady Z.... You get some muscle... You get a slathering of European, German... And then suddenly, karts. Boring ♥♥♥♥ing Formula style cars. I hate the British love of motorsports with a passion. It has no soul. It has 0 anything interesting. It's boring and lame. And little Caterhams are ugly, and boring. Sadly, Grid 2 loves the British take on motorsports... And quickly the awesome Chicago, Miami and Curvey Japanese tracks give way to ugly, bland boring night time race-maps... They offer you a Jaguar, the almighty SLS AMG of course, the most boring and ugly Mclaren, and most European only vehicles by the time you're in Tier 3... But good luck winning any races if you do not pick the stupid karts to race alongside them. That is a gigantic slap in the face. I like racing to be a test of REAL road cars and what a man or woman can do within a realistic, mostly every-day type vehicle. Track-only specific cars are ugly, boring, and honestly in my opinion an extremely lame lifestyle to pursue if that is your interest. And that's the issue. Grid 2 can't decide whether it wants you in the grounded, fun street race-style cars or in full on boring F1 style races. And in the middle it forces you to put both on the table at the same time, much to frustration and misery as one of the obnoxious AI is 6 seconds ahead of you in his little lame kart because you wanted to break the back-end out on the Jaguar. +Starts off strong+Fun handling and racing in the first 2 tiers+Great graphics+Epic soundtrack+A great overall presentation-Turns into F1 style kart racing quickly-Puts Caterham track karts agains full sedans in Tier 3, creating a gigantic rift-Forces you to drive karts to win-Tiniest selection of vehicles, a smattering of some greats, with little to no character-Lush lighting and car visuals give way to the ugliest track renders I've ever seen outside of the Japanese, Chicago and Miami tracks...-Can't decide whether you should drift, or keep it tight, the handling model in the game appears to give up and surprises you on every corner.In terms of the whole package i'd say the game is a solid 6/10. Great graphics, great racing. The ""car culture"" style is nowhere to be found... Sterile and as dull as a doctors office... The game swerves from a great showing to Formula 1 style quick, sapping the fun and life out of the genre while beating laptimes over your head. Blech. "

												Months after release, the most active forum thread is one in which the screen keeps flashing black. Seems to mostly affect NVidia GPUs. Unfortunately, it affected me.  Steams ""opposite of the customer is always right"" no-return policy should come with a ""publishers need to be responsive to bug reports"" policy. Codemasters most recent update on the thread is September.Let the buyer beware. This game, even at sale price, is not worth it.[Edit: 10 months later (October, 2014), the issue is now pinned to the top of the discussion board, with dozens of possible work-arounds, but no firm solution or answer from the Developers]			"

Arcade style is ok. I have bought this game, because many people are like: IIts not realistic, its arcade, its to easy.. I dont know, what is hard for them, but this? With evry small hit, it is like ping-pong ball bouncing all over the screen. Car is sliding on almost every turn. Not playeble. C) Buggy. There is function to turn back time when you crash. Nice idea. Why not. But. It sometime does wotk, some time does not. D) Settings. Not enough settings. Like - how strong are arrow key press when turning.			"

												Warning notice before you buy: If you care about dlc cars just in single player. Then buy the game only because dlc cars are only for multiplayer.  Save up your cash by buying just the game without dlc, however if you don't mind multiplayer only dlc cars. Then go ahead! These cars are great, some better than others but in the end they're great! P.s even thought, this review gonna be ignored (most likely). I hope that at least one person didn't made the same mistake as i did. :D Oh, and one more thing: The game itself is great! But dirt 3 is way better in my opinion, however career mode's story is a bit better in grid 2.			"

												Months after release, the most active forum thread is one in which the screen keeps flashing black. Seems to mostly affect NVidia GPUs. Unfortunately, it affected me.  Steams ""opposite of the customer is always right"" no-return policy should come with a ""publishers need to be responsive to bug reports"" policy. Codemasters most recent update on the thread is September.Let the buyer beware. This game, even at sale price, is not worth it.[Edit: 10 months later (October, 2014), the issue is now pinned to the top of the discussion board, with dozens of possible work-arounds, but no firm solution or answer from the Developers]			"

												Amazing presentation style, along with great visuals.Doesn't port very well for PC in my opinion.Drift controls are rather hard to master on keyboard for someone that's new to drifting games.Not so much of a racing game, more of an arcade-styled drifting game.			"

												Tried online mode first. You can create an account and start customizing a car. There are no opponents, you can't race against anyone. No sessions to join, creating a session leaves you sitting by yourself in the lobby.On to career mode:Handling/controls are terrible. ""Drifting"" often results in the car flinging out of control, even at low speeds.My second career race: Shortly after starting the second lap (of 4) I passed an opponent and then in a turn my right front tire exploded. Due to the horrid camera controls (or lack thereof) I could not see the extent of the damage, only being notified by the lack of being able to turn left and the sparks flying off the ground. When the race ended it turned out that my entire wheel was gone, not just the rubber. When I started the final lap (now in second place) the announcer or whatever finally told me about the missing tire.Finished in second.Third career race: things are going well, we're 3 laps in and I've managed to just pass a vehicle into second place. About 10 seconds later I go to take a turn, only to be rammed by the guy I passed. His car stopped about where the impact occurred and he quickly drove away with minor damage. My car spun around fully and stopped in reverse. Got turned around and get rammed again, this time my car went flying into a wall and stopped abruptly. The car that hit me had no ill effects and just kept driving. Now I'm in 7th place. Get going again and I lose control of the vehicle. Slam into wall and car explodes.Done with this game			"

												Bad game - in so many levels.A) It craches. A lot. 6 time in one evening. B) Terrible control. I have played car games before. Im not expert player, i dont need ""super realistic"". Arcade style is ok. I have bought this game, because many people are like: IIts not realistic, its arcade, its to easy.. I dont know, what is hard for them, but this? With evry small hit, it is like ping-pong ball bouncing all over the screen. Car is sliding on almost every turn. Not playeble. C) Buggy. There is function to turn back time when you crash. Nice idea. Why not. But. It sometime does wotk, some time does not. D) Settings. Not enough settings. Like - how strong are arrow key press when turning.			"

General GameplayGRID 2 is the sequel to the BAFTA-award winning, multi-million selling Race Driver: GRID.What disappoints overall is the single-player experience, lots of content was removed and changed.The Multi-Player experience is still alive unlike the first game (servers were closed), but it's full with kids and cheaters, it's only enjoyable with a group of mature friends.As an arcade car game it's awesome, as a Race Driver: GRID sequel it's disappointing, if you want a Race Driver: GRID experience look at Grid: Autosport instead.The DLCs make it a minus too, considering some cars are locked under a paywall both in Single-Player and Multi-Player!Gameplay Rating: 2/5EngineEGO 3.0Graphics OptionsHas the same set of options has the first game, it's on par with all other games in the market!Graphics QualityThe engine suffered a huge improvement, specially in lightning! The colours feel more natural and the textures have higher quality too (Compared to Race Driver: GRID)!PerformanceA low-end PC can run this game at 60FPS without problems, some tweaking may be involved depending on the hardware!Engine Rating: 5/5Overall Rating: 7/10NotesOverall rating is a combination of the gameplay (mechanics and story) and engine (how the game looks and runs). If you disagree with my take on the game or if something is factually incorrect, please leave a comment below! "

												Game was unplayable due to constant stuttering, even after setting graphics to all low and getting 150+ fps. Was able to fix the issue by deleting replay30.pbf and replay60.pbf and replacing them with blank read-only text files. Before that nothing helped, not even a clean OS install. After that the game worked fine, but I can't give a positive review to a game that does something like that, and caused a huge amount of frustration before I managed to fix it. Pretty sad that the developers are not capable of fixing that.			"

												Driving model is just bad. The faster you drive the more you drift - 4WD car at low RPM drifts like crazy, which is just ridiculous. Biggest sin of this game.Single player - annoying. AI cars are made out of concrete. You hit them - you lose. They hit you - you lose. Medium difficulty - way to easy. Hard difficulty - AI cheats, sticky enemies and so on. Multiplayer - dead or dying.Heard that this game used to be popular in MP, but today you get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ SP and dead MP, so you better get GRID 1 which has excellent SP or newer GRID Autosport.			"

												Do you want an honest advice from somebody who knows what he is talking about? The advice is the best you can find and it is very effective! If you are running Windows 10, with the latest updates and a high end graphics card as the nVidia 980, DON'T BUY THIS GAME! It will mess up your computer so bad, if you don't know about computers, you may have to bring your computer to a computer service center and it may stay there for weeks before you get it back. The reason why it is cheap is, it does not run on latest hardware and operating systems properly, and they still want to sell this thing to you anyway to make the last bit of profit. They don't care if it will work or not on your latest PC. Your PC will crash, and if you have read this feedback and if you still buy this game, the crash will only be your responsibility. Don't be fooled when you see this game under the list of compatible games with Windows 10, of course it will be there.The game play is over-rated also. To make things look hard, the controls were made non-linear, meaning that there is no ratio between your input and how the dynamics of the car behaves. This only means that it will be difficult to master this game, in other words, you will not have fun playing the game, you will suffer trying to learn what they are trying to teach you how to play.

												This game is pretty fun, I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys racing games.However it is not without it's flaws:- Some of the cars feel like you're driving on ice most of the time, for example the T4 Mercedes that you get when you haven't levelled up enough to buy T4 cars...- When playing online the community seems hell-bent on screwing you over rather than properly racing.But, overall, a fun racer with good controls and, when you're up against reasonable opponents, you can have some pretty intense races.

												Good game, great graphics with not too high specs required. Sounds is pretty good but seemed roary in cars. It uses a drift to turn mechanics but still has to slow down for corners. I only play in multiplayers as you can upgrade the cars. The single player pretty much like a basic unlocking game with some achievements, specials here and there. Get it on discount like me. Buy DLC only when you play a lot online multiplayer, and beware of carnages in multiplayer.			"

												-Good Graphics (Cars can broken to the max)-The Scenery is fantastic-Koenigseggessegesegg Agera is the fastest car in here.-Lot of circuit is too narrow, and lot of curved turn, ( can't use the power of engine maximum at any stage)-( i hope there's Le Mans 24 like Grid but there isn't,)-Multiplayer works, i use UK region as Discussion advices-need to drift/slide to win the game, playing casual driving can win but hard. drift prefered.

												Decent enough racing game if you have never played Forza or Gran Turismo. They simply took the physics of DIRT and applied it to road cars instead. As you can imagine that doesn't really work too well once you get into supercars. AI is, quite simply, braindead. They do not react to player presence on the track in any way and in the event of any contact the player is screwed. AI vehicles appear to have the defensive abilities of tanks whereas you are sent flying at a mean look. The vehicles all look nice and the environment is kind of pretty but this game is only really worth it if you get it at a steep discount.			"

												I highly enjoy this game, the career or campaign or whatever is enjoyable. Does seem to get a bit lengthy towards the end however. But the graphics are very good, gameplay is fun, and just overall fun and enjoyable game. I'd recommend buying it if you are a fan of racing games. One thing I do not like is that the DLC's are quite expensive. Yet I do feel as if you're getting your money's worth. I'll admit some of them do cost a lot though. I'd recommend only buying track packs, and maybe a car pack here and there. The tracks that I have are Spa and Bathurst and they are fun road courses. I'm pretty sure the IndyCar Pack has a NASCAR-esque loop track so that may be worth checking out. I have also heard that the Multiplayer isn't very active anymore which is a downer. But in conclusion, this game is so much fun, looks great, plays great, CodeMasters optimizes there games very well. Buy it! Rating: 10/10			"

												Racing in GRID 2 is very fun with a great sensation of speed and control.  The customization of cars is much greater than GRID and GRID AS. This game feels much more aracade-like even than the first GRID, if you like games like Forza 4 more than games like Need for Speed Underground & Hot Pursuit then you should avoid this game and buy GRID AS instead.  The career is much better than GRID and not tedious like GRID AS.there are a few bad points:- no cockpit cam- CANNOT TURN OFF TRACTION CONTROL OR STABILITY CONTROL- as a result, drifting is terrible and I would hesitate to even call it drifting, more like powersliding.Overall a really fun arcade racer.

												Grid 2 is an arcade racing game developed and published by Codemasters and is a sequel to the populair Race Driver: Grid game.In Grid 2 you race in real world locations and cities such as Miami, Chicago, Paris, Barcelona, Côte d'Azur, Dubai, Japan and many more.In the singleplayer mode it's all about the World Series Racing (WSR) and you must work your way up by beating racing clans and prestige drivers in career club events, receiving fans and earn faster cars varying from Tier 1 to 4.There are many racetypes such as Time Attack, Elimination, Drift, Checkpoint, Faceoff, Destruction Derby (free dlc) and Race of course.The multiplayer mode behaves almost the same except that you do not earn fans but money per race in order to buy and upgrade your cars. Besides Online Events there are also game modes such as Global Challenge and Rivals for more entertainment.The DLC content packs for GRID2 are also great, giving you more cars and some of them have extra racetracks to challenge your competitors.Grid 2 is one of my first race games where I feel very comfortable to go online with. Every car feels different and the racetracks are very memorable for me. Although Codemaster left the well known cockpit view from the first game, Grid 2 is still very enjoying and true must have for people who love arcade racing!			"

												Ah yes, GRID 2. I just got this game, and I fell in love with it as soon as I got it. Want to hear my full story about it? Read down. If not, then just read this TL;DR: I love it, it has a easy learning curve, and the DLC cars are amazing. Graphics look great, even on low. Nice buy.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~As I was browsing Steam, I came upon some sales. I was happy because I had just recently been given a $20 Steam Gift Card for my birthday, so I knew that I may be able to snag a sweet deal on some game. So, being me, the first category I checked was Simulation. I found a few deals on some games but they didn't appeal to my style, so I left those. I decided to see if the Racing category had any sales. Checking the Specials, I scrolled down and saw a game called ""GRID"" and GRID 2"". They were both on for $8.89, and GRID 2 with all the DLC was on for a great deal of $13.39. I was intrigued by this game, so I decided to take a look. The reivews made the game look promising, although a few negatives would pop up here and there, complaining of ""rubber-necking AI', which that terminolgy is completely wasted on me. I decided to watch a few videos on it, and it looks great. Like Need For Speed, but just a tad more realistic with the breakable meshes and no nitrous boosts. Gladly, I forked over $13 and began my descent into GRID.I honestly have never played a racing game as great as this. I've only played for a few hours, well not even hours but I absolutely adore this game. Everything is very smooth in the way it runs, and the way the gameplay works exhilrates you and makes you feel like you're fighting to win these championships. I really enjoy this game and I can't wait to rack up hours on it.My ratings:Gameplay: 4/5 or 8/10 IN DEPTH ANALYSIS Car Models: 4.5/10 or 9/10 Sound Quality: 2/5 or 4/10 (most likely CPU) Track Quality: 3/5 or 6/10 AI Quality: 4/5 or 8/10 Overall Diffculty:5/5 or 10/10 ( You'll crash a lot :) ) GUI: 3/5 or 6/10Story: N/APros and Cons are kind of overrated, so just take my ratings and see if you'll enjoy this little game. It's great, and with the DLCs it makes the game more open and easier and relaxing, but with the challenging start and getting back into the racing category it's kind of hard for me.But I'll get there.

												Ok, so I'm not a huge racing game fan. I've never really been into need4speed, gran turismo, project gotham and so on. This probably has a lot to do with a friend who would take great pleasure in showing no mercy to noobs to racing games he'd been playing for months. Getting repeatedly lapped sucked the joy out of most of these games for me. Then I discovered Forza 2, a game that had somehow gone under his radar. And having not lost the will to live whilst playing it I actually got ok at it and played it upto the point when the endurance races begun. Then my friend discovered it and finally here was a racing game that I could beat him at. So the Forza franchise will forever hold a special place in my affections. But sadly Microsoft have not ported any version of Forza to the PC, which sucks.Step up Grid 2. Grid 2 has a feel of Forza about it. It looks beautiful, with graphics that are comparable to Forza 5. It boasts game play that can be exhillerating and infuriating during the same race. It also includes Brands Hatch and two F1 tracks in Yas Marina in the UAE and the Red Bull Ring in Austria. In short I have been looking for a racing game that I can find as enjoyable as I used to Forza. And although Grid 2 lacks the depth of Forza, I have found it every bit as enjoyable in the few short hours that I have played it, and for me there can be no higher praise for a racing game than that.8/10 (would be 9/10 if it was Forza)			"

												Absolutely wonderful. I'm not even done the game, but having played with cars in Tier 3, I can safely say that this game is an absolute blast especially with friends.+Fantastic graphics.+Well optimized. (I have it maxed out at 45-55fps without much fluctuation, so it's smooth!)+Lacking rubberband AI. They're just fast and don't really make mistakes.+No more need for a useless teammate!+Nice, arcade style racing. Oversteering never felt so satisfying.+Soundtrack is pretty bumpin'.+Your steering doesn't lock up at high speeds like some OTHER ""racing games"".+/-A big change from the more simulation oriented GRID 1+/-Lots of DLC cars.+/- Not too many tracks. Enough to be satisfying, and allow racers to learn the tracks.+/-Crashes are sometimes fun to watch when you screw up.-The difficulty can be a pain. Again, the AI makes virtually no mistakes.-AI cars are heavy, making it damn near impossible to wreck them for personal gain.			"

												Really great and smooth graphics... It's also kind of cool that there is a bit of a story, which you don't alway gein a racing game. The only bummer is that Codemasters did away with the in car veiw. The sim meets arcade feel that grid 1 had is gone. This is an arcade game like NFS or any other. It's a good game and really fun, but it just lacks the intensity of it's predecessor.			"

												GRID 2 is a great racing game. It has almost anything a racing fan would love in a game.The gameplay is like a normal racing. You go, you brake, you turn. It certainly doesn't get old as I feel like I must keep playing this game for at least 10 hours (I won't though). Very fast paced and the drifts are so satifing.The game looks great also. Every car looks great and you can customize your car to your liking. Any damage done to your car is clearly seen and it can make you sad when it tears your car up.Sound is nice with the sound of engines and pieces of metal when crashing. Soundtrack is good and sets the mode for a fast paced racing game.Would not be a bad buy at full price. (Get it for a good deal right now on Humble Bundle[www.humblebundle.com].

												Although this is a game that bases on legal racing, it doesn't have the typical steering guidance system that most games of this type within the genre are expected to have. Instead, it has a raw but smooth steering system that is pleasing to use, even with a keyboard. There is no economy (on carreer mode), but still has a big capability for car customization. And the variety of vehicles and gamemodes that can be unlocked are simply astonishing, giving the player an actual ""personality"" in-game, as he or she will pick the type of vehicle that pleases them the most and the events that they are best at. Also, the graphics, physics and AI give the game a very refined and smooth look, while providing a pleasing challenge to the average racing gamer.9/10			"

												Grid 2 is what I went to as a racing game fan for the PC because Forza is an Xbox only title. Not only does it offer an expansive and interesting single player campaign with various challenges but it also has a great multiplayer experience. It is always fun to play with friends while online and win or lose- it's always worth the laughs.Would recommend to those who enjoy racing games with a bit of challenge and a lot of fun.			"

												Key problem with the game... it's damn arcade. This game has nothing to do with racing, hitting the racing line correctly, accelerating but not overreving it at start. Absolutely nothing.From my point of view any game that includes drifting and gives reward for it, should be avoided in wide wide circle by real race fans.If you want casual racing, bumper cars so to say... then this is game for you. Younger players will like it as it does not require any skill on easier levels. I however, I'm deeply disapointed. I don't play games on easy settings, so I go for max difficulty and it's just insane that you can't compete with drifting of AI. This is not racing... I repeat, NOT RACING. "

												Although this is a game that bases on legal racing, it doesn't have the typical steering guidance system that most games of this type within the genre are expected to have. Instead, it has a raw but smooth steering system that is pleasing to use, even with a keyboard. There is no economy (on carreer mode), but still has a big capability for car customization. And the variety of vehicles and gamemodes that can be unlocked are simply astonishing, giving the player an actual ""personality"" in-game, as he or she will pick the type of vehicle that pleases them the most and the events that they are best at. Also, the graphics, physics and AI give the game a very refined and smooth look, while providing a pleasing challenge to the average racing gamer.9/10			"

												GRID 2 is a great racing game. It has almost anything a racing fan would love in a game.The gameplay is like a normal racing. You go, you brake, you turn. It certainly doesn't get old as I feel like I must keep playing this game for at least 10 hours (I won't though). Very fast paced and the drifts are so satifing.The game looks great also. Every car looks great and you can customize your car to your liking. Any damage done to your car is clearly seen and it can make you sad when it tears your car up.Sound is nice with the sound of engines and pieces of metal when crashing. Soundtrack is good and sets the mode for a fast paced racing game.Would not be a bad buy at full price. (Get it for a good deal right now on Humble Bundle[www.humblebundle.com]. Ends about 2PM December 8th)			"

												Do you want an honest advice from somebody who knows what he is talking about? The advice is the best you can find and it is very effective! If you are running Windows 10, with the latest updates and a high end graphics card as the nVidia 980, DON'T BUY THIS GAME! It will mess up your computer so bad, if you don't know about computers, you may have to bring your computer to a computer service center and it may stay there for weeks before you get it back. The reason why it is cheap is, it does not run on latest hardware and operating systems properly, and they still want to sell this thing to you anyway to make the last bit of profit. They don't care if it will work or not on your latest PC. Your PC will crash, and if you have read this feedback and if you still buy this game, the crash will only be your responsibility. Don't be fooled when you see this game under the list of compatible games with Windows 10, of course it will be there.The game play is over-rated also. To make things look hard, the controls were made non-linear, meaning that there is no ratio between your input and how the dynamics of the car behaves. This only means that it will be difficult to master this game, in other words, you will not have fun playing the game, you will suffer trying to learn what they are trying to teach you how to play.

												I highly enjoy this game, the career or campaign or whatever is enjoyable. Does seem to get a bit lengthy towards the end however. But the graphics are very good, gameplay is fun, and just overall fun and enjoyable game. I'd recommend buying it if you are a fan of racing games. One thing I do not like is that the DLC's are quite expensive. Yet I do feel as if you're getting your money's worth. I'll admit some of them do cost a lot though. I'd recommend only buying track packs, and maybe a car pack here and there. The tracks that I have are Spa and Bathurst and they are fun road courses. I'm pretty sure the IndyCar Pack has a NASCAR-esque loop track so that may be worth checking out. I have also heard that the Multiplayer isn't very active anymore which is a downer. But in conclusion, this game is so much fun, looks great, plays great, CodeMasters optimizes there games very well. Buy it! Rating: 10/10			"

I only play in multiplayers as you can upgrade the cars. The single player pretty much like a basic unlocking game with some achievements, specials here and there. Get it on discount like me. Buy DLC only when you play a lot online multiplayer, and beware of carnages in multiplayer.			"

												A brilliant follow-up to GRID. If you are looking for an exciting fast-paced arcade racer, then you'll not get better than this. With stunning visuals and a well formed storyline, yeah, you read right, storyline; GRID 2 delivers on all levels. Right from the get-go the Tier1 cars are all pretty solid and fun to drive and the races are varied and interesting. Progression through the tiers as you slowly ramp up the World Series Racing is engaging and fun. With some top cars, exciting moments and great battles, you'll remember the races for a while. Especially as you can record them and upload to YouTube from right in the game...and that's just the single player! Not even taking into account RaceNet and the world of online competition and rivalries you can setup along with global challenge races, I'm hopeful that it will continue to deliver for quite some time.A beautiful, fun and exciting arcade racer. A solid 9.5/10 from me			"

												First off I have played Grid 1 on my Playstation 3 and really enjoyed it and i would highly recommend you get that game instead of this one.This game has beutiful graphics and a remarcable attention to deatail appart from the lack of  an inside view which in my opinion that may put some people off. Visuals asisde the gameplay has ""updated"" the drifting but i feel they have over done it for me it was a steap learning cuvre that took me ages to figure out this also makes the game feel more of an arcade game rather than a sim. Personally the only high point of this game were the graphics i also hope that they sort out this drifting feature for the next one (if there is going to be one) i give this game a 6/10pros .nice graphics.plenty of cars.interesting game modes cons.shoddy drifting mechanic.very repetitive			"

												You can't take shortcuts and can't even toggle them so you can take shortcuts.This totally ruins the fun in my opinion. People wanting a realistic racing approach wont be bothered by this though.Also the controls feel wierd like they are delayed.The graphics are nice though and the Cars look good too.I bought it on sale though so its okay but the normal price is way too high for it.4/10			"

												This game is not like any other Codemasters racer. They went full on Arcade this time, with a big focus on drifting. A normal race is still more about drifting than about racing. Things go like this: full throttle - violent brake - throw your car into a very convoluted corner sliding on all four wheels, then again flat out and so on. There is no cockpit view, there are no real tracks, no car setup and tunning. They could not be bothered with such stuff. Probably because they were to busy making DLC cars and tracks because half of the cars in the game you bought need to be purchased. Yep. TOTAL rip off, avoid like plague untill they drop the price to 10 bucks. Multiplayer is deserted most of the time, and when you do find a game, you cannot join because you need to buy some DLC car or track. I got mine with a CPU but I really feel sorry for those guys who payed 40 bucks for this game. "

												Don't listen to Bullet. His points are ridiculous. The game is an 'ARCADE' racer and it does not pretend to be otherwise.'No interior view'. So what, it's not missed. the bonnet view is good enough. It's not a simulation. 'Lack of game music/theme'. Who cares? I don't play racing games for the music. 'Lack of rear view mirror'. Again it's not a simulation. I don't miss it and the fact is the game gets better performance without it.'Pure arcade car handling'. Yeh because it's an 'ARCADE' racer.'Most cars if not all are drift happy, as the game rewards drifting even in circuit racing'. Yeh because it's an 'ARCADE' racer.Do you see where I am going with this? As Arcade racers go the damage model is really good. It's not just asthetic, your car's handling changes. You lose speed, pull to the left, slip gears etc WHich forces you to drive correctly and not just bounce of the walls and ram other drivers.My score. 8.5/10 "

												First I'd like to say that you dont need to use the brake in this game at all (look at the achievement, if you dont believe me)Second this is  an arcade racer where the other (AI) racers main job is to bash you around the track, feels like theyre driving solid granite cars compared to your cardboard crumple zone.  This is a step backwards compared to Grid and to add to that someone screwed up the controls, why do we need two handbrake buttons?  The normal brake button feels as if all the brake bias is set to the rear, it instantly sends you into a drift as soon as you touch the left or right button at the same time.Also unlike Grid you cannot fine tune your controller deadzones or sensitivity.  Good thing I bought this at 75% off otherwise I would have been peeved.			"

												Dear AmericaYou produced some very attractive looking vehicles in the form of the Ford Mustang, Dodge Charger and Chevy Camero. However, these vehicles are deeply, deeply awful racing cars. Even the game itself seems to accept this as they handle like the dogs they are. Therefore, why do you insist we have to drive these lumps of pig iron when it is obvious that your European and Japanese allies make much better vehicles? We have McDonalds, Pizza Hut and KFC. Why can you not simply accept that we make better cars and that it is really dumb to make us have to drive these blocks of lard.Thank youLoveEuropeps. nice game			"

												It's a pretty game. But there are a lot of issues for me personally. One of them is the AI - they are, quite literally, on rails. If you perform a PIT maneuver on an AI driver nothing happens, they continue straight on their predetermined line, and you slow down. Another thing that really bugged me were the penalties for cutting corners, sure you could argue I should 'get good' but for me a lot of fun in racing comes from exploiting the grass to my advantage. It's impossible to disable the penalties, even in single player. Having purchased a Driving force GT racing wheel I was disappointed to find out that the game is unplayable with it. I had huge difficuties controlling anything - where as DiRT 3 works very well. The best way to play this is with a controller.I did enjoy the first few hours a lot though, but in the end I gave up in frustration.			"

												Love it! Environments are so dynamic, crashing is so realistic, almost to the point where I enjoy crashes, because they're so visually beautiful to watch, if you have an 'average' rig, you can still run ultra setting at about 30-40peak. Which is great! Mechanics on driving are so realistic too!Pros:-Realistic driving mechanics-Car customization.-Great races and AI mechanics are realistic and smart.-Visually ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic.Cons:Car customization is limited to rims, patterns, colours, and vinyls. No engine customization, making you just as good as the AI (no bumpers/spoilers)loading screens can be a bit annoying.OVERALL!Game is great! would recommend to all people who are beginner or ametuer to racing games! or Pro.

												I have never been this disappointed in a second title in a series of games. Looking back at how perfect a racing game GRID is, I cannot believe what an absolute dismal game GRID 2 is. I am not sure why the developers took a fully functional game and strip the life out of it. The biggest problem is that they want to make competitive racing games but they removed the option to race on a lag free LAN.  In all honesty, rather spend your money on GRID and give GRID 2 a skip.			"

												i don't know and i dont care why this game has so many negative reviews by users. ( Probably their expectations were to high). First of all GRID 2 isn't a simulation game. IF you want that, look elsewhere. If you want a fast paced racing, arcade style game then Grid is an excellent choice. It's fun, thrilling and still has great graphics. PIcked up again recently and played for a few hours and i was blown away. Very cool game !			"

												When you start the game you feel like:´Choose nickname,what am I? Noob?´ But when you jump into the action,in the legendary Ford Mustang it´s another felling like in the menu. Through racing you have more and more challenges to complete:promos,vehicle challenges. Big plus is that there are various race modes:Elimination,Checkpoint,Drift,Touge,Faceoff,race. My favourite cars are Mustang Boss and Agera R,i finished the game after 16 hours,i think this is the one of the top 5 racing games in the whole world. 11/10 D-GN "

												Ever wonder what it's like to powerslide your way to fame? Grid 2's got you covered.This is seriously one of the most arcadey racers I've ever played, and I had bought this and went in expecting a sim a-la Gran Turismo. Initially I was extremely disappointed as a result, but it grew on me. It's frantic fun.If I could compare the driving to any other game, it would be Need for Speed: High Stakes (PC), a callback to 1999 (you know, when NFS games were quality fun). It's fast, the slides are flashy and make you go ""DAAAAAMMMMMN!"", the wrecks are insane and the cars have absolutely no weight to them whatsoever. It literally feels like you're driving a delicate piece of paper where one small bump or wrinkle crumples and destroys the entire paper. It takes quite a while to get used to the driving style, frustratingly so, but give it some time; you'll get there eventually.The career mode is as follows: A new racing organization called the WSR wants to score the big time. Thank ♥♥♥♥ you came along because you're gonna make it happen. As you complete races, fame and faster cars come your way. That's basically about it, but it's fine for a racing game. Who the hell plays a racing game for story, anyway?It's got a decent roster of cars, though its all mostly what you've probably seen in any other racing game; Nissan R34 Skyline and 300ZX, Dodge/SRT Viper GTS, Mazda RX-7, Aerial Atom, Chevrolet Camaro (both old and new), Pagani Huayra just to name a few.One of my biggest complaints is that there is NO customization for any of the cars in terms of performance. What you see is what you get. Perhaps it's my fault for, again, expecting a racing sim, so maybe I just can't let that go, but it would've still been fun have the option. The only thing you can customize is the car's livery. You can do them individually for each car or use the same one for every car; the choice is yours.There are several different types of racing events, including but not limited to: standard circuit (WHOA! Who would've thought?!), checkpoint challenge, knockout, drift and ""face off"" which is basically a one-on-one duel. There's enough variety to keep things from getting too stale.The controls are nice and responsive, almost too much so, and controller support is great; my PS3 controller and Logitech F310 work fantastic. Game client is stable; no crashes at all. On very rare occasions I get small frame drops in particularly intensive situations but anyone with a higher-end card shouldn't have an issue with that (I would assume most of you aren't using a decade old card like a GeForce 8800 GTS like my broke♥♥♥♥♥. And even with that considered, the drops are incredibly rare.If you're looking for the ultimate arcade racer in modernized form, Grid 2's worth checking out.			"

												It's a pretty game. But there are a lot of issues for me personally. One of them is the AI - they are, quite literally, on rails. If you perform a PIT maneuver on an AI driver nothing happens, they continue straight on their predetermined line, and you slow down. Another thing that really bugged me were the penalties for cutting corners, sure you could argue I should 'get good' but for me a lot of fun in racing comes from exploiting the grass to my advantage. It's impossible to disable the penalties, even in single player. Having purchased a Driving force GT racing wheel I was disappointed to find out that the game is unplayable with it. I had huge difficuties controlling anything - where as DiRT 3 works very well. The best way to play this is with a controller.I did enjoy the first few hours a lot though, but in the end I gave up in frustration.			"

												In a world where need for speed most wanted (the original before some idiot decided to ruin the name) exists GRID 2 just isn't up to par, an annoying voice is forced on to you during the races unless you've made it to the options to turn the voices off, the options menu isn't even accessable from the main menu because ♥♥♥♥ logic, game defaults to a small window with a bunch of terrible graphical settings as defaults that force unwanted blur and such, no soundtrack because they prefer droning d bags talking at you, and slight side on crash can tear camera control from you ruining recovery, there's a needless rewind system (hey if the game handles bad enough that it's a requirement that's a red light) and the small amounts of superficial car customization is ruined by forced sponsor decals all over any half decent paint job you can put together.If you need a good racing game buy NFS: Most Wanted from 08 I believe it was (the terrible one of the same name was 2012) with it's optional slowtime (mainly used in cop chases), good soundtrack, actual feel of force to the cars, proper customization, open-ish world, and interesting race tracks/events.

												I have never been this disappointed in a second title in a series of games. Looking back at how perfect a racing game GRID is, I cannot believe what an absolute dismal game GRID 2 is. I am not sure why the developers took a fully functional game and strip the life out of it. The biggest problem is that they want to make competitive racing games but they removed the option to race on a lag free LAN.  In all honesty, rather spend your money on GRID and give GRID 2 a skip.			"

												Although Grid 2 is a great game on it's own, it does not make up for it's issues and faults (especially the PC version). Not to mention I went through so many problems with the game black screening, and the game constantly crashing (Pretty much gave up at this point). Although I did have it working at one point or another, probably to do with the fact I was using AMD prior to switching back to Nvidia and it was working flawlessly, but since doing some research I've seen people also have the same issues with AMD rigs, including their CPU. I know there's many solutions to these issues, but I really don't feel as if spending the time trying to fix the issues will encourage me to play it as much as the GRID before the 2nd installment.If you're into the GRID series then I'd easily recommend this game, but with the amount of effort required to get this game working without any hiccups is ridiculous.

												This game could have been great, it has mediocre but graphics a good general theme, but then a few small details went and ruined it. While racing I found that the camera angle kept changing and faced to the side of the car or even backwards, which is a huge problem. I could not play more than 10 minutes of this game but when trying to quit I noticed there was no option of quitting on the menu and the only option was opening task manager and ending it. If you are willing to deal with these small problems and you like Driving/Racing game this may be a good game for you.			"

												The A.I. cars are on rails and I'm sliding around like on ice with slicks. I kept trying, thinking maybe I would get a handle on the loose cars but never did. I had bought all the DLC with the game because it was on sale and the game looked awesome.    In a last ditch hope the cars would improve I created a Tier 4 race and used a DLC car to test...I was still on ice and they were still on rails. I could forgive this if the tracks were at least designed with power-sliding in mind but it was like there were two different teams making this game. Team one designed the curvy, tree lined, cliff dropping couses with tight controls and handling in mind. Team two designed the cars and physics of said cars with wide fast tracks and arcade like controls in mind. Now the problem is it seems like they didn't consult with each other until the product was ready too launch and this is what we are left with. I wish at the very least the squirelly handling effected the A.I. cars as badly as it does me. At least then it would feel fair.			"

This game is clearly made for gamepad og keyboard for pc not stearingwheel, there is NO calibration avalible in the game like in most games that support racing wheels. So if you are going to play this game dont use a wheel go for a controlerpad.(BTW. No matter how bad you drive the guy who speeks in your earpice keeps saying how awesomely good you drive. Whats with that.)So basically if you are looking for a racing game to use your racing wheel in, this is not the game and especially not while using the G27 wheel.			"

												... Use of a keyboard with this game, is possible, but not advisable. I don't have a joystick, or my driving would be greatly increased. On the overtake track, my husband said,""How could you crash up such a great vehical like that?"" My reply was,""apparently quite easilly, hit a few walls, knock the slow moving trucks with flashing yellow lights out of the way..."" after a short pause, from laughing, I continued to say, ""I swear it was a car when I started the race, crossing the finnish line in first place is always a wonderful feeling, even if it looks like I drove through a trash compacter, and the guy telling me that the chassis has sustained heavy damage, and the vehical is missing a tire or 2 on the same side...""This racing game is not for beginner racers, the first track for your career is a real pain, hit a tree hard enough, and you are out of the race, fly off the track and it resets the car's possition, as it should be. Some minor aggressive driving, does no good, as the oponet's vehical is barelly moved, an attempted pit manuver will fail, something I have been able to do in most really good racing games to mess the computers up.The worst start for a racing game if I ever found worse, it would be hard to do. It doesn't give you a chance to get used to ""your"" vehical, and throws you into a starting race when the game begins. No 2 racing games are the same, the physics for every racing game is at least slightly different, and every vehical handles differently. I would recomend a gentler starting point, either a few city blocks to free drive through, or a gentle race track that you can keep going back to that has no lap limits, just to get you familiar with your car, and what you are capable of doing.If it has a mechanic shop, for tweaking the vehicals, I haven't found it yet, and there is no upgrading of the vehicals.The body shop for graphics is really neat, gives a wide range of graphics designs and colors for the cars, one of the best I have seen in racing games to date, pretty cars won't win races tho. Give a racer a rusty piece of junk car and give them $1500 to fix it up. They will be sure the brakes are working really good, and the engine isn't about to blow, a few minor tweaks to engine and drive train is all it takes. It rattles and shakes, sounding like it's about to come appart as it hits the track. Meanwhile, you get your fancy new car, and before long, you loose, just cause they have more skill at driving than you do.			"

												It's a racing game that in career mode there is no way to get to the pole position. As such, the game encourages you to get to the front of the pack, not by driving well, but by using the flashback button to destroy the leader as many time as possible. I picked it up for 6.00, and to be honest, it's worth sub 5.00 due to the lack of in game dash display mode and the lack of any possible way to move to the front of the pack while driving well.			"

												Fun game pretty good deal for $12.49 couldn't pass this Racing genre.  Great Graphics, gameplay, cars, but I still miss GRID 1's original cockpit view as to the 2nd version lacking it :(  Just a way of lazyness on the developers part.  They took it out using a 1% users use cockpit view shouldn't matter it's a racing game all racing games should have this view no questions asked.Multiplayer is a blast especially bringing back Destruction Derby.  Single player would be ok if they didn't make the opponents over powering like when you want to make them wreck they have way too much power over you from making it possible you either have to go 100mph to side swipe them to even get into any collision, other than that good luck trying at any other speed, please make this an option or fix, thank you.  Other than that the game is worth the money especially the sale we had.			"

												Steering wheel setting controls are HORRIBLE! Worse than GRID 1. You can't fine tune anything other than force feedback, and the mustang you're given has the most senstive steering and if i try to turn the wheel just a little, BAM! straight into the wall.

Features include: unresponsive steering, horribly optimized graphics, very bad corner-cutting detection, etc.Even at sale price, stay away.I'd rather play Bad Rats.			"

I'm about 30 meters from the finish line and the AI car pulls the cheat button and wins the race even the car was miles away from me !voting it down to be the worst racing game ever don't waste your money on this game			"

												Slightly older game, but it still manages to holds its own against newer titles. Controls feel good without being *too* silly and arcade-y. Good selection of cars with fairly distinct characteristics to choose from. Pretty nice selection of tracks — the downhill mountain track in Japan is a personal favourite. Excellent casual online racing fun against your friends, especially if you have a good range of cars unlocked. I just wish we could change that stupid 20 second countdown before each race, as I prefer a bit more time to think about my vehicle choice.			"

												GRID 2 suffers from severe issues in the user interface. It forces you to race a match before it will let you do anything else, such as pick your player name. And the list of names available are all MALE, names like Randy, Jeff, Muhammed and even Jesus... but not a single female name to pick from! Way to alienate half of the population, Codemasters.In one race I got spun around, and amidst the confusion and smoke I didn't realise I was facing the wrong way. The game didn't tell me that I was going the wrong way, but it did abruptly disqualify me.It also seems to lock most of the cars away from you, until you've levelled up. If you want to play a Level 1 multiplayer game with anything but an Alfa Romeo, you're sweet outta luck. Try again in about a dozen or so races.It boggles my mind that a game that feels so fun to play is being choked to death by bad designers.			"

												Transformed game compared to Grid (1). This is better in every way possible, I could not ne bothered to play the original but in this the UI feels modern. The cars drive well, you can feel/understand the weight transfer even using a game pad. This makes it fun to play. This is worth getting if on special.UPDATE: As you get further in you are forced to play bumper cars at the start of races to force your way through the pack quickly enough to have a chance to win races. The later levels also have a wild spread of difficulty that ranges from simple to insane and not much between. The hard levels are caused by stupid looooooog tracks with no run off and the need to use cars that handle really badly but really fast. Because of this I lost interest, shame as great fun until that pontUPDATE: Do not buy any of the DLC, it mostly appears to be based around online which is dead			"

												 OK so, after probably 5.6 hours of literally sitting around in the menus, and tabbing out the game to find a solution to the game crashing every 3 minutes, i found a solution that works for me. If you want to know it, ask me below, because i dont feel it is the right place to do it in the review. I really do feel like the dev's of this game (Codemasters) are ignorant by not fixing this problem as it seems to be persistent through many computers. Moving on, back to the review, i DO NOT recommend it, it is utterly useless. I did not buy the game, it came with the PC i bought and i thought i would try it out. But dont think about buying it. The game is not realistic at all in my opinion, unless you think that theres lubricant on the road 100% of the time. Using a Logitech G27 it is impossible to drive, going around a little corner and it slips, even without accelerating on it. On the other side of the game, the graphics are beautiful, very realistic looking. Not to mention the cheesy loading screens though, my eyes hurt after restarting the game a couple of times.			"

												Could've been a good racing game but sadly it's being let down by pretty much all of it's parts. I can accept arcadey physics and handling as long as car behaviour is at least somewhat plausible. In this game however seems to be made with the sole purpose of looking cool from the outside. If you have the slight interest in driving and racing just stay away from this one. It's about style, not much else. Also every single design choice seems to be made to make the experience as annoying as possible.			"

												i thought i was buying a raceing game not a bumper boats simulator. its a game about takeing a zig- zag of a track and shoveing cars with wheels made of wet soap on the road and knocking everyone else out of the game by raming them into walls. the physics are faulty and cheating is more than encoraged. ive seen indie developers make beter racing games than this.

Second, Grid is a great game if your hand eye coordination is lacking and you dont like cars driving like they do in the real world. Three, Grid is a great game if you hate customization of any sort, i mean absolutley loathe it.

Nope.Software issues aside if you have no problems running the game it looks decent and it's mediocre-ly fun with the free Derby DLC. Personally I own too many Deathmatch Derby games to be something new to me and I have played better games so a solid 6/10 from me.			"

												A fun and challenging racer, the cars in GRID 2 handle and feel just right,  different from recent NFS games and its toy-car physics but not too realistic to be a driving sim. Must of the tracks are well done and some just look great, interesting single player mode and great looking cars make GRID 2 a very solid racer.			"

												You get a really small variety of cars with the base game. I'd say at most, you get maybe 15? Then theres a ton more in DLC packs. If I didnt buy this game for $1, and was able to get the Grid 2 All in One DLC for like $6, I'd feel really quite ripped off.However, online is fun. All the cars feel different. Driving feels great. Except for the beginning of races with more than 4 people. The beginning is like a ♥♥♥♥ing demoliton derby. If you're in first, steer the hell out of anyones way. If you're in the middle, you're pretty lucky. I cant tell if a lot of the community is trolling or just really terrible at racing. I'll be slowing down at a corner, like most people do, and this idiot rear ends me, makes me spin out, and slams into the wall. Sometimes I'll hear them laughing, other times I can just see that they're really terrible. I'll look behind me and see this guy trying to take turns going way too fast and slamming into a wall or going off track. Either way, trolling or terrible skill, its really annoying getting slammed by them and then your car is just destroyed, and you fall way behind.But after a while you get used to it, and learn to stay the hell away from people, and pickout the trolls/idiots and the people who actually want to race. A con is that theres only upgrading and modding your vehicles on multiplayer. Single player is pretty much you getting a pre setup car, and taking it for racing. I dont get why they went this route instead of letting us having modding on and offline. Eventually, this games online will completely die out. Online is nearly dead. If you play on American servers, for whatever reason its super dead. Switch your download settings to London UK, and you'll find matches much more often.			"

Good everything else.By the way, this game is an arcade racing game with a mix of simulation. 70% arcade & 30% Simulation.But if you like racing games, this game is the best.Also the online is the best of a racing game.Go buy it.Hint : buy the dlc pack or at a discount.

												I am NOT a racing game fan. I find racing games difficult to get into, often counterintuitive to control, and unnecessarily restrictive with cars and tracks.Also, I'm terrible at it.However, I found myself in the mood for a fun racing game after playing GTA V with its many amazing modded cars, and saw GRID 2 on the Lunar New Year sale, so I gave it a try.I'm glad I did.PROS:- GRID 2 doesn't punish hilariously inept racers like me from the get-go. It does a great job of easing you in, and you can start on noob settings, like I did, or try genuinely difficult settings. It's great for all skill levels.- It's FUN! Some racing games feel stressful. GRID 2 doesn't. The game does a good job of capturing the joy of driving.- The controls feel INTUITIVE! You know how the best games almost make you ""feel"" obstacles with your controller, mouse, joystick or steering wheel? The games that make you duck IRL when you're flying below something, or recoil to dodge a projectile or piece of shrapnel? GRID 2 is the racing version of that. The controls feel completely natural from the start, and they are equally precise.- The cities are lovingly rendered. You can race through Barcelona and see the Sagrada Familia looming over the streets; rocket through brightly lit Hong Kong at night; cruise Dubai's ultra-modern tracks; race in the shadow of the Eiffel tower...and on and on. The background art in this game is spectacular. - It's well optimized. Framerate holds up fantastically, and I'm using a GTX 760, not the worst but not the best either. The important thing is, this game runs incredibly smooth, something that's always appreciated in a game where twitch response is important.- The cars are awesome. It's not exclusively supercars, although the game has its share of Paganis and McLarens. There are American muscle cars, drift cars from Nissan and Honda, and high-performance vehicles from makers like BMW, Audi, etc. The paint options are legion, with a shading system to get the exact colors you want, and choices between things like metallic, matte, pearlescant, flip, etc.- The game can be set to speak your real name, and your racing team leader gives you helpful tips when you're on the track or practicing. It's all situational, and so far it hasn't been repetitive at all.CONS:- While you can choose from any track (or so it seems) in custom events, you still have to unlock cars in career mode, unfortunately. - You can change wheels, but it's not clear if they're anything more than aesthetic changes. That's  fine with me, but maybe some people would want more depth.- I'm not Vin Diesel.OVERALL: Would recommend, even for terrible racers like me. Most of all, it's FUN.			"

												What are grand turismo , forza motorsport or need for speed ? They are in rubbish bin due to the release of grid 2.Because this game is so great, great enough that Grid 2 you must NOT to buy becaue others racing game titles are not longer to be fun after this. Thus, I highly NOT recommend you to buy the Racing game of the Decade - Grid 2 ! Especially in sales.But please do consider buy the vanilla game in full price + All dlc in full price or ...........Go grab thishttp://www.codemasters.com/uk/article/125-000-grid-2-mono-edition-the-world-s-most-expensive-videogame/FOR THE GREEDY CODDIES.

												Decent game. Playability, very similar to Grid 1. Longevity, depends on whether you want to drop 30 snots for DLC. Plenty of playtime without, though.Reliability - honestly, terrible. Ridiculous bugs that plagued DiRT 3 are still present.Overall - no way do I recommend this game, until such a time as the bugs are ironed out (which won't happen) and the DLC drops in price.Update 5th/October/2014 - to date, still no patch to fix the bugs since I originally reviewed this on 3rd/December/2013. And, of course, no patch in sight, seeing as the same bugs have carried over to it's predecessor. And a tech support team who aren't in any way familiar with it's products. Codemasters..... Code....Masters?? Hmmm...			"

												This game is such a let-down in terms of playability because it suffers from the 'Black Screen Crash' and unfortunately no one is taking responsibility nor prepared to fix the issue.A number of workarounds have been posted here on Steam and on various websites and after trying out many of the suggestions I have managed to play the game for short periods of time before the inevitable crash occurs.Therefore I do not recommend this game which clearly suffers from bad programming , it is a game which should never had been sold to the public in it's current state.If this were a hardware product it would have not been sold in the first place because it would be classed as faulty goods, I don't see why any digital product should be any different.

												I really hate this new trend where game sequels are now crap compared to their predecessors, where all of the substances and originality of the first game is tossed away in favor of generic, trend tedium that we have seen in a million other games. Buy Grid 1, it's better. On it's own merits, Grid 2 is about average or slightly better than your average racer. Grid 1 is a 3rd the price though and superior in most ways. Aside from being completely linear with no real choice in what races to compete in (and a cluster ♥♥♥♥ of completely bland cars), Grid 2 takes itself way too seriously and sacrifices game modes and gameplay for flashy cutscenes.

												This review does not take into account multiplayer, as I did not play multiplayer.Admittedly, I wasn't much of a fan of GRID 1.  But having seen the new race types via YouTube videos, I picked up GRID 2 and the two track packs for about $16USD.GRID 2 is alright if you're wanting to run some quick, custom races and don't mind drifting around every corner.  But the career mode is little more than a trickle of new race types on the same few tracks shoved between infuriatingly long and unskippable cut scenes.I suppose I got my $16 worth.  I'll probably do some single-player custom races from time to time (in order to see the two additional tracks I bought), but career mode is dead to me.			"

												Grid 2 is a confident, aggressive, good-looking racer that boasts a level of focus last year’s Dirt: Showdown didn’t have. It’s well executed and easily the measure of the award-winning original in all but a couple of areas. However, missteps with how it approaches its track content will harm its long-term appeal, and further shedding of its sim-based roots will continue to alienate fans of the racing games Codemasters made back in the late ’90s and early 2000s.

												bad mechanics, drifting all the time, different track everytime, so forget about remembering which turn is next.if you bump into AI in front of you, you may already restart the race. impossible to keep on the track, but if you bump - some tracks will just stop you, some will turn you.

												Now people who say that its like driving on ice should try taking a rear wheel car and go full speed and turn their wheel ful left or right and see what happens. Because if you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that you dont understand when you play on keyboard and when you press right the cars wheel turns full right because its a ♥♥♥♥ing keyboard not a steering wheel. Besides if you really think you just going to slowly turn right or left while driving over 150 killometers per hour and think you not going to slide. Then my friend you are a ♥♥♥♥ing moron			"

												This is THE racing game of all time!!!The fun level is off the charts, and it's the kind of racing game that makes you crave the first position at all costs. No matter how many times you have to repeat the track over and over and over until you get the first position. Third will not do. It's the kind of game that will leave you with muscle cramps in your fingers and hand and rist from turning and braking and drifting. it's insane!!! The graphics are a treat for the eyes, and the feel and sound of the car work perfectly. It's a lovely game and I wanna thank the producers from the very core of my gaming heart. I haven't felt this good about a game in a long, long time.			"

												AI ramming you up the backside all the time. One example is winning the race with 10 seconds to go and get rammed into a wall and car dies so I just wasted 6 minutes for nothing. The better the car the worse the handling gets to the point of being on icy with no grip because the game wants you to drift everywhere. The commentator keeps talking about having to fix the car, which doesn't matter as you don't have money and it is his job to fix the car so why not stfu? The cutscenes for your career feel so cheap and tacky and this game is nowhere near as good as the original Grid, which also had a car cockpit which Codemasters taken out of this Grid.			"

												I didn't play more than 50mins of this game to know how horribly unrealistic it is.When you're like me who has been playing GRID 1 for so many hours, loving the feel of the cars and the looks of the game, and then you jump to GRID 2 thinking ""How in the world could GRID 2 be that much better, because GRID 1 already is the best racing game I've played."" then you sit down and watch as your car hits an invisible wall at 80mphs and all your car does is bounce off of it like a trampoline and have little to no damage, when you expected to fly off the ♥♥♥♥ing cliff and watch your driver and car just get destroyed.Don't waste your money on GRID 2 or GRID Autosport. Just buy GRID 1 and enjoy the beauty of it!			"

												PROS:Nice GraphicsRealismCONS:Be aware, everyone with a 500, 600 and 700 series Nvidia cards have major compatibility issues. The game is unplayable if you have an Nvidia GPU, every  10 minutes your PC's GPU will freeze and you will probably need to reboot the PC. Terrible coding for Nvidia cards from Codemasters. This is a known issue since release and there is not a workable fix, even Nvidia blaims that on the game's coding.All in all a good racing game, but I will not support Codemasters again if they stick to terrible Nvidia GPU porting.

Better than Dirt 3 which at the moment of this review , does not even work and it too is made by Codemasters. Go figure?			"

												Do not buy!The first time you start the game you're taken to a tutorial, so to say, which constists of a couple of different, short races. At this point I was already shocked; how can the driving of this game be this horrible? I shook my head and hoped that this was just a tutorial thing; maybe the developers wanted to give a very hand-held driving mode for the tutorial so no one can lose it. But I was wrong, so wrong. I completed the tutorial, and found out that the handling of this game is still horrible. It's even worse than that of GTA V, which, bear in mind, is NOT a driving game at all! It's not worth paying any money for this at all, even if you get this game for free, there's no reason to play it. It has no vehicle upgrading, it has no free driving, and most importantly, it has the worst driving mode I have ever experienced. This game doesn't seem to cater to any player group, hence my listing of lacking features above. What it does have is a career-mode with different tracks and styles: street, race and drift. I can not tell anything more though, as I quit the game after 38 minutes, but apparently there are quite a few of those available. I completed the tutorial, one additional race and of course I had to test drive an Alfa Romeo, but that's it. Enough for me and never again. I hope I can get a refund of this.TL;DR: The handling is the worst of any game I've ever tested.			"

Coudln't find how to quit the game, wow that's a great start. Having to CTRL+ALT+DEL to force end this sh*tty game.Not much improvement at all from the first GRID. This game sucks.Honestly, it's a f*cking pathetic racing game, but all racing games suck.I don't give a f*ck about your f*ggot a** opinion on how you're a mechaphilia is, so shut the f*ck up.THIS GAME SUCKS A** DO NOT BUY ANY GRID GAMES!-10/10 "

												this game starts with an anticipation of greatness but quickly becomes dissapointing as the more you get into the game the worse the cars handle. there is no consistency of handling between the diffent cars and this makes the game enjoyment dissapear very quickly. I would not suggest this game.			"

												At first I was really excited about this game. I have not played a racing game in ages. The last one I played was NFS Hot Pursuit.   It started out pretty good. The graphics were great and the interface was pretty decent.   Regarding the offline career, there are different ways you can get through it. Either you have to complete racing missions or you have to complete drifting missions. You get two cars to chose between, and then you are off. The main goal is to win the missions which will increase your fan base (amount of followers / viewers). When you have enough fans, you unlock a big event, which you have to complete. Then, you basically start over. The only difference is the tracks change and the opponents get a little harder. On your way up, you win new cars. There is no feature, where you can tweak and tune them. The cars are how they are, though you can change their appearance.The gameplay is okay. It is not that hard to master the drifting and the racing is pretty easy as well. If you fail, you can always use the rewind button and correct your mistake. Besides that, there are no features worth mentioning. I bought the game to play the career, so all over it was a pretty disappointing experience. I would not recommend anyone to buy this game if they like me expect a good career.			"

												Solid racer, but I prefer the more real world race world of the original grid. I also prefer the cars, tracks and handling of the old game, not to forget the team approach with multiple cars.Codemasters chose not use real world licenses and ended up with a fantasy race league, which is IMHO again a real step back.A city race with dynamically changing routes is not believable, as it would be virtually impossible to change a layout while the race is ongoing as is the case in Grid 2. Not that it isn't fun, but again it detracts from the level of realism that was present in the original Grid.In the end, regardless of some graphical improvements, I just prefer the original over Grid 2 and hope that Codemasters will revert to the same type of game if they ever produce Grid 3.Good game, but I recommend you look at Grid before Grid 2, unless you want to play multiplayer.Codemasters pulled the plug on the old Grid MP, not very nice of them...certainly not a long term selling point.

												This game is excellent.Pretty cars, lovely environments and a pretty good driving experience.I too have experienced the ""aggressive AI"" but in my opinion its less that they're aggressive and more that they stick to their racing line regardless of what you do and thus end up causing you to spin out and go off track often.Still, super fun game.

												This game sure has a lot of mixed reviews on here and it does suffer from some annoyances. Even at times it seems like a bit of a step back from grid1, but don’t let that stop you from checking it out.  The game is fun, its arcade racing it’s what you would expect from it and I am having a great time with it.  I love simulators, racing with a wheel and everything, but it’s a different animal.  It’s putting down laps, tuning, putting down laps, and tuning some more it can get to be a little bit of grind. There is no real carrot on a stick in the sim world to keep you going and wanting to unlock things its all about the driving(which is prefectly fine).   However this game is just grabbing the controller, throwing the car all over the place, drive tons of different cars, go into corners way to fast and just have some fun.  I’ve always been a fan of codemaster racing games; I got into them back on the ps1 with the Collin McRae games, and then onto TOCA, all good times.  Coming to this from the first Grid it does seems a little dumbed down I suppose.  It was nice to have to save up money to buy cars instead of just getting them handed to you, and doing the Le Mans race between season ect.  However the career board got a bit overwhelming with having so many events to do all at once.  That is one nice thing of how the career progress’s, and not overloading you with races. Instead you are going through each region one at a time.  The race types are pretty much what you would expect, nothing to terribly annoying or un-fun.  I am a big fan of drifting and the way the cars handle for the drift events is really horrible, they have too much grip and will just catch some grip and send you into the wall a lot.  It’s weird to get used to because you basically have to drift wrong to get anywhere with it, so I was a little let down by this. A lot of people just complain that drifting is in the game, and its “drift to win” but while actually racing there is plenty of cars that you don’t have to drift, you can still do perfectly fine with them and are they are quite a bit of fun.  There’s no cockpit view… yeah you hear it as the biggest complaint.  For me I got used to driving in bumper view way back from gran turismo finding it not only more of a sense of speed, but also better for nailing apex’s and having a good idea if you’re about to lose your back end, and save it before it’s too late.  I do however prefer to use cockpit view having played a lot of sims using a wheel, but this is not a big deal for me personally I do fine driving in bumper view and have fun with it. One thing that bugs the hell out of me is when you do a flashback it’s not replay mode like it used to be unless you completely total the car.  It was interesting in the last games to watch you’re crashes in slow-mo and enjoy the amazing damage model before resetting it back.  Also the AI are complete Asshats and smash the crap out of you all the time seemly for no reason other than for the hell of it.  It wouldn’t be so bad if you could actually get back at them, but if you hit them they don’t move at all.  It’s pretty damn lame and one thing I am yelling about all the time.  If they don’t want to race clean that’s fine, but when you can’t take them out for being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥than its pretty frustrating.   Also in terms of the AI the difficulty seems to be all over the place.  I started out at Medium and was having no challenge and bumped it up to hard.  Then the WRC races start and for no good reason other than to make it a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥the AI in front gets a massive lead and its damn near impossible to chase them down even if they are in a much slower car, it doesn’t seem to matter.  So the regular races are stupidly easy and the championship races are stupidly hard and you always start in the back.  If you can’t get up to 3rd in the first turn you can’t win in a championship race, and good luck getting past the AI that can’t hold a race line to save their life and if you are holding your inside line get ready for a pit maneuver or someone quickly moving in front of you so you smash the hell out them.  Overall, the game is fun, it might not be as good as the first grid, but it scratches the itch with not many racing games on pc that lean toward arcade when you want to just have some fun.  I see no point in going back to play grid 1 so this is perfect.  I would like to see some more customizing, buying parts, a little bit of tuning, I know this isn’t the style for these games, but I refuse to pay M$ for an xbox1 and I really miss Forza.  Also this DLC is getting out of hand and it has been for a long time.  It’s pretty much the price of a second game if you would have bought them all as they came out. Buying them in the bundle is a good deal, but it feels like it’s all stuff that should just frickin be in the game anyways.   "

												It's fun arcade racing game. Cars are very slidey and you need to drift most of the corners if you want to play optimally. Some people don't like it but I find it very satisfying to pull off series of turns while drifting perfectly.Singleplayer is racing on different tracks with few special events dropped here and there. It's nothing special.Multiplayer is where this game shines. You have experience level and you get money from races. You buy new cars with in-game money. If you're just starting out you're in bit of a disadvantange because you can't use all cars. Once you're about level 30 you'll have access to all the cars you will ever need. Multiplayer works fine and there aren't any lag issues. It's fun with many people but can get crazy if you have collisions enabled. Most of the matches don't have rammers and even if you get rammed in the beginning you can usually recover if you're a good driver. There are still many players during evenings. If you can't find any matches you need to change you steam download region to London. I think it's the best multiplayer arcade racing game on PC at the moment.That being said I can't wait for GRID Autosport. I expect this game to die once it's released.			"

												I love racing games, but not this one. It should be renamed to ""Spinout"", because every time you strike something with the side of your car, you spin out. This game had me raging. The lack of user customizable keys (there are only 6 functions to customize...there should be around 20), the inappropriately long load times, the long waits between everything, and the aweful camera view changes that occur every time you slam into a wall adds up to massive frustration. I am happy I got this + the DLC for $20 during the winter sale instead of full price. I honestly wouldn't pay more than $10 for what you get with this game. I find it to be insane that this game is considered a finished product. It needs an update, and fast!It is basically as though they made the game for a platform such as PS3 or Xbox 360, then just re-bound the controls for a keyboard. If this game were actually have been made for the PC, it would have a MUCH better user interface. The user interface it currently has is the complete opposite of streamline. There are too many unnecessary loading screens that have a lot of lag in them (my new gaming rig should not lag, and it does not lag anywhere else)However: Graphics-wise... WOWEE! Absolutely lovely. The physics engine is great as well.P.S. How can I have zero traction in first gear from a dead stop, but tons of traction in second gear while accelerating around a turn? When you play this game and spin out, you will see what I am talkign about. Well, that is if you can see through the unrealistically thick cloud of tire smoke -_-P.P.S. Don't Alt-Tab out of the game either. It resets ALL game resolution configurations. You are forced to reconfigure the screen size. framerate, etc. Just save yourself the headache and exit the game instead of Alt-Tab or the like.			"

												This is my take on this game. Some things are really good about it, but I have some things that I also really don't like. For instance, I love the handling feel of the cars. The environments are pretty good. I dig the story and WSR thing. Things I don't like about it: Nothing but visual customizations. No qualifying (always in 12 at the rear). No cockpit view. The hood view is best, but if the pain is glossy, it's overly done in a way that massive reflections that make cornering totally confusing. Stupid ""light-up"" arcade style arrows telling me where to turn. Overall, it's fun, but we really need less arcade and more simulation. I want a Forza or GT for PC. 6/10 stars.			"

												Racing realistic is it not, but fun nevertheless. It's on a 3D monitor {3D Vision] a good show, depth is there and taking corners and braking is very easy to do. The game has enough gameplay, hours of fun. There are moments if you play on the hardest settings that you need to do your best but it is doable.			"

												This game is excellent! All though theres no Cockpit view, it's not a game ruiner. I love the fact that theres more custmaztion options now, and it makes the game better in my opinion. The handling physics are also pretty good, the idea of drifitng around the track in order to go the fastest possible, is actually surprsingly good, and gives the game a great arcade feel to it. I'm not disappointed and am looking forward for future GRID titles. As a Reloaded edition owner, the DLC's are very worth while in my opinion, 50$ worth of items for just an extra 20$. That's a good deal. This game is one of the best PC games out there for the PC. My only wish is for Drag Races in the next GRID title.To conclude my review, the game is probably the best Racing Game on Steam. Keep up the good work, codemasters!Rating: 9.1/10 "

												I love this game. It's so much fun, and I love the full damage model.The game runs surprisingly well on really low specs, and looks absolutely amazing when set to its highest. Although the online leaves a lot to be desired, the single player and split screen are a ton of fun, especailly the customisation of your paint job.Some people may not like that there is limited if any customisation of your car's engines and stuff, but that means you can just get right into the racing. This has to be one of my favourite racing games so far... apart from Mario Kart DS, but that's not important right now...Buy it, it's amazing...			"

												Bought this game because I was a huge fan of the first game. disapointed with this one, the brake is useless as every corner can be mastered using a powerslide without even applying the brake. I'm no hardcore racing fan but sliding around every corner just gets boring after just a couple of races. its like it was made by a different developer to Grid 1. Just play the first one again.			"

												Poor sequel to GRiD bound by last generation technical limitations and focus on the casual market. The handling of cars have been oversimplified to the point of game breaking; the game's determination to make you ""drift"" around each and every corner, no matter how slight, means racing lines and skill go completely out of the window making each race feel very monotonous as very little is required of you to complete each track. The handling mechanics go beyond ""crap"" to ""ludicrous"" in certain cars and it's well worth searching on Youtube for a video of the Honda NSX on Grid 2 to see how♥♥♥♥♥♥poor the game gets in it's attempt at variation in car physics. The easy, uninvolving handling is complimented on single player with A.I from the playstation 1 era. The other cars will stick rigidly to the same racing line every race and inexplicable slow down near the end of the race to allow you to catch up if you've decided to play the game with your feet and found yourself in second place instead of first. Multiplayer is a mess when collisions are turned on thanks to the aforementioned car handling is coupled with the usual mindset of people playing racing games online where they decide to drive at you instead of turning a corner. When collisions are off, it's slightly better but again, thanks to the car physics, tracks are easily completed and winning comes down to who dribbles the least. The graphics are typical of a Codemasters game: very polished with excellent car models and lighting but very flat backgrounds and atmosphere which takes away from how impressive it could look. The developers admission of removing the cockpit view to allow them to improve the visuals explains the game has been developed with the 360 and PS3 in mind, meaning technical limitations a lot lower than a PC could offer and hindering the visual potential massively. The presentation of menus and loading screens is again typical of Codemaster: They're excellent and very polished but again, detrimental to the game. All the fancy effects and and wooshing about in menu screens means you'll be spending more time navigating for races rather than actually driving which is contradictory to what has obviously been intended to be a quick, pick up and play racer. GRID 2 can be summarised by what a user on the game's forums said: ""...made for the Facebook generation."", it's polished and glitzy but extremely oversimplified and has put so much focus onto ease of use for casual players looking for quick rewards that it's actually detrimental to what could have been a respectable IP if it hadn't strayed so far away from what made GRID 1 good.

												All arcade racing fans out there that don't own Grid 2 and are contemplating whether or not to purchase it,  at $10 this is truely a bargain.  The DLC's are worth purchasing as well!The graphics are brilliant, the cars and circuits are awesome and you get a great variety of tracks to race on, and there's also a free Demolition Derby DLC that will automatically be downloaded after purchasing the sim.In regards to the vehicles, it has a decent amount of cars to start with, however I strongly recommend purchasing all of the DLC's which aren't that expensive considering how many cars you'll end up in the game!Important note:  When I first purchased this game it was running fantastic with all the settings on high with my Intel Quad Core 2.8 Ghz processor (Overclocked at 3.8Ghz), then suddenly one day I went to play it and it ran like a dogs breakfast!  I spent a good month or so trying to figure out what the issue was, and I finally came across a very helpful person who gave me the immediate remedy to the problem!   Sorry for pointing the finger at you guys at Steam, but someone had at Steam had changed the compatibility settings under properties for the Grid 2 application by adding a tick to run it in Windows 8  compatibility mode! Once I removed the tick as recommended by this helpful gamer, the game was running brilliantly once again.Their are even a few mods on other sites that improve the graphics and make the cars handle more like the cars in a racing sim than an arcade racer.Note -  Overclocking is entirely your choice, just make sure you  understand the risks that are involved, and what is required to overclock your PC!  This is not something I recommend, nor do any of the staff at STEAM!			"

Posted: February 16, 2014
												The original GRID was not a favorite with fans of racing simulators, but in my view it trod the fine line between simulator and arcade very well. The successor has given up and gone with a limp, dull sequel.The driving mechanics of the previous GRID were perhaps a little forgiving, but subtle variations in car choice and the wide range of event types lead to an almost inifinite level of replay value. There was the strong sense of team progression, and a sense of adversity was found in the way that other drivers were named and recognisable, but never so important as to be 'bosses'. Instead, teams took that role.In short GRID was fun, casual gaming that alllowed you to tackle the same track 10 times and end up with ten completely different, intense outcomes without any feel of rubberbanding or jumping through hoops.Now, on to GRID 2. Having played a few hours of the game I have yet to understand exactly what the difference between the first ten cars is. There is an overwhelming focus on 'drift' mechanics. The first five or six cars were all classed as 'drift' even though the circuits are all allegedy street. I was actually quite excited to get the opportunity to try a car with 'balanced' classifications, however on the first hard corner I locked up the wheels and was treated to exactly the same on-rails-feeling drift mechanic as the other cars had provided. In short, this is the first major flaw with GRID 2: the driving mechanic is facile. Apparantly drifting is the way they want you to drive, and their idea of drifting is applying the brake and steering in. Countersteer is frequently unecessary. The clunky driver aids interfere with any attempt at deliberate over/understeer outside of this narrow definition, making all the cars feel samey (at least in my short time with the game).Beyond the fact that this is a racing game with poor driving mechanics, I feel that the rather pointless and restrictive story is another aspect that I rapidly came to dislike. Similarly the irritating focus on a social media-driven prestige system with kudos - I mean fans - as the currency, without any actual finance system or budget, meaning that you mindlessly plonk from race to race. Whilst driving the same car. However, these flaw would be liveable, if only the racing itself wasn't so crap. The 'top notch' AI is as pants as the driving, with very apparant rubberbanding, a heavy brake foot and none of the panache or daring-do of the drivers in the first of the series. Also, the damage system in GRID was regarded as forgiving. You've not seen forgiving until you've played this game.Before the review descends into a complete disappointed rant, I feel I should focus on the positives. Some of the levels are devastatingly pretty. Dashing along the California coastline through wooded clifftop roads in the morning sun was absolutely brilliant. Also, the gameplay mechanics really bring this to the fore as you don't have to watch the road as you drive, allowing you to soak up the glorious vistas. That being said, however, the city levels are bordering on the sterile. There is some sense of place, but very few of the city centre layouts provide the same level of white-knuckle experience and, strangely, do not look as good as the venerable predecessor. Whether it's the layout of the tracks, the less immersive sound design, the feeling that your car is wrapped in cotton wool or the flabby handling, the city racetracks do not deliver. Furthermore, I feel I should add that there is a game mode which involves the track getting switched around as you drive laps, which would be great if it was some kind of add on once you got to know, and presumably love, each track. Howver, being thrown into this mechanic after a few goes, without being given any preview or name for each layout, is bewildering and dull. Put simply, it heightens the feeling of banality introduced by the handling: driving at pace on a racetrack whose layout you do not know should kill you, not be easy.To conclude, do not buy this game unless you want something apocalyptically dull. I would even recommend buying the original GRID, flawed as it is, because it is a much better game. It even still looks good, and the experience of throwing yourself down a head-to-head midnight togué track has to be one of the most fun racing experiences I've ever had.			"

												While I really enjoyed the first GRID, GRID 2 leaves me wanting a lot more out of my racing experience.Make no mistake, this is not a simulator, nor should it be reviewed as one. This is an arcade racer with simulator-esque physics. What I mean is this: At the highest levels (Season 5 supercars, etc)Racing a ""GRIP"" car will feel slow, when in comparison to the other cars, you're going fairly fast.Racing a ""Balanced"" car will feel like you should be drifting a lot more than you are, but the car feels like it's on training wheelsRacing a ""DRIFT"" car will feel like your tires are made of ice and no matter what you do the car will not cooperate.I would prefer that my racing games fit into one category or the other when it comes to street racing (not DiRTs. DiRTs are awesome as-is)When a driving game with arcade steering has simulation knife's-edge cornering, I find it much harder to enjoy.TL;DR: The first 4 seasons and 25 hours are fun. Really fun. However, this game is dated enough that multiplayer is dead, so unless you plan on racing with friends in your living room/split screen, I wouldn't pay more than $10 for this game.			"

												Grid 2 is a great racing game overall. I believe codemasters games did a really great job on the graphics and car driving mechanics. however, i dont like that every time you go around a corner the seems to want to drift. i mean you have to be better than the stig to keep it from drifting. graphics are visually stunning and the damage mechanics are almost that of a soft body physics engine. i will note one problem is that the koenigsegg agera r likes to be a two wheeler in stead of a four wheeled car. the customization should be a little more like forzas and it lacks a first person view and open world exploration. i personally believe that they could have done better with this game. and at that i leave you all to your own opinion about it.

												It's hard to make a review for GRID 2 , long story short as for my taste and expectations I won't Recommend this. But don't let my review think GRID 2 it's a bad game. Why I won't recommend GRID 2 is , for Im more into Simulation Racing. Compared GRID 1 and GRID 2 , GRID 2 it's more of an Arcade style. What I hate most about GRID 2 is the constant oversteer which is actually aim towards for people who likes to see their car drift throughout the entire game. Which also casues bad experience for me as if you tries to turn bit harder your car will automatically oversteers and into a drift which is so unrealstic. I know cars tend to oversteer but not this freaking sensitive and easily. I would Recommend GRID 2 for those who are Casual Racers while those who are looking for a more realistic or simulation racing games best stay clear of GRID 2			"

												I wouldnt recommend this game to my worst enemy. If someone came up to me and said ""I need a really terrible game to play"" I wouldnt recommend it to them either..because this is something that goes WAY beyond terrible. If you enjoyed the first GRID and you're considering this, turn around...turn around and run as far away from this as possible. Mario kart is closer to the first GRID than this. Consider the GRID series ruined.			"

												Good fun game! The graphics looks great overall with some awesome scale to the tracks. The single player has plenty of depth and diversity as well as a semi structure story to keep things refreshing. Finally the multiplayer is amazing, I don't think I've played a racing game recently that makes it so easy just to jump into a race. It also has a bit of complexity behind to with car upgrades and car choices for each track/event type.Overall it is a great game, it might not be breaking any barriers in terms of design but it is a highly polished fun racer with a lot of variety.

												""Recommend""? Yes. But by the smallest possible margin.(On bad days, ""No""!) If Administration were better, this game would be aslam-dunk piece of awesomeness. But, it's not.Call it 2.5 out of 5 stars(average of 0 for administration, and 5 for driving.)TWO parts of Grid 2:-- administer the game, and-- play the simulator.In Grid 2, I count using the steering wheel, brakes, etc.  to drive acourse as Playing, and everything else (getting online, creatingraces, finding a race, quitting, etc.) as Administration.Playing is phenomenal (5/5 stars)! It just about balances out the rest of theproduct, because _everything_ else is a miserable, tedious, annoying,and frustrating experience, one which, had I known before purchase,would have caused me to look elsewhere -- anywhere else (0 stars).Here are a few examples:1. A race could take anywhere from a few seconds to hours (depending   upon settings and the point at which you arrived). A typical race of   a lap or two might take a minute or two to play. But, it takes   almost that long to start the next race. Literally, you are waiting   as much, or more, than you are playing.   Solution - I set longer races, 4 or 5 laps or more - though that   has it's problems, too. How long should a new arrival have to wait?   There should be no waiting for players to do stuff - such as while   looking at/changing cars. If I am joining the race, I should have   made those decisions first. If I am changing to a new car for the   next race, allow me to make a request (e.g., poke the F12 key   during the LOAD process), and THEN delay to give me time (e.g., 20   seconds so I can choose a new car). 20 second countdowns between   races is ridiculous!2. Sound stutters, especially between races when LOADING the next.   Put audio communication on a separate thread!3. User interface - certain things should be changeable on the fly.   I prefer to leave talking on (not Push-To_Talk). But, when the kids   start carrying on, or the TV, etc., I want to change this - worse   yet - when it happens at my buddy's house, I want HIM to change it.   But we don't because it means leaving the simulator, making the   change, then waiting until the next race begins. And that's   tedious!4. When a new race starts, show race characteristics:    Damage is on, Collision is on, etc.   I _want_ people to know race settings. Especially since I leave the   race open so anyone can join. And I want people to know that, if   they play crash derby, their car won't last any longer than the   ones they hit.5. Be consistent about behavior. For example, there should be an Exit   or Back option on EVERY non-race screen.    Much of the behavior looks like each Developer just ""did their own   thing"" when they designed and wrote the component.   For example, if at the Online race board screen, how to Quit /   Back?  Not mentioned (and it's an error in a lot of places, don't   just add it here, add it wherever it isn't!)6. Quitting the game can be a nightmare! I should be able to hit the   ESC key, anyplace in the game - even while racing, and see   appropriate Options, one of which should always be Quit. Sometimes,   I have to leave _now_. I don't want to argue with the computer   about whether I can shutdown now, I don't want to wait while it is   dislaying ""Longest Online Drift"". I want out, now!   There was even a scenario in which I had to finish creating the   race, then race it, just so I could Quit. Bad. Very Bad.7. When I create a game, I should be able to start playing it, even if   there is no one else to race [yet].   Right now, you have a huge problem - people can only Online-Race if   there are two or more people ready to race - me and my buddy. No   buddy? Then no race.   I'm not going to create a [custom] race because I'm not going to   sit there for an indefinite amount of time waiting for someone else   to show up. I can't race without them, and I won't wait for them.   Not a great Online situation.   I should be able to either race myself, or race the AIs, until   others arrive.8. When I am waiting, e.g., as a new arrival to a Race group, for the   current race to finish so I can join the next, I should be able to   Spectate. I want to do _something_ enjoyable while waiting, perhaps   several minutes, for the current race to finish. Right now, I have   to twiddle my thumbs, because the race in progress could take 1   second or several minutes (10+) to finish (no indicator).   If I walk away, I might miss the start of the next race, but, if I   have to wait, I might get so bored I write critiques of Grid 2.   An alternative to ""something to do"" is to allow me, as a new   arrival, to take over an AI vehicle, e.g., the last one.   I'd create a new option for game configuration:       New arrivals must wait for a new race, or       New arrivals may take over the last place AI car.   People should not have to wait!9. In the category of not waiting, At the end of a race, the program   displayes the finish-board, alternating with lap times. Useful.   Then it makes me wait while ""LOADING ..."" twiddles. No, bad!   One thread should be displaying the leader board, the other thread   should be loading the next race. (for the same old reason, Don't.   Make. Me. Wait.) Display the Leader board at least twice, but   otherwise as many times as necessary to allow the LOADING to   finish.10. Settings were at the ""intermediate level"".  I suspect a newcomer   to the gaming world would have some minor grief.  (In this case, I   might not call it ""bad"", just a ""lot of room for improvment"").   It was not always clear what or how to set things. If you have some   experience with this sort of thing, you'll figure it out quickly,   if not, choosing settings may be a bit awkward.   For example: Under Options > Controls, Arrow to the option you want   to change, hit Enter to put in change mode, poke desired button,   switch, or key to set. When all set, hit ESC to return to the   previous panel.   Anyone should be able to install the game, select a Help button,   and get the gist of how to do things, whether trivial like setting   action keys, or much more complex - like what the various options   in Create Race > Tier are.   You support the Logitech G25 - great! But, I can't seem to use what   are called ""Buttons 1-4"", button 4 is considered the default PTT   button, and it does not work (you'll probably want to set that to   button 8 so it's easily accessible while racing - if you like   Push-To-Talk). Why - is there something I must do? (they work in   other apps).In summary, this is a great racing game, from a racing / drivingperspective. And I highly recommend it based on that, but thatalone.EVERYTHING except the driving is an annoying, frustrating hodge podge,apparently designed and built by the lowest bidder; and if I had knownI would have all the problems we had before hand, I would definitelyhave looked elsewhere for a racing simulator.However, note that the problems I described above are the types ofproblems that can be ""easily"" fixed via a patch release. You don'tneed to change the racing process, scope new tracks, design new cars,reconsider the physics of the simulation. That's all done, andincredibly well. It's all the glue that binds the parts together thatneeds a [major] overhaul.Version 2.1, anyone? "

												All arcade racing fans out there that don't own Grid 2 and are contemplating whether or not to purchase it,  at $10 this is truely a bargain.  The DLC's are worth purchasing as well!The graphics are brilliant, the cars and circuits are awesome and you get a great variety of tracks to race on, and there's also a free Demolition Derby DLC that will automatically be downloaded after purchasing the sim.In regards to the vehicles, it has a decent amount of cars to start with, however I strongly recommend purchasing all of the DLC's which aren't that expensive considering how many cars you'll end up in the game!Important note:  When I first purchased this game it was running fantastic with all the settings on high with my Intel Quad Core 2.8 Ghz processor (Overclocked at 3.8Ghz), then suddenly one day I went to play it and it ran like a dogs breakfast!  I spent a good month or so trying to figure out what the issue was, and I finally came across a very helpful person who gave me the immediate remedy to the problem!   Sorry for pointing the finger at you guys at Steam, but someone had at Steam had changed the compatibility settings under properties for the Grid 2 application by adding a tick to run it in Windows 8  compatibility mode! Once I removed the tick as recommended by this helpful gamer, the game was running brilliantly once again.Their are even a few mods on other sites that improve the graphics and make the cars handle more like the cars in a racing sim than an arcade racer.Note -  Overclocking is entirely your choice, just make sure you  understand the risks that are involved, and what is required to overclock your PC!  This is not something I recommend, nor do any of the staff at STEAM!			"

Posted: February 16, 2014
												The original GRID was not a favorite with fans of racing simulators, but in my view it trod the fine line between simulator and arcade very well. The successor has given up and gone with a limp, dull sequel.The driving mechanics of the previous GRID were perhaps a little forgiving, but subtle variations in car choice and the wide range of event types lead to an almost inifinite level of replay value. There was the strong sense of team progression, and a sense of adversity was found in the way that other drivers were named and recognisable, but never so important as to be 'bosses'. Instead, teams took that role.In short GRID was fun, casual gaming that alllowed you to tackle the same track 10 times and end up with ten completely different, intense outcomes without any feel of rubberbanding or jumping through hoops.Now, on to GRID 2. Having played a few hours of the game I have yet to understand exactly what the difference between the first ten cars is. There is an overwhelming focus on 'drift' mechanics. The first five or six cars were all classed as 'drift' even though the circuits are all allegedy street. I was actually quite excited to get the opportunity to try a car with 'balanced' classifications, however on the first hard corner I locked up the wheels and was treated to exactly the same on-rails-feeling drift mechanic as the other cars had provided. In short, this is the first major flaw with GRID 2: the driving mechanic is facile. Apparantly drifting is the way they want you to drive, and their idea of drifting is applying the brake and steering in. Countersteer is frequently unecessary. The clunky driver aids interfere with any attempt at deliberate over/understeer outside of this narrow definition, making all the cars feel samey (at least in my short time with the game).Beyond the fact that this is a racing game with poor driving mechanics, I feel that the rather pointless and restrictive story is another aspect that I rapidly came to dislike. Similarly the irritating focus on a social media-driven prestige system with kudos - I mean fans - as the currency, without any actual finance system or budget, meaning that you mindlessly plonk from race to race. Whilst driving the same car. However, these flaw would be liveable, if only the racing itself wasn't so crap. The 'top notch' AI is as pants as the driving, with very apparant rubberbanding, a heavy brake foot and none of the panache or daring-do of the drivers in the first of the series. Also, the damage system in GRID was regarded as forgiving. You've not seen forgiving until you've played this game.Before the review descends into a complete disappointed rant, I feel I should focus on the positives. Some of the levels are devastatingly pretty. Dashing along the California coastline through wooded clifftop roads in the morning sun was absolutely brilliant. Also, the gameplay mechanics really bring this to the fore as you don't have to watch the road as you drive, allowing you to soak up the glorious vistas. That being said, however, the city levels are bordering on the sterile. There is some sense of place, but very few of the city centre layouts provide the same level of white-knuckle experience and, strangely, do not look as good as the venerable predecessor. Whether it's the layout of the tracks, the less immersive sound design, the feeling that your car is wrapped in cotton wool or the flabby handling, the city racetracks do not deliver. Furthermore, I feel I should add that there is a game mode which involves the track getting switched around as you drive laps, which would be great if it was some kind of add on once you got to know, and presumably love, each track. Howver, being thrown into this mechanic after a few goes, without being given any preview or name for each layout, is bewildering and dull. Put simply, it heightens the feeling of banality introduced by the handling: driving at pace on a racetrack whose layout you do not know should kill you, not be easy.To conclude, do not buy this game unless you want something apocalyptically dull. I would even recommend buying the original GRID, flawed as it is, because it is a much better game. It even still looks good, and the experience of throwing yourself down a head-to-head midnight togué track has to be one of the most fun racing experiences I've ever had.			"

When you play it, seems like it's incomplete, the feeeling of being a real driver, competing for money and sponsors has just been lost, your car never turns without drifting and it gets worst when you realize that you just earn cars and more just winning events.It's almost a whole new game, nothing compared to the first game. My tip is: Stay playing Grid 1 or buy another racing game.			"

												...Sigh.  So much potential, only to be mediocre, bland, and uninspired.  I'm buttmad about the removal of the helmet cam, and the vehicle physics are extremely odd.  Not to mention the AI seems like it was taken straight out of Twisted Metal or Rogue Trip, as their primary objective seems to be to murder you, instead of finishing first.It's decent, and only decent.  It tries too hard to be two things and it fails at both; it is neither a redline arcade racer, or an intense sim experience.  Everything feels watered down and stripped, including the car roster.  It would be a little more forgivable if they gave you more cars in every class to play with, but as it stands the roster is very ho-hum and forgettable.It's a little sad, because the mobile game Real Racing 3 feels more like a true sequel to GRID than GRID 2 does.

												This game is sincerely great, gorgeous, the LiveRoutes feature is not only a success but a feature that should have been around eons ago. Fantastic car selection (the R34 Z-tune and the Caterham goofy-sounding mini Le Mans are standouts), and plenty of tracks - the touge tracks in Japan are as sparklingly gorgeous as the Dubai downtown routes. Watch out for savedata corruption however; do yourself a favor and disable Steam cloud synchronization.			"

												Pro: very enjoyable, many cars available (especially with DLC), easy to start with (auto-tuned difficulty), bumper view just perfectCons: strange physics (if you hit a car, it doesn't move while when a car hit you, pray to stay on track), lack of customization (technical parts), sometimes frustrating, external view without speed impressionWhile being nice to the eye, Grid2 is quite strange compared to Grid1, which managed physics rules more fairly. After 10 hours of playing, I have to admit I enjoyed this title for, let's say, 80% of the time while the remainder was full of frustrations. Where is car customization? Why do AIs have so many advantages over the ""poor"" human player? Why your car does feel light as a feather whiler opponent's weights tons?Anyway, had you played Grid1 - and liked it -, this one really worths it. Let's hope that sequels will have some improvements anyway (not tested the new one, though, I'd give it a try when I change my Hardware ;-))			"

												I bought this game a few weeks after its release. I enjoyed the first Grid game and played it for hours buildingup my team and customising my cars. The instant I started up this game, I was initially filled the excitement, wanting it to be as good as the last Grid game, but I soon lost love for this game in the first few races of playing it. Every car seemed to be set-up to drift and not actually go round corners at high speed, gripping the road. But it's far from it. I only played this game for about an hour or so. The game made me feel like the crapest driver in the world, even on easy difficulty i couldn't come close to getting first.I've played many racing games, Forza 3, Forza 4, Forza horizon, the original Grid, WRC, Colin Mcrae and so on. At least in those games io could come first even on moderate settings. Ijust couldn't get into Grid 2, so I stopped playing it.A year later I thought that I'd give it a go again. But it was the same story again. Every car drifted, AI just drove straight into you, like they didn't even knwo that you were there.I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, and I'd advise anyone to stay well clear from this game.

												ONLINE GAME PLAY-Grid2 is pure arcade. The fastest way around a corner in the Grid2 universe is to approach the corner at full speed and throw the car in sideways, sliding all the way around (although this is different to the drift technique within the game). This technique is hard to grasp for some people who are used to real world physics resulting in hugely varied skill levels making online racing boring - no close racing.I found if I created an online game and invited friends who did not have the same downloaded content as me (even if I didnt select race settings that use the downloaded content) my friends could not join.I like the in game voice chat. While loading new races it would break up a little, but I guess that's to be expected.Finding an open online game is near impossible. It is region based, so you cant join a game out side of your region. i.e. I can only join games hosted in Australia.All of the people I race with are 30 plus, some with families. So they don't play regularly, the problem with this results in a very slow climb in XP points and cash, which allows you to modify your vehicles or buy new ones. In this respect I wish all cars were available from the get go in online mode.CONTROLLER SETUP -I use a Logitech G27 steering wheel and pedals controller. I had to download and install the Logitech profile software, tweak settings in there and then tweak settings within Grid2 for the controller to feel 'right'. It took a lot of mucking around and research, which was a little annoying. Once setup, it was great.In game sometimes the controller would not respond correctly. Seemed like the calibration was lost, but a restart of the game and controller power cycle would usually fix it - annoying if you've just hosted a game and need to quit the session to reset your controller. This would happen to both me and a friend with the exact same controller.CONCLUSIONOverall its a great game. I've had a lot of fun playing it online with friends. "

												Bought this game when it was on sale a while back.  I have the original Grid game for 360 and loved it and decided to get this game after buying a PC racing wheel.  This game is pathetic compared to the first.  Almost all the cars are only available through DLC.  While the tracks are interesting and the support for force feedback racing wheels is a plus, it's still very disappointing.  Graphics are ok but the physics and damage models are pathetic.  Overall I wouldn't recommend this game at sale price, much less at full price.  Grid 1 is much, much better.  Can't say I'll be buying anymore from them.			"

												Grid 2 delivers everything the first Grid game has and more.  I'm a racing game fan so this was on my list of games to get  when it was released.  One thing I liked about the Grid racing series is the car damage as it relates to the gameplay and the feel for the car to the track.  There's a nice variety of issues that relate to hits you've taken on the car and it does effect your ability to drive and finish the races.Grid 2 is gamepad compatible and configureable.  Display options include varying views of first and third person so you can play whatever is comfortable.  Graphics are top notch.  I'd put this game up against the 'Need For Speed' series any day.  I found the control of the car itself was better in Grid 2 than in the 'NFS' series games.  Drifting seemed easier in Grid 2 because the control of the braking was manageable  with regards to speed and handling.A good story line that keeps you doing different racing tasks that include test drives, promo events, to actual racing circuits, etc.  The game lets you choose what you what you want to do... so you're not dragged into their format for play.  There's sponsor objectives to farm  for which allows you to replay tracks and try and get different objectives and time scores.  Just a fun racing game... when you buy it on sale.			"

												A well-curated car list, a great sense of speed, and a clever career mode combine in a fun, confident racer. It's not Race Driver: GRID, but it's GRID 2 and it knows how to entertain. It takes some time to become challenging and it's a mess full of useless DLC, if you are not into the brands or cars offered. The Race Driver series has changed but it still deserves a chance, especially after the bad outcome of the Dirt series.			"

												After buying GRID 1, I feel like I should change my opinion about this game.Compared to GRID 1, this feels like the Shortened Version of GRID 1.No cockpit view, the narrator is terribly tedious, less cars, extremely lack of car customisation.AI in both games are stupid, but since GRID 2 is newer, I really expect the AI to be a lot better, nope, not one bit however.This game is not a racing simulator anymore, its just an arcade racing game, unrealistic.The money system is replaced with a fan earning stuffs. It's not really fun you cannot use the fans you earned to do other things like buying vehicle, it's pointless.This game is really good; I really tried to like the game, got all DLCs, but no.It lacks too much thing in the game, and I refused to like the game.Buy it only when it's on a huge sale.

Just DL it and you'll have a cockpit view or bonnet view).Really nice graphics and sounds.Since I have a racing wheel, I am starting to play other racing games and it's quite easy to play them since Grid 2 makes you a better driver.

												This game looks quite gorgeous.  The graphics have had a real step up, there's some really good paint options available, reflections look amazing.  This would be a great game as long as all you ever do is look at it.As soon as you start to actually play it, that is where the game begins to fall apart.  The key to GRID 2 is simple:  Drift.  The first tier of cars you obtain in career mode, every single car in season one - even with DLC - is a Drift car.  And there's a reason for this.  Once you finally do work your way up the ladder, you do tart unlocking other cars.  But even with other control schemes, ""balance"", ""grip"", there is only one way to take corners with any speed:  Drifting.And even this wouldn't be as bad if it had the same more realistic drifting controls as the previous game.  But this game doesn't.  Not by a long shot.  While it may be better than the infamously bad Ridge Racer series, Codemasters has decided to throw away all pretense of a ""racing simulator"" and give us crappy arcade drifting physics.  Every car will under-steer unless you hit the breaks to throw the back end out.  Every.  Single.  Car.  Every track is made for drifting around sharp bends.  Every race expect you to drift if you want any sort of reasonable time.  Simply put, if you aren't drifting, you aren't winning.On top of that, the career tournament, sponsor, money/reputation system of the previous game is gone.  Replaced with a ""social media"" story, complete with ESPN interludes (who've proven they will do anything for a pay check whether it has any sense of reality or not).  You win races to earn ""fans"" (reputation).  Cars are just given to you, you choose between usually two - which are either virtually identical in stats or one will be a clear advantage - and you can unlock the other in a time trial.  The goal of the game is to impress drivers from other racing circuits to join your racing circuit by beating them in races.  Let me put that another way:  The goal is to impress enough fans that your brand new, all-styles racing circuit is totally for realsies by attracting drivers that you, personally, have bested in their own circuits, on their own tracks, against their own specialties.  And now you want to race them off type, off class, and against each other to give credibility for your fantasy league.  Yea, this is so much better than just, you know, trying to earn trophies from existing events.On top of that, the AI has taken a huge step back from the previous game.  Whereas in previous game, drivers had skill sets, they had favorite types, and - most importantly - they made mistakes, here we are back to AI that was laughable twenty years ago.  They follow their racing line.  They drive a little slower if they're out front, so that you can catch up, and a little faster if they're behind you (rubber band AI).  They don't care if they hit a wall, they don't care if you're in the way, they don't care if you try to spin them.  They will stick to their racing line and that is it.But wait, there's more.  In their infinite wisdom, Codemasters has added a few new race types, and of course removed some old favorites.  One of the new events, Live Routes, is a race track that is dynamically altered as you race.  In other words, you have to picture that there are people who, once a few cars go buy, run out and reset the direction of the track.  Constantly.  In a game filled with unrealistic, idiotic choices, this one takes the cake.Edit:  There is also the dreaded, obsolete, should not be seen in any video game post 2000 checkpoint racing.  This was a mechanic invented for arcade machines back when you had to continually put quarters in them every 90 seconds in order for them to earn money.  You have a time limit, and each checkpoint adds a little bit to it - not enough to get to the next point on its own, so that you will eventually run out.  It has absolutely no place in home games.  This mechanic needs to die.  Even though it is used here slightly differently than in the old arcade games, here it's set up as an actual competetion - which is probably the best use you can make out of it - checkpoint racing has left such a dirty taste in my mouth from so many games that I just cannot respect any racing game that includes it anymore.  This isn't the only thing either.  Elimination, the way they have the ""5 second rule"" to Togue.  This game has completely forgone ""simulation"" for ""arcade"".  While some players may like that, having race styles that can only really be done IN a video game... After the first GRID game, this is not at all what I wanted to see in the sequel.  I have no problem if that's the game that they wanted to make... but it should not be titled GRID 2.There are better racing games out there.  If you haven't already played the first GRID, go give that one a shot.  The cars there feel good, the game looks good, the races make sense, the AI is competitive, and most importantly, that game is far more FUN.  But hey, at least you can have pearlescent paint if you buy this one instead - though you can never remove your sponsors.			"

												Well, i have seen so many bad and good reviews about this game. But only one thing i see bad about this game... IS that it doesn't have the same realistic feeling like GRID. GRID 2 is more arcade but still a lots of fun. Multiplayer is great too.. But i have purchased it recently thanks to 75% Sale. With all ""DLC's"" (forgot to say this is a bit funny, dont know if its good or bad) But there is a lot of people putting low levels to T5 races disabling DLC so you can choose only one car (Mercedes McLaren) and they pick something like ccx. And thats not fair...+1) Lots of fun and Hours of gameplay2) Well optimized so even low wooden computer like mine can take it.. (Please take a note that i have HP ProBook 4540s with AMD HD 7650m and Intel core I5. So I'd say something like limit but you can go lower is as mentioned AMD HD 7650m or nVidia GT HD 550m wich have nearly the same performance.) .. On low graphics3) If you are lucky you can even enjoy Multiplayer ;)-1) Isn't simulator like Prequal and doesn't have Cockpit camera2) Multiplayer isn't balanced3) Graphics didn't move so far from GRID but thats good for people like us who still have bad computerAnd that's it :D I think that if you're not interested in this game but you are looking for good Racing Simulator, go for GRID..But when you want action, arcade, adrenalin. Give it a go and buy GRID 2And if you are bit dissapointed with this Sequal to GRID, then give it atleast a try when its in huge sale and buy it :D Its fun anywway.Thanks for reading and good gaming ;)			"

												A big disappointment.I enjoyed GRID a lot, so naturally thought its sequel would bring me joy too. Unfortunately and after giving it much of a chance, I really don't enjoy GRID 2. The fact everything is about 'drifting', even the non-drifting events. The handling is pretty off compared to realistic racers, and is pretty stupid compared to other arcade racers so I'm not sure where it's supposed to fit in. Obviously all the dull 'city' tracks are not realistic, and some of the modes such as 'Endurance' which basically changes the layout of the track as you drive around (to try and prevent you learning it, but the AI know exactly what to expect) are unrealistic, as well as the whole WSR concept.The only real positive I had from the game was that the multiplayer was entertaining in the beginning, and compared to other CM games such as DiRT and the F1 series, as least you weren't forced as much to watch useless scenes/forced into a race before you'd even set up your controls/graphics etc..I'd try GRID Autosport as apparently that is the resolution to this poor game, but the series has left me with a bitter taste.

												If you played Grid, and want to give this game a try because you loved Grid, I would not bother. Because that was me, and I was pretty disappointed by this game. First of all, if you don't have a steering wheel, this game will essentially require one. Also, this game was really designed for kids. The driving is like Need for Speed: Most Wanted, where every turn is a drift and you will eventually just be moping through the game. There are actually too many cars; there too many cars that noone cares about, if that's better. I spent 11 hours to get to classes that aren't even remotely different from the starting class.The graphics are better, to an extent, but way less detailed as Grid. Grid was also way more satisfying, because they also removed the cockpit veiw. The maps are way less interesting and are a total snooze fest. The maps in Grid were better. Way better. I also hate the guy who does things over the mic. He's annoying. And he sounds like he's talking to a 10 year old.In short, this game is meant for a totally different age group. I wouldn't recommend it to any fellow gamer, but maybe for thier kids.			"
