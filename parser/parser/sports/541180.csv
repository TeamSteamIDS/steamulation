												Played one match, here is my takeaway from it. If Konami decides to give us the lesser version of the game next year, they might as well keep it off the platform. This is embarassing. The character models look atrocious. The gameplay is good, possibly superior to FIFA but it takes an L everywhere else. Definitely not recommending this game. Plus they skipped out on Data pack 2 apparently for PC. Complete downvote here.			"

												I would not pay 30+ Euros for this game but since MyClub is the only mode i want to play this trial version is exactly what i need. Gameplay even if its not perfect. AI might be a bit better but all in all its totally ok especially if you keep in mind you dont have to pay anything to play the game. I focus on playing vs AI and some games vs other players (short tournaments, weekly events). If you only want to play vs other players one thing should be said: there might be some lags and its delayed depending on where the other guy lives and his internet connection, which really sucks sometimes. All in all a good game though. Its a bit better than PES2016. Give it a try			"

												A good game with some issues that Konami need to fix. It's basically a F2P version on myClub and that's great! Konami should probably update their title to show that. Now gameplay is classic PES, Feels much better than Fifa and you have a lot more control over the ball. The ball feels nicely weighted and moves along the grass nicely. There is no overpowered lofted through balls or crosses for easy goals you have to play from the back and build up your attack. There aren't many players atm (around 2,000 at peak times) But even with only 500 players online it only takes me around 1-2 mins to get into a game. Usually it's good matchmaking with good tight, and close games. The servers aren't amazing. I've gotten on a few times with the servers down for some reason but the issues seem to be fixed within 30 mins or so. So no real problem there. Now this game is based around the 360/ps3 version of PES 2017 and I have no clue why. Konami have been doing this for years with their yearly PES editions. It's the main reason why I do not own any PES game in my Steam libary. Give us the Xbox One/PS4 edition Konami please! Our PC's can handle it! Like just look at the system requirements, They are around 10 years out of date. Give us some improved graphics and shadows. Also can we have more options than low/med/high. I can run it on max settings @1080p/60fps sure but it would be nice to be able to turn off some options we do not want. Overall a fun game which I can see myself putting in several hours aslong as there are players to play against. I'm not quite sure why there are so many negative reviews of this game espically when it is a free to play game.			"

												The main attraction here is exhibition mode and what you get for free is pretty good value. However, that mode is limited to like 9 teams .... It'll get old quick. Gameplay wise, It's not very fluid for a soccer game as PES has always been. Nonetheless, it'll sooth your soccer itch for free and you can try before you buy. Personally, this doesn't make me want to buy the full version.			"

I only downloaded this version because of the PES League and I can't even enjoy it. KONAMI try and fix your servers so online gameplay can be smooth.

												I have a great connection, played with a level 3 connection player, I think it means my adversary has nice connection like me, so we played great until, in the second half, my screen turned black, and it showed the connection worsened and then I lost, it said that wasn't nothing wrong with the other player, that I unplugged my internet cable or something like that, I lost some points and then I uninstalled. Anyway it's free to play and I didn't invested any money so it's even, I guess.

												I haven't played much of this version, but there things to say even before playing it.I understand people who are angry at KONAMI, and I am one of them.On the other side, I will try to point moments that would be impossible if KONAMI did everything we want them to do.1. Licenses: Many people blame KONAMI for not getting licenses for leagues, clubs and national teams. It makes me upset, but doesn't make me angry, because it is not KONAMI who doesn't want to buy licenses, it is teams, leagues and countries who don't want to sell them. And you should probably be angry on certain league or team who has exclusive contract with FIFA. (Juventus and Real Madrid, for example didn't sell the license to KONAMI this year, because EA SPORTS got exclusive license from them.2. Graphics: PES 2017 is old-gen on PC, and this is very frustrating for people who have high-end PCs. I have a high-end PC and I am very upset about KONAMI not giving me the next-gen game. KONAMI is not evil here, because the reason behind going old-gen is because they want more people to be able to play it on PC, and it would be absolutely fine if they don't sell it for 30-40 gbp. This is the price of AAA next-gen game nowadays.3. Gameplay: PES 2017 is Football Simulator.4. PES 2017 TRIAL EDITION:  First of all, it is FREE. Secondly, you could see how KONAMI wanted to create a f2p game that lets people go competitive. It didn't work quite well last year, because MyClub cannot compete with FIFA Ultimate Team. They have decided to give people competitive gameplay system called Leagues, and I think it suits PES better than MyClub (UT clone) did. PES is simulator, and the main part of this game is GAMEPLAY. MyClub is competitive just the same way as MMORPG games are. Going F2P League mod, makes PES competitive in the way Dota 2 is. You download and lauch the game on your potato PC (because it doesn't even require high-end PC) and you are good to go and play with other people.5. SERVERS: all I can say, is servers are better than ever. I love that you can choose matchmaking lvls. (choose to play against opponent only with certain level of connection)6: COMPETITIVE FOOTBALL SIMULATOR: For me it is a huge step forward for KONAMI, making footbal competitive online, but many more things need to be done in future to polish this F2P edition.   *  I would love to see better match making system. It would be amazing if people could join the match, have some time to ban 2-3 teams, and then pick. *  I am not sure about this one, but I remember PES 2013 had online tournaments, you could enter during the day. It would be amazing to have it in this version.Finally, please ignore reviews like ""bad game, blablabla"". People who are reviewing this game here in Steam. At least try to list the problems of this game when you downvote it.Don't look at that ""Mostly Negative"" sign, and don't read bad reviews, if you want to play football simulator, competitively against other people ONLINE FOR FREE, go ahead and give this game a try. This is the unique game, and you will not get the same from any other game.			"

												i think the only reason konami realeased this trial edition is because they know the full game is ♥♥♥♥ and is not worth the 20$ it costs. i played the fifa 17 demo, and i have to say that it is waaaaaaay better than this. i expected much better, but it really seems out of fifa's league. it's weird you released it for PC, it's almost uncontrollable. you better get a console and pay for fifa 17, it's better and smoother in almost every way. the only good thing about this game is konami actually lets you play myclub and online, and even that is not much original or different than fifa's ultimate team. i wrote this review because i want to warn you about this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, and tell you that if you do like the PES series, then get this, but don't waste your twenty bucks on this dump.

												Been a while since I have played a PES game. Really seems alot slower than back in the glory days. I think They have focused to much on slowing it down. The feel of passing and shooting the ball is, as always, per-♥♥♥♥ing-fection, but sadly the heavy clunky player control lets it down. If they could scrap the whole ""it's slow and there for tactical"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and go back to fast responsive players even at the cost of ""realism"" with players turning with the ball quicker then PES could really offer a strong alternative.Shame they will always have to use false names though.COME ON YOU EAST DORSETSHIRE !!!!!!!!

												No, it's doesn't include MyClub like last year f2p PES 2017 MyClub..It's a PES 2017 Demo version + PES League (aka Online competition mode) for free...The only common reason for them to release it is just to have more players to compete in online matches as they try to do an eSports stuffs with PES. Go for it if you like play online... i just want to play and build my team in MyClub.. which is not in this edition.			"

												PES 2017 is still a great game.The game's goal keepers are a  lot harder to beat. Mini games are stright out pes 2016.I was going to get the game but saw this and thought its as good as for now. I have not been online yet. Thats where all the negative feed back has come from.Single player is great. Turn up speed settings one notch. "

												After taking some time in this trial version all i can say is Thank you konami. Yes, it has flaws but it can be perfected in time. First i would like you to allow us to skip all the replays at once in the after match screen. I know it's not too much but it would make the game much more fluid. It would also be nice to have a quicker menu, the loading times are not big but they slow the time to do your things. All in all i say this is a well Done product. I will update this in time, as i progress in the game and see more of it.EDIT #1 : I've found out that pressing the start key (for keyboard is V, don't remember exactly what it is called but it used to be ESC back in the days) will take you out of the highlights so you don't have to keep pression enter.EDIT#2 : The scouting system is fun and there are many possible combinations to try. It feels good having an alternative to agents that offers the player more control over their team building.			"

												I had to edit this review,because now they finally realeased MyClub on this Trial Edition mode,now finally i'd recommend this game,but still needing a lot of fixes by the way.Konami haven't add a dedicated servers for the online game mode in pes yet.The connection is p2p which makes most part of the games unplayable and with a lot of delay.I still thinking that MyClub mode has a lot of potential,but the fact that most part of the matches are laggy makes the game bad,but i would recomend the game indeed.

												Pro Evolution Soccer 2017 Trial Edition is not as limited as its name suggests.The game offers pretty decent gameplay, acceptable graphics, great performance on all sorts of hardware and hours of potential love-hate relationship with the multiplayer. The controls are fun, the game offers some interesting options to create your tactics and even makes a record of the most prominent traits of your style of play, which are then showed to your opponent prior to each match so that they have a clue of what kind of player they are about to compete against. The focal points of this edition are undoubtedly myClub and PES League. There are also offline modes such as 'Exhibition match' and 'Skill training'. 'Master League' and 'Become A Legend' are not included in this version.There are various ways to score a goal but it has come to my attention that headers seem to be a bit overpowered, which is something that will hopefully be fixed (however unlikely) in a future update.The matchmaking options are diverse, giving each player different levels of restrictions to fit their pre-match requirements. In my case, at least, I have not had serious connectivity issues with players that are located within the applicable restrictions (level 1 matchmaking restriction). When these restrictions are turned on, however, the matchmaking stage takes a bit longer than some players' patience. Admittedly, when the matchmaking restrictions are turned off, the opponent usually comes up a lot sooner, but should that opponent also happen to play at a distance of about 11 000 kilometers away, the lag that follows kills the fun of the game.As a free-to-play title, the game relies on microtransactions. However, I would say that it is not pay-to-win. The in-game currency is also obtainable through other means such as achievements and login campaigns but is not vital for your success in matches.In my opinion, despite the mixed reviews (as of the time of writing), I believe that anyone interested in the game should give it a try. After all, you get a solid game for free.			"

												I recommend because it's free...the shortfalls it has can be forgiven because...it's free.Some really good bits:Dribbling past defenders requires skill and time to master, you can't just mash the sprint button with a fast player and dance through people like children trying to catch an adult. I like this.Passing success can be variable, more so than FIFA. I like this.It's enjoyable to play, 80% of the time. I like this.The bad bits:Shooting + the goalkeeping, mixed bag, unless it's 100mph from anything more than 5 yards out, the goalkeeper saves it, if you volley or half volley from any position, anywhere in the attacking half it flys like a ""worldy"" and either just misses or forces the keeper into a wonder save, the ball is on tracks.Now, the worst bit, AI. If a ball comes out and your Player A is going to be nearest to the ball the comp will auto select the man for you (standard), if for whatever there is a deviation in play (a mild deflection, unexpected spin etc) even if the ball falls next to your player B's feet, he won't touch it, and player A will run the length of 3 olympic swimming pools to get that damn ball, because it's his destiny, and if he doesn't, bad things will happen, maybe to his family, I'm not sure, but that ball cannot be touched until he has Linford Christied his way accross the field, nothing will stop him. This essentially make the game feel far too forced, like it is on rails, it will decide for you what will happen. This happens to a less extent during play, short passes intended for a certain player renders anyone else in that sequence look like they've never seen a football before if it ends up with them instead, often running in the wrong direction or just fumbling around like a homeless person.Would I buy it? NoDo I play it? Occasionally when I need a football fix, as I refuse to pay for FIFA as its gash.I cannot for the life of me understand how Konami, after making some of the best football games ever, over 10 years ago (Pro evo 6, ISS PRO etc) can take steps BACKWARDS, baffles me.Oh and the graphics are shazzbat, port.
