												So far it's fairly fun.  The only gripe I have is that there is no difficulty setting, and the AI opponent is flipping amazing.  I've played 3 games so far and only scored 3 points, total.			"

												It isn't bad, probably it's much more enjoyable if you are a real player of pètanque/bocceGOOD- nice gameplay- play against the computer is a good challenge- a sport announcer FIFA styleBAD- graphics outdated- you can select only two male characters and one sport stadium- no skills system  7/10			"

												If you enjoy Bocce Ball then you will likely have fun with this game, or if you enjoy casual gameplay then you may like this as well.  I did a First Impressions/Blind test recently on Youtube and found the game had a bit of a learning curve simply because I am not overly familiar with Bocce Ball.  Overall I could see myself playing this with friends once I got the chance to test out the multiplayer modes.  The single player test I did was super difficult.... I got destroyed by the AI.Possibly, and most importantly, the game ran smoothly for me in windowed mode and fullscreen mode in multiple different settings, so that's a good sign about the parts of the game I have yet to test.The one con I would say, is the price tag.  I feel like this game would be better suited for a $10 USD price tage instead of $20.  When we can buy games like Rocket League for $20 it's difficult for me to say this game is worth spending $20 on.*Full disclosure - I was given a copy of the game for testing / review video .... I am honest with my thought and opinions and if you wish to see the many videos I make be sure to take a look at my Youtube Channel....

+ Pretty casual, and easy to learn+ Great ball physics+ A variety of way you can throw the ball- I felt like the gameplay was too simple- AI difficulty was a bit too high, my opponent always seemed to get incredibly close to being perfect- The audience are a bunch of props who don't move or cheerOverall, it's a pretty good simulator and I enjoyed what was in it. If you are a fan of Bocce Ball you will likely enjoy this game. "

			Hey Guys, and Welcome to the most intense bowling game ever played. It’s Bocce ball on steroids. It’s a super fun super intense sport game that works great on PC and has a amazing announcer.		

SummaryAmazingly Fun and Intense. I had a general idea of the rules, and playing the simplified rules allowed me to start right away and have a blast. Its truely a great game for both people new to Bocce and Bocce Experts. High praise to Dysotek for this game, Expecially loved the Commentator. My match was so fun, so intense and I barely edged out the computer. This made it both challenging and rewarding.			"

												Do you love Bocce ball? If you do you might have some fun with Bocce Revolution but otherwise I would avoid it.The graphics are pretty bad. They are reminiscent of the PS2 era of games. Gameplay is what really matters though. The gameplay is decent but has some issues. The gameplay works fine but it is not very challenging or engaging. The game uses a simple power meter and has nothing to determine accuracy. Since the power meter has little symbols on it that indicates the position of the balls already in play you don't really even need to guess how much power to put into a throw. If you really want a Bocce ball game you may have some fun with Bocce Revolution. Otherwise I would stay away from the game. Note: I received a free review copy of the game from the developer.

												Ten Pin Alley. Hotshots Golf. Bocce Revolution. In the long line of accessible sports games that use a power meter to simulate how much force you're applying to a ball, it's not a comfortable thought that Bocce Revolution is leading the vanguard into the future. That isn't to say that this is a terrible game. If you want nothing more than to play bocce with a friend or against the computer, and to play either a single game or a best-out-of-five tournament, then have at it. God knows the market is underserving the bocce crowd. On the other hand, $20 for this seems really steep because all there is are those two modes and some physics that don't quite feel right. Maybe I'm wrong about the physics, maybe they're fine, maybe it's just that there isn't any sound effect for when the ball is rolling across the court. Maybe it's that the aiming line seems to be consistently off, somewhere between five and ten degrees to the right of the ball's actual path. Maybe it isn't the physics as much as it is the crowd's triangle faces, and the two textures and hairstyles that are recolored and repeated across them. Maybe it's that there is only one court and it's inside, and there are windows that look out onto a blue sky of a strange hue. Maybe it's that the only sounds in the game are the kind-of-loud music, the interface sound effects, an announcer who says bizarre things like ""the competitors have the sport carved from their DNA"", and the occasional knock of wood-on-wood when a ball hits another ball. Maybe it's that the crowd is silent and motionless. Maybe it's that when you pitch your ball, your sportsman goes through the motion up to the point where the ball would leave his hand, and then instead of leaving his hand it actually teleports to a starting point somewhere below it and then starts rolling. Maybe it's that the singleplayer is against the same AI player forever, just a single AI stuck inside some man in an orange tracksuit. I can play a single game against him, or I can play a tournament against him, but it's always him. Maybe it's that the multiplayer is only local, as if I wanted to sit in my room with my friend and play a game of bocce that is stuck inside another room, one filled with a blankly staring audience and an announcer who remains professional in spite of obviously losing his mind. Maybe it's that the court looks totally flat, but seems to have a slight concavity towards the center. I don't know. I just couldn't stand more than 20 minutes of it.			"
