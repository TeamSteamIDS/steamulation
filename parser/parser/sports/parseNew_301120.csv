Early Access Review
								(9.6 / 10) Well worth the eight year wait - Author: archibalduk of EHM The Blue LineMore than eight years after the Eastside Hockey Manager series was put on indefinite hold, the undisputed king of ice hockey management is back. A lot has changed since EHM 2007 was released in September 2006; not least the rise of the likes of Steam and social media. These platforms make niche games cheaper to launch and easier to market. Indeed, Eastside Hockey Manager: Early Access (or EHM:EA for short) is being released exclusively on Steam and is likely to be heavily marketed using platforms such as Twitter and hockey forums such as The Blue Line and HFBoards. Against this background maybe, just maybe, the game will become a more viable project than it was before.This new iteration is being released as an Early Access game. The game will be continuously developed over the coming months with regular updates being pushed to users via Steam. To call it a beta version would be grossly unfair and inaccurate. The game is highly polished. It’s simply that the game will be developed whilst we play. The thinking behind this approach is to test the waters. If the game generates enough sales then it will return as an annual release. If not, then it won’t.Full Review -> http://gmgames.org/eastside-hockey-manager-early-access-ehm-ea/review/ "

												I'm giving this game a negative review despite loving it. The reason is that I want to draw attention to the negative sides that I don't feel get mentioned often enough.First of all, there are still bugs in the game. After so many  itterations, one would have thought that things like trading and contracts would work flawlessly, but nope, you'll still run into situations where you need a save file editor or create another GM just to get the game to follow hockey rules.My other and biggest issue is with the way this game compensates. Let me explain. I've been playing EHM since the very first version, probably spent thousands of hours on all versions together. One thing you have to realize is that this game is essentially a numbers generator, working with probability and such. Thing is, if you've been playing this game long enough, you'll find ways to build fantastic teams, with (probably)  the best coaching staff in NHL history and you can pretty much win the Stanley Cup with any team by your second, in a worst case scenario 3rd season. But! The game detects when your team or player start producing extraordinary numbers, and it will start compensating to keep things ""realistic"". Won too many Stanley cups in a row? Well, you'll lose in the playoffs, no matter what you do (tested by replaying the same saves when things got weird on countless occasions). You'll win with the same team next year, but the game won't let you win, say 4 times in a row, just because. Same if your team is scoring too much. Built a scoring machine with 1st line level players on your 3rd line? Well, bad luck, because you're gonna get punished by periods where your team will refuse to score, until your goals scored total returns to a ""normal"" value, then, without changing anything, you score again. Same goes with winning games. Winning 90% of your games mid season? Well, here's a drought, it'll end once you're around 75-80%, then you'll dominate again and the cycle repeats.Bloody hell EHM, let me build super teams if I want to, don't punish me for finding ways to work the system. Sheesh! What's the point in learning to play a game if it will punish me for that and promote mediocrity?Otherwise, I really enjoy this game and I value the work they put into it, it's a great game, but the compensation system can be incredibly irritating.

								I had never played EHM prior to yesterday, I had followed the NHL afew years ago but had only recently watched ice hockey during the Olympics. The reason I gave this a go was because of its low price and the fact it seemed on the face of it similar to Football Manager. Whilst daunting at first I quickly got to grips with the interface and the basics of the game, whenever I hit terminology or anything I was unsure of a quick google was more than enough to gain an understanding of what I need to know.If you're someone who enjoys Football Manager but would like an alternative to play I'd highly recommend it, especially at the price it's at. If you love hockey then this should be a no brainer.I'd also highly recommend downloading roster updates and graphcis packs should you get the game to give yourself a more complete experience!			"

												Excellent game for anyone wanting to be the gym of their favorite team and bring them a stanley cup(except for the Maple Leafs, that's impossible pls). If your favorite teams are the oilers, hurricanes, panthers, hurricanes, etc, it will take a few years to get the Stanley cup. You need to build the team with good depth players, have good rookies in your system, and a decent top 6. Time will fly as you are trying to build the perfect time. There's a lot of depth in this game. You can control coaches, scouts, practices, analysis the draft, team tactics are really detailed(there are individual tactics for each of your players and also for each of the lines you can either choose or ask your coach).Overall, this game satisfy my constant need of hockey when there is no game to watch.

												I'll list out what happened to my team in history and you be the judge. NOTE: This was after loading the real league DB- Selected the Flames- Had a mediocre first year. Ended up 4th last. Wideman was a superstar!- Was able to Draft Austin Matthews 4th overall. - Young stars played well but asked for small bridge contracts (3.5 for Gaudreau and 5 for Monahan) in the end.- Was able to trade assets like Juri Hudler and Jonas Hiller for young stud prospects like Kerby Rychel, Oliver Bjorkstrand and John Gibson- This salary dump and low contracts allowed me to get Jamie Benn of Free Agency for 3 years at 8.5 mil- Existing Flame prospects Poirier, Klimchuk, Anderssen and Bennett started to shine.- The next year with these players resulted in an early playoff exit against the OIlers, with Poirier getting the Calder trophy on a line with Monahan and Gaudreau. Damn you McJesus!- The second year ended up losing in the quarter finals to the Stars who went on the win the cup with Voracek in place of Benn, Klimchuk started to whine about his ice time and the Calgarian Media.- The third year, refused to comment to media about our chances and won the cup in dominating fashion. Majority of players were in that 24-27 sweet spot. Gibson won the Conn Smythe. Hartley won the Jack Adams- The following year, couldn't afford Benn despite letting an old Wideman go to free agency, Matthews wanted 5 mil a year. Managed to get 35 year old Pavelski and 31 year old Simmonds on sweet deals in free agency. So far, I'm 3-5-2 though. Feeling the cup hangover as there has been LOTS of little injuries to start the season and a T.J. Brodie 3 game suspension.All things considered. The game is fun, largely accurate, though not fully believable in some aspects. The free agent list is obsurd. The salaries that some quality players are asking for are rediculously low. High end talent costs a LOT in dollars (8 million plus). The salary cap never goes up. There are some bugs regarding team record notifications that make no sense and are poor english. Some menus are tedious to mantain. Trade system is fairly good. Scouting is annoying as it doesn't auto reset for Entry Draft scouting - scouts go idle. I'll likely play another two seasons and stop forever, but worth it if your a GM junkie.			"

								Let's assume you've never played the EHM-series and you like hockey. In that case - the game is just for you! You can make your own God-awful decisions like an actual Oilers GM! How cool is that!Well.. kinda cool. Yeah.The EHM-series was created by the Finnish Risto ""Riz"" Remes and picked up by the SI Games (Sports Interactive - Football Manager [the ol' Championship Manager] and OOTP-baseball-manager-thingye). That's how it's been for about fifteen years or so. And it's awesome that the few that enjoy manager-games that are just basically Excell-sheets with a bit of graphic.The game is awesome as it was in the year 2006 (?) when EHM-07 was released. And quess what? IT'S STILL THE SAME DAMN GAME! The engine is the same and the mechanics work the same way. It even has the same glitches (the junior players refuse to sign to the team, the international games happen at the same time as the European leagues etc). Ok. The year is now 2015 in the game or something like that, but nothing much.Don't get me wrong - I love the game. I actually bought it three times when it was the crappy Sega-distribution that allowed you to install it three times and three times only. (So when you must re-install Windows - there goes one licence. Oh yay). Now it's yours eternally when you buy it from Steam but that's prolly the biggest change in the game.I know it's still an early release (though 10 years old), but I really hope that the developing theam has the courtesy to update the game A LOT or it's just a cheap way to make some money.Summary: You like hockey? You hate the way EA handles the managing-bit? Bored of Maso Hockey Manager? Yeah. This is for you. Prepare to be annoyed, though. The game has a few bugs (ok. new bugs that weren't in the earlier version, so that's a feature for the old-timers) and a cheap feel to it, but as a managing game of hockey made in the UK - it's pretty ok. Worth your money, but hopefully offers a lot more in the future.			"

								Before I start the review itself, let me start by saying that I'm part of the potentially big group that started liking ice hockey on their youth due to the Mighty Ducks trilogy. Yes, I'm one of those. And yes, you can imagine which team I'm playing with right now, the Mighty Ducks.That said, here goes the review.GameplayThere's not much to say, considering it's a management game. Being from a well known developer, mostly known for the Football Manager (FM) series, you can expect to find some FM similarities. Any ice hockey fan, with an interest for managament games, will enjoy the game and will most certainly spend hundreds of hours playing it.The gameplay is just you'd expect from a managament game, allowing you to set tactics, practice, and take care of the team's transactions. You'll also be able to lose yourself with all the statistics avaiable, trying to find that change that will allow you to tweak your tactic. But don't think for a second you can just grab all the big guns and ram your way through! You can also scout for prospects and develop them, so you can later use them to win the cup, or just use them as a bargaining chip.It's your game, your team, your choice. Until you get fired.Pros Plenty details; Good trading and contract system, considering the AI doesn't scam you, or lets you scam them; Quick booting and load/save system; Has a nice number of leagues, and hopefully more will be added soon; The match engine is quite good, and entertaining, with a few minor problems (see cons section); Good tactical interface, with a lot of options that can make or break your streak.Considering it's Early Access, and they're open to suggestions, and also considering by the end of its EA state will be most likely be as polished as the FM series appears to be, I'll reduce my cons to what I've found in the actual game so far.Cons Sometimes the players flip out a bit on the 2D engine, and either just stop for a couple second, or during penalties and faceoffs they just ram into each other until they find a way to go to their spot, so the play can start; UI could be a tad bit better, as somethings are harder to find;  To withdraw an offer after all the parties have accepted you've to right click the player's name and manually withdraw it, as there's no ""Cancel"" option on the news screen, just a confirm option.VerdictI'd give it a 9/10 considering it's EA status and the series long hiatus. Tons of potential.If I'm not mistaken, they don't have the licenses yet, but you can easily get a ""fan made"" database to ""fix"" that. "

								Like many Early access games, people tend to use the word ""potential.""   EHM EA is no different.    The difference with using the word here is that this is a reputatble company, with a development team that has a huge passion for hockey.  There are some advancements from EHM 2007 but it still is very close to the same game currently in terms of features.    The AI is improved, the regen system has changed and development seems better so far.   All the old bugs are fixed, I have yet to come across any new bugs and the stats so far seem more realistic than 07.Although the more I think about it the more I'm saddened that SI wouldn't commit fully, It's better than nothing.   It's finally back (sort of) and hopefully will stay for a long time!   Thanks Riz!EDIT:   Expect the game to crash.  Again it is WIP, so far the first season in each of my games works just fine but after that it can be hit and miss.   I'm sure will be patched rather quickly.READER BEWARE:  Most of us have waited 8 years for this moment.			"

After downloading the newest roster update from TBL, it feels almost as if I picked up right where I left off last time I played EHM 2007. However, for new players the game still has a very difficult learning curve. More detailed explanations of game features, statistics, etc would go a long way to helping more players understand and enjoy the game.			"

												What I love about manager games is to take a small team and build it up to greatness. Sadly, that's not possible in EHM - if you don't own your arena (small teams won't) you can't expand it and you can't build one and thus you can't build up an income. Some teams will even start with 0 ticket price, so you'll never get money from home games (which means you'll never have any money - you won't go bancrupt, just no possibility to invest or pay salaries).There are also bugs and a distinct lack of customization - hopping between different info screens because if you combine them you get 2/3rds of the info you want. Graphics and sound is poor, not that it matters to a manager game but it feels really outdated.I wish this had been in early access still, because then there would have been a decent chance of some of those issues being fixed. Right now I fear that the game was released and abandoned.			"

For players who played FM or Eastside before i recomend human managers to impose some restrictions on trading. Trading over and over again will result in a super team to fast.There is an old fansite up and running for easside called blueline who have living forum,updates,roosterpacks and graphics. The community there is very helpful mature and social.A price for this product under 40€ is a must buy. I got hundreds and hundreds of play hours from my game.			"

One of the most notable improvements is of the interface. It's a lot cleaner and easier to navigate. The ""Game View"" option is also nice. It's fun to be able to follow the game as it goes and make changes as needed.I recommend that you download the roster, logo and player picture updates from TBL. It makes the game more fun to be able to play with real players and teams, rather than made up ones.As noted by other reviewers, the one thing that should be improved is the tutorials. For people that have never played the game before, it might be tough for them to pick-up the game and play.			"

								After an 8-year hiatus, EHM makes its return via early access and while the game is very similar to its most recent iteration, that does not hinder or ruin the experience in any way.  As an early access game, this is a very polished and solid initial effort.For those who haven't played EHM, the game is a text management sim where you take complete control of a team and attempt to use your skills as a general manager to take your team to glory.  As the game is in early access mode, there are no official licenses or real players.  However, www.ehmtheblueline.com has a very nice roster set, logos, and real team and competition names that provide that.  Unlike NHL by EA Sports, you are the General Manager and do not control the players during games.  You sign free agents, hire coaches, scouts, and of course, trade as you desire.  Additionally, you can set your lines, practices, and tactics.  You also can promote and demote players between minor leagues and choose how to build your team.  As you're unable to control your players directly, tactics are very important in helping you win games.  The games themselves can be viewed via 2d mode where the players appear as dots with the puck, similar to the initial offerings of Football Manager 8 years ago, before it went 3D.  The game engine is solid and provides a decent way to watch games and observe your players.  The minor gripe I do have with the game engine is that it does look dated especially compared with how SI has evolved its Football Manager franchise.  Having said that, the fact that this game was developed as a side project by SI mitigates that gripe somewhat.The menus are cleaner than EHM 2007 although again, not as intuitive as the newest Football Manager games.  The other issue is that the game can only be run in one resolution which means that newer screen owners will not be able to view the game on a full screen.  Hopefully, that will be addressed in a future update.If you love Football Manager, Out of the Park Baseball, and text sims, you owe yourself the privilege in checking this game out.  For $14,99, you simply can't go wrong.  The more people that purchase this game, the more likely we will see official licenses and future releases.  If you're an armchair hockey fan who thinks, sleeps, and drinks hockey, you definitely need to check this out.  Disappointed that your team continues to build around a questionable core?  Fix it yourself in EHM.  You won't regret it!			"

												I have just returned to EHM recently because there was so much I missed when I tried to play That Other Hockey Manager. For example, I miss watching the pixel circles run around the ice surface, so I could actually see at least somewhat what my players were doing on ice, and get a sense of personality from them that you just can't get from repetitive text. I missed a tactics layer that made sense and was easy to use (which EHM has), and a trade system that made sense, and an interactive scouting system that made sense, and all the great rosters the guys at the Blue Line keep making. I just missed all that. It took me a while to figure out a hotfix of my own to get the game running on Windows 10, which is frustrating (I love Steam, I do, but why can't you guys be more like GOG and make the games playable before you sell them to me)... but once I did, I fell in love all over again.EHM is a game I have played almost more than anything...more than Civ 4 and 5, more than XCom... EHM put me to sleep at night, head nodding over my little laptop in years gone by, because I just couldn't stop until little hours of the morning... and it still gets me that way. I lost a whole morning with the Canucks today trying to decide if the McCann/Virtanen gamble was worth it, or if I should send them back to juniors.... and watching Vrbata miss shot after shot...it was just like real-life Canucks hockey!So here's to you, EHM, and your amazing creator. I suspect, by the quietness of the updates, that EHM on Steam may not have a long, vibrant life full of changes and improvements (I'm looking at you, more on-ice graphics, because I remember Wayne Gretzky Hockey 2 and 3), like that Other Simulator is getting, but until That Other Simulator figures out how to show on-ice play, and simplifies and streamlines tactics and lines and coaching, I'll be keeping this on my computer and playing it until I fall asleep at the keyboard.

								I'm having an amazing amount of fun playing this game!  There are a few minor things I'm waiting for them to implement, such as salary retention on trades, but mostly this feels like a finished product to me.  I will say though that I hope they put a lot of work into trade realism before the full launch.  It's ok as it is, but could definitely be improved.  The other main thing that I'm hoping gets fixed soon is the swarm of good players making it to free agency.  Way too many.  But overall, this game is so good that I just cannot stop playing it!  I wholeheartedly recommend it to any hockey fan!			"

												This is a must have for any hockey fan and a stat freak. Just use the community stuff and enjoy real players, teams, leagues and so on. The implementation is really easy and since I started to play again, since I am a EHM 2007 veteran; I don't eat, don't work, lost my girlfriend haven't slept.. but won the championship. Because it's the cup. One of the minuses though would be the difference between the EHM 2007 and this one is almost none. For me it doesn't matter much, cause I enjoyed it before. But still.Too bad I don't have much time to play it			"

								It's been such a long time since this title had a major revolution, and it's finally here, a much needed retool of this much loved product. i have only just downloaded it and gave it a whirl, but it has a feel of what should have been done to begin with, or should i say it's what it needed back on 2006 when they released it pre version.I will say, it's still kinda sluggish on loading, and very work in progress feel to it, however i do appreciate it's a pre release and much has yet to be done to it. i also would like to see some new features on the staffing side, more participation by the board with trades, such as more pressure to get players, and more negotiations with board with the financial side, such as how much a player is worth in trades. i feel also scouting should be harder, and be far more specific to what your search requires, such as takes longer, and a better stat wise scout will get ""much"" better results. head coaches should be able to reject trades, and also suggest trades with other teams on the home page. for example ""head coach"" likes a ""certain player"" on a particular team, and we should maybe go on an offer for him.i do feel however it has much potential, and there is alot of excitement on this release and i can see it being very populer with hockey fans.

												You probably already know if you want EHM or not. If you aren't a hockey fan, and if you don't like pretty deep simulation-based games, there's nothing for you here.However, if you like those two things, EHM isn't perfect, but it is the best option in the genre. Sports Interactive know what they're doing, and EHM is no different, although it is a little barebones. It's a shame that, for what is ostensibly a new game, there's no modern features such as achievements. Thankfully it does have Workshop support, and it's here we see EHM's trump card.EHM's modding community is what, for me, pushes the game from standard sports-sim to something engrossing. Real-world rosters and clubs, as well as facepacks, allow for something more realistic - and thus, fun. For me, trying to turn my beloved Calgary Flames from perennial bottom-feeders into an actual force is far more enjoyable than doing it with a fantasy club, with fake players. Without these mods, EHM is pretty sparse.On its own, EHM is a tough sell. Even with it's fantastic mod support, it caters to a pretty small niche. If that niche includes you, though, you'll be treated to a game that demands time and patience, but yields great reward.			"

												tl;dr - still plays like Early Access; minimally supportedYes, I got my money's worth. Yes I was enjoying it. At this point, it is on the shelf until improved. I would love to play more but will not. The reasons are below.A very flexible game that let's you be the General Manager for a team at almost any level of hockey. You manage coaching staff, scouts, players and contracts. You can coach at a very detailed level or leave those details to the AI. Many features will let you play your way.Even though the game has a lengthy manual, much of how it works it not explained. This is one of those games that you need to figure out and google. You will learn about hockey and how it works. You will learn about how hockey works and how this game is different.I learned the game and the many options. While I found it acceptable, I also find it falls short in some important design areas.For example, here[community.sigames.com] is a long list of possible enhancements for the latest version 1.1. You can see in this discussion that the developer is not aligned with the reality of their game (regarding salary cap). This shows a lack of thorough design.When I first bought the game at version 1.0.2, it would frequently lock up. There was a work-around where you could ""go on vacation"" to get past the day with the error but you were then missing the simulation for that day. This error was fixed in 1.1.1, more than two months after release. This error was related to simulating many leagues when you play and again shows a lack of thorough design.What finally made me put it on the shelf is that after being fired from my favorite team and working 7 game years and more than 300 actual hours to return to that team, it is not possible to GM the team because my old history is not reset upon re-hire. This means the team has no tolerance for my presence and is a hair away from firing me as soon as I start the job. Again, something that seems like a lack of thorough design.So even though it is version 1.1, I would label it 0.8 or 0.9. It's close but not yet ready for long term playability.edit: I've noticed that they only tend to support the game for about a week after a release. There is a release about once a quarter so there's not much support. Here is an example.[community.sigames.com]If you do end up buying the game, save often, it still locks up pretty frequently.			"

												*** UPDATED REVIEW FROM EARLY ACCESS ***It's gotten much better since Early Access.The reason why I love this simulator is because it's constantly being updated, and it also has a Workshop hub which isn't even something I originally predicted this game having. The fact that they're doing literally everything they can to incorporate as many fixes; features, and updates with rosters, teams, and even more proves that this game will be timeless for quite some time.But again, it is only a simulator so if you want the real hockey video gaming experience sadly you got to shell out the money for a PS4 and copies of EA Sports NHL every year. Every bug I've ever seen has been patched quickly, every feature I've wanted besides a few have been already put into this game. Besides no means of easily adjusting Salary Cap, Rosters, and Attributes between Playing and Non Playing staff this game has basically everything needed for a proper hockey sim. It's expanding to more and more leagues, and they even update the rosters regularly.It's nice to see a game having such support for such a small fanbase, even the Workshop has all the facepacks you could ever need. So far it's kind of a slow start out of early access, but this simulator has limitless potential in the long run.Graphics: 10/10Everything is aesthetically pleasing and as cohesive as it needs to be, with the Workshop addon it's easy to get the team logos you want without much fuss. I've ultimately no complaints with the GUI, as everything works as intended and should.Engine: 9.5/10The speeds are as fast as they've ever been with as good looking of a GUI as you can get, completely optimal in every way. Injuries for some reason seem more reasonable, but still far too common. There must be an option to either increase or reduce chance of injuries, because I feel for the entire NHL league they are FAR too common.Customizability: 6.5/10The game is fairly basic even now, as I previously mentioned in my Early Access review there's no real way to edit the leagues completely. I'd love to be able to add, edit, and delete teams from leagues just to experiment around with them. Usually simulators like this will have a sandbox-ish feel, but I feel fairly limited to original concepts which doesn't really have a ""refreshing"" effect if you think about it. It'd be nice to at least edit rosters, and staff however - you can import EHM 2007 databases which you can edit at your own will but to be frank that's quite a bit of a hassle. Some more open modding support would be awesome as well, or at least - more settings to tweak. Few more complaints is there's no way to edit rosters, staff, salary caps, etc... It feels less like a ""Manager"" more like just a ""Be A GM."" This isn't to say the simulator isn't accurate and doesn't meet it's intended purpose, but Simulator and Sandbox are something that go hand-in-hand. Especially when you're trying to make things interesting, and have fun with different ideas. I raised this to a 6.5 from a 6, because a lot of the bugs preventing personnel customization and hiring were fixed (like hiring physio's + scouts from players.)Interface: 10/10Though the resolutions you can use do not have the ability to be custom, there are new selectable resolutions! Basically all the standard resolutions, but it's so nice being able to just play 720p on my third monitor. The GUI is quickly responsive, and very intuitive. Easy to learn after a few clicks around, and nice to look at. I use the minimal GUI without pictures, background images, and news images to speed up the sims a little. Still looks great, and runs very smoothly.Functionality: 10/10Although some of the resident errors still pop up every once in a blue moon, there are no crashes I've found yet. You can usually just mash right through the errors and the game will still continue to no fault, it's a rare a game can just work through errors so I have to say these devs did a spectacular job with this simulator.Sound: ?/?Sound isn't a necessary or objective need in a simulator game, by any means and will not be counted towards the score.Overall: 9.2The workshop support is astounding, hopefully some people will make some addons relating to being able to edit rosters; salary caps, etc... very easily. Being hoinest this will probably be the closest I ever give a review to any game being this close to it's objective ""Perfect 10."" The support is awesome, rosters are residually updated and tweaked. Bugs are fixed commonly, and so far the game lives up to expectations and standards and even exceeds. Being honest I can only imagine this game getting better and better with time. It's not common that a game will have the ability to be timeless, but a simulator like this probably could being given the right amount of ""Tender Loving Care"" or ""TLC"" as it ages.tl;dr: This STILL was totally worth the $15 I spent on it, in short.

								I'm a huge FM and hockey fan so I'm amazed I've only found out about this series today of all days.  I've only played a few hours but so far I'm liking it.  It's got a lot of promise and has some really good elements from the FM games.  The screens are easy to navigate and the stats are easy to find and read.If you buy this game make sure to download updated rosters from The Blue Line as this is not a licensed game (yet).  You might also want to download graphics and face packs to enhance your experience.As Early Access games go this is shaping up very nicely so far and I am more than happy to support this franchise.  Hopefully development continues and we get some really cool things implemented.  There are already buzzing forums containing wishlists for the game so I'm really looking forward to what the future holds.TLDR: If you are a sports fan/hockey fan and also like Football Manager you will love this game.

												This is the best game ever! I remember playing this as a kid back in the day. When I saw it was coming back just over a year I go I was excited to be back at it.There are several things that could make this game even better:1. Better player interaction - team meetings and 121 talks with players would be a bonus.2. Better contract negotiations.3. Being able to arrange friendly international games.4. Being able to hold training camps for lesser teams (  the elite league doesn't allow them but I know the teams have them prior to the start of the season ).5. Forming new affiliated teams.On a whole this game can take hours of your life it has with mine and it will for many, many, many more hours. I recommend this game to every hardcore hockey fan, and anyone who would like to get into the sport.The league coverage is huge especially in the British league. We aren't the most skillful league but they have the top 6 leagues in the country all playable.With just a few tweets and this game could easily take over my life! "

								This.I've been waiting for this for eight years, as many of you have. I've racked up hundreds of hours getting teams of young guns to reach the mightiest of prizes, the Great Lord Stanley's Grail. Countless nights of sleep were sacrificed when came the real season: so many sodas... so many chips (crisps, for our friends in the UK). Bathroom breaks were (unwisely) postponed when my Habs played the Bruins (almost systematically) in legendary first-round skirmishes. Meals were skipped. Assignments were botched. Life, however, uh, found a way.And now, thanks to the dedication of the people at SI, I can rejoice (at long last) the return of the Prodigal Son.I've only played a few hours thus far, but I am ecstatic! This is no beta test, this is a very polished, very stable game and it delivers. Plus, with the help of the just-as-dedicated people of TBL, there is a fresh, up-to-date roster pack waiting for you to be savoured. I don't think I could thank them enough for their generosity for the past eight years, nor would my words amount to their work. I will say that the resolution (fixed 1024x768) is my main irritant, but it is in NO way a major source of irritation; it is merely an attempt at searching for a ""con"" amidst a very impressive number of ""pros"".You're a hockey fan? Get this. Now. 16,99$ (yeah yeah, the Canadian dollar took a drop) is ridiculously low for an early access of this quality.			"

												Not an incredible sim, but a damn good one. With Workshop mods you can effectively create the NHL and all other relevant leagues with some minor differences (No salary cap inflation and arbitration) but you still have access to all the things that make strategy relevant in sports (Salary cap, personnel, trading, free agents and practice schedule). This game leaves you surprisingly free to do what you want, from managing/coaching your team and it's farm affiliate to simply being the general manager of a team and letting your coach handle the strategy and game day line-up. After 3 years the game runs out of prospects in the draft and does use randomnly generated players, but this is unavoidable and does not hamper the games quality. The learning curve can be a little steep but after a hour or two I caught on quickly. I highly reccomend this game to hockey fans especially and sports sim fans in general.			"

If someone finds no teams logos or players photos a problem , you can visit ehmtheblueline.com , where you can download latest rosters and logos.

Early Access Review
								I don't usually write reviews, but this game is already so good and still has such great potential, coming from a die hard hockey fan, I love this game. Pros:Scouting - Scouting mission details can be changed like player age, position, or ignore well known players/prospects, and it really helps you find the players you need, whether you're playing as Arizona stocking up on talent, or Detroit looking for a diamond in the rough, or Montreal and you are looking for some proven foreign skill to boulster your roster for the cup run, you can find the players you need. You can also generalize the scouting by assigning a scout to a continent, or country/nation, or you can assign him to individual leagues, you can even assign a scout to a particular player if you'd like.Game simulation- You can choose to simply speed up games to get it over with, or you can watch the game real time and make tactical changes, line changes, etc. Line Changes/team tactics/unit tactics/player tactics- Wow. Just great. You can change defensive zone strategies, neutral zone defensive strategies/positioning, neutral zone offensive strategies/positioning, forecheck, breakout strategies, offensive zone strategies, and of course special team units like PP and PK. You can choose which player is le playmaker of the line, choose who takes faceoffs (which is great I'll explain further in), etc you have absolute control of your lines. You can also change individual tactics, so if you have two offensive players and a power forward on your first line, you can change the line to not body check often or hard, and not be aggressive, then go to your power forward individually and make him check hard, play aggressively and with a high tempo to balance out your line, or set a defensive type of player to shadow an opposing player and keep him in check.You also have control over practice so you can train what coaches do what (coaches have attributes like coaching defensive players at 17/20, but then he might have 11/20 for coaching forwards and a poor goalie stat as well, so make him only handle defeinsive training. I believe it helps, clarification would be nice though. You can make certain player focus on an area of the game that maybe he is weak at, or boost what he's good at even more. You can have signing bonuses for games played, points, shut outs, etc.Those are a few things that stuck out that I likedCons:Now, I know you want it to be hardcore simulation, very in depth etc. But damn, it takes a looooong time to get through seasons. I want to go outside and do♥♥♥♥♥♥still, and have a life. I like it being in depth. Although I have quite a bit of time played, I find it extremely hard to get in to when it takes me like six hours or sometimes longer to finish the season. Just make an option to set a date a date simulate up to it. I know that's like EA NHL's simulaion, but it does work good. Or at least a quick sim game option. I know it might ""dumb the game down"" but the players that don't want it don't have to use it. Not everyone has time to play for six hours, although it's so good I have played for even longer in one session before. It may also interfere with game longevity, so I guess it's a choice the devs need to make. I really hope that isn't an option already that I haven't found lmao.Player Overall and progression- (My only semi-major gripe about something wrong/broken with the game, not having quick sim is not wrong/broken, it's just not included)This is pretty simple to understand why it must change slightly... I will have great prospects for the future, but they are young and only really strong in the physical category on the far right like speed, strenghth etc. and since they are so strong in that category, they have a four star ""current rating"" so if he's playing in the AHL he will be unhappy because he's rated four stars, but then I call him up, and he's a complete liability on the ice, and he does poorly in the big league, and his potential may drop or he may not grow properly. The worst part is, if you don't call them up they will get unhappy and eventually request a trade and in some cases not resign a contract so you just lost out on a valuable draft pick simply because he was being a cocky bigot (imporper use of bigot ik) that thought he was the♥♥♥♥♥♥ then his hopes got crushed and blames it on me. If there's a way to fix this, I'd love some clarification, maybe I'm the only one with the problem. That being said, the rookies are in no way broken lol, this happened in a few particular cases. but maybe make it so that certain statistics count more towards your current rating and others less, physical category should have the ""least say"" in the current rating. Also, maybe have an overall stat or at least break up the stats into better catagories like defensive, offensive, physical, it is sort of like that but then teamwork is in defense (could be in both but offense makes more sense IMO) and stick checking and positioning is in offense so it's a bit odd when figuring out what type of player a player is. I don't really like the player type system either and how it changes. I draft a rookie and he is a playmaking offensive forward for 2 years, then he grew one year and he turned into a two-way. Maybe have a current player role and projected player role like what sort of player he will be at his peak (which you can alter using the practice system), and not just a comparison to an NHL player. I saw you did so in the most recent update, although I think the player/prospect progression could use some more tweaking. Although I have decent time played, I'm still learning so if I have gotten anything wrong I'd love an explanation on how a few mechanics work:) and I know it's early access so it's not fully complete, but it's already a great, complete game in my book. I recommend this 100% to anyone thinking about purchasing. My Vancouver Canucks did great in regular season, and got swept in the first round by a division rival. 8/8 realism. Love the game, looking forward to updates. Would continue to play even if you didn't update.:) Sorry for the long review. P.S. I'd rather spend 60$ on this rather then the 60$ I spent on NHL 15 on ""Next-Gen"" (lol) consoles.			"

												Tips for a fun game:- Limit yourself to one (or even zero) UFA acquisitions per year. This is a very easy way to beat the game- Hide player attributes and read scout reports instead- Dish out realistic contract offersThe game is a lot of fun if you try and keep things realistic. High recommended.			"

												My first management game. I did try GM mode in EA NHL but it was frustrating and lacking in depth. This game has TONS of depth. More than you will probably use but it's there anyways. You can add in custom rosters and with tools, add and modify players. Multiplayer has just been added but I'm looking forward to it and I think it will add another dimension to the game.			"

Early Access Review
								Gotta say, I wasn't expecting this much from this game:It's an incredibly detailed Hockey simulator that says ""Early Access"" but besides some UI changes that could be made, looks like it could be a full-blown game right now. It's a game that is easy to lose yourself in and you know you want to come back to play it once you've shut it down. Even though right now the game doesn't have actual NHL rosters in, it is incredibly easily to download the real rosters and facepacks to go along with it. The Blueline website does a better job than EA has ever done on their NHL games at updating their rosters; you can expect an updated roster almost once a week during the regular season from the website. There are a couple of problems with the game right now, obviously. The trading in the game doesn't work very well. You never see a blockbuster trade in the game and teams are constantly sending good players that are underperforming through the waivers. On my simulation Dion Phaneuf had a 50 point season but when I put him on the block, the best trade offer I can expect is a couple of 3rd or 4th round draft picks. This could be because of his salary, but I still think the game's trading mechanics need to be a little reworked.If you are looking for an extremely detailed GM simulator than Eastside Hockey Manager is the game to get. Don't let the ""Early Access"" deceive you, this is a game that is easy to waste hours on and is challenging and rewarding. Recommended to anyone that loves hockey and wants to know what goes on behind the scenes!			"

								I've been playing EHM for over 10 years starting with the original EHM before buying EHM 2005 and EHM 2007.  I've probably logged well over 2000 hours between database editing, participating in challenges over on EHM the Blue Line as well as enjoying it on my laptop as a welcome distraction on long flights.The game's core has not changed and believe me when I say that this truly is a good thing.  What has changed are numerous improvements including an interface that makes navigation easier, international tournaments are far more realistic and the game AI seems to have finally become more lifelike.If you're a hockey fan and you like sims, don't hesitate to invest in this.  Just remember to brush your teeth.			"

								It's kinda hard to put a rate on this game. First of all i want to thank SI for doing this, we really need a new Hockey Manager game. But when i started playing this Early Access it just feels like a new skin for EHM 2007. No big new featuers, and my expectations that many of the functions from Football Manager would be included in this game was wrong. And that makes me really worried. Because atm i feel that there is no need for me to stop playing a updated version of 2007 if there isnt any big difference between the games.I know that this is a early access game so many thing can happen along the way. But the lack of new functions makes me worried for the future. But i will still support this development. But i hope that you are doing it 100% SI and not only a fast rework of a old game.			"

								Under the hood, there have been some major changes to the game. It's still a work in progress, but it is already an improvement over EHM 2007. Once things have been tweaked further, I think it will be a big improvement over EHM 2007. It already makes a difference having customisable start dates (great for retro rosters) and having up-to-date rules and league structures. The player progression and attribute modelling has been overhauled - and the introduction of Player Roles will lead to better database updates, in my view.Visually the game has undergone a bit of a facelift. It's not a complete overhaul, but a nice improvement and will be familiar to anybody who has played the EHM 2007. This has made the UI more spacious but it would be nice to see support for wider/higher resolutions in the future.The game ships with a fictional database and no logos. However, this is easily solved by downloading community-created content - most of which is hosted on www.ehmtheblueline.com "

												This is one of those niche games that most gamers probably wouldn't like but a certain demographic will obsess on. If you're a NHL or hockey fan. If you've ever played fantasy hockey. If you obsess on your favorite team and what would make it better. If you ever wanted to blow up an eternal loser like my Canucks (:sadface:) and rebuild the way you'd want to see it. This game is for you.I've probably played this game more than all other games combined in my life. I've spent literally tens of thousands of hours on this game since it's inital release in 2004 and it honestly hasn't changed much since then. There's been some tweaks here and there in the game's 13+ year history but it's still essentially the same text based sports management sim now that it was then. As someone who loves sports sims and I've played most of then, NHL Eastside is the absolute best and deepest one I've ever played. You control every aspect of the playing side of the game. Transactions, waivers, minor teams, drafts, personnel, strategies, contracts, scouting and free agent signings. The most engrossing thing for me has always been developing young players and working them into your system. Under your guidance players like Connor McDavid, Patrik Laine, Auston Matthews and other prospects can either flourish or flounder in your system.I'm not sure if casual fans will enjoy it. But if you're a hardcore hockey, sports strategy/sports management games fan EHM is a peak experience. Even today 13 years later, I still get the urge and thrill of spending an evening obsessing on this game fairly often.  "

												Lots of free updates and improvements since release. I never played the original version but it appears that they have managed to resurrect an old game by making some great changes. Workshop integreation and a strong community makes this a steal at 9.99 if you like sports management games. Sure the interface isn't as slick as the other hockey sim game on the market, but it works and is intuitive.It's not as deep as Football Manager but it's pretty darn close. Highly recommended.			"

												The Good ;- The simulation engine is much better. Scores are more realistics and player statistics after a season are more like real life.- In the real NHL speed is pretty much around the same for all players except a select few who have incredible speed or are really slow. In game most players have speed ratings difference of ~10 except a couple of players (Hagelin, Kreider).- In game ratings are mostly well balanced and are very close to that of the real life player. (Note that ratings can be changed with a 3rd party freeware).- Drafting is very nice having good players in most drafts lets you get good prospects on a yearly basis.- Player development is good. Keep in mind that you need good coaching staff with the rating ""working with youngster"" high enough for the prospect to develop well.The Bad ; - Trading is awefull, Wanting to trade my Stamkos, i was offered a 2nd round pick and two 3rd round picks by all of the teams that had interest into him, Same goes when trying to trade for a player. EG : I needed a first line key winger and i had a surplus of Key 1-2 defender. I offered Subban for Kessel and they did not want to negotiate, so just out of curiosity i add four 1st round picks and they still would not want any part of it. Overall trading needs to be tweeked but you can get a steal every now and then when a team is desperate or overly incompetent.- Way to many injury blows or long term injury. At one point in my game, Galchenyuk, Subban, Price and Pacioretty had over 3 months injury. the longest was Price with 8 months. This to say, i was left with an AHL team in my hands.			"

												It was a long time waiting for a successor for EastSide Manager 2007. I had bought that game 4 times due to DRM issues. Luckily with Steam I shouldn't have to buy this more than once. In short it is every bit as good as 2007 and in some ways better. The AI seems far less likely to accept garbage deals such as dealing a large quantity of mediocre players for a 1st round draft pick which is great. There have been a few bugs but overall they have been fixed quickly in my eyes. Your players get suspended often and for longer amounts if they fight too much. I both like and dislike this. I used to employ psychos strictly to go after the other teams top players but this tactic is hamstrung by the suspensions. I don't really mind that much. Overall if you have enjoyed previous Eastside games in the past you owe it to yourself to check this out. One of the few games I can sink hours into on end and not notice the time fly by.			"

								I played EHM 2007 all the way until I bought my latest computer and had no way to transfer the license, so getting the news that there was an early access version of a new EHM made me so excited that I bought the game without even checking the supported platforms.I managed to get the game installed on Linux by running Steam with Wine, and took a quick test drive. At the moment, it seems that it is mostly just a facelifted version of EHM 2007 with new league structures and updated (if scrambled) data.I was expecting a bit more, to be honest (didn't have the time to check if they've fixed the salary cap mechanics or the entry-level deals to actually span three years even if you sign the prospect in the spring), but just having an EHM which works on my machine makes me extremely happy. I somehow managed to kick my Football Manager habit umpteen years ago, so this just might be my favourite video game franchise of all times.			"

												One of the best Management games on Steam. This game is an enjoyable experience for anyone who loves sports and likes management games. The 2D Graphics are smooth and easily followable, and the tactics are in-depth and provide a wide range of ways to play each game and develop your team. The game's tutorial is easily followable, but they could use some more added (especially the draft, that had me stumped a bit). The statistics portion allows in-depth analysis of all players in order to create your dream team and lead your team to victory.On the bad side, each game can somewhat take an overly long amount of time, even playing on fast and very fast speeds. The fast forward speed is what you will use for most games throughout the season. The difficulty is variable and on my first season I was able to win the Stanley Cup. I feel like they should make some new degrees of difficulty and they should allow us to change it (unless I'm missing something and just couldn't find the option)The game is surprisingly addicting and lovable, and the $20 price tag makes it completely worth it. Easily a better deal than the money-grabbing Football Manager made by the same developer as this game. So far EHM has not dissapointed me and I'm looking forward to more seasons.Overall I give this game a 9/10 as a lover of management games. If you're not into the Management series of games or if you're looking for a hockey game such as EA's NHL Series, this is NOT FOR YOU. If you do not like this style of game, you could be bored and you may not enjoy it at all. EDIT: I nominated this game for the Steam Awards and you should too!Thanks for Reading!-Joe ""Bonzaijoe""			"

												There is so much that I could go on about regarding this game, but I'll try to keep this as short and as sweet as possible. This game is as close to the ideal hockey management sim there has ever been, by a long shot, and that can probably be seen in my hours played lol. The amount of detail and customization available in this game is staggering, and the ability to pick any league/team is refreshing, as taking over junior teams is one of my favourite features. The drafting/scouting system is very well thought out, and even acts like real life, with players falling/rising and teams drafting based on positional needs rather than BPA. Free agency can be a little iffy at points, with many core/superstar players all available at once. The salary cap rises very slowly from year to year, which is another issue, but it's a fun challenge to go along with building a dynasty. Developing prospects requires patience and playing them in the right spots, and it really is rewarding to develop a superstar, or watch a 6th round pick grow into a key player. Trading is good as well, as there will be times where you get 'ripped off' and others where you come off with a steal - asset management is a big thing in this game. The only complaints I have, albeit minor, is that if you draft well, the game gets easy very quickly, as you just trade good players for picks, let them develop, and repeat. As well, if you don't know hockey that well, the game may be a bit tricky to begin with, but the tutorials help with that. Additionally, the custom roster/logo//facepacks that come along with the game are very well done. I would highly recommend this to any hockey fan/sports management fan - 10/10, 2 thumbs up!			"

								Changed my review to “not recommended” due to lack of action on actual fixes. Developer does not seem to be serious about fixing the game up; the game still runs in NHL 2007 rules and even then it doesn’t follow old NHL CBA rules. Developer is focused on fixing small generic Euro league problems; very little work has been put into the NHL or North American leagues.Unless the developer shows willingness to fix the game up, and to focus on NHL league, I can’t recommend the game.

												This game is fantastic. It's what EA NHL's Be A GM mode should be like. There's a slight learning curve, especially if you're new to hockey, but I recommend it to anyone who likes sports simulation games (e.g. Football Manager, OOTP Baseball). ehmtheblueline.com and /r/ehm are great resources for new players, with topics on tactics, practice, staff, and everything else. Definitely buy this game.			"

								I love this game. Best hockey manager game there is. There are still few things I hope to see. I would die for more playable leagues, even some smaller leagues like Australian league and Ukrainian league would be awesome to be playable. Also I would love to have more player conversation options and media things. Also there should be more options for financial stuff, like it would be nice to be able to change ticket prices and stuff.But those were just suggestions. I am still going to rate this game 8.5/10			"

												I have poured so much time into this game, and although it is still pretty bare-bones right now I can wholesomely recommend this game. If you've ever wanted to expand your hockey GM-work compared to EA Sports NHL, look no further. The learning curve is extremely steep, but once you learn the basics and even the advanced details you'll fall in love and want to keep playing more and more.			"

												if you play the GM mode in EA Sports NHL series and are disappointed year after year with the lack of depth and challenge, this could be what you're looking for.there are a couple of hurdles right off the hop that can turn off a new player, but if you get passed them, you should be on your way to a rewarding (and time devouring) experience.first hurdle is the lack of official licenses (except for, i think, EIHL & EPHL [U.K.]), but this is easily overcome with community made databases and picture/logo packs either from the steam workshop or from ehmtheblueline.  second hurdle is the menu navigation.  they have improved it somewhat from when the game was in early access, but given how deep the game can be, i think the menus are about as simple as they can make them.  all i can say for this is just stick with it, you'll figure out where everything is eventually.the challenges and depth EHM offers over EAs NHL GM modes is, in my opinion, like night and day.  admittedly, i haven't touched EAs NHL series since NHL14, but i'm guessing the GM modes haven't really been touched since then.  the biggest differences i can name off the top of my head are:the closest you can get to the ice is coaching, you cannot jump onto the ice during the third period and single handedly overcome a 4 goal deficit.  that doesn't mean that your team can't do it, you just can't do it for them.  this definitely ups the challenge since you can't cheese your way to the playoffs or a cup with a no chemistry bottom feeder team.there are no solid concrete ""overall"" or ""potential"" ratings.  there are skill ratings and statistics for you to scour over and determine how they're developing and if/where they will fit into your roster.  you also have scouts, trainers, coaches, and assistant GM that will give you a fair idea of how good a player is or their potential, but like real world, they can sometimes be very wrong.  i've had players that all my staff said were going to be a first line talent or starting goalie go completely bust, and i've had players that staff said had 4th line or no potential turn out consistent 50+ point seasons.i also find trading and free agency to be far more difficult.  there are no interest meters for free agents and they may sign with another team for more than they requested when you offered.  sometimes your UFAs want to test out free agency, or just don't want to play for you anymore.  sometimes your foreign prospects wont be willing to leave their countries or teams.  you're also unlikely to be the clear cut immediate winner in a trade, especially if you're the one proposing it and the player you're offering for isn't on the trading block.  trading up 1:1 for a slightly better player is rare and you're not going to get to Crosby, Kane, Stamkos, Karlsson, Price, etc. this way.anyway, i think that covers most of the important stuff and i'm getting sick of typing.  if you want something deeper than EAs NHL GM modes and are willing/determined enough to get passed the initial hurdles, there's a potentially very addicting game that awaits... just look at my play time.

								Very detailed simulation that you can lose hours in. You control the amount of control you have over your team, so you can do basic GM duties all the way up to controlling all scouting and strategy for each game. The great thing is you can multi-task while playing which makes it possible to watch hockey and play hockey all at the same time! This is early access so I expect the UI to get smoother and easier to use, it's not bad but at times it feels clunky and not very easy to figure out.			"

								It takes a certain type to get their kicks out of this. If you're a guy who plays EA's latest in Be a GM Mode and then simulates the games, this might be for you. There are still a few hiccups through early access and the community is largely responsible for providing licensed content, but this is very much the top hockey simulator out there, and it *will* eat up way more of your time than you want it to.

												Football Manager, but hockey. Mod support which includes facepacks and updated rosters are available as well.Perfect for running in the background or on a second monitor when you're doing other things. Could take a while to get used to if you're unfamiliar with the genre / sport. I recommend diving in and messing around for a bit until you're comfortable, then starting over again when you know what to do. Little things like setting up your scouts for the upcoming draft (assuming you're controlling an NHL team), inviting all your prospects to training camp even if they won't make the team, setting up training for your players. Once you get a feel for the game, it's engrossing.			"

Early Access Review
								DISCLAIMER: I want to start out by noting a couple of things that may be relevant to people interesed in this game. First, I never played Football Manager in any form, nor did I play this game's old 2007 iteration. I had no biases coming into this game. Second, while I am a hockey fan (Go Bolts!) I was not a hardcore fan. I was (and largely am) still fairly casual in that I don't follow mundane stats, am not up to date on every player in the league and don't watch every single game. That being said. This game is fantastic! I am having loads of fun with this gaming experience and as far as I can tell will be having lots of fun for months if not years to come. Who would like this game? - anyone who enjoys management games- anyone who enjoys stats and tactical games- any sports fans (hockey is a plus!) PROS:- addictive gameplay that makes you feel involved and responsible for your teams success and failure- a ""one more turn"" type of pull (days are done in turns)- a unique and highly realistic game simulator that you can watch in real time or sped up (highly entertaining)- HEAPS of potential, this game is still in Early Access but it is very fun and playable in it's current state, updates will only launch it to new heights- in depth stats and tactics including fully realized and modeled shot analysis for games (impressive)CONS:- confusing and unoptimized UI (needs streamlining)- can't control players yourself (this should go without saying but some people don't come to grips with this concept until they're in game)- lack of useful tutorial and helpful tooltips (had to bumble around some things before finding them out myself)- no sounds except crowd noise (might benefit from certain ambient sounds a calm musical track)All in all this game as it stands is great and will only continue to get better over time. It's a low price, can be played in short bursts or long stretches, has an addictive one more turn type of gameplay that makes you feel involved and connected to your team. I love it. 8.5/10			"

								I've been playing this series since FHM 2005, although it was FHM 2007 that I put in hundreds of hours.  This version of the game is an iterative improvement over FHM 2007.  It appears to be a conservative migration to SI's latest app engine, but maintains a very similar flow to EHM 2007, not the latest Football Manager game.With that said, this game is simply spectacular.  I've only played a few games into my season with this version (so I'm not an authority on the state of completeness) but what I've seen so far is fantastic.  I've had some gripes with FHM 2007, fortunately it appears that quite a few of them have been addressed.  The fact that SI is bringing this game back is astonishing considering how they unceremoniously dropped the game after pirating concerns shortly after it was released in 2006.  Those of us with the Mac version really got screwed since there were some terrible bugs that were never fixed.Regardless, I'm really excited for the future... If this game gets half the attention FM gets, we're in for a treat.  I have a feeling what we are playing now is a wait-and-see product- see what the respose is to this conservative effort and decide if it's worth investing any additional effort.  Judging from the response so far it should be a resounding YES, this game deserves 1st class attention!Anyway, newcomers from FM are going to need to be patient, the UI is no where near as mature as FM.  FM has had the benefit of many years of iterrative development... while EHM has been in stasis for 8 years.  Even if this release just brings EHM up to date and nothing more, we all win.  Hopefully next years release will start incorporating some of FM's ground breaking systems.  This game is worth every penny whether you are new to the series or upgrading from EHM 2007.  My favorite sports sim ever, hands down. "

												If I had to compare this to any game, it'd be Football Manager 2007. EHM has always had a very similar layout and skin to the early FMs due to Sports Interactive's involvement, so anyone used to that kind of skin and general aesthetic feel to the game will feel right at home immediately.EHM provides just enough depth for your hardcore players to immerse themselves in but is also very simple to pick up and play. The game has a hardcore community of fans and players who've played the game since its very first release and who also provide extra content and small modifications. A quick Google search will take you to a couple of forums I'm referring to.Back in my time at uni, I found myself addicted to FM12 due to its healthy all-round balance of fun gameplay and vast database. EHM is no different, and at the ripe old age of 24 I regularly find myself slipping into comatose states at 3am instead of sleeping and performing appropriately at work later that very day. Even as I write this review, I am at work. The game is brilliant.Unlike many management games, this has a 'pick up and play' quality to it and provides the option to manage a team 3 or 4 levels below the Elite League in the UK. Where tactics are concerned, you're able to give full instructions to your entire team, all lines and even individual players if you see fit, to a very specific level. If that doesn't emphasise depth, I'm not sure what does. The game is an absolute steal at £14.99 as well! Genuinely can't stop playing it.			"

Early Access Review
								The best version yet of what is easily my favorite sports game of all time. I played dozens of seasons of the original freeware EHM back in the day and bought all the SI releases as well. If you like hockey or sports management sims in general, chances are you'll have a blast with it. I don't generally write reviews, but I saw somebody complaining in the comments of the latest update (15.9.0b) that this game was an Early Access ""half-product"" and that the developers had lied about their intentions. There are plenty of those kinds of games around, but EHM isn't one of them. I would've paid the asking price just to get EHM 2007 running with community mods on my modern PC system. Instead I get new features and updates with detailed logs of the changes every two weeks. If that's not good enough for you at a $15 price point - which, it should be noted, is lower than what people will pay for the game after its Early Access period is over - it might be time to reconsider the choices that have led you to this point in your life.

The game provides hundreds of hours worth of enjoyment - the addictedness rating for it is through the roof and sometimes you get so wrapped up that you forget there's a world outside. With expansions via teh Steam Workshop this game is by far the best installment of EHM to date and I look forward to further updates and advancements from its dedicated developers and supporters.

												Best hockey on pc since days of NHL 04 and EHM 07. Seeing how EA talks all the time about franchise return on PC being a possibility but never actually delivering on these words and 2K which seems to be focusing more on mobile hockey it's probably going to stay that way for some time.Changes from EHM 07 aren't exactly enormous but with workshop support modding is easier than ever and it does get some changes like (in my opinion) prettier UI and bunch of bugfixes. If you are a fan of the sport and don't mind in-depth management buying this is a no brainer.			"

												I rarely watch hockey unless it's the playoffs. I don't play as my city franchise, and yet this game is oddly captivating for someone who never excelled at math or considered themself a stats junkie. If you can't figure out how to add real world players or franchises to this game via third parties then I don't think this game should bear the brunt of your negative review. The developers clearly put a lot of effort into this game and if you have half an imagination allows for the fleshing out of some pretty cool narratives. I can leave this game open in windowed mode and do other things like watch TV shows. The game demands as much attention as you want to give it at any given point in time. The game has some flaws and minor glitches but only one of which I found particularily annoying and hope the devs have been made aware of: if you're in the playoffs and you check a player's bio it sometimes has a spoiler about the end of the series (which is weird that it's pre-determined) in the form of ""will be disappointed their team couldn't win the Stanley Cup this year"" while the series is still in progress and by all appearances still TBD. Everytime I've seen this message it plays out like clock work - that team loses in the playoff series.I don't think this game is for everyone and the learning curve was pretty steep for myself. It's a pretty addictive and fun game overall, I played the last incarnation of EHM and this one is improved in many ways.			"

												It's an interesting game for certain.I'm a PC gamer at heart and so the only hockey games I've played in the last 6-7 years have been nhl 07 and 09 on pc . I enjoyed the gm mode in those games even though it was rather easy to play. I bought this game on steam when it was on sale thinking that it could be interesting. I find that it is an interesting and challenging game to play as especially when you are someone that has never played the game. I started as toronto in the single player model to get a feel for the game. So of course I attempted to do a complete rebuild within the first week, getting all types of high end draft picks and good prospects while keeping the few young guys and veteran players around that were worth keeping. I also went too crazy in scouting and signing young free agent players. So i rather quickly found myself in a situation where I had 65 players signed to contracts and as a result I had to start trying to move them elsewhere. I got it down to about 55 or so before I decided to start again from the beginning as toronto. The scouting and free agency system in place feel much more realistic and you have to be very careful about who you sign, who you offer tryouts to, what type of deals you make with other teams because you can easily get your team into trouble in the short, medium or long terms if you make a bad signing or elevate your risk of being fired if you make a bad deal (so far I found it's rather hard to make a ""good"" deal if you know you have to get rid a player for contract reasons or cap reasons). Teams are also very reluctant to give up high draft picks or prospects which makes the game very challenging and enjoyable in seeing how far you can push other teams in deals.If there is one thing one little problem I noticed it is that it's hard to get fired in the game. My toronto team started the season off well ending up in 4th in the conference at about the quarter of a season mark. Then they lost about 15 games straight with 3 of those games being in OT/Shootout. They are 14th in the conference right now. No mention from the board about what are you doing to end this losing problem, no companing from the fans, etc. Not exactly realistic.			"

								Absolutley a great game... I have been waiting for so long to play it again. Lets hope it will be as FM series soon. I can only recommend this game if u liked FM. It has that old school charm FM lost last couple of years. EDIT:After playing for three seasons with Oilers I can rate the game as 7,5/10. The main reason is depth. Game lacks depth atm. I was only concentrated on matches and stats. Not much to do besides that.			"

								9.5/10, almost the perfect simulatorI have to say, this is the best hockey simulator out there, by far. This goes way more in-depth than any other hockey GM simulator I have ever played and it is by far the most realistic of any hockey simulators I have played. The strategies mean a lot in this. In my first year of Tampa, Ben Bishop was terrible: 3.43 GAA and a .878 save percentage. I made lots of strategy changes that made more players defensively-minded and it raised Bishop's stats to a 2.75 GAA and a .902 save percentage. In EA's be a GM mode, the strategies mean nothing. You can't decide how a player plays, you can't coach the players, you only assign what lines the players are on and that is it. In EHM, you decide where the player plays, the length of his shifts, his shoot/pass ratio, his practice, almost everything. Overall, it is incredibly addictive. I only have two games on Steam: TF2 and Eastside Hockey Manager. I have played more TF2 than Eastside Hockey Manager, but Eastside Hockey Manager has almost completely gotten me away from NHL 15's GM mode. When you compare the two, EHM is by miles better, and it's still in beta. Bravo to the developers for making such an amazing game.Wishlist/Gripes:*The ability to edit players. No matter what simulator I play, there will always be tweeks needed to the rosters. For example, Cam Talbot has worse stats than Robin Lehner in this game which I highly disagree with. In NHL 15 on current gen, you are able to edit players and make the sim even more realistic. I would like to see a player editing option because I still find that there are players who are rated too high or too low.*More casual options. I think options like injuries, waivers, and an assistant coach rotate goalies option would all be welcome in my opinion. I feel that waivers make it a little too easy and they need some fixes. I have seen the following players in years one, two, or three get placed on waivers:*Marian Hossa*Jiri Sekac*Brandon Saad*Dustin BrownIf options like this are available then I'm stupid, just saying.*More simple simulation. I find it frustrating that when I go on a vacation the assistant GM completely takes over. I think there is an option that can turn him off, but it is still very annoying when I'm a cap team and my assistant GM brings in Marian Gaborik. And the coach will also make lineup changes when there is no injury which is annoying. I wish the simulation way more like EA's but at least it isn't a major problem.*About the injuries, sometimes it feels like the injuries do get way out of hand. I always see like one or two or tears a month and those are four month injuries. I remember on my Edmonton play through in year two I had an injury every other game it felt like. All were minor (thank god), but it got to be very annoying. I think injuries can stay because they add a lot of challenge (like when I lost Jason Demers to a damaged spine which is essentially a year-long injury), but turning down the frequency of the injuries would be welcome.

								Love it!Being a hockey fan and saw it as an Early Access I bought it after being on the storepage forabout 10 secs. I didn't know what to expect but hit the ""Buy it button"" straight away, although havingmy doubts. I didn't expect ANYTHING from this game at all.I was hooked the minute I hit the start career. I've been hooked since. So much that I haven'tbought a game since. (Sorry Steam) I even got so hooked, that I've made a few mods for it aswell.It's deep, intense and so exciting that I've fallen i love with the game as I've never been before with any game before. Despite the 2D. At least not for such a long periode of time. Normally a game doesn't keep me interested for more than a 100 or 200 hours. this one I've been playing close to 1000 hours by now, which for me is totally unheard of. I don't even get it myself. I must be mad.I was so surprised that the graphics didn't matter a bit for me. Normally my love for beautiful graphics are a must, but in this game I couldn't care less. If you're a hockey fan, this is absolutely a must buy.It's been a big part of my life ever since I bought it, and can honestly say that it's the best money I've ever payed for a game entertainmentwise.I've never wrote a review before in my life, but this one deserves it.It's very well polished and functional already, and the games are intense as you have so many different settings during games to turn an obvious loss into a win, if done the right way.I can't praise it enough. as said I've played 1000 hours, although mostly offline, and at leastspend another 500 hours fiddling around with it, installing different mods and packs to make iteven better. Even made small mods for it, which I never did before either for any games.Of course I'm a hockey fan which certainly help my interest in the game, but still.I can only say BUY it, SUPPORT it as it's by far the best hockeygame on the market, and wedefinitely need a hockey game on the market.I would LOVE to see this develop further, and therefore cannot emphasize other hockey fans enoughto support it.Believe me when I say that I would NEVER play that many hours of ANY game if it wasn'tfully functional and enjoyable...Why would I, with all the games out there, hockey fan or not.I love football too, but have never even come close to the same amount of playing time as I have with this game.It's deep and I just love it. People that doesn't buy this game should be put in jail for being ignorant...:-)I Simply Just Love it and it's worth every Pounds, Kroner, Euro, Dollar or whatever currency you might be having in your bank account.I've said my bit. Just BUY it!! It's worth it!!			"

								This is my first time playing any PC sports managing game (However, I've been playing NHL GM Modes for the the last 5 years), and all I've got to say is that it is fantastic!It's incredibly easy to lose your time playing this game, and it's a game that, once you stop, you want to pick back up ASAP. Although it is not officially licensed by the NHL, downloading all the updated rosters and facepacks takes little more than 5 minutes, and is well worth the download. It makes the game much more enjoyable as you get to have players on your team that actually exist in the NHL.Being able to decide what your entire staff will consist of, from scouts to coaches to freaking physio guys makes the game incredibly indepth. The addition of being able to adjust specific coaching styles to specific players, as well as being able to adjust how each and every line performs night after night is incredibly indepth and rewarding as you lead your team towards stanley cup glory! (or whatever other trophy the team you chose is qualified to win, because you can basically manage every professional hockey team on the planet.)This is essentially a much more indepth, almost overwhelming version of EA's NHL GM Modes. Once you get past the learning curve, you'll see no reason to give EA $70 every year for essentially an updated roster pack. While EA's NHL games are losing features, this game is gaining more and more features every 2 weeks or so. Give your money to this team instead of EA, because they're converting your $17 into a much better game at a much lower cost than any of the recent NHL games. This game will likely cost you all of your free time, and may even dip into your... non-free time. 10/10			"

								First, this is an early access game so it is not a finished product.  It needs time and they have already made changes to the product to attempt to improve it.  I expect this to continue based on the history this team has.Second, Some have posted that ""it doesn't have the features of Football Manager"" but that is a ridiculous expectation for a game that is a third of the cost of Football Manager and has not had the number of releases as that game.Now that I got the disclaimers out of the way.  I recommend this product to any hockey fan that has always wanted to run a team.  It has some growing pains but it shows a lot of promise.The positives:+ It's a hockey sim, a market that is in dire need of a good product.+ The stats are believable.  Scoring and penalties may be slightly inflated but I grew up watching hockey in teh 80's so I have no issue with the increase in scoring.  A 4-3 game is more entertaining than a 2-1 game.  :-)+ The 2D view allows you to watch the action, or just highlighted versions of the action.  It still needs work but it has a bit of a feel like the old Gretzky Hockey days.+ Did I say it's a hockey sim?!?!?!?The negatives:- Issues with CPU GM's (players getting put on the trading block but when you inquire you get a message that says the player is untouchable; teams with cap room waiving star players, not overly common but it does seem to happen and in the major case that I saw it was said player from the trading block being waived the next day after my inquiry and said player was the scoring leader at the time)- 2D match engine could use some work, there are some times where the penalty being called doesn't seem to fit the situation or the play being made by the player with the puck doesn't make a lot of sense or for that matter the play made by the defender- The UI could use some work, takes a bit of poking around to find things			"

								It gets very repetative after a while. The games are very similar to each other. It's fun to set up the tactics and choose players for the different lineups, but there are only so much you can do each game. My main problem is the format; if you have a big screen it will only be possible to play in a small window. I hope they fix this, but I think it's because they've used the old code from ten years ago, so it will not scale. Overall it's an interesting game for new players, but if you have played the old one there is very little that is new.			"

												I'm going to have to give it a big thumbs down.  Not much here to justify playing this over Eastside Hockey Manager 2007.  I would love to give it a thumbs up, but now I'm just disappointed I paid for this in Early Access.  Shame on me for thinking I was supporting development when the only thing we supported was making SI easy money.  Thanks, SI.  You will be the last publisher who fools me with Early Access.One simple mechanic that bugs the crap out of me in both versions:  just because a kid is Canadian, that doesn't mean he only aims to play major junior.  Just because a kid is American, that doesn't mean he only aims to play college hockey.  This big logic hole ruins both games for me.  Junior A/NCAA aspects of this series continues to be an after thought.  Would have loved to take control of a team in the USHL or any of the other Junior A team.  The only junior alternative this game (and Electonic Art's games) gives is Canadian major junior.  Meh.			"

												as a huge hockey and management sim fan i bought this game on release. especially since im also a longtime fan  of FM and SI.so that being said i had high hopes of EHM. Sadly this game does not (yet) deliver the quality one has come to expect from SI.The game itself has huge potential. but it feels rushed in a whole.Currently i have 2 MAIN ISSUES with this game.1) The screen resolution does not support 16:9  only 4:3 for a modern game this is uncceptable as widescreens are the norm. nowadays.2) very very prone to crashes during the matches.  I had to atleast replay each match twice due to crashes of the game. for a game that draws heavily on the FM engine (or so it looks like) this is very unexpected as one should think the engine has already proven his worth in the FM sries.so currently while this game has huge potential i can not recommend it at this time.

												This is half a sim. The important aspect is there but the superficial one is not.It is missing the real world stuff.This sim's price should be no higher than 8-10$ since there are no real world team logos, no real world players, just a big nothing from reality. I mean I have Franchise Hockey Manager and it has everything for about the same price. Why are the EHM so greedy?So to fix that we need to make everything ourselves, thus the stuff in the workshop. The designers of EHM probably depended on this and they said to themselves "" there's probably some fan who will make these add-ons, so why bother with licences of each leagues when they will do it for us for free!""Albeit this downside, the sim runs nicely and is quite challenging, especially if you play from the bottom of the ladder in a country where hockey is not popular to the NHL.Don't buy unless it is 10$ or less or you'll be disappointed to see that for 20$+ you don't get any real world players or teams.

								Although early access, EHM:EA is a very polished management simulation. If you enjoy hockey, or any sports gm games, you owe it yourself to pick this game up. From Version 15.0.1b (first early access version) here are some of my findings on the game:Pro's: - Has nearly all the features from the EHM 2007, meaning it already is the deepest hockey sim available.- Nice new touches like players bio information talking about players close friends on the team.- Nice tactical improvements like individual strategies for players-Tactical improvements for lines including choosing who would be the playmaker on the line.- Free Agency is much more realistic. Don't expect to always build your teams on July 1st, UFA's want money and term just ilke in real life.-Position's of players are more in-depth, including their roles like defensive defenseman, stay-at-home defensemen, 2-way forward, skilled forward, quick forward. This adds to the fun of building cohesive forward units.-Tons of international tournaments, take control of your favorite national team and try to build a team to bring glory to your country.-The in game match view has been improved and is very enjoyable watching your team battle it out.Con's:- Interface and menus are very similar to EHM 2007 so it is missing some more modern interface options.- Resolution needs to be improved for modern pc's- Scoring has to be balanced a bit more to 2015 scoring levels (its a bit too high at least in NHL games).- Missing leagues like the Swiss leagues, Russian MHL, and British Hockey leagues from 2007 version.- Coaches and GMs get fired a little more than in the real world.There are a few issues like the small window the game runs in and the interface definitely needs some modern touches, but the rest of the cons are minor. The positives far outweigh the negatives with this release. Please do yourself a favor and buy this game if you enjoy the sport of hockey and have ever wanted to build your dream team or test your management skill in the lower leagues and build a legendary story as you climb the ranks to finally leading your national team to world glory.

I have no clue how to fix this problem, as I've tried changing every possible setting already. This is a huge issue that needs to be fixed, as it had worked perfectly up until December 1st.I've had this game for a little under a week, and I've already played for over 30 hours... I'll let that speak for itself. I love all of the little things that you can do in this, and I recently played NHL 15 GM mode, and finally realized what it has been lacking. This game deserves an 11/10. I would pay $50 if I had to for this game. $15 is just a steal. To any other hockey fanatics out there... BUY THIS GAME!!!!!			"

												NOTE: If you use Webroot as your security system running this game will lead to HUGE database files in the WRData folder (under program data) due to Webroot monitoring its processes regardless of whether you've told it to monitor the program or not. Even when it is set to not monitor EHM it still will. I've been in contact with Webroot customer support several times and they have yet to permanently resolve the issue.EDIT: Recently making webroot allow the process instead of monitor EHM.exe seems to stop it from making huge files, still unsure whether this is short term or long term fix however.I love this game especially with TBH roster packs.

												Great hockey GM game! I have played many hockey based games from AAA to brower games and this games management depth is outstanding. If you want a indepth pure GM mode this game is for you, allowing you to control everything from drafts to contract clauses. Only flaw I can leverage about this game is of course the lack of league and player licensing but that can be overcome with a simple install of fan made update files. Was also impressed the being able to branch out and not be forced to manage a NHL team but instead play a lower tier  Finnish league team if I so desired. EHM doesn't deserve to be called Early Access since it is jam packed and destroys anything EA Sports GM mode will be putting out anytime soon. Looking forward to many more hours with this game!

								Don't be scared off by the ""Early Access"".   Iknow the tag has been abused by many devs in recent memory, but this is not really a new franchise.EHM is a game series that has been around since 2004 with EHM: Franchise Edition, and in spirit since 2001 when the original freeware EHM was released.  After EHM:FE, SI Games released EHM 2005 and then EHM 2007.  The fan community has kept 2007 alive and updated since then.  So this is not a brand-new, from scratch game.  This is a game built on an already successful core from EHM 2007.  Riz and the SI guys are not new at this, and SI is the company behind the super-popular, long-running Football Manager series.  EHM:EA marks essentially the 4th release in the EHM series after a hiatus of many years,There is not a more-detailed, in-depth hockey management simulation game available on the market, period.  As with any sports management sim there is a learning curve.  But once you get it, you'll be willingly sinking a whole lot of time into it.			"

An absolute no-brainer to pick up for fans of Football Manager who want a change in pace, or hockey fans who are sick of the lack of depth in EA NHL's GM Mode.Make sure to download rosters and graphics packs for the full experience!

Liiga has been updated to new rules etc etc and this game has KHL. THIS IS A GREAT GAME ALREADY!!Tässä pelissä on kaikki ominaisuudet mitä puuttui edellisestä pelistä, ja tämä on vasta early access!! Liiga päivitetty esim. ulkomaalaispelaajia saa palkata kuinka haluaa ja tässä on esim. KHL. NYT JO AIVAN MAHTAVA PELI!!			"

If I have any crisism its that it is a little slow taking off and a little overwhelming to a  newb of this series. But if you push through the magic really comes out in the hockey games. It's like watching a hockey game with an above view, you control basic tactics and the slightest change can make the biggest difference. Going to keep playing this, but if you love hockey and the idea of managing a team get this game. You will have to be patient with it until you get to know it.			"

												When did it leave Early Access? Seriously, I want to know. The game is just as unpolished and ugly as it was in Early Access mode. Sure, I get it, EAHM doesn't have the same sized market as FM, but seriously; everything about this game is seven years behind. The interface is ugly and outdated, the game simulations are only 2d overhead (3d tv broadcast angle would be so great), players keep dumping the puck from their own zone resulting in a lot of icing calls and players struggle to accept passes at the point making a little figure skating pirouette; a play that most of the time ends up offside. Even when the man on the point is wide open and the pass is tape2tape. The game/sim speeds has very little variation: It's very slow, slow, somehow slower and speedoflight. It's difficult and time consuming navigating through all the in-game-menus (and at times its unresponsive as you have to left-click the choices half a dozen times before the page changes) and the need to confirm changes every time you look at your tactics, shortlist, free agency etc ,even if changes weren't made, is simply annoying. The lack of an established community where you can share succesful tactics you've created, custom designed jerseys  or AAR is a major let down. I mean, there is a community but it's SO empty. The boards are pretty much ghost towns. Even real players playing this game, the way proffesional soccer players play FM, would make the experience somewhat better. If you play FM you will know exactly what I mean. Entry-level contracts are also broken in the NHL but that might just be a bug in the rosters I downloaded.My teams seem to always have trouble keeping pucks out of the net but I'll give EAHM the benefit of a doubt on this one and assume that A)my goalies are just that bad B)my tactics are just that bad C)A&B. I'm leaning towards A because I have experimented a lot and my skaters are stacked while my goalies are usually mediocre. So would I reccomend this game?  I have in the past touted just how excited I was to own this game ""The game is addicting although it's very raw but only because it's in early access"".  Is what I would say, telling people to be patient. But know I don't feel the same way. I actually feel cheated and betrayed. Everything that I hoped and expected would be updated wasn't. If you're not hockey mad then stay away. If you enjoy this concept then play FM. sure it's made and published by the same companies but it's so much better.Still going to play the game until I puke at the sight of an NHL logo			"

												Got this game to try to satisfy my need for an NHL type game on PC. However, it didn't really fulfill what I wanted. Besides that, I think that time in between games takes too long and I didn't see an option to skip to the next game day. I had a great team, no one looked better, so there was no need to go through each separate day. The game doesn't come with the best explanations and took a little bit to get use to also. Personally, I think this game is a little slow for my own liking. If you have more patience, this game might be for you.It's not that I'm completely opposed to this game, I just know that it's not for me. I'm more impartial, but Steam doesn't have a button for that.			"

												When my friend bought the weekly humblebundle and got Eastsiiiiiiiiide Hockey Manager, I was ecstatic.  It's not every day some yankee ♥♥♥♥ from Seattle takes interest in the best game in the world.   So we fired it up, and after 2 hours of figuring out the right port to connect to each other's network, we finally got in.  We spent another 2 hours trying to set up a league without it crashing.  Want to load a save?  Crash.  Want to save a save? Crash.  Want to name your team?  That's a crash bud.  Did you just try to sign a coach?  CRAAAAAASH.   We spent a combined 5 hours trying to get the game to work, and this isn't at all because SEGA made it.  A company whose last grasp of glory was a blue ball trying to jump through holes.  Kinda like I do when I need to relieve stress looking at pornographic material after playing this abomination.  The previous version of this game was dated at 2007, and they failed to test simple crashes in those assumed 10 years of development.   Did a monkey test it?  Did a monkey design it?  I mean, my CPU usage shot straight to 100 percent as soon as I click ""Drop the puck"".  Highly optimized.  The immersion value is terrible in this game. with several players having the same last name.   That never happens in real life.  On top of that, my friend figured out some kind of cheat where I would lose every time I faced him.  Go figure. SEEEEEEEGAAAAAAAA!			"

Those poor saps won't have any idea how fun it is to TANK FOR MCDAVIDDDDDSI seems to be going for a natural progression from the last version (2007) to what might have been a 2008 game.  So it'll certainly feel like a huge step back for Football Manager fans.  For hardcore hockey nuts like me, this is an impulse buy, no questions asked.  IF YOU ARE HOCKEY NUT YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A CHOICE YOU WILL BUY THIS GAME.  If you are a fan of sports sims this is basically the only hockey manager out there (others don't even come close).  Much potential.But yeah.  Traded AHL plugs and old farts for draft picks.  Maybe needs to be fixed, but the road to Lord Stanley has already begun.			"

								This game is exactly what I had dreamed of from ever since I found EHM2007 to be too much of a hassle, while an excellent game and countless of hours sunk in to it, but certain things would bug me. Scoring was too high, UI was clunky, start dates were hard coded and so on.Now almost all of these major problems are fixed. The game needs work, trade AI is somewhat better but could use work. Make sure to head over to http://ehmtheblueline.com/ for the real rosters, logos and so on.One more thing, I cannot wait for online leagues! That is for sure going to be a blast. Trust me tinkering out trades and  figuring out who to draft with other players is a wet dream for anyone that likes fantasy hockey or just if youre enthuastic hockey follower anyways!SUPPORT THIS GAME AND BUY IT SO THAT WE CAN SHOW THAT WE DESERVE A HOCKEY MANAGER SIMULATION FROM THE BEST DEVELOPER OUT THERE!!!

								All previous versions, this is very good and addictive (time consuming!!)I do have 1 issue so far; it's way too hard to trade!The number of players on each team that are considered as being 'franchise players' or 'future franchise players' and, therefore, pretty much untradable is quite ridiculous.Teams also have issue with taking more salary than what they ship out (I had trades rejected because the A.I. didn't like the 'financial aspect' of the trade, even though the $$ difference was less that 100,000$.All this make trades hard to do and is taking a bit of the fun away from the game... I mean, what's the use of managing a team if you're stuck with the same old roster from start to finish of a season?Even trying to trade top 6 players along with picks and / or prospects for other top 6 players is a hard sell as teams don't want to let go of said players... (Trading Alex Galchenyuk along with 5 first round picks can't get me McDavid or Nugent-Hopkins or Draisatl or even Yakupov for god's sake... I then switched Galchenyuk for Subban as Oilers needs a top 2 defenseman... So, Subban and 5 first round picks and I'm only asking for Nugent-Hopkins... I'm getting as an answer: ""This offer is seriously unbalanced, we're not prepared to talk""... This makes no freaking sense!!!)I hope the final version allows for more flexibility as far as trades goes. I don't want it to go back to the point where I was able to trade Gionta, a 2nd round and half the club in Hamilton to get Crosby as this made no sense whatsoever (in previous versions) but, man, there has to be some kind of middle ground where we're able to make fair trades and enjoy the game even more.

												This is just a reskinned version of EHM2007. Slightly shinnier, but rarely works. Half the time I try to launch the game, I either get a graphics error, or nothing works at all.Fix the major graphical glitches, clean up the UI and get back to what made EHM so great.			"

								This review is based on Early Access. Should my opinion on the game change through the game's development, I'll alter the review.I wanted to like EHM. I never played 2007, but I've heard it was a great sim so I immediately bought into the early access. The key aspects of the game that keep me from recommending it are the poor menu system, the lack of in game tool tips, and the unsatisfactory resolution.The game has a lot of potential to be something great. I tried putting a significant amount of hours into it and for all the things the game does right, the above mentioned shortcomings kept me from investing the amount of hours I've put in to other sims like Out of the Park Baseball.

												Greatly enjoyed 2007 Eastside Hockey Manager, but the newversions are a little dissapointing. A few reasons:No longer Mac compliant - Just being lazy.No editorStronger graphics, but more complicated/reduced GM mode and game play.Many will dissagree, but the older versions were much better.At least these developers are trying to pick up the pieces.I'm sure that they will adapt and improve the game. Still rooting for you guys!Just for fun: Between periods - introduce ""Pin the Tail on the Bettman"".Finding the approiate mascot should be easy.			"

												I wrote a review when the game was first released in Early Access, however so much has changed since that time, that a new review is needed and a new rating.EHM, and it's team have made a great game albeit somewhat of an empty canvas for which you can paint upon.. By that I mean the game and the stability, features, engine etc are all well done. But the lack of NHL Licensing causes you to have fake teams and players, this is where the empty canvas becomes painted upon by ""The Blue Line community"" http://www.ehmtheblueline.com These guys have made rosters, facepacks, logo packs and essentially give you the player the final pieces to have a great game from KHL to CHL Junior Hockey to the NHL... all the leagues and rosters are well done and really are as good a roster as any developer could do. To Summarize, it's become a good enough and improved enough game to be worth buying regardless if you own EHM 07 or not.. and The Blue Line rosters and Logos, Facepacks are a must to give you a great managing experience for whatever league you wish to take part in.

												Game crashed my computer in less than 20min.  And I'm not talking about your standard CTD, this thing fried my operating system requiring a hard power reboot to recover from.  Afterward I removed the game from my system and placed in my steam “Dislike” category.  Just Keep in mind that the following review is after only less than ½ hour of play.  Another thing worthy of note, I've never actually played a game like this before. Wile I'm really not a big sports game fan, I do like statistics and derive a great deal of enjoyment from management sims.According to this games wiki page, it started as freeware, got picked up by SEGA once it got popular and (much the way of the Frankenstein monster) has exploded out of proportion from there.  Lets start with the good.1. The Content is Extensive and Comprehensive, and covers data from wide variety of dates, and players from a staggering number of places.2. Includes Steam Workshop Support.  Thou the content in the workshop is limited, the fact that it is moddable at all is a good sign.3. The Game derives statistics from a staggering number of categories.  Training schedules, play tactics, talent scouts, fan loyalty, and dozens of other things all factor into the gameplay.4. Its one of the only sports titles that isn’t made by EA, to me that's a big selling point.And now the bad.1. If your like me, and your looking at a good management simulation but know very little about hockey, PASS THIS GAME UP.  The games design assumes anyone that plays this is a hard core hockey fan. If you don't know the game intimately, or play it yourself, none of the information in this game is going to make seance.2. The game has one of the most dreadful tutorials I have ever seen.  Seriously SEGA, if your reading this, PLEASE watch the extra credits episode “Tutorials 101” Here 


YouTube™ Video: Tutorials 101 - How to Design a Good Game Tutorial - Extra Credits 

			Views: 301,492		

			The first five minutes can make or break a game. Tutorials can be a crucial part of the game experience, but too often they become obtrusive for experienced players or overwhelming for new players.		

 Seriously, your a professional game company, you should know better than this.3. The UI is extremely awkward.  I can see how they wanted to model it after a web browser but its so clunky that combined with the awful tutorial, the experience is unapproachable and unfulfilling.4. I would like to address any bugs the game has, however since I couldn’t figure out what was going on, the game could have hundreds of bugs or none and I in all fairness wouldn’t know.All in all, a great idea.  Just not very playable			"

								I supported this title expecting the same level of dedication to quality was one finds in Football Manager (not that FM is without it's issues - but it is a very good game); but this - EHM, is not anything like its sports management brother. This game is apparently a product from developed back in 2007. And it looks like it. Important features are buried behind menus and different screens and navigating to them is far from intuitive. So your left blindly clicking hoping to find what you need. To make matters worth, some buttons are links without a hover state. So it doesn't look like a button or link, and doesn't behave like one until clicked. I discovered some features this way be accident. You can filter some lists, but I've always found this buggy. Then there's how data is laid out, which is in a busy, packed manner. Wheres FM lays things out in easy to look at, well spaced datas, organized in a pleasing and logical layout; in EHM you have glaring or just poorly chosen colors that either flash or blend with the games background. And did I mention that to date you're going to play this in windowed mode in a display resolution harkoning back pre-1080p monitors? Yes. This game doesn't know what 16:9 is.The actual games are laid out on a 2d, with stick-figure hockey sticks glued to little circles. Albeit this is better than OOTPs rendition, but its a laugh-out-loud insult to those who enjoy the live 3d action of FM.I could go on, but, to end on a positive is the community. There are update rosters and all kinds of nuggets of info to be found at http://www.ehmtheblueline.com/forums/portal.php.To be fair, to date I've put in 10hrs and aside from the horrific UI - when you get the hang of it I did have fun. But I just find the interfaces learning curve to much work that it sucks all the joy out of what could be a really fun game.Honestly, if you're a hockey fanatic get this on a massive steam sale. If not, move along.			"

												As a preface, it's possible I don't know what I'm doing. I've played 400 hours of Football Manager and have a pretty good grasp of this genre's concepts, but this game is so frustrating in many ways. First off, even moreso than in Football Manager, your team will make STUPID STUPID STUPID mistakes all game, every game. They'll take 24 PIM in a single game, your coach will put in the 4th line to dump and chase with a minute left in a game you're losing by one. Your goalie will allow goals from half ice. Your PKers will refuse to clear the puck, instead passing it into your own corner for the opposing team to pick up. Something is very wrong with this game (not to mention that it is basically just a very watered down reskin of FM) and I would not recommend it unless you absolutely NEED to have a hockey managing simulator. I've had some fun with it and will probably give it another try, but the frustration is just not worth it for a pretty mediocre, sometimes ridiculous game.			"

												The game, in my opinion offers these pros and cons:PROS- Real teams- Many world leagues (not sure if it's all of them)- Offers junior teams which is a huge plus- Unique idea of being able to create notes on your players- Unique idea of being able to request physio for individual players- You're only a GM, among a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of other staff members- You can send messages to other local GMs (other members in the household), pretty neat I guess.- Restricitions from board members, including individual player salary capsCONS- No music- Erroneous information about the teams (player names notwitstanding of course)- Very tediously complex menu system- Massive spamming system where you get notifications which has to do with every single team, in terms of trades, releases etc.- Restricitions from board members, including individual player salary caps- OMG, shoot me... as a test, I offered 3 first round picks, 2 fairly good players (4 stars in interest) for a top player, but the offer was rejected. That makes no sense.- Windowed mode as default. "

								As a huge Football Manager Fan I was absolutely hot to come up as an Icehockey Manager now. Unfortunately this is ""Early Access"", whatever this means when it comes to sell a game from the year 2006 (see other negative reviews). If you like the complexity of the FM series you got to realise you won´t find most of the possibilities here. This is a very ""light"" version of what could be possible, it´s boring as hell since you will miss the complexity you already know. And as to the marketing term ""Early Access"" - you do not know where this will lead. I would buy this again if it was sold as an oldschool 2006 game, but the label ""Early Access"" on this one makes me frown.Review will be updated when changes and patches come that change something.

												     I honestly wanted to like this game. I love ice hockey and have always wanted to play it, but, growing up in the Bay Area, I wasn't able to, so I had to turn to video games. I couldn't get into EA NHL's Be a GM mode because it quite frankly confused me. >>FAST FORWARD PAST ALL THE SCHEISSE>>. I bought the game, started it up, went to start my career and was very confused when I selected the SJ Sharks for my team, and didn't see any familiar players. So, I naturally questioned what the hell is happening, and I restarted the game to see if there was another mode I missed; there was not. Then, I tried installing something from the Steam Workshop to give me real players to work with; that didn't work either. So, at that point, I said screw it and applied for a refund.     In all seriousness, I can't recommend a hockey game with no player licensing. There's just no point. I had come to expect that from Sports Interactive, since they were able to license so many players and leagues in Football Manager 2016. If you want to see what Sports Interactive is really capable of, save your money and buy Football Manager 2016, it's an overall better game, and considering it came from the same dev, you think they'd put the same amount of time into both projects.MY REAL REVIEW- 5/10Everything about this game is fine. All it really needs is player licensing, and it's all fine.			"

												Bought this game because I always wanted to own an Icehockey Manager like in the old days when you played C64 and Amigas management games and Wayne Gretzky Icehockey for those that remeber. Also I thought this is always promoted on FM2017, so I expected more than I finally received. For me personally this game lacks a graphics engine. I would like to see my players bodychecking the other, but well.... numbers are here but grafix are not up to standards. Sorry cannot recommend right now.			"

												I like managing all of the off season stuff like in Madden Football and Hockey.  However, this one just has too much detail.  Things really are not clear.  Not having an Overall rating for players makes it way to hard to know who to trade and who to keep.  Not sure who I'm supposed to scout out of the 9,000 players out there.  Scouts don't give me any direction.  Overall just way too much going on with no real guidance from my staff.  Guess I just got to call this a failed attempt at making a fun hockey manager.			"

Early Access Review
								Very solid game and very in depth much like the FM series. This game is very detailed and there is a lot of directions you can take to help your team succeed. But, with that said this game does have its fair share of issues considering it is an early access game. The first being the player overalls, there are no player overalls which can make the game quite daunting for newcomers like myself. Given i have limited knowledge of hockey i have to just rely on my coach to do a lot of the strategizing which, in turn, takes away a key feature of the game. Also, there are a few problems with the matches in game. Although not a huge issue the matches seem to be really clunky and laggy looking. On top of this rather minor issue i hope they put in a 3-d POV in the matches because, unlike in FM, i think it is fairly necessary to have a 3-d POV to have an understanding of what is going on in the match. But, with all that said i do recommend this game to people who have the time to invest in this game leading me to give a score of 7.5/10.			"

								Took me about 2 seasons to learn this stuff, but it was worth it. At third season I won Finnish Liiga with KalPa and couldn't be more happy. I would rate this game 4/5. Awesome manager game for the most awesome sport. It needs some tweaking like resolution, but at this Early Access stage everything is on good road.I found weird bug when we got game seven in the finals KalPa-HIFK, it got scheduled 20th May and everyone who have played this game in Liiga knows that players contracts end at 30th of April. So game seven was played with missing players and different staff :D			"

I've bought the game twice (computer♥♥♥♥♥♥the bed), and it's been worth it. This game is 2007+. The foundation of the game is EHM 2007, but they're adding more content often. There's absolutely no reason why any armchair GM shouldn't buy this game. No reason.			"

Nice game to have on and play while you are surfing the net or doing something else (i.e. you don't have to give it your full attention).  Somewhat of a learning curve, but not bad especially with various youtube videos.  Be sure to get the updated real life league rosters and facepacks/logopacks, etc.			"

												If you compare this game to most other sports sims, then odds are its going to fall short. It has an extremely small development team (I think 1 person does most of the heavy lifting) which develops this game in their spare time while also working on Football Manager, which obviously has a much larger playerbase. Therefore, if you are just a fan of sports sims in general, you might want to avoid this one as it is quite outdated form a technical perspective.However, if you are a hockey fan that enjoys games like Football Manager, or alternatively likes franchise modes in games like EA's NHL series and doesn't mind not having a 3d representation of the players, then this game is a no brainer at any price.The game has a small but dedicated community over at ehmtheblueline.com, which I highly recommend checking out if you decide to get the game. I highly recommend checking out the 1998-99 TBL Retro Roster database which is available there as it has made for a really fun game so far.			"

It's easy to find real player names and faces online, and there are helpful tutorials along with them. A little bit dense to begin with but once you start remembering where the important menus are the game begins to speed up. Exactly what a hockey buff like me needs.			"

												This game makes me so angry. I honestly, despite 440 hours of mostly enjoyable gameplay, can't recommend this game to anyone.This game is so full of bugs it's stupid and what's worse is that the developer has seemingly abandoned the game altogether. When I first downloaded the game about a year ago everything was great. The dev released very frequent updates and bug fixes and everything was peachy. The game ran super fast and smoothly and while there were small problems there was nothing major that had a big effect on gameplay. These frequent updates continued until the game was finally released until December 1st, 2015, when the game was taken out of Early Access and given a full release. As a huge fan of the game I was super excited for this new ""EHM 1"". There were a lot of cool new features added and it was the biggest update I had seen thus far. Unfortunately EHM 1 would be the beginning of the steep decline in the quality of EHM. This 1.0 update was so full of bugs it was actually unplayable for a large portion of players. Myself and a ton of other users had to spend days combing online forums and google searches for solutions to the problems we faced. I remember being so frustrated that this huge update came out on December 1st but I actually couldn't play it until mid December, and even then I just kept playing a save game from an earlier version of the game because the new version was so messy.As if this disaster of an update wasn't bad enough, a lot of these bugs have gone totally unfixed even now on May 29th, 2016. Since the 12/1 full release, there have been only 3 updates to the game, the last coming out more than 3 months ago on February 17th. These updates were two minor bug fix updates and then a 1.1.1 update that added some new content to the game. The game is still in shambles, and the developer hasn't touched the game in more than 3 months. He used to release updates on a weekly basis, and now he doesn't release updates at all.Let me break down a couple of the major bugs that have made me want to pull my hair out, and keep in mind that this isn't all of them.- You can't minimize this game. If you minimize the game, or if some pop-up automatically minimizes the game you can't open the game back up. You better hope that you saved recently because all of your progress will be lost. This bug has been around since the December 1st update, and has been unsolved for almost 6 months now.- The in-game clock was completely ruined by the December 1st update. In EHM you can't play the games, you just simulate all of them. You can mess with the in-game clock settings to make it slow, medium, or fast. I can't speak for everyone, but my friends and I and a lot of other people I've seen on the online forums play the game on the fastest clock settings. We do this because we don't want to sit and watch a simulated game for a long period of time, we'd rather it just be over with as fast as possible. Before the December 1st update you could simulate a game in under 30 seconds and it was absoulutely tremendous. Being able to fly through games so fast meant that you could finish entire seasons relatively quickly and your manager's career would progress at a nice pace. The December 1st update made the clock much much slower than it was before, even on the fastest settings. That quick 20 second game suddenly took almost a minute or more to simulate. I get that a 50 second game still doesn't seem like much, but when all you can do is just sit there and watch a screen for 50 seconds you get bored really quickly. This bug actually frustrated me to the point where I just stopped playing the game completely for almost a month. It's a really boring game when you have to stare at your screen for a collective two hours and do nothing just to finish one season. Luckily I found a fix to that bug by tinkering with the settings, and I was able to play the game with a super fast clock again, until earlier today. My clock is now super slow again, and there is NOTHING I can do about it. I've already tinkered with the settings as much as I can and my clock is super slow. I'm sick about it.- The bug I talked about earlier that kept most players from playing the new update for a few days after the 1.0 release is still around for a lot of new players. Whenever you start up the game you get some error message that breaks the game. You can't open the game, you can't do anything until you go into the game's properties and change all of the resolution settings, just so you can finally open the game and change the in-game resolution settings, before you go back and reset your computer's resolution settings. You have to do all of this annoying tinkering just to be able to play the game! Come on Riz!This game is super fun, don't get me wrong. I've played more than 400 hours. Unfortunately this is a game I cannot recommend to anyone, as it is just a giant headache.I'm sure the developer Riz is working on other games, and I'm sure he's very busy. He's the only developer of this game and while I'm very thankful for all of the work he's done the fact of the matter is that this game is abandoned right now. There hasn't been an update in MONTHS, not even a tiny bug fix!! I don't understand why the guy would just let this game that he worked so hard on sit and rot.TL:DRThis game right now is a buggy pile of mush. Before it was taken out of early access it was absoulutely brilliant, but now that it has been fully released it has been completely abandoned by the developer. Only buy this game if you want to deal with a bunch of problems before you can really enjoy the game. Don't buy this game unless it's on sale.			"

								Good pickup if you like hockey and sport sim games. At $10-$15, it is a low risk purchase. Installing roster updates, face and logo packs is a must to make the game more enjoyable (instructions in the forums or with a quick google search). The menus can be a little hard to navigate. Not as in-depth as the FM games but that's to be expected with early access. I'm definitely excited to see where this game goes as there is a lot of potential. I'd be really bummed if they stopped development at this point but I wouldn't feel ripped off and would probably still play - that's a good thing.			"

								Probably one of the best GM mode games out there. Found it while on another sites Forum pages that this was a revamp of an old game that HAD gotten a lot of support and play a long time ago. I will tell you that it does not have NHL rights to all the pics and stuff but a dedicated fan base has made sure that with a little elbow grease you can have it looking and playing better than NHL 14 in a matter of hours at most. Game play has a learning curve to it but that's to be expected and once you get the hang of it there isn't one thing that you can't modify or tweak to some degree. While the other game has flash and sizzle, it, like chine food will leave you hungry for some meat and EHM-EA is it!!! I am coming up to the trade deadline of my first season and I am liking this immensely. YMMVThe only downside that I have seen is that some of the forums where you can ask questions are not that often frequented and you may have to wait..... for some time...... to get..... an answer.....I have played both FIFA 13 and NHL 14 and would play this game over either of the others AND it's available for PC......

								Started the session at 4 pm. Fell asleep playing at 5 am.But in all seriousness, I love this game. I played games from the NHL series on Xbox 360 almost solely for the GM mode, which was enough for a while. As I started getting bored (and tired of forking over that much cash) I started looking for alternatives. Finding this game was the best thing to happen. It's far more in depth, but that's a nice change of pace for me.I recommend this game, but only if you're looking for a very in depth game. If you're more of a casual player then you'll be overwhelmed and frustrated very quickly.			"

								OMG!! I was stunned to log on to Steam and find that there was a new version of Eastside Hockey Manager available on early access. I have been hoping for this for nearly a decade.I bought EHM 2007 when it first came out and play it often to this day. I still have not found another sports game nearly as addicting. Going through my saved games it looks like my total playing time on EHM 2007 is well north of 2000 hours.If you are a hockey fan, this is the game for you. Draft day steals, free agent busts, star goalies that get injured right before the playoffs, this game has it all!Currently there are a few bugs and a dreadful UI (at least compared to 2007), but I have faith that the devs will get this polished and it will be as fun as the previous versions of the game. Well worth the price!			"

It is certainly the best ice hockey managerial game!			"

												Update: Full release is finally here. Nice to see a lot of added features like multiplayer, steam workshop integration, AND better resolution support (all in one giant update at that.) Thanks for adding them. For some reason the Borderless Windowed mode doesn't go over the windows taskbar so that is a pain, but I use an external program to fix that issue.  I would love to see touchscreen support. For some reason on my Windows Tablet it requires a double tap from my finger as opposed to a single tap. If I could play this as a tablet game, my hours would only skyrocket...-------------Previous Early access reviewThis game is a lot of fun. I've recently got into hockey so its been a great way to learn about the sport.  My biggest gripe is the 1024x768 resolution. It's not even widescreen. The windowed mode is broken and never works, and the borderless windowed mode forces the game to display behind the windows taskbar which is really a pain. I'd love to see those aspects fixed along with widescreen support.			"

												This game makes me so angry. I honestly, despite 440 hours of mostly enjoyable gameplay, can't recommend this game to anyone.This game is so full of bugs it's stupid and what's worse is that the developer has seemingly abandoned the game altogether. When I first downloaded the game about a year ago everything was great. The dev released very frequent updates and bug fixes and everything was peachy. The game ran super fast and smoothly and while there were small problems there was nothing major that had a big effect on gameplay. These frequent updates continued until the game was finally released until December 1st, 2015, when the game was taken out of Early Access and given a full release. As a huge fan of the game I was super excited for this new ""EHM 1"". There were a lot of cool new features added and it was the biggest update I had seen thus far. Unfortunately EHM 1 would be the beginning of the steep decline in the quality of EHM. This 1.0 update was so full of bugs it was actually unplayable for a large portion of players. Myself and a ton of other users had to spend days combing online forums and google searches for solutions to the problems we faced. I remember being so frustrated that this huge update came out on December 1st but I actually couldn't play it until mid December, and even then I just kept playing a save game from an earlier version of the game because the new version was so messy.As if this disaster of an update wasn't bad enough, a lot of these bugs have gone totally unfixed even now on May 29th, 2016. Since the 12/1 full release, there have been only 3 updates to the game, the last coming out more than 3 months ago on February 17th. These updates were two minor bug fix updates and then a 1.1.1 update that added some new content to the game. The game is still in shambles, and the developer hasn't touched the game in more than 3 months. He used to release updates on a weekly basis, and now he doesn't release updates at all.Let me break down a couple of the major bugs that have made me want to pull my hair out, and keep in mind that this isn't all of them.- You can't minimize this game. If you minimize the game, or if some pop-up automatically minimizes the game you can't open the game back up. You better hope that you saved recently because all of your progress will be lost. This bug has been around since the December 1st update, and has been unsolved for almost 6 months now.- The in-game clock was completely ruined by the December 1st update. In EHM you can't play the games, you just simulate all of them. You can mess with the in-game clock settings to make it slow, medium, or fast. I can't speak for everyone, but my friends and I and a lot of other people I've seen on the online forums play the game on the fastest clock settings. We do this because we don't want to sit and watch a simulated game for a long period of time, we'd rather it just be over with as fast as possible. Before the December 1st update you could simulate a game in under 30 seconds and it was absoulutely tremendous. Being able to fly through games so fast meant that you could finish entire seasons relatively quickly and your manager's career would progress at a nice pace. The December 1st update made the clock much much slower than it was before, even on the fastest settings. That quick 20 second game suddenly took almost a minute or more to simulate. I get that a 50 second game still doesn't seem like much, but when all you can do is just sit there and watch a screen for 50 seconds you get bored really quickly. This bug actually frustrated me to the point where I just stopped playing the game completely for almost a month. It's a really boring game when you have to stare at your screen for a collective two hours and do nothing just to finish one season. Luckily I found a fix to that bug by tinkering with the settings, and I was able to play the game with a super fast clock again, until earlier today. My clock is now super slow again, and there is NOTHING I can do about it. I've already tinkered with the settings as much as I can and my clock is super slow. I'm sick about it.- The bug I talked about earlier that kept most players from playing the new update for a few days after the 1.0 release is still around for a lot of new players. Whenever you start up the game you get some error message that breaks the game. You can't open the game, you can't do anything until you go into the game's properties and change all of the resolution settings, just so you can finally open the game and change the in-game resolution settings, before you go back and reset your computer's resolution settings. You have to do all of this annoying tinkering just to be able to play the game! Come on Riz!This game is super fun, don't get me wrong. I've played more than 400 hours. Unfortunately this is a game I cannot recommend to anyone, as it is just a giant headache.I'm sure the developer Riz is working on other games, and I'm sure he's very busy. He's the only developer of this game and while I'm very thankful for all of the work he's done the fact of the matter is that this game is abandoned right now. There hasn't been an update in MONTHS, not even a tiny bug fix!! I don't understand why the guy would just let this game that he worked so hard on sit and rot.TL:DRThis game right now is a buggy pile of mush. Before it was taken out of early access it was absoulutely brilliant, but now that it has been fully released it has been completely abandoned by the developer. Only buy this game if you want to deal with a bunch of problems before you can really enjoy the game. Don't buy this game unless it's on sale.			"

												Very pleased with this purchase! To this point (35hrs.) One of the better sports management sims I've played. Very customizable with a prefect for me quick game presentation. 9.25/10 overall (increased rating after 35 hr mark) &  10/10 value.			"

												Got me hooked right away.  Endless amount of variations and an unreal realism that can still be made intersting.  Player stories, media, and a whole bunch more make this game too much fun.  I hope in time this can somehow be intergrated with NHL (EA) because that would be DOPE.  Think about the in depth simulation plus the gameplay.  Jeebuz, that would be something			"

												If you're a fan of manager games and a fan of hockey, then this game will be perfect for you. It has many of the same aspects of Football Manager but for hockey and it's just everything I could ask for in a hockey manager game. Highly reccomended at any price!			"

												Game is great at this point.  In early access, it was a little difficult to understand where features were and such.  Improvements have been made, and it is a finished piece.  Start Career - Buffalo SabresBoard Expectations - Improve roster little by littleDuring Season - Both Lehner and Nilsson let in over 3 goals a game-Board is happy until around game 60 when we're in 15th in conference-Attempt to steal Matt Murray in offseason for big $-Pittsburgh hordes goalies so take Chad Johnson insteadToronto Maple Leafs win cup with Matthews leading the team in scoring.

												This is an updated review as direct X problems plagued me to the point of having to play the game in a vm box.This is a complex hockey sim that's the most indepth on the market, ( eat your heart out FHM ) it's ehm 07 updated for 2016. The updates are worth it for the complexity and intricacies and for $10-20 its well worth it. EHM is a great way to kill time if you're a hockey fan or a bruding arm chair gmTo the games major downside it seems to only being devloped by one, maybe two people. Posting on the bug forum is almost a waste of time because of this.I have solved my issue with Direct X. The issue seemed based on sytem scaling settings- for your text and apps. Having it being set at anything other than 100% gave me the infamous direct x error which arised for me after the 1.2 patchPro-Complex and well done hockey simulation universe-Very detailed and the closest you'll get to being a real gm.-Ingame hockey game simulation system played out by dots-Living out hockey fantasy and/or taking control of your favourite team and winning the cup.-Amazing indepth tactical system-Great TBL (The Blue Line) community supportCon-Bad game support-Very slow updates-Compatibility issues especially with Windows 10-Salary cap doesn't go up as seasons progress.-Staff retires too early and not enough players becoming staff.-Ingame coaching is lackingI've spent a lot of hours and it always seems like theres more to learn every season. I originally gave the game a negative review, but I'm changing it to positive on reflection and solving of my direct x issues.			"

												I  don't often write reviews, but I feel like this game deserves it.  I've played a lot of sports simulation and strategy games and I have to tell you that this game REALLY deserves positve endorsement.  It performs at a level well beyond what you would expect given the level of minimal development resources its clearly been given.  1) The AI is extraordinary - you really have to plan and have a clear, well-executed strategy to be able to compete at a high level consistently year after year in this game.  If you make mistakes in player acquisition or tactically mismatch you players to your approach game in and game out, you'll see yourself drafting Top 52) The modding community is committed and you get a lot for your money because of that3) THe UI, once you understand it and get used to its clunkiness, is actually pretty good - again for what little development has been done vs. what could be done.Remember, this is from the company that does Football Manager, so you can see the quality.  But, what disappoints is what this game could be if the developer gave it anywhere near the resources it gives FM.  And I hope as this game gets more following, they will listen.Regardless, don't pass this one up.  And for goodness sake, avoid FHM2 or FHM3 like the plaugue.  This game won't do stupid trades and it will give you some real immersion beause, as I said, the AI is good and difficult to beat.Enjoy!			"
