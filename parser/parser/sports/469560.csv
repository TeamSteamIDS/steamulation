												This is a fun game and the developer is very responsive to user suggestions to improve the game further.  The indoor Mansion Alley is cool.			"

												Not very well polished. Buggy, generic music, not very realistic. You might think $20 is cheaper than going to a bowling alley, except this game is nowhere near the same realism as actually bowling.Then the worst part is that it takes itself too seriously. It could at least make up for the lack of realism by having fun with itself, but it doesn't. Instead, it just becomes boring and stale, real quick.I feel like this game was rushed out as quickly as possible as cheap as possible and charging as much as they'd think people would pay in order to cash in on the new market while it could.

												Great Game, a lot of nicely detailed environments and some good physics.-Needs a turn off music option.-Would be better if a few balls were already spawned instead of having to do it manuallly everytime i start a new game.-A few more sound effects and a choice of how many frames can be played would be a nice option.If your looking for a vr bowling game, i would recommend this one for the price.

												Several different scenes to bowl in. The bowling mechanics are good, but not perfect. Sometimes I feel like strikes are a bit too easy, but on average my scores are pretty close to what they were the last time I went bowling. The music options are a nice touch.I'd like to be able to teleport around the whole scene though. Currently you can only teleport around the bowling platform, and throw balls at things in the scenery. You can break POTS and smash random things around the bowling alleys though, so I hope they add the option to teleport as well.(purchased during steam sale for about $6)			"

												Luv Luv Luv HYPER BOWLING VR  I love everything about thIs game. Great Bowling Alleys.  Beautiful Bowling Balls.  Lots of choices.  Quick response.  Friendly avatars hanging out with you.  Cool music. Teleporting.  A perfect combination of realism and VR.  If you like to bowl, which I do, you're going to love Hyper Bowling VR.  If you don't care for bowling, this game just might change your mind.  Oh, you've got to spend sometime in the Disco Bowling Alley.  For a moment I thought I could teleport over to the dance floor and get a groove on with the avatars.  HYPERR BOWLING VR is without doubt on the top of my favorites list with Two Thumbs Up.			"

												It's kinda fun, it's alot better than that other Vive bowling game. If you don't mind paying the high price tag for single player bowling then go for it. Since choices are slim on Vive games atm. I may keep it but I sure hope the Developer plans to improve it. I wish it atleast claim to be early access because it needs a lot more polish. Graphics are rather ugly, multiplayer is not included, and in my opinion is a requirment. It appears to be using a $30 Unity Assets pack with a few added stock images. Balls just stick anywhere on the controller when grabbed which is strange not being in a standard location. For now I'll keep it as a thumbs up but only because it's the best bowling on Vive.			"

												Very fun game! I have been wanting an accurate sports game to play with the Vive using the hand controllers, and this game seems like less of a gimmick and more of what it would feel like to go to an actual bowling alley. I've even hit pins dead on, but I don't get spares or strikes unless I add extra spin to the ball which is what happens to me when I actually go bowling! This game really challenges my bowling skills and forces me to improve. The scenery is an extra bonus that is really relaxing and enjoyable to look at, especially in VR. Overall it's a very enjoyable game that I would recommend to anyone interested in bowling or just to have a good time.			"

												Not really worth the money, and I purchassed it on sale.  The bowling in VR Sports is way better.			"
