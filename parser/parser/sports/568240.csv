Early Access Review
								I really love ping pong VR games even though I can’t play ping pong in real life for nuts.Previously I have tried VR Ping Pong, Eleven: Table Tennis, Paddle Up and now here comes a new challenger! Check out this article for the review.Kung Fu Ping Pong is a game with1) Cute graphics kinda like kungfu panda – Kids will love it2) Easy to play mechanics – for people who want to just have an easy time playing a casual table tennis game / not for the simulator fans, try other VR Ping Pong games3) Interesting boss powers to add variety to gameplay like bombs and nunchucksIt is a very short early access game with limited variety of gameplay but for its price of just $1+, I think that is a great casual game that you can grab for some fun with friends.Support it so that the developer can continue to add more content to the game!Check out my gameplay video here on my VR youtube channel.
