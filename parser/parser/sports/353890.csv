												Being a Lacrosse player myself, I found this game to be a blast. I spent most of my time on career mode maxing out my shooting stat and smoking the hell out of goalies. This game, atleast in my opinion, shows the guts and such of the game of Lacrosse. Now I do think its a little over the top on the hitting, considering straight up flattening someone isnt legal all of the time depending on where you get them at. I find this game to fit as a fun past-time and just a sort of ""chill-out"" game.Thanks for reading my crappy review.			"

NOTE: I value opinions of those on the opposite side of the fence, but please don't delegitmize a sport that has a college and professional scene. Try to be respectful and avoid debate about the popularity of Lacrosse vs another. There is a group of people who enjoy the sport, let them enjoy it. Now for the reviewAll I can say is WOW ....and what the f@#k am I doing?I know absolutely nothing about Lacrosse so questioning the integrity and authentic nature of the game is something I can not do.

												I have already put 37 hours into this game since getting it early. So I am going to try and make an in-depth tutorial. I was a backer for this game when the crowdfunding campaign failed in the fall of 2013, as well as when the crowdfunding successfully was achieved in 2014. So, I have been waiting for this game for awhile, lol. I fully recommend this game! It captures the realism of lacrosse and for the first legitimate lacrosse game ever, EVER, it well exceeded my expectations. The graphics I have seen on youtube are amazing, I have a weak machine so I have the equivilent of xbox or Playstation 2 graphics, and still have put already 37 hours onto the game. So if you have a weak PC do not be discouraged, I still think it is a great buy. PROS: - Realistic Lacrosse, AI responds as they would in a real-game. - Good shooting animations and controls- Commentary is basic, but good- AI is hard to beat! I played on Sophmore difficulty (2nd easiest of the 5 difficulties) and I still barley can win at times.- A good amount of scoring, but not all games end 20-18, sometimes lower scoring like 6-5. -THE BEST PRO: To me, the customization in this game is unreal. If you like creating players and Teams, ORDER THIS GAME NOW. It is my favorite part of any sports game and this one makes by far the best creation-centre. CONS: I think many of these wrinkles will get smoothened out in the next game and/or updates.-The game has no indication when quarters will end! There should be a beep or something when there is 5 seconds left in a quarter. All of the sudden, the play stops and the quarter will end. - The sprinting is ♥♥♥♥, you get short sprint bursts which then regenerate after a short time.- Glitchy celebrations, players run through other players and the nets- The goalies can make saves, but sometimes when they let in goals they look like blind vegetables- Defense was really hard to get at first, learning what buttons truley did what. - No tutorial to teach basic lacrosse rules or the gameplay (Like I said, defense was hard to learn)- Apparently, no customization to players after career mode beginI would give this game a 9/10, I love it so far and the thing is I give it that grade and THIS IS THE FIRST LACROSSE GAME EVER! Many more to come with better improvements!			"

												In all honesty its a great game and definently worth buying; however it's definently not $50 worth. The only REAL next gen thing about this game is graphics. Most of the game mechanics are kind of a let down. There is also many glitches to encounter with in this game. For instants, celebrating after a goal,  you may phase right through the net. It's not game breaking but frankley unproffesional of the developers. As a defencive player in high school, I have found the defence in this game insulting. Sorry if I offend anyone, but it almost makes us look ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. And the goalies, I know there is a ton of scoring in lacrosse (I play it) but, the goalies reactions are terrible as well. Not because they can't save anything, it's because there movements are choppy and not fluent, smoothe. If you dissagre with me I totally get, but I have been waiting for this game since the fund raised, and kinda have been disappointed with the outcome. I know you developers in a lot of hard work, and i appreciate it, but some of these mistakes are impossible to miss. I cannot get past the part I had to go out and buy a new controller to be able to play this. No keyboard support, REALLY? Don't get me wrong I do love this game, and I'd love to see some updates for future improvement. But for the time being I really do not believe this should be a $50 game.			"

												Simply put, this game is not worth $50. It is basically a reskin of the games for Xbox they released several years ago with added career modes. I played Lacrosse at the DIII level and while this game does do some things well, it gets bogged down by an unexplained control scheme, poor AI, and wonky physics. Half-field offense is extremely difficult as is 1v1 dodging because you can never accurately judge when the D can take the ball away from you. Defensive players simply charge the ballcarrier and slide up-field with no regard to team defense, turning the game into a fast break simulator. This is a good start and I will pick it up again when the price drops to around $15-20. Hopefully they get the opportunity to make another and focus on improving the AI and tweaking the little things so that the game can accurately reflect the half-field game which is where the majority of the game is played.

												I really like the other games from Big Ant (especially Don Bradman Cricket 14, but Rugby League 3 too) and I bought Lacrosse 16 because it's from them. I had never seen a Lacrosse game before, I only knew it's a rather exotic sport from Canada and I was curious. And hey, it is like Ice Hockey on grass. Similar pace, similar fun, similar rules, easy to learn. The controls (especially the shooting) seemed strange to me at first (moving the right stick instead of pressing a button), but I got used to them and won some matches already. I love sports games, and I love them even more if they are not from EA and cost less than EA's games.			"

												Uh wow.  Really fun!  I've never played Lacrosse (real or game), but this is really great.  Still learning the controls - don't think they are mappable - but I'm enjoying it.  Have only played a couple of casual games, but I can't wait to get into the career stuff.  With all the hoopla surrounding disappointing big-budget releases (XCom2, The Division, WWE 2k16), it was really refreshing to see this game blow all of those out of the water.  Clean, polished, looks great and you'd think it was an EA title, without the sucking.  A+			"

												Kickstared this game back in 2014 was supposed to come out in 2015.  However, totally worth the wait.  Visually the game looks amazing up there with NHL and FIFA 16.  Passing, shooting, and slashing controls are perfect.  Also the player, team, league, and even referee and coach creation is a plus.  The only complaint I have is the dekes could be a bit less jerky.  Hopefully this game does well and we can get another in 2017 and wouldn't mind some box lacrosse added as well.			"

												If you are like me and have been waiting for a legitimate lacrosse game to come out for over seven years, than buy it without hesitation because this game will feel like the best thing since sliced bread.  Yes it has some glitches and a few issues here and there, but considering it had a low budget and it has good graphics AND ITS A FREAKING GAME ABOUT LACROSSE, it's amazing. It is also a pretty good way to learn about the sport if you are just picking it up. Yet with that being said, if you are just looking to pick upo a quality sports game that isn't from EA, you might find this a bit lackluster in comparison to AAA franchises such as Fifa and Madden. Overall I recommend this game, especially if you love lacrosse.P.S. None of the teams are licensed, meaning they have fake team and player names. However this can be fixed by simply selecting YES when the game starts up and asks you about downloading the most popular team set-ups created by the community.			"

												I think that this game is amazing. I will give the creators props because this game is probably the first lacrosse game I have seen. As a Lax player, I think that this game interprets lacrosse perfectly. The only suggestion is: Please make the goalie position playable!!! that would be amazing. I love playing goalie ( for that is what I strive to play, right now I play D.) and I just hope there could be an update to make the goalie position playable. Other than that, a great game! Ps. I have a laptop, and it is very laggy, so I would recomend that you have a PC to play this game, but I still play it because I love Lacrosse. Great job Developers!!!			"

												I always wanted to make a lacrosse game, NEVER in my wildest dreams did I EVER think not only a lacrosse game would be available EVER on PC, but an amazing lacrosse game that has made me one of the happiest gamers in the world. This game rocks, graphics are great, controls are great, presentation is good, stats are great, edit/create is good, this game is better then what I imagined a lacrosse game should be. This game needs to get more recognition, sports titles are extremely rare on PC's today, our only options are the #$%^ EA games. I am forever humble that these devs and supporters made this game a reality. Thank you from the bottom of my heart! Lacrosse Rocks! I just happened to run into this game browsing titles.......I couldn't believe it.Graphics: 9Sound/Audio: 9Controls: 8Replay Value: 9In short, ß@Ð@$$!Ps, rating a game crappy because your intergrated video card can't handle this game is stupid. This game does require a decent PC to run it. I have a few, my Pentium I7 PC's with 970+ GTX and 16+ gb with SSD drives had NO ISSUES, NO SLOW DOWN ON MAX SETTINGS! My living room PC which has an IDE HDD, AMD 6 core, 8 gbs ram and GTX 750 ti runs it okay, but there will be skipping and stuttering when passing and shooting. This game is taxing, and will require a 1000 PC to run on MAX SETTINGS, you can still run this game very well if you tweak your graphics on a low end PC. You should never expect games of this caliber to play with intergrated video.			"

												Casey Powell 16 is an excellent game that captures the speed, physicality, look and sound of field lacrosse, plus it strikes a good balance between being a fun sports title and a realistic sports sim.On the field, the controls are tight and responsive ensuring fluid offensive and defensive play, while the AI keeps a realistic flow to play and player movements. It really does look and feel like lacrosse. And speaking of looks, this game looks fabulous. The players, field, and stadium are all decked out in lush current gen graphical goodness. Note: More on graphics below.) For an indie game, it has the visual look and feel of a big studio product and in my opinion this makes CP16 a milestone achievement for a crowd funded game. And there’s plenty of ways to get to the field - there’s single games, a decent (but not overly deep) career mode, and tournament modes.And special mention for the excellent Lacrosse Academy in-game editor that gives you the ability to fully manage tactics, rosters, and starting lineups, plus create custom teams, players, coaches, and even referees. While this game doesn’t carry official licenses from either the NCAA or Major League Lacrosse, the developers have invented a fabulous trick the very first time you start the game. The first time you turn on the game you have the option to update all the rosters to the highest rated teams available from the community through the Lacrosse Academy. That means you can instantly update your rosters from the generic teams that come with the game to 67 real NCAA teams or the nine MLL pro teams. Granted, there’s not official logos for any of the college or pro teams, but it’s a great feature and one that I hope other studios picks up on with their titles.With all that said, here’s the downer. As noted above, this game is beautiful but be forewarned that you’re going to need a powerful PC to play with decent graphics. This is an all out current gen game and to get the max out of the graphics (PS4 or Xbox One equivalent) you’re going to need a rocket ship of a PC.All in all, as a representation of the game of field lacrosse, this game is very well done and compares to any sports game offered by 2K, EA, or other big outfits. Even if you’re not a lax guy, this is a great sports title.Now how about that box lacrosse title?			"

												First of all the price of this game is WAY to much and should be worth $30 max.(its $50 now) The game and ideas are great,but  there are poblems .... Installing the game and playing for the first time there was no tutorial or practice mode where u could really learn the controls. I found the controls on the difficult side to memorize, and jumping right into a game was overwhelming. I started with manual controls to switch players ect but found it wouldnt switch to the person i wanted and would go to someone across the field that couldnt even be in the play. i found that alone extremely frustrating, because it made defense impossible. I then switched to automatic and that as well went to players on attack while i was playing D. I found offense very easy and playable, at times the game would pass to the wrong person but i guess that takes practice to aim it to the right person. The annoying stuff on offense would be if a offensive player passed it across midline to defense. which causes you to lose the ball and its just annoying.. why would i want to pass there? While playing defense u can really only be one player therefore AI in the game is supposed to cover the other players that cut through. AI did not do this so i pretty much played a 6 on 1 because my AI teamates litterally stood still and did nothing. I would recomend the game if what above is fixed... as of right now dont buy it for $50, its only really fun while playing with a friend and that means u have to buy another controller or they have to buy the game themself.

												This game was in the works for quite some time. It was originally called LAX 15... Majority of the time wasted making this game didnt go into actual gameplay. It went to getting its kickstarter backers in the game. The devs were completely quiet about the release date for a long time and then when they finally released it decided all those kickstarter funds werent enough, so they slapped a 50 dollar price tag on something which should be 30 at most. The gameplay is ok at best and there isnt much to it. If this game was priced at 25 bucks id say absolutely yes and thumb it up without thinking about it because its lacrosse and i can play it on my pc. However, the devs got greedy and asked for 50. Thank you for bringing a lax game but some of the ways you did it sucked. Hope to see better from you guys next year i will change my review when the price drops			"

												Garbage.  The gameplay was choppy and lagged every time there was a possession change regardless of what I did to adjust the settings, and even during momentary times of somewhat smooth play the game still lacked any sort of feel of anymore than something that belongs as a cellphone game or freeware.  It does seem to offer a lot of features, but that ended up mostly just being a distraction that caused me to surpass the playtime limit for me to be eligible for a refund...at least I learned that lesson in case there ever comes a 'next time'.  If it was possible for a downloaded game to collect dust, this game would surely find itself covered in a thick layer of it very quickly.

												If you loved Big Ant previous works : AFL, Don Bradman and Rugby League, you might , like me, be tempted to buy Lacrosse 16. I must say i barely saw any lacrosse before so I kinda discovered the sport at the same time so maybe all is normal for a lacrosse game but hell , this game is extremely frustrating.At some points in the game , your team goes on to miss a tons of simple passes, like two guys 5 meters apart walking without any opponants  around and ... WHAM overthrow 1 meter away. Of course it happen to the opposing team also but it's usually cause you presure them.The AI is completly messed up also , my defensive middie rushed to a lose ball on the ground , touched it with his stick and ... runned away allowing an easy counter attack and goal. The groundball handling by the AI is catastrophic , i doubt any Lacrosse player would be so scared of the ball. The interception is also entierly handled by the AI , even if you control a player, the AI take in charge the interception.At some points, i tried to create a user team and entered a competition and suddenly some of my players went from 84 overall to 46 without an explanation or a choice. Maybe I was a fool to expect a gameplay similar to NHL or Handball games but I always feel like you don't control anything. The user gameplay is not bad at all the control are well thought so that you can understand most of it after a few hours only but the  game itself  and the user experience is bad.I regret having gave this much time to convinced myself that it was a fun game because now the refund time is way gone.Oh, and let's be honest , 3.0GHz processor minimum for what is shown to us is a clear waste of ressources (XCOM 2 was 2Ghz for a lot more display, the graphic rendering is very fine though for the card asked)Conclusion : If you like the lacrosse sport, give it a try , it's better than nothing, other, be very careful , you might be wasting your time.PS : I played junior difficulty to learn the game and then switched to senior.

												Was incredibly excited when I saw this come out, and decided to bite the full price. Tried to start it up, immediately crashes steam and never starts. When I restart steam it says the game is running and doesn't show in any of my running processes. I'm on windows 8.1, I tried restarting and reinstalling the game to no avail. I'm more than a little unhappy I just paid $50 for a game that doesnt even start.			"

												How does this game not support PC??? Apparently it's controller only! please make it for PC and support Keyboard. I wasted 50 bucks for this game for nothing! You should have mentioned that it ws controller only!			"

												This game is so ♥♥♥♥ing boring. Shots are glitchy as ♥♥♥♥. Passing never goes the way you want. Defending is just RNG. Maybe if this game was $15 it would be alright, but $50 is ridiculous.			"

												This game is a step in the right direction but still has many flaws. Still a very fun game, buy if you have an interest or are a fan of lacrosse. Hopefully this game will be updated in the future to fix some of the issues.			"

												AS much as I love lacrosse, this game doesn't live up to the hype, and can't even run correctly even on the lowest graphics, to broaden this statement, I least wanted to run with no lag apon the fps, but couldnt even achieve that dream :(			"

												I could never get the game to play on my windows 7 laptop. whenI I asked for a refund I was denied , because they said I played for 13 hours, I didnt even get a chance to play for 1 minute. I would not recommend you purchase this game, and I just waisted $49.99 of my hard earned money. Thanks Steam for such great costomer service! NOT!!!			"

												if youre like me, and have been waiting patiently since you were a young man for the 'madden' of lacrosse games, this is it. its not perfect, but there is a ton of customization options, league editing, myplayer and coach modes, tight gameplay for the most part, the game is cool. def pricey, but has everything you would expect from any other major sport video game release. hopefully this isn't a one off, devs did a great job with this and i would love to see this game evolve. o, an runs butter too :D			"

												7/10. Pretty accurate representation of men's LacrossePros+ All players have their eyes completely covered by their visors so you don't need to worry about any nerds sporting 2nd bar+ The gameplay is fast paced and fun+ (Oddly) deep player creation systemCons- I have yet to hear anyone on the bench scream something like ""yard sale"" or ""Wesley Pipes"" so the game is inaccurate in that sense- The hair options don't allow for disgusting mullets so no flow :/- Pretty sure the refs are blind- CPU RARELY uses stick checks, they just go straight for body checks which gets tiring after a while			"

												Overall the game is fun and has many features. However, I find that the controls are a bit stiff and delayed and the graphics can be buggy with framerate issues during gameplay. The issues that are present do not outweigh the overall game in any meaningful way.			"

												Finally, a quality lacrosse game. Easily worth the $50. There are some kinks but overall it is an excellent adaptation of a severely underrated sport.Pros:* Graphics* Infinite customization options* Realistic shooting, passing and checking* Games can be low scoring and dominated by defense, or they can be high scoring shootouts decided by the offense.* Sprinting is realistic - Most games have a sprint button that you press for the entire game. This game only allows sprinting in short bursts, after which you need to wait for that player to recharge. Saving your sprint until right after a dodge can decide whether the possesion ends in a goal or a turnoverCons:* The game isn't lacrosse ""smart"". Instead of being careful near the crease the you will run straight through it* The wing middies are slow to react to the loose ball on a faceoff* It's a shame the gamemakers couldn't get the rights to use the MLL teams and players, and instead used knockoffs. The customization is a decent work around but the MLL should have agreed for free just to get some publicity.Some of the issues are a bit much to expect from the first decent lacrosse game available, but hopefully this is the first of many.

												Honestly, this game is more like hockey then lacrosse, although I mostly got this game for the physics and gameplay of hockey, lacrosse isn't bad. I mostly use the New Jersey Knights and crush keepers, I win 10-1. I so; strongly recommend to use a controller, game isn't really woth $50 (maybe $30). I have only seen one glitch so far which I hope Big Ant Studios reads this post to fix this glitch, sometimes the player walks right through the net on a celebration, but that's about it. I hope they lower the price or put this game on sale, I don't think it has been on sale just yet, also two more things. The skill level of the AI is not what you're looking for, it's the skill level of the team. That increases the difficultness. I found that there is no option to increase or decrease the players skill level. Also, graphics are very sweet and very realistic. Well let me go wrap this post up before I type up a whole book here.			"

												I'll keep it short and simple,If you want a game with great controls, great control customization, great team customization, great player customization, or even okay commentators,You came to the wrong place you ♥♥♥♥ heads. This is the complete opposite.At max, it is worth 15 dollars. (It's sad because there are virtually no lacrosse games out there, and I would love it if someone made a semi-decent one just so that no one buys this piece of garbage again. Embarassment to the developers and the sport.)			"
