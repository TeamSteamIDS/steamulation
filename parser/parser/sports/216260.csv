												9.5/10If you are a cricket fan this is the game for you, it is superbly done by Big Ant Studios.The batting and bowling feel authentic and the ball physics are just spectacular, the only down sides and the are only a few: - You cant (as yet) change the lineups of squads during a career- The animations for fielding and catching a little strange sometimes and regular nutty catch angles happen when a straight forward catch would have sufficed.- The AI is stupidly good at running you out can be a little unfair at times, and in the whole time ive played, mostly simulated for bowling, but I still havent managed to create a runout.- Animations for quick yes then no calls can result in a buggy  player and can sometimes end up in a run out because the batsmen didn't put his bat down.Update: Recent updates to the game have made it more enjoyable to play, see patch notes for further details.Finished one of my Careers, a little disappointed in the end, you cant even view your stats at the end of your career.  Very few things would need to be added to make this the game even better: - Such things would be better stat displays, - Being able to change lineups during career, - If possible auto updating database with new players every season, - More varied and better looking animations for batting, bowling, fielding.  - Dynamic Weather/modified current weather system.But other then those few things this is in incredible game from this studio, the physics are superb, you actually feel like you earn't the edge behind or that LBW. Definately would recommend if you are a serious cricket player.Looking forward to DBC 17.			"

												It's rare to find a decent Cricket game since the mid-90s to mid-2000s. During this time it was a battle of two publishers: Electronic Arts and Codemasters. Early iterations of the game were fun and lacked the realism that most sports games demand. If you're considering DBC 14 I also recommend searching for EA's Cricket 96 (PC) or Codemaster's Shane Warne Cricket 99 (PS1) on eBay. But back to more current matters. DBC 14 is by far the most authentic cricket game since the EA Sports release of Cricket 2005 for the PC and PS2. Running the game for the first time, you are met with an update that thankfully changes all player names to real names. I hope to see an update in the future that contains real stadium names too. Once in the game, you have various game options from 5-over a side to full blown test cricket. You can also create yourself and move up the ranks of world cricket.The practice arena is great too, reminiscent of a training nets session. From time to time I find myself relaxing in the nets just having a hit. I've only accumulated a few hours on the PC version but I did so, migrating from the XBOX 360 version. DBC 14 has a solid frame rate and feels very smooth. One aspect that still needs improving is the commentary. While not bad, it's not great. It's certainly not as annoying as other sports games (like PES) but not as smooth or free flowing. I love the camera angles in this game. When playing solo, you are shown your player from the 3rd person perspective. While this is standard fare for bowling in all cricket games, it's quite refreshing for batting and makes the game feel more authentic. Fielding is decent too and the camera angles during play are superb.At the time of writing this, I'm in search for games during the Steam sale. However I was quite willing to drop the full price for this game for two reasons: Supporting not just a local developer, but one that is willing to put the time and effort to capture a sport that itself has captured millions around the world.

												Well and truly the best cricket game ever made.It still has problems, of course, but there has never been such an in depth cricket game. Don Bradman Cricket 14 is very challenging no matter the difficultly, and when you win you feel a real sense of achievement. Avid cricket fans will love this, as there is so much to it. It's as much a cricket simulation as there might ever be.Well done, Big Ant Studios.			"

												As someone who doesn't come from a background steeped in cricket knowledge or history (I'm American), I wasn't really sure what to expect, but cricket holds a certain novelty for me, and I wanted to give this game a try. Not only am I glad I did, but it has become one of my favorite sports games of all-time.Tl;dr - If you're a fan of the sport, this is simply a must-have. If you have a passing interest, this game could actually help your understanding of the sport and also happens to be extremely fun and satisfying.On the surface, just like baseball, cricket is a simple game: throw the ball, hit the ball, catch the ball, curse under your breath when you're out. Just like baseball, though, there is an immense amount of strategic subtlety, and unlike America's pastime, cricket has a much wider range of strategic nuance, offering endless combinations of fielders and bowling styles. DBC14 captures the essence of that strategy by putting players in complete control of their fielding alignments and customizing them for bowlers, batsmen, or both.Which brings me to the crux of cricket and of DBC14 - what goes on at that little brown strip in the middle of the field. Bowlers are offered a wide array of options, especially pace bowlers. Toy with line and length, swing the ball to and fro, whatever you want to do to go for wickets. All this complexity is broken down into a relatively straightforward control scheme that is easy to learn but difficult to master. Pace bowling is definitely harder to get the timing on than spin bowling, but it's the pace men who offer the most excitement and get the most wickets.Batting is also somewhat straightforward. Batsmen have the ability to survey the field and get ideas on how to attack it, can choose to go for a shot in the air or along the ground or play a sweep. It's all mapped out quite cleanly, but the big key I found was timing; especially with pace bowlers, getting a good feel for the rhythm of the deliverly lets batsmen time the ball up and crush it. If the player is in rhythm, it's not difficult to churn out 20-30 runs an over, especially in T20 when bowlers are more aggressive. By that same token, mistime a big swing for the ropes, and you're down a wicket. Bowling AI is smart and will adjust even within overs to cover areas where you're consistently putting the ball, forcing you to stay on your toes and play an all-round innings at the crease.I will say that running and fielding felt a bit clunky. It was tough to know if I had hit the ball right to a man in the field because of the way the camera swings around, and (at least early on) I had a few run-outs because I got a little trigger-happy, but I also missed out on runs because I couldn't see where the ball was. It'd be helpful, too, when fielding, to have a diagram of where each button throws the ball. I still don't have it down and will find my fielder throwing at the bowler's stumps when the keeper has the other batsman dead to rights. Ultimately, though, I can forgive those things because the most important aspects of the on-field experience are just so strong.The game has a variety of ways to play the sport, with all the Test nations, the three major domestic leagues (England, Australia, and India), and a bevy of formats covered, and if you don't like what's on offer, players can create their own content through the Don Bradman Academy, a robust customization engine where everything can be tweaked. (And, since this game contains little or no licensed content, players can create their own approximations of modern cricketers and teams). Players can also create their own leagues, tournaments, tour schedules, and even formats of the game through the DBA. It's a wonderful little tool that adds tremendous depth to what could have otherwise been a rather pedestrian between-match experience, and it might be my favorite feature of the entire game.I guess my biggest complaints are the lack of licensed content (addressed by the Don Bradman Academy system, but it's not quite the same), and the menu music. They only included a handful of tracks that get quite tiresome after a while, and I haven't found any way to add custom music to the game. That would be a wonderful feature that would keep me playing this game forever. Heck, I'm probably playing this game forever anyway. Run, don't walk, to buy Don Bradman Cricket 14.			"

												Don Bradman Cricket 14 is the greatest cricket game I have ever played.The developer, Big Ant Studios, have really gone above and beyond to create a cricket game that is vastly different to previous cricket games. The batting and bowling are completely revamped.Instead of using the d-pad to choose which direction to hit the ball and the face buttons to choose what type of shot to play, batting involves using both the left and right analog sticks. The left analog stick is used to choose which foot to play (i.e front or back foot) and the right stick dictates which direction you want to play the shot. Holding the bumper buttons and flicking the right stick in the direction you want to hit the ball, produces different shots. For example, holding the left trigger button with the left stick causes you to hit a lofted shot. It takes a bit of getting used to, but once you master the controls, it feels very intuitive, vastly superior to previous cricket game controls and a lot of fun.Bowling has also been changed for the better. Instead of having a dot on the ground and showing your opponent where you are going to bowl, there is a new control scheme. First, you have to choose the length of the ball that you want to bowl, using the face buttons (i.e A for good length, B for short length or Y for full length). As your bowler approaches the crease, you flick back the right stick and then flick forward in the direction you want to bowl the ball. This is an amazingly new and fresh way to bowl in cricket games. It allows for a more authentic bowling experience and is alot more fun and engaging, then placing a dot on the pitch and just passively pressing buttons. I can't believe the day where I would say that bowling is potentially more fun than batting in a cricket game.Graphics are nice and crisp. The grounds are rendered really well and the lighting is top-notch.Sounds of the bat hitting the ball are satisfying to hear and the appeals of bowlings are exciting.Overall, Don Bradman Cricket 14 is an amazing sports game. It is definitely up there with other sports games such as FIFA and the NBA 2K games, in terms of realism, fun and authenticity. A must-have for all cricket fans and even just fans of sports in general.9/10.			"

												Best Cricket game ever made, if not one of the best sports games i have ever played!Very addictive, you cant just play 1 game at a time. Just starting out in a career as a 16 year old fast bowler/batsman. The ability to simulate the game until it is your turn to bat or bowl is good if you don't want to sit around and watch the others pile on the runs while you sit in the pavilion waiting your turn.Big thumbs up to Big Ant Studios for producing an amazing game. If you love Cricket then this is a must, if you don't this is still a great sports game and a great way to set foot in the the amazing sport.			"

												Arguably the best Cricket game ever, and I've played many. If not, it's certainly near the top.Nice graphics, excellent gameplay, patches released on a regular basis. There is realism, depth (batting especially will take a little while to get the hang of), and room for the community to step in and create players, teams and umpires. And there is a long-awaited CAREER MODE, where you start as a 16 year old and work your way up from County/State/Province-level to International selection.There isn't a large amount of stadia, but this is to be expected of a first release. Clearly gameplay has been the focus and DBC14 is better for it.In my opinion, DBC14 is worthy of the 'Don Bradman' branding. Well done Big Ant on hitting this one for six.P.S. You will need a controller, which I think is a good move, I couldn't imagine playing this on a keyboard.			"

												The best cricket game, I have ever played. + Batting and bowling is quite realistic.+ With the help of Cricket academy in game, you can get all original players/teams from international as well as club level.+ Career mode is quite innovative, where you have to play with a batsman/bowler and rise up the ranks to get selected at international level. The only problem in this mode is that, the difficulty can get increased if you start doing well, and you need very good reflexes to bat at difficulties above PRO. Also, you cannot change the batting order of your player, at any point of time in career mode.+ There are lots of options to customise the game - pitch settings/weather/overs, etc.+ Game can get real addictive, once you know the basics.+ Great graphics and animations.- Online system is quite broken, but if you have friends who own the game, then it's easy to play matches with them.-  I know it's not much, but you cannot see the bowling statistics fully in the scoreboard. Also, some other statistics which were present in the EA versions of cricket are absent.- No auto save features while playing. You only have an option to Save and Quit the game.- The AI hardly ever makes a mistake. (//Rant)Overall 9/10. Note: You need to own a controller to play the game.			"

												In short: this is the best cricket game I've ever played.  The controls felt really strange initally, but just playing the demo and batting in the nets was a strangely satisfying experience.  I enjoy all the disciplines and being able to be succesful actually requires skill.  I can't claim to be very good at anything in this game, but it feels very similar to my real-life cricketing abilities, so there's that.I've spend the majority of my time playing the career mode in this game.  It feels pretty realistic, except that with some of my performances, i'm sure my county should have left me out of some games.  Is the game perfect?  No.  The commentary is pretty inaccurate and repetitive.  There's a lot of missed catches for seemingly no reason.  And although I enjoy bowling, sometimes it's really hit-and-miss about how to dismiss a batsmen.  But as that's similar to the real thing, I guess that can't be a complaint.If you enjoy cricket games, buy it.  There's nothing I've played that's come close.			"

												simply fantastic, Big Ant did a brilliant job with this game!and I remember watching a friend of mine, Twistie3, playing this on a livestream, with Ross, the CEO or something like that of Big Ant, and it just blew me away, it was like something I had never seen before! So, of course I bought it the day it came  out on PS3 then several months later on the PC. The mods are astounding for this game, the things some people can do, yes the gameplay can get a tad boring at times, but it's all the variety that makes it so great, so many modes to choose from. the graphics are quite fancy aswell, and quite realistic.Overall, my favourite game in my steam library (maybe 2nd to bad rats) I would reccomend DBC 14 to anyone who is a fan of cricket, and my crappy old computer can run it, so you can too!FINAL SCORE - 9.5 / 10 (only 9.5 because of all the times i have been bowled for a duck)			"

												Amazing game , the only dislike i have is the fielding when catching can be buggy ,for example the change of direction some players seam to glitch (idk how to describe it someone back me up lol) and it just looks so unnatural and awkward , also the game difficulty is very realistic , as an avid crickiter and supporter (Durham and England) i feel this game does cricket justice i struggle to win on pro never mind expert so hats off to those who do , batting is fluid , bowling the same , probably one of the best sports games i've played , the devs should feel very very proud of this game its an absolute masterpiece , one thing i would like for the next game is more name licenses that would really complete it and obviously with no other cricket games been made this shouldn't be to hard other than the cost which is a stumbling block ,however thanks some people you can download all the real name squads anyway .

[EDIT]I nominated this game for the Steam Award of 2016. Under nomination of "" The “I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award” Award, I believe this title didn’t have a huge marketing machine behind it, but I and million cricket followers found it and loved it. Then they told their friends about it. And they loved it. And now this little game that could, is about to win an award (hopefully).Let's go to an actual review then. At its most scintillating, Don Bradman Cricket 14 is a challenge of patience and nerves. The batter waits and waits, only to compress technique, judgement, critical thinking and agility into a fraction of a second. The ball passes and the batter spends the next minute absorbed in contemplation, replaying the ball, his stroke, pondering the movement off the pitch, re-calculating the threat posed while battling their own demons of self-doubt.    It's this combination of fear, and technical ability  shrunk into a second that digital translations of cricket have never been able to capture. For all their computational prowess, ability to handle the multiple algorithms (a.k.a. procedural generation) determining small details like the variable bounce of a pitch, the aloofness of the English weather, or even something as fundamental as giving the red cherry a proper sense of gravity, developers have never been able to use the power of computers to imbue cricket games with any authenticity.    If you’re a cricket fan, this is absolutely essential. If you are a cricket fan and a gamer, this is a game you really want to own. Remember though this is more a cricket simulator than an arcade classic and as such you are going to be spending your first few hours figuring out exactly how the game plays.    In the end, and I have to mention this, the match of Don Bradman Cricket 14 plays out like cricket should. Yes, it doesn't come close to other sports games produced by the giants in the market when you speak in terms of graphics and the budget, but Big Ant Studios paid their attention to where the attention requires the most, in the gameplay, and that is where the giants corporations lack the most. I would say, if you have any slightest intention to buy this game, I would say buy it. You will not regret it, I promise you.			"

												This is a must have for all cricket fans.  Since EA and Codemasters don't make cricket games anymore, we are only left with Big Ant's DBC.  The kind of effort put in the game by the devs is really commendable in this game. The batting and bowling feels great, although there is a steep learning curve and one needs patience to master it.  There is a great career mode which is quite long. One can customize tournaments and play T20s, ODIs, tests, and many other tournaments. All in all, this is the most realistic cricket game ever released. Already played 250+ hours.  Highly recommended.			"

												Don Bradman Cricket has it's quirks while out on the field. Picking up the ball that is simply lying on the ground can be quite the task. Batting in multiplayer can also present a few problems most notably when they are deciding whether to run or not. Standing in front of the crease is also an issue when clearly the bowler or wicket keeper has the ball in their hand. But overall, I'd call myself a casual cricket fan (I mainly watch Tests) - I KNOW, people find that odd too lol. This is an excellent cricket game that really holds strong to core values of real life cricket. I'd go as far as to say that this is a cricket simulator, because the attention to detail of the batting is quite remarkable that puts other cricket games to shame.The Good:- Batting is a blast once you learn the techniques, the first 4-5 hours of gameplay I was absolutely hopeless getting 15 runs and out, you really need to learn the controls, (which overall isn't too difficult)]- Bowling is also one of my favourite features, I never thought I'd enjoy bowling as much, being a casual cricket fan, this put some perspective in the techniques that real life bowlers used and gave me some appreciation for what they do.- The Interace is intuitive and I personally feel it's better than Rugby League Live 3's.- The Academy is also a great feature.The Bad: - Fielding is overall O.K. Although I still feel like I need to manually be able to hit the wickets with maybe a Right Analogue Push or better known as the R3 Button on the playstation.- Commentary definitely needs an update in the next game, (It's not terrible but it just needs more chit chat and dialogue, with commentators talking to each other etc.- Graphics needed an overhaul, but since they're using the same game engine as Rugby League, I can't wait to see what the next game brings for us.The Ugly:- Always Online DRM (This is really Ugly, like fugly) -Tru Blu Entertainments price on steam is a f'ing joke, I bought the limited edition on EBAY which comes with a controller and I got it for $33 AUD with free shipping, on steam it's equivalent to $70 AUD.-Tru Blue EntertainmmentI'll rate this in 3 categories plus with an overall as a 'game' and a 'cricket game'.Graphics - 5/10Gameplay 7.5/10Audio/Interface 7/10Overall as a game 6.5/10Overall as a cricket game 8.5/10			"

												This is the best cricket game so far, great game considering it's 1st from Big Ant Studios.I have previously tried EA's 2002, 2004, 2005, 2007 and Codemaster's Brian Lara 2005, 2007 and Ashes Cricket 2009. And nothing came as close to cricket as this one. Probably EA's 2005 and Brian Lara 2007, Ashes Cricket 2009 were good, but this one just feels right.Graphics are not that impressive, but good enough. Some of the players downloaded online do really look-a-like.Stadiums are very few, also changing the casual match settings takes time, hope they make an easy menu for this next time.Commentary is good, funny, enjoyable.Gameplay is very fun, batting you can actually play shots in 360 degrees. I haven't quite got hang of bowling, especially spin, but even that feels good.There is even DRS system, quite fun to review umpire's decision and watch it.I got limited edition from local e-Tailer. It came with controller in the box, maybe not as good as XBox 360 one, but does feel good compared to sub-500 INR controllers I have used in past.

												8/10Probably the best cricket simulation the gaming world has seen. Though there are some flaws, the gameplay is rather good accompanied by hyperbolic commentators that make you laugh every once in a while owing to the absurdity of their comments with relevance to the shot you play or the ball you bowl.While players get to choose from a variety of shots when batting,  most of the shots do not look authentic onscreen and the batsmen run way too slow unless the players choose to sprint.While bowling is probably the highlight of the game, the much needed boost the game requires is an increased inventory of bowling actions.Out of all the aspects of the game, fielding is the closest to real life. Another important aspect to highlight is the extremely cartoonish appearance of cricketers.The game makers have evidently thrown their backs into making this game. The varied features, chaperoned by a few changes, will make this a game for the history books.			"

												The best cricket game out there.  I know that sounds like it's not hard seeing as there are so few out there but it really is well done.  Easy controls to get to grips with, there is perfect balance between it not being too hard too easy to peform bowling, batting or fielding.  So many other games made catches or bowling nearly impossible due to there being such a fine line between perfection or oblivion.   Also this game does not give you wickets left, right and centre.  You might Five-fors, you might get hat-tricks.  But they will be as often as the professionals get, you will get that stubborn batsman whom you try everything to get out and then boom a simple shot sends the bails flying and your arm raising in triumph.  One thing I hope for in the future is perhaps the addition of more stadiums, better commentary (it does get a little repetitive) and better designed character models (Jimmy Anderson looks like a caveman).

												This is by far the best cricket game ever made, this does not however mean that everything in the game is awesome. One thing I find very difficult in this game is the steep learning curve for batting and bowling. Bowling is probably a tad easier than batting since batting involves making all your decisions in mere seconds which includes footwork, line and length and direction all in 1 second. That being said does not necessarily mean that the batting is broken, on the contrary if your footwork, timing and shot selection is spot on you are in for something amazing. A lot of people do not understand why they find edges even after timing the ball perfectly and choosing the right shot selection, but they forget that the 3rd element in batting the direction of your feet when playing the shot. The only way to master the batting is time in the nets, and alot of it.Overall this game is by far the best cricket game, no cricket game before this come close and it is definately worth the money for cricket fans. Casual players will maybe get frustrated by the batting and bowling controls because of the complexity, but I love it, the game tends more to a simulation than being an arcade cricket game. You will not be hitting 6 sixes in one over that easily and when you achieve this you can actually be proud, since it is a feat.Gameply: 9Graphics: 7Sound: 7Final Score: 8I hope this helps, enjoy!

												I've been looking for a good cricket game on the PC for a long, long time and with Don Bradman Cricket 14 I initially thought I'd found it.The GoodBowling feels more natural than any other game I've played. Gone are target recticules that you place where you want the ball to land. In their place is a method that requires timing and finesse, and feels an awful lot more like you are actually bowling.Batting strokes are well implemented, with the full range available to you including fancy tricks such as reverse sweeps and ramp shots. Footwork is as important to batting as it is in real life too, and if you get this really wrong then it doesn't matter what stroke you choose, you'll still be in trouble.There are a wide variety of ways of playing the game, with all formats included. They've also got around the issue of not having any licenses by allowing you to automatically download the highest rated user mods, which quickly adds in the most important national and international teams and players. I was particularly pleased that they've included a Career mode, allowing you to take a single player all the way from local obscurity to international success.This all sounds great right? However, after a little while a few significant issues came to light that mean I just can't make a general recommendation, as much as I want to.The BadThere is a massive leap in difficulty between the Amateur and Professional skill levels when you're batting. To me, this is the biggie. At Amateur level I can easily score centuries with my wet behind the ears rookie without even trying. It's so forgiving, I don't really need to concentrate much on what I'm doing at all. Switch to the next difficulty up though, and there is an enormous difficulty spike, which try as I might I just can't get over.Don't get me wrong, I like that the game can be made that tough. Hell, I'd love to be in a position where I can work towards playing at Professional difficulty. Unfortunately, the grind and the way the game punishes you for even the slightest mistakes at that difficulty just saps any enjoyment I have, leaving me with no desire to continue banging my head against a brick wall. There has to be some way of easing you in, some kind of halfway house that helps you grow into it. I've spent hours in the nets and in practice matches, and the feedback it gives you is helpful, but you don't get that help once you step into an actual match that matters, and the small margin for error has often left me wondering what I did wrong that got my batsman out.Another gripe I have is the reliance on red, green and yellow to show whether a delivered ball is short, on a length or full. I know I'm in the minority here, but being partially colourblind makes this even harder. It's not bad enough that it is a deal breaker for me, but some other way of showing the difference, or even just being able to customise the colours would be really helpful.Then there's fielding. There are a few issues here. The first is that the game doesn't provide a fielding 'radar' when you're batting, and the only way of seeing how the opposition have set the field is by going to first person view and looking around. In general I love it when a dev is this committed to realism. The problem here is I think they've gone too far. Having to do this every single time you think they might have made a fielding change is a massive drag, and becomes a real pain.Another problem with this is the way they've implemented the camera for tracking the ball and helping you judge whether a run is on or not. A lot of the time it works, but I've lost count of when the camera angle chosen doesn't show me quickly enough for me to make a decision. In real life you'd be able to glance quickly and make a judgement, but this obviously isn't possible here. ConclusionsThis game is so frustratingly close to being amazing its ridiculous. If I wrote a checklist of all the things I want in a cricket game, this game meets almost all of them. Unfortunately, the few areas it falls short are so important, I just can't make a general recommendation.However, I can absolutely see there is a section of the market out there that would love this, If you have faster reactions than me and/or a greater tolerance for the grind it takes to make the leap in difficulty the game presents, then go ahead and have a blast.

												Wow, finally a cricket game worth playing!!!A couple of days in and I've created a couple of players and am enjoying taking them through their first season.  In my first match I spent 30 overs fielding at deep backward square leg and took a screamer of a catch before I worked out there is a menu option to simulate to your players next involvement either with the bat or the ball.The leg spinning all-rounder is challenging having bowled a few overs to reset myself and concentrate on batting as the next task although the bowling mechanics are fun and challenging at the same time.  The specialist batsman is great to play a few shots with, but I am struggling to keep my concentration, particularly if I've managed to get onto a couple of early boundaries (the same issue I had in real life)!My highlights after approx 15 hours?  Taking a 5 wicket haul for SA against Tassie and the 50 I scored for Derbyshire with my young opener off 13 balls!The only gripes I have with the game are the commentary being inserted at random as about 1/2 the time it doesnt make sense (so I've taken to playing music at the same time) and the grounds...I've had an English County game and SA v Tas at the MCG!  These are small issues though when compared to the important part of a cricket game...do the mechanics feel engaging, fluid and as though you are controlling your player...in short, yes!This game is fun to play and being a cricket game has enough stats to keep a cricket fan entertained.  Do I like my batting average being just under 30? No; will I keep playing to improve it? Yes!That is what this genre has been missing since Shane Warne/Brian Lara's cricket in the late 90s...a game worth playing!			"

One Word: AWESOMEWell, I'll be quiet simple. If you simply love the sport cricket, and you consider yourself as a gamer, I strongly recommend you this game. You just can't resist buying it, I know the price is a whopping 44$, but I personally say, it's worth it.Graphics: 9/10. Way ahead than other cricket games ever made.Features: 10/10. Tons of unique features are there in the game, which is my main reason of buying this game.Online: Yes. This game can be played online. You can play tournaments, create tourneys, play with your mates, play quick match with others... damn so good.Fake names? Kits? Faces? Well, say bye bye to that also. You can download teams, players, umpires, kits.. literally everything. And obviously you can create one yourself too. You can simply download the most popular ones in one click to get the realistic roster at a single click.Damn man, I just realised I wasted too much time on writing this review, let me enjoy the game - and I hope you too. Haha.			"

THE PROS:There are a few problems I have with this game, but this is still the best Cricket game available on the market today. The controls are fluid and responsive for both batting and bowling, the graphics are very nice and getting a good score feels genuinely rewarding. The upper difficulty levels are brutal, but not impossible. With recent patches, nicks carrying behind have become far more common which makes fast bowling as a career player much more relevant and the ability to skip to your turn while batting means you are no longer forced to call for runs as the non-striker when you can't see where the ball went. These are all excellent changes. THE CONS:Anyone who's played a FIFA game before is familiar with the concept of rubber-banding and this game can really take it to the extreme. If the game decides you're out, you're out and if a fielder has to break the sound barrier running from square leg to take a catch on the boundary at deep long off to make that happen, then so be it. If your team is going to lose, it's going to lose and if the number 10 batsman on the team has to hit 300 off 90 balls to make that happen, then it's going to happen. It can be interesting, at least, to see all the ways the game can come up with to shaft you.			"

												Simply put, the best cricket game of this generation (and the previous one combined).You need a gamepad (preferably an Xbox 360 controller) to play the game on your PC due to the nature of the controls. You need an analog stick to accuractely place your shots. A keyboard just will NOT work.Once you get hang of the controls, ball physics and other awesome mechanics of this game, you will truly fall in love with it.There are definitely issues with a few jerky animations here and there and a little boring and monotonous commentary, the great gameplay easily makes up for these issues.Pros:- Great gameplay for a Cricket game, easily the best of this and the last generation combined.- Detailed controls. Easy enough to start hitting boundaries and sixers but really hard to master.- Great replays, DRS (Decision Review System), ball mechanics and other fun stuff including lots and lots of statistics.- Online Multiplayer mode with the ability to save games to continue later (You can play full Test matches with your friends).- Lots and lots of very realistic looking players and and team uniforms.- Many game modes including a Career mode, tournaments, competitions and casual play.- Great comfortable camera angles to choose from.- Did I say you can field manually?- Full ability to make changes to teams and players through the Don Bradman Academy. Now play your favorite historical cricket players!- The most realistic and fun cricket game for many years now.Middleground:- Steep learning curve.- Could do with a field mini-map during balling and batting.- Decent graphics and audio (excluding commentary).- Requires an Xbox 360 controller for Windows.- Not a great teacher for those new to Cricketing rules etc. (Not an issue for cricket lovers)Cons:- Twitchy animations sometimes.- Due to the complex nature of the game, there are some bugs and issues which should hopefully be ironed out quickly. As of this review, such issues are few and dont really bother too much.- Commentary can get boring fast.- Lack of ""Voice Chat / Typing Chat"" during multiplayer matches. You have to use Steam, TeamSpeak, etc. for it.If you are a cricket lover and own a gamepad to play this with, get Don Bradman Cricket 14 now! And if you don't own a gamepad, still get this game and buy an Xbox 360 controller ASAP!Now I am done selling this, go and get it!Edit: Made a few changes to the Pros and Cons list.			"

												If you have any interest at all in cricket - get this game.You'll definitely have an advantage coming to grips with the mechanics if you have an understanding of cricket (what shots to play to different deliveries, etc), and the learning curve is a little stiff, but that's exactly how it should be, cricket is a game of fine margins.The PC version is patched regularly, and the devs are very responsive. Couldn't recommend this any more highly.			"

It takes some getting used to at first as the controls really are unlike any other cricket game - after a whie it is really rewarding tho. I spent ages just on the character creation screen.

So much detail into the smaller things that matter and a fresh new way to play. 9.8 out 10 Its a master of cricket games, deserves hall of fame . Im glad to see you can play old teams and not just current ones it even brings a career mode where you star as young rising star. This game deserves every penny it asks for, i say this because if the people behind this game continue down this path there are some very exciting times down the line.			"

												I have to say i was skeptical all the way throughout the game's development. I ignored trying it out on console as i prefer gaming on the pc (and their version of AFL Live was a far better experience on pc than on console so i figured i would not double dip in this instance). In a nutshell you have to forget about how you played cricket games in the past, now you really have to concentrate and work for your runs when batting. Bowling is a little more simple, but i assume on higher difficulty levels there will be a bigger challenge when bowling. The graphics are a bit hard to get used to at first, depending on the weather..... things REALLY stand out on a nice fine sunny day but on overcast days the graphics are not as nice. It's a cricket game after all and the only thing that really matters i the action on the pitch, and that is very detailed. I encourage anyone that is a cricket fan to buy this, you will enjoy it. I encourage any American that is curious about the game to try it out as well.In conclusion i will say that this is the best cricket game i have played since Shane Warne Cricket '99 on playstation and pc.

												I have played pretty much every cricket game on a console or PC since NES. This is by miles the best cricket game ever. I also have Rugby league live 3 and have to say Big Ant are great at making sports sims. Both games are incredible.Takes some time to get good at, and you build up a range of skills as you go (some can be built up just playing in the nets). As skills get stronger (i.e Front foot strokes) your success rate with these moves will improve.One thing to watch out for that caught me, and the only thing i didnt like that happened, is i chose to be a high order batsman in my career, with no bowling skills, and every now and then in a random 50 over match, the captain will bowl me. First time it happened i didnt even know what buttons to use lol, i hadnt practiced. And you cant skip your spell, only the overs between yours. So id familiarise yourself with the bowling basics for that odd occurence. So far its happened twice in about 25 one day matches. Hasnt happened in any other match type.Awesome cricket game, which you should get an XBox controller for, to fully experience it properly. Using the sticks to bat is the best ever, and most realistic batting contol i have experienced, once you get used to it. I recommend time in the nets, it builds skills and also helps you learn timing and how to use the controls. Make sure you change the bowling machine to throw you some spin bowling too. That is the hardest thing to deal with for new players. I have cruised to 50 against fast bowlers, only to get out first ball to a spinner when he came on. More than once.Highly recommended and i will probably buy DBC 17 too, after its had a major patch or 2. At this time DBC 14 is more polished. I have played DBC 17 on a friends console, and it needs work, but looks promising. It took them some time to get this game right too, and on release it was full of bugs. And the PC version is better with most games too. Im glad they kept patching this game to the point its at now, and thats stable and awesome.			"

												I would like to rate this game a solid 8/10. This game is very much a very good cricket game and has by far surpassed anything that I have experienced before this game. Having saying that, more changes such as catching assists and more boundary catches would rate this game higher. Also the issues that require fixing are the spinners that are done with controllers. One final change I would also like to state would be to fix the uploading servers as I have had issues with trying to log in and not being able to despite having the same username and password that was previously saved and working onto the log in servers. DBC14 was a revolutionary game and as you can see with the number of hours I have put into this game, it has very much not disappointed.

												This is unquestionably miles better than any other cricket game to date. Its control scheme just makes sense, its realisation of the game's laws is detailed and faithful and its physics engine finally allows for satisfying edges. There are a few little details which reveal the small budget available in the development in this game, most pertinently the poor animation of the crowds, and a few bugs, the most obvious of which have already been patched, but they cannot stop this game from being just miles ahead of all other efforts in this space.If you are a cricket fan, buy this game. It's that simple. If you're not, you're probably not going to enjoy it. The detail and difficulty of the game (very reflective of the actual game of cricket itself) will appeal to cricket fans and make others absolutely despise the game, if I'm a good judge of human nature.

												Definately the best cricket game ever (not counting the International Cricket Captain management games, but this probably beats them too). Great career mode where you create player and take control exclusively of him, rather than the whole team. Really nice player and team editor too, and the community creations means it's not a big deal that the game lacks licenses. You can just download pretty good representations from any team you can think of from the cricket academy.			"

												Easily the best cricket game ever made.The learning curve can be steep but the rewards are there if you put in the time and effort.It can be a bit fiddly to start with as the controls are nothing like any cricket game ever made, so persevere and you'll be rewarded.For every wicket you take there is a sense of pride, just like when you score some runs.For me I've found the batting to be the hardest part, whereas bowling is tough but like I said rewarding.This game is well worth your time and effort.

This game has got a huge community which is still active, you can download squads you can upload your own team, this game is simply perfect. The only con being there is no World Cup/Series in the Career mode, yes there are different T20 cups, but still a WORLD CUP IS A WORLD CUP >_< .Edit - The multiplayer feature is no good now, would take ages to find someone to play with. Won't recommend it on full price.			"

												Without much time invested in the game so far I can already tell that this is going to be a firm favourite of mine for some time to come.I am a big cricket fan and an equally big video game fan. I have been playing cricket games for as long as I can remember from Graham Gooch's cricket on the C64, Super International cricket on the SNES, most of the thoroughly excellent Brian Lara games, the complex cricket captain series, the hit and miss quality of the EA series and more recently the frustrating codemasters releases and Cricket Revolution. This game very clearly sets a new benchmark for cricket games.The batting system is joyus. The game rewards you for reactions and punishes you for playing premeditated shots. You are forced to consider the implications of working the ball around the pitch for long term accumulation or pinch hitting for quick runs and the bowlers adapt to your style of batting and actively try and out think you.Bowling is a great improvement on previous games where instead of selecting a spot on the pitch to hit, you focus on line and length and take wickets through variation and guile. Bowling the same ball over and over again is, like real cricket, an invitation for the batsman to score where as subtle variations on pace, spin/swing and bowling position as well as bowling to a plan gives wickets in a similar way to real life.This game is highly polished in particular the in game implementation of the DRS system and the availability of reviews is fantastic. Graphics are clean and crisp although not without the occasional error or glitch. I have not encountered anything game breaking personally.The career mode is probably where I will spend most of my time. In a similar way to the 'be a pro' mode in Fifa games you start as a green and eager 16 year old and work your way through your local team through to the international arena honing and developing your skills along the way. Another major positive for me is the ability to mod the game with real player and team likenesses and the continued support by the developer to patch in functional and bug improvements. Currently the co-op mode is missing but this is to be patched in at a later time. I appreciate the effort to get the game to the market and it clearly has been designed and developed by people who love the game. Once co-op mode has been release I can see this becoming a very popular feature.In short, if you are a cricket fan and you are sitting on the fence about this game then I can assure you there is enough here to keep you entertained. It plays more like cricket than any other game I have played. If you need me, I'll be in the nets.			"

												Premium price for a substandard product. The editors in the game are quite powerful and featured but that's let down by the other aspects of the game. Graphics quality from the stadium models to the actual textures are anywhere from average to extremely poor. The lack of resolution options for UHD and wide screen users is disheartening (max res is 2560x1440). The menu is cumbersome to say the least and the actual game controls end up being a chore and take away any fun that is left in the game.			"

												Ok the graphics are good but not the best I have ever seen. Community support for current national/State/County/etc teams is fantastic. Even up-to-date umpires can be downloaded!Some things I love about this game:-Net practise actually relates to matchplay (unlike most cricket games).-Every over is NOT a 16-24 run over.-You are actually rewarded experience-wise to play three defensive shots an over, and playing yourself in (gaining confidence) makes batting easier later.-Weather & pitch condition matter. You WILL run out of time in some 4-day and test matches.-Bowling does seem a little too easy at the moment, however, I have only been playing on easier settings so far.-The orthodox cricket shots for a specific ball get you the best results over time.-Has some small things that need tweaking but....this is easily the Best Cricket game I have ever played!

												While there's still a lot to be desired, this is easily the best cricket game available. Batting and bowling are great fun and tactical approaches to either seem to be rewarding. Fielding is a bore in career mode, but easily simmed past. I have plenty of questions about the accuracy of unsuccessful LBWs, playing both as bowler and batsman, and AI fielders have a habit of making you throw your arms in the air, but such is AI in sport games.If you are looking for a cricket game just get this. Don't look at other games, just get this. But be aware that while it is the best cricket game available, it is not the best game available.			"

												The playstyle of this game is nice. Overall easily the best cricket game that I've come across. It's fun batting and bowling, which has seemingly been a tough task in most cricket games (lol). Although I don't quite understand any overarching batting strategy existing in the game, i.e. unsure if you can demoralize the bowler... (there could be mechancs like that, could not tell), it's fun dealing with each delivery for its merits since the controls are well designed. The bowling is more difficult to master, but I felt effectiveness in employing an overall strategy rather than just trying for a wicket every ball. That feels like quite a feat for a cricket game since in other games there's usually a sweet spot or a common strategy to rinse-repeat. Didn't feel like that in this game. That said, I'm not quite convinced by the spin bowling in this game. Hurts my thumbs.I feel the statistics element of the game could be improved. Cause effect between games played and statistics (outside of career mode) should be clearer. And the career mode could have tournaments in it - would make sense to me. Also why can't a batting alrounder open the batting? :)Overall I have fun playing this game. Can play, watch some TV, chill out. Was rather addictive to get my first character into all the international teams, and as captain.			"

												I honestly can't praise this game enough. If you like cricket (and let's face it, what right thinking person doesn't) this is a must. Vast amount of options and game types with an excellent career mode. This is a great base to build an ongoing franchise around and Big Ant Studios provide after-sales support that is beyond anything that I've seen for any other title. The only thing that is missing is the option to replace the title music with Soul Limbo by Booker T & The MG's.Just a quick update...over two years later and over 900 hours of game time...it is still a great game and I am still playing it. It will not be surpassed until DBC17 is released.			"

In order to score runs, you've got to apply yourself.Also one could play all the possible shots in the cricketing notebook.Edges are very realistic which was never done before in any game.Fast bowling is a real charm with all the subtle variations possible.

For possibly the first time my gaming life that my hope has not been in vain. This is a great cricket game, albiet with it's fair share of problems. The problems I have encountered aren't game breaking but they do annoy me from time to time. The commentary is very bad, unhelpful, and generally uninformative. Thankfully it isn't in the background all the time.I'd also like to see more indepth stats for my career player and also on the game scorecard. Why is there no separate bowling card?Thanks Big Ant.

												Best Cricket game ever. I have played almost every cricket game since the early 90s. For a cricket fanatic, it's a complete pacakage. The developers have put a lot of effort and each aspect of the game seems perfect. Whether playability, mechanics, shot selection, reality or setbacks, you will be amazed by the detail of work put into. Never had a cricket game been designed with such authentic mechanics. For example, consider the EA cricket series, there was no excitement and reality except than cricket 1997, which I often play with my friends on a 3gb graphic card and core i7!The best thing is the career mode!

												The most enjoyable cricket game I've ever played - it's certainly not perfect, but it's definitely good enough that you can put up with it's little foibles and still have a great game.The controls are much more realistic and it is a lot harder to play and be good at than before.  This makes it a lot more challenging.  Don't expect to be any good at this straight away - it will require practice.  For anyone being put off by the requirement of a controller, don't be.  It really is necessary, there's no way you'd be able to do this with a mouse and keyboard.  It's more of a cricket simulator than an arcade style gameThe graphics aren't great, but they're better than other cricket games.  At least the players look real and not like someone who's been involved in a nasty industrial accident.  The commentary is somewhat irritating, but the same can be said of almost all commentary in any sports games.  Once you've heard it a few times, it doesn't really change.I'm running this on a mid 2011 iMac running Bootcamp and it runs pretty well.  The only difference from stock is a RAM upgrade to 16GB.  I've got the settings turned down a bit and the frame rate is reasonable.  T`his was my only option to play this as I don't have a 360 or PS3 and I was happy enough to shell out for a copy of Windows first and then buy the game and still not feel ripped off.If you're a cricket fan, then I'd put this down as an essential purchase			"

												This is definitely the best cricket game in a very, very long time. The community is friendly and are exceedingly active with providing new bats, full updated teams, kit, team badges, etc. Extremely immersive with a very well put together career mode that will keep you busy for hours while you play through the 20 year (from age 16 to 36) career, you can of course start later in the career if you want a shorter one.Online play is fun and challenging with tourneys being run by some people. The batting will take a lot of getting used to, but with the practice nets, practice match functions and a bunch of patience you can quickly get into it and start scoring runs.Xbox controllers are definitely recommended as some others that I've tried do not give you the full range of control with the right thumb stick and cuts down what you can and can't do in the game.Overall I love this game and play it as much as I can, and I definitely recommend it to any friend/family member/acquantance that's looking for a solid cricket game.8/10 (only because there's a couple issues, but the devs are active on the forums at Planet Cricket and are working on it)			"

												A cricket game afer almost 5 years - and what a materpiece it has turned out to be. All the pros and cons have been adequetely listed by others so I'm not gonna repeat the same things again.BA Studious have got 90% of the aspects right in their first iteration itself and that speaks volumes of the effort the team has put in. I have no doubt in my mind that in the coming years, if the franchise manages to do well it will easily overtake/threaten the big brands in the market. I can only wish that the PC platform will be supported when that happens.			"

												First cricket game which plays and runs like the real thing. There is a great ballance of skill required to be good at this game however if you want to score heavy you still can. If you enjoy and undertand cricket then this is a cert to get, if you play cricket then dont even think twice.			"

												The best cricket game ever made. Difficult to master and one truly for the cricket fanatic. If BLIC 2005 was the hit and giggle, slap and tickle t20 of the cricket gaming arena, then this is test cricket. The bowling and batting controls are new and logical, whilst nice touches like the DRS system make it a well put together package. Scoring rates are realistic (don't expect to go pasting bowlers all over the place from the off) and sensible bowling is often rewarded.  The lack of players is made up for by a set up that allows for a mod community to make up for this, who have already made custom umpires (so far there are very good Steve Bucknors and Dickie Bird but no David Shepherd yet...). The terrible commentary (simple crowd noises would have suited me to be honest) and less good fielding are things you can live with. It's such a shame we've had to wait until 2014 to wait for a worthy successor to Brian Lara Cricket 96 on the Mega Drive...			"

												It's been a while since I've played a cricket game. A lot of them just looke like a re-hashing of a previous version...but finally we get something a little different.The controls are probably the biggest thing about this game. It gives a more natural feel to the game, almost like you are actually out there. But they aren't clumsy as they are in other games (FIFA for instance), and there's definitely room for error when using the tiny thumbsticks.The immersion of being in pro camera mode and batting in the middle is like nothing I've felt in any sports game. Taking penalties in FIFA is probably the closest I've gotten to the nervousness and sweaty palm-ness of facing a fast bowler late on day 5 trying to save a game in DBC14. It's like real life!The moddability of the game is a plus and the developers clearly haven't left PC gamers by the wayside like we've seen with so many other sports games.Having said all that, the game is not perfect. What sports game is? There are some weird animations and typical situations which are unrealistic. The game has some annoying bugs like playing all five tests in a series at one ground, or players not running after the ball when fielding, and the constant hitting of stumps when throwing the ball to the keeper or bowler, or the keeper getting stuck on the stumps...ugh. The selection of players in career mode is stuck on whatever the default line up was and never seems to change which can be frustrating, also you are stuck on your batting position for your whole career. I'm sure I could keep going on about what could be improved, but at the end of the day this is a solid game from a local Aussie company, and they've done an admirable job. Definitely worth it if you like cricket games. Possibly worth it if you just like sports and are curious about cricket.			"

												One of the most complete cricket games of all time. I have played all the cricket games which have been released before, but this game has all the qualities that a cricket game should have, the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is smooth, the umpire decisions are accurate and the new DRS feature in the game which is known  as BARS is the most innovative thing added in a cricket game, this feature was never added before in any other cricket game and was also meant to be impossible to add it, but hats off to the developers Big Ant Studios, they have done a wonderful job, the only cons for this game is that you get occassional lag spikes and stutters and it is also hard to find internet games, other than that it is a beautiful game and if you're a fan of cricket and wanna buy a cricket game, I would definitely recommend this game hands down.

												Best Cricket Game to Date -- 10/10This game wouldn't be what it is if it hadn't been for the tremendous support from the Big Ant Studios. It's been almost 2 years since the release but thanks to continuous support by Big Ant Studios, Don Bradman Cricket hasn't become boring/cliched. In terms of gameplay, this game won't get old anytime soon but the graphics have started to give the feeling of being outdate but nonetheless I'd say it's still good for another year. I've been playing this game since the release date and I've seen it evolve. It has become the best cricket video game to date. If you think about this game as just a sports simulation, it really is an achievement. We've never seen any Cricket game with such realism and elaborate gameplay mechanics before.I can't give enough credit to BIG Ant Studios for coming through with such elaborate and sophisticated Cricket game despite knowing the fact that Cricket Video Games doesn't have much market.I'd strongly recommend this game to every Cricket fan.

												The best Cricket game out there! Made by fans, for the fans. Big Ant has really put a lot of effort to bring this game out.There were days when I was hoping and praying that EA would put out a new game. After 2007, EA abandoned the franchise, Codemasters tried their hands on it once in a while. But, Cricket was a dead game, almost the entire community resorted to ""mods"", Cricket 07 was modded to great extent to make it playable (enjoyable), Patches to fix AI, toughen bowling, make strokes close to realistic and stuff, but nothing gave the satisfaction of a complete game.DBC14 arrived at the scene and took it by storm, the price was high (considering I live in India, where this was close to 4k of our currency). I had second thoughts, but then I looked up the trailers, put faith in the developers and bought it.Despite the high price of the game, which is really needed for the developers to set up a base for future titles, the game is complete. Complete in every way, except for commentary. Pros-* CAREER MODE!* Great bowling controls* Great batting controls* Great fielding controls* Great everything* BIG head mode Cons-* Commentary is kinda dull* Not many players to meet in Multiplayer mode.Go ahead and buy it, you will not regret the decision.

Not Recommended Because...Each time you play, this game demands you ""prove to us you're not a dirty thief"".Requires internet connection to play even for single player. This form of DRM has no place on Steam and should be voted down. It's a misguided attempt at preventing piracy, but what it means is that Steam members are treated as ""guilty until proven innocent"" every time they start the game.Obviously this rules out ""flight mode"" gaming or when you don't have a connection. If you have a gaming laptop, sometimes you find yourself in places without a connection. But more than that, the principle of ""checking in"" with the game's uptight DRM system to prove you have a verified copy, is a pathetic insult. Most games on Steam DO NOT do this. Even big games like GTAV allow offline mode. They only require the internet when the game releases an update. As a further insult, this game was originally released without the mandatory online check.. then in the next update they slipped it in as a ""feature"". Rude.Don't buy this game, it's not very good anyway. Clunky mechanics, and they're hitching a ride on Bradman's name in a shameless cash-in attempt.			"

												Certainly not a bad game by any stretch, Sim styled Cricket is something that hasn't been done well hell we've hadn't had a decent Cricket game since the PS2/Xbox days and that's saying a lot. Although it is decent, I do have a few issues nothing major but issues nonetheless that I feel should Big Ant address them it make the new release a lot better.Lack of customization in career.For me any sports game that allows you to put yourself in the game has to really pull out the stops for it to feel like a representation of yourself and have it as you want it and while it's not bad, not having any options to change bowling actions or having a preferred style of batting whether you're more into wristy flicks and a batsman who is looking to time to ball instead of someone who is a brute and is looking to put a lot of power into the stroke. I think BAS missed a great opportunity to make the career mode one of the highlights but as it happens it's just lacking thus far.Batting.While for the most part, batting is generally okay I feel there is not a lot of variety in shot animations. Very seldom you will see a batsman go full blooded and extend the stroke for say a straight drive or a on drive as you see in game, for the most part they will generallly push the ball back down the ground and allow the timing to get the runs.Also why no normal advancing shots? Seems strange you can't use your feet to work a ball into the gap instead of trying to launch it out of the ground.Bowling.Much like batting, bowling is in general done very well, can't argue with the variation given, although it's a little irritating that left handed bowlers stats are coded incorrectly Eg: When making a left arm pacer, in order to have a good outswinger from the left hander you have to set the best delivery to ""In Swinger"" perhaps a little nit picky but still, it shouldn't happen.Fielding and AIProbably the weakest area for me. Well struck shots that are next to fielders just result in them standing still then diving too late to get the ball and that's rather frustrating to watch.Catching animations are also a little odd especially when the wicketkeeper is catching edges istead of just taking a regulation catch they will turn their back towards the ball and somehow just dive on it but catch it nonetheless although funny I don't think we would see MS Dhoni do that :PBowling against AI feels kind of frustrating at times, they seem to have a real tendency to sweep the spinners a lot even to balls pitched outside off stump and there isn't much penalty for it, not had them top edge or anything like that.Even against pace bowlers, bowling on a good length swinging away from off stump or even just bowling seam up outside the off stump they will just fly swat it away to the leg side without much thought yet when I try it, of course I conveniently edge it straight to the slips. A little frustrating in truth.Besides what I've said, It's honestly not a bad game if you're after a decent sim style Cricket game, It really has a lot of potential should BAS make further iterations and I certainly hope they do.

												DBC 14 is far from a perfect cricket game, but it's definitely a step in the right direction for cricket video games. It might not rival the likes of FIFA, but for a sports game, it certainly does do the job. There are still many things which will need to be improved should there be a sequal to this game however, so if you're considering buying this game make sure you have a look at the parts of the game which aren't quite as well put together as the other parts.

												Whoa! Thats not how I expected a video game cricket would be.. This game is too realistic both in terms of graphics and gameplay. This is not an arcade cricket game like brianlara cricket or any other games.. Unique game simply incorporating all the skills of real cricket. Arcade players may not like this, but real cricket lovers must buy this game. Remember your pace, jump timings, swing input all matters how the ball will land [REALISTIC PHYSICS].. And this game is not a game which shows a bowler marker where the ball will land. It has everything the career, community created players, running clubs, tournaments and much more. (The reason why I have a low playing time in my profile is because you must be online to get into the game everytime. And I still have a cracked version of this game to play it offline.

												As a cricket fan I have played the game for real, seen it at the top grounds in my home country, and bought various incarnations of it on the numerous consoles I have owned. When I saw this game, while browsing through the game store, my interest was peaked. I had been looking for a worthy successor to 'Brian Lara Cricket' - a great game in it's own right - and this seemed to fit the bill. I was a little hesitant about the cost, but after reading the reviews I took the plunge.I have rarely enjoyed my first couple of hours playing a game as much as I did this one. Graphically - brilliant! Atmospherically - it's like being there. The controls are instinctive, and the ball moves dynamically depending on how the bat connects with it - as it should. I still haven't mastered the field settings but the day, as they say, is yet young. Another aspect that surprised me was the depth of history that the team choices can offer. We all have our sporting heroes and to be able to pick a team with them in it is great - even from some time ago.All-in-all, I would highly recommend this game to all cricket fans. It is so good you can almost smell the grass. Play!			"

												Put simply, Don Bradman is a fantastic cricket game, the best one I've played since Cricket 07. (And Aussie made!)What it lacks in graphics and repetitive commentary  is made up for by a deep batting and bowling system, alongside the community mods that allow real teams to be seamlessly incorporated. Career mode is basic, and you never get moved up or down the order, but hopefully will be fixed in DBC17!If you love cricket, buy this game.			"

												If you are a cricket fanatic, then yes buy away. Otherwise this game is a bit of a drag.Whilst the gameplay mechanics are solid, with the notable exception of fielding being bloody awful, the game has some wierd design decisions.A lot of information is withheld from you without, who's batting? what bowler are you facing? are they left arm fast, medium, slow? What condition is the pitch in? What condition is the ball in? Where are the fielders? Has the career AI captain changed my fielding set up again? (yes, yes he has) Whats the weather for the second day look like? Did my bouncer into the ribs of the batsman do anyting to unnerve them? Is it worthwhile? Should I run after hitting the ball? I don't know because the camera isn't facing the ball yet.These are questions that you have answered in near any other cricket game. There's no point playing a career game as a bowler if you have no way of knowing what condition the pitch or ball is in, let alone that your fielding setups will occasionally change without your knowledge (minimaps guys comeon).Some of the above info is accessible, but through many different menus rather than whilst playing it which slows an already slow game down - Except ball and pitch condition, you just have to figure out if the ball will swing or not...Career mode is a great idea, so so much potential, but the constant loading screens and lack of information about what is happening - plus the fact that a 16 year old is just thrown into first team matches against much better players - make it so frustrating.Great potential to be an amazing representation of cricket.. But so many odd design choices.			"

												TL;DR – Great cricket game, poor 2014-15 sports sim title, especially when considering the price.This is without doubt the best cricket game ever made. I have played all the EA and many Codemasters offerings from the 90s through to '11 when the last Codemasters game came out.However, baring that in mind I cannot recommend this game. This is based on a variety of factors and especially the price. This game, as far as I am aware, has never been on sale and has stayed at £35 or $50. For that amount of money you can buy far superior sports titles that are less likely to crash, do not require an internet connection whenever you launch it and look and play better. This game has complicated controls, that aren't easy to pick up because the tutorials (last time I played) haven't been updated. The sound is just terrible, between dull and repetitive commentary (although those that like cricket might say that it is quite spot on) and poor on the field sounds I usually turn the volume off and listen to a podcast.Furthermore, the game crashes way too much. In the past two weeks there have been a rush of patches after 6 months of silence. They made some nice changes but the whole game has been too unstable. This is especially the case considering I am not on any kind of beta channel and there is no option to only get major patches rather than the smaller ones the studio has been putting out.The biggest issue, however, is that (based on my last playthrough) the game is NOT an accurate simulation. Between bowlers consistently bowling down leg and batsmen playing at nothing down off this is not cricket. Because it fails at its main task it is difficult to recommend the game. When including the other issues and price it is impossible, in my opinion, to give this game a passing grade. "

												Don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic game. I've put a lot of hours into it and I've enjoyed nearly all of them. However, I have a couple of friends who also play it, and we were looking forward to playing 2v1 online when it was announced. At no stage was it mentioned that only 2 machines could connect to a session, and as we have no way of any of us being on the same machine we can't. I understand that there's limitations on bandwidth that come with 2v2 but to only say that 2v2 online is being introduced without any mention of only 2 machines being able to connect is pretty poor in my opinion. We were also trying to get another friend to purchase it with the intention of playing 2v2, and we're glad that we tried it before hand otherwise he would have spent a lot of money on a misunderstanding.

												Absolutely no indication of where fielders are when batting which ruins the best part of this game - the analog controls for batting.It's an astonishing ommision that makes what would otherwise be an admirable first attempt at a cricketing simulator something totally forgettable.What's even more astonishing is the price they are asking for the latest version of the game (nearly NZ120 dollars on XBox), when the game doesn't appear to have licensed (international) teams.I can't even recommend a purchase at it's current price of 59.99 NZD on Steam when there are:1) BETTER Cricket games that cost less AND2) A REAL cricket set for the home is gonna cost around 30 bucks.Avoid this game if you value your money.

												This game has so much potential but is seriously let down by the most comedy of errors.The game advertises a ""2v2"" concept giving the implications that you'll be able to have a 4 player match mode, however upon discovery it turns out that its 2v2 on the same computer. So instead of 4 machines playing its 2 controllers off 2 machines.Sub-par graphics Awful commentaryMediocre gameplay mechanicsHonestly it's typical budget cutting from an australian developer.Wouldn't reccommend.

I am a real life Cricket coach and I am thinking of using this game as a tool to develop a ""feel"" for the game.Prior knowledge of Cricket will help you to develop and ""grow"" quicker to higher levels but you can still begin as a novice and grow into it. It will take a lot of dedication though. DBC is a challenge, not for sissy boys. It give you a real feeling of real Cricket. Thank You DBC Boys.			"

												Probably the best PC cricket game I have ever played over the past 30+ years of playiing cricket games. Has everything and more a cricket fan could possible want. Stats galore, customization galore, creating your own players, team, comps, etc. Runs perfectly with controllers in big picture mode. Bit of a learning curve to get the hang of it, the more you play the better you will get at it. Great fun coop play in bigpicture mode on a big tv with wireless controllers.Not much else you could ask for from a cricket game. The commentary is good and not annoying. Fielding is alright, but still getting use to it. If you going to buy a cricket game, this is the one to buy. Bowling takes a while to get use to and still getting use to it, but getting better. No regrets even for the price. Worth every penny. Can't wait till i really sink my teeth into playing the game when i have time.			"

												Awesome game with regular update support from one of the best developers.Please do add an option of choosing between easy stroke play mode OR realistic stroke play.I am getting irritated on how each and every update, either makes the stroke play easy at the rookie level or realistic on the other patch.Many a times I play this game just to relax and would love to get an option of easier stroke play on rookie level forever untill I myself change to option to either a higher difficulty level or the realistic stroke play option.Was playing a match,and was hitting all over the park,saved the game,shut off the pc,next day woke up,only to see a new update downloading to play the game,and this time,the same strokes leads not even out of the inner circle with even a little bit of misstiming.I would happy accept the realistic gameplay on certain occassions and do appreciate the efforts that you put in,But no in a mood when I want to relax playing the game.Since the career of dbc14 is my one stop relaxation game since its release.

												bought this game from the developers site and installed through steam to sasve a bit of money. I was sceptical about paying £35 for it at first hense why i went to the devlper for half price. but i shouldn't have been scepical the game is brilliant. The use of the controler means you have almost full control where the ball is going both as the batter and bowler. The one thing which stands out for me on this is the fact you play as a player not the whole team. this might put some people off the in game carer mode but for me it just adds an extra sense of realism to the game making you think before every shot. Would recomend this to anyone who is looking at it			"

												This is the best ever Cricket Game developed till date. Right from the word GO, this gives the player an excellent experience. The best/lates inclusion in this game is the Career Mode which immerse you completely. Batting is amazing and bowling makes you feel truly a world class bowler. Needs too much concentration to play.			"

												excellent cricket game, and one definitely for fans of the sport, if you've played the game or an avid fan, you won't find it all that difficult to pick up, if you haven't then you better be ready to learn as this has one hell of a steep learning curve. but once you've learned how to crack play it becomes an extremely fun game. my two complaints would be spin bowling is a little buggy depending on what controller you use, i can never get it past half way on spin, and the aspect ratio of a non standard screen doesn't seem to work			"

												This is one of the nicest cricket game to come out in a while. The twin stick shot making is way better than choose-a-shot method of EA games. Bowling is also more fun than press-a-button. Especially since Spin and fast bowling uses different controls. I do wish they had the option for field radar. It does get annoying to keep looking through first person before every delivery since there really isn't any indication if there was a change in field placement. Also I really wish they would come out with a newer version of this game since it is now over two years old.			"

												Excellent game, and without a doubt the best cricket game ever made. Big Ant have obviously put their heart and soul into this game and it has payed off. The fielders may do some funky/glitchy movement at times, but nothing that disadvantages you and takes away from the game at all. Batting feels authentic and has a real learning curve if you are a cricket game veteran, bowling is well made although feels boring at times (but that may just be me). The career mode is by far the standout though. If you enjoy cricket, and enjoy gaming, definitely pick this one up. If you don't have a real interest in cricket, probably give it a miss.			"

Yes, this is very probably the finest cricket game ever made - though that's not really saying very much.

												Firstly, kudos to Big Ant Studios for developing what is undoubtedly the finest cricket game to date.For those of you who love cricket and have an appreciation for the nuances of the game, then I would highly recommend this title.  Although there are a couple of issues which have made the game less enjoyable for me recently, on balance it is an excellent cricket simulator and Big Ant are a worthy studio who should be encouraged to continue their fine work - although this game is not perfect, my advice to the diehard cricket tragics is that Big Ant represents the best chance we will get to cricket perfection in the future.  I sincerely hope they continue developing cricket games in future years.Firstly, the positives.Cricket is a very difficult and complex game in real life, and Don Bradman 14 has replicated this complexity in both batting and bowling.  Especially on the higher difficulty levels, concentration and timing are critical.  In batting, there is an excellent risk vs reward mechanism - it is possible to adopt a ""death or glory"" approach in a T20 match when fast runs are required, just as it is possible to build an innings in a test match with a more sober and judicious mindset.  When bowling, you will find that batsmen place a much greater value on their wicket in test matches - it is common (for me at least) to go many overs without a wicket, but when that breakthrough comes, it is tremendously satisfying.  Given that test matches can go for five days in real life, I think that Big Ant has done a good job of replicating this experience within the game.  Umpire decisions are imperfect, and it's possible to challenge a decision using DRS.  The vast majority of times, the umpire gets it right - but I have managed to challenge successfully a couple of decisions, and this has been a great thrill.To sum up the positives - there is a real emphasis on gameplay, and this has been executed very well.  It's enough to justify the purchase of the game.  I may have experienced a few gripes along the way, but the core of the game is solid, and in my opinion, this is the most important thing.The areas to be improved?Well, the graphics are fine, but not outstanding.  Having said that, they don't detract from the experience.  In-game sounds are fine but the commentary is insipid - hardly a gamebreaker, but something to be improved on in the future.  (I'm also a basketball fan, and the NBA2K franchise sets the standard for commentary as far as I'm concerned).  The one area I'm struggling with at the moment is the AI - I have found myself becoming increasingly more frustrated with this, particularly in short matches (ie: T20s).  In my recent experience, if my T20 team bats first, they win.  If they bat second, they lose.  Match simulations work well for the first innings, but the AI for run chases is just appalling.  It's so frustrating and disheartening when you bowl your guts out to restrict the batting team to a score of 100 to 120, only to find that your team falls ten runs short with 9 wickets in hand.  Running the simulation will never get them over the line - watching the rest of the team bat is almost torture.  (I remember a recent game when the two best batsmen in my T20 team needed 6 runs in the last over... they left three balls and hit the other three back to the bowler).  The AI running between the wickets is incredibly risk-averse (the only run-out I've ever seen in the game has been from when I was batting myself).  I'm about four years into my player's career at the moment, and these kinds of things are starting to make a big difference to my enjoyment of the game.There is nothing I have said in the previous paragraph which has not been raised in the forums, and to give them credit, the Big Ant developers have been responsive to player concerns.  Although there hasn't been a patch for a few months now, I'm hoping that the devs take all of this feedback into account for their next patch / version.Cricket fans - there's nothing else out there which will give you the same experience as this game.  Just buy it and support a team that will hopefully produce bigger and better things in the future.  Well done, Big Ant - and I look forward to your future releases.			"

												Graphics, game concept (Carrer Mode), level of playing are good but not very competitive and challenging after initially few weeks.Devs have giving good precious in new stuffs like hawk eye, DRS, the stumps camera etc but graphics has disappointed. Repeated commentry lines makes me turn off my speakers while playing.Somethings are unrealistic and frustrating, I play national game in India as well as play county game at the same time.Striker (batsman) play defensive shot of the last overs (while needing 3 runs to win of 2 balls)Having said that, Its one of the best cricket games for PC, Good Game but needs a lot of fine tunning and more response from the developers or interactive game developers in the forums.Tons of questions and suggestions are unanswered by them in the forums. We are kept in dark regarding the next update or what to expect in the near future in terms of game patches.FYI, last patch was updated 3 months back, and no signs of new patches - makes me lose interest in playing these days.Still I Would recommend the game, just for the expreince of carrer mode, seeing yourself play from club team to captaining the National team (lol in 2-3 season).

												No finer a control scheme was ever concocted for cricket. Holding the left trigger, timing your shot and then spanking the ball in a straight-6 is weirdly exhilirating. Commentary is a little half-arsed but it does try to emulate more successful titles (NBA 2K) and the visual presentation is lacklustre. However, the graphics and overlays at the end of the over simulate a TV style broadcast enough that they're worth watching.Interestingly, the only licensed player is Don Bradman but the game encourages you to download 'The Community's Best' which ends up being all the official players and leagues.Either add this one to your wishlist or just buy it outright but be warned, you MUST have a controller in order to play (no keyboard commands).

												Was a little disappointed with the need for a internet connection to play as well as requiring a Xbox Controller to play the game. As the controls ain't too complicated I've since gotten used to the controller and the graphics and realism looks good as well. Too bad they weren't able to get actual cricketers for their commentary team though I suppose a Judo specialist and SBS soccer commentator are good enough. The customising elements of the game are great and extensive and all in all give the player the ability to play the game of cricket how, where and with who they want.

Stats galore, customization galore, creating your own players, team, comps, etc. Runs perfectly with controllers in big picture mode. Bit of a learning curve to get the hang of it, the more you play the better you will get at it. Great fun coop play in bigpicture mode on a big tv with wireless controllers.Not much else you could ask for from a cricket game. The commentary is good and not annoying. Fielding is alright, but still getting use to it. If you going to buy a cricket game, this is the one to buy. Bowling takes a while to get use to and still getting use to it, but getting better.

												excellent cricket game, and one definitely for fans of the sport, if you've played the game or an avid fan, you won't find it all that difficult to pick up, if you haven't then you better be ready to learn as this has one hell of a steep learning curve. but once you've learned how to crack play it becomes an extremely fun game. my two complaints would be spin bowling is a little buggy depending on what controller you use, i can never get it past half way on spin, and the aspect ratio of a non standard screen doesn't seem to work			"

												This is the best ever Cricket Game developed till date. Right from the word GO, this gives the player an excellent experience. The best/lates inclusion in this game is the Career Mode which immerse you completely. Batting is amazing and bowling makes you feel truly a world class bowler. Needs too much concentration to play.			"

												This is the best cricket game I've ever played. The batting is balanced: the forward defensive stroke is very safe, while the aggressive shots are likely to end in you losing your wicket - you are rewarded for playing the right shot in the right situation (as opposed to blitzing every ball for six à la EA Sports Cricket). You have little time to react to a fast ball, and split-second decisions are required, just like in real life.The AI is reasonable - the fielding positioning is questionable, but the actual gameplay is very good. The amount of misfields and overthrows are about right compared to real life. The career mode is fantastic - you control only your player, so if you get out for barely any runs as a batsman, that's the end of your contribution for the innings: you can't then just control the next seven or eight batsman that bat after you. As a result, the games are quicker (you can simulate the bits you're not playing), and your performance is more in the spotlight.Of course there are a few problems: the commentary is about as wooden as the cricket bats, the animations are a little bit glitchy from time to time (certainly nowhere near EA Sports Cricket or Ashes 2013 levels), and there may be a slight mismatch in run rates between the simulated and live-mode game. But these are tiny issues against an overwhelming success of a game - especially considering this is Big Ant's first try at a cricket game.Rating: 8.5/10. Could be improved, but stands up well against any sports game ever made.			"

												I don't have too many hours played on the PC version but don't be fooled because I originally bought the game on Xbox 360 the day before official release day when the street date got broken and I've played this game a lot.This is without a doubt the best cricket game since Shane Warne Cricket 99 and it looks so much BETTER on PC and to be honest it's probably deserving of the best cricket game ever.I will say that bowling on higher difficulty levels can be more of a chore than a fun time and there, for me anyway, hasn't been that breakthrough from difficulty to enjoyment like there was when batting finally clicked, but I rectify this by batting as both teams and I have an amazing time.Batting is amazing once it finally clicks, and there is a bit of a learning curve especially if you jump straight in to pro, but it will come eventually after some frustrating times. Don't let challenge mean there is no enjoyment though, in career mode I was celebrating 20 runs like I scored a century and nothing felt as good as the first 50 and then 100.There is an amazing modding community over at planet cricket and if you're a retro lover like I am or just want the latest kits and bat sponsorship go over there right now and spend a bit of time getting the mods in to your game because the immersion that the mods brings takes this already fantastic game to a whole new level. Sometimes I just scan around the ground in awe at how great it looks.My Career is a great addition but it is a little barebones. That's not to say it isn't fun but don't expect NBA 2K level of career either.9/10 simply because nothing is perfect but this comes close. A must have for any cricket lover.			"

												I was afraid that there'd never be a cricket game after Ashes 2009, let alone a great one. But thanks to a group of passionate people at Big Ant, cricket game lovers have reason to hope for good circket games again.In DBC 14, devs took a risky decision to revamp the whole gameplay system that existed before, but in hindsight, that has proven to be a vastly successful decision. Another great quality of the devs is their continuous engagement with fans on forums, especially in the early stages, and the willingness to respond to feedback with patches that either improved gameplay or removed bugs. The gameplay experience improved a lot over time.This game isn't perfect, but I'm excited about the direction this game is headed in. Looking forward to DBC 16. Thanks again, Big Ant.			"

												I hope BigAnt build on this because it's a solid game. Cricket is inherently not an easy sport to digitally recreate but this is one of the better efforts so far. I guess the logical next step would be to fine tune the game physics slightly and to include motion captured bowling actions and batting stances (for the international players initially)Pros:The sounds are on point and the graphics are very acceptable. It feels like playing Cricket which is not an easy task to accomplish.Cons:After almost 200 hours, it has started to get a bit predictable and boring against AI but i guess the easy solution would be playing multiplayer (something i haven't tried).The shot variety is decent however it could do with more variety in the execution animation i.e. way the batsman looks while playing the same shot should be different for batsmen.

												Pretty much the closest you'll come to playing cricket without actually playing cricket. I am usually not a fan of sports games and have found cricket games in the past a little lame. This genre usually boils down to ""find the cheesiest method to win easy and repeat over and over"". Not this game.Game still has some minor issues but nothing I would rate gamebreaking. In fact the only reason these issues stick out is because everything else is so brilliant.Career mode! There's literally hundreds of hours of play there if you decide to play all the way through to retirement.A Warning: Batting can be frustratingly difficult beyond the rookie/amateur level due to reaction times otherwise this game is beyond awesome. Bowling on the other hand is way too easy on rookie/amateur levels but starts to get realistic on pro and beyond.Looking forward to DBC17!			"

												Finally there is a game which anyone who loves Cricket can play and enjoy which actually represents the game. Brian Lara used to be the benchmark but this redefines it. With codemaster and EA no longer developing Cricket games it's great that Big Ant developed this. Initially I was suspicious of having to play with a controller, all other cricket games were quite happy to be played with a keyboard. However once I tried it with a controller I could definitely see why it requires one. With one stick being used for foot placement and the other stick for direction, combining these two inputs with the modifiers (power,defensive,fancy) and the need for having proper timing means the array of shots becomes diverse and unpredictable. Also unlike other cricket versions this does not just descend into a boring slog match with every shot going for a 4 or a six. I have been able to use this to explain the game of cricket better to my children which means they enjoy cricket even more now and just for that alone I would recommend this to everyone who loves cricket.Pros- Great controls allow for diverse batting- Bowling is actually fun- Career mode where you actually need to develop your player from a rookie to an expert- Community generated content- A great physics engineCons- You need to be online to play- Occassionally the AI can behave strangely when running between wickets- Superhuman fielders- The cricket grounds are not particulary diverse			"
