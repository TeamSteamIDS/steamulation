												Botolo takes the basics of fighting game mechanics and strips it down to nearly the pure mind game. At the core, you are attempting to predict when you opponent is going to make a steal. There are interesting meta games that come out of the positioning, and trying to trick your opponent into thinking that you are attempting a steal. This game would work just with those bits, but it also contains a ton of different powers for the different players that change either the positioning game or the way the mind game works (you can do bluffs with some of the powers, or lock down zones with different tools).Try to play with a friend for your first match, it really comes alive against a human opponent.

												I've only played for a short time, but I can already tell you a few things for sure about this game:- it's gorgeous- it's got that delicious pure yomi feel without being a traditional fighter- nothing is horribly wrong with it, it's well made, it feels good to playThings I wish were there or were a bit different:- Online multiplayer would of course be amazing- I can't actually tell yet if the high scores for the singleplayer mode are online or not. If they are, there are very few other people playing so far! If they aren't, the choices of default scores are a little odd.- The menus are really cool, but take a bit too long to navigate sometimes. It's quite a few button presses to get into a match. This isn't a big deal.- keyboard controls kinda suck. you probably want to be able to play with a controller. I wish it were a little easier to move precisely with keyboard.			"
