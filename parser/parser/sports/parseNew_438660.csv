												the dark future of the airbud universe in which all positions have been replaced by dogs. children are slaves, spared only due to the need for thumbs to put proper spin on the football when passing. support the dog hegemony.the control is not good, however. you basically will need a proper wired mouse, and even if you do it will be awkward since the game was designed for swinging the wiimote, etc etc. being able to control the dogs with keyboard or controller would be good but sadly dogs have banned controllers as they require handsalso, singleplayer only? the hell is that about?edit: the developer has informed me that they would like to add gamepad and/or keyboard support. let's hope they are able to do so!

												It's not that bad, and not like there is much for Football games on Steam anyway. Could use multiplayer and achivements though. Oh, and it's a 3d game, so there really shouldn't be any reason not to have user selectable resolutions or even to play in widescreen mode. I didn't see anything editable in the game's files that affected the resolution. This game was on Wii, I can't imagine it was 4:3 square resolution on there, so not sure why it is here. Also the base price is too high. It should at most be $9.99 base and with the normal Steam sales at 75% off for $2.50 every time those are running. I can't imagine there is hardly anyone that owns this on Steam that didn't get it in the one bundle it was in. A year later and this is only the 7th review.			"

Breaking this game down to it's components, the quality of dogs is much greater than the quality of the football.  The controls are very finicky and provide little feedback on what the player should be doing.The canine focus of the game is great to bring in younger players by upping the cute factor, but the faltering gameplay will lead to most being frustrated.While this game had a noble goal of making increasing complex sports games accessible, it falls just shy of the mark.

												I give it a 7.5/10 Gameplay gets an 8/10The gameplay is nuts compared to like Madden.  I’m picking plays like I would in Madden but I have to think about the size of my dog and where to run because you can get a huge score by running through logs, riding skateboards and such, which are mostly on the sides of the field and give your dog a speed boost when used.  To maximize points you want to use different game balls and different powerups so lots going on vs like Madden.  I even found holding the right mouse button down to walk super useful on defense so I could hang back and then intercept or quickly take out a receiver.  Maneuvering the QB in the pocket and then going for the QB sneak also turned out to be a pretty solid tactic.  Basically Madden gets pretty stale for me in the gameplay department and Dog Football makes football worth playing with lots of tactical options and resource management to think about since game balls get destroyed and treats and balls need to be purchased and are necessary for playing well.Graphics get a 7/10Cartoony with a sense of realism meaning that even though the dogs look cartoony they mostly behave the way dogs would in real life.  They do touchdown dances and such which are probably not always realistic but hey I’ve seen Merengue Dog so who knows. I personally like a cartoony feel so the graphics work for me and are cohesive between environments, characters, and UI.  I’d still like to see a more realistic and updated look like for any future version.Sound gets a 7/10I like how the music is made to fit the personalities of each character.  Sound effects just fit the environments so that’s fine and the dogs sound like dogs so good enough.  This just doesn’t seem like the type of game where anything spectacular in the sound department is needed so seems like what is there is fitting.Replay Value gets an 8/10After playing a full season I was able to get everything for my team including all dog breeds and a new character and field to play.  It took a while and near the end of the season the AI was bringing it so I lost a few games.  I had fun trying to maximize bonus points on fields, want to beat the game with the other characters, and want to get all the gift boxes to get all the unlocks, so this has lasting appeal for me.  I hope they add multiplayer because that will keep me playing longer.			"

												Love it!  It's a great game for kids, but there's fun for adults too.  I really like the idea of pet sports!!  The graphics, sound and music are all really fun.  It's just a fun place to be when you're in the game.			"

												Literally one of the worst games I've ever played.  There are practically no plays you can call at the beginning, and when you run by everyone and there is no one within 20 yards of you, every dog on the other team will start chasing you and catch up to you in almost no time.  Part of me really wants to know how Jerry Rice's name got on this game, part of me feels like I'd just be disgusted.  There's also no good reason for the game to cost $20, and I wouldn't even pay $5 for it.  There is likely some entertainment value there for a few games if it ever dropped down to a buck or two, but even that seems unlikely.			"

												Well it could have been OK game, but.It's old and time hasn't done good for the game. Graphics are just plain ugly, and propably were even time of the realese.The controls aren't very intuative.And most important part. Dogs don't know how to play football. Neither does their handler.He or she holds ball in hands and then throws it away to dog, who just bites ball and trys to carry it.There is no goal, but somehow you get points after getting over a line at the end of the field. Everytime dog is down, there is time out and something and everything just starts over.After all football is about kicking ball into a net and team that scores more goals wins. "
