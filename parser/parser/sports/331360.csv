Early Access Review
								Don't think about it, just give this game a chance. It's free, if you don't like it, just uninstall it.This game is one of the coolest most interesting concepts for a game I've seen in the past decade.I'm not going to compare this game to a MOBA or Twisted metal which is what every single review of this game does, instead I'm going to describe it all on it's own.Heavy Metal Machines is a 4vs4 team based Battle Racing game. There is one simple objective, capture the bomb from the center of the map, and deliver it to the enemy's base, but it's not as simple as it sounds. Each team has their own race track on their side of the map that the enemy team has to transport the bomb through and your job is to stop them from getting there, intercept the bomb from them, and turn around to race it to their side of the map. With a plentyful roster of drivers with their own unique vehicles to choose from, you build a team of 4 with each player trying to fill one of 3 roles, Transporter, Interceptor, and Support.The Transporter's skill set revolves around mobility and keeping posession of the bomb while ""transporting"" it to the enemy base.As an Interceptor, you will be dealing damage to the enemy team's vehicles in an attempt to protect your bomb carrier, as well as taking theirs out.And last but not least, The Support class is very important, you'll be shielding, healing, and dishing out crowd control to make sure your team delivers the bomb without a hitch, it's an invaluable role as well as a very satisfying and fun role to play.Imagine a scene from Fast and Furious or Mad Max where a convoy of vehicles is battling it out for control of a precious cargo, that's what this game feels like, and it is just as awesome as it sounds.Give this game a shot, you won't regret it.

								Today I got banned from a forum for 2 weeks so decided to find a new game to play.  Didn't know what to expect with this one, but it's free to play, open beta, so I decided to give it a shot.  Played almost 2 hours non-stop before my hand cramped up from having a death grip on the mouse. Trying to match with others online took too long, but I did make the attempt when most people were at work or school.Played with bots instead, became a big fan of Larry Givens.Announcer is very excited about his job.Game doesn't take up much space, it's quick to load, and a lot of fun.10/10 would get banned from that forum and throw myself into lava again.

								Awsome game but don't compare it to League of Legends  because in this game you don't have to farm a lane or care about your mana.. only thing you do is go for the objective watch your hp and cooldowns and have fun! This is a non-stop action game with cars like Twisted Metal. I'd say the only thing that is similar to LoL is that you got one unit to control with a top view and you aim for your skills shots! Fun Fact : -Everything in the game can be unlocked with the game currency even the skins ! -One of the only f2p game that deserve to be played there is no Pay-2-Win!			"

								Heavymetal Machines has just recently released and at its core it has potential and enjoy ability. Came into the game hoping for a newer Twsited Metal type, what it plays like is more akin to Twisted Rugby to me. With 4v4 gameplay enough machines will give enough varying game play options as well as team work. Don't forget to upgrade between points, thats why the long time between go's.			"

								If you can't find a match on North American servers, try queing on the European servers.A very fun game, but has a lacking player base currently. If you're a fan of the gameplay in older games like Rock n' Roll Racing or Death Rally, or like the style and over the top vehicles from Twisted Metal or Mad Max, then I think you should give the game a chance. Or, if you enjoy MOBAs, then you may find that Heavy Metal Machines is a breath of fresh air for the genre, its something incredibly different compared to most MOBAs. Very rarely does a good game in this style appear, but I think that Heavy Metal Machine has a lot of potential.			"

								Heavy Metal Machines, MOBA meets racing. You chose your driver and battle against other players to deliver the bomb to the enemy teams base. Each driver has there own set of abilities that can be used in combat, to help your team or punish your enemies. Right now Heavy Metal Machines is in early access, so it does not have all the kinks worked out. That being said I felt the game was a higher than expected quality while I was playing it and I recommend anyone interested try it out as soon as they can. 1/31/17			"

								I DL'd this game because at first glance it reminded me of the old Blizzard title Rock n' Roll Racing, and I'm glad I did.  What a cool game to play for free.  It does look and sound like the old Rock n' Roll Racing, but Heavy Metal Machines puts it's own spin on the formula.  What they have created is super competative, capture-the-flag style car combat, and it's really fun.  Cool vehicles with unique abilities designed for competative team play.  Choose from a range of play styles.  Deal damage, be a tank, or a support class.  Level up your vehicle's abilities, and stats to become super powerful.  Dominate and jam out at the same time.  This is an easy recommendation.			"

Not to mention the soundtrack is fantastic (quite obviously metal themes). TLDR if you're thinking of trying this game: do it.			"

								I will admit I was a bit skeptical upon downloading this game.  I was pleasantly surprised on how good this game is. This game brings new light to the now stagnant MOBA genre.  If Mario Kart, Twisted Metal, and League of Legends had a baby, this is it. Right now as it sits, it takes a while to get into pvp matchups because of the low player base, but I am quite convinced this will change soon by how much of a gem this game really is.			"

Early Access Review
								Heavy Metal Machines Open Beta Review!The beautifully stylized, adrenaline packed world of Heavy Metal Machines (HMM) reinvigorates the Automotive Battle Arena genre. The beta took me back to the hay day of the Twisted Metal and Vigilante 8 franchises while older players will recall Rock n’ Roll racing and Combat Cars as more direct sources of inspiration for HMM. Veteran developer, Hoplon Infotainment, may be better known in Latin America having released games like Taikodom and Apocalypse: Party's Over from its offices in the incredibly beautiful Florianópolis, Brazil. HMM is intended to be a global affair with servers located in North America, South America, Europe, and most recently Asia. I expect this title to develop a robust competitive scene of 4 vs. 4 bomb delivery action (more on that below) as players in the beta are already quite competitive and are chatting away in the Heavy Metal Machines forums.The ArtI don’t usually start with the art work in a game but it's impossible to ignore the cohesive, hyper stylized world inside the walls of Metal City. The artwork is a wicked fusion of Mad Max and Darkest Dungeon tones blended with a darker version of the DC Comic's color pallet. The game has a ominous appeal to it, but not in a depressing way. Metal City is gloomy and damp, anchored by blues and purples but is splashed with the bright yellows and reds of lava and fire.While we will discuss the characters more below they are heavily stylized in their appearance which is consistently complimented by the machines they drive, abilities they use, and music they rock out too.The art work alone could sell Heavy Metal Machines for many gamers and is sure to catch people’s attention like it did on the floor of Twitch Con 2016 which I where I met the Hoplon road team.Game PlayElegant simplicity of objective and control scheme make this title easy to pick up while skill shot based abilities and fast moving vehicle action make it hard to master, exactly what you want in a competitive team game. While you can play with a controller, I haven’t tried it yet, so I can only discuss the mouse and key board controls. Holding down Left Mouse Button accelerates the car forward, Right Mouse Button flips the car around to drive in reverse, Q and W pop your basic abilities, R pops your character’s ultimate ability, and E gives you a burst of speed. Most (if not all) of the abilities have fairly standard cooldown mechanics that any MOBA or MMO player will be familiar with. Your ultimate must be charged up by dealing out damage or healing your friends so creating chaos for the opponent is reward by allowing you to create more chaos! Nice!The core game mode is a 4 vs. 4 bomb grab and delivery arena. A bomb spawns in the center of the map and teams charge into battle, grab the bomb, and attempt to drive it to their opponent's spawn location. You are free to drive almost anywhere on the large, symmetric map unless you are carrying the bomb which forces you to follow a longer, winding path. Tight turns, pools of lava, and zones that will knock the bomb out of your possession demand skilled driving. The other players are unencumbered by the bomb allowing them to cut corners and zip through short cuts ensuring they can catch up to the bomb carrier forcing high speed team fighting and chaotic offensive or evasive driving depending on your role. Scoring the bomb three times will result in a win!During game play you can earn ""Metal"" by beating up on the opposition that allow you to buff your vehicle and its abilities in various ways. You can pick from an assortment of generic boosts like additional health and higher damage or you can directly boost the effectiveness of your abilities. These customization options only last for a single match meaning that you can experiment with different builds and adapt your build to counter the bad guys or compliment your friends.More recently an in game VoIP has been added WHICH I LOVE. I can’t stress this enough, yes it leads to people flaming, yes you will have mic trolls, and soundboards can be annoying (or really awesome if done well) BUT nothing showcases a community's culture or encourages competitive play like VoIP in game. I’ve spent way too many hours playing Counter Strike and I firmly believe the allowing for mic communication in game is a core reason that the Counter Strike franchise has had so much staying power in the eSports universe. Players can strategize, communicate on a deeper level, and even when players are being salty, VoIP can encourage a competitive culture that drives eSports participation in a game. There have been complaints about flaming and mic spamming (I have been flamed on stream) but I think the benefits of open, in game VoIP far out weight the costs in a game built for competition like Heavy Metal Machines.CharactersThe motif of a Gwar Concert meets Mad Max Fury Road and what must have been a comic book obsessed art team to create the Metal Heads that populate Heavy Metal Machines' Character selection screen. Every character has a story, style, and sound track with move sets that compliment their personalities. Run the bomb to its final destination with a speed metal obsessed ""transporter"" class or knock your opponents off course with crowd control heavy ""interceptors"". Feeling like more of a soft rock fan? That's ok, HMM has support characters that allow you to heal friends, debuff bad guys, and out right silence the enemy jam session. My favorite Character at the moment is Full Metal Judge, technically an interceptor, FMJ can lay down the damage with a front mounted gatling gun while pulling away from the pack with a ramming ability that doubles as a speed boost. Worth mentioning that I haven't tried out Killer J, a clown of questionable morals, who was released in a recent patch. CriticismThe VoIP could be open during the character select screen so that teams could more easily communicate composition and character selection.Players dropping from matches leading to unbalanced 3v4 (or worse) fight. I wont comment on this much since Hoplon has already addressed it in a recent post. The gist is that players are dropping from matches more frequently than expected and the game does not attempt to replace the lost player at this point.While simplicity of objective and the games easy to grasp control scheme are some of the game’s greatest strengths they do create a depth of content issue. After testing out a few characters you’ll eventually find a character you resonate with and likely stick to them as you grind your fame up and level up the driver to unlock new skins. Once you complete your daily quests it’s the same map and game mode over and over again. The ability to upgrade cars in match can break this up if you are willing to experiment with builds but this can only go so far. What the game could use at a minimum are additional maps or possibly some additional game modes. Hoplon has already addressed some of these concerns in a recent post stating that ""our main – competitive – game mode is the bomb delivery. Which does not mean that we will not build other modes or that the current map will be the only one ever. We fully plan in adding more maps for the bomb mode, and – eventually – adding different modes altogether."".Some of the abilities are meant to be held down as opposed to pressing and quickly releasing the button associated with an ability. If a player actually reads the tool tip this is pretty obvious but assuming that most players don’t actually read menus there may be a UI change that could make this game mechanic more obvious to new players.Review was originally posted to http://www.infirmarygaming.com/articles/news/general/58/game-review-heavy-metal-machines-beta/In full disclosure Hoplon has provided DLC content to the Infirmary Gaming Community which I manage and write for.

								Feels to me like a MOBA version of Rocket League. It took all of 30 seconds to hook me. It's a bit like tug-of-war with vehicles and explosives.It's reasonably accessible to newbies, but a lot of room for competitive play, and the devs are working to enhance both aspects.The player base isn't huge, but if you play on the EU servers instead of NA, it usually only takes about 3 minutes to find a match.

								Good game concept, poor controls.This game reminds me of a game called rock n roll racers from back in the day. The music is metal (cant go wrong with that), the design looks good. Gameplay is a twist on MOBA style games, making it entertaining for a bit. Graphics are cool (not the best for todays standard, but who cares!).Controls are what let the game down. You either use mouse and keyboard, in not the way you'd think; or use an xbox360 controller for windows, no other usb controller (or wireless if you have one) will work. This is what really lets the game down.People complain about online lag, is early access, it may have a few issues there			"

								Quite the interesting game. The metal aspect is what drew me to this game. The metal aspect is well done in my opinion. The art is interesting and the gameplay is fun, though the announcer can be annoying at times. For early access it's really good, for a full free to play game it's okay, and it looks promising. Someone else went on about lag, I didn't have any in the offline segments (maybe I was just lucky) and there were one or two lag spikes when I played for about half an hour online (I had a good connection), but it's still in early access so I expect the developers to fix such problems when it is eventually released for real. Pros- Proper gameplay- Great music- Good art- Enthousiastic announcerNeutral- It's a MOBACons- It's in early access			"

								Even in Early Access, the game is pretty complete, with a few minor bugs.But let's go to a more specific review :)Pros:- Fast paced action;- Somewhat similar to a MOBA, yet VERY different from one;- Larry Hoffman;- Simple, yet strategical gameplay;- The music!!!- Interactive tutorial;- Help screen with topics, if the tutorial was not enough to make you learn the game;- The developers interact with the comunity to make the game better;Cons:- The matchmaking is weird, to say the least;Others:- The actual controls (IMO they are very annoying), but this doesn't enter the cons, due to constant changing based on feedback.- Some new players (MOST) that refuse to learn the game (there is an interactive tutorial AND a help page with topics), and this make the gaming experience terrible for the others.This is NOT a racing game!!! It's a car arena game!!!Learn the difference please. The main goal of the game is the bomb that spawn in the center of the arena.DO the tutorial, join the official Discord, the forums, the facebook page, and ask your questions about gameplay. The comunity is very receptive to players wanting to learn to play the game. But using the excuse of ""i don't know how to play"" to ruin other people matches is frowned upon.Again, this is NOT a racing game. Learn the game before going into pvp.			"

								What happens when you cross 'Rocket League' with 'Twisted Metal' and 'Super Off-Road?'  You get the addictive insanity that is Heavy Metal Machines.  Very simple to pick up, but contains a lot of depth to improve your skills on as teams of 4 battle it out.  You'll quickly find yourself having a blast as you discover new ways to deliver the bomb with maximum carnage.			"

								First thing I seen was the tutorial cutscene, I was sold; Was just about the same as Twisted Metal: Black.Great game, very funny moments.Fast paced, Easy to slip up.Your objective is to grab the bomb in the middle of the base and take it back to your spawn point. There are other things than just that, But it's the jist of it anyways.I seen that a champ was being sold for 10k fame, so expect the same basis of league of legends. Overpowered champs when they're new, get nerfed back to oblivion when another new one comes out-wash and repeat.Other than that, this game is awesome and can't wait to see what becomes of this game.I would reccomend this game to LoL, Dota, or just plain old, racecar driving fans.

That unfortunately is where the issues come in. Around 50% of the games if not more, there is someone who is afk, or disconnects. This is killing this game imo.

								Remember that game by X-Gen studios way back when? Black Rage online? Probably don't... Uhh... Interstate '76? No... That's too realistic... I mean, PS generation Twisted metal would be a good comparison I suppose, but it's got less of a pick-up and map-focused game. ♥♥♥♥ it, basically it's a surprisingly well polished top-down arena shooter with an emphasis on class/ability based team play. The game plays quite smooth and controls well, and can have keys rebound to how you like. My only real problem with it is lack in content, and lack of expanded metal genres. Seems like it's only got rock metal for now, but would do well with others like industrial and perhaps that which made the DOOM soundtrack so good. though I have to give the composer credit, as I found myself losing a match headbanging...

								This is a fantastic mashup between Twisted Metal and Rock N Roll Racing all folded into a MOBA format.  The game is 4 v 4 Bomb Run, which pits playes in a symmetrical arena with mini race tracks on either side.  The bomb spawns in the middle and the teams fight to carry the bomb through the opposing team's track and into their goal.  There are three classes: transporter, support and interceptor.  Transporters specialize in moving the ball, interceptors specialize in damage and crowd control while support specializes in heals and crowd control.  The first time I played it, I honestly thought it was a frantic mess.  Ten games later, I'm strategizing with my friends over team comp, devising new ambushes and learning to drive backwards while carrying the ball and fighting off enemies.  The game offers surprising depth and competition, while the devs have already promised new modes which all sound amazing.  I'd say the only thing the game currently lacks is a playerbase, so hop on in!			"

								Remember Rock N' Roll racing on the Sega Genesis? It's like that, but a 1000 times better. If you weren't alive to play video games in the 90's, Heavy Metal Machines is a 4v4 fight over a single bomb that has to be delivered to the enemies goal. You have different classes of cars to choose from. Healers that heal, interceptors that fight, and transporters that are good at moving the bomb. Each match lets you buy upgrades specific to your character, things like extra damage from your Q attack or faster nitro cooldown. Teamwork is important, as you can pass the bomb to another teammate if you need to. Teammates also have to help heal you and peel off the enemy as they try to stop you from delivering the bomb. The 1 level you play on has hazards that can pop the ball off the carrier or just destroy a vehicle in lava which adds extra strategy.Pros - Fun, and unique gameplay        - Car choices are varied and all have different strengths and weaknesses        - Announcer and character voices are great. At respawn a certain character might say ""Witness me!""        - Graphics are good and the game runs in 4k for me on my 1070        - Mouse controls work wellCons - AFKer's. It's a problem in any game. When someone afk's here no bot takes over and the player's car just sits there         - Bit of a grind to buy anything in game. It's all cosmetic though         - 1 map, and only 1 gamemode. Early access woes. I hope they get at least 4 more maps and add a racing mode The game runs very smoothly for me, unlike some other reviewers. I haven't had any crashes or freezing issues. It's a free game! Try a few rounds, play each type of car to see what fits your play style.			"

								Before anything i'd like to say, Not only is this game amazing but also fun so far and i can't wait for more maps, game modes and characters. Even the soundtrack is pretty sweet. There needs to be more games that not only has a Rock n Roll soundtrack but a metal as h*** game as this. A game that isn't afraid to show a rock n roll nature. I really hope this can become a big title among the racing and MOBA genres. <So far though, i have two complaints. These are minor complaints but can still steer away some players. 1st: The first complaint has to do with changing settings grapical or other. I've personally had the game try to if not crash when ever i would try to change these settings to my preference. This after only clicking one thing to change and it happens everytime i try to change something. 2nd: This maybe a nit pick but i find it odd that the punishing system for leavers is attatched to Practice Mode. I find this a problem because most/some people don't want to play a regular match, don't know if they can play the game at all with other players, testing out different graphics, or just wants more try a new character(game modes and maps later)and train vice versa. It seems rather silly to punish someone who wasnt in a real PvP match. No one should get punished from deciding that they've got a hang of the character and want to leave the bot match to try he/she out in a PvP match or because someone disconnects due to bad connection in a bot/Practice match either.> End of complaint, sorry if i emphasized too much on the last bit. Anyways, you guys are doing awesome, game is awesome and i hope everything can get worked out. Thank you for listening and give me feedback if you get this message. So i know you got the message and i didnt waste my time, lol.			"

								Give the game a shot its currently free to play. You can play all the cars and no money involved to Pay to Win. My maching if 5 years old and plays the game without a hitch so cannot comment on the people giving bad review because of lag or unable to play.  Its kind of like a MOBA in the sense you have to push the ""lane"" or in this case the 1 track and carry the bomb over the end line.  The game is 4 v 4 in PvP and the games when evenly matched take around 20 to 25 minutes. Its much quicker when one side is more experienced than the other team. But as I have been on that side a lot lately at least the game ends quick. :) The cars are all unique and well balanced at this point.  There are 3 main types and within each type different styles such as the interceptor or carry can either push, pull using a skill shot or just do a lot of damage. The bomb carrier is fast or has some sort of small heal mechanic.  The support heals but each in a different way depending on how you like to play.  Overall the game is fun to play and I was shocked I liked it so much. I only tried it as it was free and was looking for something different that I could pick up at any time and play. This fits the bill perfectly.  I also like that the cars are all playable and I don't have to drop any money to get the ""must"" have cars to compete.  I plan on throwing a few bucks at the game when it goes live to show my gratitude for this decision if it is kept that way at launch. Again just try it, but please play a few practice games first! :)			"

								So anyone who has played Rock and Roll Racing back in the day has to give it a try.  Pros - Announcer is great - Gameplay is fun - I could be very good if it gets a steady populationCons - After you drop the ball and score the round is over... you still get killed.  It is just annoying. - At the start of each match the camera goes in and out of focus then pans.  The combination makes me dizzy and something close to nausianted.  It is pointless. - Queued for  10 min to play againts players.  Nothing happened. - Bots are too easy, traps on the track are too easy. Put traps in the center not the sides where you wouldn't drive anyway.More cons then pros but the gameplay trumps all the cons.  Give it a shot.			"

								Summary:You kills other cars with your car which has car powers but everyone also has car powers and there's a bomb. Pros:+Gameplay is really, really fun in its current state.+It's super easy to get the hang of. Tutorial takes about 5 minutes and after that. you're off! +Characters seem well balanced+How well you do is based on how well you can manuever the car+New, fresh game concept (as far as I am aware)Nuetral: This can be seen as good or bad depending on your preference, but non of the abilities do a lot of damage. This makes fights last longer, but makes positioning more crucial and does a good job at balancing fights since it relies less on who you pick but rather on who is a better player in general. Cons:-Art style and general aesthetic is pretty.... unappealing. Game looks ♥♥♥♥♥♥. -Voice acting is atrocious and annoying.-Long waiting times to get into a match, I imagine this will be resolved with more players.-My game freezes every 30 seconds for about a second while I'm playing, but it hasn't stopped me from enjoying the game.

All you need is a few games, 3-4-5, depending on your flexibility, you need to read the abilities of you cars, ( that takes 3 min and you are a pleb if you play mobas and don't know ur abilities, i mean, ""what are you doing ?"" ) to get into the Real FUN. And yeah It is REALY FUN.You don't have to believe me, just play 3-4 games with the same car.It also has cons. Sometimes the que time cam be long, 5-10 min max, Low player based. Only one map. Low number of cars.The cons can dissapear if the player base will increase. So ... If you like it after a few games, this game will grow and will level with all the popular mobas, and even grow to get at a eSport level.PS: i'm writing the review to convince people to join the game, cuz the game will improve if we get more player base.So, up to you. All the best.			"

								After waiting for only 20 seconds to find a match, one guy in my team didnt choose a car in time and as the countdown reached 0 an error about connection problems apeared and my game crashed. 5/7 perfect score! xDNo really, this game has a big potential to be a fun moba-like racer with some action, explosions and nice music!

								Hello. I would like to say that i`m really gratefull for a game that makes me wanna come back to it. For now the one really big problem that i see is the minimal penalty for leaving a game.

								Quite Honestly I like this game, I'm not sure how, or why. It's as if they took a designer from every recent game success and threw them in a room until they worked together better than congress. I skipped the tutorial and decided to jump right in with friends and about our second match we almost figured out what was going on. It's a hilarious time and I can't wait to see where this game goes.11/10 still can't successfully pass the ball.			"

								If any of you are old enough to have played twisted metal black or sprint the old arcade game I would be very suprised if you don't enjoy this game, the game at this point has been out a month it's pretty buggy with dc's but its an early access game that doesnt steal your money and is complete but with little content, it's free, fun and worth a try!Happy to see an early access game that is actually playable for a lengthy amount of time and no large price tag for somthing uncomplete, micro transactions are completely optional and a good way to support the developers.(by complete I mean all of the games core is there it just needs ironing and future content)			"

								Hell yes, this will be a ton of fun I think, I couldn't play with my controller (Xbone elite) as it refused to give me any forward motion or steering, this has happened with other games as well they've all worked fine with the normal Xbone controller though.I decided to play with mouse but I did notice it put quite a strain on my wrist as I was pressing way too hard, this is of course my fault and not the game's. (it also has a bit to do with being new to the game of course)You can bind the keys as you wish including mouse keys and even though that should be something normal it isn't so I've noticed so I thought I'd mantion it.It's free, it's fun and it's metal madness, grab it and have a laugh. :)			"

								Reasons I don't recommend this game. (will change the review after dev fix these problems)1.Crash-game easily crash and reconnect gives 0exp and fame.2.Glitch-sometimes the screen will froze at one place(especially after the touchdown) but you know the game is still on going. there was still fuel bar when start of another round. but u couldn't do anything but to disconnect and apparently after disconnect you can't reconnect. wasted 1 round time.3.Chat-you can't just close the chat when the game just ended. We should be able to chat during the scoreboard and reward phase. What kind of game doesn't let you type in GG at the end of a game.4.Buy-when we buy stuff we need time to read regarding what does it do, but all I did in this game is just simply buy stuff without even looking because there was no time to even look. This is not d2 or LOL, this game's round end fast. If one of the player takes their time waiting in spawn and shopping with ur mama, the opponent will surely reach our spawn.5.Class/role-When I play with other players I will see what role they pick. Transporter/interceptor/support is important. For default there should be 1 trans 1 supp 2 inter, but I've to click on every one of the character that my teammate choosen to be able to know what is the role. It was pain in the ♥♥♥. We should be able to see the role of teammates easier.That was all for major parts. There was still more but I don't think that was important. Just some small details for improvement.1. Change the score to number rather than 3 bar above the screen.2.Can check out profile of each cars at the menu rather than going to store.3.add voice that state that ""you have possession of the bomb"", ""your team drop the bomb"" or ""enemy team drop the bomb"" etc rather than ""stop it, stop it, stop it now UHHh!!~~""(something that is not useful) That was it for now. Hope that developers can fix it and improve.			"

My friend joined me in a group and wasn't getting xp till i made her lead then we both were getting xp. We started a game in practice and when it asked to start game and we pulled out it made us wait 3 min to play again. For being out a week it’s not bad but needs to get better.			"

								Was expecting Rock n Roll Racing(duh), seems decent, but needs work. Kinda boring CTF-mode, hopefully other arenas and modes will be added, but chasing a bomb back and forth got old quick. UI needs work; you can't see skills or anything after you confirmed your guy, and if you wanna read up on em all before choosing, then you still gotta know what your mates have picked, which you also can't check because their picks are grayed out/unclickable(it seemed). Annoying stuff.Talking about annoying; unskippable(?) cutscenes before/after every game, and after each score. So if you thought you could get some extra time looking at upgrades or something, you're wrong. You're stuck listening to a decent but generic announcer which is almost more of a ripoff than a homage to Rock n Roll Racing.""Let the carnage begin!""Music generic as well since I guess they can't afford licensed stuff, but it works. What made me quit was game shutting down randomly while I carried the bomb over to the other half with a 2-0 lead. Got back in and it's 2-1 and two more disconnected, one in each team, so we're playing 3v3 and for some reason their formula 1 car suddenly becomes unstoppable and we lose 2-3. Why does every multiplayer game have to be coop or teambased? What about FFA or Deathmatch?			"

								Heavy Metal Machines is like a mix of Rocket League and DotA (still pointed more towards DotA).You play 4vs4 with ""machines"", being weaponized cars (divided in Interceptor, Transporter and Support). The goal is to transport the bomb, which is in the middle of the map through a pretty long enemy lane to their base (and crush the enemys vehicles on the way). These ""machines"" count as individual characters, having their own abilities and customisability with money you earn when doing damage to enemy cars. They also have an ultimate ability, which activates when a certain amount of dmg is done.Atm there arent many players and you have to wait a couple of minutes to actually find a match. On the other side many players are experiencing crashes and disconnects (i guess more than half of my matches had at least one leaver).Though i couldnt even play the tutorial, cause it didnt load.After all i really like the concept and those matches that fully play 4vs4 with no leavers are very interesting and fun.I believe this can develop to a great game, when the technical problems will be solved soon.

When someone leave/afk let us mark them as afk and get a bot instead until he/she returns. I've only had two afks so far. but both of the time it p!ssed me offAfkers cant be punished they only lose a little ""Fame"" and by little I mean 10. Uhuhu that hurts..PLUS!!!you get more out of bot game than pvp.So I wont play with any other players before this game is getting better. I like the consept and all that sheit. but come onOK FOCK IT!

								This game has the potential to be amazing. But....when i first started, my first 3 matches I did not earn any xp at all but the rest of the party did. Also the cooldown times for your abilities are a little to long I felt I was waiting for an ability to come off cool down most of the game and just trying to catch up to the enemy, which by the way always seems to be that much faster than you no matter what vehicle you choose lol . Your ultimate ablility you will pretty much never get to use unless the game last for more than 10 min because it takes that much time to charge. The controller situation seems alittle stupid as well, you can set the settings for all the moves besides moving forward. It tells me to use L joystick but the entire party couldn't get our cars to go foward, so we went to change in options but come to find out there is no option for forward. There were also many times were I have a least 3 enemys right beside me, use one of my attacks but did nothing as far as damage is concerned. As I said in the beginning this game has a lot of potential but needs work to really get it truely enjoyable to play.			"

Heavy Metal Machines is a 4vs4 team action racing game that mixes a heavy metal soundtrack with an action-packed Mad Max-inspired world. Basically, is a mix of Rock'n Roll Racing and Twisted Metal.Two teams compete in frantic battles to deliver the bomb to the opposing side's base. Each team has their own race track on their side of the map that the enemy team has to transport the bomb through and your job is to stop them from getting there, intercept the bomb from them, and turn around to race it to their side of the map. The team of four players have three roles that each one can fill: Transporter, Interceptor, and Support. The cars are very customizable and the game offer a lot of skills, you can access a wide variety of skills by trying out new characters, each offering four abilities for use in battle.Great intro and the tutorial is excellent. The soundtrack and the graphics are very good, I really liked it. Trying to match with others online took too long, but it's normal because the game is recent and have yet a low playerbase. You may also find some bugs, but it's normal. HMM with a nice and significant playerbase can be a successful game, and I'm not a big fan of racing games.			"

								This is seems to have had some great reviews but unfortunately when I lanched it, all I could achieve is enjoy the menu screen I couldn't even launch the tutorial so I don't know whether it's because it's still in beta mode but there's lots of work that probably needs to be done before making it a good one.Thanks			"

								Before the full review: I wouldn't say this game is bad, by any means, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a car carnage clash with explosions everywhere, because there aren't any. However, I go over some of these points in the full-review below. By ALL means, try the game out!This game is very fun, it has unique concepts and the overall mad-max sort of style is awesome to play with. However, for the actual gameplay, it's incredibly hard to actually gain bomb-control. For example, if the enemy has the bomb, there's very little chance you can actually gain control of the bomb. Cars are too tanky and abilities deal little to no damage. This game should be about CARNAGE! And destroying everyone!! But its hard to do that when you're up against a Transporter class with 500 Health and your abilities do about 10 damage each to it. I think cars should deal damage to eachother when running into eachother, death timers should be lower and it should be easier to get kills. The bomb should always be flying around the map amidst a rumble of players destroying eachother. Actually taking the bomb to the enemy base should be something incredibly hard to do. From my expierience, I can get it off the start, and drive it to the enemy base with little to no reprecussions apart from 5 damage a second from holding the bomb. For a game which is very fast paced, the fighting really isn't. The overall objective is way too easy to complete. This game has SO much potential, I just don't think it's being unleashed yet.			"

								I'm a pretty avid LoL and Smite player, and I really wanted to enjoy this game. It looked really fun when I watched Brofresco play it, and I can see how one day it would be in a proper release state (as opposed to early access) when it might be fun. But, for now, the game suffers from really severe balance issues: some big machines simply mow through an entire team, others are too nimble to even catch up with. I already realized after playing only a bit of this game that this was a big problem. Queue times were fine, interface is sort of hard on the eyes but that's fine because I found everything. Currently, I'd request that 1) you allow people to see the abilities of a machine BEFORE entering a game 2) you allow for a mode where you can test out new cars without having to battle other cars (sandbox or custom game) 3) matches are too short and feel too one-sided, so although I realize this is the hardest to fix, balance the machines out more and finally 4) stop trying to bandwagon the current MOBA boom. Some of those tropes feel cheap and I would suggest an approach like HOTS has done, where it has taken big MOBA elements like the upgrade store and revamped it as an XP pool which gives intermittent buffs. This encourages team play, farming, objectives, and kills, a lot more than the ""metal"" system does, which outside of ""killing other machines"" is impossible to come by.This idea is super cool. I want to see this game work. But right now it's mediocre at best.You guys gotta put some elbow grease in, starting right about now, because this has tons of potential and now is the time to show that.			"

								I played this game in CB, using the game-pad the game was impossible to play. Now that its in beta f2p on steam, using the game-pad is still terrible, thankfully using the mouse works perfectly. So what's the problem with this game?Simple: It's not a racing game with weapons. It's not a terrible game, but car combat only with no racing is not something I'm interested in. ""Unless its similar to Carmageddon 3"" Heavy Metal seems  to be some sort of bomb destroy mode to play. No thanks. Game should have been a racing combat game with plenty of maps to ride around in, with snow, weather, thunder, plenty of weapons , maybe some random loot drops, car customization, a story mode. But good luck those those who play it. I'm sticking with Death Track Resurrection.			"

								Top down view game where you control a car with your mouse. Wherever you point, that's where your car goes. The keyboard controls the inevitable MOBA-style abilities with cooldowns. That's right it's another game with cooldowns and ultimates, because Mike Morhaime and Gabe Newell made a lot of money with cooldowns, so it must be the secret ingredient to success. Also, heavy metal, because according to the opinion section of the Wall Street Journal, which is always right about everything and is way ahead of the curve, heavy metal is popular in Indonesia. How could it be wrong?How about this guise; a basketball game with cooldowns. Press W to score a 3-pointer (30 second cooldown). Press E to score a lay-up (10 second cooldown). Press S to pass the ball (5 second cooldown). Press QQ for the ULTIMATE FINAL SLAMDUNK (180 second cooldown). But wait, there's more. Every player has their own special and unique set of passive abilities which can be unlocked for only $9.99 per player, or 12 trillion experience points. Plus, if you get our $29.99 visum, you can witness amazing secret animations such as and the like and so on and so forth and the such as players pooring water on their faces, shaking hands after the game, and talking to the trainer during time-outs. Press X to call a time-out (requires a $150 XBOX Elite controller), now only costs 1700 mana and has been changed into a channeled ability. Only available for season pass players.- Rabbi Eli Yawnstein.			"

""thats right, i called you a pathetic kid"" WHAT ARE YOU GANNA DO ABOUT IT? this game isnt good enough... its new today... and players are scoping it out...but i give it 1 week before the positive reviews go to mixed reviews... and it will become harder and HARDER to join a match. its NOT worth investing money into... its NOT worth downloading at this time.,,,you know what? i didnt even bother checking the in game store...im not even going to. i already un-installed the game. im pretty sure its pay to win though... but go ahead... throw away you're govt. money1. same map over and over again2. long waiting times for multiplayer matches3. even if you get in a multiplayer match, you CANT kill other players4. most likely pay to win... i didnt check.. im not ganna. just noticed in game store5. population is too lowthis game could be SAVED if the developers make the following: why not add a giant soccor ball on the map instead of a  bomb? why not have the option to do lap racing? why not make more than 1 map? why dont you have machine guns attached to ALL vehicals? you know what? this game is beautiful and i can see there has been alot of great work put into this... but ive also been folowing this game... and its been held back ""free to play"" for years.... i thought it would never come out on steam. i un-installed the game because i'm pretty sure its ganna go dead pretty soon. its a beautiful game though... a lovely idea... just needs a ton more work.. and 2 to 3 updates a month... or the players will just leave and never come back. customers need to know if the developer isnt here to play ""cash and grab"" theres SOOOOOO many games on here ""some that aint here no more"" that got ontop steam being called the ""cash grab games"" that is.. a developer will stop with the updates and just leave the pos the way it is while sitting back collecting money. well... thats my review...thats all for now 02/01/2017p.s: KIDS....STAY THE HELL OFF MY REVIEW.... I DONT NEED LITTLE CHILDREN WHO STILL LIVE WITH THEIR MOMMY AND DADDY STILL POOPING THEIR PANTS BEING ON THIS THREAD... IF I WAS YOU'RE PARENT.... I'D BELT THAT MOUTH OF YOU'RS FOR SPEAKING TO ME LIKE YOU THINK YOU OWN SOMEONE			"

								Queue times so long that its made it all the way to page 17 on the free to play most popular. Behind such gems as gotham city imposters and everquest 2. Just got trolled when the opposing team managed to give the bomb to an afk player on my team and refuse to kill him for an hour. funny? sure. frustrating? most definitely. Ridiculous that it can even happen? absolutely. Fun as hell too when you get lucky enough to actually play it.Fix the queue times and balance the vehicles and theres so much hope.10/10 for how many minutes it takes to queue.Would queue grind again.

								Interesting game and it's like how it's supposed to be. Metal, cars, flames, fight till death. Few characters up to now since it's still in early access but it seems rly promising. Their servers are somehow problematic and there are a lot of DCs but i think the devs will fix this.  Also it's hard to earn money to unlock new characters (if you dont do the daily missions), but it's a rly nice game overall and it will be fun to play with friends. Good music, quick matches. Let's hope for the best !			"

								This game is interesting. The best way I can describe it for y'all is that it's like playing a MOBA, while playing capture the flag, all while driving a car. I played through the tutorial and a game or 2 but did not enjoy the gameplay that much. However the game is not bad so I'm still going to recommend try it. I can see the potential and think others may enjoy playing it. Also, it's free to play(in game purchases available).			"

Early Access Review
								Not too shabby. The game is a cross between Rock and Roll racing, and twisted metal. The downside- Buying upgrades every match. Where as this is fun in Moba style play sometimes...it usually becomes the cookie cutter approach, and everyone grabs the same things each time for said character. The map gets repetitive (Hopefully more maps will come with obstacles and such at release). Would like to see some possible permanent upgrades availible either for Fame costs, or in game ""cash"". Sure, make em semi expensive if needed, but the pay to win model is really turning many players off. Very small player base right now as well, wait times are big enough your team will be filled with bots...in competetive play.....The Plus side- Great graphics, awesome music. Play controls are simple and smooth. Matches can be fast, (sometimes a steam roll though). Decent variety of characters. They could easily do with coming out with more every so many weeks, new matches, new styles, new maps. Game has a lot of potential to be awesome fun. Let's hope they don't drop the ball.			"

								This game is everything Rock and Roll Racing would be if it was released today.Even though is shifts away from just a Death Race game, instead going for a Capture the Flag Deathmatch with cars, it's really loyal and respectful for the original game, RnRR. The gameplay isn't that hard as I saw some mention, it's easy to control the cars using the mouse if you're used to games where you need to move your mouse slightly faster.Each character has two skills and a Ultimate which are usually quite unique even though some have really similar skills.At the end of the day, the only real problem with the game is the lack of players. It takes forever to find a match and it hurts since the game is too damn good. But hopefully once more people play the game this is solved and the queue times are shortened.This game is amazing. Play it.			"

Early Access Review
								MOBA meets Rock and Roll Racing in a nice little package with unique characters and abilities.I have to say this about this game, however.  The way you go about upgrading is very similar to Awesomenauts, in that you're limited in what you can purchase per weapon.  The breakdown:Graphics: 4.5 - From what I've seen, the graphics are polished, stylized to represent a post-apocolyptic setting, and the effects are nothing to sneeze at.  Everything is well represented, though you might get a little confused with what's going on with several things happening.  You may also get stuck a few times not knowing where you're facing.Sound 4 - I just love the roar of the engines, but the announcer.....let's just say he's no Larry from Rock and Roll Racing.  I applaud the fact that some of the lines are lifted from R&RR (""The stage is set.  The green flag drops.""  ""Let the carnage begin!""), however, some of it seems out of place.  For example, there really is no race other than racing to get to the bomb first, but it becomes a matter of taking out opponents, and, again, it's not about coming in first in a race.  Other than that, I like how they're trying to trigger my nostalgia from the SNES/Genesis classic racing game.Controls 4 - I have to knock this down a bit.  My XBox 360 controller just won't respond well to the game at all.  I can't move forward, only reverse.  Left stick tells me that it should work, but doesn't.  There's no way to accelerate with the controller.  That said, the keyboard/mouse controls work farily well, but do get some getting used to.  I suggest going into practice mode a few times to get accustom to them.Gameplay 5 - I like a good MOBA game, and I enjoy it even better when they try something new.  This is a mixture of automobile battle and CTF (or payload from TF2).  It's a fun idea, and I hope other game modes come out for this.  I can see a load of other fun games they could add to spice things up.Overall 4.25 - I enjoyed what I've played so far, and hope to actually try online multiplayer (as of this writing, I've only had experience with practice mode).  However, I can see this being an engaging, fun little game for any MOBA player or racing fan.  I suggest trying it, as it's free, and....""LET THE CARNAGE BEGIN!""UPDATE: Controller support works, but I do have one other gripe.  At the start of online multiplayer, a system to sync every player before the race starts is of major importance.  I know my system is a bit of a potato now adays, but I'm able to load and play, but during multiplayer games, the game throws me in when the battle has begun.  It's a bit of a hiccup to catch up, but I still managed to do something in the end.  Something for the devs to think about.			"

								This is actually my first game review I've done, so I'll try not to ramble.  What originally attracted me to this game was that It looked like a cross between twisted metal and the seminal arcade classic Offroad, and I had no clue about the moba aspect of the game until I had logged in and ran through a tutorial. There are quite a few vehicle-based pvp games surfacing lately, and although many lack personality or depth, Heavy Metal Machines is a strong entry into the genre.The music is good, and there are plenty of characters to try in beta, but the lack of arenas in the game (I encountered 1) is a bit redudant.  Regardless, the game is fun with strong replay value.  It's very remenicent of Micro Machines on NES (only you older timers will get that one).  The pvp has some complexity to it, especially with the moba-buys that allow you to counter other vehicles.  I am currently really liking this beta.  It has a great deal of potential and is currently in my daily rotation.  Did I mention it seems to have a healthy player base?  Queue times are usually a few minutes for me.

								Heavy Metal Machines Got bored with it after 2 hours think mainly because not enough players yet and que times are longer than most other games out there.Player and AI teammates vs AI enemiesAI could use some tweaking. eg. Player picks up bomb. AI goes nuts to blow them to pieces. AI picks ups the bomb and they barely do anything. Found I don't even have to do anything and still win 3-0 with all bot players. Has a reasonable learning curve as it's tricky to hit enemies at times and also not cornering into walls and lava. Also like that there is an upgrade menu and currently all vehicles available and unlocked from the start for the open beta. Had zero issues with the game bug wise and enjoyed the comic opening video. Options I wish were in the game is adjusting mouse sensitivity and skipping the cutscenes. Best that you get friends to play with you to reduce PvP que times.   Will update review after some more gameplay			"

								Aside from long matchmaking times, this game has pretty good first impression on me. The art, music, and style come together pretty nicely to make a small, free to play game, feel big. The brawl, bash-em, racing, back and forth action, make this capture the flag-type game exciting and interesting. What will keep me coming back though, is the variety of vehicles and vehicle types. Hopefully matches won't always take 10-15+ minutes to start.Here's my gameplay video if you're curious about how the game feels starting out:

								First, I want to say that's a very good game, but it can be really better.When you are in a game and the other team is taking the bomb, it's very difficult to take back the bomb because whe have too much life.I think it will be better if we have less life or if our attack do more damage.Another things who can be upgraded is the feedback, when I do an attack I don't kown if my attack harm the ennemy or notI know it's an open beta and many things will be change.(I'm sorry if my english is not perfect, it's not my mother tongue)			"

								Very fun, but they haven't implemented an option where you don't have to keep holding the mouse button to drive and I'm getting carpal tunnel heavy set into my wrist cause I keep trying to support noobs so if you're really old or know you have wrist problem then stay safe.			"

								Is a recent game, released on January 31, and it has a lot of potential, if more people start playing it the game will certainly have a great impact, it's like dota2 / LOL with cars, but much more fun and not so Competitive, which ends up being good			"

								When I first played I was kinda skeptical. I usually dont like vehicular combat games, but as I got into the story an d character bios I was hooked. The gameplay grew on me more and more after each match. What I loved most was the crazy cast of characters. It ranges from a little girl in a monster truck (Little Monster) to a revenge fueled ghost indian lady (Windrider). I look forward to this games future content.			"

								I think this game could have been pretty sweet if not for the extremely long Accolades/replays/etc. My immersion was destroyed.			"

								Heavy Metal Machines Got bored with it after 2 hours think mainly because not enough players yet and que times are longer than most other games out there.Player and AI teammates vs AI enemiesAI could use some tweaking. eg. Player picks up bomb. AI goes nuts to blow them to pieces. AI picks ups the bomb and they barely do anything. Found I don't even have to do anything and still win 3-0 with all bot players. Has a reasonable learning curve as it's tricky to hit enemies at times and also not cornering into walls and lava. Also like that there is an upgrade menu and currently all vehicles available and unlocked from the start for the open beta. Had zero issues with the game bug wise and enjoyed the comic opening video. Options I wish were in the game is adjusting mouse sensitivity and skipping the cutscenes. Best that you get friends to play with you to reduce PvP que times.   Will update review after some more gameplay			"

								Aside from long matchmaking times, this game has pretty good first impression on me. The art, music, and style come together pretty nicely to make a small, free to play game, feel big. The brawl, bash-em, racing, back and forth action, make this capture the flag-type game exciting and interesting. What will keep me coming back though, is the variety of vehicles and vehicle types. Hopefully matches won't always take 10-15+ minutes to start.Here's my gameplay video if you're curious about how the game feels starting out:
