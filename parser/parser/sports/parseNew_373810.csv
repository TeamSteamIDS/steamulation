												While it's a Fun Pinball game to enjoy and play, it contains 3 SFW Adult Tables: Car Wash, Moulin Rouge & Beach.			"

												Quite a simple yet enjoyable Pinball game.  Not the best but for the price it's worth giving it a go if your into pinball games.			"

												The WORST ever.As an owner of EVERY FX2 and The Pinball Arcade table, this is just SO bad.Bad design, dreadful layout, horrible physics. Three tables, less than 35 MB.Just DON'T!(Obviously I HAVE played 5 minutes, or this review wouldn't be accepted.....OK?) "

												I've  loved pinball, both the real mechanical ones and  computer simulations for as long as I can remember. This together with the other two  games in the  Thrills  set (not to be confused with the excellent 3-D Ultra Pinball Thrillride by Sierra Entertainment) are  the worst pinball games I've ever played.  The Steam description says:'They are the ultimate joy for fans of action packed arcade rounds. Thanks to state-of-the-art technology youâ€™ll experience a premium physics simulation. Amazingly detailed, right down to realistic reflections, this game delivers the most intense pinball experience.' What a load of twaddle, though  to be fair, the physics simulation is about right (apart from the ball feeling sluggish at times).  There's little animation, most of the targets, of which there are  only a few on each table are  mainly boring and static.  You'd be much better investing in Pinball Arcade or Pinball FX. Both of those games   have a free table. Just watch the video on  the Steam shop page for Hot Pinball Thrills and compare it to  the  ones I mention above. Basically  all thee tables are   similar, with little of interest  in  any one of them.  Apart from  what I've already mentioned above,  you can't control the initial ball strength, there appears to be no  additional features or hidden  puzzles,  the ramps, rails and switches are  similar throughout not only this set, but  the whole series of 12 tables (from 3 games).   There are no or little in the way of  lighting effects around the  targets, The graphics are not  what you'd expect from a game created in 2015. This series of tables is  a turn off for me and I very much doubt I'll ever play it again.  I cannot recommend this game, even to pinball aficionado's.  If you are determined to buy the game   I'd seriously   wait till its on sale before you waste your money.   I'm sure it will be on sale  soon, once  the  negative reviews stack up, and sales dry up.   I don't like knocking games because I think the work that goes into them is intense, with  many working hours  going into the creation of even the simplest of games; unfortunately for me this game (and the others in the series), were a real disappointment.I will be writing separate reviews for the other two sets in the series, but they will  not be very different from this one  as they use the same basic targets, the same ramps, the same  bumpers etc. The main difference is the art work and slight changes to the look of the tables.

												Middle-of-the-road budget pinball game, part of a series which also includes football- and fantasy-themed sets. The problem is not so much that it offers three tables - that's already more than the likes of Worms Pinball offer - but that the tables on offer are really not very good. Hitting ramps - the most basic thrill of a game of pinball - is so rare as to be a happening, and most of the rest of the time, the ball just flounces around not hitting a whole lot of stuff. The physics don't help matters, as the ball and flippers feel heavy and wooden, rather than smooth, as should be the case in a computerised pinball simulation. The rest of the game is equally as unremarkable - the soundtrack is limited to a single, Z-tier Playboy Channel soundalike, while table graphics revolve around the sort of imagery no one over the age of 15 will really be enticed by. What a mature gamer is left with is an extremely pedestrian, if competent, pinball simulation - good to kill 10 minutes, but instantly discardable the minute something better is available. Much like Playboy magazine itself, actually... Not a hearty disrecommendation, but a thumbs-down nonetheless. If you're after a solid, budget pinball title, seek out Dream Pinball 3D instead.Best table: Car WashWorst table: Moulin Rouge (good luck getting more than 2.5 million or so on that one, even if you're a veteran PC pinball player!)

												Like the other two pinball thrills releases, this is a PROPER release for the PC.Resolution Options? CheckController Options? CheckThe game has a user friendly UI and plenty of user defined graphic options that the average Steam PC user has come to expect and will appreciate their inclusion here.The camera options are more than sufficient and the game runs without any lag or choppiness.You get 3 tables which are ALL original designs and each has a sort of SEXY GIRLS motif. These tables are NOT rules-deep and play more as a fine time waster than anything else.The physics. Low gravity and a very live ball that reminds me of Full Tilt meets Original Future Pinball and once you get comfortable, you can have a FUN game of pinball.This is worth the normal price of $3.99, and if you find it on sale, GRAB IT, you could do a lot worse.

												Be sure to use number keys for camera angle, I prefer 4.It's old PC school style pinball like from the 1990's.Slower more leisurely pace then the realistic pinball sims.If you hate that, pass, but it's not horrible for a few bucks at all.foofaraw is biased!    LOLZaccaria Pinball is an awesome new realistic pinball also worth your time/$. "

												Disclaimer:  I am a 41 year old guy,  and I bought this game simply for the pinball experience, if you can call it that, AND NOTHING ELSE!OVERALL RATING:  1/2 a star at best honestlyHot Pinball Thrills - $3.99People who wish to claim they put this out: UIG Entertainment, Reactor, Fancy BytesConsists of 3 Tables (Carwash, Moulin Rouge, and Beach) with 5 Balls per play.Played on an i-7, 16 GB RAM, Nvidia GTX 1070 8GB RAM, 2 TB 7200 RPM HDDPositives: The Game didn't crash on me and no venereal disease can be trasmitted through the gameplay, thank god!Negatives (Hold on to your hats folks): At entrance of the game the music is rather repeditive and honestly degrading to women as a while with ""Giggles"" throughout and ""Kiss me Baby"" references throughout the song.Carwash - A very poorly designed table with unimaginative play and a ball the in my opinion looks unreal and feels horrible to play (physicswise).  I am fairly confident the developers of this game had a beer in one hand and rhyming dictionary in the other as this table has the most pathetic design I have EVER seen in a table. Girls voices tell you ""I love you"" when the ball is lost (quite regularly I may add) and honestly just like the other tables they are misogynistic in design.Moulin Rouge - Likewise a very poorly designed table, and game play, has the same music as the other machines, no creativity to me really (kinda feel sorry for the artist as he did the best he could I feel witht he material he was working with). As many of my pinball compatriots can tell you, just steer clear of this ""Hot mess"" (feels cheapened saying somethign that cheesy whil trying to write a serious review of this flaming bag of poo).Beach - Ugh........lets just leave it at that....oh look a lighthouse........is that another mysoginistic reference to the male anatomy again?1?!? You can decide for yourself.....but why really.In all I guess it is what you would expect from a company that is proud to put out ""Professional Simulators"" ...... AHEM.Love yourself, dont buy this product.....ever!Darkendone{LDH}			"

												Well I think this game is ok and acceptable, maybe because i havent really played many pinball games before. the game seems a bit stretched on my monitor and i hope it can be fixed. I will recommend it if it's on special.			"

												This is a pretty cool Pinball game with 3 themes. Controls are easy and gameplay is fun, graphically the game is very nice with the pinball looking quite fluid and realistic.  If you're a fan of pinball games give it a go.			"

												This is an OK pinball game.  I recommend it only for those who are not pinball snobs though and only on sale.  This Pinball Thrills pack also has some .. entertaining voice effects, as in ""You are sexy"".  Well thankyouverymuch.  :$Non-proportional stretching of the item models on my widescreen appear to make things look slightly squished vertically, ball physics are definitely off, the music is very repetitive after a bit, and the ball is fairly dark in this one for some reason.  The 3 tables included seem to include minimal modes and mini-games so, no, it's not comparable to Real Arcade or Pinball FX 2, so just be aware of that up front.  That said, the controls work well for keyboard and 360 gamepad, and it even has one feature that the big boys don't: you can enter your highscore name with the keyboard.  Maybe they could learn something from this after all.  :)			"
