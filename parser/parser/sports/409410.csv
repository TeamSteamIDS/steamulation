								Actually a very decent game. Really cool to play with friends. There is a lot of possibility for map making. You can build a racing or platform track to compete agaisnt your friends. The developer is actually listening the players too and it's amazing. I hope you will add more game mode.			"

								Hilarious and fun, but noone's playing.  The only way you can play is with friends, or ♥♥♥♥ around by yourself.  It seems the devs might have abandoned this one, and I can't blame them, I check on it every now and again and I haven't seen a single server since I bought it.			"

								Beautiful Game! Run's smoothly, community based game where the developer actually listen and adds suggestions the community talk about.Custom Moose Skins made by the community is such an amazing feature! #GreatGame #WorthItI've supported the developer all the way till now and I will continue to do so, I am happy this has been released on steam as you too will be able to witness the greatest I am witnessing! <3			"

								Good game, just not as active as most games, but still unique that it allows access to make maps for parkour and obsticle courses also arenas, because it also allows access to total of 6 guns, my only hope is that in future it will get more noticed and gets more content like more guns, and hopfully a completely flat area to make map building easier.

								Hi guys I just want to start with this game by saying it is top laugh.... I am a left handed player and can not wait for keybindings options but there is a lot of great things about this game.... make your own parkour track or a dirty junior kickstart track (for the old skool lads) but lots to do. I even have my own face loaded up on the game adding a great touch.... I hoope to see you out there in MOOSE land			"

								My first review ever, just because this game (and the developer) so deserve it. For some reason the game has not gotten much traction which is sad considering how much work must have gotten into it. The whole thing is surprisingly polished and there's already a lot of fun to be by just playing whatever content has been already implemented, even if going solo. Considering the setting and the hilarious tone of the game one can only wonder what kind of cool stuff could be implemented in future, basically only the creativity is the limit, but of course to make it worthwhile that will require more people to find the game. Here's hoping that will happen!			"

								OMG this game! So freaking funny. Nothing else matters, I haven't eaten in a weeks. My girlfriend left me yesterday..but it's worth it! The strongest point of this game is that you can test your level even if you friends is building it. There is no limit on the map size. I really like the funny atmosphere. Go talk to Suspicious Moose and he will give you the tools to edit the map. You can use your own custom skin in-game (Mine was my friend's head). Absolutely recommended! 1000 / 10 IGN			"

								Tried playing it with my friend. Wasn't worth the money at all. Maybe this game will go somewhere eventually, and I hope so, but right now there's really no instruction on what to do and seems pretty pointless. And I don't mean pointless as in you just do random stuff. I mean as in literally there seems to be nothing to do. I would not recommend spending money on it at this point.			"
