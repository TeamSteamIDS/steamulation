												My favourite racing sim for years. A must have for any racing sim and classic car fans.Community still alive and kicking, plenty of mods around.For online racing, your best bet is to find a group that has scheduled events. I race(d) at racedepartment.com, great guys there. Even got a few poles and wins; every single one of them in the Mini :D			"

												A huge THANK YOU to whoever had a part in bringing this amazing game and the GTR games to Steam - you deserve a standing ovation.If you missed this classic gem and have ANY interest or appreciation of racing sims, now is the time to get it. GT Legends and GTR 2 are still as good as every other racing game available, and for my 2 cents the only games that top them are still being made. The initial package brings a lot to the table but the daunting collection of cars and tracks from the sim-racing community available makes it an absolute must-have. This is racing...  get in it			"

												This is the sim racer I have been looking for, good selection of classic cars from small fiats to big american muscle. Has a decent selection of tracks, ai drivers are a decent challenge where they will try pass other drivers in smart places and not just push you off the track like a horny moose.The biggest thing for me is that this game has great driving physics. Cars handle like you think they would. When you drive a small front wheel drive car you notice how nimble it is through the corners and has very little understeer and the bigger american muscle cars feel heavy with lots of torque. There are close to 100 different cars and you unlock them as you play through the career. You can adjust almost everything on them either with simple sliders for oversteer/understeer, stiffness and ride height to more advanced setup where you can change camber and so on.Graphics are ok with decent textures and nice lighting effects for the time. Exterior damage modelling is very minimal but collisions do feel like they have some weight to them even though sometimes side to side collisions can feel a bit akward, but still you can push cars and make them spin. Very playable with older hardware and newer aswell. Also supports 21:9 aspect ratio monitors. Driving feels nice even with a gamepad, though oversteer can be difficult to control with such sensitive controls. I would recommend a good FFB wheel with this. I have not personally tested how it is with a wheel but support for all kinds of wheels and controllers are there and are very configurable with sensitivity, dead zones and so on. (I will try to add my thoughts later on about how it feels with a wheel since at the moment I don't have a good place to install my Fanatec CSR wheels, pedals and shifter.) My favorite moments from the game are when you are playing the ""david vs goliath"" on career mode where you have to drive with a small and not too powerfull Lotus Cortina against big muscle cars like The Mustang. In the straightaways you get passed easily but if you carry lots of speed through the corners you can almost oversteer past them.The game is very moddable, nogrip and other forums has a ton of beatifully modelled cars and tracks, period correct of course.

												Game is perfect, no other word for it. It has everything going for it, there's not 1 bad thing about this game. 1) Cockpit view is amazing.2) Night time racing is awesome.3) Night time racing in a convertible with cockpit view is one of the best experiences i've had in a racing game.4) Night time racing in a black Chevrolet Corvette in cockpit view (windscreen is incredibly narrow) is absolute boss. Unbelievably good.5) The endurance races (20/60 laps) don't feel like endurance races because every second is great.5) The handling is perfect. The cars don't feel like a yacht, but you can't just throw them around either. It is balanced perfectly.6) Moving up in cars is great. Going from a Lotus Cortina, to a Ford Mustang, to a Chevrolet Corvette, to a Ford GT is great.  The speed difference is notable in each jump, and the engine noises, especially from Cortina to Mustang, is awesome.7) Physics are crazy. You can easily flip or roll the car, but that adds to the fun. 8) No popularity simulator single player crap like most modern racing games have, just simple trophies.9) Great selection of cars and tracks.

This is one for your racing collection if only for the lovely period cars and the masses of available addons, tracks and mods, and its thriving mod community (sadly no steam workshop).  There are online races, but you'll have to look through the game forums for details. pretty good physics and despite its age nice graphics (after all its a racing game, so what goes on in your peripheral vision doesn't have to tax a graphics card).

												Intro/Graphics: If you love old cars (or just cars) and challenging racing, this is for you. This game is from 2005, so the graphics are outdated, although that doesn't bother me. I find the tracks and landscape suffer the most, but the cars themselves look great! The lighting is particularly good on the cars and everywhere else. You can race anytime of day, and night races are fun (I always end up breaking a headlight tho *oops*). Though, you cannot race in the rain unlike GTR2, however this is okay because driving these 60s/70s cars in the rain would be a struggle.Controls/Difficulty: I got this game a long time ago before I was even old enough to fit in a driver's seat (much to the disdain of the elder British lads that I wrecked in multiplayer long ago), but I enjoyed it oh so much. If you are playing it with a keyboard, good luck racing on professional or semi-pro mode. With a keyboard, you pretty much need traction control, automatic shifting, and anti-lock brakes, therefore you can only be competitive on amateur difficulty. If you have a wheel and pedals and a shifter, then it'll be awesome, especially if you have a clutch pedal and H shifter. There's really no need to play on novice or beginner difficulty unless you really are new to racing games or are just a young kid. (Fun fact: it took me until this year to learn how to pit, however you won't really need to until the endurance races)Physics/Realism: The driving physics are rather good. The crashes are very unrealistic however and it's very easy to flip your car and roll about five times before landing on your roof (and still being able to drive afterwards). Glitches are pretty fun, as well. Gameplay: You go through a career mode where you race from 2 to 8 circuits per event and accumulate points and win a trophy if you finish between first and third in points at the end. You start with a Mini and a Lotus Cortina and race up to faster cars (Mustang, Elan, Corvette, Pantera, 911... etc.) by either winning them or earning enough credits to buy new (old) cars. You also unlock more tracks along the way. I haven't played multiplayer in such a long time, but back in the day I used to joyride in my Ford Falcon on the grass & dirt (on purpose) at Donington Park. The Europeans loved me.tl;dr ~You can drive (wreck) cars that are now worth millions!			"

												Good: This game was released 2005 and it's still good in year 2014. Graphics? not up to par by todays standards in any ways but everything else is still golden.  Attention to detail is Simbin quality and i love the nice career mode. No other Simbin game has a proper career mode with unlockable cars and tracks.  Bad: Hard to find anything bad that isn't nit picking or whining about graphics. FPS turns on a dime even on my older rig. Does not record your playing hours correctly though. Steam overlay does not always activate so the real game hours are always understated unless you Alt-tab out after starting the game and check that you are marked as playing the game every time. Also ugly orange colored menus. Like you watch much those anyways...			"

Posted: July 25, 2014
												(REVISED) Some issues with the ""sim""-ness of the game aside, this is one of the most satisfying racing games I've played. That's largely in part to the huge mod content available.Compared to the hundreds of cars that games like Gran Turismo and Forza have ballooned into, even the modding community can't offer a comparable volume on that front, but it makes up for that in the quality of many of the car liveries (or ""skins"") and sheer volume of race tracks. You won't find a console racing game or many PC ones that offer the volume of race tracks you can download for GT Legends (and presumably its sister games, too). At the moment, I have more than 100 tracks installed, and there are lots more available. Not only can you find different tracks from around the world, and a few made-up ones, but some classic tracks -- such as Le Mans, Spa, Monaco, Nurburgring, and others -- offer some of their various incarnations over the years. In short, I've never seen a racing game offer more opportunites to race the tracks you've always wanted to race.The visual quality of the tracks varies, some looking plain and dated, with textures like roads and trees looking painful old in some, but pleasantly realistic in others. This is also true for the creativity of the ""fantasy"" tracks, some a little bland, but others achieve what they advertise very well, like the ""Moorlands"" track looking like it came right out of Wuthering Heights.Besides the mods, the game offers suprisingly good-looking cars and still some of the most impressive natural-light effects, particularly at dawn and dusk and how the light looks on the cars.The ""sim"" aspect is also mixed. Having never raced real cars (much less any like these old ones), I can only compare the sim authenticity to my instincts and the closest game equivalent I've played -- namely, Forza. It feels a little overcooked in parts, with certain physics seeming oversensitive, like the grass and sand feeling more like ice; some cars getting lost in a slide that renders counter (or any) steering ineffective; cars flip too easily and overreact to some contact; some cars' inability to hold a straignt  line under braking. Not only do they feel overdone, but vindictively so, too often pushing it beyond challenge into unbearable irritation. In short, while some of the over/understeer and other physics are impressive and satisfying, there seem to be just as many elements that make this as aggravating as often as it can be fun.Perhaps some of the over-fidgityness of the cars are avoided by using a racing wheel instead of a controller, like I'm using (PS3), which also doesn't recognize any rumble/feedback.Also vexing, on the single player side is the poor balancing of AI and grid competition, and the relative uselessness of many cars in a mixed grid. That means that the number of actually usable cars -- in terms of being able to win the races on the harder difficulties -- is limited. You are stuck with whatever car you pick for all the races in a particular ""tournament"", so there are really only two or three choices (at most!) to give yourself a realistic chance of winning on pro or semi-pro. I imagine you can find (or create) online one-make races, though, that would allow you to drive all these nice classic rides.Ultimately, the well-aged visuals, the mixed but overall still adequate sim-racing experience, and the gobs of mod content (most notably, the tracks!) makes this a must-have for  serious racing game fans.

												This is an excellent game for a semi-professional / amateur-enthusiastic player.This is the game closest to a real simulator among all I played. The cars are responsive but not unrealistically, react to bumps on tracks, the speed is about average, there is room for minor mistakes but not too much. There is even some randomisation, tire sets have different behaviour a little bit (most noticeable in Monza). There is a possibility to tune (balance) your car to some extent, but you can get along without it.GT Legends is one of the few games supporting long races (up to 60 laps, 2-3 hours), which I find incredibly fun. Also night driving. I bought this not much after seeing a bit of Le Mans in 2013. This was the first game in which I actually enjoyed being in the middle of the pack.The graphics are somewhat simple but overall very well done, the effects scale nicely with the resolution (so the cars look nice) and trackside trees are lush enough. I love the distant mountains, the night sky with the moon and the darkest hours, the morning / evening sun overbright.There are no weather effects, unlike in its predecessor (GTR 1), either for performance reasons (back then) or the fact that cars are slippery enough. Lighting is pretty cool, works well for night races - not to forget the lamp posts and light in various buildings.Used to play it in 2013/2014 without problems on a GTX 560 Ti, but on my new GTX 970 Ti it kept crashing. Got better over the months, but there are still some momentary freezes.Administrator mode (or some tinkering with security settings) is required.The only downside I would mention is how the progression feels slow. Tracks unlock by completing short championships in the top 3, cars must be purchased with championship earnings. Cash can be farmed, but if you get distracted by custom races or an obsession to run races at a tougher difficulty, well...Given its price, I'd say it's a bargain. Pick it up, have fun for a few hours, be prepared to get hooked.			"

												This game is difficult to enjoy with just a keyboard but If you have a racing wheel this is a must play racing game. It is a very different experience than other simbin titles, it doesn't have the speed of GTR 2 or the emphasis on bumper to bumper racing of RACE 07 but the cars are far more interesting and more challenging to drive. If you've ever wanted to powerslide a shelby cobra...There are a couple weaknesses such as no variable weather conditions and very limited graphical damage modeling  but this is still my favourite racing game.

												This is a tremendous bargain as far as racing sims go.  The simulation aspect is very good with true to life physics and car performance.  A credible career mode which allows you to save credits and by more cars to add to your collection adds to the interest.  The graphics are old but still quite functional and do give you a realistic view of the track.  This sim works great with a Logitech G27 Racing Wheel, shifter and pedals.			"

												10/10(In consideration of its price)This one is available on♥♥♥♥♥and costs only 2bucks! Playing with my G27, to be honest, force feed back is mediocre however how it is like course surface, self-alining torque on front wheels and G-forces are tangible.So I don't think this is big con. Handling is more similar to racing games not hardcore simulators, Still it is important to drive with sim-like manners such as delicate braking and taking care of weight transfering in vehicle. Graphics, ofcourse this game doesn't looks fabulous in conparison of games these days.This is 10 years old title, how can I blame this outstanding title for such things?This one has undying racing joy even 10 years after released !

												Decided to uppdate the review of the game to look a bit better ;3 Okey, why is this game good? well.. for once this game got me into racing games. I started playing this game at the age of 5 thanks to my father. he bought one of those Microsoft Sidewinder FB wheels to use with the game. i spent days just watching my father play this game for hours. untill i asked if i could test play. sure i was short so i could not reach down to the pedals so i had to use the buttons on the steering wheel. it was hard i got to admit at the age of 6-8 i could finnaly reach down to the pedals and be able to drive the cars in manual. i spend thousands of hours into the game. i beated the game on every diffeculty at that point my father bough one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computers you got from work. and bough a second copy of the game and another wheel. for him. and we decided to go head to head on each other. he was always faster and always better then me. so i decided to skip school... just to be able to beat him in the game. it was a bad idea really bad idea. but i did beat him. with the legendary Ford GT40. that is where i fell in love with cars. my dream back then was to get my self a GT40 but yea guess where that dream went. however the game features alot of old school cars like BMW, De Pantera, Ford, Jaguar, Abarth, Ferrari, Porsche. now you might ask. ""Why the ♥♥♥♥ is this dude talking about all of this?"" well... the answer is. i grew up with this game. i have spent more hours into this game then i have spent on any game in my steam library combined. (dont let the steam time fool you. this was before it was on steam) the game comes with 16 diffrent car manufactures. 11 tracks + short version or long versions. the game allows modding to any part. The online community is still alive and kicking but you need to play in a group. or just have LUCK that someone is still having a public server open. But why do i acctualy rekommend the game? well... take it like this... there are not many games that takes you back to the 1960s and 1970s most games today are just about graphics and DLC's. this game dont give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about that. NO DLC's pure Simulator game. the engine might be outdated and the physics in the game might be ♥♥♥♥ing dumb somtimes. but it's a great game. the ai's are acctualy tough and will do anything just to get to first place. even if it means that they have to push you off the track... Sadly the game DO lack some features. like blue flag. black flag. yellow flag. you dont have the options to change the settings in the game. like the diffeculty of the AI. if you choose proffesional you will have hard ai's no matter what. the game are missing some cars that was in the 60 and the 70 racing with these classes. but there is mods out there that adds those cars. i higly rekommend atleast test the game (downloading illegaly or borrowing a friends copy) and the sound in the game is just PURE porn. the corvette C2 sounds just pure amazing. i do rekommend playing trough the game vanilla BEFORE you start modding it.

												This is a game I would highly recommend to any sim racing fan.Just the sound and feel of the cars gives it great immersion most racing games lack these days.It may not look as eye-wateringly gorgeous compared to todays standards, you don't enjoy a game by looks alone; they are simply a bonus. But for a game over a decade old it looks and feels pretty damn good for its' age.And let's not forget to mention the enormous modding community still throwing out incredible tracks, cars, championships etc. with great attention to detail!If your tastes don't sway to classic cars, try GTR2! Both games are second-to-none!(For some reason steam only shows I've played this game for 0.2 hrs. I'd say close to the figure of 100+)			"

												The racing game I always return to.Whether it is starting from the back of a full grid of easy AI or trying to make it to the end of a full length endurance race there is much fun to be had here.The variety of cars makes this my favourite of all SimBins games, GTR2 would be a close runner up, anything after that doesn't come close.If you are familiar with any of the ISI engine games you will know what to expect from the handling, the attention to detail for each of the cars interiors means you will want to own and try them all - its up to you if you want to earn the money to buy them or use the savegame trick to unlock them for nothing.

												Usually I write reviews only сompleted the game, but for this game, I will make an exception. At the last cup you have to drive 60 laps on it very much and the only one track will take about 2.5 hours. I can not praise or recommend this game. Because for me it's nostalgia, I remember buying a box with 4CD-disk inside and could not get any runs, because I do not know how to shift gears :) For the time the game is not bad, it was a very good simulator.Also I do not understand why I have five minutes in the game.

												I've been playing this for awhile now, i am not sure the exact amount of hours, as it won't display the exact amount of hours i've docked up in game time because this game like other older game titles in my library, don't like to cooperate 100% with steam. But the game works, in case that sentence threw you off. I'm writing this review because i've just had it with the handling of the cars. It is just appauling; some of you may like it maybe, but i remember reading through reviews and hearing that other players of this game disagreed with the handling in it. I think i recall trying awhile ago to fix this in the options menu, but it made little to no difference. It is just, appauling, the handling that you must endure while driving. That is my biggest, and only complaint of this game; but with that said, it is such a dealbreaker for me, and has reason to be so, that it has just put me off playing it. The game is like any other racing game i suppose. You have a career mode, a quick race mode and a multiplayer mode. I think that i have done one quick race in my gametime; havn't seen the point of it because i have currently, as of typing this review, not finished the career mode (ultimately due to the handling of the car and me rage quitting.) Multiplayer i havn't bothered with, not interested and i doubt that there would be any servers if it all ones that i can join with a good ping for a smooth game.Career mode is basically what it always is; you start off with one of the lesser cars and must progress through the races earning money varying on what position you finish in, obviously the closer you are to first, the more money you finish with. With that money, you can save up to buy other, better cars to race in. The race tracks are of real race tracks. Often, especially at the end of a stage/chapter, you are limited to a certain type of car, so you need to take that into account when spending for a newer race car.The cars you race in are from the 60's through to the 70's; i don't see the logic in listing all of them down, cause if you want to know what cars you drive, just look at screenshots or search the internet. But the cars are the classics from those two decades containing, British, American and European cars.What's the AI like? Annoying. Annoying in the sense that, when they ram into me: i flip all over the damned place, land upside down and need to wait what feels like 10 seconds to flip over again. I ram into them (usually cause im♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that they rammed into me and i flipped and what not) : i flip all over the damned place, land upside down and need to wait what feels like 10 seconds to flip over again. Now that for me gets pretty frustrating; though not as much as the handling, which as i said, was the ultimate deal breaker.I don't want to recommend this game, mostly due to the poor handling as i've stated. It just got so unbearable for me. If you are going to buy it; it's an older game, not much people are going to be playing multiplayer, there are certainly other games with the same type of racing. Do me a favour and if you are going to buy it, get it when it's on sale for a cheap price.Maybe you'll have a different experience that i have had, but i've rage quitted enough to due the handling and AI flipping me over that i just have to warn you weary buyers. Other people have disagreed with the games handling like i have, yet some have said its fine.Just promise me, if this review hasn't thrown you off, get it when it is on sale and is cheap.			"

												Worth 2USD price, but demands a wheel. Pretty, great cars+music, backed by community content, but poor personal experience.-Downloaded tracks were inaccessible (grayed-out). Broken control-stick sensitivity (adjusting did nothing). Cars felt like traction control was off (even with assists). Bugs: HUD did not work, turn-assist indicator was wrong many times, showing wrong gear to be in, appearing too early/late or not at all. Controller (Logitech F310) might explain sensitivity issues, but these GT cars felt like muscle cars. Getting on brakes with any seriousness at times felt like I was driving on bald tires.Suggestions: 1-Get a wheel  2-Download car tuning files 3-Drive conservatively 4-Practice like hell; the AI is on railsFeel let down by reviews; Don't have much PC racing experience, but this seems overrated. This is what you would have called a rental game, one weekend and then tossed in the return bin.			"

												Let’s start out with two points:-For the basis of this discussion, Dictionary.com defines ‘simulation’ as: -The representation of the behaviour or characteristics of one system through the use of another system, especially a computer program designed for the purpose.It defines ‘arcade’ as:-An establishment, public area, etc., containing games of a mechanical and electronic type, as pinball and video games, that can be played by a customer for a fee.I would say with a fair amount of certainty that the sim-racing community does not use these definitions when labelling racing games under one of these two categories. So how do sim-racers see the difference? Well you can only find out by asking, so I did. Here are only a few responses…			"

												If your a big fan of GTR2, GTR Evo, Race 07 or even rFactor, this is a MUST BUY. I've had this game since 2005, and I still adore it to this day, the magic of this game is still alive and well for me. All of the cars handle beautifully, tons of fun to drive, drifting around corners and on the limit. The wide range of cars you can choose from is fantastic as well, from your Mini Coopers to your Porsche 911's. And if that isn't enough, there's a great deal of mods you can choose from as well on various websites! Career mode is awesome as well, plenty to do and bags of fun. Only flaw I'd say with this game is that the AI can be derpy sometimes on a select few of tracks. ie Imola with the tyres. But about 80% of the time, there fine. 9/10.			"

												This one's pretty easy to recommend, if you have a steering wheel this is a must have title, simple as that, if you don't you should probably let it pass as you wont be able to enjoy it very much.Based on the gmotor engine (same other SimBin titles, but with this one being the only one to feature an actual single player career), physics are very realistic (and considering you are driving classic cars with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tyres, it's particularly fun to drive).All cars feel different, with great force feedback and accurate, predictable reactions.Graphics hold up surprisingly well, and the sound simply rocks.Great title, fantastic car selection, fun driving, what's more to like?

												Simbin are kings of the proper race simulator - as opposed to the arcade type of racing game.  The realism is astounding; the whole experience immensly satisfying on all of their offerings up to and beyond the Race 07 series. This early game set the standard and is one of the most satisfying, especially as you have to compete to access all of the types of cars - a huge range of 1960's / 70's touring and GT classics. The dynamics, each one handles differently and requires simple chassis adjustment to get the best result, and the bespoke engine sounds,  are sublime.  I waited 6 years for GT Legends to be released on Steam and it was well worth the wait. And don't think about playing it without a decent wheel. I use the Logitech G27, which does a excellent job of handling the force feedback and responds well to driver input. Start on beginner and graduate to amateur level. The semi and pro levels require a skill level above most users I suspect, at least that was the case with me.			"

												If you like old racecars you should definatively get this game and you can even drive it with a gamepad like me.The only things that I don't like about this game is that the AI doesn't seem to be fully optimized, in training and qualification they seem to have more grip, accelleration and brakingpower than you will ever have but during race they're all of a sudden slower also the damagemodel leaves a lot to be desired.

												Very cool game! Love the sounds of the cars! Quite realistic, the engine sounds vary between each vehicle, the vehicles handle differently - some are quite hard! Visually good too, considering it's an older game. Challenging tracks, awesome vehicle selection. Love the sound of that Mustang!Have the cd version, was able to activate it on steam with the cd code, thanks steam!			"

												Saw this games on steam never heard of it, asked some friends and they said why havent you bought it yet. So I did, took 2-3 hours to setup my wheel and got addicted, super fun driving some classics around some awesome race tracks. Get past the Mini's tho ffb felt really werid, every other car is fine tho. Btw these sounds the pop/backfire of the exhaust, the after rumble just makes driving in this game more addicting. Highly recommend for any sim racer who wants to have fun. I have way more hour's in the game than steam say's btw, for some reason it only counts it for the first minute I have the game up.			"
