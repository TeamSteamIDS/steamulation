												The way of moving strongly made VR sick.and It was hard to go get Ball and I could not proceed to enjoy the game.			"

												I cant even get this game started. I guess you are suppose to put the ball in a net that represents what mode you want to play in, but the problem is that it puts the ball on the floor outside my room scale dimensions so I cant grab the ball. I backed up as far in my room as I could and restarted the game but it still puts the ball outside my room.....this is bad when you cant even get the game started. Don't waste your time on this game!			"
