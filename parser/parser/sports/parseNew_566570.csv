								It's like EA's Skate series in a new medium. Plenty of potential and just the included levels have tons of replayability.			"

								Pretty fun once you start learning how to play, I'd like to see longer maps though too, I've only played for 2 or 3 hours and I am in first place for all 5 maps so I must be pretty good			"

								Backed 100% The developers are genious.  This concept needed to be done in VR, and Hyper Light found an innovative way to make it, not only feel great, but work so smooth!  Please realize how rediculously polished this release is compared the flood of gimics we have these days on Steam.  This is one of those VR games that you can just waste hours in trying to land a flawless line.  I'm not even a skater by any means,  but a big fan of other skating games through the years.  I think this one is honestly the next evolution of those franchises.  EA needs to contact HyperLight and send them a cheque to create a big release with this code.  I have a lot of faith that this is going somewhere in the near future.   Imagine multiplayer!  I can't recommend this one enough.  Not to mention - Those new music tracks are so killer ;) Wish HyperLight the best of luck!!!!			"

								Feels like what you expect with a vr skate game. physics are good controls do take some getting used to but definately feel right when it comes to tricks. sound is good it has some track that are reminscent of old 2d skate games. levels are good but limited atm and fell on the rails, you can only go one way, only suggestion /change id like to see is opening up the levels more and letting people actually go left and right and move more freely in anopen area. when i loaded the school i was expecting to bbe able to skate around the school, not just a stair case in front of it, but early access means this can change and may open up the possibility for more aerial stunts with bowls and half pipes. custimization is great so far and it looks like there is more to come. looking forward to see where this game gos. also this game was free from a raffle but i think its worth the support. theres something with potential here. also to the dev look into vive tracker support with wireless i could see it being a big hit. aka trackers on your shoes			"

Shows lots of promise, already good funWill be updating this short review as the game comes along.Please correct me if there is anything I've missed etc.Great game for Early Access, Developer has talent and seems to give a damn. Support the dev and keep this game going.Pros:++ Impressive for early access. Developer has skills yo.++ Oculus Touch support added+ Graphics are nice and polished, nothing over the top and nothing boring.+ Flip and grind mechanics are great considering the early access stage.+ UI is quite polished, works as good as it looks too (heaps good).Cons:- Needs an 'auto restart on bail' option, better yet a 'get my board back and keep going' button.-- No slow motion option, this would reduce nausea for those affected and also be nice for learning the mechanics.-- Board is very picky about where you place your feet to start, would be better if it were a button instead?

								So far, I really enjoy this game. It has tons of potential, lots of replayability, and active devs.  I have one problem, though. Sometimes, when I would put my hands on the board where they should be, the board would rapidly appear and disappear. This happened a bit often and the only way I found so far to fix it is to exit the game and play it again. So far, that is the only bug I've seen. Keep up the good work!P.S. - If you added workshop support, this game would be beyond cool!			"

								Cool game!  Hard.. but I imagine real skating is too.  I like to try out the edge case games, I think it's important to try out and ask for games out of the norm.  Lots of trial and error (again, real I imagine) but the physics and such feel right.  If you are into skating I imagine you'll like this.  I'll try more later, but wanted to give a positive review because the game delivers as promised.. VR skating with your hands (feet?)			"

								I absolutely dont know what the other positive reviews are talking about, I skate myself and think this game is horrible.- way too short levels, do 1 or 2 tricks and its over- the board is way too floaty, it constantly slips out of your hands by mistake- the tricks arent registered correctly- its all about stupid points....no style no clean landing, nothing, its just crazy flips on end- there is no regular stand.....only goofy, anything else is registered as a switch trick- bail one time during a session and its over, back to a menu and select restart, since you bail so often its annoying as hell- the controls overall are just way too awkwardIts just not enjoyable, like at all. I really like that this is something different, but in the end I think it fails to deliver a fun experience. I absolutely have nothing positive to say about the gameplay.			"
