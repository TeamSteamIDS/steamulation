												I really love this game! It is currently one of my favorites. It plays like a combination on air hockey, tennis, and Arkanoid. The level progression is nice to see as well as being able to upgrade your equipment based on performance from the previous levels. The game does have you face the opposite direction from most others I play on the Vive...but i actually like that better. You do need to have enough room height to play (watch the ceiling), as expected with a tennis type game.  The level design is really cool and varied. The tracking seems perfect on the Vive without any issues at all. Its strange not to see more reviews for this game, its really fun.  Well worth the money.			"

												After about 25+ VR games, I did not think I would find something even more fun than the rest. I am surprised this game is not in the top 10 lists.  I love the gameplay and the visuals on this game.  This is a complete body workout like I get from playing racketball.The one thing you have to be careful is the layout so you don't run into the walls. I had to redo the room scale setup several times to get the play area correct to match the game layout.I wish it would support custom music playlist, also the robot opponents would say something snarky to me when they win.

												This is a great game. The visuals are great and the game play feels real. It is excellent exersize. the three second. The three second count before each serve is really anoyying and breaks up the fun. I wish they would offer an option to keep the ball in play the for the whole game			"
