												I am a long time player of Blood Bowl, starting with the 2nd edition of the tabletop game, through to the nineties MS-DOS computer game, to not-Blood-Bowl-honest Chaos League and finally Blood Bowl 1/Legendary/Chaos. The thing I loved about Blood Bowl 1 was the single player options, from creating a custom league, to participating in a classic competition from Blood Bowl canon, and of course even playing a proper full career, clawing your way up the rankings over the years, up against all the famous classic teams of Blood Bowl lore, winning cups and trophies along the way until eventually, hopefully, winnng the Blood Bowl trophy itself.Now comes Blood Bowl 2; the graphics are prettier, but graphics aren't everything. The part that matters to me, the gameplay, the thing I loved in Blood Bowl 1 is... gone. The single player campaign is a shadow of what it was before. You can create a custom league, but there are no proper tournaments from Blood Bowl canon, and certainly no proper career. You play a few games in a single tournament, and then you are done. And the classic teams don't even appear in these leagues anymore. The whole thing is clearly obsessed with multiplayer, to the point that even in single player games the game still looks, feels and plays just like the multiplayer version, with randomised AI team creations clearly trying to pass themselves off as player teams. But it doesn't work. To take examples, the Broad Axes team might have the emblem of a Bugman's tankard, while Bugman's Faithful might have the emblem of an axe. Eh? It's randomisation gone mad. It makes no sense. And as I said,  there are no Reikland Reivers or Gouged Eye or Chaos All Stars. Unless you play the introductory ""tutorial"", or single one off matches without continuity, you will never see the classic teams of Blood Bowl lore at all. That's just not good enough. For me, without the ability to play a league or proper career with your own team against the classic sides of history, the appeal just isn't there.  And there are other disappointments. You can't improve/modify a player's armour any more. Many of the other options of old just aren't available. The font is -  to my eyes - some horrible thin eyesore - and the UI just ugly, literally not pleasing on the eyes. Meanwhile the commentators Jim and Bob now insist on actually appearing, but just get in the way. In short, while this game might be a multiplayer's paradise, it doesn't work for me. Maybe Blood Bowl 1 spoiled me, but to my mind Blood Bowl 2 is several steps backwards.Now this might sound like I'm some kind of hater. But I am a fan of Blood Bowl and for the sake of the franchise I sincerely hope that people out there are enjoying this, and I wish the game very well. I do want this to succeed. But the single player aspect desperately needs work. The single player game is an opportunity to offer players content that multiplayer content cannot provide - such as a proper career.  But it simply doesn't. For me personally, Blood Bowl 2 is a big disappointment, and until the single player game is improved I will be sticking with Blood Bowl 1, because unfortunately, for solo play, Blood Bowl 1 remains far superior.

												Blood Bowl 2, Learn to salt again.Played several games now and I don't know what to think. It's sure prettier than Chaos Edition (Blood bowl 1, all add-ons), and the client seems more usable. But there is so much in it that just irks me. This product doesn't seem to deserve its price bracket:-Fewer teams, I know more are coming, but I also know they are going to be add on DLC at an as yet unknown price. At Â£35, thas a bitter pill to swallow. It also makes some teams indirectly weaker, with all but one of the current teams being relitively tough, or having easily available tough units, this makes a block/injury focused team less affective.-Lack of assets, there are only 2 spectator models, ork with drum and human in armour. Stadiums are all identicle until leveled up with small differences that have nothing to do with their starting theme. Players have only one model and sometimes an alterable face (per unit type obviously).-Poorly thought out UI. For the most part better than BB1 but with a host of new flaws that I'm hoping will be fixed dispite being identified early in testing and still being there now. For instance, team purchasing, in which you ask players to purchase units without allowing them to pick extras. This means that new players will end up spending all their ingame cash on units without getting vital re-rolls, because re-rolls are purchased later.-Poor single player experience. Yes it is a 2 player board game, but we were promised a decent single player experience. But the ""Campaign"" mode is a drawn out and frackly dull tutorial, while league mode doesn't even attempt to hide the fact that its just a bot game generated at your teams current point value. Combine this with a bafflingly inconsistant AI, and I can't see why I should play this over Chaos Edition right now.			"

												Having put over 150 hours into Blood Bowl 1, and a little over 50  hours into Blood Bowl 2, I think the game is well worth the upgrade. The graphics are better, the UI is vastly superior, and it's far easier for newer players to pick up the game and learn. There was an issue with the end turn button being in an awful place, but that's been fixed.All that said, there are a few downsides. I do wish the DLC had launched with the game, as it seemed to me they marketed it that way. I also wish the league settings and stat tracking were a bit more in depth, but that's something that could get patched in down the line.Overall though, the game is solid, and I've had a ton of fun playing it. Some might say it's not worth the price, but I've played this game far more than a lot of other games I payed the same, or more, for. If you love sports, turn-based strategy, and fantasy, you'll love Blood Bowl 2.			"

												Well, this game is the definition of one step forward, two steps back.So, this is what we get after almost a year of delays. Well, let's get to it, then.Stepping in the right direction:+ Better UI.+ New Race: Brettonians.+ Better Graphics.+ Easy to invite Steam friends to a friendly match of Blood Bowl.Retreading same old footsteps:= The announcers are back, and they are just as fun to listen to.= Solo Old World League is as close as you'll get to the original Campaign.= It's Blood Bowl.= Customization ups the ante with choosing uniform patterns instead of just a single colour, but scales it back again by letting you only change the players' heads.And, of cousre, the backsteps:- No mid-match ""quit and save"" option in single-player, except in the campaign. As clumsy as the old SaveBetweenHalves/Drives->AbandonMatch->QuitWithoutSaving routine was, there was, at least, a way. - The Campaign (Story Mode) is just an extended tutorial utilizing the Reikland Reavers (Human). - Blitz Mode is gone. No more custom gear for you.- Back to 8 teams? Are you joking? Chaos Edition had 23. 23! - No team-specific cheerleaders. Human cheerleaders for everyone!- Very limited graphical options (Resolution, Quality presets, Grass, Spectators). Don't bother. Wait for the Legendary Edition.			"

												An awful let down, the developers haven't listened to what the community wanted. They've delivered a console-centric game that's currently, and likely to remain, inferior to the original version and not a patch on the board game or FUMBBL. The list of disappointments is too long to go into, though amongst the worst offenders are the console-centric cut down options and UI, the AI that (despite devloper claims) is exactly as bad if not worse that in the original, the treacly performance on decent machines, the lack of visible levelling on players, lack of star players and the temerity to change the rules of an established and hugely playtested game.  Suffice to say i've tried to get a refund for this and would not recommend it to anyone in it's current state. "

												DON'T BUY THIS NOW! Wait until the Legendary Edition comes out around about Summer time so that you get ALL DLC included, and the updated version of the game.Really fun game and accurate to the tabletop version. One word of warning for new players though, this is not for you if you can't handle RNG. 95% of this game is dice rolls. Have fun out there :D			"

												So much promise!Played Blood Bowl Legendary edition extensively. All the things I loved about the first one is gone. Now we have:-Clunky menus fit for a console.-Mysteriously vanished options for saving ingame.-No visual progression on your players as they level up-A total lack of faces for your players. Twins or even triplets in your lineup is a must it seems.-Tiny, no info log.-no singleplayer campaign except for the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ tutorial ""campaign"".You done â¥â¥â¥â¥ed it up Cyanide!!!

												Traded out quick gameplay for gimmicky graphical â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. Otherwise it's identical to Blood Bowl I, with most of the races cut out to be sold as DLC and a completely gutted single player campaign.* It's actually a lesser game than its predecessor in every single way other than graphics, and even the UI is klutzy and awkward comparatively.*You can make a league, which is a 40 team elimination tournament. There's an actual Campaign mode, but it's like playing a tutorial for eight thousand games, where your team is selected for you and cutscenes can't be skipped.			"

												So, I can't recommend this game for several reasons. Although Blood Bowl is a really fun blend of strategy and RNG, the implementation of this is poor. Single player is OK - the campaign is just an extended tutorial, and not actually challenging. Although the commentators are mildly entertaining and most games the AI has some gimmick to keep you interested, its clear the game is geared towards multiplayer. Unfortunately, multiplayer is awful. Matchmaking times are ridiculously long, and  the longer you're in queue, the less the game cares about an even matchup. Using petty cash to even out the odds is inadequate to really level the playing field and allow a fair competitve match. Furthermore the game doesn't use MMR - matchmaking is determined by you're teams gold value, not winrate. So player skill isn't taken into account and experienced players with low TV teams destroy any newer players. Also since there's no real incentive to win, and no penalty for conceding, the leagues are infested with Chaos teams whose sole aim is to kill and injure your players. If you try to injure their players back in return, they'll just concede. Also, the main league - NAF - has ageing on for some reason, which is a stupid rule. All your prized players you spend ages levelling up will eventually retire. Other complaints include a shoddy UI, a distinct lack of teams compared to the previosd Blood Bowl, and the devs being very slow to update the game or add new content. They also seem unwilling to actually balance the game, and allow CPOMB teams to run rampant in every league, which is completely anti-fun. The game itself also runs very poorly, with low framerate and really long animations that are unskippable and leave you unable to do anything while the animation plays out. Often you will run out of time each turn because the game runs so badly. Games also last too long - 16 turns each at 2minutes per turn is 1hr 12mins for turn timers, however ONTOP of that is time for animations/cutscenes ansd kickoff/events/injuries. The entire game feels like it needs to be sped up. For the full price its definitely not worth it. If you're a hardcore Blood Bowl fan and don't mind playing against Chaos/Nurgle every match then maybe pick it up on sale.			"

												I was really expecting great things from BB2, but I'm sad to say I'm rather disappointed. I can't give it a positive review for now, even if I hope that if some issues are corrected and more content injected to the game, I will gladly change my review.The Good:- Nice graphics- It's Blood Bowl... It's brutal, it's fun, it's challenging. But well, that's thx to the board game rules, the videogame adds little to that.- Cool multiplayer with permadeath: it adds a sense of danger everytime you play, it's fun.- Cleaner HUD. There has been a lot of complaints about the ""player cards"", but I find it not so annoying, it's rather clear and nice.The Bad:- The campaign is crap: you only play 1 human team, with false rules. It's utterly boring, not worth your time if you already know BB1.- The solo content is mediocre: the solo leagues are just multiplayer leagues but with AI. It all feels too generic for me, games are chained without other things to do inbetween apart from the rare level up. It feels really empty.- No player stats: that's the major complain for me, what's the point of playing games after games when you have no player stats (how many TD, passing, blocking, etc...) and leaderboards between all teams?? That's the basic feature missing that is the cause that I don't want to play anymore: I just don't see the point.- No visual enhancemnent when players level up: it's not major, but the lack of all these little features makes that you don't care for your team players, because they stay the same even if they are Ã¼ber strong.- Games are veeeery long: solo or multi, one game lasts in average 1:30 hours... It's too long! For just one quick game, when you don't have that much time to play anymore, you know you must reserve 2h of your time to play just a little game...- In solo, you can't speed up turns like you could in BB1: it made the whole thing a lot less repetitive.- The commentaries from Jim & Bob become repetitive very quick.The Good to Have:- It's not major, but watching the same hit animation over and over when you block someone become really dull after a while, considering that you block A LOT during a match. I would have launched this animation only on big hits like injuries.- Where are the women? There's only 1 female player type + the duplicates pom pom girls. A strong lack of variety here, it's not made to help making women play this kind of games...- Eye candy: different pom pom for each race, a real spectating crowd, etc... What I don't understand too, is why making a big solo campaign with a lot of animation and what not, but for kick-off events you just have one poor line of text where you could have cool animations? (like, spectators trampling players...)SO that's that, my major complaint is that in solo, the content is very thin and don't want to make you take care about your team and see it to the top, and in multiplayer it's good but the matches are very, very long so it's a strong barrier, for me at least.Hope the game will be updated and devs will listen to the community! It can become very cool.			"

												Blood Bowl is an amazingly fun and deep tactical and persistent tabletop board game. It's the Warhammer races playing american football against eachother, what's not to love? I've been a huge fan of blood bowl in one form or another (BBCE, FUMBBL, tabletop) since 2010 (over 3000 matches played), but Blood Bowl 2 is the one that really brings it home for me. The excellent modeling and animation work give a much more powerful feel to the game than any other form ever has.Be advised that Blood Bowl is a multiplayer game first and foremost. If you get into the game (and you should!), be sure not to spend too much time in single player mode. The 'campaign' is basically a tutorial, slowly introducing game concepts to you. If you want to get playing quickly, you are probably better off looking for youtube videos (cKnoor has a good set of tutorials for the basic rules, and for more advanced gameplay help you can check out my channel)When you do go to multiplayer (and you should!), it's worth noting that the 'main' non-competitive ladder has a fairly low standard of play. People there will concede matches a LOT. If you do not enjoy this, then you can join the champion ladder. While this is competitive, losing matches there will not result in a reduction of your rank as a coach, you can always start over fresh with a new team. Be advised that anyone who concedes more than 5 matches in a season (which last 6-9 weeks so far) across all his teams gets kicked from the champion ladder, so if you want the right to give up and stop playing a match, then this is not the place for you. The real heart of blood bowl 2 lies in its scheduled league play. There are dozens of great leagues around, and if you can commit to scheduling and playing a game per week, then leagues are the way to go.Be advised that when you are new to the game, it is often difficult to tell the difference between someone minimizing risks better, and someone rolling better dice. Blood Bowl is renowned for people cursing at 'Nuffle' (the dice god) for their terrible luck, but with insight and learning, this is truly a skill-based game at heart.Blood Bowl is an amazingly fun, deep, tactical, persistent game, and Blood Bowl 2 makes it gorgeous too!See you on the pitch. =)the Sage			"

												The game is ok, but give it time to stew this game still requires more work and its slightly over priced for what its worth, pick it up on a sale etc but for now i would not recommend this game. Underneath i put some points i liked and dislikedother players are voicing their issues with the game on the discussion boards i'd like to point this one out as being a really good example with problems in the current build http://steamcommunity.com/app/236690/discussions/0/523897204944724525/The goodThe UI is much better than the previous game displaying the percentage chance on rolls and popping up cards showing the stats of the characters in question are really nice and easy to understand.The commentators are on point with great witty banter.The musics good.The not so goodThe animations are pretty sweet but still very limited, seeing your teams march out at halftime with a low camera is an epic sight to see but there is not much difference in the way characters tackle, so each time your characters makes a tackle regardless of who is around and what direction they're coming from the tackle is the same. Goblins do tackle different from humans etc, but as pointed out, the goblins tackle is its only tackle with no variaton.The graphics have improvmed on the original although not by that big of a deal. Its 2015, the game looks to be on par with Dawn of war 2 and other games that came out about 5 years ago, not a big deal for me still id of liked it to be better.The badThere arent that many teams on launch, even the Pre-order bonus teams arent available on release.The graphics options are extremely limited  with only preset settings such as Very low, low normal high and very high, enable grass and spectators and resolution. Thats it.Volume is the same with 3 options on 3 fixed sliders: FX Music Comments all going from 0 - 10.The Tutorial is once again sorely lacking for any new comers to the game with no showing of how the calculations are done.The campaign mode is a huge step backwards from the original, i prefered where i could pick my own team and lead them through a campaign rather than a single story mode.

												In it's current state, I see very few reasons you'd pick this over the Chaos Edition of BB1.The graphics are significantly nicer, but that's about it. Rules have been changed, bugs are still present, the single player is an absolute joke of a drawn out tutorial, but the killer is there's only 8 teams. I don't think it's so much a problem that you don't have access to more, rather that when playing online, you're only going to be seeing those 8 teams. It gets very stale, and without some of the more ""fun but garbage"" teams, games just play out the same time after time.			"

												I don't normally review games. When I do it is normally to warn about some issues with early access content. I am writing this one solely because I feel the overall reviews for the game are too skewed in the negative direction. It's a little expensive for what it is if you aren't a huge fan, but on sale it's very much worth it. The game is not easy. Some rolls and some games will be hell. That's part of the fun. You're  best player will someday get killed by rolling a 1 twice in a row, having his armor broken, and rolling dead dead. If you want an easy game this game is not for you. However, the complexity of the strategy and the randomness of the rng are a mix that I personally love. There are a few UIC quirks, like only being able to do borderless fullscreen or bad controller support, but most of these are rather minor issues. The games not perfect, but too many people criticize things that don't matter because they don't like the gameplay or are just bad and don't learn how to play the game. I would give the game like an 8 at least. It's a game that should be enjoyable for most, but for some it will be one of the best games you've ever played and will hold a special place in your gaming heart. Giving a game a bad review for bad controller support when it isn't meant to be played with a controller is just childish			"

												----30 hrs----I bought this game first day of winter sale, it's been on my wishlist for a while : Campaign is about 15 hours long, and worth the $11 for the game alone.After the campaign you can join solo player leagues vs computer or multiplayer leagues vs players... depending how addicted you get leveling up and learning the game will depend how many hours you go from there. I'm addicted for sure :-)---75 hrs---Don't concede in player vs player matches.. play vs computer til you get confident in how the game works (25-30 hr play time)If you hate RNG then do not play this game.. you will win games based on luck and lose games based on luck once you learn how to play. Skill factors in this game, but no where near the luck factor. Not very often will you get balanced games where it comes down to who the better tactian is, but when you do it's awesome.Each game vs another person takes at least a hour and 15 mins to complete on 3 min turns (slightly less than a hour with 2 min turns)			"

												Most reviewers do not seem to understand what they have bought, so let me give it a try.BB2 is a board-game adaptation of the popular GW tabletop/board game of the same name.While the older Chaos edition has a lot more variety in terms of available teams, BB2 improves on the frankly horrible UI, Sound and Animation quality. While one can argue that the older designs are more charming and characterful, the new models are look pretty good, especially for a board game adaptation.The gameplay remains faithful to the board game, while tweaking the rules and resolving some balancing issues inherent to the game. It's debatable whether the developers have succeeded, however it has generally gotten better since the release.The Multiplayer has become more accessible, but as always it is basically unavoidable to get involved with the community and to organize your own league to play online in any serious way. The organization of said leagues and the games has been greatly improved.Real time mode was removed, it was after all a silly addition in the first place.Player customization has unfortunately been somewhat reduced.The teams are pretty balanced, much more than they are in the board game, but imbalance is not a bug its a feature. Beating a strong team (like the Lizardmen) with a comparatively weaker (or less blunt) team is one of the great sources of rewarding gameplay.Both ballplaying teams and bashing teams can win. Ballplayers are at an advantage however and bashers must play with some brain if they want to have a chance. This is not a game of brute mouse skill or reflexes, but rather of strategy and planning. You should not expect that just because you play chaos or orks that you can play like a drunk potato on Ritalin. Surprisingly the fast and fragile teams are a lot easier, which is balanced by their inability to dominate and submit the enemy.For new players the campaign, frustrating hours of crushing defeats or heavy reading online are the three unavoidable options. The game is arguably much more complex and punishing then the genera average and even knowing that the learning curve is unexpectedly steep.So after saying all that what is the fazit?A resounding recommendation.Even though frustrating at times, the fun to be had exceeds most multiplayer experiences I have had in years. The authentic and refreshing hard to learn, harder to master approach drew me in just like the first official videogame adaptation did. If you have a heart for this kind of game, check out the Crendorian Invitational videos on YouTube. Wait for a sale and buy the game. Unfortunately you have probably lost the opportunity to get 4 of the new teams for free, but still, 15 to 25 bucks for the base game is a pretty good deal.			"

												I've waited a bit to submit an evaluation. I will try being objective.Most of the complains about BB2 came from players that were playing BB chaos edition.You'll hear, that the game is not finished, not enough teams etc etc.Well, true there are only 10 teams released as for now. But they kind of forget that most bought 3 games and a few years to get to BBCE while the first BB was in fact realeased only with 10 races too. And no, you just cannot do a copy pasta from an old game to a new one with new engine and animations. So saying that all was already done for them is just nonsense.BB2 is a remake if you want call it. The graphics are very good, the color choice is well placed. When you look at it, you just wanna play.And you can play! Never had any crash of any sorts, updates, not that frequent, are fixing skills issues. Looks also like the devs are listening to community needs (just read next patch) but are the worst rubbish team at communicating.True there is a ingame real money market (actually you get free coins to spend on that market) but its only eye candy stuff like jerseys. ""Apparently"" they made a mistake by taking some ""free"" jerseys away from players to sell them, and we should get them back.DLC wise, you will need to buy with real money new teams. True, this could come up as a lot of cash if you want them all. One could argue that you only buy the ones you really need!So do i recommend the game?Of course! The game is good and very playable! The game itself is a bloody good game!there are still issues to be fixed true, but nothing gamebreaking.If you really want all the teams just buy BBCE, but dont mind old horrid graphics, and in all fairness ""not so better"" interface.

Note that most reviews do not have a whole lot of time invested in the game.Initially when my friend talked me into playing this I was hesitant to try it, but boy was I happy I did try. The game revolves around the RNG table top version of Blood Bowl and gives a sub story to the all famous Warhammer games. The goal is scoring a touch down, when you are defending you want to stop your opponent from doing that. By any means necessary. This is great and it can get pretty bloody. Some players will try to avoid you, while others try to maim your teammates. Team choice pretty much decides play style. though there are quite a few teams where you have the option of doing both.About the community, this game really shines when playing others. I've seen a lot of negative reviews about bad AI or long wait times in multiplayer. You can solve this by making a league with friends like I did. So far it has been a great experience, we have players with 1500 hour of experience and players like me with 20 hours (when I started). People have been really polite and helpfull to me and I've enjoyed both winning and losing.If you still have trouble finding a proper league be sure to contact me, I'm co-host of the Inner Circle Blood Bowl League and I'd be happy to welcome you.

												I am a HUGE Blood Bowl player, starting with the tabletop game in the '90s.  I played the original PC edition years ago and really enjoyed it.  As far as I can tell, this is a fun, faithful recreation of the Blood Bowl I enjoy.  BUT.  I bought this so I can play against the AI.  That's all I really want to do-- I don't want to use this to play other people online, because I don't want to be tied down for 2-3 hours at a time to finish a game.  And what do I find out?  Against the AI, there is NO SAVE GAME feature.  Meaning, even though I'm playing a solo game on my own terms, I can not stop a game and restart it at my own convenience.  I think this is a huge oversight.  I hate to do it, because it does seem like a good, fun game, but I can not recommend this for other people like me.			"

												This is a no purely because I like playing against the computer.  If you like to play PVP instead of playing against the AI the game would get a thumbs up.  If however the idea of a long campaign and single player storylines is what you are after, this is not the game to get.  I purchased this game (after owning Blood Bowl 1) because I read in a review that the AI had been improved.  Sadly that is not the case.   I played the entire campaign, over 15 games, and did not get scored on at all throughout the entire thing.  If you like playing against other people and miss the leagues that were in BB1, there are leagues going on here, and you can get some games in that way.			"

												I love blood bowl since the boardgame, but this version of it has so many bugs that it gets frustrating. I have had players get KO'd without being hit. The game forgetting to put my ogre on the pitch and worst of all not adding those precious star player points that my team have earned. This does have slightly better graphics and the UI easily better than the first version but the bugs have made me quit in frutstration and concede games on multiple occasions. The AI also has issues by making non-sensical moves, for example, when the opposite team has chance to score but doesnt, even on the last turn of the half. Additionally the menu UI (not the game) has taken a major step backwards from the previous game. As a huge fan I am sad to say give this a miss until either the bugs are fixed or it comes down by at least 33%.  Or play the previous version.			"

												Better graphics and animation, and its nice to see the announcers now.  Other than that?  An entirely inferior game to the original.  There are still bugs, there are vastly less teams, there seems to be less in-match announcer dialogue, there're no team-specific cheerleaders, the slow-mo tackle animations don't need to be for ""every"" tackle, tournements just ""end"" without any sort of victory scene or trophy.If/when the game gets a few major content updates, it may be worth it.  Til then, stick with the original.			"

												This is me making a new review of Blood Bowl II, Previously i gave this game a negative but to me i am now enjoying the game here is the Pro's and Cons of this game and my Personal opinions! feel free to discuss below as i love to communicatePro's1 - UI Is a Superb upgrade from BB1 its not clunky as it used to be.2 - The new Race aka Brettonians are a joy to play and use as there are multiple ways to play them! ( cKnoor has a good tutorial on how to build Brettonians and has footage of him playing them i suggest you check him out! )3 - The graphics here are amazing its superbly executed and it makes the gameplay a tad bit immersive for me personaly4 - Inviting your friends for a fun game of blood bowl is now a thing you can do, this is huge for a game like this!5 - The Announcers are back with more witty banter! I love Jim & Bob so so much <3 6 -  AI is alot smarter than BB1 but still make silly mistakes like ridiculous re-rolls7 - The Armour Customization Patterns are pretty nifty i like them alot i just wish you could have the option to create your own uniforms in a creator and choose from the multiple patterns , colors etc, But as it is im happy with it!8-  It's Bloody Bloodbowl!!!!!!!!!!!!The Bad1- The Campaign acts like a tutorial but that shoudlnt be the case, its a bit of a slap in the face to those who are wanting to play offline campaign which was actually very enjoyable for me in BB1 but it is possible to make a solo league online.2 - The Graphical options are not acceptable to be frank , its lacking in many customization.3 - There are a ton of races missing so there is not alot of variety to pick from and to much about with, this is probably going to be dlc im just hoping we dont get screwed with dlc teams for like 5$ a pop4 - When Customizing your Characters you have a minimal amount of faces to choose from so your team just ends up looking like an army of clones.These are my points feel free to share your opinions As of now i rate Blood Bowl II at a 7.5/10 Its a SUPER Fun game but with the minimal races i cannot rate it over 8, if there were more races this game would easily be a 8/10 but theres still things need fixing!

												Lots of mixed reviews for this game.I played the original table top game back in the 90's (2 different versions of it). I'd say it's pretty damn faithful to it in the fact that now matter how well you plan you're going to end up rolling a 1, another 1, a 10 and a 12 and your favourite player is going to die horribly.The dice rolls aren't off, dice are dice and nuffle hates you.Sure there's a lot of races missing and there's a lot that could be done regarding customization but that's all fluff that players of the older pc version are used to.I actually got the first version after getting this one and found it clunky and horrible regardless of the extra features.At the time of this review I've got about 290 hours in the game, only played 3 races + the campaign/tutorial and not played MP yet. I've more than had my money's worth even with buying all the dlc.People don't understand that creating a new team requires all new models (for the most part), animations, programming and sound and not something the team working on the game can knock up in an afternoon and give away for free. I'm not a fan of paid for dlc but in this case it does have value and is worth the price. Just because you've been used to playing with 27 (guess) teams on the previous game, table top or fumbblr you have to realise that in a new engine it's not cheap.All that aside it's not without it's issues. The AI is a bit clunky at times. I've never been fouled by the AI and they've never used the quick snap event. The UI is better after the last update but still a bit icky at times. A few rules are a bit silly (bank stuff and stadiums).All in all though it's a good faithful adaption of blood bowl albeit with a few changes. If pressed I'd give it 8/10 and hope more people discover it, buy the dlcs and we end up with more teams :)			"

YouTubeâ¢ Video: Blood Bowl 2 - ReviewÂ 

			Views: 9,339		

			Idiotech presents an in-depth review of Blood Bowl 2. Blood Bowl is a complex turn based strategy game set in the Warhammer universe and developed by Games Workshop.		

For a more in-depth review watch the video above. This was my first time playing blood bowl and I have to say I fell in love with the games mechanics. That being said the game does have problems and I am concerned about the yet to be priced DLC races. The game does not present information well and if you are new to the franchise expect to be reading guides and watching Youtube videos as the in game tutorial is awful. It's a must buy for strategy fans, for everyone else it might be worth waiting for a sale.			"

												CAREFUL : This is not a Sport or an Action Game, This is a pure Turn-based Strategy Game. It needs a lot of planning and thinking at every minute. And the RNG must be part of the strategy, which means you must try to throw the dice as little and as late as possible each turn.You can expect long and slow matches, but they are GREAT if you like this type of game and the Blood Bowl Universe.

												Fun tactical game with team customization and online play, especially good if youre planning on picking up the boardgame since the rules are same.PROS:+Great gameplay+Large replay-value+Multiple factions (More with dlc)+Online capability+Challenging AI+Customization+Graphics+Easy to learn basics from the campaignCONS:-Graphics/visuals (clipping issues, somewhat repetitive or poor animation time to time)-Campaign is one race only-Campaign is pretty much just a glorified tutorial-Couple of the dlc teams should be in the vanilla game-Dissapointed that the players appearance doesnt change when they level up (minor issue)-Mechanics can seem unforgiving or weird for players new to the genre or have never played tabletop miniture games.Some of the things are both pros and cons in their way, but generally i'd recommend this game. It's really addciting and great, i only bought it recently so these notions can change. "

												This game is probably fine if you are mostly interested in playing multiplayer. However unfortunately this game revealed how much AI's struggle with situations like Blood Bowl. I played through the entire campaign and conceeded one touchdown in the entire series. Now some of this was due to the fact that the campaign gave you a TR far in excess of your opponents without give them inducements but most of it was due to the fact that the AI constitantly made stupid plays. From running their throwers away from the ball and picking it up with someone else, random one square moves and just having no understanding of how many turns were left in the half. The storyline was fun and the random events were interesting but in the end if I could get my money and time back I would.			"

												Bloodbowl itself is weird to recommend. It's something you have to try to see if you like it, but ask yourself these three questions firstDo you like strategy games? If no, don't get this, this is more strategy than sport.Are you not okay with permadeath, Don't get it, your players who are amazing will eventually die. (X-com level of trauma).Are you not okay with losing due to bad luck? Don't get it, because chance will screw you.This leaves the question, should you get Bloodbowl 1 or Bloodbowl 2Bloodbowl 2 is like two steps forward and one step backwards. Graphics are obviously better than the first one. The UI has improved in some aspects, percentages are shown instead of forcing the player to know the rules. However grids on the field are missing, as well as the quick overview of the roles of the players. This is quite annoying since some different players can look the same. Tutorial is also way better than BB1, it's slow but it explains the game fairly well.The other single player content is lacking though, so you will mainly be playing this multiplayer. I recommend joining a private league though, as the normal matchmaking is flawed, due to some teams being clearly better in that format. These are easy to find in the steam forums. The community is way bigger, so you will find matches much faster, about 30 seconds, instead of the 15 minutes in BB1.Difference in the amount of teams is quite big though. 10 in BB2 while there are 24 in BB1. That said the ten teams in BB2 are all of relatively equal strength, with one maybe being weaker than the rest. Whereas at least 6 six teams in BB1 are deliberately weaker. The advantage of ten players however is that it is easier for new players to learn strategies against the different teams. So, I would say that for a new player bloodbowl 2 is better, but I would still wait for a sale.			"

												Another attempt. I'm not sure why those involved in converting GW titles believe they need to recreate a new experience, when folks already enjoy an existing one. Unless you believe digital gamers today are that different from their traditional gamer counterparts? No. Guy and gals - the game's been designed and tested. All we want from you is some lovely visualisation (which this title does give) and for you to use our computers to aid our play. Team managment. Customizing models/painting. Organise leagues. Customise leagues. Learn to make the computer support and expand on the existing play experience. Make it work for us.A virtual table-top for GW fun.Instead we get poorly implemented league management tool. Feeble customisation options. No tools to aid play, such as a grid. And a terrible camera. That cannot be rotated. Because...?Oh and some rule/skill changes. Let's fiddle with the player costs (Orc Blizter) and the human catchers's AV (Now 8). Because the years of itterative testing and feeback are obviously not as valued as the opinions of Cyanide's so-called game designers. Good call guys/gals.Those lovely graphics? While certainly pretty, they suffer from form over function. If you were a fan of Chaos Edition's visual graphic changes as each player levelled (for example, Chaos Warriors would get more impressive armour) then tough luck. The models don't reflect the player's level - where once you could simply look at an opponents player and get an idea of its level/power, now a rookie looks the same as legend. And racial cheerleaders? Ha! Humans for everyone! Yes, no more race-specific cheerleaders. Finally, you can't choose to NOT use a skill - and some skills simply work differently to the actual game rules, that this mockery is meant to be representing. I'd like to believe it was another attempt at Cyanide trying to 'improve' the game, but its mostly probably just poor implementation. I swear to the RNGods - whenever/whoever makes a Necromunda game, if they follow the logic of Cyanide and those chumps that did Mordheim, we'll have a narrative-driven multiplayer FPS shooter....Edit: Update the info on the grid, which was added after launch. Added additional details on changes to orc/human, inabilty to rotate camera and no option to not use a skill.Edit 2: Orc prices changes have been reverted. It seems they realised that their in-house data may not have matched over a decade of real-world play testing and development. Camera still locked.			"

												Overall, unless you want to play online, I recommend folks grab the Chaos edition instead - it's got the complete teams, and other than that, the game is almost identical.

Posted: August 22, 2016
												This game is actually a pretty faithful re-creation of the classic Games Workshop Board Game, which was kind of an American Football-lite for Fantasy Nerds.  Blood Bowl always seemed to me like what the Wargamers at GW went and worked on when they got sick of writing all the ""In the grim darkness of yadda yadda there is only war"" stuff that is the rest of their product line and just wanted to make their admittedly-brilliantly modeled dudes hit one another for 20-30 minutes.This is a turn-based, piece pushing, dice-rolling game played on a grid.  The object of the game is, of course, to score the most points by putting the ball into the opposing team's end zone, and that is where the rules stop being American Football, since there is no down system.  Instead, we have wargames miniature mechanics instead, which is cool, if you're into it.  The campaign is servicable, and teaches you to play while throwing a couple of fun curves your way, but League Play is where it's at!  Watching your pieces level up only to be unexpectedly permakilled by an enemy piece is actually a heck of a lot of fun, and combines all the best of a sports management game, with a fun little tactical wargame thrown in.RIP Gnaklet for example, Goblin rookie sensation for the Skacrag Rudeboyz - an agile, touchdown-scoring machine, Gnaklet managed to reach Level 5, was an unparalled reciever with a 7 Agility, until he met his end during the final moments of a disasterous match against human team The Marauders, when one of their Blitzers, Detluf Fleif, rushed him to clear the field for Catcher Manfred Angurney to score their second touchdown of the game, trouncing my poor Rudeboyz 2-0. That being said, the AI is kinda stupid at times, and the RNG can feel frustrating when the dice are against you, but I'd definitely say this is one of the more successful Games Workshop IP translations out there, and if you're at all into Blood Bowl the boardgame, or the premise sounds interesting to you, I say, check it out, Join a league, and have a laugh.

I was HAPPY to pay for the DLC races as I actually felt there was some value.  Had I known there would also be microtransactions for simple player shirts  and other features REMOVED from previous games, I would NEVER have bought it.

WAY less teams.-It also has a terrible UI (even worse than BB1).-Much less stats.-No player names.-NO PLAYER NAMES !?-The camera is dreadful. You cannot plan your next move while your opponent plays as the camera keeps moving.-No scrollable log of the dice rolls. BB1 had a horrible little text log but it was scrollable at least.-League creation is a joke. BB1 had far more options when it came to creating leagues/cups.Shocking stuff.Super 'game' wrapped up in a stinking mess of a product.			"

Graphics are much more polished this go-around, the AI is a bit smarter and for the most part the rules are kept intact.  BloodBowl isn't for everyone, there are a ton of RNG nail-biting moments due to it's boardgame roots, so others may not like that.  As for me, smashing down the field with a bunch of crazy greenskins will always be enjoyable :)			"

At first I thought the whole football premise was weird but this game is actually incredibly fun. It's really easy to find people to play, the game looks great and runs well. If you are a BloodBowl fan, or a fan or turn based tactical games like XCOM then I would definitely give this a try.			"

												Bretonnians and graphics are the only real advantages to this game over Bloodbowl Chaos Edition. You can't save and exit from a single player game, and get penalised for quitting against AI. I don't understand the people who think the UI is better: inviting people to leagues is decidely more fiddly and sometimes it is infuriating that you click on your team wanting to play with them, only to remember that you have to exit out of two menus, and then go back into a completely separate menu just to play with them. The control system is worse than the original, though you can switch it back to the other system. The cutscenes get boring and samey. There are less teams, and ironically less graphical customisation options.			"

												Being a fan of the board game, I got a discount on steam for this game and some in-game cosmetics when i got my very own box of blood bowl from GW. I figured i'd give it a shot, and i'm satisfied as all hell. Besides offering the more intuitive and fast-paced gameplay experience that modern computing offers, it feels much like a living, breathing version of the board game. With it being so much cheaper, faster, and easier to grasp than the board game, I do reccomend this to new players of blood bowl. For old players, you will want to try it out as well. However, when the nerddomsets in you should get yourself a box of the newly released board game and kick someâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥in the physical world as well.			"

												Once you get your head around tackle/ assist zones, you'll find Blood Bowl is an extremely strategic and tactical game. It's basically super-violent chess. If you take the time to learn all of the mechanics and little nuances, you'll be rewarded with a great gaming experience. This sophisticated rule-set is counterbalanced beautifully by the incessantly crunching violence of the game's stylisation, which makes it this complex gaming oxymoron, simultaneously intellectual and mindless.In keeping with the prevailing ethos of early Games Workshop, the game is brutal and unforgiving: your favourite palyers will die and you will be subjected to the unpitying randomness of the dice. Suck it up. Savour it. In terms of the philosophy of games, I find that this kind of game mirrors life most accurately; when you expect your Kroxigor to tackle the living daylights out of an elf, he'll roll double skulls and die. Great, I say. Who wants some patronising game that leads to you to believe in the fallacy of a 'sure thing'? I know I don't.Anyhoo, 10/10 would be tossed mercilessly hither and thither by the winds of fate again.			"

												The game is a lot like Chess. You move your pieces around and try to out think, out maneuver and trap your oppnent in order to win. But imagine you are playing Chess and you move your Queen to capture an insolated Pawn -- but what happens instead is that Pawn kills your Queen.That's Blood Bowl 2.			"

												There's nothing better than a game that gives you RNG that really slaps you in the face. When it's choosing which crappy die result after attempting a tackle, or screaming at your dumbass Troll who refuses to move a single space (or ate your  Goblin for that matter). After every failed roll, loss, injured player, or failure to pick up a ball that is right in front of them; my verdict on this game still remains positive and I will break it down why.Gameplay: Blood Bowl is a turn based dice rolling game of football where every player on your team makes a difference in terms of positioning and stats. My favorite part about this is that you can create your own team and have them compete in tournaments and leagues. Death is permanent for your players however so be prepared for when high level Mr. Badass gets murdered by a little innocent Skink. As you progress, you can upgrade your stadium and team staff with more cheerleaders and coach assistants so you can make the best team of all the Elves, Orcs, Rats, or Humies.Atmosphere: given that this is a Warhammer fantasy game, you see a lot of familiar races such as the Skaven, Black Orcs and Chaos but set in a stadium for some good wholesome sport where anything goes to achieve victory. The two announcers are quite the treat themselves with their commentary on about anything that goes on in the game.Graphics: very well designed and detailed with every separate character in the game. not much to say but nothing to really complain about.Overall, Blood Bowl 2 makes for a great game for you to get angry at because RNG dictates that you  cannot make the perfect play. So get your team together, warm up those blocking dice and pray to Nuffle that you will succeed.			"

												I will list the positives first then move on to the negatives. The graphics are great, the animations excellent. Unlike in Blood Bowl: Chaos edition, the animations actually add to the drama rather than distract from it due to their clunkiness in CE. Even in the 8 race basic edition, there is quite a bit of variation in the races, so players of different styles can experience very different play styles.Private leagues and competitive leagues enforce rules that make it less likely, that people concede games mid-game, so there is a lot of possibilities to play proper matches in good humour. The developers are also continuing the development of these features, and are also adding new teams as DLC.However, there are quite a few problems as well. First of all, in the official casual ladder people concede constantly, since there are no negative rewards for doing so (I myself recently conceded a match after I lost half my team to injuries in the first half. In my defence, it was the first match with that team and there was no way I was going to keep it. But still, it was a douchey move, my opponent certainly wanted to finish the match.).There have been several bugs, like the infamous reimbursement of money used in the inducements stage before a match.There are only 8 teams in the basic game, and the dlc are about 7e a piece, which, if you get them all, adds up to a quite an expensive package. The dlc are also coming by at a rather slow pace, since the game is already a year old, and there have been only 5 new teams so far. This adds up to only about half of what CE had.The most serious problem with the game is, that there are no ""fun"" teams available at the moment. The teams are all more or less competitive, and there are no teams that are designed to be fun and not serious. For example goblins, halflings and vampires aren't great, but when one gets bored of being hacked to death by chaos, dwarves or the undead (necrotic or not), it would be fun to unwind and lose with a team that is not even supposed to win all the matches. All in all, it is a mixed bag and I recommend it to anyone who finds the setting interesting, but you need to be prepared to study the game and watch some tutorials on youtube. It is great fun when you get into it though, just very frustrating kind of fun!			"

												It's blood bowl so it's pretty great off that. To those who don't know it's like Xcom and NFL blitz came together. It's wicked fun. The game has a very sharp learning curve and the in game tutorial does a terrible job teaching it. Because the game is so niche expect to get destroyed when you go online. Sites like bbtactics will help a lot in getting you up to speed.One complaint I do have about it is that the DLC is very expensive. I'm hoping during the next steam sale we start seeing it drop in price more. Also it doesn't really effect the game play any, but since this is an extremely fluff heavy game I really wish there was more options to customize your stadium and cheerleaders. I want to see a bunch of orcs and skaven with pom poms.			"

												The control system is better than previous but the campaign is basically a tutorial and dlc is unables to be used on it which is rubbish, hopefully they remove the online only aspects allowing full control of teams for main game23/12/2015 updatePlayed again after recent update, they have added an offline mode that is similar to the short games in BB1 but it is still missing the offline campaign element where you can use your dlc team if you want in it, so this game still is governed by the online side which will only last as long as there is server support which sucks, tbh there is better development and play on the Mobile game on android or apple you just have to suffer the touch screen side of things or the xbox arcarde version which is very good for playability and offline content			"

I Know Nothing... ...  about American football.OK, So I know that the word football in the name is misleading because itâs mostly played with the hands (I had a little rant about this in my review for Rocket League if you really want to read more of my ramblings on the subject...) but beyond that Iâm lost, I have no clue about the rules of the game, the tactics employed or anything else useful.As an ignorant Brit peering in from the outside it looks similar to Rugby but with body armour.My knowledge ends there.I Know Almost Nothing... ... about the Warhammer universe.OK, So I Know that it has got something to do with Games Workshop which leads me to suspect it involves tabletop games with complex rule sets, multifaceted dice and a liberal sprinkling of Orcs.Iâve seen several Warhammer based video games come out over the years, none of which I ever got around to playing (I know... I know... shame on me!) and Iâm also pretty confident that whilst a âBlood Bowlâ sounds like an implement you might find in a hospital it is in fact a game set in the Warhammer Universe.Beyond that Iâm as ignorant to the intricacies of Warhammer as I am to those of American FootballUniquely QualifiedArmed with this devastating lack of knowledge I have recently dived head first into the football/Warhammer mash-up that is Blood Bowl 2, sequel to the 2009 title Blood Bowl which you wonât be surprised to learn passed me by completely.Educational BeatingHaving watched the funny and brutal intro scenes I found myself managing (and controlling) a down on its luck human (mostly) football team called the Reavers.Looking after this team serves as both a  tutorial and an introductory campaign to get you up to speed and ready to take your âBlood Bowlingâ prowess online.The tutorial campaign does a really good job of showing you the ropes, starting off with a simplified version of the rules and building up the complexity with each progressive match until you actually know what youâre doing.This subtle, layered approach is a perfect introduction for a blood bowl beginner like myself, I never felt overwhelmed by rules and each new concept was introduced in a way which made sense.The campaign also has a light but fairly interesting story to keep you engaged between matches and ties everything together nicely.Pad AwayWhilst Blood Bowl is a fantasy sports title donât go into this game expecting a FIFA or PES like experience or youâll be disappointed, this is a turn based tactical affair, think XCOM with a football and youâll be pretty damn close to the play style on offer here.Dicey DecisionsThe game take place across various stadia where you'll issue commands to each of your players individually and cross your fingers that everything goes to plan.There are several actions available depending on the player type, from moving to a new position on the field, passing the ball or nobbling an inconveniently placed opponent to take them out of the action.The success of these actions will depend on your player stats (as you would expect) and the randomness of a dice roll.This randomness can be hugely irritating at times, if lady luck isn't smiling then even the best thought out move with most appropriately skilled player is going to fail, stats be damned, the dice of fate always have the final say... (how I've come to hate those dice).Having said that, I can understand the need for this dice based uncertainty, even the best players fall flat on their face sometimes, it's still annoying though and maybe a little too random for my tastes.GOAL!The aim of all this games-workshopy, dice-rolly action is to get one of your little guys  to stay upright long enough with the ball (which isn't round) to run clutching it between their hands  <cough> not football  <cough> and score something called a ""touchdown"".  (which apparently isn't anything to do with planes and runways).Compulsory FrustrationAfter you've struggled your way through the tutorial campaign you'll know enough to be able to create your own team, and take your overconfident self online for a lesson in humility.But before I get into the humbling experience of on-line play, let me explain why I both love and hate that introductory campaign.As I mentioned a few paragraphs back, the tutorial does an excellent job of introducing the game rules and mechanics at a steady pace, unfortunately, what it doesn't do so well is let you progress through it by winning matches, that alone is not enough!It also insists that you complete some very challenging objectives along the way such as ""Score a touchdown with player type X"" or ""foul player X a certain number of times""The campaigns insistence on completion of these ""bonus"" objectives can result in you having to replay a match several times before you're allowed to move forward.I can't overstate how annoying this is, but you could just skip the campaign and dive straight into team creation and online play if you know what you're doing. (which unfortunately I didn't).Creative ChaosYou create and manage your own Blood Bowl team from a selection of different races, from squishy humans through to squat dwarves.The eight disparate races on offer with the base game come with their own strengths and weaknesses , an Orc isn't likely to have the agility required to pull off a graceful run around the opposing teams defence just as a slender Elf is less likely to muscle its way to the end zone by flattening a wall of defending  Orcs.The different play styles required by differing races go a long way to keeping the game play fresh, although many might be by disappointed that only 8 playable races are included with the base game, but hey, that's what DLC is for, right?Depending on which race you've selected you'll have several different player types available to choose from ranging from throwers and catchers (bet you can guess what they specialise in) to blitzers (for blitzing...) and linesmen (for... err... making up the numbers).Anyway, after you've agonized about putting together a well balanced squad and more importantly given them all amusing names, it's time to actually put your team to the test.Play Ball!There are several ways to do this, you can play a friendly match, join a league or even create your own.  You're not forced to go online until you're ready either, the AI will happily try to pummel you into the ground as readily as any online player would.As I said earlier, the matches themselves play out in a very turn based, action-pointy kind of way, but there's more going on here than just the matches, there's a football management side to Blood Bowl too.You'll be buying and selling players, doing up your stadium, investing in bonuses (some of which can make a huge difference to the outcome of a match, re-roll is especially useful as it gives your dice a second chance to win lady lucks favour.)There's plenty going on here  and you'll find yourself becoming attached to certain players as you progress through several matches with them, don't get too attached though.They Killed Kenny!Like X-com, you're going to end up with ""favourites"" on your squad, there'll inevitably be a thrower that always seems to hit his mark, or a catcher with safe hands that always comes through for you, but be warned, your players are not invincible.They can get knocked down, knocked out, maimed and even killed during the course of a match.Losing a star player can...

												Now with a ""Year After"" review added.What BB2 still currently lacks...is the Ability to allow Sportsmanship.  Continuing to Lack the Tools for Players and Especially League Admins to fix ""issues and glitches"" in order to keep things fair and right is a problem.  The game STILL isn't worthy of the people who play it.Granted it looks and sounds nice, but there are so many things wrong with this release.Price Point.  Far too high, especially in light of just how much content is missing.DLC teams.  Again Price Point much too high, Seven Ducats for EACH team is practically criminal, the first Blood Bowl is far better value for the money.Lack of Starting Teams.  Seriously?  Where's even the basic Undead team?  No Amazons?  No Norse?  The list goes on and on for just how many teams that came with the starting Board Game of Lore.  Goblins?  Nope.  Halfings?  Nope.  And it goes further and further.  Elf variant teams?  One is DLC and the rest are missing.  Chaos Dwarves?  Not here.  Necro or Khemri?  Triple Skull.Bugs and Stupid AI.  Well the AI is still no shakes of a stick at like in the prior game, and some of the bugs are really bad.  They have promised patches  but these appear to be slow to follow.Seriously, if just really need to get this one, wait for a sale at least.  It is NOT worth the full price at all.July 2016 - Is it any better after a year?It's STILL not a recommended game at full price point.  Gradually we have more teams coming out...Norse finally, and Undead e-v-e-n-t-u-a-l-l-y.  But at this rate we're looking at YEARS if ever to have a full complement of teams.  No Amazons on the Horizon...Goblins or Halflings?  Nope...Chaos Dwarves?  Not a peep, etc.  There's ""whispers"" of Nurgle but suspect we're looking at 2017 at this pace.  I've seen Mummies shuffle down the field faster...Glitches...oh yeah.  They continue to be an issue.  Play the campaign?  Better not score with a player with Kick when it gives that mission to unlock (spoilers) Griff.  Griff with Kick is enough to make Jim renounce his Red Wine...Badly coded Overtime?  Still there, and saw that even in the World Cup recently.  Team wins a flip yet ""gets his drive picked FOR him"" if he wants to be offence or defence.  Seriously?  Cost a World Cup game to the unfortunate coach, and yet STILL no Admin ability to ""correct and wind back the clock"".  If you're going to be serious about wanting this to be a ""major multi-player supported game with leagues and tournaments"" you NEED those tools in place.  The ""concept"" of the game is STILL brilliant to this day.  And the opponents and wonderful casters out there Sage, Fantastic, VG and all the rest keep me coming back and just enjoying myself.  Someday...this game might be worthy of the quality of people who play it.  I dare to dream...			"

												I am not a person that usually writes reviews but seeing how many negative ones there are I figured I should try to help balance things out. For those who know nothing about it. The game is a very unforgiving and clever turn-based strategy game set in an alternate version of the Warhammer Fantasy setting. It parodies american football and follows a similar set of rules but is (arguably, hah) more violent.Most negative reviews made by the self-appointed veterans of the series have rated the game poorly mainly for the reason that it has fewer races than the original Blood Bowl did. They write this however not mentioning that the previous iteration had in fact FEWER races on it's release. Sure, Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition has a noticably larger collection of them now but this was the game in it's final form. It was released THREE YEARS after the regular Blood Bowl had come out and was dubiously priced at the time.These reviewers in their frustration add that the only way that the game improves on it's predecessor is in the graphics department which is in fact not true in any way whatsoever. A common complaint is that the new campaign is worse I but in all honesty the original one wasn't good either. The game was always best when playing against other people and Blood Bowl 2 features a significantly better matchmaking system in it's multiplayer. The game's UI and controls are not nearly as clunky and unfriendly to new players (or all players for that matter) as the original was yet at the same time it does not feel dumbed down making the game much less frustrating than the first part.Finally I'd like to add that the costs involved in making a single race (it's animations, models etc.) are astronomical and it should not come as a surprise to anyone that the game has ""only"" ten races so far. I strongly recommend that if you are even slightly interested in the game you should buy it now, not wait ""for more to come"". The game is a blast as is, is regularly being updated and the developers do really need any money they could get in order to ensure more content in the future.			"

												I see a lot of negative reviews from people who have played the original blood bowl games which I can't comment on due to BB2 being my first experience of the game, all I can say is that I love it, if I've got free time it's my first, second and third choice, and if I'm not playing I'm watching a stream :)Pros: 1. Incredibly deep gameplay/strategy, after 600 hours I still feel like a noob, every team can be developed differently according to how you like to play, and more than half the teams haven't been released yet so still plenty of variety to come. 2. The game looks great and the UI is mostly excellent with some occasionally annoying exceptions which the developer has been regularly but slowly fixing.3. The community. This is the best thing by far, Bloodbowl isn't a game with a huge player base but it seems like once you start playing you don't stop, a huge amount of strategy guides available, all the streams I've seen have a very welcoming chat and once you feel like you've got a grasp of the basics there are a lot of private leagues with some really good and friendly players.Cons:1. Steep learning curve with a not great match making system can lead to some impossible games when you're just starting out, the tutorial will teach you the basics, but very slowly, I'd recommend watching some streamers and asking questions in chat over playing the tutorial, and when you search for a game stopping and starting the search every ten seconds or so will help to avoid the more ridiculously impossible match ups.2. Time. Games can take over an hour to play, there's no speed mode so if you don't have that kind of time then this isn't the game for you.3. Salt. Everything in this game is decided on the roll of a dice, there will absolutely be times when you know you're playing someone who isn't close to being as good as you but he'll wreck you because he'll get every dice roll his way. The better you are the better you will be able to allow for the variance but sometimes you're going to be left disgusted.4. No competitive rankings. There's nothing currently like the ladder in hearthstone to judge yourself by, the main match making league is perpetual so really you have to join private leagues to find proper competition. Cyanide have put up prizes for a world cup competition but reallistaically only the very best players have a chance of qualifying for that, definitely my biggest problem with the game currently.Edit: I now have over 1100 hours on this game and still addicted to it, to update the pro's there has now been a year of DLC teams being added, with two more imminent, all done to the same high standard as the base game teams, and all definitely beatable by the teams you start with, so don't feel like you need to pay to win here.With the cons, the match making has been improved somewhat, with everyone going into a pool with a max 5 minute waiting time, which generally has improved the fairness of the games. There is now also a Champion ladder where experienced players can challenge each other to get the best record with the race of their choice, the winners all going into play-offs to find the overall champion. This new mode has really improved the match making experience, allowing you to find a real challenge even if you don't have the time/interest in signing up for private leagues.			"

There aren't a lot of massive changes from the first game, and there are even options to change various things to get an experience more similar to it. The campaign is a nice touch, but getting involved with a community is probably the best way to play the game. Thankfully Blood Bowl communities are fairly inclusive and not hard to find.			"

												It's pretty, I'll give it that. And I imagine in a year or two it will be solid. But much like BB1 was at launch Bloodbowl 2 is far from a complete game. Putting aside the fact that they don't have goblins or halflings (which is sort of a dealbreaker for me right off the bat) the lack of fullscreen (You can play borderless window at full resolution, but that overtaxes some hardware) makes it almost unplayable and little things like no armor upgrades and lack of a true solo campaign (you can play in a solo league but it is noteably less awesome than the solo campaign in 1 where there was a map and more of a sense of a world and story) make the game just lacking in gameplay compared to Chaos Edition.So here's what it comes down to. If you're a hardcare blood bowl player and you want to support the studio so they can continue to imrpove this game and utlimately have 2 as full featured (or hopefully more) as one, then buy it. It definitely has promise and my family bought 3 copies for this reason.If you don't already have Chaos Edition it really comes down to what's most important to you. If it's graphics then by all means, get II!If it's gameplay... well I honestly can't bring myself to recommend II over Chaos Edition... yet. Chaos has had years to polish things and has 23 races compared to 8 here.  Which is really frustrating for me because I have friends I'd like to get into BloodBowl. But since I myself will be sticking with Chaos Edition until they've added some key things like fullscreen, more races, and a better single player experience, it's pretty hard for me to recommend this over Chaos, particularly given that Chaos is cheaper.

												Highly recommend Blood Bowl 1.  This sequel functionally adds some fun additions to the play and fixes some multiplayer annoyances.  The game content is fantastic. But there's no reason to spring for the newer version. Normally I'd support the switch to a more open platform with some purchasable mods in the interest of the developers making a few honest dollars from some colorful content (along with vastly the multiplayer community.) However... Unforgivable Sin: Must now Purchase Formerly Free Content (Wood Elves, and Lizardmen Races)Bad Things: 1. Much Increased Loading Times2. Increased AI Thinking Times (The 4 minute countdown timer doesn't apply to the AI.)(On my computer about 2 minutes for anything more complex than a kickoff or the first turn after.)(Totaling to double the time for me to finish a game, although admittedly, my computer isn't so great.)3. % of Success posted not modified by auto-reroll skills such as catch and dodge. (Essentially they're showing the odds of a single dice roll. Yay.)Good Things: 1. In-Game Save.2. Players have modifiable appearance.3. Interesting Campaign4. Modifiable Locations  (Including some really fun stuff.)5. Funnier commentary.6. % of success posted for risky moves.I don't resent them for trying to make money off a great game. But I bought the game for the content. Now there's additional charges for races I can play in the old version for free? Sorry. I'll play the old version. There's just not enough difference for me to care.			"

Also Google bloodbowl tactics and ""Tackle zones""Very satisfying when things goes as planed, but BBII is also the game I've been most frustrated with.Nuffle, The God of Dice, can be very sneakyOne more thing: Do the safe moves first, like raising your players after they're knoked down. Do not start with the uncertain moves, like picking up the ball and passing it (there are 3 rolls there, pick up ball 67%, pass: anything from 17%-83% depending on agility of the players involved and on the lengh of the pass. The catcher also have to roll to catch it)			"

												well, after now logging 450 hours on this game i can honestly say this. while i havent logged ANY hours against live opponets, all my time is against the AI. that being said i have found that as your team gets better the AI throws up aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥team which you GIVE a HUGE handicap to and then it proceedes to beat theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥outta your team that has taken quite the while to build up. the game is done by the same company that does MORHEIM and my edumacated guess is that it uses the same AI or a derivative there of. this version of blood bowl does in fact mirror the 'new' version of the miniature game very well. all in all it is a fun game and i would recommend it, tho be preparred for some let down especially against the AI.

												Part 1: REVIEW FOR PLAYERS FAMILIAR WITH BLOOD BOWLThis is just another BB client. Some pros, some cons in comparison with BB1.  The most noticable differences:1. Much better online than BB1 in public leagues. Private leagues will need some time to evolve to the level of BB1, but I believe it will happen soon enough.2. Interface is different and will require some time to adopt, but is of about the same level.3. Less number of teams, others will probably be in DLCs.4. AI is betterm but still good only for newcomers, it'll not hold vs experienced coaches.5. Some optional and obligatory homerules and some rules are bugged, but nothing gamebreaking if you can live with some changes from the rules.6. Better graphics.Part 2: REVIEW FOR NEW PLAYERSThere are several BB clients on the market: Fumbbl (the worst GUI and graphics, the best content), BloodBowl2 (the best GUI and graphics, most differences from original board game rules), BB1 is somewhere in between. There is no point in buying BB1 now as the number of players in online is bad. If you are not a diehard board gamem fan, the differences with the rules should not matter much for you, so get BB2.Most negative reviews are coming from experienced coaches who areâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥off with some differences with the board game rules and low number of teams. In fact it doesn't affect the core of the gameplay and present teams are enough to represent most aspects of BB and are balanced well. Teams that can come as DLC later are not going to be much better, the balance is quite good here, so if you are not going to try them all you'll not have to spend money on them. So do not be afraid of poor ratings or ranting in the forums. Haters gonna hate, but it doesn't really make the game worser for new players.I would recommend this game to you if you like turn-based risk-managment games or warhammer universe.			"

												Don't mind the mixed reviews. This game is hell in a handbasket fun.The only issue is that you need to actively find people/meet people to get in a league for multiplayer. It's got a bit of a learning curve, but it's plenty fun, especially for the more tactical of folks.And if you're a nerd like me, you get to tackle theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥out of the people vicariously that you couldn't before in high school.-Slazz			"

												Ok I finally got this game, even though I waited until it was on offer. After reading other peopleâs reviews and how some actually said it wasnât worth buying, I eventually got a chance to play a few games, oh yeah, I also bought all the DLCâs, well technically thatâs not true as the Undead DLC was thrown in for free because I bought the wood elf and lizard men, thanks, that was a pleasant and unexpected bonus. Where to start, Ok if you have never played this game on PC before, donât bother getting the older version, and just buy this one instead. Graphics wise this version is so much better, I donât think itâs been optimised in any way, but you should be able to get playable framerates and visuals on a medium rig PC.Gameplay wise, I never really noticed that much difference from the original game, and the camera angles have remained the same. This is a quick game to pick up for new players, but learning the game properly can take a while to master, even with the dumb AI and sometimes ridicules dice roles that you get, but thatâs the fun of it.Donât be expecting some easy game, this game is very challenging even with the AI set to easy, because this is based on a table top game, where you are at the mercy of the dice rolls, this has certainly been captured and the frustration of seeing your thrower either miss his catcher or the catcher missing the ball entirely can be really frustrating.The commentary in the game is both entertaining and repetitive, but you do have the option to switch it off, I think. If you like the Warhammer universe, then this is certainly one to add to your collection, itâs by no means the sequel that everyone was expecting, but who knows, with more DLSâs coming out, we may eventually get the game that all the fans were waiting for.If I were to rate this out of 10, I would give it a solid 7.5, with plenty of room for improvement.

												I am going to recommend this game... but there are issues which detract from the enjoyment.First off, the positives:-This brings back a lot of fond memories of the original table top game.-graphics are decent.-Dialouge from the commentators is funny and the intermitent segments of history that pop up before a game are interesting to read.-Teams are quite balanced and so you can choose your style without finding yourself dramatically outmatched by a different style of play.Negatives:-Playing AI and in a league, you are unable to save game during a match. There might be an argument that you could just go back to an earlier point if loosing.... but... if you 'quit' the match, you can restart without any penalty.-The next issue is also related to AI games and is infuriating: If for whatever reason, you loose internet connection, your progress is not updated and you have to start the game again... there is no forewarning that connection has been lost...  so you only find out you've wasted an hour+ at the end.-Turn based games are fun.... but games are really slow... In this instance it can take the AI up to minute to decide on it's first move... seriously? I expected a bit more fluidity and speed from an AI's computations.-One of the commentators ruins the feal of the game by bringing up dice rolls - usually commentating on rolling a one. This takes some of the spark out of the roleplay genre... in a real game would you say a fumble was a roll of one? This is a pedantic irritation... but irritating netherless.Yes, I would recommend, but be aware that you might end up tearing out some of your hair.			"

												Blood Bowl 2 despite people complaining about the campaign and lack of content compared to the Blood Bowl 1is a great game. Blood Bowl 1 had a lot added on after launch so I am sure they will add more content and continue to support this game, and in terms of the campaign I think its completely skipable. If you want a good offline experience just play a solo league, so I don't see why saying the campaign is bad is a thing people would give this game a negative review for. The learning curve is a bit steep and the time comitment is a bit much but if your willing to keep trying you'll get the game down and have a great time with it.			"

												After watching TotalBiscuts' Blood Bowl 1 tournament years ago I saw this game coming up and thought why not give it a shot. Since then I've never regretted my decision.At first the game seems very punishing. If you don't take the time to learn the order of operations (safe moves first, risky plays after) you'll feel like you're gettingâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥on by RNG, but once you get the hang of that the game opens up. After 150+ hours in game I still feel like I learn something knew every time I play.The community is also pretty great, from what I've seen so far. I stream the game and so many people have come into my chat and offered to give me tips and tricks. They've really helped me improve and get much more enjoyment out of the game.It does lack a lot of teams for the moment, but they seem like they're looking to add more in the future. So far they're already addedf Norse and Undead. Nurgle, and Necro are on the way too.There is also the occasional bug, crashing here and there, but nothing has ever affected me personally aside from hilarious camera angles.Over all it's a solid game. If you're at all interested in the turn based strategy (with some rng), warhammer, or football you may very well enjoy this game.			"

												Absolutely no balance in the online play.  Unless you have 12 friends that all want to start a team together good luck finding a league to start a fresh team.  The matchmaking system has no ranking filter and will put you up against seasoned teams in your first match, making it not only almost impossible to win, but also not the least bit enjoyable.			"

												If you're a fan of the original game then this is well worth picking up. Same great Blood Bowl but with better animations, graphics, sleeker interface, better online support, and more. Only downfall is base product has a small selection of teams which makes the DLC feel a little forced in order to expand your options. However the developers have been offering up the DLC for free to those who already owned the game before it released so hopefully that practice will continue if there is another set of DLC teams.Hope to see ya out on the pitch!

												+ Greatly improved graphics over previous editions+ More intuitive interface+ Stomping the enemy team's star quarterback into the a dead, bloody paste is still fun+ Interesting single-player campaign/training mode for those new to the strategy in the series+ Stayed mostly true to the ruleset- Only 8 teams out so far, with as-yet-unpriced future DLC purchases required to get more teams- A few issues with crashing, which wouldn't be a big deal but for the fact you can't save an in-progress game.- Reported multiplayer issues.  I haven't had a problem, but others have.- Fewer player customization options than previous editionsOverall, I'll give this game a reccomendation because as a standalone game it's fun and enjoyable, but It was released early and it shows.  In the end, it'll probably be a worthy successor to the other Blood Bowl games, provided they don't charge an arm and a leg for extra teams.If you're on the fence, I'd wait to buy this product until we get to see how much they're going to charge for new teams.  If the price is too high, wait for a sale or a bundle.   Definitely worth getting, but don't be taken for a sucker on DLC.			"

												Here are my taughts after playing trough 90% of the campaign and trying out a bit of multiplayer.1. If you are a player experienced with the tabletop go buy BB1 Chaos Edition instead of this unless you prefer the better looking graphics. BB1 CE is still way superior to BB2 if you want genuine gameplay.    If you are a player new to Blood Bowl it's an awesome game however I recommend you buy this game on sale since in my opinion it's just not enough bang for your buck.Pros - Beginner friendly, Better graphics, slightly better AICons - Expensive in comparison to the content that you get. Being beginner friendly comes at the cost of many functions from the original game not being available (see below). Gameplay isn't optimized for PC but rather for console.As a genunine fan of the tabletop and in general I very much enjoyed BB1 Chaos edition I must say that i am in general dissapointed with BB2. This game still feels like it is in beta 1 year after its release. There is no option but to have your skills forced upon you, there is no passing template from a potential possition etc. Perhaps one thing that realy bugs me out is how much the adaptation for the console verision shines trough in the PC release, it makes the playing experience feel alot wonkier than BB1 Chaos Edition. Despite BB1 having its fair problems with bugs I still prefer that verision so far. Positives in BB2 are definelty graphics and so far I havent encountered as many bugs as there were in BB1. I'd also like to say that it's probably a lot more beginner friendly than BB1. There AI in singleplayer is also somewhat better.Maybe I just had to high expectations from this game since ive loved the game for more than 15 years. However at its current state I simply cannot recommend the game unless you buy it on sale.			"

												BETA REVIEWTHE BASICSFirst thing First the KILL CAM IS TO DIE FOR. ( slow mo death time is awesome :D)Blood Bowl 2 is the mutant ofspring of american football and the fantassy warhammer world. The game is sertannly a great laugh but also is serious enough to justify long term dedicated game time.This game inspires me to rage and ROFL in equal mesures depending on who nuffle ( blood bowl's god) shines on that day.The game is ALOT more new user freindly than BB1 with a user freindly interface and you can even get an assistant coach (AI) to build your team for you till you start to understand how things work.Bob and Jim our beloved ogre and vampire commentators never fail to make me laugh, a great example here (

			That awkward moment when ..... Yea nuff said hightlight from : http://youtu.be/ISLL0myRq8w		

 )The gameplay has 2 layers.1.The first of witch is where you design and change your team to fit you need as you manage things like your teams money and how many chearleaders you want to have.2. The second layer is the actual pitch where the game takes a TBS role where you posistion your players and fight all over the ball with the ultamate aim of scoreing more touchdowns than your rival.PERFORMANCEHas been outstanding for me to say the least next to no loading time and good frame rates throughout. (and i have been recoding gameplay on top so performance is awesome for me to say the least.FOR PEOPLE NEW TO BLOOD BOWL ( Starting guide )Orks and humans are the 2 teams id recomend starting with there good allrounders.orks if you want to be more blocky (fighting / killing) and humans if you want better controll of the ball.After you have a few games under our belt you may want to try a more specilised team with a playstyle you seem to lean towards and or like.For example you try the Humans out but notice you like to bash in your rivals head ... well then try moveing on the the dwarfs or the orks if you dont want to give up the ball game alltogether :PAt first it may seem like you have nothing but bad luck with turnover after turnover and the game is treating you badly for some reason but a large part of the game is risk managment to reduce those turnover and a good coach knows how to manage those risks.a few good tips for this are1. Allways stand up your fallen players asap2. Prioritse low risk and high reward actions before the vice versaFOR BLOOD BOWL VETRANS / CHANGES FROM BB1Its the old game you loved with a few ballance changes such as the ork blitzer has increased in price. ( I would go into more detail but as its the beta i expect they will either revert back or change more after the release / in updates to come)The animations are really nice and far better than BB1 as well as the graphics.The variations and differnt ""jerrsy"" / armour types are nice comapred too BB1The lack of teams compared too BB1 can hurt but its not as though be seen alot of those teams played often. All the bases are coverd basic playstyle wise though with it only despratly needing a goblin team for the pure ROFL epic failness that they create and the shockingly epic 1 in 200 play where it all goes right :PYou now get your own teams stadium to change and personelise to fit your team.Cheerleaders are allways the basic humans and i am hopeing and praying that is just for the beta but if its not i am going to be one sad bunny as i loved the differnt chearleaders from BB1AIThe AI is a big step up from BB1 with teams acting acordinly with there playstyle but any seasond players will probally still find it underwellming and need to look to PVP for there thrills.I expect there will be 5-10 DLC teams comeing either as single teams or as larger expanions pack style DLC.Hope This helps you decide if you want to take the plunge and try this game out.Good luck and se you on the pitch :Dwant to see gameplay please hop over to my channel :)https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEWi55_w4pBFCy06QGTdOBw "

												Let me start by saying I LOVE Bloodbowl.  I really enjoyed the board game and later the first Cyanide release of the PC game.Unfortunatley they somehow managed to epically F@#k up BB2.  The good things I will say is that they made the graphics better and more polished, and thats pretty much the end of the 'Pro's'There are too many cons to list so I'll just name my main ones.1. Your players look the same FOREVER, they dont get better looking gear as they level up, so your noob lineman ends up looking like a pro level 6 lineman.  Those who play BB will understand how lazy and lame this missing feature is, it was in BB1.2. They just made up some random rules, so the BB game that has been tested for 20 years apparently was no good so they just made some tweaks withouit checking with the community.  BB rules are like scripture to BB players, dont mess with them.3. You have to do about 10x more clicking than in BB1 to do your moves4. Leagues need fixing5. They dont listen or respond to the community on their forums6.  There are so many issues yet they hardly ever patch the game, in its current state you wouuld expect a patch a week.I never write negative reviews (I think this is my first ever) but they reallyâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥me off.  I would have been over the moon with all the features of BB1 and just improved graphics (you would think that would be the minimum).  Instead you get half the features of BB1 with random new rules and no updates/patches in sight.  Stay away for a year or so until (hopefully) they complete the game.			"

												I already really like this game. Awesome, brutal animations, relatively beautiful graphics and easy, simplistic controls. Blood Bowl is essentially American Football mixed with the Warhammer Fantasy Battle universe where Orkz pummel Humans into the turf with wild abandon. Ever wanted to kill your opponent's entire team rather than score touchdowns? Well, Blood Bowl is your game. And as far as competitive Blood Bowl Multiplayer goes, this is the best Blood Bowl to date. Full on team customization from colors to races, mixed with Cabal TV (allows you to watch community replays and live matches between players) and a fully fleshed out League mode means having a persistent team  that competes against other players is definitely the way to play. You also get quite a few races to choose from, Humans, Bretonnians, Dark Elves, High Elves, Dwarfs, Chaos, Orkz, Skaven and even Lizardmen (or Wood Elves). Still, I'd like to see the other races in the game as well, especially the Undead, Vampire Counts and Tomb Kings.My biggest complaints with the game are in the features the game is missing as opposed to Chaos Edition. For example, there is no real-time mode, there is no World Cup mode or tournament mode. It really focuses on the League mode between players. Essentially, if you have no friends or don't like playing competitively, there isn't much for you to do. It would also be nice if there were more animations overall.Gameplay Footage (Still processing):

												For the curious: Blood Bowl 2â is a turn-based tactical combat game, loosely based around American Football, played with the fantasy races from Warhammer, and with X-COM style persistent characters.  (They gain skills, injuries, death.) It's a gorgeous, rules-perfect (nit-picks aside) adaptation of the 30-year-old board game.  It is goofy and stupid and fun while also providing quite a bit of strategic depth, if you have the stomach for dice-rolling (and don't get too attached to your players).  I have sunk entirely too many hours into this game.			"

												An absolutely fantastic adaptation of the tabletop game. A handful of changes, but Cyanide have been very open to the community and are implementing some great changes in the upcoming expansion.A few diehard Blood Bowl fans may be taken aback by the inclusion of the not-quite-traditional race Bretonians, or critical of the slight changes to individual positional costs and stats. However, I do not mind these little quirks, as the platform offers a great way to get your game on!			"

If you like turn based strategy and team management games I'd definitely reccommend this game to you.  It does have its issues, but the developer is putting significant effort in to fixing the bugs and adding additional features since September.

												Great game, has some issues but developers are working on fixing and improving.I haven't played Blood Bowl before, but now I can say that the game itself is fantastic and I very much love the graphics and animations in this game, the UI is also very clear and it shows the percantage chance of sucess on every action, making taking risks a lot easier for players new to the game like me.There are only 8 races in the base game included, so if you don't care how the game looks and can deal with the old UI maybe you should consider picking up blood bowl chaos edition.However, they gave the first two DLC races away for free (for early adopters) and now have announced that the upcoming next 4 races will be free as well.

												Buy it on sale for 50% or more.  It is often on sale at that price.  Game looks great and feels like an improvement in every way.  I haven't played very long so I will update my review if I encounter any issues.  Only thing i've seen so far is the subtitles of the announcers are off pretty often when they speak but its not a big deal.I debated buying this for a few days because of the lousy option to buy extra teams for 6 plus usd.  That is a crazy price in my opinion.  I'm not opposed to what they are doing as the orginal took 2 expansions before you had all the teams but additional teams would be much more appealing at the price of 2 bucks.  So I will just wait til they go on sale.  If you buy the game now before the release of the next 4 races you get them for free.  I think that is a decent price....about 20 dollars  (at 50% off) and you are getting half of the total teams most likely...then just wait for a sale on the rest of the teams.   I think the game is worth it when it is on sale for 50% or more.			"

												You will read many reviews of BB2, either from crazed fans or from endless complainers, sometimes from both at the same time.Both have their reasons, of course: complainers mostly focus on the fact that the game seems ""unfinished"", that it lacks many teams that were present in BB1 (and the DLC is coming in quite slow), that many small eye candies are unfinished (like cheerleaders being all mummified human dolls in blue) and so many other issues that they will be glad to point out for you.But before deciding whether to buy or not the game, silence the nay-sayers a bit. Listen to the crazed fans for a moment. To those that still find more than satisfying getting home after a long day at work, grab a ball and get lost in the rush of a Blood Bowl game!If you know Blood Bowl, you will feel at home. If you never played Blood Bowl, this is your ticket into the madness.And if you decide to trust the developers *now*, they will be motivated to fix all the small (and, frankly, irrelevant - the game is great already!) issues that bother the complainers so much.

												I waited to buy into BB1 for a variety of reasons: (1) the way Cyanide essentially highway bandited my wallet on DE-LE-CE BB1; (2) BB2 has fewer race options than BB:CE and the races are currently relatively expensive DLC (although you only need to buy them to play AS a race, so they are optional); and (3) I wasn't convinced that Cyanide could produce a game that was superior enough to CE to be worth the upgrade.BB2 is a vastly superior product. The visuals, animations, UI, options... everything is better. The game is smooth and gorgeous. The DLC model, while expensive if you want to play as every race, is fair in that people like me who deliberately chose not to buy early aren't being rewarded vs. those who did yet we can still play against those teams.The league management options are also improved, although I haven't dug into multiplayer yet. The AI is actually worse than BB1 if you can believe it, so don't expect a long term single player experience out of BB2.Pleasantly surprised with BB2 all things considered. It makes you wish we had this product 7 years ago when BB1 launched and we started up the OFL.			"

												Amazing Turn-Based Strategy game, with a steep learning curve, rewarding those who don't get scared of RNG elements in the beginning. You should not hesitate to give it a shot. Most people who complain about the game being RNG horror and pure luck would call Poker the same. That being said, professional or experienced Poker players tend to turn luck in their favor with strategy, the same can be applied to this game.I own the game since launch and haven't had a single crash nor' did I see any bugs/glitches. There's a ton of in-depth guides online about pretty much every aspect of the game and all races since theres a huge community behind ""Blood Bowl"", (Tabletop/Online Java/BB1 and BB2 on Steam) that should make it easier for newcomers such as myself, if You like to dedicate time into reading them.--Pro's:- Balanced- Good graphics, running smooth on 3 year old hardware- No lags / no glitches / no bugs so far- Hot seat for 2 players (rare nowadays)- Huge game depthCon's:- The game itself is not newbie-friendly if you don't dedicate time into reading guides or ask experienced players for help- Match length can go up to 1-1,5 hours without the chance of pausing (Multiplayer)- RNG tends to scare off beginners, game not recommended for short tempered people--My final rating for Blood Bowl 2: 8.5/10			"

												Blood Bowl 2 is a hard game to review, because it very much depends on how you want to play. On balance I am saying yes to a recommendation because I have, and am, enjoying playing, and have had a decent number of enjoyable hours from it. That comes with the caveat that it's not going to be for everyone and it feels like it requires some reasonable commitment from the players. I have been a blood bowl fan, but hadn't played for many years, and had only played the tabletop versions before this; never any of the computer variants. For me, Blood Bowl 2 gives a reasonable way to play the game online, while not really providing much else. There are two real modes of the game; playing vs the AI or multiplayer games. Playing vs the AI is a fine way to play the game, and get a bit of practice in, but is not ultimately very challenging. If you are new to the game, I think the AI would be great, and a good way to learn the game, but there is a point where you will win every game, and there's not a lot more to learn from it. There is no difficulty setting, and the AI lacks a lot of basic strategy. Games vs other players becomes the game once you're half way decent, and is good if you're happy to schedule games and play regularly and be organised. Blood Bowl as a whole has a vibrant and friendly community, and joining their organised leagues is relatively easy. Organising private leagues with friends is better. If you want to pick up an odd game to play now and again though, you're left with the Cyanide Open League, which is... well it's a way to play a game but not much else. There's not enough players, which can sometimes lead to long waits if it's the wrong time of day, or mismatches where someone with a very high team value is matched against a new team. Inducements are not good enough to balance the issue. There's also no goal or point to the open league, it just runs as a way you can play your team. For me, it feels like a practice room, somewhere to take a team for a spin to find out how they play but ultimately not really somewhere you are competing. The open leagues feel like they need something more, like extra play modes, different competitions to enter and goals to strive for. Even something like a cosmetic rewards for winning a given number of games with a team - maybe win a new jersey, or get a trophy in a trophy cabinet. Extra play modes and different competitions is difficult though, because the player base isn't big enough - and without them I am not sure I can recommend the game to someone wanting to play on the open leagues. Something of a catch 22. There are things missing from the game; sponsorship doing something, teams are missing, the marketplace has basically no utility etc.Those aren't big factors to me but it feels like the game is incompete, and the developers are active if somewhat uncommunicative. For me, the game gets a thumbs up on balance, on the basis that you're happy organising games and playing the private leagues, with friends or online communities. It just feels like a bit of a missed opportunity. I like the game, I just can't love it.			"

												A long time fan of both the Table top and computer editions. I don't really see the niggly problems of the game, other than it isn't finished....is it? My main gripe comes with Steam putting on a sale barely 1 month after release...come on...this shows no respect for the fans who are gonna buy DLC's etc.....I was gutted to pay the full price, but did it to support the game......it's not got content for the SP to match this price tag, and MP doesn't interest me ... wait til the next markdown to buy...I am now only going to buy steam on sale..

												Crazy harsh RNG, a community that knows the woes of RNG and is more than willing to crack jokes with you about it during a bad game, goblin chucking, permanently killing or getting killed players. the only downside no rotter cheerleaders Nurgle needs some un sexy putrid lovelies in the cheering department or we can just wait until the crack addiction the human gals clearly have runs its course so sad, someone should start a kick starter to get them some help and rehab thatâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥isnât cheap. This game is for a lot of people IMO, but there is also a certain type of gamer that shouldnât play Blood Bowl and that is those that can't handle luck ruining a good strategy without getting to salty because it will happen you will also see bad starts plus good luck ruin your day.

												Take the negative reviews with a hefty pinch of salt.This game is plagued by people who are completely baffled by the concepts of RNG and probabilities and blame bad luck or the game being rigged for their poor grasp of tactics.While luck plays a part, at the end of the day, it is all about tactics and minimizing risk.Also it should be noted that Cyanide has made tremendous efforts to address the main criticisms of the community when the game was first released and most of the initial flaws have been ironed out.In a gaming world flooded with what I call junk games that'll you play for a week end or a week at most and then never touch again because they're so casual and shallow, you can spend years playing BB, it is incredibly rich and offers tons of replay value.

												Ah, Blood Bowl. A game in which bribery is rife and fouling is fine. A game in which a player must be carefully nurtured, thoughtfully assigned skills and then ruthlessly fired after a few seasons because he's inflating the team value. This is all assuming said player doesn't break his neck after being tripped by a particularly malevolent blade of grass. It's a game in which a medical professional's treatment options might either be accepting death or simply accepting death. It's a game in which you swap players through Nurgle's Rot and the Necromancer instead of swapping jerseys.It's the world's greatest game when your Orc Blitzer gets up off the ground, runs over to grab the ball at an opponent's feet, evades a tackle and then throws a pass for a touchdown. It's the world's worst when half your team suffers from heat stroke in a must-win match. (How does a zombie suffer from heat exhaustion anyway?)It's certainly a game for a niche audience. The game's complexity makes it a frustrating experience for new coaches. Expect a lot of ""why can't I ...?"" and ""how do I â¦?"" moments in the first dozen or so hours of play as the ruleset is filled with gotchas and exceptions. Since the game adheres closely to tabletop rules, The Living Rule Book is an essential read and new coaches would also do well to consult guides on bbtactics.com (one of gaming's great strategy sites) while leveling up players. There are laughable suggestions Blood Bowl is completely random and devoid of strategy. It's not. The game's strategy involves risk-management, canny positioning and deep understanding of the complex skill system to tilt the odds in your favour.Just as in any dice- or random number generator-heavy game, risk-management is essential. Make low-risk moves before attempting risky blocks or dodges. Gang up on opponents to improve the odds of success. Mark or foul dangerous opponents. Self-restraint will often be just as valuable as tactical acumen because sometimes the best move is not moving at all. And finally, plan for failure because Nuffle, god of dice and unintentional comedy, delights in tearing up your carefully laid plans.Victory will be all the more satisfying considering the forces arrayed against coaches:  the opposing coach (AI or human), fate and time. The game's AI is mediocre but it offers enough of a test for new coaches. New or experienced, coaches must contend with fate as represented by the RNG. While the odds can be improved with tactics and carefully crafted player and team builds, time is an implacable foe. If the referee blows for time, it doesn't matter how close you are to the end zone.Some would-be coaches will find it difficult to get past the fickleness of the RNG and the twiddling of thumbs while the opponent stalls and drags out matches that can't be won. Those who persevere will be rewarded with one of strategy gaming's great campaigns. There are few gaming experiences as enjoyable as taking a team of hapless butterfingered greenhorns and turning them into a battle-scarred team of champions over the course of several seasons.Still, the initial reviews for this latest adaptation of Blood Bowl were mixed and understandably so. The playerbase was irritated at having to pay extra for teams which were bundled together in previous editions, annoyed at being nickled and dimed for customisation skins and just as annoyed over missing customisation options. The publisher responded by giving away most of the DLC teams to early customers and this placated some but not all.It bears minding Blood Bowl 2 was developed by a small developer backed by a small publisher for a relatively small market. Of course, there's room for improvement and of course, the playerbase should push both developer and publisher to make those improvements but the question is, and has always been, whether the playerbase would be willing to fund ongoing development for a game that would benefit from continued attention.There's no getting around the fact a game like this will never be made by the likes of EA, Ubisoft and Activision. In the unlikely event a major publisher did pick up the Blood Bowl license, it would be so altered to appeal to a larger audience that it would scarcely be recognisable.(It would probably be a third-person shooter with unnecessary overlong cutscenes featuring Griff Oberwald attempting to avenge the death of his family at the hands of Varag Ghoul-Chewer.)The game as it stands is really good for what it is -- a relatively faithful adaptation of a cult favourite tabletop game -- and with the recent announcement of the Legendary Edition, with its laundry list of fan-requested features, the future looks bright indeed for Blood Bowl fans.Recommended for: anyone looking for a great turn-based strategy gaming campaign.Not recommended for: the ""RNG is broken"" school of strategic analysts.

												I've been playing Blood Bowl for years and have done almost everything there is to do. I've become an admin of a popular league and have spent hours trying different ways to build teams. This is my view of Blood Bowl 2 from a veteran of the game.Blood Bowl 2 is Cyanide's recreation of the original Blood Bowl games under a new engine. The graphics and UI are great and this new adaption makes it much easier for new players to get into the game. The tutorial does an alright job of explaining the game and mechanics, even if it could be improved and may be a little too slow. People complain about the lack of variation in cheerleaders and crowd but really how much do you care about that? They complain because it's not in the game and when it is they won't give it a second thought. The thing that matters most about Blood Bowl is the gameplay. After a shaky start with some skills not being optional or not being in the game Cyanide has done a good job with listening to the community and fixing the problems (hard to believe I know). Some people have noticed some bugs but I personally have had no problems.While there is a notable lack of a good single player as the campaign is largely a long tutorial, Blood Bowl was meant for multiplayer anyways. In NAF (COL) there is a wide variety of skill levels and tv so it's very good for practice, however the best way to play BB is in a league setting and that's where most of my experience will come from. Find a good group of people and have some set match times and you will have a blast with this game. The biggest downside of BB2 right now is the lower number of teams and I hope Cyanide picks up the pace with releasing them but that doesn't detract from the overall gameplay too much. If you don't care about the graphics or ui and just want a wide variety of teams, then by all means go play BB1. However if you want a more pleasing experience then buy BB2 as it has an insane amount of potential once more teams are released and giving your support will only make it better.			"

												Ah yes, Blood Bowl. A neckbeard's wet dream that features a fantasy universe coupled with a sport I pretend to like so my dad doesn't make fun of me. The moment I stepped in I was greeted with a much sleeker, easier to navigate menu and ui (compared to the first game). I went to create my team (Clan Neckbeard) and found a decent level of customization. If you compare the customization to something like an rpg, an mmo, or really a ""normal"" sports game, then you come up disappointed. However, compared to the original Blood Bowl, I would have needed a mod or two to end up with the same level of character customization. Upon creating my dwarf team I looked at the other 7 races. When reading reviews here, people seemed to complain about how Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition had 23 playable races so why are we down to 8. Well Blood Bowl originally launched with 8 races as well with Chaos Edition coming out roughly 3 years after vanilla launch. So yes, those extra 15 races were DLC; in essence the dlc is no worse than the original Blood Bowl except that all the dlc was bundled together a few years after launch for the first one.Hopping into the game is where you run into the bulk of the problems (which isn't saying much). Graphically speaking, the game is a huge improvement from BB1, however there are a few things I'd like to see changed. I would like to see more diverse animations (play a game with any race and you'll see all their animations very quickly) when blocking. Also, race-specific cheer-leaders and fans. The cheerleaders are all humans for every race which makes little sense. Also when a player gets knocked off the pitch he's beat up by the fans which, again, are the same 3 generic humans. If I'm playing in a dwarf arena, I want to see dwarves beat the crap outta some guy! After my game I found that there were basic endgame stats (# of armor breaks, injuries, MVP) but I didn't find the same in depth stat tracking I loved from BB1. From what people have said, there also seems to be little league customization, but I haven't tested that.I seem to notice a lot of people giving the game negative reviews for two reasons. 1)The reviews are old and they address problems that are no longer present in the game (such as no grid mode, no dice logs, and no singleplayer) or 2)people complaining about RNG. Yes this is a dice game and no matter how hard you try, no matter how amazing your players are, you can still get knocked down and die. That's the nature of the game.The problems I've found are minor there were no major bugs. There are some people that are salty their favorite race isn't in yet but just as with BB1 I'm sure they'll get released in decent sized DLC. At the end of the day, it's the same Blood Bowl I know and love and it's expanded its horizons to attract newer players to the series while still offering veterans their Blood Bowl fix. 8/10 would dwarf again.

												This game is a shame, I love Blood Bowl. I have owned the table top Blood Bowl since 1986 and have avidly played Blood Bowl Chaos edition and with the graphics, the smoothness of play and the promise of a better AI and more management tools this seemed like it would be the best thing ever. IT IS NOT.Blood Bowl 2 is at best ready for an extended beta-release, the number of game play bugs pile up by the day and Cyanide seems to have abandoned the support forums. There is no word on any of the many,many,many too numerous to fix bugs are being worked on and there is no acknowledgement from Cyanide that anything to fix Blood Bowl 2 is happening.Add that to the inexplicable changes to races/players, beefed up human catchers that have no cost increase, impotent Chaos Warriors and an AI that can only win if it stacks the die rolls impossibly in it's favor and this game is a sham that shouldn't even be called Blood Bowl.Add to that Cyanides ignoring of the LRB and their seemingly pointless tinkering at minor rules and gameplay instead of focusing on fixing the numerous bugs and this game mystifies as to why it was released.I want to love this game, but I don't and I find myself frustrated at something that could have been so good so inexplicably ruined. I think the only thing that could save this game is to take it out of Cyanides hands, they have completely lost the script.Unless you have never played any other iteration of Blood Bowl, or if you hated the other versions do not buy this game.UPDATE: I'm really, really trying to love this game, I've added another 22 hours of game play and if anything it is buggier last week and this week than it was before.Unlike other players I've never had crashes, just annoying game play bugs, but now the game is 'Black Screening' about 45% of the time. You can hear the game going on and see the cursor but the screen is blank and windows shows the game as 'Not Responding' it's been happening to lots of players and the BB2 support forums have multiple multi post threads about it and SURPRISE! No input from Cyanide at all.Game Devs: Read these reviews closely, this how you destroy a uch loved, highly anticipated game.			"

												Recommended.I understand that there are a lot of negative reviews since in the beginning the game was a little unpolished. But with the patches and the trickle of team releases it is becoming a solid game. Very true to the board game. The graphics are eons better than Chaos Edition and the animations are superb. I like the cruching blows and satisfying feeling you get when succefully blocking and breaking the opponents armor.Also to all those that say Cyanide is milking the players by slowly releasing teams I really disagree. It tages an immense amount of time and money to make all the different animations of every team. They could of course have chosen to release the game with all teams having some static or default movement animation, but the charm of it is that every team is uniquely different in every way.If you need tactical help and team builing/leveling tips visit this site: http://www.bbpb.de/ "

												So, Bloodbowl 2 is good for a first time player. I came here from crendor and a meaningful sale of 50% off. So I came in here not expecting the best of the best. What I got though was ana aamazing turn based dice throwing stragegy game with an amazing theme. To me, it is one of the best turn based stragegy games I have ever played. From having roll of all skulls on a three dice turn or all defender down on a red roll. It is fun and infuriating at times. It took me a few teams to get a stragy going but after that the game opened it's legs for me. I don't know about the vets coming in but as a new player, I solemly recommend this amazing game.			"

												Right now, blood bowl 2 is in a bad state. Not graphically, or in the sound department, both are pretty well fleshed out for what they are. Gameplay holds very stable, especially if you arriving from the first one. The percentages that it now displayed is unchanged from the old system Blood Bowl chaos edition did with the dice to a much easier to get d6 that was confusing to many players first starting.The issue primarily plaguing this game is its meta. This is a very well rough spot, for its role as fantasy football. You  play based on defined styles from the race you choose. Currently, one aspect of the team in question here has reached a nasty point of contention within the community. The defenders of this are going to tell you ""Play a different team."" when you encounter this team makeup. Normally, this is a fine aspect. The team in question has a means to do this, and its used to deal with certain persisting aspects of your team after the game. And losing half to three quarters of a team you spent time and energy into because of this matchup.Death happens in this game for some teams, death happens alot more for others. But when you get roaming kill teams to face that exist to ruin your game, rather then win, is it a good thing? And that is the big problem right now to why I can't recomend this game. Cyanide is starting to give the tools to make sure you can avoid losing your team to this, but you cant avoid it fully yet. If it goes through, i'd gladly change my review to positive. But anyhow, have a good day.If you are reading this, then you've either crawled to where it was vote bombed down, or looking to reviews. In which case either way, thank you.			"

												If youâve never encountered this series, Blood Bowl would be best described as fantasy American football. But not the version in which you pick your dream team out of the best players of today, but instead a league made up of the various races from the Warhammer universe. Originally a miniatures board game, Blood Bowl had a few digital iterations and today we have before us the latest one with a â2â added to itâs title. At itâs core, this is a faithful adaptation of the board game. Two teams numbering 11 players fight over ball possession during 16 rounds (8 in each half-time) in an attempt to score by crossing the opponentâs touchdown line with the ball. Unlike the real sport that inspired the game, this nets your team only one point and there are no kicks afterwards. And probably the most important difference â fights are not only allowed, but are encouraged.While the six-sided dice and random elements might be integral to the game, youâll still have plenty of ways to skew the odds in your favor and avoid turnovers that force you give up your turn (by dropping the ball or having your player tackled). The basic systems might seem complicated at the start and the gameâs manual can only be read on the website. So, to get you started, thereâs a campaign in which you lead a human team, Reikland Reavers, through a hilarious story of trials and tribulations of this once-great team and through which youâll get to learn how the game works. Each match introduces one new mechanic, from basic passing to stadium upgrades. While the campaign is great, itâs tutorial part crawls fairly slowly because in Blood Bowl 2 the matches can sometimes take 20-30 minutes.Compared to the previous game, Blood Bowl not only looks fantastic, but there are no obvious problems or bugs. The atmosphere during the matches is ecstatic, partly due to the kooky commentating duo of Bob and Jim (an ogre and a vampire) who comment for CabalVision in a typical TV style, but mostly for the excellent art style and high detail of models on the field. Itâs absolutely tremendous when your successful moves get replayed in slow motion close-up, while the audienceâs cheers drown out the commentators. Blood Bowl 2 is a game that is hard not to recommend, especially if the idea of rugbyâ¦ erm â American football featuring orcs, dwarves, elves and other Warhammer races sounds like a great pass-time to you, and you donât mind getting used to a somewhat complex tactical system.Full review here: http://play-zine.com/2015/10/review-blood-bowl-2/ "

												I played 70 hours with BBCE and like 100-150 hours with my non-steam BB and BBLE. So let's cut to the chase....It is an absolute rip-off! If you have Blood Bowl LE or CE you shouldn't buy this. They sell the same game basically the fourth time but now we don't get a proper selection for races, but we get clunky controls and playability, irritating menu and worst handling I've ever met in in a ""tabletop"" game.I go back to BBCE and will try a refund on this. I was lucky it was on sale. Shame, this game really shouldn't exist!			"

												Everything Blood Bowl 1 did right i.e. Customization, real time leagues, playing with a friend in leagues, ect. they ruined or just took out altogether, and everything Blood Bowl 1 did wrong they made even worse i.e. Broken dice RNG, team pros and cons not mattering at all, play styles that don't focus on the ball just lose, ect.I would stick with the first one, it has about the same amount of players and is simply the better game. Not to mention it's cheaper.			"

												Never played Blood Bowl 1 and I feel most negative votes come from people that have, rating this game on its own it's pretty good, really like how the teams feel different and you can defintely not play the same as the elves as you do with the orks.Games are long which some people consider to be a bad thing but I really enjoy it since I can really get into the game. They have been releaseing new updates which have increased the number of teams which all who had the game got for free +1They clearly want to make this a good game and they are still working on it improving different features.The perma death and injuries system make this game much more strategic that one would have thought at first, decisions have to be made carefully. In any case there are offline leagues as well in case you just want to try out different teams and tactics without having to worry much about the players			"

												Blood Bowl 2 is a game that wants to celebrate the nostalgia of the original tabletop version, while also offering players a little something new to go along with it. The aim of the game is pretty simple, players need to score the most Touchdowns!! Of course, itâs not as simple as that however, as there are increasingly-difficult teams standing in your way. Timing your run as well as creating the right situation to give your team the advantage, all while a timer is counting down, is crucial to whether or not you end up scoring those Touchdowns!! And lest not forget the repetitive failed dice rolls, which will be something that people will hate.That being said, the game looks great and plays well. I do recommend it to anyone, so long as you have a little patience and a handle on your temper, failed dice rolls will make you scream at your monitor.			"

												I gave this game a fair go, really. I understand it's a dice game, I understand its random. However today this happened. My LVL6 Witch Elf, with sure footed, on elf turf to mitigate injury, died while going for it.Yes I had 2 Apothecaries because I was playing against Dwarves, however. Before I had the chance to use the Apoth the game crashed.Because this game is an unfinished pile of trash (and that's being kind).You still can't, in twenty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ fifteen, log back into a match after disconnect.So I have uninstalled and will never play a BB game again. Even ignoring this situation, the game has a plethora of other problems, bugs, compatibility issues, connection stability etc.Currently as of the time of this review only 1200 (as if that isnt already an indication not to buy) people are playing BB2 at peak time. I dont play at peak time, neither does the majority of the planet. I'm forced to play EURO and US players from SEA and wait 20-30 per movement while the server catches up. Also if this causes a DC, you cant get back into your match. That is unacceptable. I'm not even going to get into gameplay and balance. Suffice to say all you need to do is check every single league leader board and see undefeated Chaos and Lizardmen on every one. Most of their victory's come from concedes by the way (you can check). Since nobody wants to struggle keeping players alive rather than playing the damn game. The perma death and injury system has driven away the entire player base. I enjoy an amount of randomness in my gaming, it is exciting. However this game is over the top. The amount of chance involved takes away all notion of a skilled player having an effect on the outcome of a game. You always do the most sensible stuff possible to succeed and still get â¥â¥â¥â¥ed over by rolls. IF this game were more along the lines of X-Com, where a skilled player can have an actual impact on keeping important pieces alive, then I would continue playing. This game does not give you that chance. Your best players can die from the most simple and likely to succeed action. That is ridiculous and makes this game feel more like a chore than anything else.All that is left here are the bash team trolls. ""Can't think so we just hurt stuff."" See ya never.			"

												Oh how I wish there was a ""kind of"" option for reviews.I have nothing to say that hasn't been said before. The concept behind both computer adapatations of bloodbowl is brilliant, however both of these adaptations have problems that are large enough to be deal breakers for many people.Bloodbowl 1 has the worlds worst â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ interface. Its so bad it borders on unplayable if the player isn't familiar or willing to spend the first 5-10 hours trying to figure out what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ they're doing. It's graphics are pretty crap, and it's a game that hasn't really aged with grace.Bloodbowl 2, for some reason, decided to only include like 5 races on launch, and then charge $6 for each additional race. Just for some perspective Bloodbowl Chaos Edition gives you 22 races from the get go. Coding AI for strategy games is pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ tough, because you need to be able to make the computer out-wit a player who is engaging in an inately cerebral activity. So instead of making good AI, the folks at Cyanide just made mediocre AI that gets â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t RNG and numerical advantages. All of that being said the games are still played by a bajillion people, and will be played by a bajillion people forever. Thats because if you can climb over the UI, shimmy past the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ AI, and buy the DLC on sale or something, the game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fantastic. Its an incredibly rewarding tactics game with all of the punch of a sports game, the story telling ability of Dwarfort, and a depth rivalling chess.So yes I recommend this game. I do it with a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of caveats, because the game is not for everyone. However there are some of you that will fall in love with this game, and you'll join the ranks of steam users who have clocked 500+ hours.			"

												Although when the game orginally came out, I felt cheated by Cyanide Studios. Having played 300 hours of Chaos Edition, the lack of teams was disappointing. I honestly felt the game had little to no hope. However, almost a year later, coming back to the game to find out teams have been added, and Legendary Edition is being released later this year, I felt compelled to try the game again. And you know what? It was better than I remembered. The new cut scenes and greater detail in the game allow you to get increasingly more emerged in the game. It was everything (well almost everything, lacking the Team Editor and the other teams) I loved about Chaos Edition, and added extras. However you can tell the game was orginally rushed to be released. Little details, such as a lack of stadiums (something which Blood Bowl has always backed imo!) and the only cheerleaders being zombie-esk humans in Reikland uniforms was disappointing, especially considering you can see updated skins of the cheerleaders from Chaos Edition, and previous editions, in the crowd  at times(the one that stands out the most is the Orc cheerleader). The little details they skimped out on annoyed me, but that may be because I enjoyed the previous games so much.So to conclude, if you have played the previous editions of Blood Bowl - hold out on buying Blood Bowl 2 until they release Legendary Edition. If you are new to Blood Bowl I would recommend getting Blood Bowl 2 before they add the rest of the teams to the game with Legendary Edition.			"

												Personally I find the Warhammer universe pretty dumb, and sportsball really isn't my thing. But as far as turn based tactical games go, especially boardgame adaptions, this is a pretty fine game. 7/10 - would stomp on downed opponents again. Not a full price recommend unless you are passionate about warhammer stuff, but definitely a pick-up-on-sale for turn based tactical folk. Word of warning though, it's deceptively complex and tough to play despite how dumb it looks.			"

												[Updated oct. 2016]UPDATE: I find myself going back to the game once in a while, when I'm not in the mood for anything too demanding, and I found it was time to update this... Because... I've given up now. Can't deal with my issue 4 (below) not being dealt with. Just totally inexcusable in my book.Still disappointed. Love Games Workshop worlds and games. Really liked the updated graphics, but the interface is the first disappointment... It's NOT intutive. I think it's fine with some experimenting or letting people choose other setups, but you shouldn't be forced to ""learn"" their new setup.UPDATE: I've gotten used to the interface, still not sold on it. Single player campaign is... very stretched out... and too short... How is that possible? Well it introduces one rule per game pretty much, which means that to players who know Blood Bowl you're basically playing one extremely long tutorial. And then short; because after the campaign itself you can only make single player leagues. No progression or different tournaments as in the first Blood Bowl.Then the REALLY big letdowns:1. 6 or so races? WHAT? And extra races at around 1/6 of the full price game per race is just outrageous?! When I found this out, I tried to get my money back, but you can only do that after playing a max of 2 hrs... So having played a bit more, well...UPDATE: More races are comming and free for all now... Ok... Should have been this way all along...2. Extremely counterintuitive setup of leagues. Why is there only one way to do everything. I mean... It's horribly set up. Really. Never seen a setup I had such a hard time figuring out how to get through.UPDATE: You'll get used to it, but still... really annoying interface :-)3. WHY can't you set up more than one player managed team in an offline league with computer teams. A lot of players asked for this as an update to the first game and they didn't introduce it in this sequel.UPDATE: STILL missing. Biggest letdown along with the next one!UPDATE: 4. No saves in single player during a match... You HAVE to finish an entire game in one session. No save at half time. I honestly didn't write about this in my first review, because I was sure it would be implemented in one of the first updates. So if you're not single... forget it. This game is not for you... Kids. You need to get rid of them if you want to play... The choice must be because ""they"" don't want people to hack save files, but... jeeeez. This only affects those that do not cheat. Cheaters will cheat. Those who have a life, can't play... Thanks a lot... In summary: Don't buy unless you are single, have no job, and don't mind starting the same match several times...So disappointed...			"

Posted: December 25, 2015
												As a long time player of tabletop games related to this genre, I was drawn into this game by some fun videos on YouTube.I wish the general community was as fun as the people who play on YouTube...Pros - GW has a real knack for a sort of gallows humor and tongue in cheek style that somehow manages to be both dark and silly at the same time. It lends itself well to games that actually grew out of war simulations. The two narrators are entertaining, as GW characters are wont to be, and Cyanide I feel did a wonderful job capturing the flavor of the game.Cons - 1. The UI is clunky. There is no entirely safe way to plan your moves. Misclicks result in anything from having to start all over to having your player throw the ball across the field when you did not intend it. 2. The teams are not particularly well balanced. This goes back to it being a GW game. GW, for those of you now aware, stands for Games Workshop. This is a company that just abandoned a decades old wargame franchise seemingly specifically to spite a sector of their customer base they apparently considered harmful for their sales. We'll see how that works out. Meantime, Blood Bowl 2 sports a handful of the teams available in the semi-official (I.E. not at all supported by GW for decades now) tabletop rules. Skaven are all but unplayable. Chaos seem to rule the leagues based on the fact that they have access to an entirely separate set of upgrades that other races can only rarely access (mutations). Skaven can get them fairly easily too, but Skaven die in higher levels in truckloads with an armor value of 7 even on front line players. As the game rewards survival of multiple games heavily, Skaven and other low armor, high finesse teams find it hard to compete at higher levels of play. At least one private league now invites ONLY finesse teams into its league to avoid the devestation the high armor and high strength teams visit on their weaker cousins. There is no cure for this imbalance in sight. My experience with GW - players and designers alike - is that making the game balanced and competative is not really high on their list of things to do. Wonder if Cyanide can break that trend? So far, the answer is no.3. The graphics are pathetic. This game offered little in the way of graphics to begin with. It is a standard sort of top down view with very clunky camera control. But to make matters worse, players move about stiffly, often ending up somewhere other than where you aimed them only to slip into place like a loose block, and the handful of full screen animations that pop up typically sport part of one player poking through the other player because of bad positioning of the camera and/or models during the animation render.At one point the game reversed the team uniforms between my Skaven and the opposing Skaven team...?In short, just old fashioned sloppy graphics and animation work. 4. The community is not nearly as friendly as the YouTube videos that seem to be the main marketing arm for the game would lead you to think. Summary: Nice idea, but the execution is predictably pathetic as GW tends to just pawn its IP off to whoever is willing to fork over the money and let the chips fall where they may. There has never in the history of GW been anything remotely resembling quality control as far as their game rules go. They make wonderful miniatures and great game fluff, but horribly horrible games. And their company is quite obviously struggling because of it.In any event, I would definitely not recommend this game. The lack of balance between the teams and the clunky UI have left me entirely uninterested in continuing play, and like so many GW fans, the player base seems to be a bunch of rabid dogs whose main function in life is to convince people to play games with them by treating them like crap and pretending there's nothing wrong with the game's design or execution.   Caveat - There are those who accuse me of being ""Sausage fingered"". I seem to do well enough in pretty much every other video game I play though. I'm pretty sure this is just the typical GW fanboy reaction to anything negative you ever say about their games, but in the interest of fairness, there are apparently people who just LOVE the UI. I can't imagine why, and they are none too communicative as to WHY they think the UI rocks, but there you have it. Maybe my fingers turn to sausages specifically for GW games.			"

												If you play Blood Bowl for the Multiplayer then you can ignore most of the negative reviews on steam as they all seem to be written by people who just wanted Singleplayer.For those who are focused on the multiplayer side of Blood Bowl, Blood Bowl 2 is a MASSIVE improvement over the first.  Everything from league management over team management to actual playing in leagues and competitions comes with better and clearer UI and is much more user friendly than Blood Bowl 1 with its horribly dated and janky interface.It comes with 8 races and comparing that to Chaos Edition is a little ridiculous as Chaos Edition was the 4th RERELEASE of the original Blood Bowl, the basic version of which also came with 8 races. If you are in it for the singleplayer you can still get basic randomized competitions and a story campaign featuring the Reikland Reavers. This campaign also includes a tutorial which means the first couple of matches aren't ""real"" Blood Bowl matches but ones with simplified rules. Toward the end the difficulty really rises up though and it's a neat story with a lot of memorable characters from the Blood Bowl lore.  All in all the Singleplayer is perhaps not as fulfilling as the offering in Blood Bowl 1, I can't really comment on that much because I don't play this game for its Singleplayer or GW's ridiculous ""lore"".One thing that Blood Bowl 2 is not however is a buggy mess like Blood Bowl 1 was for years. A fact that all the Chaos Edition fanboys seem to conviniently forget.			"

												A game very hard to grasp and to understand, but if you like tactics games, sports and a funny violent medieval-fantastic universe, Blood Bowl is going to give it to you. Moreover, a lot of guide can be easily found on the net and will help you to improve your understanding of the strategy behind the game. Don't be fooled by the advisertisement campaign, this game needs to hold on tight to truly appreciate it. Even if being unlucky can be very very bothering, stay till in the end on the pitch and you'll see how the Blood Bowl is mannered. Most of coaches will give you advice, praise you for the good game and admit when they got very lucky (and will also apologize, event though it's Nuffle's fault) for injuring/killing your players.

												The game, while tactically very fun, is slow; opponent AI turns take between 1 and 2.5 minutes; end result is that I find something else to do while my (AI) opponent takes its turn.But that doesn't make it a bad game, it just makes it a slow game. The negative recommendation is related to saving.1. You cannot save in the middle of a match. Period. Combine that with the aforementioned slowness of the game (call it 4 minute rounds, and 16 rounds in a match), and you're looking at losing up to an hour of gameplay if you have to leave before the end.2. Having just played an aforementioned hour-long match (which I enjoyed very much!), the game simply did not record the progress. I was taken back to the Solo League screen, with the same opponent I had just played, and none of the gained stats.Such a simple concept should not be simply not allowed (saving a game), nor should it straight up fail to save progress in the rare instance that your progress is recorded. That's pretty silly.			"

Product received for free
												Great, fun game with a lot of customization and variety in terms of players and teams.So why is it not recommended? Because from experience it's Bethesda levels of glitchiness and whilst Bethesda generally has the courtesy to fix bugs and glitches post-release, Cyanide has neglected to fix the ""black screen"" crash where the game after running perfectly on a relatively old but powerful machine (i5 3570, 8GB RAM, GTX 670 can run Witcher 3, ArmA 3, Overwatch, Fallout 4 etc. on high settings very well) crashes to black yet you could still hear the game going on yet you cannot interact with the game. Whilst this is not an issue in most games, due to a lack of a midgame save feature for singleplayer and bot matches this results in you losing the progress you've made in the game AND the experience points (or in Blood Bowl terms SPP) you've accumulated throughout the match. This is incredibly frustrating and is not helped by the fact that Blood Bowl is a game based around dice rolls meaning that you may not get those rightfully earned experience points again during the rematch. Also noted is that against the bots, the bot's AI timer sometimes gets stuck on 0:00 meaning that the game is unable to progress as there is no way to force the bot to end their turn. Again it may not sound like a big deal but imagine playing a game of chess where after 30 minutes (and still waiting), your opponent hasn't made their turn and it just so happens that you were winning that game. Sounds frustrating? That's Blood Bowl 2 for you and it's unexcusable. All of these problems have been well documented by the community and reported on the forums yet these bugs remain unfixed despite over a years worth of bug reports. As it stands, as great of a game as Blood Bowl 2 is. I cannot recommend it due to its bugginess being on the same level of Bethesda's games at launch, and this is a turn based strategy game and not an open world RPG.tl;dr game is buggy as hell, fix up your game CyanideEDIT: As of the 26th of December, even after using unofficial community methods of ""fixing"" the game such as http://forum.bloodbowl-game.com/viewtopic.php?f=90&t=8004 or deleting config files as well as official methods of fixing the game such as updating drivers. The game still black screen crashes frequently. Again using Fallout 4 as a benchmark since it is a game that is widely known for stability issues. My experience with Bethesda's open world RPG was not as crash happy as Blood Bowl 2 (which is a turn based strategy game) and that was after I loaded the game with a lot of unofficial mods which affected the stability and performance of the game.

Anyway the game came out and i started playing and just felt deflated.....don't get me wrong, it looks great, the animations are fun (you'll turn them off after a few games!), the AI seems improved, the campaign is awful, so everything i expected from BB2. Thats the problem though, its exactly how i thought it would be, its just BB in video game form, nothing new or exciting, the continuing lack of 'random events' and 'dirty tricks' continues to frustrate! Within a few hours i just got bored......would i recommend the game, yes if you like BB you'll like this, but otherwise.....			"

												After playing an Old World League Season, having a human team that managed to survive the never fail blocking, dodging and picking up of the AI, with only 2 losses and 3 deaths, my first game in the post season is against a Dark Elf team that supposedly won 9 games yet still has a fan factor of Zero and has 5 linemen with Guard (strength skills that they require a double on level up to get), and three other stat adjustments in the roster. My Ogre got a double and has block , I have a lineman with strength 4 and only two of my blitzers have guard.There is something seriously wrong with the level assignments of the AI teams and the always Zero Fan Factor means that supposed parity of the teams is achieved by giving the AI more skills and stat rolls to achieve a closer team rating which completely unbalances the game as they recieve up to 100 points in team rating and stats as against your up to 10 points of fan factor which gives you nothing.

												The following are the ONLY two features that aren't a step back from Chaos or Legendary edition:- Direct steam invites for multiplayer- Better graphicsThat's it. EVERYTHING else is a big step back from Chaos & Legendary. Tons of little things from the interface to the feedback to the camera that really start adding up (especially the announcers, holy crap did they become unfunny in this version).But most of all, the roster is a joke. A grand total of 8 races compared to the 20+ you get out of the box with the cheaper previousi games. New races are slowly being added...as DLC for $6 a pop. Maybe after 2 more years and $150 this game will be as good as Blood Bowl 1 is right now for $10?			"

												So far Blood Bowl 2 is living up to all of my expectations and surpassing more then a few. First a word of warning to those reading reviews there are two bits of misinformation i have seen on this steam page and i want to point that out real quick.1. Blood bowl 2 does not have fewer races it has the exact same amount has blood bowl 1 so watch out for dishonesty there as they both started with 8.2. Blood bowl 2 does not have day one dlc the lizardmen and wood elf teams were not finished when the game was (also they are not part of the originial BB2 8 bringing the total to 10 whenever they are added)Anyways now that thats out of the way here is my take and first the good.â¢Graphically this game is a massive improvement it is absolutely gorgeous in comparison to the graphics of the rather aging blood bowl 1.â¢The UI though is bar far the biggest improvement and in ever way both the games menu system and the in match ui are simply astounding i think it would not be unfair to call it a 100% improvement over the originial where the UI was the most dodgey aspect of the game.â¢The information, this may sound odd but blood bowl one wasn't always that good at telling you what was going on. Blood bowl 2 gives you easy to find data and critical info like the chance to dodge or pass or catch.â¢The next big mention is the multiplayer in blood bowl 1 getting into and setting up leagues was a hassle and now it is rather seamless. â¢It is also worth mentioning this game performs exceptionally well in fact it strangely enough peforms better then blood bowl 1, i get a more steady framerate from it then i did from its originial at the time. (not to mention you can actually alt tab thank god...)â¢Lastly the attention to detail is really good, everything feels visceral from the animations to the quality work of the models and the envrioment.Now for the Bad.â¢There is some missing fluff, the biggest place i have seen this is in the lack of race specific cheerleaders. I would consider this a minor con as to be honest in all my years of playing blood bowl i rarely ever cared about cheerleaders they often aren't worth the investment. So i can understand why the dev team put less of a focus on them given that the playerbase largely ignores them. Its also worth noting you get to have your own stadium which helps to replace that home team feel that the cheerleaders sometimes provided.â¢I have also heard there is no visual progression outside mutations for leveling up players though i cannot confirm that yet  and that is about all the bad i have found.Now the iffy. â¢Bretonians instead of Goblins. It's hard to say if this is a good thing or a bad thing. On one hand goblins offered a unique style of play centered around cheating. Currently no team really offers that in the same way (except for the dwarfs but that is a stretch). The other side of the coin is the fact that goblins are not a competitive team but a ""fun"" team where as Bretonians are clearly a competitive team. â¢So im tossing this one up to opinion, if you wanted more competitive teams in the initial roster then goods news for you! If you were hoping for more ""slapstick"" teams in the roster then i am sad to say you will have to wait for anything beyond dwarves.			"

												Well as a huge fan of of the original game it saddens me to not be able to reccomend BB2.Pros: Graphically much improved from the first game.Entertaining dialogues in the career mode even if it is over in a blink. Cons:Game is hard for the wrong reasons. The first one was hard because you were taking a bloody 900 rated team and bashing it into a 1200 rated team. This game is hard because you take your 1400 rated team and play a 1000 rated team and you watch as every.single. roll. goes thier way. I'm all for RNG and it adds a lot of complexity to the gameplay but whatever bonus there is to the ai rolls is absolutely infuriating at times.Its annoying to watch as your player gets tripped twice and you waste a re-roll, and then have the ai Magically move 6 players with no problem with a 33% chance or lower each move. To me this kills the original base for playing the game. Whats the point of spending time strategizing how to protect the carrier when the 1 opponant who magically gets by the 4 defenders ko's him and when i have the ai carrier completely surrounded, lone behold its like 50/50 if he actually goes down.There is an astounding lack of content for the price.Customization is at an all time low. Individual player customizations are only a handful and team customization is almost non existent. What could be considered ""customization"" is procedural stadium upgrades and additional dlc.If this title was 15$ I would say yeah give it a go, but as it's currently priced its a massive dissapointment. Some Ideas that would make me feel like I actually spent my money well.1. This game has a huge cult following.Open up the game to the steam workshop and let the players help you create the customizable content for the teams,players, and stadiums. Heck even have them be able to create entire teams and leagues as playing versus generated bot teams without a real world impact feel is something thats seriously missing from the first.2. If you do the above, run daily leagues that provide a chest or package depending on your final position that gives you epic loots to customize your teams/players			"

Posted: July 26, 2016
												I came from blood bowl 1 so to me this is an amazing 2nd game considering how much they improved on the first game.I'll say right away i probably wouldn't have played it as much as i did if i didn't stream it for 2 weeks straight with some eager viewers that wanted to get into blood bowl or wanted to watch some of the random aspects that sometimes can make the difference between winning and losing.This game is hard, unforgiving and can be frustrating at times due to the dice rolling aspect and there is a decent amount to learn if you have never played a blood bowl game before but if you can learn the basics and enjoy the idea of lvling up a team, upgrading your stadium and managing what you think is most important to add to your team.That is a big part of why i like it, but the meat of the game is the matches where you setup your players to create tackle zones, protect ball carriers, make perfect throws that go past half the field or simply punch opponents into the crowd and watch the spectators kill the opponents players or who knows? Maybe they will get greedy and try to run a little further than they can so they slip and die from the fall.I recommend it because i think if you are into this kind of game and can get past the learning curve which is relatively simple if someone breaks it down for you then this is a really satisfying game to play both against ai and other people even if you are on the unlucky side of things sometimes.

												Blood Bowl 2 is a better version of the previous PC release in every way except number of teams.  The new UI conveys information much more clearly. An added campaign mode holds the new coach's hand with a series of games that gradually introduce the more advanced concepts of Blood Bowl.   The negatives I can see have nothing to do with the game itself.  Blood Bowl 2 is not an action game. It is a recreation of the tabletop down to the dice rolls.   Do not purchase the game thinking it plays something like mutant league football.  Also understand that while there are open leagues for matchmaking, Blood Bowl is not balanced for perpetual leagues with many players.  The structure of open online makes it very easy to make ""overpowered"" teams.  If you do play, your time will be better spent in player-organized leagues where you can learn the game and build up rivalries.			"

												Great game. This coming from a veteran of the tabletop game, stretching back to the 1st and 2nd editions in the 80s.Played plenty of Chaos Edition, but much prefer this version. Amongst other things, it feels more epic. Thankfully we no longer have to play matches In an empty field or on a stupid boat!Also, I can get a random match always within seconds. True, the open league has its own issues, but that's another conversation entirely. With Chaos Edition I would have to set the matchmaker going and go off and do something else instead. More often than not it wouldn't even find me an opponent. Really frustrating.Sure, BB2 isn't  perfect. It needs more races, especially to keep the Chaos teams a bit more under control. Thankfully the new teams that are on their way should do that. Personally, all my favorite  teams are already in the game (apart from maybe Norse), so I can't really complain.Would like to see race/specific cheerleaders, and some variation on the crowd members when a player is surfed. Would also like to see player models develop as players earn levels. That was a nice touch in Chaos Edition. Overall, buy this game. There is a strong community, particularly in private leagues and will only get stronger with the introduction of the upcoming new races, plus the World Cup of course.			"

												Blood Bowl 2! A game in the Warhammer universe and all about football, dice rolls, skill, LUCK (mostly this kind lady) and how best you can kill the other guy's team.Quite fun even for a person not entirely captivated by the Warhammer universe or even the classic version of BB.Teams are mostly balanced, with some being faster, others being stronger etc.Solid gameplay considering that there's a plethora of races to choose and start and yes sometimes the game does seem unbalanced.Campaign is fun, good story, funnier commentary by Jim Johnson the Vampire and Bob Bifford the Ogre!Multiplayer is even funnier! Although losing a player to a block or even a slip (going for it) sucks and sometimes you have another player that accumulates so many injuries that you HAVE to fire him.Still! Game is pretty good even with the downside of having paid DLC and *cough* the pay to play teams have some extra stuff. In the end it does feel balanced!In the end it is fun!In the end you do get to kill and score!8/10!!			"

												I would deffinetly recommend this game but you need to keep in mind that you will rage sometimes with the RNG but it wil alsol sometimes help you, so it balances itself. You can always win, yet you cant ever be sure of victory. It's a lot of fun to learn new stategies and get visibly better. It's a little hard to start as it is the 2nd installment and it previously was (and still is) a board game so it has a lot of veteran players. You need to have patience at the beggining when you get destroyed. You need to calmly learn the game and be statisfied  with managing to make good plays, than forcing a draw and MAYBE, later on getting a win. I haven't played a lot of it yet but i can recommend it to someone who wants to learn a new and difficult game. In addition I find the community to be really great, every game that a I get a visibly better opponent and they notice my mistakes (as they also know im a new player from my Coach Level), they try to give me advice and are friendly. It's a big plus as the games may last quite long.			"

												 I understand why so many people are upset due to the content/price ratio however cyanide is in the process of reconciling this, they have just announcied 4 additional free races to those who have already purchased the game. That is now 6 races added to the game with no additional cost to those who currently own the game. I believe that is a step in the right direction, they have shown they are not going to milk those who have bought the game with DLCs and it makes business sense as im sure they'd rather sell more copies than dish out 10$ DLCs to a small/medium size player base.With that said I have sunk a lot of time into this game so far and ive loved every second of it (well when the dice are in my favor). Blood bowl is a game of strategy, luck, character devlopment, and tears as you fall out of nuffle's favor. Some new players, inclusing myself when first picking up the game, may feel there is to much luck involved, but I promise you if you take the time to really delve into this game, read the strategies that vary for each race, learn how to devlop your team to play the game you want them to, you will find that the RNG adds to the exciment and fun of the game rather than limits it. If the prospect of a well thought out fantasy sports game interests you and you are the type of person that loves games with depth that require some work on your end to learn, you will get as many hours and more out of this game as I did.Now, in terms as to wether or not it is worth purchasing over BB1 is a personal choice. With a time tested game such as blood bowl that has been around since before I was born, I feel the only room for improvment is in polish. That is why I bought this game, that is why I play it over BB1. There is more content in BB1 at the moment in terms of races however that will not always be the case and the way things are trending you may be missing out on free content if you decide to purchase later.If you are conservative with your money and already own blood bowl 1, you might want to pass on this game for the time being untill more races are released. If you are a blood bowl 1 owner on the fence, now may be the time to purchase in order to gain access to the new races for free as well as enjoy a fresh take on the game you already love. If you are looking to buy a new game to sink a lot of time into and get lots of enjoyment out of, I cant reccomend this game enough.			"

												FOR THOSE THAT KNOW BLOODBOWL:Better graphics than the previous version, much better interface.The tension when it slows down adn plays an animation when your armour gets broken is a really nice touch, since really gets you going ""Dont die, dont die, dont die etc...""Can normally get a game fairly quickly (less than 20 seconds) on the largest multiplayer) but the longer it takes the more chance the tema you face is either way stronger or weaker...I like the couple of rule changes for humans, was definitly needed.AI is much better, but still does not do 1 free move event, or act differently when its the 7-8th or 15-16th turn.FOR THOSE THAT DONT KNOW BLOODBOWL:Chess with randomness... Fun but very brutal. On a bad day even the best player can still lose...So dont take it too serious, and it is a very fun game.And now getting the 4 additional races free, shows that the devs are really doing the right thing.I hope they release items in the store that can make you characters look more unique.

												In case you don't know Bloodbowl is an infurating game originally originally on a board with tin soldiers as peices. It's infuriating because everything requires rolling dice and a 1 is always a fail and a 6 is always success... you'll be surprised by how many 1's you roll! And (quite often really) they will come up while you are doing something important... and salt will flow.When this came out I would have recommended it to new players anyway, but since the last patch I would say this game vastly trumps BB1 by cyanide. The only remaining niggles are minor and hopefully being fixed, with the up coming 4 new races being given to anyone who buys before they come out, now seems like a good time to get this game.It's not a totally faithful copy of the last set of rules and there are still some things they say they will add, but if you want that there's a free java client called fumbble that has a perfect copy of the rules. If you want to have fun and enjoy a good looking version of bb. this is it.			"

												There has been a ton of discussion over whether this game is a step forward or a step back for the series, and I have come to the conclusion that it is actually a step forward. The graphical updates are much appreciated and after some support post-launch I think the game in general is the best way to play Blood Bowl in video game form. It's super fun and value for moeny for sure given how long each game is. The races included are pretty core, and generally, I don't find myself MASSIVELY missing any races from Chaos Edition for the most part. Furthermore, with the announcement of 4 new races, most of which are pretty interesting, and all of which are going to be free on PC, and the current DLC, both of which are good value on sale, the race pool is going to be pretty decent by the end of next year, with my only big miss being Amazon. Overall, if you want to play Bloodbowl, I think this is the new standard edition for PC. Chaos Edition still has it's advantages, but I personally would play this version for sure.			"

												If you've got a few mates and think youâd enjoy some friendly banter over a fun, sports-strategy game then Blood Bowl 2 is fantastic. Itâs a pretty accurate digital version of the great board game launch way back when and if you learn to laugh at your misfortune and youâll enjoy it even more (the game has a habit of seeming to deliberately undo your best laid plans with unlucky dice rolls, lol).The campaign is simple, but a good intro to the mechanics of the game. Treat it as an extended tutorial rather than the main feature of the game. The AI customisable single-player leagues are decent, but the AI isnât sophisticated enough to try those desperate plays in the late stages of the game, and thus becomes a bit predictable. The multiplayer is where the real fun is to be had. There are a bunch of leagues you can enter and the community is normally made up of decent people (as with any game youâll find the sore losers and those that just constantly complain about their âbadâ luckâ¦ but for the most part people are friendly). If you can get enough mates together then private leagues offer endless enjoyment (and bragging rights)			"

												Bloodbowl's gameplay could be described as a Turnbased, RPG lite with elements from both American Football and Chess. Or as one of the most FRUSTRATING game ever... Until you actually figure out how to play. And this is where I think most people are at when it comes to Bloodbowl. They get a couple of Double skulls, and from there decide that the game is bull****. And than there are those who would argue that Bloodbowl 2 is not as good as previous Video Game versions. Which in all honesty is accurate. This game is indeed lacking in MANY options that previous games had including extra Online League Options, Singleplayer Campaigns, Races and various Thematic elements such as Racial specific Cheerleaders, differences in armor for higher level players, etc. However, the reason I am recommending this game is because dispite all of the downsides, it has one very big upside. Graphics.Now I know many are already thinking ""Graphics don't make games good! Gameplay does!"" And while that is most certainly true in many cases, it's a bit like saying that you shouldn't buy a new better looking version of Chess because it's no different.  The Gameplay of Chess is NEVER going to change, so in essence if you have the choice between a videogame adaptation that looks like crap vs one that doesn't, which are you going to get? Now I am in NO way disregarding the fact that the content of this game is not all that great in comparison to older Bloodbowl games, Especially in the Singleplayer experience. What I am saying is that the better graphics do make it a more enjoyable game overall. Now if you are someone who is interested in getting into Bloodbowl in general this is a very good jumping off point. The UI is clean, very few bugs, and the Graphics are pleasing to the eyes. Bloodbowl is an amazingly fun Risk Management game and Bloodbowl 2 is a great adaption of it. But keep in mind that buying this game for it's Singleplayer experience is a bad idea. But if you're like me who got it to play with/against friends and Random internet people it is most certainly worth it.			"

												Bloodbowl has always a game about minimizing your unlucky rolls by prioritizing your moves. If you learn that, you learn how to play the game. I actually play a lot more of the boardgame than the videogame, though			"

												This is my first time ever reviewing a game. Like previous posters have stated the dice rolls are completly in favor to the AI in the game.  So bad to a point I could almost tell what my dice rolls were going to be.  I understand the dev control difficulty level in this game by controlling the dice rolls, but my gosh this is bad.  Be prepared to rage quit many many times while playing this game.			"

												I've never played any previous Blood Bowl game, which means i might not be the guy you should listen to. But this game is really nice. The graphics look good, the UI is nice, animations beautiful and gameplay really addictive ( Unless you have constantly bad dicerolls ). Overall a great experience. My only significant complaints are that the race dlc are slightly overpriced, but since the developers are planning to release 4 other races for free ( if you own the game prior to their release ) it's not that much of a big deal. Another problem would be that if you buy this game, you're probably gonna buy it for the multiplayer, since the singleplayer isn't really fleshed out and the AI is not even competent most of the times.

												A game that is based around dice rolls, you may end up playing out a plan perfectly or the dice could say no and kill your favorite player. It's great fun when it goes your way but it punishes you so badly when it doesn't. Though the bad makes you value the good more. If you don't mind games based on dice rolls give it a try. I'm not a sports fan in the slightest, I don't keep up with any or even watch any but this game managed to keep my attention and I've enjoyed so much of it.			"

												I was a bit skeptical at first to recommend this game since it released with some issues, and those issues were not being fixed by the devs. But now they seem to have injected some kind of drug making them work super fast in order to make this a very enjoyable experience. Some might say that Blood bowl Chaos edition is way better because it has more races and such, but i find this to be more enjoyable since Chaos-editions UI was absolute garbage to be honest. This is like when films went from black and white to colors, sure the films itself might not have gotten better but its much more enjoyable with colors in my opinion.Keep in mind this game is not for everybody. It is in the sports genre, but it is wayyyy more tactictal than what you might expect.The cult following this game has is deserved, doesnt matter if you play chaos edition or this you just cant deny that Blood bowl is a good game.

Easy enough to pick up and there is a lot of depth to learn and master. There's nothing better than a solid game of blood bowl 2. Epic wins are fun and tragic losses suck but all in all it is a part of the game. There is just a degree of long term strategy that comes with the luck. I feel like I am coaching my team and i love leveling players up in different ways. Building them up for the long term and prepping for the future plays. Leagues where you know who you're playing seem super fun. 8/10 can't wait for new races!			"

												Bloodbowl is a great game but let's face it, the graphics in the 2009 version were awful, even by 2009 standards. This has been greatly improved, and the UI has been slightly improved. Does that justify the high price it goes for (as much as 45 euros in some places) for a game that is otherwise lacking many of the teams present in the excellent Chaos edition?I don't think it does. 30 euros seems a fairer price for the amount of content we have. Yet if it retails for less in your part of the world, or you see it on a promotion i do recommend it. Like the board game it is based on, it is an excellent game which is tactically rich and equally rewarding and frustrating at times. It uniquely combines the tactical challenge of a sport, with that of a battle.			"

Not in the shape that Blood Bowl players of decades know as Blood Bowl.Cyanide has made their own little uneccesary changes, because they know better than the rest of us. Thus creating a Blood Bowl that is gorgeous to look at, but it's not the Blood Bowl most players recognize.Not only have they done this, but they've done this without ever ONCE trying to explain WHY they do these things. Nor do they offer the ordinary fan an option to play with the standard rules of the game. So.. I regret having given my money to Cyanide for this 'almost but not quite BB' game.			"

												I do not recommend this game at all in its current condition.  Where to start... Firstly the game is missing 14 teams compared to blood bowl chaos edition. 14 teams!  That is more than half.  There are multiple bugs.  The developers have no idea what giving updates to the blood bowl community is, they are pretty much radio silent always!  MatchMaking is unbalanced and the only teams you come across are Dwarf, Chaos and Orc (all Bashy teams).  They is a campaign but nothing compared to blood bowl chaos edition where you got to manage a team from the start and progress them through many competitions till you finally got to the blood bowl!There are alot of minor issues that dont effect the gameplay but are still noticeable... like the fact i cant rotate the camera all he way around the pitch or that the only races that watch blood bowl are human peasants who all bought there outfit from the same store, and orcs who like to beat the life out of that drum!Until alot more content is added, being different teams, a proper campaign, more league options and bug fixes then i would avoid.The only improvement is the way the game looks.

												I love this game. It will take time to get all the teams out, but this was true of the previous version as well. The graphics are great and contrary to a lot of other complaints, I actually like the new interface. This is not a game for a passing user however, as being competitive online requires a fairly deep understanding of your teams strengths and the opponents weaknesses. The strategy involved in building a winning team can be quite complex, and in the end, as a (digital) dice based game, you will have the occasional run of bad luck where nothing goes right! If you like fantasy, and you like football, then this is the game for you!			"

												TL:DR - Compares poorly against Chaos edition of BB1Pros- It looks better than the older version- Online play is alittle bit more stable now compared to the launch of the gameCons- Lack of teams that are slowly being filled with paid DLC- Single player mode is hollow and pointless compared to BB1. This is the biggest miss.- The UI  is buggy and poorly thought out - Sometimes your player will randomly throw the ball, sometimes it won't register clicks and other times it will do random things in game. It's incredibly frustating in a game with a small margin for error.- The animations getting a bit dull after a while- A few random crashesI was hoping after coming back to this again after a few months they'd have fixed the problems, but after playing one game I've noted they certainly haven't.... Would only be worth it on a very good sale (or when the chaos edition equivalent comes out with all the teams included)			"

												So the vector between football fans and fans of fantasy RPG is not very big.  If you like sports and D&D both, this is probably for you.  If you hate either of those things then you'll probably want to pass.  It is difficult, it is a lil repetative (like every sports game am I right).  It is also hilarious and addictive!  Sersiously, the announcers during the campaign are great.  Would I pay full price?  I don't know, probably.  If you see this on sale during summer sale or whatever, it's worth it.			"

However as much as i like to play this game its based on an online community which is difficult to join. It has no lobby to chat to organise games which is so important for this game, even on the ps4 the community opened its own chat room to organize games. They have in effect ruined their own game by removing this function their previous game had. To add to this i often find myself waiting for 10 mins plus for a game only to find myself giving up looking!			"

												I do not recommend it, because it is less polished than the Chaos Edition and it is much more expensive and a little bit Pay to Win because the best races has to be bought per DLC. The leage system is less adjustable, for example if you do not want to have player aging you have to play online against real people because it is only then able to turn off. It has although to make an additional account which has to be online. If you just want to play online buy it at sale if offline buy better chaos edition.			"

I have finished the last match of the campaign 4 times now, and every time it crashed during a cut scene. Sometimes the game just becomes so slow it is unusable - only restarting the game solves this. Saving games is hit and miss, sometimes it works, some times you have to start again. And sometimes it randomly crashes. This is with recent game and video drivers, and on supported OS and hardware.I would recommend not getting the game now, but wait till they fix these problems.			"

												Hi Folks.To everyone new to the Blood Bowl Franchise: this is not meant to be a Single Player Game.All about the spirit and the fun comes from fighting other Players, its all about Strategy, Tactic and a bit of Luck some times. ( Its a Dice Game after all)But first things first - Is BB2 better than BB1?Kind of, yes. BB2 has a much better look all over the place, the UI is more Userfriendly, the presentation of the stadiums and the teams is awesome, it plays smoother and is just more enjoyable than BB1.And there are so cool details they added, for example if you purchase a Bloodweiser Stand for your Stadium, the crowd is much more pushed and the sound effects of your fans cheering changes aswell, more singing and Vuvuselas all over the place, nice!The graphics are great, with cool beating animations and close up cameras if something important happens, really cool and it delivers a nice feeling of being close to the Action.So the Game itself, the Programming and Graphics are much better than BB1.The most common reason for negative reviews is the lack of Content it has at the Moment.And that in fact is true, BB1 has much more Content to deliver, but you need to consider that BB1 already has 2 Addons, and compared to the Base Game the Content is the same.A few not gamebreaking but important things missing aswell, and hopfully will be added soon.The Game lacks in case of Informations, for example no Hall of Fame for your Team, no Player Statistics, no information about Opposing Team pre Match, no Visual change of high lvl Players and so on.In my opinion it seems they just where running out of time to implement all those things before release, and im very confident that they will add that kind of things the next few Months.Additional Teams will be delivered saperatly as a DLC for 6,99$ each as far is i know, what is a fair price because the teams are really looking awesome.So for everybody new to Bloodbowl, BB2 is the better choice. Because it has a better UI and a Singleplayer Campaign wich is in fact a large Tutorial.To the Bloodbowl Veterans out there, you want to buy and play Bloodbowl 2 for the same reasons, you played BB1 instead of Fumble. If you want all the Content the BB Lore will offer and all the Statistics and information Possible, play Fumble, its free after all.But if you want a nice looking Bloodbowl expirience that entertains you, just give BB2 a Chance.

												This game is being left for dead, back to the old ways again. I really, really want to LOVE this game.. and I think that goes for everyone else who's a long time BB fan. But it seems the developers/publishers are doing the best they can to make us all disappointed. It could be so damn great, but alas, always coming up very short. Bucket list:- No armour upgrades (building your team is a big deal, you want to love your team!)- Some player animations look re-used from BB1- All teams should have their own stadiums. - No hall of fame screen for past or dead players - they just retire and never be seen again- Team UI screens is horrible, lacking stats, looks thrown together by a developer.- Cheerleaders are the same for everyone- Lacking in team logos/team colors (why canât we pick some colors, add a logo perhaps, more customization)- Blood bowl is all about customization.. add as much of this as possible! silly hats, extra weapons, team colors/home ground advantages..- Does not feel like a complete game without goblins and halflings.- Adding pitch hazards to your games like the broken helicopter in the campaign- devâs excuses are not great, I think that after 2+ years of development this game would be so much further down the line.If another developer had made this game, I would imagine that at launch the customization for teams and players would be huge. Almost too much!You want to own the team and make it yours, not just another chaos team with black color like everyone else..			"

												As a new player, I found Blood Bowl 2 both unforgiving and exciting to play. But beware, it is a game that gives a lot of teeth cringing moments and this is why it is so satisfying when luck (also known as Nuffle's grace) is on your side.			"

												It is a digital version of Blood Bowl tabletop game and does a good job at that. It is frequently on sale and the extra teams are optional. The playerbase is small but dedicated and you never have to wait too long for a match. The game is easy to recommend if you are at all interested in Blood Bowl.			"

												Alot of people complaining about the lack of teams and yeah while I agree they shoulda made Lizardmen and Wood Elves into the game for free instead of being a preorder bonus I still say the game is just fine, though I do understand the frustration about its early release issues. I honestly think that thats mostly because it was pitched at consoles (mostly PS4) and that made PC optimization suffer which unfortunately is their main market but you can't blame them for pitching it to a popular demographic as the PS4 is known to be the system in which people tend to pick up sports games, but I digress, after the newest patch I wholly recommend this game.

												I preordered this before it's release, and somehow never got around to installing it until recently. Overall, I like it because, ya know, Blood Bowl...But...and I have a number of them, the game feels desperately unfinished after several months worth of patches. I would call it like so:Positive:* Gameplay basically works* Graphics are much improved (some clipping issues during takedowns, but generally goodNot-so-positive:*I've seen a couple crashes to desktop mid-gameJust plain sad:* Stadiums stands (any stadium, human of otherwise) packed to the rafters with the same human character model with just clothing variations* The ""joy"" of knowing that *every* touchdown will be met by a display of the dead-eyed Reikland Reavers cheerleaders, whether they're playing or not. *Lush green grass fields, every stadium. I mean c'mon...really? They couldn't even change the color mapping to make the grass look more sickly in the more ""icky"" stadiums like the Skaven's? No stone..no dirt...just PGA top 10 course greens...yecch...Like I said, overall I like the game, but the lack of taking care of the niceties, which really are important to an immersive fantasy environment really haul this release down a few pegs. I'd say 6/10, when 8 or 9/10 would be easily within reach if the details had been or were attended to.			"

												If there was a 'maybe' I'd pick that as my recommendation instead of 'yes'.	Personally, I love the game and always have from the days of playing it on a table top. But the criticism of it not being a total upgrade on Chaos Edition (the previous version) holds a lot of water.The game itself is tactical and very in-depth: player positioning, skill selection and risk- management are the main things youâll have to learn â usually by trial and error! Itâs not too hard to actually play; it is very hard to master though and will frustrate you if youâre new to the game. Hang on: it WILL frustrate you all of the time!Compared to BB1 thoughâ¦there are less races, players donât look different when they level (etc. etc.). In short there are shortcomings where there shouldnât be. However, the game no longer rewards disconnecting players (which I totally hated), it looks better in many (but not all) ways and it is definitely improving as the developers iron out issues with the game and add new teams and content. I have both versions, but donât play BB1 - mainly because itâs dying out and when a player is losing, or simply doesnât like the look your team, they have a habit of pulling the plug and voiding the game.  In short, itâs rewarding but not easy at all. "

												Blood Bowl is one of my favourite games ever, and I've spent plenty of hours playing it, both table-top in my youth and more recent video game versions. Plus points:+ it's Blood Bowl. If you don't know what that is, Blood Bowl is a hybrid turn-based sports-strategy game based in the Warhammer Fantasy world. The game itself has quite a steep learning curve, is heavily reliant on luck, and is quite unforgiving. Yet it's also hugely addictive. There's few feelings as satisfying as executing a carefully constructed game-plan, or pulling off the unlikliest string of dice-rolls to get you out of a jam. Success is never guaranteed, meaning even the best teams and players can lose. + the graphics are great. They're not normally a big deal for me, but the quality of them (compared with Chaos Edition especially) and the action-cam on knock-downs gives the game a much more intense feel than BB:CE often had. The character models are pretty great, though it would have been nice if they changed as players levelled up, as in BB:CE.+ some of the commentary is genuinely laugh-out-loud funny. To paraphrase one of my favourite examples: ""There's only two things I hate; racists, and ****ing High Elves!""+ the community is, on the whole, friendly and welcoming. I'm yet to run in to anyone on multiplayer who left me with a bad feeling, which is rare in games as focused on multiplayer as this. Just don't complain that dice rolls are fixed when you roll double-skulls, reroll, and hit double-skulls again. They're not fixed, Nuffle just doesn't like you.+ the AI teams are better when compared with BB:CE. Players have more realistic skill-sets, and they play a bit better than in BB:CE. Not by much, and it will never come close to a human opponent, but for someone who played a lot of single-player on BB:CE, the improvement is noticable, even if the AI still does do some dumb moves at times.Neutal:~ the campaign seems to take an age to get going, working as more an extended tutorial, and can ask for some very odd conditions for victory in matches.~ developing your own stadium and giving it special bonuses is a nice, but small touch.Negatives:- far fewer races at launch than in BB:CE. The lack of 'stunty' teams is especially disappointing (speaking as someone who loved the chaos goblins could inflict, even if they barely ever won a match). New teams are set for release as time goes by, with the devs giving them for free to people who already own the game, but it's the biggest negative about Blood Bowl 2. No Undead (at the time of writing) is a big miss, too.- some signs of laziness/rushing in a few areas - some dialogue doesn't fully match up with what's happening, character models are heavily repeated for the crowd, no race-specific cheerleaders. Small points ultimately, but it means the game lacks a bit of polish.I've found myself playing this over BB:CE since I brought it (even if it means I can't play as my beloved goblins). Which version you pick up depends on which teams you want to play against/as. But, assuming they keep adding teams, then I recommend Blood Bowl 2 over BB:CE. If I had to score it, I'd probably give it a 7/10.			"

												HiI usually don't write so many reviews; in this case I do though because I think many do injustice to the game: A lot of the bad critics are based on the dlc/pricing policy. That is one thing and does not necessarily display the quality of the game. Apart from looking better, BB2 also is lot more stable. I haven't discovered flaws like not being able to switch players during set up before kick-off (happened a lot for me in BB) or the AI just doing nothing. Sure, this AI could also be better, on the other hand, for average Joes like me, it increases the fun factor (by decreasing the frust factor). The campaign might be short, but it is quite entertaining. It definitely is much better in BB2 than in BB. Some others complain about lacking features like design of players and teams; well, as average Joe, this is neglectible. If you like football, violence (in games) & tactics, this IS a good game.			"

												Really fun little game inspired by modern day Rugby/American Football with an injection of fantasy. Two games are never quite the same thanks to the RNG brought by a system built on a d6 but it still manages to be quite fun to play, especially if you have a group of friends that get it like I have. We have our own little league and make our own schedules to play each other and all watch each game and have a blast at the hilarity that is Blood Bowl. Really stepped it up since release with the upcoming release of 4 new races (to be given free to anyone who owns the game before their release) and much needed QoL changes in-game. I only see this improving as the Devs listen to their community.As for my criticisms, the fault lies within the core aspects of the game itself. Blood Bowl at its heart seems to only support two styles of play: Smash or Pass. With teams like Chaos being built as their single purpose to destroy teams, it seems to go against the grain of ever needing to score. Why bother when you can just kill the enemy team? Which begs the question, why did any teams ever care about scoring when their lives are just at risk?			"

												Great game, great company which has supported the game through thick and thin. Cyanide has really stepped up and listened to the community for improvements and bug fixes and really improved the entire product.Wow, it's been a YEAR since Blood Bowl 2 came out, crazy heckin' year gamers! Yessiree bob, cyanide ran a blood bowl 2 world cup, games workshop is releasing a new boxed set. Almost all the first wave dlc teams are out (and were free to people who bought the game!).Now comes the cold hard facts: Blood Bowl is not an easy game to get into, but it is a fun strategic game. It kind of plays more like a puzzle game with lots of risk management. If you are going to hop into the game you'll definitely want to hunt down a copy of the ""Blood Bowl CRP"" or ""Blood Bowl LRB6"" since these pdfs have the entire rules which govern the game and inevitably you'll want to figure out what's going on.That said the ""campaign"" mode slowly eases you into the mechanics and will teach you little by litte. I quite enjoy this campaign, it does some cool set-piece stuff with the games, but if you're a blood bowl veteran the AI just isn't challenging at all.BUT! Cyanide has done much more than release DLC, yes! We've been fortunate to get piles and piles of free updates, tweaks and fixes. The UI has dramatically improved, including grids, skill summaries as optional display pieces, the player roster screen for editing teams was also improved. AND they added options to turn off subtitles, AND prevent the camera from jumping around during your opponent's turn, so now you can actually plan things!However, here's the cold turkey time, is this game worth the price tag? Well let me break down your options for playing blood bowl these days:1. You can go outside and meet a tabletop gaming club, buy miniatures and play in a local league making new friends and memories which will last a lifetime.2. Play fumbbl, a free web-based java client which has all of the teams and over 100 fan-made teams (which are only available in fan-leagues, so you can happily play with only official teams with no fuss)3. Play cyanide's Blood Bowl Chaos Edition4. Play cyanide's Blood Bowl 2.Now, previously, I mentioned that Blood Bowl 2 has more daily games than fumbbl, and this is still true, so if you want sheer number of players in your community then Blood Bowl 2 is the obvious choice.Yes Blood Bowl 1 has more single player content, but it's been so long since I've lost a game to the AI so I'll admit I don't really care for the single player content in either game. Sure the BB2 campaign is pretty entertaining with all the fancy set pieces (and you get to use STAR PLAYERS) but beyond that, eh, I'll take my multiplayer leagues any day thank you, and boy there are a fair few to decide between!I hope you do decide to pickup blood bowl, and if you're still on the fence I suggest you look up Cknoor's tutorials for learning the game as it will give you a good idea of whether you will enjoy the game or not.Here are Cknoor's tutorials if you are interested:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSJ6kwwJv4Nq12RPHARCNSpIJ7162MANHhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSJ6kwwJv4Nr-Ky1PaFZys50S7zewio1O(heck if you decide to get the game these are pretty top to check out)Cheers, hope to see you on the pitch.

												BB 2 is an addicting and fun game, all be it with some frustrating moment.  I like the rng and trying to beat it, I usually don't like the coaches who hate a match up and concede.  I hope that this changes with the new races and with some tweaks to players and skills.  8/10			"

												It's a solid and surprisingly deep game that doesn't take too long to play but allows you to think strategically each turn. The game devs havn't released all the various factions yet but have decided to release them for free for anyone who owns the game before those races are released. Very much worth getting into.			"

												Love this game. Was watching a lot of Youtube videos before I made the decision to buy it. DonÂ´t regret it one bit, itÂ´s a fantastic game and definately deserves better reviews imo. The gameplay is smooth and highly enjoyable, being an old Warhammer player I love seeing the different races represented on the field, the game itself is very tactical with random things thrown in where the dice can make or break your game. Sure, you can lose badly because of unlucky rolls, but thatÂ´s Blood Bowl and how it always has been. If you donÂ´t like that, then this is not a game for you. Myself, I love this game and highly recommend it. Very much looking forward to seeing more races trickle in. Good job, Cyanide.			"

												hmmmmmm... got some problems, seems to be re-accuring in the BB games and the reason i stopped playing the last game. just played a custom league against npc coaches, lotsa fun, some tough games in a knockout but then i get to the final, had 2 nights of great fun up to now.... i fail every role, my team gets knocked down every turn, i had 3 injurys by turn 2 and my best blitzer dead and 2 other players KO'd in the next turn, even after re-rolling the death it came up death, now if youve not played the BB table table game then this might seem resonable but if you have then you would know that in order to get a death twice in a row thats like 6 6's on a D6 in a row, oh and busting there armour twice, yes that can happen but in a game where i loose every role it seems weird. also i spent 3 turns atempting to pickup a ball, in fair weather , with an agi 4 player with safe hands and he shook the ball around like a tool before being flattened and the npc scoring. Now this used to happen all the time in BB1 because it was a cheap to make game and i was hoping that the difficulty level in BB2 would be defined by coach skill and player abilities not by the blatant and almost obvious dice swindling. several of my mates have flat refused to buy this game because they knew it would be this way.Dont really care about the price, the lack of teams, the medicore UI but really, this level of shoddy development is just poor.I really wish i could get my money back for this game and am currently trying. if this was your problem with the first game then DO NOT BUY THIS GAME			"

												Blood Bowl is a tactics game with calculated risks in mind, which if your considering buying this then you are doing the same with the risk being will you like it. A brief way of knowing if you would like this game is already knowing dice rolls you needed to work failing and losing you the game will happen. Then also you could be making the greatest rolls and feeling unstopable. THERE IS HOPE for experienced coaches due to the fact you start to learn which rolls to make and when to do them in your turn and how to safely use your team and still having maximum output. After you join a league the game gets better because each time you play you can be earning points to level up people and then you will have an awesome time trying to see how your murderbeast just took out his essential players.Then you will have tragic phases where your most experienced player that has played 30+ matches with 10 career touchdowns and those few game winning plays is killed by a block and you react with the most sorroful wimper because you used your apothacary to stop another player from getting a -1 in a stat. After this you have the option of scrapping the team or working with your new rookie that sucks compared to your team and having to make due to make someone else to be your star player.All in all its a fun game with some RNG in a new teams life that will lower as you get certain skills and learn how to play the game most effeiciently so I rate the game a solid 8/10, this is because i love the gameplay but you need to search and league and play with them or you have to spin in a public matchmaker the devs put up, then you will occasionally get mad when your rng is worse than that one guy in a movie that dies and he was one day from retirement because you had your players die 10 years from retirement and they were showing promise so now you have to go buy more.

												Great game, but be prepared for frustrating plays. Players of Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition, will probably miss a lot of the teams from there, as Blood Bowl 2 is very limited in the number of teams. I do however believe it's a major improvement in the UI compared to BB1. All in all, I recommend it if you like turn based strategy games with ""minor"" dice impact.

												The majority of the negative reviews seem to be due to this game featuring less playable races than the first Blood Bowl but apart from that this is a really enjoyable game with great presentation and the dice roll based gameplay keeps you on edge and makes the touchdowns feel so satisfying. I've seen people complain about the dice rolls being too random but all you have to do is position your team members so they can assist eachother with blocks.Nothing beats creating a team of alcoholic dwarves with majestic beards and smushing some annoying elves.Definitely worth it if you like turn based strategy games.

 This key was obtained from evolve.pr for purposes of review  Summary: Blood Bowl 2 is an odd one. There's definitely a bunch of fun to be had with friends here: from a pure strategy level, the game does bring the challenge in several ways in a back and forth chess match. The game has definitely been improved from the original, as the UI implementation has made a lot of necessary changes to make the game more accessible to the average gamer. But the game's core design has a couple of things that will cause massive frustration for players, as a lack of customization in leagues, options that seem to be missing, and the dreaded RNG element of the game will drag the game down while it's attempting to take off. This game hits a niche for strategy elements that's for sure, and sadly, I can recommend it as a sale title for the general public, but a good title to have for strategy enthusiasts who like the subject matter, and people who are willing to take a hit or two while playing through the game's randomization element.  Gameplay Footage and Video Review: 


YouTubeâ¢ Video: Blood Bowl 2 (Review): The Steel Curtain....Literally.Â 

			Views: 297		

			This was done with a key obtained from evolve.pr. After 17 hours of bone crushing tackles and long periods of cursing, I'm finally ready to give my final review of the Cyanide Studios Tabletop...		

 Lists: +: On a pure strategy level, the game works in a chess like manner very, very well. Two coaches going at it on an intellectual level will really turn it into a battle of wits. The game feels a bit balanced in terms of overall aggressive/defensive gameplay, and that several strategies will be viable. UI vastly improved from Blood Bowl 1. Lot easier to see what's going on and what your options are. A lot easier to see exactly what is going on then in the previous game.  Different classes play reasonably and give you a reason to try them all to see what works for you. While races may play similarly, you can really get deep into the customization of your team through varies of ways in player progression.  Punishes for staying in the endzone and sidelines, good design in making them punishing places to be.  Skill system can take away the RNG element a bit and really adds a level of depth to the game. Campaign eases you into the mechanics of the game, and despite some confusion caused because of the changing concepts, it did the job reasonably well.  The announcers stand out, especially in the campaign mode. Good situational humor and the two voice actors do a fantastic job of bringing them to life. Character models look good, especially with mutation system to make characters stand out on the field. -: The game's RNG is brutal, to the point where those who dislike random elements in games will find themselves screaming at the dice. Percentages may be misleading, as in real play it seems like there's differences from what is listed.  Lack of customization for rules in leagues, and the ability to tweak matches so that both sides play a game that they'd prefer over the basic rule set. Really need to emphasize this: this could have gone a long way to taking away the grievances that I had.  Lack of options. Games can feel really really slow, and really wanted a way to speed them up. While I appreciate a couple of the camera/UI options added, overall the game feels bare on the PC options as a whole. Progression system really feels like a grind at times. To make your team the way you want, expect to grind a bit, and even more when they eventually die or retire. Sometimes it isn't clear why a skill didn't work, even though at the bottom of the screen, you can see why.  Audio Lines get repetitive over time, it needed more variety here to take advantage of the improved presentation and great voice acting.  Clipping issues unfortunately pop up several times in close ups, and can make the technical precision of the game stand out in a bad way. Under the hood (when slowed down or stuttering), you can see some corners cut on animation.  Wished mouse input when using windowed mode did not register clicks outside the context of the  window.  A couple of graphical bugs would show up from time to time. "

												I played the Blood Bowl board game a long time ago with my friends, and we had a lot of fun.Because of that I later bought and played Chaos League from Cyanide and enjoyed it. The A.I. was really bad but in multiplayer matches the game was a blast. You could switch between RTS and TBS, and the commentators where funny and a novelty for me.When BB2 came out, a friend besieged me to get it and play with him.In the end he gifted me this game when it was on sale. Before that I mostly bought and played videogames in stores or online on GOG and so I had to reactivate my steam account, which was 5 years dormant (I initally wanted to play Dark Messiah in multiplayer back then).I downloaded steam and reluctantly had to accept the terrible eula and allow intrusive data collection to be able to play BB2 in multiplayer.The Blood Bowl Board Game is good. Maybe be the best and most fun system GW ever brought out, and luckily they abandoned it for a time so there is a great GW-independent community which kept the board game alive and some of them played the digital blood bowl 1 and jumped on blood bowl 2 when it came out.The BB2 videogame however is not that great. The Sound is good and the commentators, one of the trademarks of cyanide sports games I suppose, are ok(they soon become a little repetitive). Music is pretty much forgetable on the rare occasions it comes into play. The graphics are, compared to modern standards, mediocre at best. The 3D models in your team have variable heads but for some races not enough to avoid clones in your team. Speaking of clones, it seems the spectators in the stadium all come from the clone-factory on Kamino, ... recently I spotted some ork drummers in the audience, which could mean we arrived at two models? Yeah? Same with the cheerleaders...why? Animations are a bit clunky and there are a few glitches when models interact.The game-menus where you manage your teams and play in leagues are just awful and counter-intuitive.I would think, since the rules pre-existed, the developers only had to adopt those without the need to create a game concept from zero and could focus on the polish.They failed in most part imo. The programming is worse than in all low-budget indie-games I encountered. The dynamic camera gets stuck very often in animation scenes (if you havnÂ´t turned them off) so the game continues elswhere without you seeing what is happening. The randomization routines feel off the charts, and seem inplausible after (superfical) testing. There is a single-player campaign, meant perhaps as a tutorial(?), which is grotesquely awful in all aspects: bad tutorial, bad storytelling, no fun.Another negative aspect of the game: From the time of purchase you get all supsequent released races, but pre-Release they cut the playable races down to eight, to sell the single races later for 6.99â¬ if you donÂ´t buy the game early (for 45â¬ without discounts).The undelying game mecanics are good as is the community for the most part (both no achievements from cyanide).The execution of the game is sloppy if you phrase it mildly, a piece of stinking s*** if you phrase it harshly.Since further support of cyanides BB1 will be abandoned there are not that many alternatives if you want to play blood bowl in online matches, though I suppose you could build a online 2D board, adapt the rules and cnace dice better than cyanide and play with icons and the numbers and have fun, or you could pick up the board game with your local community, though GW threatens to reprint BB which could mean no offical tournaments outside of GW-Shops anymore and no custom-miniatures in your team which are not from the overpriced GW-catalogue *sigh*.If you are a die-hard blood bowl fan you probably already own this game if you are interested in getting into it, I cannot recommend to buy it at its full price. Considering the overall quality of the product with all the effort the developers did not put into the game 44,99â¬ for the core game and 6.99â¬ for an additional race you want to play is rediculous.If you cannot relinquish, wait for a sale <15â¬ or let your hardcore blood-bowl-fan friend gift it to you.Edit 29.12.2016 (After playing some more): So, I continued playing since I signed on to a german league, and ... I had fun most of the time. But... there is still so much to improve and the possibility that the review will become a positive one. Why not yet? Aside from the still existing clone armys in many teams (My 7 dwarf lineman have only 5 different heads to choose from), in the spectators (every one has the same head) and the cheerleaders (only one human model, always blue) there are still many bugs some a nuisance and some really game breaking. The zoom out after many actions does not work properly so the game continues whithout you seeing it because the camera is pinned to a tiny spot on the field. The worst thing happening was accidentally signing off instead off quiting the game after playing and not remembering your password. There is a password retrival button but nothing happens after confirming my e-mail. nothing send, not even in the spam. Why isnt there an automated function implemented? In the forums many other players expierienced this. The support at focus-home did answer my direct email, requesting to give them a new password. Now IÂ´m waiting that it will be set.I will continue following the game and it might still be possible that coming improvments will tipp the balance to an all around positive expierience.			"

												I bought this game not knowing what to expect, I enjoy turn based games, I enjoy warhammer (fantasy and 40K), but I do not enjoy american football. Even with the most basic knowledge of football, the atmosphere of the game shines and leaves me satisfied. I may be the only one, but I enjoyed the campaign, it has humor, betrayal, drama, and crazy out-there moments that you would expect from the warhammer universe with surprisingly well done voice acting by Jim and Bob (the announcers). The multiplayer is really the bread and butter of the game though, with an in-depth league system (still waiting on individual player stats) I felt for my players and did my best to keep them alive and well because death is permanent, even in online play.P.S. There was a flurry of launch issues like compatibility and graphical glitches which the devs speedily remedied by putting out a comprehensive list of fixes for on the forums. kudos for being on the ball at game release.

												Same deal as the first version of Blood Bowl 1, missing a bunch of features but still a fun game.Tl;dr Do not buy it >>>YET<<< unless you're a diehard bloodbowl fan. It is completely unfinished and as buggy as the first iteration of Blood Bowl PC, and is a straight downgrade from chaos edition in a lot of ways aside from # of teams. That being said, it will almost certainly be improved a lot in the long-run, just as Blood Bowl 1 was, so if you don't buy it now get it after a few patches for sure, in a sale. It's just a shame they seem to have not learnt much from BB1.The Bad:- The league system has been downgraded heavily in choice of options for organizers in almost every way possible, there's no excuse for â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ on the only thing that keeps people playing your game.- Very buggy/some mechanics and skills just flat out do not function as intended (almost as bad as the first game).- No grid still- Hella expensive- 8 teams and it's hella expensive for 8 teams, they're also very vanilla teams, none of the fun/abnormal ones.- No aesthetic change on player level up anymore- Chance of some dodgy things with Cyans (their in-game currency)- Wave goodbye to cool and varied pitches.- Game is literally unfinished, still no team specific cheerleaders, only two models in the crowd etc. - Can't view opponents team during inducements anymore.- Mouse click functions are reversed from the first game. Maddening.The Good- Good quality spectating, probably the absolute biggest upgrade.- Bob and Jim are back, kinda.- More new player/idiot friendly. It displays the end % chances for actions as well as the dice.- It is prettier.- The proposed DLC model for teams is better than expansions and offers far better choice (imo).- Better UI (I hesitate to put this here, since the UI is def better in design, but they removed so many features from it to simplify it).- Dark Elves look ridiculously more fruity.- It's still Bloodbowl, and there's no substitute bug yet.- Possiblity of some neat things with Cyans.- You can access the options mid-match- Lots of small quality of life changes.- Praise the sun memes.

												For someone unfamailair with the franchise; it's a turnbased, tactical, quasi-football simulation with rpg and progression mechanics using the warhammer universe.  Kind of a mouthful right?  It works suprisingly well though.This game is almost less of a sequal than a graphics and UI overhaul of the first game.  The game itself is functionally identical in terms of gameplay, but all the peripheral portions have been improved.  The UI is now easy to use and mostly intuitive (if you assume that should just be a given, play the first game and weep).  The graphics are not just functional as they were in the original, but actually quite good with cutscenes showing the action and giving a visceral thrill when your minotaur curb stomps a dwarf.  Full game pad support.  The team manager has more depth and it's now easy to almost instantly create custom leagues to play in.  You also now have the ability to trade your players online to other people which is just an interesting feature. One of the largest improvements is the addition of an actual tutorial in the form of the campaign.  It's a little slow but actually tells you what does what as opposed to the original blood bowls method of, ""Just click around and hope for the best.""  The campaigns narrative is also charmingly silly which is a plus.Given the longevity of the previous game the community is going to be extremely active for some time as well, so that's another bonus.Now this is not a game for everyone.  Like any authentic adaptation of a games workshop title, die rolls are king and you will inevitably end up cursing at your screen as what should have been a sure thing somehow turns into disaster.  If you've never called the RNG a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cheater, then you haven't actually played a games workshop title.  With that said though, the opposite can occasionally happen too, and it feels amazing. The only real downside is that the previous incarnation of blood bowl had 23 races, this has 8 (and doesn't have the undead, which was my favorite you â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s!)  The difference will be made up in DLC's which, depending on your preference is either fine or, to use the the langauge of the forum screamers, a bloodsucking scam that even EA would be ashamed of.  Personally I'm ok with it, and would rather have the game right now to play than wait however long it would be to get all the other races out simultaneously, but it nevertheless IS a negative.  This is a Null issue to new comers to the game but blood bowl 1 vets will probably feel like thier choices have been severely cut back.On the whole it's a pretty game that is silly fun and a lot more welcoming to new players than the first.  Buy it, Play it, cripple a scaven and laugh.  It's good times.  8/10			"

												Blood Bowl 2 is amazing turn-based strategy inspired by the board game - Blood Bowl with Warhammer figures.First of all, I am not any kind of a rugby fan. I don't know rugby rules much as well, but this game somehow caught me and I enjoy it a lot. Secondly, you might not be sure about purchasing this game because of many negative reviews/recommendations.. I think it is mainly because when the game was launched, there were many bugs and people were often disconnected from their multiplayer games. There were also fewer playable races than in Blood Bowl (1), so some people could be mad about this. (there are still fewer races than in BB1, but more playable races will be added in future patches)However, BB2 today (2016) is much better than it was before. And also better than BB1. Mechanics are clear, turns allow you to manage your strategy properly and the UI is satisfying as well. There is a campaign that new players will appreciate a lot since it serves as a tutorial and you will learn there a lot. Then you can practise against good BOTs or join one of many multiplayer leagues and improve you and your team with every game there.I highly recommend this game. If you like board games, you should consider buying it. If you also like Warhammer, grab this game now!			"

												Prelude: If this sin't on sale, hold off on buying, as there is a GOTY style edition coming later this summer. You'll end up costing yourself more in the long run. If it is on sale, or money is no object to you, read on.Ok first off let's get this out of the way. This is a board game. A board game with dice. If you are the type of person who can't handle when dice decide that today is bad times day, walk away. Go spend your money on soemthing else. Allright, everyone else still here? Good.Blood Bowl is a near 1:1 conversion of the GW boardgame of the same name, where the races of the Warhammer Fantasy (Rip in peace) universe have put aside their differences and stopped their endless war sand violence, to instead travel to each other's realms, throw riots that resemble wars, and play games with a ton of violence. Hey, baby steps.The game itself is a turn based affair where your teams take turns moving, punching each other, and trying to advance the squiggskin to the other teams endzone. One of the most critical components of this is the concept of the Turnover. Certain actions, if you screw them up, end your turn immediatly. This turns the strategy of the individual matches from merely trying to roll the best dice, to activly trying to make your opponent have to roll hard dice. Thus positioning is king, and while sometimes the RNG, affectionatly known as ""Nuffle"" (after the game's patron god), decides nothing will go right, most of the time the better coach/team wins out.Individual matches provide gold and experience to your team, which results in teams getting ever more powerful as they age, eventually reaching a high level, where they tend to eventually face some sort of calamity and get knocked back down. Some players hate this and throw their team out once it reaches that point, but others decide that rebuilding is part of the experience.For Multiplayer, there are two open groups that players use. The first is the Open Ladder, which is a lawless land where you will often find people who conceede early, although toxic players can still be reported. The other is the 3-4 month long Champions Ladder, where new teams must be created every season, and conceeding is strictly forbidden (5 conceedes on your account and you're out for the season). After the season is over, the best coach of each race goes into a tournament, while the rest can either start their teams anew or move their teams into the Open Ladder.On the more orginized side, there is no shortage of scheduled leagues with their own rules, communities, and meta to choose from, and are always looking for new memebers. Most can be found either on BBtactics, the official Blood Bowl forums, or on the /r/bloodbowl subreddit, among many other sites.All in all, Blood Bowl is worth a purchase, as long as you are buying it for MP. The AI is complete garbage so if you have no intention to playing online, don't bother.			"

												A wonderful mix of football and violence in a turn based strategic setting. If you liked the tabletop original, this game is for you! League, ladder and cup competition play with players that attain more skills the more matches they survive! Great fun and frustration to be had as you balance your chances with the dice.			"

												BB2 is a fantastic and faithful implementation of the board game. I liked blood bowl the board game. It's nice to a have a computer version to play. I can see why there are mixed reviews for this game, as the guide has serious shortcomings and does not describe the mechanics of the game very well. It would be better for a new player to read the LRB6 which would make the game play more clear. There are other small annoyances, like not being able to save your game when playing against the computer. You either finish the game or cancel the game. There are no rewards for winning a league ro a cup, not some kind of celebratory cut scene, or trophy, or anything. You just start the next season. But I find this version more friendly and entertaining than blood bowl chaos edition. The computer AI is poor. I've played 40+ games and have only lost once. I disagree with all the comments about the computer cheating with dice rolls. I haven't seen anything that would suggest that. Perhaps it is a LTP issue. In any case, I recommend this game, but only if you can get it on sale.			"

												I personally have mixed feelings about this game, but that entirely depends on the rng in place.

												I got this game on sale. I would say its a combination of Warcraft, American Football and chess with a shot of gambling thrown in. I'm working through the last missions of the campaign and while I dont know if I'll play beyond that I must say that while granted I got in on sell the game has delivered and I am pleased with my purchase. This game is alote to take in but the campaign does a good job of easing you into it. As someone who has never ever played a turn based RL board game before this was a really fun new experience. The retail price of 45 is large amount of casht to put down but if you can get it on sale during the holidays I would recommend it. You will get your 16 hours of the campaign alone easily, anything after that is gravy. "

												First of all, Blood Bowl is an awesome Strategy game.I dont like American Football, so i never intended to play this game.However it was recommended by friends so many times that I finally tried it and endured the tutorial games.Although they still suck, they do explain the game mechanic pretty well.After most mechanics are introduced you actually play this game and understand it.Thats when this game becomes a blast. I mean mind blowing strategic fun. A timer putting pressure on your moves.So many decisions to be made in such short time. I have one thing that bugs me about the campaign. I do not progress very often. I win a game and it says game over and i have to do the game again. that sucks and is the reason why i havent completed the campaign. However, you do not need to finish the campaign to enjoy this game. Its after all a multiplayer game. Coach vs Coach.I highly recommend this game! Just endure the tutorial matches, they will prepare you for a world of pain. "

												Well, the AI on single player is cheap. Not once have they kicked a touchback, while mine is about 50%. Also I fail dodges quite often, but not the AI, no sir.If you're going to play single player, pick it up on Steam sale, or on Humble Bundle like I did. For almost $50 there's not a lot to it.Not bad, but at least in my single player expierence not worth the full game price. I will say ""recommend"" until I have my taste of multiplayer. "

												Great game that remains so true to the Board Game. So addictive and so strategic. Nothing puts a bigger grin on your face than when you sack the ball & get a touch down, after the opposing team received. I would seriously recommend playing the tutorials first or reading the tabletop rule book before stepping into online or friendly matches. Nows a good time to get it due to the amount of teams, but cant wait till all of them are out.			"

												If your camera view gets stuck to max zoom when you start the game...  try disconnecting your joystick!!!I'm a long time Blood Bowl player,I played the board game, Legendary & Chaos PC version.I've held off buying BloodBowl 2, waiting for a number of patches to come in before I gave it a go.First impressions:Graphically the pitch is not much improvedThe stadium and character animations are niceThe badges that tell you what skills the players have are not really legible on the field at 1440x900 - you have to hover over them. The only time they are really legible is on the roster's individual player page.In several places in the menus the text is poorly sized and almost illegibleThe team roster page is unnecessarily small and does not use the screen effectively resulting in small text.You *can switch off the subtitles*The functionality to rotate the pitch as in BloodBowl 1 is missing - you  press 'C' to get an alternate view but that's it. 'Cntrl"" provides more info about players on the field.The flavour provided by the commentators remains amusing as ever (personal taste)It's bloodbowl & enjoyable.Do I think this game is worth  full price? Absolutely not when you figure in the cost of DLCIs it worth the Â£8  I paid during the steam sale - yesLegendary edition is coming in the summer and will provide improved camera features			"

												Game has potential to grow to be really good in the future.Core gameplay is lot of fun as blood bowl always is and art style is gorgeus.But:Missing some core features:- Always ask on action what skills to use- Grid- Player name/positional tags- Visual ugrade of players on lvl ups(all present in BB:Chaos edition)- Player stats- There are really almost none settings/options/customization in this game at the moment.- Multiplayer League management is not good, Solo league management and settings is almost non existant (you cant even turn off aging in solo nor play ladder)(BBCE has nice open campaign next to story mode)Core gameplay is good, but it is hard to recomend at full prize of 45, +7 for each race at this moment.If you are not super hardcore BB fan, wait till the game gets patched, or is out on sale.If you are hardcore fan of BB then 45eur is not that bad, you will have more than 45hrs of fun here, But you can have that in BBCE for less :(I'm sad that I can't recomend this to everyone.If you are a fan maybe buy this to encourage Cyanide to build on the good core they have in this, but it feels almost like early access game now, sorry.Cynaide promised the they will patch some of the missing features into the game in the future, when it happens I'll be more than glad to to edit my review to positive.Today 24.9. they added both W. Elves and Lizardmen to people who preorded on steam for free, Have to give them credit for that. Unexpected and good move.Changed the review to positive, I play this too much ,even if it is still feature wise inferior to BB:CESeems like cyanide will try to improve the game over time, and they are really putting out patches.17.12.2015 - They Added Grid, player stats, coach view, inducement opposing team view, skill fixes.Also announced that 4 next races will be free to all BB2 owners.Just buy this now and have fun, they are really caring for the game this time :)			"

												3rd Edit (July 2016): Cyanide have finally seen sense and changed the cost of orc blitzers to 80k. It has taken almost a year but they've finally done it. The support for this game has been slow but generally good and Cyanide have listened to their player base. All they need to do now is make stadium upgrades optional and stop this stupidity of having anything over 150k adding to your tv.The slow output of new races is acceptable as long as it continues.However the AI is still absolute rubbish. This is not a single player game. I repeat THIS IS NOT A SINGLE PLAYER GAME.This game still isnât perfect but given the number of hours Iâve spent on it I have decided to change my review to positive.*******Since writing, Cyanide have released an update with a grid, names and skills toggle, which frankly still isn't as good as in their original game. Simply because in BB1 you could play the game with these toggles on, now they take up so much of the screen you can't see what's going on.On the positive side they have got rid of the laboured walking the players used to do to their positions at set up. It was particularly painful watching the treeman walk to his allotted square. They now teleport.Statistics are finally available, although it would be nice to have this as a team overview, rather than having to click on each player to see their individual stats.And in an attempt to woo back their disenfranchised fan base, they have declared that the next four races will be free to existing holders of the game, which is fantastic news. However, until they return the rules to normal and make their new-fangled crap optional, I will not be changing this review to positive. And it would be polite of them to remove the lies they've written all over the BB website about the AI improvements, since they obviously have no intention of fixing that.**********For all of you hanging out, waiting to see whether or not you should buy this game yet, hereâs why you should keep waiting:Because this got really long so hereâs the summary:Good: GraphicsBad: Everything elseIf you want to buy a good game, buy Blood bowl: Chaos Edition. It is a supremely better game.Now the long version:Number of Races â Letâs get this out of the way first. It wouldnât bother me that only a fraction of the all the possible races are available, if Cyanide had provided me with a product that was an improvement over the original game, but they havenât.BB2 is frankly no frills BB1.Blitz mode â Whereâs it gone? Or perhaps I should say, only Blitz mode is available. Why canât I turn off the OP stadium improvements? Now the death roller can stay on pitch for the entire game!!!! [Still a problem as of July 2016]Balance fixing â Some bright spark has decided the GWâs rules need to be âfixedâ. And again, this canât be turned off. You now have to spend your gold because anything above 150k counts towards your TV. WTF? That means when my wood elf team gets decimated against the dwarf death roller, I canât buy any replacement players. [Still a problem as of July 2016]Skill icons â Perhaps these will take some getting used to, but they are too small to distinguish and arenât obvious. It requires you to hover your mouse button above the icon. But to do this you have to click on the player first. So you have to stop what youâre doing, which takes time. So much time. Would it kill them to put the names next to the skills, like they did in the promotional vids? Grid â A lot of people have complained about this. I donât think itâs so necessary with the new UI, but it would still be nice to have a toggle option. [Fixed]Position labels â This is a big one. Not being able toggle names/positions/numbers makes identifying players, which look very similar, really hard. I have thrown blocks against chaos warriors thinking they were beastmen. [Fixed - although they can obstruct veiw]Statistics â Another biggy. I donât know who my top scorer is in any of my teams. I donât know whoâs suffered the most injuries. Why the hell not? This is part of the beauty of the game. This is what gives character to our players. More than fancy graphics. [Fixed - but cannot view whole team]Fancy Graphics â While weâre on the subject of graphics. I would like to point out that the only thing Cyanide have improved is the graphics. But who cares? In my opinion this is the last thing you fix. Until you have a playable game, who cares if it looks pretty.More stats â You canât examine the line-up of the opposing team in the inducement stage before the game starts. In BB1 you could click on the match record after the game and see the opposing coachâs stats (percentage of games won/lost etc.). You could examine his other teams. You canât do that anymore. Why not? [Fixed]Matchmaking â Matchmaking is horrible. Teams with unbalanced TVs come up against one each other all the time. [Fixed-ish]Slow set up â Every time you move your players before kick-off, they have to go through the action of actually running to where you told them to go, rather than simply appearing there. Great! It looks cool, like the action replays of my players hitting their opponents. But after the first game, Iâd like to turn it off (as I assume most people did with the animations) because it simply wastes time. [Fixed]AI â Now I know not everyone cares about the AI. BB is a multiplayer game. But I donât always have time for a two hour game that I canât pause. And when I donât, I would like to play against something challenging. To be honest the promise of improved AI was the reason I bought BB2 in the first place. Otherwise I could have carried on with Chaos Edition (which is a better game â not just a bit better, supremely better). Donât get me wrong. The AI is different. It doesnât do the same stupid s**t anymore. It just does different stupid s**t.Is it better?No.On my first kick-off I was delighted to see a team of orcs set up a cage. The second kick-off they received, they started setting up the same cage. Then, halfway through, they just gave up, leaving a whole flank wide open. To make matters worse they never, ever picked the ball up with their thrower. Not once. They always elected to collect it with a Blitzer. Those are examples from one game, but suffice to say I have not even come close to conceding a touchdown to the computer and always win by 5+. I donât want to bore you with more examples. The short of it is that the AI is not an improvement on the old system. Given that Deep Blue could beat a chess master in 1997, is it really too much to ask for AI that plays BB in a way that doesnât totally suck, in 2015? [Still a problem as of July 2016]Conclusion:Given that there are so many features of BB1 that have gone, what really cool things have Cyanide added to make BB2 better? I hear you ask. The answer is nothing. Zip. Zero. Zilch. Not one single thing that isnât cosmetic.Itâs like Cyanide had a meeting with a big piece of butcherâs paper, on which they wrote every aspect of BB1, and then systematically crossed each off. Concluding, perhaps, that no one used those options. The second piece of butcherâs paper, designated for BB2 ideas, they left blank. Then all but the graphics team took a two year holiday.So there we have it. Hopefully I havenât left anything out. I apologise for the length, but so many features are lacking they need to be pointed out. BB2 is no frills BB1. If you want a good game buy Chaos Edition. Donât waste your money on this.			"

												I just got the game on sale, i have every bloodbowl game ever made.I love the new graphics and AI. The game is quite entertaining as it is.Deff worth a buy on sale but not at full price IMO. Why? The previous BB games have a single player Team creation option and campaign. Yes i understand other fans consider this an online game. I dont, and the franchise always had a robust single player campaign where you could create/name your squads then tour albion and compete in various cups. why is that not in this game? It should be for the price you have to pay....Also, and i know most die hard BB fans hate this because it is not true to the board game, theres no ""arcade"" mode! I love Arcade in the original BB games. you want a frenetic and chaotic unpredictable and fun experience, to me the arcade mode was it. it was more of a realtime experience and felt much more like a football game than a turn based strategy game. Its like the original BB games had two games in one because of this! Why take it out!? Im still going to give this game a positive review because the turn based mode is deffinately great and better than the original. But there are so many missing features the original BB had that I suggest you DO NOT buy until theres a sale at least 50% off.			"

												Great game.The learning curve for me was about 10 games (lost most of them) which was a bit frustrating.BUT...it was my bad play and not 'random' dice luck....and there is lots of on-line help to aid the learingin curve.So now having a better understanding of the mechanics I am really enjoying it more even though I loose as much as I win.You do not need the DLC teams to enjoy this game. I am playing mostly with Orc and Skaven teams (part of the base game) adn have had no problem taking on the DLC teams.I haven't played much of teh campaign and have spent most of my time on pvp which is great.

												If you liked the board game then this is a faithful computerised version, at least in spirit and the core gameplay. That said there area few issues:The game is heavily multiplayer focussed, the 'campaign' can't be done with a custom team for example.Team and player customisation is very shallow.Despite charging money for the game there are microtransactions (a pet hate).The announcers, whilst fun, started repeating themselves by my second match.So yes I recommend this game, but not at full price, and not for eneryone.

												33 hours played. I can say that I really like this game. I Haven't played multiplayer yet but this game has high ratings so I'm confidant that multiplayer will be good. If you were a fan from the last Bloodbowl computer game, you will understand that multiplayer wasn't the problem. Bloodbowl on single player was to easy and it really began to get boring. At first Bloodbowl 2 seemed the same but as my team developed, the games started to become much harder and I had to really struggle to win. I am hoping it will stay this way. I still  sure you that Bloodbowl 2 is harder then the original. Campaign mode on Bloodbowl 2 is a little disappointing though. On this mode you have to be the Reikland Reavers and you have to go through a long gaming tutorial even if your familiar with the game. Apart from that, no more real problem. It's a solid game better then the original.			"

												Preface-The Warhammer/40k franchise has always been a well-known staple of tabletop gaming. I am more of a D20 player, myself, but I've always admired Warhammer and its sheer level of depth despite the mechanical simplicity. I love Games Workshop if for no other reason that they have a VAST library of video games within the Warhammer franchise. It's difficult to find players for tabletop matches, let alone be willing to teach/learn all of the mechanics and nuances of the variety of games. PC gaming, especially, opens the doors for AI battles and relative ease of access to real opponents. Bloodbowl, and other Warhammer games have given me a workaround to play against enthusiasts and novices alike without having to memorize too many new rules.That said, if you're a Turn-based strategy player, you're already well aware of the potential heartbreak of RNG. And Bloodbowl 2 is no exception. There are moments where it's baffling how an opponent can dodge so effectively, even if the odds of failure are only 1/6. Times where clutch plays are thwarted by that dumbass rolling double 1's and dropping the ball.The rules are very simple, and compared to the first Bloodbowl game, much more accessible and novice-friendly. The UI improvements are substantial and the graphics and audio are fun, and fitting. The announcers are great, and when they grow stale, the option to turn off the audio (or down) is available.Despite simplicity, the depth of strategy is excellent. I truly didn't think, while playing the tutorial, that it could reach the level of complexity to keep me stumped during a turn. But risk/reward in this game feels very tangible, and the violent, dark-humor atmosphere is simply perfect.I hope there will be future DLC or expansions that add additional customization options, however. They are pretty lackluster. And, to avoid aforementioned repetitive audio, record additional announcer voiceovers. Perhaps even a variety of announcers.TL:DR:Fun. Great audio. (Needs a decent sountrack). Strategy layer and UI exceptional.			"

												Many people complain about how there is a lack of content compared to blood bowl chaos edition, without paying attention. BBCE was not the first or the second BB game it was the third and everything it had in it came after years of development and two other games. Of course there is not as much stuff they changed engine and released it, in my opinion early, so that they could have more money for development. Other people complain about the dlc teams without also realizing that before you had to buy Legendary edition and later Chaos edition to get more teams. The devs do care, they recently added a lot of content that people wanted. They even announced that if you own the game you get the next 4 teams free. I would say that if you enjoy a strategy game where if you try and learn what you did wrong rather than blaming dice rolls you will win, then i would say buy it.			"

												This game can be summed up in two words: Frustrating and Fun. This game throws both of these at you in abundance. As this is based on a board game, everything that happens is based on die rolls. Nuffle (n. from ancient entity called ""NFL."" God of dice and chance) is sometimes completely against you. I have lost games because of malevolent dice, but I have also won that way. Your players sometimes can't pick up the ball when it's just laying there on the ground not moving. That said, it's a strategy game that's loosely based on Football. And you get to play as Lizardmen (Note: DLC). You bite, kick, punch, and generally batter the other team into submission, then casually waltz into the end zone for a single point.       It's sort of like turn based Mutant-League Football, only more violent. And you get to play as Lizardmen. Also, for some reason, the plural form of Saurus in this game is Saurus. Oh well.			"

												Edit: Having looked through the other reviews, the vast majority of the negative reviews are from Blood Bowl fans who think the game is lacking features found in other formats, particularly BB:CE. This is fair, but completely glosses over the fact that Blood Bowl is an amazing game that has been going strong for over 20 years and is well represented in Blood Bowl 2. The missing features will come with time, but this is still a great way to play a great game.--I picked up the game in Jan 2016, and I belive it's been patched a few times since launch. I'm a BB fan from back in the day, and came to this after recently playing a few games on fumbbl. I was convinced after watching streamers play the Crendorian Invitational which makes for decent e-sports viewing.This is a solid, intuitive and playable rendition of Blood Bowl. It's easy on beginners, building up the rules slowly, but caters to old hands by showing you the dice roll log (so you can see how many you missed by when your gutter runner trips over his own feet on the second go for it).Upsides:   Looks fantastic  Made with a decent sense of humour  Easy for beginners  Good UI  Seems to have a solid league system and a decent player base on PC  Performance is good (I'm playing on a 2012 iMac using Bootcamp and it works flawlessly).Downsides:  Single Player campaign built up to the full ruleset too slowly for me (as I know the rules)  Some deviations from the living rulebook, which is a shame  UI sometimes lets me down when I make unintentional dodges or GFI  Developers ran out of time and it seems they cut a lot of cosmetic details (e.g. all cheerleaders and fans are human)  Expensive especially when DLC is included "

												I've played the table top, the old dos version as well as Blood Bowl, Blood Bowl II is a sweet upgrade. The games are longer which is tedious, the time spent on the previous games were quicker. That said, its sweet. The graphics and action shots are nice. The commentary is improved and still gives me a chuckle when I have a moment to listen. I am eagerly looking towards the new races, my Undead :).The Current price is sweet and you will get the 4 new races when they come out. Double Sweet. I have the game, bought it day one. Really Really enjoy and give it 2 thumbs up. "

												Edit: Having looked through the other reviews, the vast majority of the negative reviews are from Blood Bowl fans who think the game is lacking features found in other formats, particularly BB:CE. This is fair, but completely glosses over the fact that Blood Bowl is an amazing game that has been going strong for over 20 years and is well represented in Blood Bowl 2. The missing features will come with time, but this is still a great way to play a great game.--I picked up the game in Jan 2016, and I belive it's been patched a few times since launch. I'm a BB fan from back in the day, and came to this after recently playing a few games on fumbbl. I was convinced after watching streamers play the Crendorian Invitational which makes for decent e-sports viewing.This is a solid, intuitive and playable rendition of Blood Bowl. It's easy on beginners, building up the rules slowly, but caters to old hands by showing you the dice roll log (so you can see how many you missed by when your gutter runner trips over his own feet on the second go for it).Upsides:   Looks fantastic  Made with a decent sense of humour  Easy for beginners  Good UI  Seems to have a solid league system and a decent player base on PC  Performance is good (I'm playing on a 2012 iMac using Bootcamp and it works flawlessly).Downsides:  Single Player campaign built up to the full ruleset too slowly for me (as I know the rules)  Some deviations from the living rulebook, which is a shame  UI sometimes lets me down when I make unintentional dodges or GFI  Developers ran out of time and it seems they cut a lot of cosmetic details (e.g. all cheerleaders and fans are human)  Expensive especially when DLC is included "

												So, you're interested in Blood Bowl. Let's start with the basics. I think a lot of reviews tread the same (not necessarily correct) ground. So, I thought I'd make my own.Blood Bowl is set in an alternate universe of Warhammer Fantasy, where instead of war all conflicts are solved through the titular sport Blood Bowl. In Blood Bowl you play as a coach guiding your teams through games. It plays like the unholy cross between turn based strategy and American football. It also has elements of persistence between games, you can build up you're bench, and/or, have your player get injured or skilled up.Onto the main question, why should I play Blood Bowl? It's truely a unique experience (and I don't use that lightly.) This is for two main reasons. First, the experience of training, playing with, and occasionally rebuilding your team is wildly different between races and even individual teams. This team might have a previously useless fodder of a zombie score a touchdown, get strength on a level up, and then become a star of your team. The next team's ogre could die to a foul the second game of the season and you could save and play well to make your team the favorite for the next season.If you've read other reviews you've probably heard some combination of three things: 1. ""It's just luck."" In Blood Bowl every action can fail. Usualy the closest thing to a guarantee you get is a 1/36. This can lead to similar experience to a competitive card game, trying to minimize risk and maximize reward. However due to the fact you have 11+ actions a turn, and most actions have a (very) small chance of permanently killing a player. This leads to a lot of people getting very salty, so if you have a propensity towards getting tilted, this may not be the game for you.2. ""Claw/Mighty Blow/Pilling On is broken."" The review section isn't really the place for balance complaints, unless it's totally game breaking. None of these are more prevalent than block or dodge. What people have an issue with is not the balance, but the fact that they help bashy teams get more injuries. It's easy to be tilted at claw when it gets you're star Dwarf killed by a Skaven.3. ""Just get Blood Bowl Chaos Edition."" This has a lot of validity. Let's look at pros and cons. Chaos Edition has more teams, and is less expensive. Because of this, I would recomend Chaos Edition if you are already familiar with Blood Bowl. However, Blood Bowl 2 has infinitly better and more useful U.I. If you want to learn the game, then you're are gonna have a lot easier time with Blood Bowl 2, than Chaos Edition, or even the physical game. In addition the team gap is shrinking, because more teams are still being released, but the price gap is getting bigger, at the same time. "

												If you liked that board game, this adaptation is great. I enjoy the graphisms, animation, atmosphere of the game. The rules are accurate, The frustration that many experience with the dice rolls is actually very similar to what you can experience with the original board game and I don't mind it. As a fan of the board game, I would rate this game 10/10.One could criticise the small amount of teams available and the DLCs prices.But the reason why I cannot recommend this game is that you cannot create your own multiplayer league and fill it with AI. That was the main reason I bought this game: to be able to play a full season with few friends with dozen of teams, watching our players evolve, get injured, etc. My friends and I own the board game. The idea of playing the pc version was to get to play a lot more matches. We dont want to play with other players because we want to be able to have our own rythm of match play. AI is great for this ! All the other football games nowadays propose that feature.And after owning this game for a year.... that's why I played so little on it. There's no point.			"

												Blood Bowl is the best one vs one turn based game ever made. Think that's a bold claim? Just remember it's nearly 30 years old now and Jervis Johnson and the other chaps who invented it are amongst the finest games designers in the world. There aren't any other games that balance random dice with a wide tactical playbook so well.Cyanide were a little slow on the uptake but they've made a nice job of it this time around. Good graphics (if not too well optimised, it crashes my monsterously powerful gaming rig on the highest settings occasionally) and a much improved UI (compared to the first Blood Bowl game) have proven to me that they're a competent gaming company. I'm not going to comment too much on the DLC pricing, to be honest I'm really not that bothered about it... if you were going to play the tabletop game it'd be WAY more expensive than this, and they've done a nice job of each team.

												Fantastic game.This is a must play if you enjoy turn based strategy games. Some people are upset about the amount of dlc on offer, but I feel the developer has been pretty good about it. They even offered the first 5 teams for free if you owned the game before the teams were released. If you're smart about when buy this then you can actually get a pretty good deal. For example I purchased this during the last Steam sale, so I only payed 10 bucks for this. If price is an issue for you I would wait until the legendary edtion is released in a few months and buy it them. The legendary edtion will feature 20+ teams, and other features not currently in the game.			"

												What can I say other than this game is awesome for anyone who is a fan of Blood Bowl.  I agree with some that the massive lack of playable races at this point is a let down, but in time as races are released it will get far better, and a massive upgrade to prior releases of this franchise.The fact you can either play the single player campaign, or take part in a massive (and I do mean massive) online community match by joining one of many leagues available to you.  Whether you enjoy Blood Bowl for its competitive nature, or just enjoy seeing a dwarf kill a treeman, this game is for you.I recommend this game highly even with its lack of a halfling team at the time of this review.

												Unless graphics are an absolute deal-breaker AND you intend to only play multiplayer, save your money and get BB1 Chaos Edition.  There is still a multiplayer community, it has many more races to choose from, and most importantly to me, it actually has a single player game worth playing.  BB2's single player experience is practically non-existent.  You can create a custom league or play a story mode, but the career mode from BB1 is gone--and that was my favorite part of the game.  The devs clearly only cared about multiplayer.			"

 Pros:  Solid turn-based strategy core Fantastic animations Filled with great dark humour Races are unique in feel and gameplay Cons:  Difficult learning curve Mediocre story mode Few races in the base game, requires DLC purchases Verdict: Recommended Everyone that has ever seen me boot up Blood Bowl 2 has given me the same reaction. A smirk and a curious look asking:""So what, is this some sort of turn-based American football?""Yes. It is also the  best sports game ever made.Set in an alternate Warhammer universe, Blood Bowl 2 (ref. as BB2) is a turn-based strategy game, pitting two players (local or online) or a player and an AI controlled opponent against each other. Each player has their own team, with unique players, each packing their own strenghts and weaknesses. Like in any American football game, the goal is the same: get the ball to the endzone.""Is that an orc there? And why is a dwarf beating the duck out of that guy?There's plenty variety in BB2, with the game and DLC totalling 14 races, possibly more to come. Each race has some customization options in how many of each player will you want. For example, the Human team will always have some number of cheap, expendable linemen, but they can also buy some Blitzers and an Ogre for a more aggressive approach or they might forego the latter and get some Catchers and Throwers. The Orcs might want to trade in their giant Troll to a fast snotling and a backup lineman, etc. Finally, extra rerolls, apothecaries and more can round out your team. This leads to a player having many, many playstyles, which differ wildly from one another.""Holy cricket, is that a Yeti? Did... did that Yeti just kill your player??""From the name, it's pretty obvious that Blood Bowl isn't just about gently taking the ball on a stroll to the opponent's endzone. Combat makes up for a lot of the game, whether your team likes it or not. There, you can see the carefully crafted animations for each unique unit. The visceral thrill of seeing a goatman ramming into an elf so hard he backflips is unforgetable. On the same note, the animations for moving, standing up, even running that extra distance is different for each race and each unit, and that shows how much work was put into this game. ""Oh, okay, so the bigger percentage means you'll more likely to succeed? Wait, why did your guy just fall down while running? Chance is a huge part of BB2, so there goes my first warning: if you hate not having complete control of the consequences in a strategy game, stay away. The chance aspect of the game isn't just your PokÄmon hitting theirs for 38 damage and not 40, and it also isn't a ""fun way to tell stories"" like in Hearthstone. Chance is an integral part of the game. A wise player said: Blood Bowl 2 is about managing risks. So if you can't handle the game failing you on a roll you had 87% to succeed thrice in a row, stay away. Don't bother claiming the random number generator is broken, don't bother claiming the other player cheats, it's just chance. And it's amazing. The chance management and trying to use risks to your advantage makes BB2 sort of unique in my eyes. It's fascinating as much as it is frustrating. And the Schadenfreude from seeing the enemy absolute wreck themselves right in front of your endzone is captivating.""We can play together, right? Let me get my controller, then. What do you mean I won't need one?Blood Bowl 2 has an online mode with an active community. I'd recommend it if you have previous Blood Bowl experience or just want more challenge than the AI can offer. Which isn't exactly awful, and is actually my prefered method of playing BB2. Playing in a league is fun, since I can manage the team, level up the players and eventually replace them once they die. The game also features a decent-size story mode, which acts like a glorified tutorial that barely does its job. You will still likely need to read up on the game rules or watch some videos online. So there goes my second warning: stay away if you dislike complex rules. This is a  strategy  game first and foremost, and quite complex as well, so if you aren't willing to put in some work to see a carefully managed team of blue lizards stomping the everloving duck out of pale-skin pointed ear people, you should reconsider buying. If, however, you don't mind to put in a little work before digging in, then you're going to love your stay. Keep in mind that it is pretty easy to learn once you see someone play this game, which means that playing local-multiplayer with hot-seat is simple. There have been several instances where I just invited a spectating friend to play against me and we both had a blast.""That was a great match! Let's play again, I want to pick the Undead!"" By design, Blood Bowl 2 was never intented to appeal to mass market audiences. It mixes two fairly niche genres - American football videogames and Warhammer - inside a bowl of turn-based luck dependant gameplay. But if this strange stew interests you and you wouldn't object to learning this game for a bit, I would definitely recommend you this purchase.			"

												Haven't tackled multi-player yet, and I'm really enjoying the game (Updated)Enjoyed the campaign since I'm new to the series and it's a tutorial on the game.   I very much recommend the game as I venture into multi-player.  No it's not balanced, and yes it has random rolls but it is very strategic.  They will add teams over time and correct the few bugs in the game.For those of you that despise the RNG of the game.  Great games such as backgammon do have a random element, and is the best comparison rather than a game of chess where a superior oponent will always beat an unskilled one.  I do think there is surprising depth so you 'mitigate' those chances of failure so that you stand a very good chance of beating an unskilled oponent.  Some teams do match up poorly versus others as in real football (which this is clarly 'NOT').  If you don't enjoy randomness in the game, this isn't for you.  After 100 hours I'm starting to learn that the ruleset is more complex than I first thought, and I keep learning to improve my game.  It soes suck to play better than an opponent, and suffer bad luck-- but sometimes you do get lucky at the last second to win and tie versus an opponent much better than you.  Over time, it does even out.  Although not for everyone, this is a great turn based strategy game best played against other players.  As a side note, each race is distinct and plays differently which adds replayability to the game.  I'm now an avid fan.			"

												There is absolutely 0 reason to buy this right now. Chaos Edition has all the races and features, while this has HD grass that will make your computer lag. There is NO DIFFERENCE between the games themselves outside of cosmetic and stupidâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥because at the end of the day the tabletop Blood Bowl rules are what they are, and that's what you are craving to play. You aren't craving HD graphics or all this fluff... Oh and the races that are in the game are the most generic ones, but to each their own I guess. Just know as far as actual features that relate to the actual game of Blood Bowl go, this is a complete downgrade and the price tag is a JOKE considering what you'll have to pay to get the rest of the races. If you buy this now, you will have to buy every expansion they will milk over the next few years... And in 2017 you will have paid a stupid amount to get what you could've had in 2013 for significantly less $$... Of course without the features you were dying to see such as: the camera annoyingly zooming in for no reason, the UI being worse, the players themselves looking just as wonky as they did with the old graphics, the game being significantly slower... Go directly to the Blood Bowl: Chaos edition page and purchase. The only actual downside is this game obviously has a lot more people playing online, but still I really only have to wait 3 minutes max to find an opponent on Chaos edition			"

												Let me preface this review by saying that this is NOT a game for everyone. There's a ton of hidden depth to the strategy and a lot of it isn't very clearly explained by the game's campaign/tutorial, and true to any Games Workshop property, it relies on a lot of chaotic rolls of the dice. If you're not willing to see your star player roll snake eyes on a two-dice block against a teeny Goblin, knocking your player over instead of the wee Gobbo, potentially KILLING your star player if his armor breaks, then this is not a game for you.However! If you're the sort of player who knows how to mitigate risk, is willing to learn a slightly clunky game system right out of the 80's, and can revel in the utter chaos that this game creates, then this is an absolute joy to play. It's a mix of Rugby, American Football, and Warhammer Fantasy's own special brand of SENSELESS VIOLENCE. Describing it in text isn't quite sufficient; I'd highly recommend watching cKnoor's videos on Youtube if you want to see a pro play, or you could watch WOWCrendor's Crendorian Invitational if you want to see just what kinds of wonderfully dumb tight spots the dice can get you into.Pray to Nuffle that your dice be blessed, strap on your helmet, and drive your skull into the gut of an Ork.

Take a chance elsewhere.Its hard to rate a game where almost every single action is purely based on chance. After 10 hours, I guess I rolled poorly as I simply cannot find myself enjoying it. The campaign, while although intially enjoyable, becomes tedious as its solely Human focused, so unless you enjoy playing that race, an entire game mode is effectively wasted. However, it does serve its point in being a basic introduction to the mechanics of Blood Bowl, so keep that in mind if you are a new player.Graphically, the game is actually rather poor. I have quite the high end rig (i7-5820, 32gb 2400MHZ RAM, Titan X running off SSD) and this game gives me the option of either having 60+ fps at high detail on UHD, or sub 50fps at Ultra on the same resolution. Which is odd, as it basically looks rather shoddy with repeating animations, no real variation in character models/cheerleaders/spectators. GTA5 and MGS5 run significantly better while looking better.At the end of it all though, it comes down to how much you can favour chance. Nuffle is a harsh God to worship, and I have apparently offered poorly, as his favour towards me in this game is considerably lacking. Team unbalance is rampart at all levels of play (Chaos feel particularly weak all round, while Dwarves can do no wrong), and the match making currently will queue new teams with hardcore seasoned veterans. Honestly, wait for the full game to be released (all teams, all models updated, all stadiums added, etc) before purchasing this. You can simply chance your money elsewhere and be better for it. "

												Important Update: Cyanide Studios has announced that anyone who is considered an ""owner"" of the game before the upcoming four races' DLC comes out will, in fact, be receiving those races for free.  This is wonderful news, and if they aren't going to be peddling races that were included in older iterations of the game, I would consider that a win for the community.**ORIGINAL REVIEW BEGINS HERE**Mechanically, I feel this game is loads of fun when it's not generating enough salt for you to line your margarita glass or lick a tequila shot.  I can recommend it on its source material alone, the animations and announcers are fun and funny.  I enjoy it, and I recommend it on those grounds.However, the large backlash is due in large part to the following aspects of the game, both of which I disapprove of along with many others it seems:I cannot approve of its DLC model, and the negative reviews do attest to a large quantity of team-building content removed for sale later.  It's a practice I won't support, hence why I got my key from a third-party.  I hope sincerely they release some free content on top of the paid teams.  Creative Assembly is being hit by the same backlash for an almost identical reason in their preorder promotion of the Chaos warriors faction for Total War: Warhammer.  Cutting content to sell later isn't good business, it's the cannibalization of your fanbase for money.  I'll never approve of it and i'll wait for discounts or buy 3rd party to circumvent supporting their nonsense.Additionally, an in-game microtransactions system exists for cosmetic and skin purposes.  I don't really like it's execution... While the cosmetics are neat and its always nice to add extra-level customization for a Warhammer-inspired title (I don't entirely hate the mechanic, I'm guilty of buying skins in games I wanted to support), the business model seems disappointing to me.  I wish it weren't so scummy, because I want to be able to recommend this game with verve and passion.  I can recommend it, but I don't have much verve...			"

												Despite all of the negative comments about how the game didn't improve over the predecessor (which I have tried but couldn't really get into), Blood Bowl 2 may well be the first great Warhammer game in years.Of course there are bugs and DLC is a stickly move. However the graphics are crisp and the gameplay itself is magnificent with more transparent dice-management. If the developers decide to dig deeper into their creative pockets the game will surely be a masterpiece.I am in love with this game man. 2/5 Stars.			"

												This game is so messed up, I donÂ´t even know where to start...While the first Blood Bowl was at least made with some appreciation of the Boardgame, this version is missing any depth, detail and content.The campaign is to introduce you into the rules and the game, a tutorial. Nothing more.The Solo leagues are boring as hell. In BB1 you had a nice map with different places and you needed to achieve stuff to play the next tournament. Level up your players and buy them equippment. This one here? Nothing. Just a roster.All of this could be ignored if the basic game would be at least bug free.  At this state right now, the game could still be a beta.On top of that, its a really bad console port. Just click into the graphics options and you will see it. Not even an option to go full screen or windowed. I will get my refund via Steam and leave this dissapointment behind.			"

												Too many negatives, and just not enough positives.Negatives: * So few models, fans all human, cheerleaders all human, etc...  * Only player faces can be changed (and there is like 3 per type). * Saving setups is useless, the players are not placed in same positions. * Woeful AI (it still can't pass the ball using passing teams). * Dice stacking, always in favour of the AI to ensure that it remains even moderately competitive. * Performance, at best substandard, but its clearly very poorly optimised. * Campaign, utterly terrible, the fact its only humans, even worse. * AI leagues very limited. * Game centred solely around multi player * No additional features (new skills, expanded skills, skills or skill sets made more balanced). * etc...Positives * None really. I feel ripped off in every way.			"

												The game itself is pretty unbalanced and unforgiving. It would takes months to learn good strategy and everyone online gleefully brutalizes new players and taunts them viciously while doing so. There are mp good resources for learning the game. Don't listen to anyone who tells you to go to BBTactics or any other site, they're all years old and never updated. The community is not very good or gracious. Add to that that trhe RNG for the game is dreadfully broken and over the course of dozen of games I tracked my rolls and consistently experienced highs and lows FAR outside the normal distribution of numbers. I suspect the programmers designed the game to swing wildly instead of have a fair and balanced distribution. The graphics are nothing special, but that isn't the point of the game. The 'commentary' is repetitive and boring, you'll hate it after your 3rd match. You will see the same 3 or 4 teams in multi-player over and over and over again because the game so strongly favors these teams that the only reason to play anything else is if you enjoy watching it get killed. When the game makes matches it will pair you with teams that are as much as double your value and give you 'inducements' to 'even' the board. They do not. Your entire team will be massacred by a gloating â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ on the other side. Hope you had fun with that. This happened to me twice within my 2 week play period.			"

												Not worth the full price.Heres why:- The animations are noot good. Clumsy orcs, dirt flying like in a rally racing game, the players are waving when selected like theyre need to be picked for schools lacross team or smth...  just makes the game look â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ somehow.- Few animations and even fewer models. This point is mentioned in other reviews i think. Why would you spend time and manpower on animating the casterdesk in the friggin menue, when the lack of animations and models INGAME is obvious?- Poor response to input, bugs while targeting/clicking n stuff. This isnt a shooter, nothing rly suprising is going to happen in terms of UI and inputs, but with a response on clicking this poor (having to deselct and reselct all the time) this game makes the standart 2 minutes turns the REAL challenge in multiplayer mode.- UI teammanagement is still anoying. there is  always one submenu more, for no reason. Just put everything you need to see about a team on ONE PAGE wtf. Even console users can read a little bit of text once in a while. Creating a team is a pain in theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ ending up deleting and restarting way to often. I dont want to get used to how it works -> it should work the first time anyway.So for the good stuff:- Its BB. I mean its BB... But that credit goes to Games Workshop.- Graphics are better then in BB1. Cool huh? But this isnt really an achievement come to think of the years between the two games.- Disconnecting issues seem to be fixed. But again thats just something that shouldnt have been nessesary in the first place.- Some annoying UI stuff from the first game is fixed.Finally:- I wont rant about missing teams, thats just how BB1 started and it happy endet for that means.- So we trade bugfixes und network and UI and Graphics update for a sloppy, annoying UI and poor animations.= Not a good job by the developers, rather dissapointing.If you like BB youll prob get it anyways like me but youll prob feel like have spend to much money (like me)oh yea, before i forget: No woodelves because i was short on money that month with the pre-order sale? Thats worth flipping a finger to cyanide!			"

												So, even tough the review is marked as negative it's not gonna be a rant on the game. The game, even tough it's far from complete, is fine. Let's do a quick pros and cons before the analysis:PROS- The game is as we always knew it, no big changes in the rules or anything- No blitz mode- Visuals are nice (even tough they are not last gen nice)- The cabalvision thing is well implemented and funny- Stadiums are awesome- Races are released at a good paceCONS- The pricing model is aweful- Very few team and players customization (major con to me)- LOTS of leavers online for no real reason- Developers really don't seems to listen to the community- Major Races haven't even been announced (Khemri, Goblins, Vampire Counts)- There's a in-game currency, but you can't do much with it aside buying team colours- Overall feels incompleteThat pretty much sums it all up. I've been playing BB since the first game came out, and always had a blast with it. The reason why I'm giving it a bad review is because, at full price, right now it's not worth the money. I just got it on the 66% sale and so far I'm happy with it, and I also got the Lizardmen DLC (always been a fan of them), but at full price plus a 7 bucks DLC? No way man. They made some improvements from the last one like the 45 degrees camera angle, the HUD being flashier and telling you the dices results, some thing are still kinda the same (like the AI, like seriously? They said getting a better AI was one of their main focuses and it's still the same crap), and some are worse, mainly the Players not getting new gear as they level up, the Season mode il less captivating, and the AI still â¥â¥â¥â¥s your dice throws pretty clearly.Overall I'd say: if you are a long time BB fan and you've played the past games, wait for a good sale and get this; if you never played BB and you don't care much about graphics get Chaos Edition			"

												Blood Bowl 1 has been one of my favourite games to play with a friend. It's only flaw was the lack of multiplay in season mode. So I've been waiting anxiously for BB2. Now that I've played it for about 60 hours, I have a mixed feeling with it.The game is basically Blood Bowl 1 with updated graphics and multiplay. That isn't a bad thing. BB1 already had everything in place. First complaint comes from single player campaign, as you can play it only with human team. After playing through the campaign, I started coaching my own team online. And there was the games' major problem. I had bought the game and both DLC teams, so I knew the team options are going to be limited. In fact, it almost crippled the whole game. I really miss the Norse or Amazon teams, as those were my favourite in BB1. Also, knowing that I have to pay even more in future to get more teams pisses me off.If you liked BB1 as a game, youre gonna like BB2 also. So ask yourself which is more important to you:1) Lots of different teams to choose from, but multiplaying only as hotseator2) Improved graphics and possibility to play online, but (very) limited selection, of different races/teamsIf you chose option 1, I suggest you continue playing BB1 and wait BB2 discount offer . If you chose option 2 and don't mind paying extra for more teams, go ahead and buy this game.*If you are an experienced Blood Bowl player, you may want to add me.. ;)			"

Turn Based Arena Football With Fantasy Races and RNGBlood Bowl 2 is one of the best games I have played in a while. I think we can all agree that running around a football field with teams full of fantasy races bashing each other while trying to score touchdowns is simply an awesome premise. The game is turn based, which I love, and it involves quite a bit of dice rolling, which makes each match unique and unpredictable. The ""turnover"" mechanic is brilliant. If you fail an action during your turn and one of your players gets knocked over, then your turn immediately ends.This leads to nailbiting choices like: ""Yes, if I make this risky block, I'll score a touchdown. But if my player falls over instead, then my opponent will be in a good position to score. Do I wait for a better opportunity next turn? Or do I go for it now?""StrategyThere is real strategy to be had here. Manage your odds. Do everything that is safe first in case your rolls go south and end your turn. Learn how to set up block strings and use the all-important once-per-turn ""blitz"" move. Don't make unnecessary dice rolls. Your strategy will also vary greatly depending on which race you choose to play. Dwarves? Bash up your opponent's players and watch as they are carried off the field on stretchers. High Elves? Look for tiny openings in your opponent's defense and exploit them with your high agility, speed, and passing skills.GraphicsThe art direction and graphics are first rate. I don't think I'll ever get tired of seeing my ogre (I named him ""Slurple"") smack down the opposing players. I still laugh out loud when someone fails a ""Go For It"" roll and goes tumbling to the ground and fumbles the ball. The prat falls and the accompanying sound effects are *perfect*. The person who designed this really knows their stuff.The two commentators in the game (Bob and Jim) make me chuckle as well. When my ogre is lying prone on the ground, tries to get up, but misses his ""intelligence"" roll and goes nowhere, then one of the announcers might claim ""I've seen *mushrooms* that look smarter than that.""StabilityThe game is rock solid stable. I have not seen even one crash or freeze up during the 63+ hours I have been playing. I did encounter two bugs involving player lineups and gold inducements, but these were fixed very quickly.In the future, I think I would like to see more robust league creation options, as well as an easier way to see what skills players have on the field. The negative reviews I have read are written either by veterans of Blood Bowl 1 who dislike the fact that some of their favorite features are not in the game, by people who do not understand how randomness works, or by people who feel the game is too expensive. Note that there will be additional teams added to the game, but you will need to purchase them at about $7 each if you would like to play as them. The base game comes with eight teams.In any case, I am very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend Blood Bowl 2 to anyone who might enjoy turn-based strategy with RNG meshed with football in a high fantasy world.Please follow this link if you are a new player and would like to read some helpful guides:http://forum.bloodbowl-game.com/viewtopic.php?f=61&t=5500 "

												I'm going to start this review by admitting that I never played the original Blood Bowl. I own it, and I always wanted to like it, but the seeming overcomplexity of the system kept me from ever getting into it.Blood Bowl 2 was pretty much the perfect game for me. The UI is clean, simple and easy to understand. The games are pegged at a nice length (usually around 40 minutes for me) and the solo league experience provides enough of a challenge for me as a new blood bowl player to be entirely engrossing. There are a large number of teams (currently eight), though hardcore blood bowl fans will probably be disappointed by the selection. More will almost certainly be released as DLC, but at the $45 price point that's frankly to be expected. TLDR: If you're interested in a turn based strategy game with a fantasy sports twist this is certainly a game for you. If you're on the fence, or if you're a hardcore blood bowl fan you're probably better served waiting for a sale.			"

												Lock your doors and turn off your phones sports fans, it's time for Blood Bowl! The game that mashes American Football with Warhammer and ends up with comical results.First up, I adore Blood Bowl so this review will be a bit biased.Pros:-UI has been polished up from the original title.In game commentary is more entertaining.Currently available teams are well balanced against each other.Teams are persistent, no more rebuilding a team for each league you enter.New Bretonnian team.Cyan implimenation could be interesting if used purely for cosmetics as announced.Cons:-End Turn button located in an awkward area means you can sometimes misclick before you get used to it.Selecting a player at the edge of the screen can sometimes be a chore due to the player information popups.Single player campaign is a glorified tutorial.No more multiplayer hotseat function.Leagues have a tendency to be dominated by Clawpomb Chaos teams.Only a handful of teams available at launch.Two teams hidden behind a pre-order wall.Yes, I know the con list is slightly larger than the pro list. However, most of the cons are minor issues to me and I will continue to rack up the hours on this game.			"

												OK, so the premise for BB2 is pretty simple. You have a great, tested and proven game system to translate into a decent UX/UI experience and add some 3D fluff to. And while BB2 looks nice, the interface is clumsy, the gameplay a bit unelegant and there's little bugs everywhere that ruin the experience;- Why does the AI keep taking down random players rather than defending?- Why does the game sometimes fail to recognise a player standing in the end zone for a TD?- Why is it so frustrating trying to work out how to buy team assets the first time one plays?It's a pretty bad rendition of BB guys, sry. Not recommended.			"

												I would like to start this review by saying one thing, if you are the type of gamer who hates games with dice rolling and gets angry when things don't go your way then DO NOT buy this game.  This game is very dice heavy and until you learn the rules and how to play properly you will make a lot of mistakes and end up blaming your losses on the dice rather than your own lack of knowledge of the games rules.  However if you like the idea of a complex dice based sports game and don't mind learning the rules then this is the edition to start with.The main improvements this game has over the first Blood Bowl are the graphics and the UI, the original game was well known for its awful interface that left new players scared and confused while this one makes it much easier for new players to see the chances of success on things like dodges and ball pick ups.  And quite honestly that is all that this has over the original game, this isn't really that bad a thing as the UI was a serious issue but I feel like more could have been improved such as the multiplayer league system which now has less options that in the first game.Other things I would like to see improved is the single player AI, in the first game it was woeful and to be honest it is no better in this version.  I have yet to lose a game against the AI and haven't even conceded a single touchdown against it yet.  While this may be good for newer players as it gives them a pretty much braindead AI to practice against it would have been nice to be able to have a challenging single player mode for once.  The multiplayer is still where the meat of the game is and it remains much the same although they have removed the MP lobby that you could use to chat with fellow players before your game and arrange matches etc.The number of teams the game was released with is also a bone of contention for some players as it only has 8 plus the two you got from pre-ordering which is far, far less teams than Blood Bowl Chaos Edition has.  This will eventually sort itself out though as Cyanide have said they will be releasing teams as DLC, this is something I am fine with as long as they pricing of said DLC isn't over the top but I know some people hate DLC so much that it ruins games for them so I thought I should mention it.  However the teams the game comes with should be plenty to suit most players but I would have liked to have had the Undead team in there as part of the base races.There are also still quite a few technical issues still with the game, it causes my graphics card to overheat and crashes the PC unless I use a frame limiter to limit myself to 30fps which I am not okay with and others have reported similar issues with the overheating in this game while other games run fine.  I have also experienced the black screen bug where your screen just goes black but the game is still running fine, you just can't see it.  As for the in game options menu, it is worfully inadequate, you cannot play in fullscreen at all only borderless windowed mode, which is pretty much the same but seems a bit of an oversight.  The graphics options are practically non existent as well, simply choosing from Low to Very High with no advanced options at all.  While I am sure that these things will be patched you may want to hold off for now if these sound like major issues for you.I realise that this review reads quite negatively but I do truly enjoy this game and I think that in a few months time with patches and new races being added it will be the best version but it still doesn't quite edge out the first game yet as they have removed features we liked and added a few things that nobody asked for and some that just make it plain worse (player ageing in leagues?)  Honestly though if you are a brand new player who wants to get into Blood Bowl then buy this edition as it is far more user friendly and better looking to boot.  If you are already a seasoned Blood Bowl 1 coach though I would recommend holding fire until they have fixed the worst bugs and maybe added some more teams, though if you are playing for multiplayer you will probably have to buy it anyway since I expect it has already massively reduced the number of people playing the first!

												This game really is a blast if you're inclined for a little luck to be thrown in with your strategy. You're playing football in the Warhammer Fantasy universe with the races from Warhammer fantasy. Except you level and learn skills as you play through as the team manager making all the choices you want to influence the design of your team. Dice can be your friend or your enemy as you're playing the game so don't let it get to you if you get a few bad rolls because sometime soon you'll have amazing rolls.We currently have 10 teams in the game which for some reason has people getting very upset because not every team was released out right. Saying Blood Bowl 1 has all the teams therefor 2 must as well. When Blood Bowl 1 came out it had 8 teams on release, 9 after a month and after a year the other teams were released. Give Blood Bowl 2 time, they'll put the rest of the teams in. The game is absolutely worth a purchase and your time, I highly recommend it.			"

												Like Warhammer? Of course you do...Like Football Warhammer style? I'm sure you'll love it once you play it!Like full on contact sports with blood? I know I do!This game is a huge improvement to the original Blood Bowl. Although they're both fun to play, Blood Bowl 2 just brings more ""umph"" to the title. It's better visually and controls seem more improved compared to the original. There's a small learning curve, but once you tackle that, it's second nature. This game is fun and highly enjoyable. Even more enjoyable with friends. Pick your teams, name them, design them, and play pulverize your opponents. I love this game, you should show some love for this title too by purchasing it!

												Don't buy this game! then maybe they'll fix dice in BB3!!!I played 1097 hours Chaos Edition. BB2 and this game has no dice, only dice animation. AI calculates risks before every turn and you have to play in that risk order. there is no dice, only ""yes"" or ""no""s.  This is an ""arcade"" game not a board game ""simulation"".I hope Games Workshop cancels franchise agreement with Cyanide. So we can play this epic board game online. I shared lots of videos about dodging Minotaurs and opened threads on forums about injuring 8 dwarves in a match with skaven, Guess what happened. they supressed or deleted my threads with their forum guard dogs.

My roles are 80-90% worse then the AI's. Rather than trying to counter the other team I workign agenst the fact that I can not roll.Added: Save and Exit game dose not work and knocked me back a game. I had one player die but two where removed from my rosta.This game just feels unfinished or compleated by poor programmers.			"

												I think it's better than Blood Bowl CE, BUT if you want ALL the races, buy CE instead. I don't know whether this one will even get all of them. Guess it depends on how much the people are willing to fork over for them. So far I think we have ""about"" half of all official races. Notably absent are Chaos Dwarfs, The Amazons and some gimmicky teams like Halflings or Goblins for example. I hope they will include all of them eventually. Apparently designing the teams takes a lot of effort and resources, more than in their previous games, because of animation quality, etc. We've had a new team every 2 or 3 months or so now. Best part is, all of them have been free for original buyers. Good backpedalling on their part. I'm not any sort of Hardcore BB fan, so my opinion may not matter to all those table top fans, but I like the representation, the gameplay feels weighty and mostly fun. There is enough strategy involved, but it's still a dice roll game. People have been complaining about rigged dice...I can't confirm that. I've maybe got 10 hours in Multiplayer, it certainly didn't feel unfair, but that's dice for you. Sometimes those 1 % chances happen twice in a row and sometimes your Skink will just slip and die. DRAMA!People have also been complaining about cheaters...dunno, haven't encountered any. Talk to someone who claims that and see if they have actual proof. So far most of the ones yelling on the steam forums about rigged dice could not provide any evidence apart from personal anecdotes (Hint: for a statistic to be valid you would need thousands of hours played...only then can you possibly discern any pattern).If you like turn based fantasy football with violence and Orcs, Demons and Undead, you might just enjoy this. It is a niche product, however. If you don't want to play online, you can also play against the AI in cups and tournaments. For me that is good enough, since I'm no pro anyway. The scene in MP is still very active though, so you should not have trouble finding any games...and of course there are closed leagues as well.Go hit em hard!			"

												I've been playing this quite a lot since release, and I think I've played enough to be confident in making a review.The UI is much better than in Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition. There's a couple of things that could be nicer - hovering over a unit should show the card next to the cursor as opposed to the side, because it can be quite inconsistent as to which one it shows the details of. The settings leaves a fair bit to be desired too - I'd like to disable the subtitles for the commentators, because I have them muted. I'd like more of a choice for which cutscenes I see and which I don't see. I'd like to be able to see a longer history of the roll log. The UI is quite intrusive at times, with the top part covering up the block dice at times. Quite often the camera adjusts itself to an angle that I don't like, so I have to keep readjusting it manually.Other than that, I think it's a great game and definitely worth buying. I'd like to see a mode where you can have a one-off non-friendly game (SPP and injuries enabled) with a friend instead of having to make a league. Killing your friend's best players is a fantastic time investment, go for the 8-player foul.			"

												Blood Bowl 2, to put it simply: It's amazing.An incredible improvement from Blood Bowl 1, simplified UI and upgraded graphics. This is a turn-based strategy-sports game that takes place on the Warhammer universe. You will play as the coach of teams of different races and duke it out on the pit on matches of Blood Bowl!The upgraded graphics make the game feel epic every single moment, the animations are mind blowingly good, you'll see everything, from a Chaos Warrior dropkicking an Elf or a Dwarf beating a Minotaur to a pulp with his ale mug. To this add an action camera and slow motion as this is happening and you'll have epic fights every single time.The added commentary of Jim and Bob will bring you some laughs until it starts getting repetitive, with this said, they do take a big part in the Single Player campaign mode which starts as a tutorial for the first couple of matches and then throws you right into a story mode.On average a match will take about 60 minutes from start to finish so make sure that you have plenty of time before starting a game.

												This is a great game; alas... it is missing some vital features, that a BB game simply must have. - It is not currently possible to see playname/playerrole above your palyers in game. You have to click every single player to find out exactly which of your linemen that player is. When you have 16 players, half of which have levels granting new abilities, then this uncertainty gets real tiresome. A must for afuture update and I would not get the game before it is out.- Likewise, there is no way to see tacklezones constantly when you play, as it were in BB1. You have to start planning a specific move to see them, and you might have missed a tacklezone while moving all your other players, making the grand plan impossible in the end.... too late to reverse it. Togggleable tacklezone grid is a must!- And lastly, it is really annoying that you can't expnd the dice roll log. This is not a must, but it would be a mayor Ui improvement if you could browse back and see all the rolls of a turn just passed; in order to calculate the total cahcne of some amazing move happening. A minor thing, but it would be nice.Before at least the first 2 are in the game, I can't recommend buying it. Instead get BB1: Chaos Edition** It's been confirmed that they are working on a ""tactical view"" and an extended dicelog. Sit tight! the changes will come eventually			"

												For me, Blood Bowl 2 is a disappointment. Many years ago I had the tabletop Blood Bowl game and until now, I had forgotten how little I actually played it. Essentially, I think the problem is that sports are usually fast paced, and this is not. Involving dice rolls slows things down to the point that the excitement disappears. Playing Blood Bowl 2 on the PC is frankly slow and dull. Moreover, the graphics aren't particularly amazing and the commentary has more life than the game, although you wish they would shut up and let you get on with it.In game, the team members have a limited range of actions, and much of the time is just spent knocking over the opposition, or being knocked over by them. The feel of the game is rather like a graphically enhanced version of the Windows classic 'Minesweeper'. I was expecting the action to feel a bit more like XCom: Enemy Unknown, but sadly it doesn't.			"

												Reason for Buying1. Have the board game.2. Played the first computer game.3. Thought the graphics and team editing was cool.ProsGraphics - The game looks much better.Game play is much better with better bells and whistles.When you buy your team you can sell players if you need to change things around.  The last game you were stuck after buying the players.  Just remember that after you play a match, you can no longer sell that player for what you got it for.Computer AI is way better than the last game.  I had a team knock one of my players out of the pitch.  Never happened in the old game unless I boxed myself in.ConsI ordered early and only got 1 of 2 additional races.  I find this shady.  Why not both races?The fully editable teams is a lie.  WHY CAN'T I CHANGE THE PLAYERS NUMBER.  I play humans, love them.  So I want to have my lineman with 50-79, 90-99 numbers, my blitzers 20-49 numbers, catchers 80-89 numbers and throwers 1-19  numbers.The number editor is a HUGE thing for me.  I know it sounds small but i was 100% getting the game for the option of changing numbers.The start of the game and half time is a bit much.I wish that knocking your opponent out of the pitch had the race of the person that knocked the other out of the pitch.  It's always humans.I will play some more and add to this.			"

												Worth the price if your not strapped for cash. Wish more nations were included (more coming in DLC).At this point if your not 100% sold.... Wait for a sale. If you got some extra cash laying around, not a terrible place to put it. The enjoyment far out weights the few issues I have with it.If I had to point my finger at something it would be that they could have added more campaigns (one for each nation would be nice) and more nations in general. Also, some more control and UI options would be nice. For example, the animations on hits gets old when it happens every time. It would be nice if you could toggle it to only occur when an injury is caused. I feel this would not only save time, but also add more tension when it actually does occur. That said, from the feedback they are receiving I wouldn't be surprised if that happens sooner than later.TL:DRIf you got money to blow well worth it, if not wait for sale.			"

												Updated:well well well,seems all the doomsayers are now hiding in their mothers basements at the moment.here we are about a year or so on from the initial release,the plans for Legendary edition have been announced and the future is bright,everything that the community has asked for is now a reality,with some minor exceptions.assuming you got in on BB2 at the start,you will now have 14 teams that cost 0 dollarswith 2 more teams to come out next week,bringing the team list to 16.Legendary edition changes are too numerous to mention so chase this up on youtube,look for Lewpac22's video's on this matter,as he is in thick of the discussions with the Devs involved.In essence by the end of 2017 we will have all the teams (24) plus speciality teams,massive updates to the game options for league and moron management.you name it,you can do it.Price: people can buy LE at full price or if you have the basic version,it will be 50% off?,with the exception of the last 2 teams being released this week.if you havent got BB2 yet,it may be prudent to wait on LE,if you already have BB2,you are in for a treat my friends.it is worth noting,you do not have to buy LE to play against those that do,core mechanic changes are free and universalthe game is in the assendency and going strong,more players more leagues,more team ,more options,and yes,more rage quitting dummy spitters to laugh at,and the best part is now you will be able to mute and ban these freaks.New AI brains and Options for the meek that prefer AI games only,which is good as it was lacking before,but,c'mon people get with the program,be brave,venture into the world of online blood bowl and behold the horror and mayhem in all its glory,watch in real time the descent of mankind .laugh and cry,smash stuff and pull your own hair out,swear to the seven gods to never play the game again,spend money of sessions at the shrink's office,rant and rave on the forums how the game is out to kill you.for it truly is,of course this only lasts until you weaken and fire it up again for another round of....................LETS PLAY BLOOD BOWL   !!!!!!!!!Viva Le Blood BowlNew rating 9/10Terrific improvement over the originalnicer looking, smooth play,neat little extra's,such as your own stadium and upgrade ability for it.Multiplayer,the imporatant part, works flawlessly with the exception of a couple of occasional bugs.No deal breaker here,just annoying when they happen,but,should be remedied.League management options are scarce at the moment but its obvious they are coming later.Pre-order guys ended up getting both bonus teams as they were delayed a couple of days.good sports.So,10 teams available is more than enough for now and more to come.If you like playing H2H turn based games,this is greatNot Recommended if you are just after playing the AI or Single player,while its fine,its no comparison to playing a human opponentBe Warned.......dummy spits and rage quitters are like locusts in this game,so find a good league to join and it willminimize these goons.8/10			"

												There are a lot of things that need to be added to Blood Bowl 2, but, rooted in tabletop Blood Bowl, it's an undeniably fun game and it's gorgeous (as much as you can say a rat ogre is gorgeous). Coming from BB1 and, a long time ago, the tabletop game, I was worried I'd regret buying BB2 after reading all the reviews here, but I haven't. I want more teams as soon as possible (especially Undead), but I still love the game. If you've never played any Blood Bowl, it might be in your best interest to check out the Legendary or Chaos edition of Blood Bowl 1 first though as Blood Bowl isn't for everyone and besides, until more teams are added the old games are still relevant -- I find myself playing both Blood Bowl 2 and Blood Bowl 1: Chaos Edition off and on through the week.

												I've been playing this quite a lot since release, and I think I've played enough to be confident in making a review.The UI is much better than in Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition. There's a couple of things that could be nicer - hovering over a unit should show the card next to the cursor as opposed to the side, because it can be quite inconsistent as to which one it shows the details of. The settings leaves a fair bit to be desired too - I'd like to disable the subtitles for the commentators, because I have them muted. I'd like more of a choice for which cutscenes I see and which I don't see. I'd like to be able to see a longer history of the roll log. The UI is quite intrusive at times, with the top part covering up the block dice at times. Quite often the camera adjusts itself to an angle that I don't like, so I have to keep readjusting it manually.Other than that, I think it's a great game and definitely worth buying. I'd like to see a mode where you can have a one-off non-friendly game (SPP and injuries enabled) with a friend instead of having to make a league. Killing your friend's best players is a fantastic time investment, go for the 8-player foul.			"

												Blood Bowl 2, to put it simply: It's amazing.An incredible improvement from Blood Bowl 1, simplified UI and upgraded graphics. This is a turn-based strategy-sports game that takes place on the Warhammer universe. You will play as the coach of teams of different races and duke it out on the pit on matches of Blood Bowl!The upgraded graphics make the game feel epic every single moment, the animations are mind blowingly good, you'll see everything, from a Chaos Warrior dropkicking an Elf or a Dwarf beating a Minotaur to a pulp with his ale mug. To this add an action camera and slow motion as this is happening and you'll have epic fights every single time.The added commentary of Jim and Bob will bring you some laughs until it starts getting repetitive, with this said, they do take a big part in the Single Player campaign mode which starts as a tutorial for the first couple of matches and then throws you right into a story mode.On average a match will take about 60 minutes from start to finish so make sure that you have plenty of time before starting a game.

												Plays even better than the old version.  Improvements:* Graphics!!!* % of success - great for new players and helps avoid misclick (not seeing a tackle zone/dodge)* in game UI just works like you would expect it to (no tutorial needed)* Campaign is much better. Nice surprising events during campaing games :-)* AI is at least somewhat better.* Cut scenes of hits and touchdowns are fun!One Area to work on: * Some navigation outside of game play is unintuitive. (It took me way to long that to join a league you don't click on the league which takes you inside the league but no join button inside, but have to click on the word join below the league pic.).* Screen freezes sometimes during campaign games. Takes a while to unfreeze.Overall, after having stopped playing for a long time, I'm getting addicted again!And not sure how or why, but IT'S EVEN MORE FUN (especially when buzzed on beer :-)Enjoy!

												Its Blood Bowl 1 with better graphics, but its less ""complete"" than Blood Bowl 1 was.  There are just a lot of little things that are lacking.  For example, there are no cheerleaders and no fans on the sidelines.  One of the new features is that you can build your own stadium, but the camera angles make it impossible to see if upgrading the stadium actually results in a visual change, and each race doesn't get their own unique stadium like in Blood Bowl 1.  There is also a feature where you can build addons to your stadium, but the overwhelming majority of them are things you would *never* build.  In fact, I can only think of three that you could ever want, and even then two of them you would only want as an elf team and the other as an orc or maybe dwarf team.The singleplayer experience is also lacking compared to Blood Bowl 1.  I liked how in Blood Bowl 1 you had the league system and there was a visual representation of progression for your team in terms of which league you were allowed to join.  Blood Bowl 2 also has a league system for single player, but its just a single league that seems to *sort of* scale with your team.  Plus there are no difficulty settings (at least that I could find).Oh, and there is a game breaking single player bug where the other team just passes its turn without doing anything that is quite frequent.And on the topic of bugs, the game is quite buggy.  Other than the afformentioned game ruining single player bug, a lot of them are just minor interface or visual bugs that self correct.  But its just annoying to have to deal with them in a $45 game.The game also feels like it was designed for a controller and the mouse/keyboard controls are fairly hamfisted.  Navigating the menus is more difficult than it should be, and I have a lot of instances of my players moving to the wrong square.  I'm not chalking that last one up to bugs though as, again, I just think its that the mouse/keyboard controls are bad and imprecise.  I think that maybe in a few years, once the bugs are fixed, the interface is cleaned up, and more races are added the game is probably worth buying during a steam sale.  But right now, unless you're a hardcore blood bowl fan, I would pass.			"

												Do you love to hate yourself for buying video games? Then Blood Bowl may just be for you.Blood Bowl is a game that was originally produced by Games Workshop in the 80's and uses a six-sided die for just about everything that is available in the game. This method for accomplishing tasks, such as throwing blocks, passing, catching, etc. has been transferred to the digital version of Blood Bowl and is fairly straight-forward about the chances you have of completing said action. While that might not sound too bad for anybody who has never played a dice game before, those who have can tell you that you must be prepared to roll poorly in every game you play. There are games that I have personally played where it feels like a 3+ on a six sided die feels impossible after you've failed to pick the ball up four times in a row with a free reroll... Such is the way the dice-games go. There are times where your team will be one Go-For-It away from a touchdown, and you'll roll a 1, get an armor break, roll max on his injury then die, then you will expend your apothecary for the match in order to re-roll his injory roll because he's a level 3 runner and he's worth keeping. Then you'll roll another double 6 on his injury roll and he'll die anyway.Does the game sound fun yet? Probably not. Funny? Probably.The game has cool and interesting mechanics to it, and all races and players can get skills when they level up, improving their value so that they contribute more to the team. As the members of your team level up, you will figure out how they work well together, and you will learn how to make niches for certain teams that will carry your team to victory. Unfortunately this is a double-edge sword, as this can sometimes create a dependence on certain players, and if they're down or injured it becomes more difficult to function without them. This becomes especially hard for you, the gamer, when you go up against a team that is meant to kill things. When you're sitting in your chair at the beginning of turn 4 of the first half and you're looking at a screen with two players dead, two permenantly injured, and two KO'd you'll be wondering why you bought this game-- I know I did.If there is anything that this game teaches and teaches well, it is Risk Management. In anything that you do with this game, you should balance the importance of the action with the risk that it will fail, and then prioritize your actions so that you can get as much done in a turn as possible. It probably sounds like hate this game-- That is not true. I've had a lot of fun with this game, though I've come to a conclusion based on my own experience that it's more fun to play with people you can chat with... Which will not be too terrribly often, apparently. Out of five games, I find that maybe one of those people are willing to chat about anything, really.I recommend this game with the thought that if you do purchase this game, get it on sale, as you will undoubtedly feel at some points that it is not worth full price. Along with that, you should play with the idea that literally anybody on your team can die at the drop of the hat. Additionally, you should also try to play this game with people that you know, who you can talk to, that you're okay with yelling at/getting yelled at... because it will happen. My god, it will happen.			"

												I've played a lot of Blood Bowl games, and while this is nearly the worst one at least it's not the very worst digital version. It is a bit better than the very original vanilla version of Blood Bowl (PC or Xbox) years ago. However, Chaos Edition BB1 is still much stronger.BB2 suffers from poor stability, a terrible UX, stripped down team lists, and frustrating decisions from Cyanide. It does look better than previous versions, but like Debbie in 10th grade just because she looks a little better doesn't make her any less of a soul-sucking disappointment. Stick with BBCE and you'll be much happier.			"

												It's turn 16 and we're down by one. I sit here caged in by the biggest and nastiest Ork-folk you ever did lay eyes on.We square up against the Dwarves and make ready for the final push. First I see Big Terry go down in a firestorm of fists and beard hair, quickly followed by Thalin the Arsechewer. Crabcake the Vile, the ever lovable Troll is knocked away from his position of protection by a squad of several Dwarves. Time stands still as the Dwarves lock their beady little eyes onto me, their hunger for the ball in my hands is almost palpable. The squad that toppled Crabcake come at me swinging once....twice...three times. I dance away form them all, my wiry little Goblin frame aiding me but for how long who can tell?I see the Dwarves array themselves in a defensive formation, enough to make even the biggest of Black Orks soil themselves in fear. To score the final touchdown to tie the game I will need to duck and weave into several centimetres of angry, bearded, Dwarves.I say a quick and possibly final prayer to Nuffle and I begin. Fists fly through the air but I dodge them, fluid as water. Victory is within my grasp now, I hear the sound of dice rolling in my mind as I take the final step across the line and score the touchdown. My team roars their approval and the announcers in their stand cry praise for my unexpected victory.For a single moment Ol' Rat-face the Goblin stands tallest amongst the Stonard Firearses.			"

So... lets go for a PLUS and MINUS observation to be as objective as you can.Plus:There is a story mode that is MORE OR LESS a big tutoriel for the game.Online matches.An IA that will ocasinaly be really smart about Probability crunching.One totally new race for bloodbowl fans to descover.Finelooking models.Allright animations.The game is updated from time to time.If you buy it you can get free access to future races.Jim and Bob are Back with a fairly high amount of commentaries for your games.Now... the Minus...There are a LOT of cult teams that are missing and NOT anounced, Halfling teams, goblin teams, Chaos dwarfs teams, regular elf teams, Vampire teams, Kemry teams, Slaan teams, amazones teams and even ogre teams... are nowere to be seen.There are a LOT of Race that are included into costy DLCs if you did NOT buy the game before they were added: Wood elves, Undeads, Norse, Necromantics, saurus... wich limits furthermore your gaming experiance.The Races included in the base game are the most basic and/or  uninteresting Ones: Humans, orcs, Dark elves, high elves, skaven, dwarves are basicaly what you are gonahave to play with.The game is costy as BALLS.There are a LOT of really experianced players online making newplayers The learning curve is really steep and the tutoriel won't help you in your first decision makings.There is only 4 stadiums in which you can play with 4 variants in each.I do recomand to take it... if and ONLY if there is a big promotion on the game... or that you are offered every bonus things for free... it really looks like a Beta game.

So it becomes a very interesting and complex game.It's easy to get the basics of the game and it will provide u with a lot of fun and of course a little bit of frustration. But if you keep in mind that it's only a game u should be totally fine if the RNG will sometimes not be on your side!I can absolutly recommend Blood Bowl 2 if u like  turn based strategy games with RNG and if u wanna try something unique.

Since all decisions are made through simulated dice rolls, it can be as merciless as any wargame/tabletop.That being said; if you can stomach a sometimes clunky interface and the notion that sometimes you just WON'T win some matches due to dice rolling, Blood Bowl 2 is a great game. There is something incredibly satisfying when you knock down an enemy player's unit and injure or kill them.			"

												A solid game, great gameplay, with some minor issues. Good base game with the option to buy dlc races. A must buy for any turn-based strategy fan whenever it is below 20 â¬/$ or whatever. Buying it now will grant you access to all future races released.Games tend to last around 1 hour (less if speedbowling), so it's a game that takes time.7.5/10 (With the chance to improve after new races are added or patches are rolled in)			"

												To costy for what it is, you'll have your fun with it the models are somewhat good looking. So... lets go for a PLUS and MINUS observation to be as objective as you can.Plus:There is a story mode that is MORE OR LESS a big tutoriel for the game.Online matches.An IA that will ocasinaly be really smart about Probability crunching.One totally new race for bloodbowl fans to descover.Finelooking models.Allright animations.The game is updated from time to time.If you buy it you can get free access to future races.Jim and Bob are Back with a fairly high amount of commentaries for your games.Now... the Minus...There are a LOT of cult teams that are missing and NOT anounced, Halfling teams, goblin teams, Chaos dwarfs teams, regular elf teams, Vampire teams, Kemry teams, Slaan teams, amazones teams and even ogre teams... are nowere to be seen.There are a LOT of Race that are included into costy DLCs if you did NOT buy the game before they were added: Wood elves, Undeads, Norse, Necromantics, saurus... wich limits furthermore your gaming experiance.The Races included in the base game are the most basic and/or  uninteresting Ones: Humans, orcs, Dark elves, high elves, skaven, dwarves are basicaly what you are gonahave to play with.The game is costy as BALLS.There are a LOT of really experianced players online making newplayers The learning curve is really steep and the tutoriel won't help you in your first decision makings.There is only 4 stadiums in which you can play with 4 variants in each.I do recomand to take it... if and ONLY if there is a big promotion on the game... or that you are offered every bonus things for free... it really looks like a Beta game.

												Do you love to hate yourself for buying video games? Then Blood Bowl may just be for you.Blood Bowl is a game that was originally produced by Games Workshop in the 80's and uses a six-sided die for just about everything that is available in the game. This method for accomplishing tasks, such as throwing blocks, passing, catching, etc. has been transferred to the digital version of Blood Bowl and is fairly straight-forward about the chances you have of completing said action. While that might not sound too bad for anybody who has never played a dice game before, those who have can tell you that you must be prepared to roll poorly in every game you play. There are games that I have personally played where it feels like a 3+ on a six sided die feels impossible after you've failed to pick the ball up four times in a row with a free reroll... Such is the way the dice-games go. There are times where your team will be one Go-For-It away from a touchdown, and you'll roll a 1, get an armor break, roll max on his injury then die, then you will expend your apothecary for the match in order to re-roll his injory roll because he's a level 3 runner and he's worth keeping. Then you'll roll another double 6 on his injury roll and he'll die anyway.Does the game sound fun yet? Probably not. Funny? Probably.The game has cool and interesting mechanics to it, and all races and players can get skills when they level up, improving their value so that they contribute more to the team. As the members of your team level up, you will figure out how they work well together, and you will learn how to make niches for certain teams that will carry your team to victory. Unfortunately this is a double-edge sword, as this can sometimes create a dependence on certain players, and if they're down or injured it becomes more difficult to function without them. This becomes especially hard for you, the gamer, when you go up against a team that is meant to kill things. When you're sitting in your chair at the beginning of turn 4 of the first half and you're looking at a screen with two players dead, two permenantly injured, and two KO'd you'll be wondering why you bought this game-- I know I did.If there is anything that this game teaches and teaches well, it is Risk Management. In anything that you do with this game, you should balance the importance of the action with the risk that it will fail, and then prioritize your actions so that you can get as much done in a turn as possible. It probably sounds like hate this game-- That is not true. I've had a lot of fun with this game, though I've come to a conclusion based on my own experience that it's more fun to play with people you can chat with... Which will not be too terrribly often, apparently. Out of five games, I find that maybe one of those people are willing to chat about anything, really.I recommend this game with the thought that if you do purchase this game, get it on sale, as you will undoubtedly feel at some points that it is not worth full price. Along with that, you should play with the idea that literally anybody on your team can die at the drop of the hat. Additionally, you should also try to play this game with people that you know, who you can talk to, that you're okay with yelling at/getting yelled at... because it will happen. My god, it will happen.			"

Trying to improve your team gets quite addictive.~ I just hope they dont milk it for DLC (lack of races & game modes right now)- The scripted single player campaign season is horrid -> lose a match = game over screen, when dice rolling plays a big part this is just frustrating.

												I understand there are lots of critisms out there for this game, and some of them are vaild, but when looking at all the factors involved in this, i honestly have nothing to complain about with Blood Bowl 2, its what you would expect from blood bowl, turn based violent sport with various teams and races that each play differently, and although we don't have all the teams from the tabletop or chaos edition, we have the key core teams that are the most popular and encapsulate the majority of the playable styles aside from some of the more...oddball teams, and considering the time and capital required for cyanide to make these teams its understandable we can't have them all right now, they simply don't have the time and money. The game looks wonderful, runs smoothly, as a far cleaner and easier to interpret UI than chaos edition. From the point of a veteran of Chaos Edition (and i mainly play Lizardmen, so this is a recommendation despite not having my favorate team) this game is fun as heck, but i can understand wanting to wait for more teams to come out, even though i personally think the current variety is enough to keep the game alive, and the core of what makes the game great is there, and it seems far friendlier to new players than previously, although i would suggest that, if you have friends that are experienced with blood bowl, you let them give you a little hand to get started. Other than that the game is a blast and im going to keep on playing!			"

												Disappointment... The game is a faithful adaptation to the board game but does not improve from BB1The good: graphics and animationsThe bad: UI is painful, in solo there is no possibility to save during a game (and if you quit because you don't have 1 hour to finish then you just forfeit), IA is poor and doesnt represent a challenge,  there is no real long term interest to play solo, RNG extremely suspicious from time to time, DLC fest if you want to have all the racesSo yes the game looks better than the first one but that's all for the improvements, there is still no real solo game where the only challenge will be how lucky you are with the dices, so unless you are planning to play with friends I don't recommand this one.

												I never played blood bowl before getting this game; so I have no experience with any other versions.This game is very fun. It's a turned based football/rugby strategy game. The teams seem pretty different; some teams are good at the game itself, like ball handling/passing/catching, some try to kill/injure people to take an advantage, and some are a mixture of both. I'm still new but there are a ton of talent points; so it looks like there is quite a bit of character customization. The game seems pretty deep; but it doesn't take too long to get the hang of the basics.The visuals are pretty amazing for a turn based strategy. I can't think of one that looks better. The art style is also really cool.The only thing I can really complain about is the camera, which you cannot spin. Also the games can last an hour if both people take their time; and luck plays a huge factor in the game. These arenât really bad things, but thing to be aware of.So far Iâm really liking this game, very fun 1v1 turn based strategy game.			"

												I can't recommend the game until they at least get some form of real matchmaking in place. It's entirely too frustrating to try and play a game with a new or new-ish team only to get matched with an opponent with 500+ more Team Value than myself. This has happened consistently, with one of my Chaos teams having gotten no less than 3 opponents with team values in the 1500-1850 range in a row. While I was sub 1300 for at least two of those.Game is fine if you've got a group of friends and do an in-house league where you start off on the same foot and keep relative pace with one another, but trying to play in any public league is maddening for the reason above. Once they fix that, I'll change to recommending the game as it's not a bad revised version thus far even if it has less overall content than BB1: Chaos Edition at the time of this writing. It shows promise, it just needs some kinks worked out. The most major of which to me is the matchmaking.			"

												I play mostly BB:CE, so i'm looking mostly at differences between the two versions. The new button layout, once you get used to it, is superior and actually makes sense now. Be careful switching between both versions; misclicks happen. I love the new stadium options, allowing you to customize your team's pitch. It reminds me of the special play cards in the TT game. I'm not as in love with the new graphics as the general opinion seems to be; there's a lot to like but not everything. The stadiums are pretty, but the new larger overlay is what you see most of the time, and that's the same for all pitches. The fans all have the same face. The uniforms look more similar to eachother, and as has been pointed out many times, do not change as a player advances. However, there are some real highlights. The new CW helmets are fantastic. The troll-slayer has a great, eager look to him when he moves. The troll's jaw is excellent. There are tons of these tiny nifty details. The GUI is better too, with clear and obvious choices on rerolls, apoth, bribe, and such. The on screen information during play is a weakness, as the skills are now icons and some of the team info is obscured. I like the new version and I hope they address some of the issues, which would seem to be easy fixes in most cases.			"

												Probably better to just use your money to buy blood bowl 1.  If the price on this comes down to $25 or so it'll be an ok purchase.  Updated graphics on this but it's the same dicey garbage it always was.  You'll find yourself highly annoyed by the AI's ability to micro the hell out of each and every single move.Edit:After my review I installed it again and played through to 75%.  You will find it highly annoying watching the dice roll against you in the single player campaign.  Again, I'd wait for a sale.  I think that people who enjoy this game have a high frustration tolerence - an admirable trait.  I don't have that.  I hate watching my best strategied get stifled by 'elven tap dancery'. .cant counter them either with the humans in the campaign on 1 blitz per turn.			"

												Despite it not being much different from the first incarnation of the series, I enjoyed this one, mostly because Blood Bowl is a great strategy/sports sim hybrid. It's very rewarding to grow and shape your team over time, and the randomness inherent in everything doesn't make you feel too badly when things go wrong.The two main improvements over the past version are the graphical improvements, which are mildly nice, and the single player story mode, which was a pleasant surprise. Fairly amusing story, mostly narrated by the announcers, with a lot of interesting quirks laid out in the majority of the matches to spice things up.I had been concerned over an apparent lack of modes, but even after finishing the campaign, the league options available for continued single player play are varied enough to let me develop a team long-term. You can never go wrong with a promotion/relegation system.The price to allow you to play as new races is clearly criminal at this point, but the fact that you can still compete against them dulls the pain slightly.

												Blood Bowl is an incredible game where skill takes center stage but is also blended with gratuitous amounts of chaos, death and luck. This makes it entertaining because you can improve, ignore people who say BB is not skill based, while at the same time the chaos will always keep the game fresh as you just never know what will happen.Cyanide's second implementation of the game is very solid. The graphics are wonderful and the UI is nice and clean. You may read about things that could be changed, however they are tweaks to an already great game.			"

												Update: - Cyanide's communication is still lacking as always - The game is still great after 200+ hoursIf there would be no prior games or the TT, i am pretty sure most peaple would love this if they like strategic, turnbased, boardgamelike games. But Cyanide angered the (hard-)core community by making unexplained changes. If you are new to the franchise, BB2 is simply great. If you know the TT u may rage cause they changed many minor and some arguably not minor things.Still staying with my opinion:Get it, it's a blast :)-------Hi everyone,Just to counteract some of the rage:This game works pretty well for me. As a Bloodbowl 1 player i know where some of the rage against Cyanide comes from, but Bloodbowl 2 has been a bug-free(1 crash being my own fault probably) and real enjoyable experience to me so far. (50+ Hours, multiplayer and campaign, multiple teams up to 1800).Cyanide stays true to 95% of the game, and i am absolutely fine with the remaining 5% changes.1  or 2 skills may need to be slightly adjusted to match the TT-originals synergies/side effects of skill combinations, But todays patch already adressed at least one of them.Short Version:Get it, it's a blast :)			"

												Blood bowl 2 was really hard to get into considering I had never played any of the previous games but I stayed determined to figure it out because I just love the warhammer universe and the art style that comes with it. It didn't take long to catch on to how the game is played and I have to say I am enjoying myself very much. I'm really sad to see all the negative reviews. I feel like most of them are coming from people who played the previous game. I'm getting alot of play time out of this so far and I'm certain I will get alot more out of it so I'm very happy with the amount of money I spent. TLDR:game is hard but extremely satisfying given the time to learn to play. Would highly recommend.			"

												Great game but the Team Packs are an expensive joke of a rip-off. Seriously?! Are you going to charge me almost the price of the entire game (and for more than I bought for when it was on sale) just so I can play a handful of more teams? Sorry, but a $50 game should probably have all these teams included from the start. Money -grab			"

												I absolutely love this game!!! Does it need work, yes. Until things get worked on some it may be wise to hold off purchasing for awhile, but I'm having a blast with it for now and future improvements will only add to the good things which are already in place. It's dfficult for me recommend a game which needs tweeking and more teams to someone who has never played Blood Bowl before, but I think anyone who has the Chaos Edition will find a helluva lot to like here already with better things on the horizon.

												Blood Bowl 2 has issues when compared to its predecessor, in a vacuum. It has 10 teams currently (Wood elves and Lizardmen just added) rather than 25, and it has a new price tag, of course, however, I feel this sells short what Blood Bowl 2 does well.The AI has been dramatically improved, which is not thrilling for those who play in human only leagues, but for those of us that play against the AI, this is a big deal. Gone are the days of the AI, as its first action of the turn, trying to dodge through 12 tackle zones and go for it twice as a dwarf. Instead, it seems to do its turn in priority order, from most likely to work to least likely, and it seems to avoid doing bizarre and silly things unlikely to have effect. As elves, it steps out of block zones, forcing you to blitz if you are going to hit it, just like a human would.Assuming the new races do not cost an arm and a leg, and come out at a fair clip, I think Blood Bowl 2 is going to be a great upgrade on its ancestor.

												Blood Bowl is one of those games which I've been close to buying on sale on numerous occasions in the past, as it has intrigued me since I was young.It is based on a reasonably complicated 30 year old board game of the same name, which is a Games Workshop property set in its fantasy universe. The entire single player campaign essentially serves as a thorough tutorial to introduce the player to the rules, whilst carrying a fairly barebones story with some occasional amusing game modifiers to keep things interesting (such as things crashing on to the pitch, star-players or other characters joining the fray, or adverse weather conditions).This means you come away from the campaign with the confidence to try out the competitive online features, although for me all it did was lessen the absolute thrashing I got when I tried my first PvP match.The only criticisms I have for Blood Bowl 2, is that it would have been great if each of the other races besides human (including the DLC teams) had their own mini-campaigns to introduce the player to their subtle differences. Otherwise, thoroughly recommended.			"

												I can understand the complaints of those unsastified with what Cyanide has released, but on a whole, I love this game. It's brutal, cunning, and brings out the inner nerd in us all watching an Elf leap over a Dwarf's head to score a touchdown. Like to pass and run? Then the Elves and Humans are for you. Prefer to sow the seeds of sorrow and despair? Chaos, Dwarves, and Lizardmen will leave your foe reeling in horror watching every one of his player suffer an injury or die.Of course features are lacking like player progression. My Chaos units would so much cooler with some extra spikes. Stat stracking is only based on team and not players, single player is average, and no where near the sheer number of teams available from BB:CE. Though all of this should be fixed in time. So for now, pick your second favorite team if yours isn't in and get to blitzing.			"

												First experience with video Blood Bowl, did not play 1. The game works exactly as intended, super fun AI games between those tabletop matches, plays great with a controller. More races would be nice, it's probably in the works, but the 8 races provided really cover most of the play styles. Friendly match with shared or two controllers is great for playing with a buddy and teaching someone how to play.BUT the textures bug out sometimes? (Shadows of helmets appearing when the helmet is off, block status symbols showing up over and over in a line.) The graphics aren't BAD but they aren't good either. Commentary and bowler audio gets old quick. This game isn't polished. Campaign is a joke, play solo-league for good AI play and team management.Overall recommend if what you want is the latest version of video Blood Bowl. If you want more races, I've heard good things about Blood Bowl 1 - Chaos Edition. Though I've heard the UI is rougher and it does not have native controller support. If you're unsure what Blood Bowl is, or aren't super excited to play it on a PC, I'd just wait the price out. It's hard to recommend the game at this price unless you really want to play.			"

												Let me start by saying my system exceeds all the recommended stats for this game. So you can imagine my surprise that in order to make the game stop crashing (well to be honest, the screen just goes black, but you can theoretically still play, you just can't see squat) I have to turn off the crowd and grass visualizations.And then there are the times the opponent times out their turn and... nothing. yup, nothing. Logic would dictate that my turn would follow theirs, but sadly, no.There are many other little annoying problems with this game, but the rest are fairly livable, but then why would you buy a game that runs like crap? Oh, and don't get me started on the really dumb ""new"" AI. Buy Blood Bowl Chaos Edition if you really want to play Blood Bowl. Wait until this pile of steaming Grobi droppings gets fixed. (Or more likely, seeing as it is Cyanide after all, the next version comes out. You know, Blood Bowl 2 The Pickpocket edition!)*Edit*I also just found out that in single player if you lose connection to the internet you lose the game you were just playing. Of course it doesn't disconnect you during the game, just after the game it says ""Trying to reconnect to the internet"" which I was connected to the internet (I'm not sure at what point I may have dc, but by the end of the game I was connected) and I waited 15 minutes of the game trying to reconnect without success. Another great idea by Cyanide (and yes I am aware it is not their original idea, but what a stupid idea)			"

												One word springs to mind with this game .... Rigged.   I know this is a RNG game,  but there just seem to be too many occurances of AI rigged rolls to be ignored.   Some players claim to have played through and never lost a game,  or conceded a point,  fair play to them.  However there are also a large number of players that like me are frustrated with failing every dodge or go-for it.  Failing to pick up the ball when you have a 80+% chance of picking it up.   While seeing an opponent who does not seem to be able to fail to dodge your tackled zones,  and gets a knock down on almost every block.   I got his game when it was reduced recently and I still feel like asking for my money back.The game itself looks good,  and runs smoothly however the game lacks any feel of a campaign.  The solo player campaign is a tutorial, which again seems to be rigged to make you lose by about the 4th match,  and the solo leagues are just multiplayer against an AI.  My advice would be to check Ebay for a copy of the original Bloodbowl board game,  get some mates round,  a few beers (age permitting) in, roll some real dice and play the game like it was meant to be played.    It was a brutal game,  but at least it was a fair brutal game.  Not one that seems to delight in throwing you to the ground then grinding your face in the turf with an ogre boot.			"

												Can't recommend this if you own Blood bowl chaos edition.All this game is at its core is a UI and graphics overhaul of the original with far less teams, less player customisation (no armour etc to buy on level up) and the same dull single player experience. I was hoping that in this game they would flesh out the single player league games but its still the same affair. This may have been made by a small studio but in my eyes they should have expanded on what the original offered, not made it smaller and prettier. Typical sports ""sequel"" that isnt value for money and offers virtually nothing over the original. "

												First time I'll leave a recommandation on Steam.Played countless hours on the board game, and on the precedent edition.I'm really ashamed to have supported this fraud with already enough time, and money.-Metronomic boredom. Here's what I keep in mind from the gameplay (still resonates in my ears) :""(...) Puf puf puf puf puf puf puf, huf.Puf puf.Puf puf puf, huf. (...)""Its goes on for more than an hour.Also, no pause (obviously), can't get away for a minute.Such irony for a turn-based game, game was judged already too slow to allow it to waste more time.-Marketing depht of cereal commercials.""Hey coaches ! Welcome to our wondeful user-friendly world, and please check-in with your credit card"".(check the Mighty Quest for Epic Loot for the exactly same approach, get the idea).I hadn't the patience to finish an entire game.I spent most the time looking in all the features, trying to find some customization that would allow me to immerse myself in some team. Well, everything is bland, and such an anemic content.Figured I can't play solo (no true compaign that is, and by this I mean : create a team, play matches, get experience, win cups. Silly me, such high expectations for Blood Bowl..).Learnt I could refound on Steam.Felt robbed and stupid when I saw that my playtime was beyond 2 hours.Joke's on me. Hopefully not on you still.			"

												If you are after a perfect game then this game is probably not for you, not sure I have ever found a game that isn't riddled with flaws from someones point of view.   Game is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination and sort of has a feel of being slightly rushed and incomplete at the moment.  It is a great deal of fun none the less and if like me you grew up playing blood bowl on the tabletop it still feels right.  I will say make sure your focus is multiplayer however as the single player is more than a little bobbins, but if you are a true tabletop gamer what the hell are you playing single player for.....have a word with yourself :P    Dice rolls are still frustrating as they were in BB1 but then as someone that once rolled 19 1's out of 24 dice for armour saves on a 2+ with real dice sometimes you just have to smile. The dice gods are fickle and all that jazz!I don't understand the rage about the races to be honest, the original blood bowl was released with 8 races and this is released with 8 races too with another 2 DLC races to be released soon.  Personally I have only ever played with Dark Elves, Chaos, Orcs and Undead since I was a kid so 3 out of 4 in the initial release I am happy with.  I would rather pay say a few quid for the DLC race I want rather than considerably more for a full expansion with 90% of the races I literally have no interest in.  Everyone will be different in this respect some people will want all the races because they feel incomplete otherwise.  I put that down to my background in the tabletop game, only ever brought, painted and played with teams I wanted to use, had no interest in owning every team, didn't have anywhere near enough money from school holiday jobs to afford them anyway.Would I recommend this game to everyone?  NOWould I recommend this to my friends that like me are tabletop gamers and love all this kind of stuff as fun and a bit of relaxation after work?  YES YES YES			"

												Want to play with Wood elves or Lizard men? You better pirate the game then! Because they are pre-order exclusives and not available to buy as DLC.I used to think that release day DLC was the worst business practice that drives people to piracy and kills the PC gaming industry, but now I think having exclusive pre order bonuses that's not even available as DLC is even worse. Piracy is not a criminal issue it is a service issue, is it really that hard for games companies to offer a better service than the pirate?! I would certainly don't mind throwing money at games companies if they can just get their act together.For the record, I did buy the game on steam, but I don't want to play multiplayer if I can't play my favourite team (Wood Elves). I would recommend any potential buyers to either wait to pick up this game at the christmas sales when it will be bundled with more playable races, or to pirate it to play in local leagues.			"

												I love(d) blood bowl,BB1 Chaos edition was the bomb! and maybe it still is...sorry BB2!  They did a Great job tho, the animations are fun to watch (a little repetitif, but fun), the factions are pretty well balanced (compared to BB1, Go halflings!), the UI is pleasant and last but not least jim johnson and bob bifford are back! but....It's still Bloodbowl, nothing has really changed...Don't know what else to expect tho, given the fact that BB was originally a boardgame.If cyanide doesnt whish tho innovate the gameplay, it will always just be a digitalized boardgame.Ever played monopoly on pc? Here are some extra personal cons.Dicerolls are frustrating! You can be the best tactician ever, but those 15% will get to you, every bloody time...I had the same problem when playing Xcom.I can endure losses, but after a while I get the feeling that ,all of my carefully chosen actions, have random outcomes, even if the chances are above 85%... that 15% you're ignoring? could be instant death, over and over, even when using rerolls...(I swear i almost transformed into the angry videogame nerd! you kno? the hulk among gamers? nvm...)Not enough factions!Where the halflings, khemri's, ogres, vampires, goblins, amazons at!? this is why BB1 is still the bomb!(I know they intergrated the khemri into one of the undead teams, khemri were OP anyway, but it still makes for one less team.)1Dlc/faction...Kashing!One of the things I love about the warhammer franchise is the amount of factions it has.I'm not against Dlc, as long as it makes the game ""live"" longer. Making a Dlc for every faction in the game doesnt contribute to it's lifespan... It only makes it overpriced.* If you wanne play this game while being low on cash, buy BB1 on sale, u wont miss much except for some faction balance and brutal animations. :) *			"

												This game has potential but there are a lot of missing or broken features, game breaking bugs, a poor UI both in game and out of game, no chat lobby, virtually non-existent league management, no player customization when they level up which means your stars look just like your rookies, no player statistics, just 3 Star Players available for each race instead of 6 for each race, and there are currently only 8 teams available instead of the full 23-25 races it should include and those additional races will be DLC that must be purchased if you want them.  It is really shocking how incompetent Cyanide/Focus are at adapting a board game.  Some of their balance changes like increasing the Orc Blitzer cost to 90k are also ridiculous and completely unnecessary.Essentially this game is a vastly inferior product to Blood Bowl; Chaos Edition the previous version of the game which has 23 races and more features.  How Cyanide released BB2 with so many critical features of the game completely missing is incredible.Check back in 6-9 months when more teams are available and see if they've added a lot of the features they should have had in game on release day.  The game will probably be on a 75% off sale by then and might be worth buying at that point.Edited Oct 7:  Cyanide/Focus just held an AMA on Reddit and unfortunately they validated the worst fears of those who were skeptical of Cyanide/Focus.  Most of the missing features are not coming due to cost restraints or in some cases conscious design decisions and the same is true for many of the broken features.  It's absurd but they claim it's too costly to do the art work to have player appearances change as they level up but they are fine with charging over 5 euros for the DLC on each new race.  The wood elf and lizardman stars have their heads cut and pasted onto the bodies of generic players of their respective races.  It's beyond belief.Edited 4/17/2016: Tomorrow will be 4 months after that Dec 18th announcement about the next four races and none of them are released yet and Cyanide has gone back into their shell of non-communication. Amazingly, the 5 minutes of work it'd take to correct the Orc roster still hasn't been done even though the game released over 6 months ago.I've about given up hope and that's sad because I love what this game could be if they'd just communicate and put some work in. This game deserves better than Cyanide/Focus as its developer.			"

												After playing eight or so hours of Blood Bowl 2, I was faced with nothing but losses for nothing but bad rolls. This game is nothing but luck based. You'd be better off going to a casino and spending 45 dollars of your hard-earned money. At least then you might get something out of it. The only reason I'd recommend this game is if you're already a hard-core Blood Bowl fan. It includes no races. The races are all extremely similar and it doesn't really make any difference which you pick. (Pick dwarves either way cause they always win.)			"

												The turn-based structure of Blood Bown 2 turns the sports genre on its head, as fast reflexes are no longer needed to win. Instead, the player with the most strategy will always come out the victor. You will have to choose your moves carefully as one failed maneuver (which is determined by a roll of dice) will end the turn.Every play made in Blood Bowl 2 will have a success rate attached to it like a roll of the dice. From simple maneuvers such as picking up the ball, to dodging tackles. Each position's stats will play a factor in this, so you donât want to pass the ball to your linemen. Making smart decisions first, and saving riskier ones for later in your turn will allow players to do the most in one sitting.The core gameplay is very complex, and youâll have to learn the strengths of every class thatâs in the game. So if you run straight into an online match youâll be extremely confused. Thankfully, Blood Bowl 2 has an excellent campaign mode that serves as a tutorial. By introducing gameplay mechanics slowly, and adding to them in each subsequent game, Blood Bowl 2 manages to teach new players how to play a very complex game.Blood Bowl 2 also features some hilarious commentary. Unlike most sports games that try their hardest to sound professional, Blood Bowl 2 matches are announced by an odd pairing of a vampire and an Orc thatâs a former player. Both will crack witty jokes constantly during games. The commentary ends up doing a great job of keep up the humor even at the most tense of times.All in all this is a great game if youre into turn based/strategy games.			"

												The uncertainty and severity in this game makes playing it exhilarating. I find many of the games tense like a good horror flick getting my adrenaline pumping, but football. It can be a frustrating game to learn as mistakes can be consequential and the dice can be very cruel. But the next turn everything can change. I've played Blood Bowl 1 a bit and also some previous versions. This one looks nicer obviously and I find using my Xbox360 controller and keyboard more convenient than keyboard mouse was. I can't wait for additional content. No real complaints other than I know I am going to beâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥off when my favorite players retire due to age. Having people die is one thing, but only having a limited number of games in each player like I've read seems like it will annoy me greatly. But we will see when I get there. Maybe I wont care. Depending on the team you choose there can be a large hump you may have to get over before your teams can win with any regularity and not have your players die. Dying all the time and losing can be frustrating so consider that when you choose who to play and how you want to play. Reading about the various teams and maybe watching some videos on YouTube or wherever may save you some stress. Great game, I very much recomend it! :)			"

												I can't speak for the single player experience, as I only play multiplayer.I started on Blood Bowl Chaos: Chaos Edition and this game is certainly a worthy successor in that regard.  The only hugely significant edge that Chaos edition has is that it has more races (specifically the most of the lower tier races).  While Blood Bowl 2 doesn't have all the races, it has most of the higher tier races and still enough variety that I haven't played through all of them yet myself.  Here are some of the things that I appreciate that may not be obvious from seeing the trailers and screenshots.1.  The ability to rewind, pause, and skip in replays.2.  When spectating a live game you don't need to fast forward to get to the current turn.3.  The ability reconnect in a game in the case of a crash or a disconnect.4.  Proper implementation of rolls like break tackle5.  Option to use of dodge when being pushed to the sideline (though not available in the case of One turn touchdowns)Some things that I would like to see.1.  Fend as an optional skill when blocked with frenzy so you can frenzy trap.2.  Grab as an optional skill so you can still surf with a grab player.3.  New DLC races on a more frequent basis.  The current rate they are getting released is fairly slow.			"

												Never played a Blood Bowl game before. Decided to give Blood Bowl 2 a try and have been very much hooked! A lot of fun. Love the fact that you build a team and also have the risk of losing your players forever. Love that permadeath feel.I did not think I was going to like it as much as I do but it has me hooked! Also finding a good League to join can make this game have a very similar feel to a MMORPG. You get attached to your players.Update 6/3/2016 : I will still leave it as a :thumbs up: as far as recommend this game but honestly I dont play the game nor do I want to at this point anymore. Its fun, great strategy but matches take toooooooooo damn LONG! I dont have all the time in the world to devote to each individual match and wish they would give us a timer choice of 1 minute each turn...			"

However the constant patches and communication increase has been so welcome that already some of my early concerns have been addressed. If you are a bloodbowl vet you may want to wait to purchase till your favorite teams are in as dlc. For anyone else if you like turn based strategy, have an attitude to win through losing, and don't mind a vocal community give it a shot.			"

												I'm a huge Blood Bowl fan and Blood Bowl 2 hit the mark for me. Blood Bowl 2 has made some serious improvements. The game has great and extremely hard hitting animations. Mixed with the sound design when a character moves down the feild you can hear their weight stomping down the field. When you hit a player down to the floor the new take down animations are just brutal. Every dice roll has you sitting forward in your seat praying to nuffle you will get the result you neeed. If a roll goes against you you pray again hoping that your player will at least still be breathing when he hits the floor. As players earn points and become better you grow increasingly attached to them but the threat of death in Blood Bowl could take them scream away at anytime. Theres a agood mix of strength and agility teams in the launch line up with 2 more coming very soon. I've been experimenting with a lot of them and I've having a great time doing it. Cannot wait for more teams and hopefully I'll see you in the multiplayer leagues!For anyone interested I will be doing regular videos on Blood Bowl 2 having a look at all teams and trying them out for your viewing pleasure. I tried the dwarfs out during the beta with episode one being available right here:

												Let's face it you probably watched the trailers and said this game looks awesome!The screenshots made you drool... Well the advertising is overselling as usual.What it doesn't show you is:- The impossible AI with no level selection. Yes, that means you will always be fighting an uphill battle even against the AI. The AI isn't that smart, but the developers made up for that by rigging their dice.- Brute force teams;  Dwarves, Lizardmen, Chaos, Orks, etc... are the only really playable teams. As long as you use the standard cage formation you will basically never lose the ball nor break through their cage. So much for creative strategy.  How to use: 1 cage per game, rinse and repeat as needed.- Elves and skaven are highly underpowered (This presents a problem if you are an Elf lover like myself). Maybe they don't have strength  but they can pass and run. However, what good is that when they can barely beat or avoid brute force lines and then run only half way (skaven; full way). - That all actions in the game are luck based (obviously as all actions are based on dice rolls) but certain basic actions you would assume a monkey could do are possible to fail (eg pick up a ball). I understand that this is a way the game progresses. However, when a guy fails to pick up a ball two turns in a row, it's not unfortunate, it's a form of mental disablity. (Note: not an actual issue, just something that ticks me off, and believe me you will be too)- The money system used to form teams is unfair to newer players. You are given just enough money to make a basic team and then plus a little extra to buy ""staff"".  However if you don't buy the better players to buy more staff you're at a disadvantage to almost all. If you buy better players and can't buy as much staff then you are a disadvantage to more experienced players (who usually have a lot). - Finally, minor side effect: The cutscenes that make you fall in love with the game in the ads will become redundant and tiresome fairly quickly (You can diable them, but its cutting out a great cinematic feature that you would like to watch but don't want to see repated five times a half). For more understanding of this watch and rewatch the trailer for an hour and that's just sums up one game.Finally, on a personal note I bought this game thinking it would be a fun strategy game I could play while relaxing after work/college. It's anything but relaxing, it is agravating as a any Call of Duty multiplayer. As I mentioned, it is luck based and when everything goes right, it feels great. But that's rare. Usually, you'll find yourself at the corner of Unlucky and Not Skilled Enough. When you are 5 steps from a touch down and that's when things go wrong, it's almost enough to just quit the game then and there. It's a fun game if you have patients for the BS you'll have to wade through to become good. I however, do not. If you decide to buy it, I wish you the best of luck.  Thank you for your time and I hope I was of some aid in your decision.			"

												I wrote this review, because I think current user rating (Mixed) is not fair. Blood Bowl itself is a table top game with really good gameplay mechanics, and Cyanide can't do much in regards of changing it. One of the common review response is that Blood Bowl 2 does not offer same feature-set as Blood Bowl 1. However, I would argue that it offers one really important thing - it's super user friendly for newcomers: - UI is better- Chance of success percentage is really helpful- Animation is superior (You can't dismiss fun of anticipation of injuring other players).- Tutorial is goodI'm not really experienced player, but Blood Bowl 2 helped me to understand the game rules better and it's really fun to watch. I even went back to Blood Bowl 1, and started to enjoy it even more. I found great player communities that organize regular competitions. Overall, it is really great experience that I have missed in computer games.Many BB1 veterans downvotes the game. But I would like to ask you to be patient, because BB2 actually helps our community to grow. I believe that Cyanide wanted to implement all the fancy features, but couldn't. They focused on making the game more approachable, and I praise them for it. And later more features will come.In conclusion, if you're a fan of turn-based game, sport games, tabletop games and fantasy, you will have great time with this game. Don't make poor reviews to scare you. The top poor reviewers spend more than 100 hours, and it says about something to me. Go watch some let's plays. Watch Crendorian Invitational. This game is great.			"

												Have to say I was very hesitante due to the fairly mixed reviews this game has recieved. Knowing Cyanide from their Cycling Manager I actually expected both positve and negative to be true.However, I found the positive much more true after about 30 hours of play. Yes, frustrations are real when dices do not go your way but I do feel that it goes both ways - often I pull off some miracle plays or the opponent is unlucky with a goal line fumble.The matches are really entertaining and the races have a lot of variations - Bashy teams being the most similar but with subtle and important nuances.

												THIS IS NOT A SPORTS GAMEIf you are buying BB2 thinking OMG a fast paced mix of American Football and AWESOME you are only half right.The game is slow and tactical (and a mix of American Football and AWESOME).  It's a turn based strategy game.You will rage at the game.  You will throw your keyboard/headphones/whatever is lying nearby.  You will curse the game and ragequit.  You will then be sucked back into the game to try another round.  It's not the rage caused by a bad/unfair game.  It is the rage caused when a strategy game doesn't go your way and you were oh so close to winning. If a turn based, tactical board game is your type of thing then I strongly recommend BB2.  It isn't perfect (the AI is lacklustre once you know the game) but it looks good, it runs well, it's fun and it's incredibly rewarding.Most of the negative reviews are because people want it to be a game that it's not.

												Honestly my reaction to this game is mixed. The game is fun and the feeling of yelling ""Elf â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t"" down the mic at your friend as you make three dodges and pick up the ball is amazing. On the reverse of this is that those things can happen to you and it can suck a little but you just got to remeber the good times.Yes. the menus could be streamlined for better use and yes the puchesses of races are annoying however the game is not bad. I haven't had any bugs happen since I started playing. The DLC races do cost a bit. However if you look at the cost of production I can compleatly understand why they are DLC. The Races take time and money to finish so they take a while to apply polish to. MY recommendation buy the game if you like what you see NOW. FUTURE CONTENT WILL BE IN THE FUTURE! So buy it then. Strongly reccomend the game especially with a friend to play against though  "

												As someone who has never played blood bowl this is fantastic! since i began playing this ive played over 100 hours here and about 20 on the DS version (which is old and has less content but its blood bowl on the go). My main issue is the matchmaking as there is no real big league for old teams so unless your playing with friends your gonna need to be using a team in a new teams only league. A work around would be to add a quick match where they try to match up someone with close team value regardless of whether the team is brand new. In short if you play old blood bowl then only get this cheap but i whole hartdly recommend this for new players, its my favourite turnbased game ever and i think im gonna go and buy the chaos edition of the original after a bit of research (to see if people still play online).My main gripe is the customization, people look way to similar and pitches all look the same except from 2 possible upgrades.EDIT:whilst people are still playing it is taking a excessive time to find a game due to the low player base and the ai are no match for anyone who understands the game, id recommend this game now only on the premise of either A: its really cheap or B: you have atleast 1 friend to play it with.

I never played the first game, so I can't really see most of the complaints people who were fans of the first seem to make for the most part. That said, some of the interfaces and stat pages could probably be improved and when playing in single player I really wish there was an option to accelerate the AI's turns. The pacing of the game can be a bit slow too, but I think that's more an issue with the source material than the video game adapation. All-in-all, I enjoy this game.			"

												The old reviews don't apply anymore, except for the races. Anyways the gaming experience is better in bb2 than in bb chaos edition. The UI is very userfriendly and slick. New races are quickly coming. If you buy the game now you get the next 3 DLC for free also.			"

												(Note: Though I am an amateur Games Workshop tabletop gamer, I haven't ever played tabletop Blood Bowl and I don't know if it is the same as this digital version. If not, I'd imagine it's pretty close!)Do you have a gambling problem? This is the game for you. If you want a game that you will always win, keep moving. If, however, you want a punishing title that will sometimes make you scream for bad dice rolls, you found it. I think that's the charm of Blood Bowl 2. You could be royally screwed over on a dice roll that there was no reason to lose, yet so could your opponent. This game sometimes makes losing both fun and hilarious!Blood Bowl 2 is a mashup between the Games Workshop high fantasy universe and American football. It is turn based and your turn continues until you are finished moving players or you make a mistake and one of your players goes down or misses a catch (a turnover.) Each of your players has stats that determine movement range, number of dice rolled when blocking, catching, etc. The system is perfectly balanced and easy to understand. I find it very simple to estimate odds on the fly. Want a football game where players can be injured or killed? You're looking at it! I once played a game where my opponent only had three or four players left (total is always 11 with reserves.) Best part about the injuries (or worst, depending on perspective) is that they can stick with your players permanently. Death is also permanent. It's not all bad, though, as your players level up and can pick new skills or stats. My favorite part of the game and absolutely crucial in multiplayer.Speaking of multiplayer, there are official and user-created leagues and I haven't once found myself unable to locate an opponent. Multiplayer makes this game one of my favorites and I highly recommend it, even to people not into sports. Single player campaign seems fun, though I was bored of playing humans so I haven't completed it. It does appear to be short, perhaps meant as a way for new players to quickly learn the game.I give this game a 9/10. I can't wait to see some new races added to the mix. I'm also looking forward to the opening of the trading markets, where you can put players on the market and I think purchase others. Great fun! I would like to also see more lines from the hilarious commentators. (Bonus points to the devs for the Doctor Who and Game of Thrones reference. LOL!) "

												I really enjoy the team customization aspects of this game. Maybe the negative results are coming from people who hoped for just more interactivity but it does what it does very well. If you liked XCOM for the team building and strategy you probably will like this. If you're more of a fast paced real time gamer then this probably isn't for you.			"

												It's a blast to play just as it was before. The rules are implamented better for the most part. Most of the bad reviews â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ about not having the style of campaign seen in the first game but you cand do that by making a league and filling it with bots. The new multiplayer league system is slicker than its ever been. The UI is great but does take a bit to get used to because everything is streamlined for the most part and sometimes its easy to over look info right in front of your nose. It has several teams right now with others to be added as DLC. We even have a team right now we didn't have before with the Britonians. As long as the other teams are reasonable priced this is looking to continue to be a fantastic game for some time to come. Can't wait to see leagues pop up on Twtch as well.			"

												I know the boardgame, but i've never played it or the first Blood Bowl, so I can't compare this version with the previous. It's not a problem for me the little number of teams in the base edition, becouse I find a sufficient variety of tactics.I like very much this adaptation of the boardgame, it's fun to play offline for training and it's awesome to play online with friends. It's a real drug for me!Nice graphic, nice gameplay, nice strategy game. I love it!In my opinion there are only three cons:- After some hours will be annoying to see all the action in slow motion... can you set an option to see only the slow motion for the injury, the ko and the stun?- The price of a single DLC is very high if we consider that will be at least 15 new races, I hope that will be some pack with 4-5 races in a single DLC at a reasonable price.- Why the hell you translate in all the major european languages... but not italian??? I hope that will be an upgrade with italian language.			"

												Very unique, strategic blend of American Football/Rugby with Warhammer/Fantasy. For a sports fan mixed with a bit of a tabletop/RPG geek like me, its perfect. Though it has a steep learning curve, there are plenty of resources available in game and externally to help out. Game is only going to get better when the rest of the races are added. Looking forward to what lies ahead, I think it will be much more successful than its predecessor. Definitley recommended.			"

												Bloodbowl 2 is a strong recreation of the Games Workshop game of the same name and seems to be perfectly fuctional, graphically majorly improved, and much more stable then its previous incarnations.Are there a few quibbles? Certainly, but the only major complaint I have is the lack of a couches lobby and even then it would simply be very nice to have. A sticking point might be that there are only 8 (9 with the pre-order bonus, however they are not yet released) in the base game, but it is a good selection with more coming via DLC which will allow coaches to pick which teams they want to play as without the rebuying fiasco of the previous edition. (Note- you can play *against* any team that your opponents have, you do not need the DLC teams to participate in leagues for example)One thing I really should note.  While BB2 does include a single player campain and the capacity to play single player vs the computer, this is not the focus of the game and it shows. While the AI is stronger then it was in BB1, it still has a hard time picking stratagies based on what turn it is. Bloodbowl is ment to be league experience vs other people.I have had a hell of a good time, even when I have had may teams collective face stomped in, Nuffel be prasied. "

												I'm writing this review because:A) I thoroughly enjoy this game.B) The graphics and animation are sooo much better than the first game.C) I think the current ""mixed"" review is defintiely unfair.The game's UI is vastly improved from the first game and it now acually gives you a percent chance on actions. Maybe that makes it ""more casual,"" but it's definitely more helpful. The grid on the field was removed until you move units, which makes the field look nicer, but it makes it a little harder to calculate movements (I don't really care/notice). The only thing that I don't like is that many races are missing and will most likely be DLC. I still recommend this game over the first BB simply for the improved graphics, UI and the percent chances.			"

												While Blood Bowl 2 might be my first Blood Bowl game, I can say that it really attracts new people such as myself due to the former game's graphics. The quality of life improvements made to Blood Bowl 2 (apart from some slight personal UI problems) and graphics upgrade compared to Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition makes it worth the purchase for me as a newcomer to the series.What people who put negative reviews on the game are mad about is the lack of teams, which i agree there are, but still enough to have a lot of fun and varied team play.Overall, it's a good game if you like tabletops, warhammer, or even just turn-based games, I recommend it.

Just because it's nothing in between...Well to start of with the positives, The game looks wonderful, feels wonderful, and they have done a lot of inprovements on their previus installments when it comes to UI and graphics...Atleast now you dont have to dig down in a 80 page long Blood bowl manual to eaven try to understand why you allways fail your dodges.... All Tackle zones are color marked, and it will show you a clear % risk of sucsess/Fail.Eaven me that played the previus installment (Never the tabletop though), and basicly learned it by reading up on it, really aprciate not having to bring pen and paper to play a computer game :DOn the Negative side as mentioned probably all over this page.... Half the game is missing.. ++ chaos Expantion, there is a wely limited number of teams to pick from at the moment, and you get really tired of playing agenst the same teams over and over.And sadly you dont really have to take many looks on the screenshots to understand that creating fully animated content for a bunch of teams will take a long time.... we got our 2 DLC's (They where actually finished before game release), but I dubht we will se a new one for a while, and just one more team wont have me playing for months....

												Ok, yes this game has only 8 teams, just like the original Cyanide Blood Bowl game which later got a free expansion of 1 team.Ok the game still has bugs -- minor, mostly non-game breaking bugs. The game offered DLCs for preorder, which are pushed back because of development time got extended -- and for all those pre-orders who doesn't like this, know well that you still have the DLC.What's with all the whining? Is this the 1970s where games where perfect -- spoilers: they got bugs too! And they won't be fixed at all.No releastic expectations, no basic understand of economy and romantilization of an industry always filled with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t, and this perfectly playable game is somehow all that's wrong with the gaming industry?No, it's a good game.

												Very fun game but missing some of the races of previous blood bowl (I guess it will be dlc or something? not sure...). Its basicly the same rules as blood bowl 1 except a lot of the game is made clearer with % chance of stuff showing up now and the campaign teaches you the basics pretty well. I would have to say BB2 is better then BB1 because of these improvements and if you havenet played blood bowl before and your looking for a turn based game with very indepth game play mechanics and tons of unique characters that all feel very different adding to the replayability then this is a great buy.Few warnings though, have already encounted several bugs, such as your formations wont save between games, I keep crashing on the same campaign mission and cant complete it (campaign is a small fraction of the game and mainly there to teach you though and has funny dialog), encounted invisable units making tracking them on the field kinda difficult and sometimes the events wont actually occur even if it says they have (gnome crashing onto field creating an outside the pitch zone didnt show up). People have also said that some of these buggs were a problem in beta so there is a chance they wont be patched out either, im not totaly sure.The multiplayer and solo leagues still are tons of fun though so still worth buying regardless of these problems if this is the type of game your looking for.

But if your OK with randomness then bb2 offers great stratagy gameplay, cool animations and fun commentators (they get a bit old after a while). Overall i recomend the game.

												Football. A contact sport that millions watch and love.Blood bowl. A murder sport that millions watch and love.The sequel to Cynanide's Blood Bowl adpation of the tabletop game of the same name.  Turn-based footbal with fantasy races as players for your team. Bashy Orcs. Agile Elves. Murder-filled Chaos abominations. Only a sample of the 7 playable races with the base game with currently two DLC races that for now were only available via pre-ordering the game. All races have their own style of playing the field and the ball. Do you want to bash and smash your way to victory? Murder the enemy team? Or just run circles around them? There's a race with your playstyle.The game has probably hands down the best tutorial for easing new players into the core game mechanics via the single player campaign. The UI has also seen an improved overhaul from the first game making it easier to understand the math behind the dice rolling the game does to determine failures and success. It also offers both solo and multiplayer play with custom teams with a leveling system to customize them to how you see fit. Join a league and smash your way to the top.Blood bowl does have a steep learning curve. Sure the tutorial is great at introducing all the things you need to know on how to play but learning the rest will come from practice and losing. You will lose games, players, have injuries but it's all a part of the process and makes for interesting conditions for playing each match. So read up on forums and the such for basic tactics used in the game or for team builds.RNG is a big factor in the game so if you hate it, this game isn't for you.A con of the current game is having DLC already when the races should have been included into the base game, not having even half the race roster the first had.

												Now, I wasn't going to buy this game based on some of the negative reviews, however I loved and played BB1 and Chaos Edition so much I felt I owed it to the game to at least give it a try. I'll try and make my review unbias, however I do enjoy the game so far, so that's going to show through.I've played around 3 matches now, and I can say I'm really impressed.For anyone concerned that there may not be a way to do Single player tournaments, well let me put your mind at ease, as there is. You can build a team, and then choose to do a whole tournament vs AI instead of online.With that out of the way, I was a much happier player! I spent most of my time in Blood Bowl 1 just building teams and doing tournaments, and here you can do the same thing.Also, once you actually play it, you can see a lot of work has gone into it. Sure, there are only 8 teams + the pre-order teams, however there has been a lot of effort put into those teams, and we all know more will be released.The game as it stands is very playable, and you can turn the commentators off. (the subtitles stay on, but they'll no doubt put in a fix for that)So here's a quick layout for you to make up your own mindPros - The UI is modern and simple. It takes some getting used to but it's cleaner and I found it uncluttered and easy to use.-The graphics are better (of course) but they have really put a lot of love into this game-The block animations are great, I love them, if you don't you can turn them off... but I'll never get sick of my Dark Elves kicking over an opposition!-It's still Blood Bowl, the rules are the same, they have stayed true, they haven't tried to make a blitz mode which for me is a pro, instead they have put all their effort into making a working tournament system, that you can either play online or solo. It has a home stadium you can sink spare gold into, it has an coach experience system, it feels like there are a lot of other ways to spend your cash-The campaign is only Humans, I don't like humans, but the campaign in the last was only humans or orcs, and apparently they have put in a LOT of extras into it to make it an interesting story, so I'll try it, but I can't comment on it as I haven't yet. I think it's a pro that they didn't just leave it as tournament play, they actually put in some effort here!-The AI is smarter... definitely smarter... which makes it a lot more dangerousAverage--The game takes a little longer, I am sure I could trim it by chopping back animations and gaining more experience on the UI, but the old Blood Bowl took around 20 mins a match, which was nice.-Since the tournament is online or solo, it saves your team after a match. This stops you from loading when you lose a player. I love and hate this feature, as it could break your team to lose your star player, but then... it's blood bowl... players die... So as long as you can come to terms with this, then you'll be fine. I'm still coming to terms with it, but it's not a con.-The team count. Who cares? Some obviously do. This in no way affected my decision to purchase this game. I have a lot of teams I enjoy playing, some are here, some aren't. It hasn't bothered me.Cons -To be completely honest, I bought it knowing it was blood bowl, and it is. It's better than the last in a lot of ways, it's worse in few. I don't mind the crowd is all human. The crowd in the last game was barely rendered... -The cheerleaders are only human, this doesn't affect gameplay...  but I'll list it here, it's something they will add in.That's about it. I just wanted to put in a review that assures people they can spend hours on the single player, just like the last game, and still have team progression. The price point is pretty good for a game I know I'll spend 100+ hours playing...For those that aren't buying it due to the number of teams playable, well, that's a shame, but they will release more. I can't comment on the Multi-player or campaign as I haven't tried them yet			"

												First of all got a lot of people complaining about small things which generally I take as the game is good.  If the biggest complaints are things that are going to be added and improve then it is on the right track.  The game is very solid a lot of haters just arent that great at the game loose a few times then drop the game saying its bad.To those people saying there isnt any info you should learn to google the in game tutorial is actually the campaign mode and the game is fully explained there. For advanced tactics there arer dozens of blood bowl strategy guides on literally all of the things you would want to know.There is nothing like the risk management you learn from this game I went from  loosing every game and getting awesome ego boosters through chat like ""Easiest td ever!""  to straight dominating the pitch.Pros-Beautiful graphics-Fast matching-Great fun upgrading both team and characters-Engaging story in campaign-Tons of leaguesCons-Still awaiting some features-Character level up doesnt change appearance (Mutations do)All in all I believe the game is an upgrade to its previous versions its just the complaints are it didnt start with the dozens of races the previous games did but it has just released and its good to learn teams at a slower pace so your not overwhelmed as a new player.9/10 would fumble on the 1 yard line on a GFI again!

												If you like turn based games, gridiron, violence and team management, get this game you will more then likely enjoy it.I give this game a thumbs, up its a good solid game and it provides hours of fun.May only have around 20 hours clocked up but ive only had it 3 days at the time of writing.Is it worth full price ?  That is entirly up to the individual, there are a lot of people who feel this game is a cash grab. I personaly feel that on its release the price was a bit high but where the price settled is a good price.Reason for purchasing the game.I\'m new to bloodbowl and I found playing the first game not easy to learn and the graphics were pretty poor, blood bowl 2\'s UI is easy to understand, and the models and characters are better then anything id be able to paint myself and look awesome.I\'d like to remark on some of the more negative posts.Campaign just a tutorial:  This is true, but if any of the people complaining about this had played for more then 40 mins they would have found at match 9 thats %48 campaign completion its pretty much a normal solo league, with a story and the training wheels are fully off.Campaign only for one race: From memory campaign in blood bowl 1 was effectivly this games solo league so I dont see where the probem is.DLC is a cash grab: I don\'t see it this way, we get 8 races that are well fleshed out for a good price. $4 - $10 for a DLC team depending on what part of the world you live in, is a good price. Look at it this way you would never be able to buy and paint a blood bowl tabletop team for $10, just saying.Graphics arent any better then the original:The people who say this must be running the game on toasters, the game has been made on a brand new engine and is immensly better, easiest way to see this is pretty much looking at the steam pages for both.Lesser issue, responding to artificial coach leveling:This is why there will never be a local hotseat league mode with experiance for your coach, too many people would just cheat to level up their coach. a.k.a Artificial leveling making teams that only one person plays to just roll over and lose to your main team thus getting better exp for your coach.

												Blood Bowl 2 by Cyanide should not be anyone's first experience with Blood Bowl. Blood Bowl has been around since 1986 and its third edition won an Origin Award for best miniatures rules in 1994. I will say the bulk of the rules work after Death Zone was done by amateurs and not properly play tested.  I have been playing since second edition but quickly adopted the third edition upon its release. I have also successfully studied probability, statistics, logic, and programming at the collegiate level. I apply statistics, calculus level math, and light computer programming in my daily job.The probability, logic, and programming of BB2 are all broken. They have failed to monetize it correctly, missing out on a substantial sum,  and instead are gouging the few players they have on DLC that should be included. They fail to police their online play; resulting in free range for cheats and hacks. They also ignore their own support emails. The community is largely apathetic to these issues and typically respond with the chorus of, âfind a private league.â Either this or they openly attack the person broaching the issue with nitpicks or failed math. Please read on statistical sample size determination, standard deviation, and confidence interval, donât stop with high school probability. It shows a failure of opportunity.The only people who should purchase this game are people who truly understand what Blood Bowl is and are unable to sit across a board with friends. If you know what Blood Bowl is and your work, life, gaming balance is such that you cannot play in person; buy BB2. Keeping it alive may convince a good publisher to pick up the torch and do it right. A person who has never had the fun of rolling the block dice, please avoid for your own good.			"

												so far very good play similar to board game and a few nods to previous pc bb games.  Big diffrence is that when you fail a block on offence (in campaign)  you do no turn it over.  Not sure if that will change later but at this point this mechanic gives a leg up to the brutal teams bent on kill/maining.			"

												This is one damn fun game, especially with a group of your own mates to  smash into bloody bits  play against and overall the game plays well although there are a few issues that still need to be resolved.Typical negative issues are the fact that a lot of the models look very much alike and this problem is compounded by not being able to place markets on players to help identify those players with special skills.  Other issues such as the multiplayer camera not staying in one spot in the other players turn as it tracks what the other coach is clicking on.  This makes it hard at times to examine enemy players and see what skills they have.  Maybe it's just me but I end up wasting too much time trying to scan players players and not enough hurrying my turn.That aside, the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is smooth, the combat is real and the gameplay is great.This game is a MUST buy if you enjoy mutiplayer, turn based or american football type games with fantasy races and violence.F0x			"

												As per most of the Specialist games produced. Blood bowl 2 is an ""OK"" game if you havent played blood bowl on the tabletop, but if you do like blood bowl in general you will find great satisfaction with this game (you can have fun with this game even if you dont play the tabletop, but us model painters and playing-field designers love the game to begin with).The blood bowl games adhere to the classic rules so strictly itÂ´s almost refreshing, and blood bowl 2, though a bit ""preemium"" in terms of pricing, will not fail to impress.Bynote, this game involves strategy, team management and a good bit of luck. If you like any game where you need to take a team of units into a battle, and the postgame of experience awards and equipment is important (Such as for example X-Com, loads of rougelikes, RPG's etc) you may find yourself liking Blood bowl more than you though you would.

												I figured I would add my opinion of the game since I am seeing a lot of negative reviews that I feel don't do justice to the game. I am fairly new to Blood Bowl, I remember seing it around but I never got around to getting into it until Blood Bowl 2 came out. I first started playing on the PS4 but switched to the Mac version after it was available.The switch did come with a couple hiccups with the screen resolution and the chat window that were addressed in patches. I find that there is a fairly active community that surrounds the game and I have found the most fun when playing in custom leagues. Plenty of teams from the original roster are missing and the developers are in the process of adding them. It is taking longer than we players of the game would like but it is an ongoing process and it does not make the game any less enjoyable, it just limits the variety of teams but there is still considerable diversity.The game is very tactical and it definitely has a learning curve which can be frustrating to some players. However, if you have the interest and the patience to learn the game you will be rewarded with enjoyable strategy, deep tactics and punishing chance. Either the tutorial campaign or reading up in the rules and watching streames is definitely recommended for new players because otherwise you will not undertand why something is happening the way it is.You will cheer and celebrate when things work out and you will most likely curse at your screen when they don't. Things don't always work out in your favor even if you think that they should, such is the way of Blood Bowl. All the chance in the game revolves around risk mitigation and taking a decision on when to take a risk and how much of a risk to take. Whether it works out or not it all depends on chance. If you play with the sole intent of winning then the game will test your patience. However if you play it as a team-building, tactical RP where anything can happen to derail your plans then you will get more mileage out of it.			"

												The game is graphically a step higher than its predecessor, although it still lacks many races the BB1 Legendary Edition had given and that will probably be delivered as DLC. Aside from a few bugs that are being ironed out at the time of this short review, and that do not really affect the quality of the gaming experience, multiplayer is as fun as it can be (and as it has always been), while single player is totally useless because the AI blatantly cheats on dice.

												I personally hated the campaign  and I belive that you should not play the campaign, it's very boring and you finish it with a bitter taste in your mouth, if you ever get that far. I would recommend just playing it multiplayer in leauges cause thats were all the fun is and it is a great barrel full of fun, not even a barrel a winestorage cellar of fun.But as wines go, there are bad ones and sometimes when your favorite player dies to an elf with 1 str you will hate everything and everyone around you. But if you pull through that phase of intense hate you will find the joy once again in the form of, maybe your blitzer makeing an awsome tackle and injuring the ball-carrier, or throwing your goblin into the endsone with your Troll, any rolls that might have seen foolish or far fetched that turn into a solid goldbrick.There are, in conclusion more good wines than bad ones and I recommend this game very strongly.

												I have played the first editions of the game and i am a huge supporter, so i immediately bought this one when it came out. I have read a lot of reviews here and this is my view about the game. Pro's- Better graphics (personally i do not care too much about graphics, however having improved graphics and annimations helps)- The commentating has been improved.- More league types in solo mode (custom league is an improvement).Negatives- The game is not cheap and considering that it is likely going to have several DLC attached, we will probably end up paying a good 100-150$ in the end.- In regards to the fewer races (which is a big debating point), some people are forgetting that the previous versions also came with fewer races. I would say that this is not a problem, the problem is that they will probably charge us a hefty fee for each one. The game is not cheap as it is, so this will make this game extremely expensive.- Blitz mode is out! You used to be able to play the game in real time, which is not the main format to the game, but for people which prefered real time, they now have lost the type of game they liked most.- Overall this game has very little innovation added to it. Basically it is the same game as before, just it looks better and has fewer races. Online mode is improved, but overall it is the same game.- There is no save option during the games. Considering they take a while to complete, i have no idea why that option is not out there. It used to be there.- The gameplay is very slow. I would love an option where i could quicksim the opposition moves in solo mode. Staring at the screen for 2-3 minutes till the computer plays pretty much sucks, you can remove the annimations, which helps, but still, way too much waiting around. What i would have liked to see- A LOT more stats. The history section is very limited. There should be a lot more added to beef that section up.- Not much in terms of customization. I mean why is there no editor? Maybe i want to make a custom team or customize my players or opponents. I know that is not part of the original game, but i do not see why the developers did not add that option out there. I mean, i cannot even custom pick my own opponents in the solo leagues. I have to random pick which type of teams will be included in my leagues.- Why is there no hotseat co-op mode! I mean that would be an awesome option considering how few games use co-op these days on the PC.Overall?If you have never played this game, you will love it if you like turn based sports games. There is not much which compares to this on the market. To a new player, this looks like a more polished and improved version, with the better graphics, annimations, commentary and online mode. To a true fan of the series though, losing Blitz mode, losing 75% of the races in exchange for the better graphics (which get repetitive very early in a game like this), could be a serious drawback. I gave the game a recommended, mainly because this is an awesome game, just i feel that considering they had 6 years to make a new version, they could have added more to it, instead of removing what used to be there and charging us for everything.

												The best iteration of the franchise yet, without a doubt, but graphics aside, the improvements are incremental. The UI is more intuitive and clear than any previous Blood Bowl game, and the Tutorial/Campaign will actually gradually teach you how to play, by introducing rules one by one, rather than tell you to go read the rulebook.Online matches work well, and turns are (by default) timed at 2 minutes each, so a match will not take more than an about an hour.Player created leagues, persistent team improvements, injuries and deaths, as well as the transfer market, could make for a fun meta-game, but it's early days yet.If you've ever played and enjoyed Blood Bowl, digitally or otherwise, you will probably not regret picking this up, despite its steep price tag. If you haven't, and are unsure if it's worth the price of admission for you, I would recommend picking up Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition at a discount first, though you will have to make more of an effort to learn the rules of the game there yourself.

												So this game is a thing. Much like the first, if you don't like turn based strategy, it's probably not for you. Regardless, Cyanide really stepped up on this one, taking what we loved from the first Blood Bowl and fixing most of what we didn't (at leas as far as they could within the context of the game). A solid tutorial in the form of the first few games in Campaign mode spoon-feeds what could have been an overwhelming onslaught of rules, mechanics and fluff. You don't have to be a fan of Games Workshop or Warhammer (I wasn't when I first started) or sports (in some cases, you almost wouldn't want to be) to really get into it. Overall it's fun, quirky, and more than a little infuriating at times. Now, repeat after me...O mighty Nuffle, Lord of the Blood Bowl,Please see fit to grace me with 2-die blocks,Guide me as I charge forth into Blitzes,And please, O please, don't kill my runner on his oh-so-important Go For It roll that we desperately need to score that last Touchdown to secure the win.

Online BB1 was dead.Change, Each edition of BB has changed, sometimes for good sometimes for bad.Now the factsPro'sBetter graphicsEasier to make 1 off friendly matches without needing to join auld league and have farmers try and trick youInterface takes some time to get use to but in the long run i think will be betterPlayers on teams have more customize options that beforeAgeing is great ideaStadiumsPlayer market placeConsInterface is clunky atm and setting up to kick or receive you can run out of timeHard to tell who or what your facingPlayers skills require you to click on a player thus making it the next option to be used, the old way of holding your mouse over a player was betterCan't review a team before the match to tell if players have niggles or suchLess voice acting, sure new lines but why didn't you add to the BB1 lines instead of completeling replacing, bad idea, really bad ideaNo extended inducments i can tell off.No information on exactly how stadiums work for you and now i've got my 2nd upgrade and 1 enhancement i can't work out how to get a 2nd enhancementFor the time between games i was disappointed pre order bonus teams not in there from day 1.No DLC teams to buy yet makes the 8 team pool small. I accept DLC teams but how long do they expect people to wait when you got 23 teams in BB1, For the love of Nuffle i can't understand why at least 16 teams wheren't made for the release even if 8 of them where DLCSo yes there is a lot of cons but once the player base finds out the information on stadiums better, the extra teams get added i think BB2 willbe better.So do i recommend it?Yes if your a BB fanYes if u want changeYes if you want to keep playing BB once the BB1 servers are taken down, which you know they will be doing in under 6 monthsYes if you can get it half priceYes if you want a new style to playing since gridning 1-0 wins with ageing is a fast way to watch your team never level up before it retires.No if you are having a nerd rage over the number of teams,No if you play only high av teams who never take injuries as ageing will make you cryNo if your a cheap skate who expects every team to be in the game for less than half price.

												The most painfully RNG dominated game on the planet.  The concept for Blood Bowl is awesome, but when the best strategy is to try to do nothing so you dont have to roll the dice and have a chance to get screwed something is wrong.			"

												I am absolutely loving this game. I have not played Blood Bowl in any form before. The base price was a bit steep for me but on sale it was worth it.Pros: excellent turn-based, tactical gameplay (based one a board game), good graphics and balanced variety in teams.Cons: high price, one game takes about an hour or more and can be tiring when starting up, and some may not like the fantasy setting with orcs, elves, dwarves etc. (which I do not mind btw).Recommended if you like tactical, turn-based ""American football"" of some  sorts.

												To Long Didnt Watch: Great for new players and those who have never played bloodbowl before. A bit dissapointing for fans of the original game or hard core players of the table top minitures game. Blood Bowl 2 features water down rules which significant effect the risk management decisions, to the point of near elimination. I recommend caution, for fans of the series, but new players should find it much easier to pick up and play with the simplified rules.Plus the tutorial really holds your hand. (Yes you have to go through the hand holding if you have played 100+ games of bloodbowl and could write the rulebook from memory)P.S. You also have to play as humans, which sucks if you dont usually play as humans.

												I have mixed feeling about this game. After about 12 hours of playing the campaign, studying strats and starting team builds, I went multiplayer and got handily taken apart. Most of my opponents were at least a few hundred points higher level. In my experience, considering how long the games run (about an hour) the game does a poor job of making you feel like you are actually having fun or working towards something. That being said, I think particularly intelligent people or people who are talented at strategy games may find this game quite fun. In that sense it's very niche.Not sure whether I would recommend this to my friends or gamer coworkers. I'm just not sure they would find it fun.			"

												Join our 1 min league: Think Fast 1 Min.Excellent game, lots of fun, big learning curve. Definitely worth giving a shot too. This game has high replay value already for the price. Great community.This is the type of game where the training/campaign doesn't get your very far in the beginning. You need to dive in and lose a few games to get the hang of it. Thankfully the community is full of support and newbie tips. I recommend checking out cknoor and crendor on twitch and youtube for tips and tricks.Cknoor's steam community has helped me a ton on team builds.I don't have many played hours yet, but i'm excited and enjoy this game a lot. When i'm not studying i'm watching live streams on twitch while i'm at work or relaxing between class.I plan to update after more played hours.			"

												The game is more luck based than anything else. The only strategy comes from trying to minimize the amount of rolls you do. The game also seems to randomly pick someone at the start of the match and give them all the bad rolls which leads to some very frustrating instances where you are forced to lose to others. It can be fun occassionaly but the game is mostly just frustrating.			"

												I really wanted to be able to write a positive review about this game but I can't. The short version of what could be a long review is that the game is fun, but it is completely lacking in long term playability due to the multiplayer matchmaking system being absolutely horrid. This game is not fun for more than a few matches against the AI. If there was a human element, it would be far more enjoyable but I refuse to sit and wait in a queue for 10 minutes to play one game that the opponent will drop out of 75% of the time after 5 minutes.

												A great game for those that love turn baased strategy games. Would definitly reccomend to new comers in the series. Most of the negative reviews seem to be from veterans of the series who are upset by the lack of teams currently available, or minor things like your players' armor doesn't change as you level up, but what these players miss is that Blood Bowl 2 is a newly released game that will be kept fresh with patches, updates and expansions that will deal with their complaints and add much more. As a new comer to the series who hasn't been ""spoiled"" by the first Blood Bowl game I must say that this game went far beyond all my expectations and I would highly reccomend it to someone wanting to get into the series over Blood Bowl Chaos Edition for the simple reason that there will be plenty of new content coming out allowing the game to expand and evolve while it has been announced that the original game will no longer be recieving updates.TL:DR Newcomers buy this, returning players maybe stick with Chaos Edition for now, but before you know it Blood Bowl 2 will have more content than Chaos Edition and you'll have to move on up anyway.

												The campaign is alright... frustrating but fair....The multiplayer is complete garbage at low levels, ALL of my games have been ended by forfeit.Strategy on offense is the same with every race, make a box and push until you break through or push through enough to handoff. The outcome is entirely dependent on RNG and who has more rerolls because the strategy is so stagnant.Some games start with random events that effect the initial play. Once I had 6 players stunned on the field before kickoff and my opponent had only 1 stunned.If you enjoy the card game War, where the strategy is always the same, the outcome is dependent on luck and randomly someone gets punched in the face for no reason, then this is the game for you!

The gameplay is frustrating and gratifying in almost equal measures.  If you like dice based game this is worth a shot, if you enjoyed the table top then you will love this. Some of the animations currently are a little glitchy but these are few and far between.Especially if the game comes on sale you should pick it up.			"

												Bloodbowl 2 offers more as I expected. The graphics are great and the slow motion punches are great to watch. There are some minor roster adaptions, making the Humans almost above average. Cash can be used to add to your inducements so you can buy juicy Starplayers ( only 2 allowed each match ). Ageing makes that even the best build teams have to face retirement of players someday. It's surpassing BB1 by a landslide. Of course does it take some time to get used to the new controls. For that there is the Campaign, no spoilers here, but it's hilarious. So I am a fan.			"

												I used to play blood bowl back when i was a kid, and once blood bowl 2 showed up in my steam feed i had to give it a go. Now i'm in no way a hardcore blood bowl fan, in fact i had a hard time even remembering the rules. But blood bowl 2 turned out to be just the thing i needed, its easy to get into, the graphics makes it very enjoyable to wacth while you are learning and getting yourâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥kicked, and if you do need a hand picking up the finer details there is alot of help out there on youtube and forums, Sheepdog's youtube is a great place to start  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRu57V-oKAkQs4fx76dzIkwNow i think to enjoy blood bowl in the right way you have to do more than just play it, you have to talk to people. Make friends, laugh at you own stupid elf team failing to pick up the ball 7 times in a row, get invited to fun little leagues where you have to agree with you opponent when to play. Don't be afraide to just start out in multiplayer and ask for help, even if most players will see you as an easy win most of them will help you and often tell you what you could do better.Now there are some bad things about the game and some things that sounds worse then they are.The bad:-There are some bugs! most of them are not game breaking but they are annoying as â¥â¥â¥â¥, alot of them are not that obvious until you start trying fancy tactics and they consists mostly of the player not being able to choose when to use certain skills. ( note that this may be intentional and therefor will not be fixed)-Cyanide studios are terrible at communicating-There are only 10 teams are of right now, but more will come as dlc (tho we have no idear when due to the above)-Hardcore players have ALOT of other issues with the game, because bloodbowl one had alot more to offer in terms of teams and customization and because they hate the rules Cyanide changed in this version of the game. Now i understand them, its annoying when some one makes a 2.0 version of something but it feels like a 0.5 version, but as a new player with nothing to expect i love this game! Now a few things that sounds worse then they are:Chaos is not OP, if you are tired of high team value kill teams, make sure to keep you TV low and laugh at them. If you want to play at high TV make a team who's main job is to foul theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥out of chaos teams (armor dosen't matter when 6 dwarfs jump on a guy lying down.You players die and your teams fail. Accept it, laugh at it, its called bloody Blood Bowl. When with stupidly bad odds against a team with 1000 more TV than you don't give up, used the stupid petty cash, steal his rerolls, buy star players who you don't have to care if lives or dies, and last but not least belive in Nuffle. You agility 1 saurus can surely dodge twice pick up the ball and sprint for the touchdown line, its unlikely that it will work, but when it does you will be laughing youâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥off, and hopefully so will your opponent.

												This game is pretty good in my opinion.              UI:  The UI is far easier to understand than the original bloodbowl with the percentage to dodge being displayed as you click as well as the other percentages. Actually playing the game is better than the original as you can cancel a selection with right click making selection, delselection and moving player a lot easier. Hitting control either twice or three times displays a nice grid that is easier to understand than the original as well as displaying the skills that the players have making it more simple to setup your team against the other team.            Game Modes(besides multiplayer):   In terms of the game modes there is campaign which while it is a glorified tutorial that drags on does help newer player like myself into the game, they might want to add a fully fleshed out story mode like they did with blood bowl 1 as many people have complained about. The AI knows what it's doing people would stop complaining the AI knows how to play the game since they know how to cage and get the ball and what not. The friendly matches against AI or a friend are good for testing out your teams. The spectator mode can be a bit clunky  but it works so you can view your matches with all of nuffle's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t thrown in there.             Multiplayer:     The way you play the multiplayer is by entering a league then playing through the season in that league(although some leagues don't really have seasons it's just kind of playing against other people) some of which go into elimination stages making things very interesting to see who will win. There are other leagues such as the official bloodbowl  league in which you just play against a random opponent when you want to which is where i mostly delve into. Team building is simple enough and you can even have the game auto make a team comp, but without experimenting or prior knowledge can be little daunting and i would recommend looking up a guide to  help you along my recommendation for someone to explain the game would be https://www.youtube.com/user/Asmo2884 he explains some of the basics as well as some tips on most of the races            Overall:     Needs a bit more single player content such as a story mode similair to the original. The UI is a good improvment on the original although it has some quirks in it such as the placement of the end turn button. The AI is pretty decent to good. The one mode that they have in multiplayer is decent but needs improvments and they probably need more modes for multiplayer since that is the meat and potatoes for this game. All in all it's a solid game that to be built upon though it needs improvements. I would recomend this by getting it on a sale bundled with the original, you can get it for 20.00$ bundled with the chaos edition of BB1. if you want a score for the game it gets a 74/100.         Other Notes:      Lizard are really annoying they should get some sorta nerf as it's getting boring having 60% of my games against them. The game also should get a ranked multiplayer system in terms of the coach's skill as well as the team rating. I'm also going to restate this, TRY TO GET IT ON SALE WITH THE ORIGINAL as many people complain it has way less content than the original it's still a good game and has improvements on the original you can be the judge.

The spectator mode can be a bit clunky  but it works so you can view your matches with all of nuffle's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t thrown in there.             Multiplayer:     The way you play the multiplayer is by entering a league then playing through the season in that league(although some leagues don't really have seasons it's just kind of playing against other people) some of which go into elimination stages making things very interesting to see who will win. There are other leagues such as the official bloodbowl  league in which you just play against a random opponent when you want to which is where i mostly delve into. Team building is simple enough and you can even have the game auto make a team comp, but without experimenting or prior knowledge can be little daunting and i would recommend looking up a guide to  help you along my recommendation for someone to explain the game would be https://www.youtube.com/user/Asmo2884 he explains some of the basics as well as some tips on most of the races            Overall:     Needs a bit more single player content such as a story mode similair to the original. The UI is a good improvment on the original although it has some quirks in it such as the placement of the end turn button. The AI is pretty decent to good. The one mode that they have in multiplayer is decent but needs improvments and they probably need more modes for multiplayer since that is the meat and potatoes for this game. All in all it's a solid game that to be built upon though it needs improvements. I would recomend this by getting it on a sale bundled with the original, you can get it for 20.00$ bundled with the chaos edition of BB1. if you want a score for the game it gets a 74/100.         Other Notes:      Lizard are really annoying they should get some sorta nerf as it's getting boring having 60% of my games against them. The game also should get a ranked multiplayer system in terms of the coach's skill as well as the team rating. I'm also going to restate this, TRY TO GET IT ON SALE WITH THE ORIGINAL as many people complain it has way less content than the original it's still a good game and has improvements on the original you can be the judge.

												I really wish there weren't so many complaints from the hardcore blood bowl audience regarding not being able to play some of the really exotic blood bowl teams from table top or chaos edition. As a new player, Blood Bowl 2 is one of the best games I've played in years. It's competitive, there's a lot of strategy, interesting progression, great competition. The graphics and presentation are clean and intuitive.I made the mistake of listening to the complains and I ended up wasting money buying chaos edition, when for a new player this game is way, way better. It's not that ""the graphics are better"" it's that the interface is cleaner and informative. It shows you information about how likely things are to succeed and the interface is way smoother.There is a reason all the youtube videos are all Blood Bowl 2, it's because chaos edition is a confusing mess to look at - and unless you're a hard core player - this version is way better.

												I bought this game without expecting to much, and I pleasantly surprised ! I knew Bloodbowl for a long time but couldn't get in it because the rules were so cryptic I didn't understood much, but I decided to bought this one anyway and couldn't be happier that there is a true tutorial that help you understanding the rules, but also the UI is made to be the more understandable it can, percentage are directly shown, you can see the zone between an enemy player where you will be hit if you pass and a lot of things like that.For the moment there is only 8 races I think, with already 2 more in DLC and probably more to come. A lot of people complain about this but since the 8 races seems to really play differently, it is already enough, and for the DLC, I hate them as anybody, but since the game is ""only"" 45 euro, it don't bother me as much.So if you're looking for a cool turn based strategy based with a sport coating, this one could be it !

												Not worth the money wait until they release the definitive dlc addition next year with all the teams. Most peoples problem with this game is that it feels imbalanced toward the ai, which is actually true as the AI will know how certain rolls will pan out before they actually happen. Iv seen ai move away from my ball carrier into a pointless postion only to have them one dice knock my ball carrier down, the ball rolls out of bounds and is tossed back in directly into their repositioned players hands. That beings said its somewhat neccessary as the AI isnt exactly the sharpest and to my knowledge there is no way to raise their skill level.Now in terms of multiplayer this game works very well, there is little to no effort to join a league and iv never had any serious problems mid game. The addition of Britonnia is also a welcome change as they offer a somewhat bashier variety of humans that come with abilities that make the game more interesting. Half the fun in my opinion is assembling a team, naming them and forming emotional investments in their careers. Though teams are not neccesarily balanced there is not neccesarily a need for them to be as the game is based on luck above all things. Yes teams with stronger stat lines will help you hedge your bets but where is the fun in that. All of that being said, its not worth the price. Blood bowl has always been a game that could easily inspire frustration or excitement. If your looking to play with friends online or you want to test your skills agaist strangers then you probably already bought this. If your new to the game and wanted to try your hand at single player and work your way up, dont bother with this buy blood bowl chaos addition for at most half the price. The campain and leagues seem less interactive then its predessesor, all youl be missing are some shiny graphics and brettonia: both things dont add up to a 40$ purchase.

												Blood Bowl doesn't get as much love as it deserves. While it isn't a 1 to 1 conversion of the board game, it is the hands down best turn-based tactical murderous football experience you can digitally play so far.I can't help the feeling that most of the downvotes of Blood Bowl are made by die hard tabletop fans or people who can't deal with RNG and the complexity of the rules and skills.While I can understand that neither casual mainstream gamers nor die hard Blood Bowl tabletop fans will love Blood Bowl 2, I still believe it is one of the best competitive turn-based games currently out there and do recommend it greatly.

												I've been playing BB1 Chaos Edition for over 200 hours - often friendly matches with a friend online. I knew that the rules, the abilities of the players as well as the team rosters would not change in BB2: I was nevertheless really looking forward to the new version: the graphics looked great, the commentary seemed fresher (maybe even with more variations?), the transfer market sounded like a good feature.After playing the first matches I cannot recommend to buy this, but rather to stay with or try out the BB1: Chaos edition.Some reasons for this recommendation are:- As usual many races (teams) are missing from this first version of BB2- Even less pre-generated teams than in BB1:CE (only three per race)- The options for customization of graphics and controls is limited / non existing.- The language selection is limited to english and french (not a point of major critics but still less options than in BB1:CE).- Some other features from the 6 year old BB1 are missing: most prominient the team editor - I cannot customize a team to use e.g. in a friendly match by adjusting its team value, its players skills and equipment- no possibility to change camera perspective during the match.  Wait for the game to be patched to completion or to drop in price.			"

												For fans of the old Games Workshop game, Blood Bowl 2 is a faithful reproduction of the board game, but without depending on having a local place to set up a league night. Same rules, same gameplay, all the fun with less work. The interface is mostly intuitive, though with an occasional misclick can be a frustrating way to lose a point. Helpful hints like coloring to indicate tackle zones, and popup bubbles to explain your chance of success on various actions tend to make up for it, though, and I imagine misclicks will happen less often as the interface becomes second nature.My biggest complaint is that the rules documentation is woefully incomplete, with some elements like interceptions almost entirely missing from the supposedly detailed rules document available online. Hopefully, this will be completed at some point, but in the meantime, it's possible to find the boardgame's tournament rules online, and the computer game appears to mirror them faithfully.Overall, definitely worth picking up.

												The game is great. It is a strategy and board game with some chance element (dice) that need some research and analysis to understand the plays and your chances to make it happen. You can set up your own team by buying or firing players and level them up as they get xp. There are some polishing to be made but the game is already great the way it is. It's not an easy game and maybe that's why the it's getting some negative feedback. I already have 150hrs on this game in less than a month so that by itself says a lot about how much I like the game. Buy it and lets play online together ;).			"

												Not going to lie, this was a bitter disappointment after waiting since the first announcement. Shame on me for trusting the legacy and not reading any reviews before buying BBII. Single player ""Campaign"" has been reduced to a TUTORIAL staring the Reikland Reavers. You can't even choose another team. Personally I don't care about PVP or ladder. I just wanted a nice graphic/ui update to the single player game I already enjoyed. If single player comes back in a meaningful way I'll revisit.+++Updated+++Thanks @Secular for pointing out the Old World League! I do miss the map but it's not a dealbreaker ;)			"

												Bloodbowl is bloodbowl, caging, breaking cage and screening, if you are a fan you will like the game. But the game itself is very poor (no team customisations, no racial cheerleaders, no skin upgrade per level (what ?? seriously in 2015 no skin upgrade on players, bunch of lazy devs !) solo is a joke, multi config non existant), and badly designed (console UI, TV is ok but in replay you can't go back or forward ... all seems so amateurish,there is no graphic options !!).The game itself is not bad (animations are great), but lacks of polishing ( stadium are just jokes) and are far too long ... 1h30 - 2 h per match isn't correct. The ratio time given/ xp earned is too high.. graphics are ok but not amazing at all (again for a bloodbowl 2015 game, its far too low, it's not like they had to create a complete game, the rules are the same since 35 years...)But the most important is that the number of teams available (8) is so small you get bored really fast...how in hell can they thought 8 races for a modern 50 bucks game would be tolerated ? the game had bad reviews from players mostly because of this and it's totlally normal. BOREDOMBOWL 2...To finish, on 10 matches today , i had 7 times a match against Lizard Men who at this stage of the game is the team everyone plays because it's OP and that's one of the consequence of all this lazy greedy (dlc..) dÃ©cisions of Cyanide..it's a game of our times, fake work for quick cash.

												So the game concept is good the art is fun and the matches can be interesting...  However sometimes it comes down to sheer dumb luck.  It can be frustrating and enjoyable depending on which side of the ball your on...With all that being said I am going to post one reason alone not to get this game which is the actual match making functions...  Several times now I have been matched up against teams over a thousand points ahead of me.  When my highest guy is level four and his lowest guy has more experience then my entire team put together...Yes the game then gives you inducements in the form of petty cash.  However if the person your going against is that high ranking he usually has some freegold to buy his own as well.  That and even with what you can buy those basic skills the player has leveled up are better by far then anything you can buy and your regular team becomes just targets...So why not to buy?  Because against those teams that the computer matches you your only option is to quit out.  If you play them they will literally just kill and injure all your players to the point you have to delete your team.I understand I am not going to win every match however until the matchmaking system has a cap limiting such a huge imbalance it is simply  not worth playing.  Investing 20 hours into a team then having it wiped out because the computer thought your level 3 and 4 guys can take on another  team of level 7s with full inducements...This game does have potential it needs to have some serious looks at certain functions of it as it stands though.

												More of the same from Cyanide Studios....but slllooowwweeed doooowwwnnn..dear God, it takes about 10 mins to make a 2min turn and taking into account that there are now eight turns per half, prepare yourself for 90 min matches.For me, this is simplty too slow, there are never any chance to have a feel of continuity with a team when it feels like about a week between coaching sceens. The main thing I loved from the first Bloodbowl (which I was a sucker for, buying all DLC etc) was the way your team grew and improved itself over time. This now takes so long that it is hardly a factor. I now find myself too bored between turns to properly focus, leading to a lack of tacticality and so lose more matches, meaning Im less into it, leading the whole experience into a death spiral which inevitably leads me to reach for a different game.Overall, slow, not much new, just a moneymaking re-hash from a studio that has lost the original meaning of the bloodbowl...a shame.

												Blood Bowl 2 is a very fun, very strategic game with a football concept. Its not so much about scoring, as it is bashing the opposition into the ground. Heavily developed towards multiplayer, youll never run out of people to challange. The single player campaign leaves much to be desired, and solo leagues offer randomized matches with less then perfect AI. DLC expansions, such as races run for about 10 bucks a faction. Graphics are an improvment, though they could be better also. With limited factions and a high base price,This is a game u should pick up on a sale rather then full price. And possibily a later date as new updates and DLC role out. A well deserved 8/10, seeing as how im still addicted.			"

												I played a lot of Bloodbowl 1 and its various editions, and I have to say I've greatly enjoyed the time I spent in that world.Is this game a worthy successor.  Yes.It plays very well and is a lot of fun, Online is where this game comes into its own and works best in a league with a bunch of friends.  This is a great competition game which requires a lot of skill and tactics to play well, with risk taking often being the deciding factor in victory or defeat.I find it funny that people are complaining about underwhelming single player campaign, its a tutorial for the online game, and it is limited for a reason.  I often wonder if these same people look at games like Counterstrike and Dota and complain that they arent single player oriented aswell... How about get some friends, and play the game versing a non-exploitable AI for once.In short, I think this game is a worthy successor to the Bloodbowl Franchise.  It plays very well, has a bit of a learning curve but nothing you couldn't suss out after a few games of a short hit of the campaign, and is a lot of fun.  When reading other reviews, look how many times people complain about the AI, and remember what I've said... This game is like fun chess, with violence and dicerolls.			"

If you know what the game is about: B.S., Elf and otherwise and some tactics, then it is a pretty solid implementation. Here is a half a games worth of gameplay (be prepared for long games):

												This game is basically what you make of it.  First, be prepared to get frustrated.  Whether it be that your most important player getting killed, not being able to pick up the ball, or failing a block or series of blocks to get that all important TD.2nd, be prepared to jump out of your seat in dis-belief!  Sometimes you will do the most rediculous thing/s and everything (even with the worst odds) will fall right into place.3rd, this game is based mostly on strategy and how well you can manage or minimize your risk of die rolls.  (and yes, the die are random at ALL times.  that means that anything can happen).Concept of the game:Think of Rugby (closest thing I can think of) that is very bloody.  Players punch each other (called blocks) in attempts to get the upper hand of the pitch (field of play).  Kickoffs, fouls, and other aspecs come into play as you set your strategy to score....With 10+ teams available to choose from (from the time of this now edited review), you play strategies based on the way you decide to grow your team.  Do you get as many players as possible to foul the opponent?  Do you upgrade your stadium?  Or do you save your money for the big guy?This game does have a good tutorial and can teach you the mechanics of the game.  As far as strategy though, you will have to learn that part yourself or.....(go to the next part)""This game is what you make of it!""I mean this part.  The greatest aspect of the game is not knowing what will happen.  You can plan a flawless strategy to only watch it fall apart because a player failed in what you wanted him to do.  The good thing is that the opponent will have the same worries and problems (although it may not be in the same match...lol).  Dealing with that frustration is the biggest thing.Another thing is that since their is no in game chat area for people, it may be hard to find a league to play in.  You may be able to look on steam forums or other areas of the internet.  Either way, you will have to do some searching to find ""groups"" for league play (unless playing the AI is your thing).  The league that I am in is called ""Gobbln"" (that is the correct spelling).  You can google it and perhaps that will help you get started.  Great place to meet others.  TS is available for our group.  And Gobbln is always willing to teach you as well to help you be better competition.In the older version (Blood Bowl Chaos), you got to see the difference between upgraded players and rookie players with visual differences.  However, in this version, you must either hover over the player to see what skills they have or use the control button to toggle all players abilities as there is no visual differences between skilled and rookie players.They could have also added in more stuff to the game such as apothecaries working on wounded players, Bloodweiser Babes selling Bloodweiser in the stadiums, etc...  But the game is still pretty darn good without those added things.And lastly, they are coming out with a legendary edition.  With this edition, they are adding in a few things and is considered an upgrade for those that already own the game.  Cost wise, Blood Bowl is ideal in keeping customers.  Its not like a ""f2p"" game where you get added benefits of being a subscriber.  Rather, its more like you buy the big game, then you can opt to purchase more teams and such like things.  You don't have to buy it all, even if you did, the cost is still pretty darn good overall.  I spent around 40$ to buy the original, got a few free teams when they became available, and purchased the rest at discount prices.  So the total I paid is around 55$ up to date.What is the game worth?It is worth what they ask for it.  If you get it at a discount, always better.  Before you buy it though, I suggest that you youtube it or even twitch it and see what the gameplay is like and see if it is your ""cup of tea!""			"

												I play very little on-line simply because my schedule is erratic, so this will be about the single player only.I do like these games - 200+ hours on CE before trying this version - though they definitely have their flaws.  Going through the campaign here is, well, it isn't.  It's a turorial rather than a campaign.  You can create single-player leagues in multiple variants, which is okay, but it would be nice to have a story to go along with it like Chaos Edition has.  That being said, CE also went and crashed out on me semi-regularly doing their campaign, so... at least this version hasn't done that?There are visual disappointments, though that's mainly in the 'filler' stuff: no fans in the stands (though the camera pans across them); the only cheerleaders are human (likewise the goons that get players pushed off the field); and your character doesn't change much as they improve (outside of mutations).  I'm also not fond of only being able to see one side of the field in isometric view (you have either straight up & far away or swoop down behind to the left or right).The sound has its disappointments, too: the announcers get repetitive, obviously, but that's kind of expected in a sports game; better is that they sound more conversational, and are more a part of what's going on on the field.That being said, I will be keeping this on my playlist, because the game is fun.  It plays well, and for the lack of variation the visuals of the player movement is very good - even with the mutations.  8)  Being able to see the die roll results along the bottom of the screen tempers the occasional blind rage at getting three 1s in a row - especially when you see it happen to your opponent the next game.And they didn't muck about with the gameplay - altering your home stadium provides some slight rule changes, but otherwise the dice determine a lot of it.  This is a semi-strategy game, after all: you can mitigate risks, but never eliminate them.Releasing the game before all the teams were ready to go is a bit annoying, but given the different appearances of all the positional players on all the teams, it was either that or wait a few more years.  Looking forward to the new teams as they emerge.  WHERE MY NURGLES AT?Eh, until they are available, I guess Chaos will have to do...It's a silly, psychotic board game brought to life, so it might be a bit petty to ask for a playable storyline to go with it; but I'm a solo player, and that kind of thing is important to me.  Given that's my only serious complaint, I think this is worth purchasing overall.  You might want to stick with Chaos Edition until all the races are ready for BB2, since the gameplay is the same, but it is a nice looking update.  Jim and Bob sound better, too - not quite as disconnected from the game being played and each other as in Chaos Edition.EDIT: One more thing: be careful that you give the game a second to 'settle' before clicking on what direction a player is getting pushed in!  The game screen shifts juuuust a bit after an action is complete, so it is disturbingly easy to select the wrong square.  Irritating, but quickly adapted to.			"

NO! absolutely NO!If you didn't get the chance to buy the game at day one, wait until you get it for for 20%+ off.

												Being new to Blood Bowl I heartily reccomend this, I've had a lot of fun with it just playing against the AI. The campaign is just a rather long winded and restrictive tutorial with a pre-made human team, but you can create your own solo league to play with whatever team you want against AI so there's plenty of singleplayer fun to be had if like me you don't feel up to taking on real opponents.One thing to note is that this makes heavy use of dice rolls to determine the outcomes of actions, if that usually doesn't bother you then you'll probably still find yourself cursing the game for it occasionally as a couple of unexpected bad rolls can be absolutely devistating, so if you aren't tollerant of that sort of thing you should probably pass on this. However once you learn about the mechanics you'll find that it's done quite well and there are many tools you can use to minimize failure and manage the risks, there's a lot of fun to be had trying to work around the risky moves and it's quite satisfying when the bad rolls happen and you have set things up so that it's only a minor inconvenience.There's enough content to justify the price but more DLC is likely to come so you may want to wait for a sale so you dont drop too much on it.

Not bad graphics mind you but just the face she expresses is a very stale/bored looking face. My friends are currently debating whether they will make small things like that part of the game for free or will they make us pay for it via more DLC. I have hope though :D That said, you the reader may not and if so I would recomend wait a few more months.Also while playing in solo leagues against the AI is good practice and for building a team it won't net you the fun of playing against human players. Last thing I can say is that the campaign is very meh. I'm on the third mission and I find myself supremely bored with it.			"

												I've been a fan of the boardgame for many years but I found its complexity, length and opponent availablity a problem. These has been solved with this beautifully rendered digital version. While is doesn't boast all the possible teams of the previous iterations, Blood Bowl 2's in-game interface displays a lot more info neatly and team management is vastly improved. They've also streamlined the game to guide you to multiplayer; simplifying the single player experience but I think this is for the better. You'll get the most out of multiplayer if you join one of the many communities around the game.Unfortunately, at time of writing, there are some annoying, sometimes game breaking bugs and missing features; and the developer hasn't been very vocal about plans to patch. They've also implemented microtransactions and the other teams should be coming as DLC; but so far the microtransactions seem to be cosmetic only. It must also be said that the tutorials are rather poor for the complete novice.I highly recommend this game but not to people who expect a perfect product or unwilling to take the time to learn the mechanics.

												Blood Bowl 2 is a much-needed update for the video game conversion of the original board game. Due to its status as a miniature-based strategy game, the original Blood Bowl was a bit too niche to see mainstream distribution despite being fantastic, so I was very happy when the original video game came out. Pros:-Blood Bowl 2 has fixed most of the interface and optimization issues that plagued its predecessor.-Improved graphics and animations-Vastly improved RNG-Easy quick match features in addition to online league play-The gallows humor is a good as everCons:-Race-based cheerleaders removed (they were one of the funniest parts of the based game)-Limited (but expanding) list of available races-Campaign mode is restrictive and (from a veteran perspective) doesn't do a very good job of explaining the mechanics to new players despite largely being a tutorial. It's never been easier for new players to get into Blood Bowl, and while veterans may (rightfully) be wary of the lack of teams, the dev team has steadily been releasing teams at pretty reasonable price points. It's a great adaptation of an even better game. "

												Blood Bowl 2 provides you with a real ""sport"" aspect, something which was a bit lacking on BB1, and very nice animations, cleaner information, and overall a much more polished experience.The real flaw of BB2 is the lack of Career Mode. However, as I discovered hours later into the game, you can pretty much compensate this by creating your solo team and then entering a World League, in which you can play several seasons and qualify for a World Cup every season. Custom World League itself has been improved and streamlined since launch, and this really compensates  for something that was so lacking.The next flaw in the game would then be the AI. On that area I can't say it has been fixed. AI can beat you at times (once every 20 matches for instance) but fails on many occasions.Other people are also asking for the full roster of 21 races.We have a fair number of races, but the point I see with the DLCs is that Expansions could have been better - because with expansions, you also refine features. Here we received race DLCs - and races are really nice, and these DLCs have also been provided for free to so many people - but we haven't seen so many refinements.However, I've seen the much asked Stats (player and team stats) come into the game, something we've requested at launch, proving the devs listen to us. In BB2 you have:- a single player tutorial campaign with the Reikland Reavers; a welcome things but an easy campaign, and so much less than a career mode.- a hidden career mode but without the nice career map we hade on BB1- ability to create your own teams and play them in custom solo matches or multiplayer!- multiplayer and multiplayer leagues, which are much improved over BB1. This is where BB2 currently shines.- graphics and rules implementation are cleaner and better- AI has been improved from Troll status to Black Orc status.On its own Blood Bowl is a great turn-based strategy game, with a lot of risk management involved.The computer version is ver comprehensive and plays like a great game, with animations,sporty-feeling made with all passion and heart.This deserves a thumbs up.Some people will find rules or dice are hard on them - but game design wise, this game allows the player to manage his risks pretty well, much better than many other boardgames I've come to experience (here I look at Heroes of Normandie, which doesn't allow risk management),. It is sad AI also cannot handle the big thing, or that Career mode was hidden and less implemented.I still hope you'll enjoy the game and its multiplayer - the BB2 community has been great, with only one player out of 10 or so being unpolite, and 5 out of 10 being very pleasant players. (leaving four neutral as stones ;) ) "

												Just like the boardgame, Blood Bowl 2 is fantastic.  Fast paced, easy to learn, fun animations.My only gripes are: the menus are a little clunky and counter-intuitive, it is really easy to double-click and make a move you didn't intend, and the cost of all the separate teams.  It would be nice if you could team bundles, instead of each team individually.			"

												The ride was real.When I first purchased this game, I played a variety of teams. First, I tried humans, then orcs, and ended with dwarfs. The dwarfs were the only ones I felt comfortable with, since they all had high armor, and the block skill, which is pretty much essential in Blood Bowl. Now when I first played this, I thought the game was repetative, and that it was lacking content. For the first few months it was out, I was right. They restricted the content flow into a steady stream of DLC, and it made me feel cheated.However, that changed after some time. After owning the game for a while, I stopped playing for a good couple of months. When i came back, I realized I had 2 more choices for teams to play with. I was surprised, to say the least, since I didn't buy these. But as it turns out, they gave this to all players who bought the game previously for free. I was very happy, they started listening to critisism, and while a few issues haven't been fixed in the game (Animations and Models for example) it is still very worth your time.The gameplay is random. You can surely give your players skills, but once they enter the field, even your most experienced player can be obliterated in the first pitch. This is a mixed bag of goodies, resulting in unrelenting rage from your players constantly getting bad rolls, to sheer joy when you crush the opponent once and for all. It made me think no longer as a strategist (even though it stuck around) and made me think more like a high stakes gambler. ""Should I rely on the Troll-Slayers Dauntless skill to activate against that Treant?"" I'll often ask myself, and most of the time, I'll decide it with a coin flip if I really cannot decide. But I digress, there is a fair amount of strategy in this, and I appreciate that.My overall opinion of the game is that it got a rocky start, and seemed a little confused, but now, I can confidently say this a game well worth your time and money if you like random fun and having dwarfs punch orcs in the groin.

												The game is not ready yet. Released with a few teams and focused only on multiplayer it is not worth yet. Maybe they get this right someday. The worst is, teams will come as DLC to grab a little more cash. Remain with the first game that it is much better. I bought this thinking it would have changes as they talked about the new races and stuff like this but everything is already being delayed. If this game someday get better than the first I'll change my review.12/08/2016 - Ok, time to change my review. as the new races of founder's pack have been released the game has had some improvements that are enough for me to recommend it.Is it better than the first one? It depends for what you want it. This one focus to much on multiplayer and I don't have many friends that play it, and since there is not a matchmaking system I can't play with other people (I'm a casual player)I think some kind of carrer mode where you use your created teams would turn this to be the best Blood Bowl.

Dont get me wrong its pretty and if this is your first taste of blood bowl it will be a nice experiance for you. But over use of the same animations will have tou turning them off quickly.The devs have watered down the game or done something very wrong because this game lacks something, someone in my chat called it the soul of blood bowl and I have to agree with them.The lack of teamsThe lack of game modesThe lack of a stadium for each teamThe Campaign is human onlyNo new kill/injury animationsBlock animations are incredibly repetativeand these are only the beginings of a list of flaws but some of the most glaringIn short I hope these issues and others are resolved in forth coming patches but as of right now, AVOID THIS GAME!Go back and play chaos edition till this is worked on, it currently seems rushed and not at all worth it's priceI had high hopes for it but honestly its left me with a sour taste in my mouth			"

												Great game. Graphics look amazing and a massive leap forward over the old version which was so ugly it was basically unplayable. A lot of time and money has gone in to the look. The engine is slick and performs OK. No CTD's or bugs for me as of yet. The gameplay is where its at though - its massively addictive. Player/team progression rocks and is faithful to the board game with a few tweaks here and there to the rules. Two things really stand out for me from these reviews. 1. Please take all the haters with a pinch of salt. They aren't wrong, this is bare bones compared to the previous version(s), but its functional, looks good and plays great. All the extra stuff bitter vets want that isn't included isn't something you are going to miss as a newcomer. 2. Don't be misled in to beleiving you will get satisfying multiplayer on public servers. You may, chances are though you won't. As for the game itself - its amazing. It really is. I never played the board game and I regret it now. The rules are simple (even if the strategy surrounding a play is anything but!) and you can pick them up easily enough. There's a wealth of online resources to plumb. Every single game is fresh and suitably random at times to keep your riveted. I've beated guys with 3 players left standing. I've beaten teams much higher rated due to a stroke of luck with the dice etc. Likewise you need to be prepared to get owned. Especially by bashy teams and agility teams. You need XP to get skills on your players to make them effective against elves and stuff. Don't judge the game by the first few matches you play. Overall, this is a well balanced, stable, beautiful update to the classic boardgame of yore. Sure there's niggles with customization, ui, online play etc. There are things we wish were included at release. Its also overpriced. All things you can live with and/or shop around to get a better deal etc.  "

												Blood Bowl 2 is still relatively poor content wise in comparison with previous installments, but even with a small roster of teams and a lack of visual variety (character faces, cheerleaders etc) it can still give you many hours of good fun.The original board game is compelling. Frustrating at times but not as unfair as some make it sound. It's so nice to have the computer make all the calculations for you and present them in what I find a pretty clear way. The UI could probably be improved but I find it very efficient already.The campaign is quite fun (even though it's for human/empire team only)  and a good intro to the game mechanics. The AI is pretty good though it's probably better to play that kind of games against other people.A solid game with a not so bad model : it seems that if you buy the game now, you'll get many future pieces of DLC for free.I recommend it			"

												I don't know why this game is getting so much hate. I've tried blood bowl one and never got into it because it was way to much to handle as a newbie, blood bowl 2 however is easier atleast even though it takes some time to get into.Only gripe i have with the game is that there's no save in solo play mid-match (Shouldn't be too hard to fix?).Also the game is dice based, something people overlook in my opinion. That means games might be heavily in favor of either side depending on the risks you take or just because you are unlucky/lucky. I really like the rng aspect but if you want something that is solely strategic thinking then this game is probably not for you.On a side note: This game will probably be better over time with more diveristy in races and hopefully some fixes to make certain processes easier (Like re-naming units before their first match and such).

												Brilliant. The Blood Bowl we know and love looking more gorgeous than ever. The UI is nice, neat and intuative.The new campaign mode is nice for beginners as it introduced one concept of the game at a time, however it can be a little tedious for those who have played before. The commentary is pretty funny though and the mini story is in keeping with world setting. All round good.			"

Product received for free
												If the game is on sale, or you have some friends who will play the game with you, it's a great pickup. The game has drastically improved from it's state at launch, and though there are still some problems (matchmaking isn't quite there yet, league management tools are still lacking), it has still become a much more polished game than what it once was.

												What do you get when you purchase Blood Bowl 2? Quite simply, a great muliplayer experience if, and only if, you are a good sport and not a rage quitter. Rather than a basic review, I will point out the differences between this version, and the previous installments.First, there are less races. More are coming, but really, this is a minor problem. You won't see the Halflings, Vampires, Ogres with snotlings, or Goblins. These 4 teams in particular are mostly uncompetitive anyways. More teams are being added and there are enough to keep you busy from the start.No single player experience worth mentioning exists. It really didn't exist in the previous version, either. Why? The AI was terrible beyond reason. You could easily win nearly 100% of your games once you knew the holes in the AI. If you check the message boards, players complained endlessly about the AI being stupid. Having a worthless single player campaign in Blood Bowl 2 follows the same trend as its predecessors.This game is all about multiplayer. Having an easy cakewalk in the previous games will not teach you what this game is about. You have to understand that winning consistantly is difficult. Bad things can happen on every turn. You will only understand the unforgiving nature of this game by playing against real life people. The dice don't care about you. Rolling back to back failures happen just as astounding lucky plays do. The game is played by assuming you will fail the next roll.Rage quitting isn't smart this time around. Be warned you will not gain star points for disconnecting, and your opponents will love you for it, because they will receive free points. Take your beatings when they are handed to you, and try again. At some point, your opponent will suffer from having horrible luck.I suppose its worth mention the UI isn't the greatest. The previous versions has the same problem. No loss there, either.Verdict? If you want to experience Blood Bowl like it should be, get this version. Keep in mind the original game was a board game that required another person, obviously. Wishing for a deep single player campaign is irrelevant. Playing Chess or Checkers against an AI is just as pointless. You learn more playing against actual people.If you are weak, and would have your self esteem injured because you can't win every game you play, Don't play this game. If you can handle a few good beat downs, I'll see you on the pitch.			"

												Great game with a lot of potential to grow. It requires a fair bit of knowledge to play competetivly and thus is not for everybody but, if you enjoy turn based strategy games with a lot of variables this is for you.Interface and graphics are greatly improved upon BB:CE. Sadly t's still missing a few important features like the grid or togglable player names/positionals. Overall great game 8/10 atm.			"

The main thing is that the interface is a lot better, but they also took some of the information away (hopefully to be added later).I know I'll play this game as much as the previous one(s), and the DLC part of it is actually better than their previous business model.Many people post bad reviews because of less teams, but the number will increase.

												This game has its moments, it realy does. It pays off to plan in advance and every race has its lilttle quirk.  Sadly i find all this all pales to what i see as a major flaw, the luck system. When you are on a lucky roll you can knock out half the AI team in a couple of turns for a easy victory but when the bad luck hit you may as well give up. Spending four or five turns trying to pick up the ball in perfect conditions, having a large number of your tackles knock you down or cause turn over or just having alot of opponent tackles cause injuries/deaths. While a bad match can just be laughed off the permanent injury or death means that one match follows you until you replace/level up. For reference played solo for 80 hours odd so not just had one bad match and threw a hissy.			"

												Unfortunally it feels just like a vamped-up version of Blood Bowl, except there are a butt load of races missing (and will cost a fortune as a DLC later on). I also got the feeling that The Great God Nuffle, favors the AI more then the player, since the AI usually have better hits, sucessess and saves then what I get. I've had a round with a new team (dark elfs) that got totally mangled and 7 of 11 players ended up dead or injured before the 1:st half was over. After a few patches and perhaps a couple of free extra Teams (as an aplolgy for all the hazzle and segregation between pre-purchers and us that couldn't get it that way), makes the game very playable.

												A welcome improvement on the original. BB2 looks to keep the same game with a slapdash of higher graphical fidelity. -  Not launching with nearly as many races but enough variance to make an interesting game-  UI and Menus are a bit of a mess, presumably to make it fit all in for console players. Makes team management a bit of      a pain  -  Same old very very heavy RNG elements, if you don't have patience prepare to Alt F4 this game on your first bad game-  â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t Pre-order packageFans of the old will love it, people looking to pick it up will hate, until they'll love to hate it			"

												The matches can be entertaining but just from a single-player perspective I'd put this down as a miss. The AI is not capable at all of putting up a fight, it can occaisionaly win due to the heavy focus on RNG but it is worthless at even the basic blitz attack never mind any of the more advanced tactics.Never tried MP, I'll let others judge wether the game is worth it for that aspect.

												Not without its issues, Blood Bowl 2 still manages to be good fun whether you prefer single player or multiplayer. Although it has less races than the previous Blood Bowls, the new version is a lot more detailed and has more races on the way (Wood Elves and Lizardmen are going to be added soon).Pros:- 3/4ths the price of a mainstream new release- Most of the races offer decent customization and variety- The way American Football is meant to be played (decapitations, rampant and egregious fouling of downed players, and the occasional fireball lobbed onto the field)- Great depth of team and player development with persistent leagues and teams- Flexible integration of single player and multiplayer features. Play how you want, with who you want, when you want. AI, friends, randoms, whatever.Cons:- D6 based game with the RNG frustrations only D6 games are capable of. Some games are spent playing against the dice instead of the other team.- Some gameplay customization features are missing from the previous Blood Bowls. BB2 only has the core Blood Bowl gameplay and not the variant rules you could do in the BB1 games.- Some teams like Bretonnians lack variety.- Injury rolls are somewhat obscure and opaque to the player.- League customization is excellent, but there is no individual match customization.

												Completly new player unfriendly game (not the community, the game)Cannot recommend to anyone but people who like to torment themselves with a game based on skill but mostly on annoying RNG. If you have the patience for the RNG and stupendously slow gamepace (animations are slowing the game pace down amongst other mechanics) then this could be the game for you. Oh and it gets tediously boring when you know you cannot win, because you can just sit there and take it for x amount of turns or concede and get no rewards at all...fun. Why isnt there a feature where both agree the game is over, that the game ends and players get their respective rewards (the loosers obviously diminished but still get something).Adding to that ageing players, and low customization....On sale its decently priced...but i wouldnt really recommend it anyway, i sort of regret my purchase but now its to late.Edit: Atleast i got my fair share of gametime for the money spent, most of it frustrating but still.So if you get it on sale and count your entertainment at 1$/hour or there abouts, then go for it, you might actually get decent value for your money (dont buy all the dlc thou, read up because you might never use certain races.)

												As usual the whiners are out in force demanding refunds and crying like little girls who've lost dolly.The game is great. If you are a fan of Blood Bowl it's a no brainer. If you like turn based strategy this could well stratch that itch.I enjoyed BB1 but I hated the UI, the presentation and most of all it's total lack of personality and atmosphere. Something that for me is essential in  Warhammer game.BB2 fixes all those things. The Stadiums feel alive and buzzing with excitement. The player animations are great and brutal. The base game and rules are pretty much the same, it's Blood Bowl afterall. Personally I'm playing with a controller which works great but KB/M are just as good (better even).Graphical options are limited but lets face it, you don't need them on a game like like this.The Campaign is fun and eases new players into the game and rules and the custom solo leagues are great. I've yet to play multiplayer.The number of teams/races is limited right now as it was when the original launched. They will no doubt be added via DLC, just like the original.Dice rolls can become infuriating when they don't go your way which is just like the real game. Against the AI I won just as many as I lost and never felt cheated. "

(random number generator)Difficulty may be too much for some. A lot of trial  and error is needed.Why so many negative reviews?Well, the last version Chaos Edition had 22 teams, this team has 8. People fail to understand that this game is reworked and rebuilt from the ground up. There isn't ""cut content"".Single Player Campaign is basically a tutorial and it only uses the Human team. People want a campaign mode for every team. Not only is this a lot more work, you have better alternatives such as creating a new league and playing with whatever team you want. This is the same as a single player campaign without all the added story bits. Same as BBCE.Hope this helps.			"

												This is a game that I really like, every hit feels like it is going to kill the other player and the tension is high throughout the game. And the fact that, even when you loose close to your whole team, you can still win if you play smart.Many people say that the price isn't justified, given certain things from Blood Bowl 1. And to that I ask, did you play it multiplayer? I have no idea how many times we had unstable games there, the game would just crash, hits didn't feel like they had an impact, the UI was pretty bad. This is much better in those aspects, and for me personally that is enough for me to say that I feel like this price is ok for this game.It really depends if you like this kind of game or not, ofc if you don't really enjoy this kind of game, you WILL feel ripped off, if you like it, then you have no qualms with it.And I don't know what the price is in other countries, but for me in Norway it was a ok price.

YouTubeâ¢ Video: cKnoor's beginners guide to Blood Bowl - Episode 1 - A bunch of rulesÂ 

			Views: 62,170		

			A lot of people have asked me for Blood Bowl advice lately, and while I try my best to help I figured it might be a good idea to put together a video for how to play Blood Bowl.		

An excellent port of the popular and well-received turn-based strategy board game which uses the newest LRB 6 edition of the rules. Blood Bowl (BB) is the game of Fantasy Football (with Elves, Dwarfs, Orcs etc.), akin to real-life Rugby (play only halts when a point is scored) or American Football, only with excessive violence, death, secret weapons and even magic. Oh, and the ball has spikes on it. BB 2 has a new and improved game engine with awesome brutal cinematics and a cleaner UI. As well as more multiplayer possibilities than BB 1 (player trading, stadium upgrades), there's a brand new narrative single player campaign that is simple enough to appeal to new players, but with just enough variety to engage long-time fans. Lots and lots of chaos and fun.Be aware: this game is based on dice-rolling, so luck plays a part. BUT there is also lots of strategy to it, from more basic ideas like risk management and positioning, to the more complex such as chain pushing and team builds/management/development (useful site - http://bbtactics.com/). 90% of the few hundred matches I've played (that's including previous versions of the game) have felt like the better player won. Sometimes bad luck really does strike yes, but if you analyse your game-play you usually could've made some better decisions, too. Don't be put off by what seems like bad luck in your first few games, but be warned that this game requires some patience to get good at. Online leagues are where Blood Bowl 2 really comes to life. The AI seems hard at first, but can become too easy quite quickly. Online you get the challenge of real players, can choose options such turn length (I would highly recommend 1 or 2 minute turns) and even make your own league. Matchmaking and ladder climbing in the biggest leagues is fun, but there's nothing better than playing a tournament with your friends :D			"

												I highly recommend Blood Bowl 2.  My experience is based on the beta and will be updated after a bit more time with the launch version. I also have a ridiculous # of hours logged with the previous game.  While I'm no expert on the game, here are some changes I've noticed in comparison to BB1: - Gold in your treasury adds to the TV once you have more than 150K.  Initially I didn't like this, however now I find myself much more willing to purchase inducements that exceed petty-cash values in matches, and this truly adds to the gameplay.  More importantly, I am no longer afraid to fill out a team roster with reserves. I think this was a great decision from the developer.- Team management is more robust. You have an upgradeable home-stadium. Player transfers / market is a feature (was not live during beta). All in all, teams feel like they have more of a life and identity. - Chances on action success are shown in a % tooltip. This will help players that don't initially understand the dice system (hey, I'm sure they exist). But moreover, it just helps with making quick choices in context.- The league system / interface appears to be better designed.- The standard grid overlay (which you could toggle on and off in the last game) is gone. In its place, there is a contextual grid on each player you select. It's not distracting and functions perfectly well. You now see a numeric indication of stacked tackle zones on any given tile.- Animation and gameplay feels more life-like / brutal, and fun!- The controls will feel strange at first. There is an option to toggle BB1 controls, and the BB1 camera (I recommend). Though the BB2 controls may work just fine for some, and the BB2 camera is actually enjoyable once you're comfortable with strategy.- You're no longer tied to your opponent's cutscenes. For those that remember from the first game, an angry player would remain idle at keyboard while you were spamming 'Esc.'.  This is handled much better.- The dice / roll log was limited. You see current roll results at the bottom of the interface. Hopefully a full log will be visible in the future.- The visible armor changes that occurred when a player leveled up, seem to have been cut. I thought it was a neat feature of the first game. (Not to be mistaken with mutations, which are visible after acquired).- The game occassionally crashes / becomes unresponsive immediately after launching into a new match (loading screen).That's it for now. Definitely worth a buy!			"

That odds of that actually happning is virtual none.  The AI is just as crappy as the last versions.  My friends who've played it have had the same problems.			"

So as a person who's put 70 hours into bb1 I'd say buy this game its fun and the britonians are a fun edition.So with that have fun on the pitch stomping eating or punching the hell out of goblins.

												I've  recently started playing Gameworshop games, and have really liked the amount of detail/lore/flavor in these games, if you like the Warhammer series, and...Chess? This game is wonderful, but i see it as some sort of Chess type of game, Imagine Chess with stats and character naming some customization and stats, that's bloodbowl 2, like chess with D&D characters, or something like that...Either way, I like this game, although it has a large learning curve and you'll have to spend a bit of time reading up about it, the gameplay is really fun and rewarding once you learn how. THIS ISN'T A VIOLENT NFL SPORTS GAME THOUGH, THAT'S WHAT I EXPECTED WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT,  FANTASY NFL, which it isn't, it's a digital boardgame, but nonetheless a very fun digital boardgame with nice graphics and mechanics. 5/5 once you learn to play it, 3/5 if you buy it just for the campaign and don't both to learn the game.Come test the waters, they're kinda chilly, but you'll get used to 'em.

The game seem to want you to only line up brawlers and take tunr punching each other hoping for stun,kill or injure roll.the good:1) the commentators2) voice acting3) animationsit seems like they got all the cosmetics right, but failed in making the game balanced or fun;; stupid game dont buy it.

Posted: October 6, 2015
												Welcome to the game of rolling dice, a simulator where it doesn't matter who you picked or what you do, because every decision you make comes down to whether you can roll 1d6. I played 12 games of this 'game' and let me give you a rundown of how each turn plays out. You get to move your players into positions to give them strategic advantages then fight the other team to knock them down. The most common 'advantageous' roll you'll get is 2d6 to pick one depending on what you want.So you roll 2d6.Double skulls. Skulls knock down your player, not theirs.So you use one of your ""team rerolls"" to change the outcome.Double skulls. Your player falls over and your turn ends instantly.You haven't moved anyone, or done anything. Your turn is done. The other guy then takes his turn, knocking down every single one of your team regardless of the odds. Heck, he can roll 2 dice disadvantaged and he'll 100% of the time score adouble knockdown that you can't avoid. Half of your team will be injured or KO'd in the first round and unable to play for the rest of the game which is IMPORTANT, as he now outnumbers you 11 to 5.Now it's your turn again. Somehow get 2d6 to roll.Roll double skulls.Use a reroll? Double skulls.You're saying to yourself at this point ""wow, this guys just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥tting. What a moron this never happens to me"". I played 12 games and this happened at least once in EVERY SINGLE GAME. Did it happen to my opponents? NO. If they tried to make plays where they needed to dodge twice, each time at 17%, would they make it? 100% of the time, yes. Not a single person I played against lost more than 2 rolls in the entire match. By the time it got to game 10, I was so sick of this rng nightmare that I was conceding on the third turn after most of my team were dead or had broken legs and missing limbs while his players were at the line with not a single penalty.I was under the impression that thinking about this game mattered in some way, but trust me, it doesn't, If I could go lower than 1/10 I would for this, but for the sake of it, lets just leave it at 1/10. Without reducing my settings to the lowest possible on quite a high end machine, the game crashed out constantly or took so long to register an action that a quarter of my turn was already wasted by the time people moved. On the first day I played, the servers were so broken it was disconnecting people midway through the match which forced both teams to concede a loss.This game is -not- playable in its current state and I would not recomend any of you spend even Â£5 on something you could replicate by buying 3d6 and shoving them down your friends throat while their young children watched. Â£35 is like asking a poor man for 3 of his limbs to give him a cup of water, not even slightly worth it.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.			"

												While as with many other people, I would recommend waiting to buy the game if you don't really like Blood Bowl already, the game itself is good.The campaign mode is an extended tutorial.  It is annoying.  It is frustrating.  The disabled rules don't take into account everything that can actually happen during matches based on existing, unlocked features, and so you can end up in situations where UI that should be available isn't.  Specifically have received reroll requests that couldn't be skipped in early parts.I recommend waiting on buying this.At $20 to $25, I'd be saying buy this now -- but there will be DLC, the base price will drop, there will be a DLC roll up, and then you can get the game and the rollup for half where the game is right now, most likely, in a year or so.I'm not saying ""$45 is too much"" necessarily.But I think a lower price tier -- which it'll settle at after a few months, anyway -- from the get go might actually earn you more (similarly a ""season pass"" for the DLC, and you know what -- at least a 2 pack and probably a 4 pack as well...  If thiere was a 4 pack listed, I likely would have done that)If you're new to Blood Bowl, you'll get a deeper introduction using either Dungeon Bowl or the previous Blood Bowl game.That having been said -- if you like Blood Bowl and don't own the previous one, you really can't go wrong with this.  If you like to play Blood Bowl, the UI and execution on this one is much better than the previous one.Note:If you create a multiplayer game,And you list it on Steam,You have to be absolutely insane not to have a bundle with multiple copies			"

While the AI will get good rolls for most of the time.The teams have some poor balance as well. With the two DLC teams being far better then the standard teams. Making the dlc feel like they are pay to win.Good luck playing MP. First you have to sign up for a league. Then spend the next few hours hoping someone in the league will want to play. I tried many times to get into an MP game and got bored after 2 hours waiting.I am hoping someone mades some dice mods so the game is at less playable. As right now it just a waste of money.			"

												The amount of people complaining about a lack of single player in a traditionally multiplayer game is frankly very confusing.This game is a delightful multiplayer game with true RNG and very unique well crafted teams with special units.While yes it has less teams than the last BB a lot of those teams had common pools of players (I'm lookin at you undead,vampires,etc) and now they each have their own design that's pretty unique without being distracting.People are also salty about how they are doing DLC teams while I concede it would be nice to be able to buy a package deal with all teams for cheaper I can see why they decided to do individual teams allowing the consumer to buy what they want with no extras. Just want Vampires when they come out? Just buy vampires. You don't have to buy 20 dollars worth of content to get the one thing you want for a couple bucks. Over all I'll reserve judgement until they put out actual DLC and not just the holdover stuff from the pre-orders that we knew about before the game even launched.It's flaws are pretty simple, sometimes the UI is a bit clunky, and there are occasional bugs that rarely impact gameplay.

												Game is terrible. Dice rolls are ridiculous. I am convinced that the game decides a winner on the loading screen. In every single match one player gets nothing but good rolls while the loseing team receives attacker down rolls over and over and over again, regardless if you stack your players logically. One side gets steam rolled from start to finish, no matter what. The laughable random number generator isn't the only problem. Where are all the races? Oh yea they are going to charge you 10 dollars a peice for them, so be prepared to shell out at least 100 dollars for access to everything that came with Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition. Summary: They cut half the game, forgot to test the dice, put a paint job on it, and hoped no one would notice.			"

Disappointing to only have 8 races at launch (two, Wood Elves and Lizardmen will be DLC shortly after release, and you get one free if you preordered), compared to the 20+ of Blood Bowl Chaos Edition, but I can understand that not every coach will want every team.

												Thinking back to the 90's when I used to play a lot of the BB board game, and loving it. I remember we used to talk about how cool it would be to have a computer version with the commentators from the rulebooks and chanting crowds, blood splatter etc.Enter Cyanide! First they made Chaos League, a ""pirate version"" of Blood Bowl that Games Workshop liked enough to ""lend"" out the Warhammer license. Then came Blood Bowl the PC version. It wasn't bad, just more of an upgraded Chaos League game with a terrible UI (among the worst i've seen).I remember reading about Blood Bowl 2 for the first time about a year ago. They described it as a more visual experience, more action, better graphics, better UI and better League Management among other new cool stuff.So, is this version better than the previous Blood Bowl PC version? Hell Yes!In almost every reguard.Is it 100% perfect? No, but really what game is?Really recommend it to both new players and old veterans like myself. "

												I have to say, I don't normally write reviews.  Mainly because you don't know if the person is just being whiny or not because he/she loses.  Well I can honestly say that this game seems to have more potential than most.  I want to LOVE it so much.  But I can't.  Its broken.  The rules it places for the game, it doesn't honor them half the time.  It doesn't balance a team of your lvl as your opponent, Unless you play solo and select easy.  DLC Teams are overpowered, which is all I fought in Multiplayer.  and 9 times out of 10... RNG WILL not let you have a chance in H**L of winning.  This CAN be great, but isn't in it's current state.  They need to fix team balance issues, multiplayer match-up balancing, the rules need to work, and work on making RNG not F**K up your day EVERY TIME YOU PLAY.  My opinion is unless you buy more(DLC) RNG will hate you.  It shouldn't be P2W if it's not a F2P game or an MMO at all.  Thank God I bought this on a SUPER discount or I would have been more upset then I am.  And this is a Prime reason I don't buy games anymore unless I can try them out 1st.  When/If they fix the game... I'll write a more positive review.  Oh and No I havn't won a game yet... but when RNG makes you're whole team stunned or knocked out or DEAD by Turn 3 it's hard to do, while the other team has 1 stun.  I hope they fix the game soon.

												Huge improvement from the first. Animations are beautiful, Models are beautiful, and the UI is much improved. The End turn button is in an odd spot, but I've never hit it accidentally, plus they are moving it. If you enjoy Bloodbowl, this is strongly recommended.  If you've never played it, then there is a bit of a learning curve. If people tell you it is solely luck based, they are wrong. Luck definitely plays a role, and if one team is very unlucky it can lead to a loss, but the more skill you have, the more you know about what risks to take, and when to take them. I would read some online guides before buying it, both to learn about the game and to figure out if it's a game you would enjoy.			"

												No fundamental difference with Blood Bowl 1 gameplay but more beautiful, more content for the multiplayer and solo modes, better IA adn easier to get access to through a campaign for beginners.As there is no other game like this one to compare it to, I strongly advise potential buyers to have a look at some live videos to make up their mind to avoid frustration but be aware that Blood Bowl 2 can quickly become addictive!

												Great fun, currently easy to find matches if you join an open league, campaign helps get the basics of the game down.  The game needs a little work and some more features added into it but nothing game breaking in the game as far as I can tell.  I am a bit disappointed about the DLC but hopefully people only buy DLC for races they want when they introduce it.			"

												So, I'd really love to play the game. I pre-ordered it before the beta, and when the beta came out, it didn't work. Everytime I start up the game, it crashed on the cabalvision loading screen. I assumed that it would be fixed after beta, and even though today is only the first day out of beta, I'm still irritated that it doesn't work. I've played Blood Bowl Chaos Edition for a while and I love it, and I'd really like to play this game too.			"

												I was a big fan of the original Blood Bowl, and I'm very happy with Blood Bowl 2. It hits all the right notes, offering the same spot-on tabletop play with better graphics, great block animations, and a lot of streamlined controls that clean up some of the misclick errors that could make Blood Bowl frustrating. I do miss having my beloved Lizardmen, but I'm making do with a Dark Elf team until they become available. Assuming the devs make good with their promises to add teams and options, this is a game I'll be playing for the long haul. If you like tactical boardgaming, Warhammer Fantasy, competative violence, or ideally all three, this is a definite recommend.			"

												Visually BB2 is a great improvment over BB1 is most ways.  Once they add most/all of the remaining teams I don't think there will be any looking back to BB1.  I didn't plan to pick it up because I've not been a fan of the way the devs have repeatedly divided their player base in the past and expected more of the same mismanged crap for BB2.  I did buy it though and am happy I did.  I love Blood Bowl, it's one of my favorite games of all time.  It's not without it's quirks  but I'm happy and don't regret picking it up, just wish they kept outfits leveling up with the players.			"

												It's amazing how the developers (Cyanide) could have only one job (translate the board game to the virtual environment), and yet still fail ... over and over and over.  I mean, how many times are they going to take a shot at doing this game?  For god's sake, the rules are already done--the player base just wanted a stable game.  Why is that so hard to friggin' understand?  WHY?  WHY THE HELL DID YOU FEEL THE NEED TO CHANGE THINGS?   It defies understanding how this dev team just feels the need to stomp this IP in the dirt, repeatedly.  Change the rules for no good reason?  Uh .....  Add stupid things, like stadiums, and stupid rules changes? What?   LoL.  OK.  Hell, why don't you just go and mess with the optional skill use rules and add ageing, or something ... Oh, you did that already?    ROFL.This game ... such a huge letdown.  The ONLY way you could enjoy this game is if you had never played it before.  Keep that in mind as you read through these reviews; you'll see a recognizable pattern emerge. "

Where are the Orc drummers and Dwarf beer-kegs?)- all stadiums have default human supporters on stands (it's really lazy design)- dice rolls can push your self-control to the limits (RNG saying you won't win this match because f*** you, that's why)Pros:- Jim & Bob - single player campaign - it's well written and interesting (even as a Dwarf/Orc player I enjoyed it a lot)- superb graphics and takedown animations (really, it looks so good)- lots of people playing leagues means you can get an online match in 10 seconds any time of day- it's a good ol' Blood Bowl  "

												It's a game copied from a boardgame with dice, the rules are on the internet and so are free online tabletop simulations of it.In all renditions it's a game of crisis management where RNG stands for Random Number Grief. The dice are merciless.There is no fun from the get-go. There is none, it cannot be seen in plain sight and you will never find it.It's the moment one is grasping at straw, that pinprick sliver of eternity when you or your human opponent is struck by total catastrophic disaster, you realise. The fun comes from laughing and crying at misfortune and human suffering.The highs are very high but the lows replicate the feeling of being thrown into a barrel and flung off Niagara Falls.			"

												I like Blood Bowl 2 in some respects.  After investing 70+ hours into the first game, and having played the real life Blood Bowl, I pre-ordered the game.  Played some people online, played the campaign, and more.  There are some things to recommend about the game as well.  The gameplay works as expected, and the graphics are well suited.But there are a few things that irk me.  First of all, the campaign was sold as this major ongoing plotline with new stuff happening.  But it's not.  First of all, the campaign is actually a tutorial.  The first few games don't have certain thigns enabled, and since it takes around an hour to play a game, it's not until 4-5 hours into the game when the campiagn actualyl opens up.  But then it doesn't, becuase many things happen to help you win.  There are things that will kill your foes, and people that will join your squad mid game, and you are almost always given sigifcnat advantages.  Also, as my team increased its BV, the opposing team never got to purchase things to make things a bit more even.  With all of thse advantages (easing into the rules, various things given to you to beat your foes, and no assistance if you outrate your foes, no spirling expenses, etc) I finished the campaign after 15 hours or so, and never conceded a goal.  It was never close.  Therefore, the campaign, a major selling point of BB2 was a total and abject failure.What else?Well, I created some teams, went online, began to get some games on.  Made a league for games vs the AI as well, and even released from the shackles of the campaign, the AI is poor.  It can be severely exploited by knocking players into the crowd, and doesn't learn from mistakes.  If I send one player into the crowd in round two, they should protect the sidelines more later on, but they don't.  While I like that I get both Lizardmen and Wood Elves from launch (Thanks!), games online are getting very repetitve very quickly.  You have a 30% chance of running into an Elf team (if everyone plays all teams equally), and then Skaven are really run-ny fast too.  And then you have a handful of bash teams (Chaos, Dwarf) with some middle of the road teams to finish.  There's very little diversity.  One of the great things about real Blood Bowl, playing on a webiste like Fumbll, or playing in the first BB game from Cyanide is that you can play against enough teams that you never get bored.  You can run into Halflings and Goblins, Undead and Norse, Ogres and Vampires.  The choices for which teams made the cut staggers me a bit.  Why are all three 3 core Elves (only the Pro Elf team is missing) added when not one Undead team is included?  The only good thing here is the new Bretonian Team.  And with games getting very redundant, and with options to head to AI  also so, and with a campaign that was a joke, I simply cannot, in good conscious, recommend this game.Everything that's wrong is fixable.  More teams, fix the campaign or add a real campaign, and such.  But until that happens, Blood Bowl II just can't punch high enough to overcome it's challenges.			"

												Great game and a huge improvement in terms of overall gameplay enjoyment over the last few iterations!Yes, it does have less races than Chaos Edition. But Chaos Edition had no Steamworks, horrible graphics and one of the worst UI's AND tutorials i've ever seen in a video game. So in a nutshell, if you're new to Blood Bowl, this is a great place to start. You'll certainly know how to play the game after you've played the campaign for 5-10 hours or so. After that you probably want to start looking at the online league gameplay and developing your own strategies using information online or by figuring it out yourself or with friends.As for people who actually enjoyed playing Chaos Edition... Err, well, i guess that the game is better if you want the core Blood Bowl experience that's closest to the actual board game but don't care if it's not too great of a video game.			"

Takes ages to      level up if you are on a unlucky batch of dice.. 7) Some of the races seem to squishy then what they should be.. Despite my list of quite a few i would say negitive points or improvements the game allows you to drop in have a few matches,  rage quit at the dice..

												If you cannot handle RNG, this game is not for you! This game has a great strategy element, where both positioning and taking low risk moves before high risk moves is important, but the dice rolls mean anything can happen. This can be both delightful and frustrating at times. Teams trying to play a conventional game of football might have a tough time, against teams who it seems like might be ignoring the ball and really just trying to kill all of your players! But those same conventional teams have great potential for scoring 1 turn touchdowns. Playing a bashing team is definitely recommended.			"

												Decent game coming from the original BloodBowl and there are some minor flaws such as some UI. The game does have a better feel for new players just getting into the Bloodbowl scene. I do wish it was better for old school players to have a semi nostalgic of the original game. Alas I will admit the matchmaking in certain leagues is somewhat unfair but they do help if you have a severe disadvantage by increasing the amount of ingame currency you have to buy certain perks before the game starts.

												Love this game, can't get enough of it! Much better looking and intuitive than the first game and with every release of tweaks and new teams it's just going to get better.There's a lot of negative reviews about how this isn't as complete as the Chaos edition which it isn't, but it is a lot better looking and a lot more immersive as a result and it's only just been released. Considering the amount of time required to build up a good team, 8 quality teams is plenty to keep you occupied until each new one is released at which point there'll be a fresh team to experience and a new reason to start a team from scratch again!I highly recommend this game			"

												It's hard to recommend this game. The gameplay is great and way easier to get into than the first one. But the full game just isn't a good deal. You're paying close to full retail for 8 races/teams. Each team feels different but there aren't enough of them in the base game. Then the extra teams are coming out as DLC, which initially wasn't a big deal but it is when they cost $8 each (and the first two were pretty much day 1 DLC). So for 10 teams you're paying full retail at $60 but the gameâs lack of content just doesn't warrant that. Not to mention it now has micro transactions that shouldnât be there. The campaign is a good way to get familiar with the game and it helps new players learn quite well, albeit slowly. The matchmaking system isn't great if you just want to play a random team, with specific match options. Then new UI is great and the animations are cool but it's just lacking too much content to justify its price (and it's DLC's). Being able to plat a local game is great as playing with someone else on the same PC is really enjoyable. Itâs fun to play and can be picked up by new players that are willing to learn but there isnât enough here to justify the price. The full game price, day one DLC and micro transactions just shouldnât be encouraged. I love you blood bowl but you did this to yourself. "

												Pure dice game. You will get screwed by luck time after time. Its frustrating and demoralising in every aspect. But it has its funny moments. Like if you win your match 3-0 and realise it was your last one because half of your team is injured, or dead, and you cant afford to hire new players... Ok, Maby thats not so funny. Maybe more like; if you loose the match because your player fails to pickup the ball right beneath his feet 3 times in a row... meh... you know, the game has its great moments. Especially if you play it with a friend. But only if you like to see your friends suffer in pain and agony...10/10 if you love your life and wish to hate it.			"

												As a big fan of the original Blood Bowl game I must say that this game really does it justice. It's a major improvement over the first steam game due to how seamless everything feels and the overall beauty of it. Though the game play may seem fickle to some due to the dice mechanic, its just the way the game is meant to feel! I've always had problems with rolling 2 one's in a row while going for a touch down at a criticial moment, and I wouldn't want it any other way.			"

												If you cannot handle RNG, this game is not for you! This game has a great strategy element, where both positioning and taking low risk moves before high risk moves is important, but the dice rolls mean anything can happen. This can be both delightful and frustrating at times. Teams trying to play a conventional game of football might have a tough time, against teams who it seems like might be ignoring the ball and really just trying to kill all of your players! But those same conventional teams have great potential for scoring 1 turn touchdowns. Playing a bashing team is definitely recommended.			"

												Blood bowl 2 is a faithful recreation of the orignal boardgame. This is a game about risk manegment as you bash your way past creative fantasy races to score touchdowns. If you are not a sports fan do not worry this game is actually kind of different from football in a lot of ways and thinking of it as a non football based game will help you because at heart this game is a fantasy game. On problem many people have with this game is that it adds teams as dlc. I understand this critisism but if you pick up the game now the next 2 teams will be free. The teams are well worth the money. You do not need to own a team to play against it so the game has variety being added to keep things fresh. Some teams play in a simmilar way so it is easy to tell whitch teams to pick up. One other big critisism with the game is the diffuculty of learning it. The learning curve is not to bad but it will tak practise to get the game down. This game has an incredibly high skill ceiling so you can always improve. I highly reccomend thiss game.			"

												So I bought this game over a year ago, played it for a little while and tried to return it in frustration. (I was unable to do so, due to the exceptionally long game times.) So now a year later, the bug to play again has bit me and I've given it a try. The interface is still shoddy, glitching at times to select a command other then what you wish (IE. Stand-Up instead of Blitz when your player is on the ground). Icons on the screen bug out and repeat across the screen making it a jumbled mess at times. Finally, unless you customize skill use system, the game becomes just a bunch of random dice.Speaking of dice, lets talk about the RNG of the game. It's utterâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ I have spent, five turns with re-rolls (10 attempts) trying to pick up a ball on a 3+ chance (that's 67% in game terms). I own the board game, this NEVER happens in the board game. Why? Because real dice don't do this. The probability of this happening is so minute that in 25 years of owning the board game I've never seen it happen. But if Cyanide's RNG is to be believed, it happens every game. But only to players. In a player vs player game this happens often, but vs. an AI... Well the AI never suffers such horrendous dice rolling and always gets what it needs. This is called ""Artificial Inflation of Difficulty."" Bad programmers do this rather than find a way to increase the AI's ability to play. It's a short cut used since the days of the Nintendo Entertainment System and Atari. It was used back in those days due to the size constraints on program files being what they were. You couldn't program something that complex because you on had a few MegaBytes or so to fill. This game is over a thousand times larger and more complex. Why resort to such shoddy programming? In the end, if you want to play Blood Bowl, buy the boardgame if you can find it. Or by the original video game, the RNG is still bad but at least you won't feel like you were cheated out of $45-60 for the game plus DLC costs.Don't buy this.			"

												Huge let down.  I've played the first Blood Bowl 324 hours, and I loved it.  It had a few bugs, but it was great.  This new version is a disappointment, but it does have good things: it's nice looking and has awesome slow motion views of the hits.  That's it.And now the bad things.  The user interface (generally speaking) is terrible: in many cases, you canÂ´t tell some positionals apart (eg. dark elf linemen, blitzers, runners) and it's really annoying clicking through all your players to find the one you're looking for...  Then, when you are getting hit, you sometimes don`t know which player it is, making the use of your ability Stand Firm, for example, a game of guessing if you want to use it or not.  And it's terribly annoying to have to put you mouse cursor over every ability icon on the player's stat card to know what abilities he has (why not have it be text like in BB1?). Also when playing, you don't have the sound cues you had in BB1 to know when it's your turn.  It's easy to not realize, the opposing player has finished his turn and the timer is running against you...For some strange reason, you can no longer see your team's stats (or your's as a coach).  You can only see games won.Also, for some strange reason, the rules aren't the same as in the first game (or the tabletop game): human catchers don't have the same stats, you don't have to declare a pass at the begining of the players action, etc.And then: 7â¬ per race?! Come on...Oh, and I'm Spanish but had to change the language to English; the translation is terrible.			"

												I was fine with over paying for what is essentially a HD remake of a game. I was fine with having less features. I was even fine paying for launch and later ""DLC"" which apparently is just teams that were in the base verion of the last game, because it had less of the bugs that was in the last game. But now, after working for two weeks, the game has crashed every multiplayer game I have attempted, which is an automatic conceed. I would rather have the bugs from the first version. At least that way I would be able to try and finish it with the disadvantages. I want to ask for a refund, and possibly rebuy it when they get theirâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥together, but apparently that time has past for me.Stick to the first version and don't buy this halfâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥relaunch attempt until they fix it and put the rest of the teams in.

												1st off i love warhammer, i play the table top, the video games, and read the books so im slighly bias.BUT OFF THE TO REVIEW!I was completely new to the blood bowl, and i heard it had a steep learning curve, so before i bought it i watched some gameplay vids to get an idea of the tactics. When i got the game i was shocked by how well the tutorial campaign is. They introduces you to the game bit by bit. 1st level there is no rolls, 2nd there are rolls but no turn overs, 3rd there are turn overs, 4th gives u all features but no injuries, etc. they gradually introduce u so its not all thrown at u at once. now once u  u get to the 5th level the campaign sucks because its no longer winning, its dumb objectives like, cripple 5 enemy players.....well that becomes a game of chance with dice rolls. BUT the game isnt about the capaign is about online.Online is great, make your team, customize it (i would like more customizing features please), hire players and staff, etc. If a player dies hes gone for good, injured players can be out for a few games....it feels like running a real team. ITs also super smooth and all the teams strengths and weaknesses are clearly displayed.  over all i say its a good game but matches take at least an hour, so be prepared.			"

												While the game is hampered by several technical issues, like the lack of a fullscreen option as well as occasional issues that can cause a low framerate performance (usually solved by ensuring it is not running on the in built graphics card or checking the compatability box in preferences), Blood Bowl 2 has managed to begin sucking up quite a few hours of my life. The initial selection of races was small, but if the upcoming DLC (Free for many players) is of any sign, we will start seeing old favorites popping up in the future.The gameplay is unforgiving, what with Nuffle being a fickle little jerk, and can cause you to howl in agony when a player just needed to pick the damn ball up but apparently that was too much to ask! Or feel like literally cheering as a risky play pays off and steals you the win. The themes of old fantasy meets american football in an over the top comedic world is a lot of fun, and the commentators quite a few good lines worth of a chuckle. In short, if your dying for a different flavor of turn based strategy and don't mind a bit of tinkering and the need for a windowed screen, then give Blood Bowl 2 a try, but I can hardly blame anyone of these obsticles impede their ability to enjoy the game.With that said, wheres our sodding Amazon team!?

Its also very satisfying to kill a player on the opponent's team or multiple players for that matter.  I would not recommend playing with loved ones tho as it did end up getting me hit in real life for killing one of her players.			"

												I've been playing BB since the tabletop game, and this is an almost perfect translation (and the imperfections will only be noticed by the very hardcore). The graphics and UI are much improved from Chaos Edition, and that alone made the purchase worthwhile for me. As long as you understand that this is a turnbased tactical game, and in no way an action game, it's a can't miss 9/10.			"

												Decent Blood Bowl game. If you are new you will enjoy it as there is a good tutorial to get you going and the UI is very clear and chances are now displayed in %.For veterans:1.) Certain Skills are missing (Like Pass Block)2.) 7(+2 DLC) of the 24 official races are playable, the unofficial Brettonians are included3.) Lots of balance changes to stats of players and some rules are rewritten (Inducements, Bank Rule @150k Gold)4.) Small Bugs with certain skills (can't blitz with stab)5.) Lots of Star Players are missing6.) Aging in a different form is introduced			"

												Be patient people, all the pieces are falling into place for this small development house, that has a knack for nice details and excellent atmosphere building.For those of us who have been patient through lengthy release delays to a 95% finished produce I can tell you these facts:1) FOR the vast majority of us, this is a far more stable and enjoyable platform than BB1 which was excellent but technically flawed2) You get enough races at launch, really, since the whole experience is richer and deeper now (you can get more personal with your team and customize it) the launch kit is enough3) The UI is a brilliant improvement... and I mean both the in-game UI and the menus - if the test of a good UI is that you don't notice it until you find yourself charmed by esthetics, then this one passess brilliantly4) All the races have been a bit tweaked, the game seems better balanced now... I have had basically 9 our of 10 (I have played around 20 so far) fantastically fun games with people from the US, Europe, New Zealand and South Korea.... only a couple of disatisfied wining dolts as in in multiplayer community have been unpleasant, but even that is handled well by Cyanide5) Connection and stability is MUCH better to BB16) THIS game is an ultimate strategy game with heavy reliance on dice! But the dice require a strategy of their own since they have a massive impact... the beauty of Blood Bowl is that nothing is certain, not even that 100% sure touchdown, where you are almost there.If you are an intelligent, patient, strategy game player who wants to be massively entertained do not hesitate to pay out for this not-overpriced release (the engine makes i worthwile in my opinion)			"

												If you ever played the tabletop version then you will enjoy this, the campaign is more of a tutorial and has its comedy moments with the comedy aspect of the ogre and vampire broadcasters.This game shines when playing multiplayer in leagues with friends there is lots of open leagues as well as lots of youtubers and streamers leagues. there is a large online community for it too. Downside of the cam is chunky, some times you feels that RNG does troll you and if you the controll system some times will autopath slightly differently than what you wanted and wil not display the Go for its or dodge %, but if i play with a bit of practice the gui some times does not instant update. hope they have some more sound or actions dlc to add the gamethanks			"

												7/10 - Good game, but could (and should) have been even better.Visually, the game is stunning.  The models and animations are superbly crafted, the indicators for tackle zones and movement allowances looks far more appealing than in Blood Bowl 1, and it's generally very clear to see what's happening on the pitch.  The game itself is a lot of fun.  There's a good amount of depth in strategy and tactics, and the variety in the available races makes every game feel different, yet still familiar.  The tutorial is a decent enough way to learn the basics of the game, and if you name your players then you have a real emotional connection to them, whether they're killing the opposing team's Big Guy or failing to pick up the ball for the third time in a row.  It makes the whole thing just that little bit more personal.But it also has its problems.  When it comes to graphics choices, with the exception being able to turn off grass and/or spectators for fps gains, you are limited to a selection from 'low' to 'very high', with no explanation given to what these mean.  There's no way to know how detailed the shadows are, or how much antialiasing each setting uses.  For a modern PC game, this is sub-par at best.This lack of meaningful options also extends into other areas of the game.  Veterans of Blood Bowl will want to be able to choose which skills they activate manually and which kick in automatically, but no such option exists.  Simplicity is very much at the core of Cyanide's design ethos for Blood Bowl 2, even at the expense of expected functionality.The interface is very much designed for consoles, with lots of scrolling left to right instead of either up and down or using drop-down boxes.  This is most irritating when selecting saved formations.  You have to cycle through them one by one, and if you're too slow then you have to wait while your team reorganises itself on the pitch before you can select the next formation.  It's unnecessarily clunky and slow.Speaking of being unnecessarily slow, repositioning individual players before the game kicks off now requires you to wait until they run into position before you can select the next player to move.  This makes setting up a formation player-by-player take far longer than it needs to.  The display for showing how many dice you will roll against an opponent also requires a short hover time now, instead of popping up immediately.  Again, it's not gamebreaking but it gets irritating.Finally, control of the camera is often taken away from you on your opponent's turn.  Cyanide have decided that your opponent's players will take centre stage, whether you want them to or not.  It doesn't matter whether you can already see them well enough, or if you would rather look at another area of the pitch to plan your next move.  No.  Bad you.  Little Scruffy moving 3 squares is far more important than that.  Look at him.  NOW!I'm also experiencing a lot of crashes, though I will note that I seem to be very much in the minority on that issue.  But even having followed the advice of uninstalling and reinstalling graphics card drivers, turning off all possible programs, and even reinstalling the game itself, I still get dumped out of the client on a regular basis.But despite all this, I still have a lot of fun with the game.  I would definitely recommend it to people who want to get into Blood Bowl.  Veterans, however, may find that the differences between BB2 and BB1 are sufficient to play the older game, particularly with the reduced team roster (currently 10 teams available).			"

That being said i wouldn`t recomment it if you are a litte ragequiter and can`t handle a loss. The game is not that easy from a tactical standpoint. you will get destroyed till you find your the best race matching your playstyle. would buy again.			"

I played Blood Bowl Chaos Edition for 35 hours and then played Blood Bowl 2, all of it in the last one week. Blood Bowl 2 is definitely superior except for one thing- there are only a 7-8 races available. The rest you have to buy. But other than that Blood Bowl 2 is definitely suprerior in a number of ways. The UI is much better. Graphics are vastly improved. My most favourite feature is Cabal TV, where one can watch replays of games played by other players in the community. A lot of multiplayer games tend to miss out on this feature and I am glad it was implemented here. And yes it is leaning towards multiplayer competitive online play. There are single player competitions you can create against the AI if you like. But the main fun is joining one of the open leagues and playing human opponents.The game may not be worth $49 for the lack of content in the form of races to play but I bought it on sale (yes its on sale already!) and its a bargain for that price. Dont be in doubt! Buy it!			"

												A reminder that this game is turned based, not real time and can be brutal when you first start without practice but I still reccomend this game regardless. Dont let how the game plays discourage you from picking it up and trying it out though as the game can be fun, hilarious and anger inducing especially with how the percenatges can work!It takes alot of getting used to regarding playstyles, rules and of course the classic RNG moments but this is a great game to play online with randoms and friends! All that you might need is a good enough PC to run the game but even on low quality the game is fine as I'm more interested in the gameplay itself! Pick up this game if you havent, get training, take your skills onto the bloodbowl pitch and lead your team to victory!BLOOD BOWL 2 !!!			"

												To sumirze the game in one sentence.. well, 3- stebs back 1 steb foward, it improves the core in the game yet makes the dawrfs only race that is certain to survie, Skaven become almost unplayable if you want to go far with your team not to mention the irritations within the game, constant need for some odd connection to X or Y , Camera issues... and very few races are planned DLC  "

												Once again the game known as Blood Bowl didn't cease to surprise me. Now this game is of course better looking and has the same amount of luck needed. You want to run after the ball roll a one and die? no? happend to me. What i am saying basically adds up to this, This game with another race or two would be 9/10 since the race variety i find a bit small but knowing the devs sure they will add more soon. So support the devs and yourself and buy the game its pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fun.			"

												Without ever playing the table top game, it feels like a board game.  The dice rolls make nothing a sure thing, but the rules and abilities give it depth.

												I really wanted this to be an improvement to the first game(s), but so far, only the graphics have improved. The AI and player customisation are actually worse.8 races is not enough for a varied experience. I'm sure more teams will be added as DLC down the line, but releasing a game at full price and adding essential elements for more money is just not okay.Note: I have not had a look at multiplayer yet. General comments on the AI: - The AI still doesn't know what turn it is. It'll risk players Going For It to get closer to the End Zone in turn 8 or 16, even with no chance of scoring. - If the AI manages to pick up the ball in an opponent Tackle Zone, they'll stop moving. No atttempts to dodge out.- The AI will dodge out of the enemy ball carrier's TZ in order to make irrelevant blitzes or assists elsewhere. - The setup is randomised. Yes, really. The AI doesn't set up according to your setup, it just picks a random formation. Furthermore, setting up your players is a very slow and dull affair; you have to wait for each player to run to the designated spot, one at a time. There is no need for this whatsoever.- The AI really likes standing (or setting up) next to the sidelines. Jim and Bob are talking about why this is a really bad idea, but apparently, the AI programmers didn't listen to them. On that note, Jim and Bob look like they've been dubbed from another language; their mouth movements are just generic animations that go on while they're talking.- Even with the improved graphics, it's harder to tell the difference between the players. The only difference between players in the same position is the head. With identical helmets, this does very little to make them stand apart.I am very disappointed. :/			"

												While the gameplay more or less copies the miniature game, Blood Bowl 2 is in many ways a step back from the first PC version of Blood Bowl. The graphics are better overall...but with surprisingly little diversity. The initial release had a very small number of teams, and even though they've added more since, all teams share the same human cheerleaders. There are a few stadium options, but still less than half as many as there are teams. The nature-loving wood elves would have to play in the fancy-schmancy high elf stadium. The Chaos beastmen could either play in a rat town or a dark elf shrine, neither of which fits thematically. There are too few head models to avoid duplication on one team. Turns take so long with moving players around that the game feels ill-suited for multi-player, but the options for a single-player vs. computer campaign are worse than the original Blood Bowl. ""Campaign mode"" is essentially just an extended tutorial. In general, the level of detail and immersion is about where regular American football video games were in the 1980s. On net, it's still sort of fun to play, but it's hard to shake the pervasive sense that it's not a finished product and the experience is unfulfilling because of it. Winning isn't as fun as it should be because at the end of the day it just feels like a miniatures game without the miniatures.			"

												I played this game for a long time and really enjoyed it. The problem is that one day I forgot my in game password. So I clicked the ""retrive password"" button. Thinking it would send my password to me by email, but instead it reset my account. I lost all of my progress and all the hours I put in. I dont want to grind back to where I was. So I am quiting.Also the game is heavily flawed on public leagues. The only viable option at high team value is choas or nurgle because they get so much claw. They are also probaly the teams that are the least fun to play against and play. Those teams allow for very little counter play, unlike necro, skaven, and any elf team.I think for now the game is not worth the fifty dollar price. It cost much more to get all the dlc teams and with legendary edition coming out they will probaly cost more. So for the full game you could be playing 90. I don't think that this game is worth it. If you want a funny stradegy game to play with your friends play xcom 1 with mods.			"

Correction! Singleplayer kind of hidden, campaign is really bad / TL;DR at the endthe whole review is rewritten after another player pointed out a terrible mistake I madeSo lads, I played Blood Bowl 1 a lot and I played already a good bunch of Blood Bowl 2 Multiplayer.I love Blood Bowl, I love every single aspect of an ACTUAL blood bowl match. You get exactly this by choosing Play In A League.However if you were here to play campaign... he...hehe....well enjoy playing with humans only.If you're new to the game, please get somewhere blood bowl 1, do the tutorial in there and then play blood bowl 2 singleplayer/multiplayer. DO NOT expect ANYTHING from the campaign. You apparently can't pick races (it forced me to play humans) and after the third match I was fedup with the super slow approach they offer here. Third match and the actually interesting features of blood bowl are still missing and will maybe show up in the fourth match.However I lost my patience to even try it.If you just want to play a campaign with some generated story or whatever you expect, I suggest wait until the devs realize what is wrong or introduce a proper campaign mode. Meanwhile, enjoy what the game is about and play leagues. (I suggest multiplayer)If you already bought the game and you only want to play campaign, Give multiplayer a chance. It's worth it and shows the spirit of Blood Bowl!To the devs: If you really introduce players to this game with a ""Campaign"" (Tutorial) which at the third match doesn't even show half the actual rules, you were probably drunk when one of your game designers presented it to you. Or he's a really good friend and no one dared telling him that it's a bad idea. Some players might loose their patience and don't even get beyond the third match and just give up on the game, as it feels incomplete when playing the so called ""campaign"". Do something about it before it's too late. Especially about the fact how hidden the soloplayer mode is!Here a guide on how to get to the singleplayer, before you start the same flamewars I attended to start in the original post- Go to Team & League Management- Create a team as you desire it!- Now go back to the mainscreen and click Play In A League- Select your team- Click in the bottom right corner Join A League- Choose Solo- I let you figure out the rest, you found it now anyway :)TL;DR:If you want a better tutorial, I suggest playing Blood Bowl 1If you bought Blood Bowl 2 already but you want to exclusively play singleplayer... possible, but don't confuse the so called ""Campaign"" with the singleplayerMultiplayer is awesomePlay the multiplayer!If you only consider playing singleplayer, give multiplayer a try, it's just more fun and doesn't matter that your team loses players in single or multiplayer. Eitherway, dead is dead.I'm complaining a lotI actually read some replies "

												Blood Bowl 2... oh man, what a game it is and a wonderful one at that too!So what is it?Well it is the digital version of the Table Top game called Blood Bowl of American football set in a Warhammer fantasy setting where murder is appriciated.It is a very complex game so it can be a bit daunting at first glance but it is a hell'a'lot of fun and the UI and tooltips are clean and clear as to what each thing does even if it takes a bit of time to fully understand everything.Think of it as a strategy game where your opponent's most lethal weapon is you screwing things up - it is a risk management system relying on RNG to do most things; yes, just walking a bit too far (doing a so called 'Go for it' - going additional squares outside of one's own movement range) requires of you to roll a dice to see if your character dies or not and this is how you play the game for the most part - reduce risk as much as you can and prepare for worst case scenarios.Going onto the buisness model:Alot of people aren't going to like it but here's what has been done, Cyanide puts the standard game out for a set price and you get 8 races with that. After that instead of doing what they have done in the past to re-release the game again for the same price, they will sell the different races as DLC so you can handpick exactly the ones that you want (don't worry - as a new player you get all the races you need from the start to play a ball game, a punching game or a pretty standard well balanced team that can pack a bit of a punch and pass around the ball at the same time; YOU DO NOT NEED ANY ADDITIONAL RACES TO ENJOY THE GAME this is for when one is more experienced and wishes to dedicate more time and money to the game) for a reasonable price.Can I recommend the game? The game seems to be without any glaring bugs that made it darn difficult to enjoy Blood Bowl 1 Chaos and Legendary Edition, the UI is clear as a blue sunny day, the gameplay inputs feels responsive and direct (no excessive amount of clicking necessary as this games uses a mouse and keyboard in other words), excellent models and amazing graphics...I will say this much: this is a good time to be a Blood Bowl fan or someone who's interested in Blood Bowl as I can full heartedly say that this is an EXCELLENT digital version of Blood Bowl! If you like management games but just wished you could punch that annoying fellah' who makes it more annoying... welcome to Blood Bowl where the ball is a secondary objective (still required to score to win tho') and punching people to death is a fun and viable tactic!Get the game! xD			"

												Someone needs to teach Cyanide what the meaning of entropy is because its apparent that this game does not implement any of it in its rolling function.  Its literally laughable how nonrandom it is in its roll results.  Its an epic fail second only to the poor match making that results in a higher level team decimating your squad through injuries, literally breaking it to the point of non recovery. You will purchase this game and rage quite within 10-20 matches.  Sadly it could have been a lot fun and solid to play if they just let random be random rather then the crap they produced with all the rule changes from the board game.  Its simply not enjoyable in its current state.  I wish I could return it. Pass.So after additional time in game(80+ hours) my review stands...this game is trash, steer clear.update:installed agin to see if anything had changed...nope, still trash.  When the rolling of a game can be so one sided that 10 player out of a 13 player team are eaither injured or KOed all with armor 8 or better...you know something is broken.  Whats worse is when all of the other teams (2) KOs come back and not 1 of the 5 on the other team recover...By the way this is an undead team...to even get 5 injured past regeneration rolls is obsurd.Deleted this game once and for all...will never return to this trash.

												I never played the previous and I'm loving this.  I started with the 1 week early release so didn't have the campaign to teach me the game, so it was rough playing against other players.  Once release occurred the campaign would have been amazing to teach me the game (how to move, how to block, pass, score).I've played against the AI a bit and found it ok (defintiely nice since you can actually pause!) and a lot in NAF until I started hitting 2000 TV with a few teams.  Now I'm starting to try out leagues and I'm having a blast.  I'm in 2 leagues and it's amazing the different type of game.This game comes HIGHLY recommended by me.			"

												I do recommend this game for BB fans. 7/10The game is great, it's easier however to list what it lacks as opposed to what it has so I'll keep this simple.It lacks animation and cut scene variety. (no big deal when you turn them off anyway)It lacks all teams (which as a pre orderer I still have not gotten my wood elves and as an owner of every previous title we get no credit towards future teams)It lacks a grid system which Chaos Edition had.To all the naysayers yes I agree a game should be complete on release date but sadly we live in a different time now. I personally think the game was released about 2-3 months too early but I think it's playable and enjoyable. "

												While I would have liked to see Cyanide move a little further from the tabletop game (leveling up players happens to intermitantly and some will not get into situations to earn spp) and gear the game more for the computer.  The campaign is a big improvement providing a gentle intro and bit of flavour and i quickly got used to the new ui (though it took a little adjustment), I never played multiplayer on past versions but this time round i will at least be dipping a toe in the waters.

												If you play this game, know that you will come to know despair. Blood Bowl is basically Football except with violence and murder (plus Orks and Elves andâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. You make a team of 11 players (giving them all unique names) and fight against other people. You knock over enemy players, you grab the ball, pass the ball and hopefully score and win. After the game, you get skill points for your players and level them up. But here's the thing: When your players get tackled or hit or just generally â¥â¥â¥â¥ up, they have a chance of getting an injury or dying. This injury or death is permenant. You may go into a game with 13 players and come out with 10. Or 9. Or 8. An injury might cause your star player might come out with a permenant unremovable stat point loss. And this handicap will persist FOREVER. And the best part? If the dice and RNG are against you, there's absolutely nothing you can do about it. A tiny level 1 Goblin can kill a giant level 5 troll on the first turn if the dice are with it. Every Blood Bowl team is thus a ticking time bomb that's just one game away from being destroyed forever. My High Elf team is 13-2-3 and riding high, but I know very well that the day will come. The day when I roll double 1's on a block and use a reroll to get another set of double 1's. The day when one of my Blitzers will fail an 83% success rate dodge and immediately die. The day my most valuable player is killed by a Turn 16 spite foul by some bitter Russian I just swept 4-0. I know that it'll happen. Perhaps it's that thrill of going against certain doom that makes Blood Bowl a thrilling affair. But regardless, until that day comes, I'm enjoying the game quite a bit.			"

												DO. NOT. BUY. THIS.I was interested in it from a few videos, saw it on sale and said hey why not? Ignored the mostly negative reviews I foolishly bought it anyway. and played over 2 hours. I hope you like neverending BS and bad RNG every single game. The playerbase is also tiny, so you'll be going up against the same OP chaos team multiple times. And if you want to play a team on chaos level that isn't chaos? Sorry the best teams like lizardmen and wood elves are behind a paywall! (Spoilers, everyone plays chaos/lizard/welves they are broken as hell!) At most if you think it looks cool, watch some videos. Game isn't worth a dime, and the devs seem intent on being as un-userfriendly as possible with day one DLC as well in in-game mico-transaction currency.Avoid, avoid, avoid! Do not waste your money on this trash!			"

I logged a lot of hours in the last edition of digital Blood Bowl- and I will say it led to me taking up tabletop again.

												So far one of the best board game styled games I've played. It's simple in presentation but complex in depth the longer you play and learn. The game does require some practice and understanding the basic concepts (play styles, risk management, skill focus) but in the longrun it is an amazing game. Even then there is a lot more to experience as some skills can completely change how the game rules follow (IE: Mutations are crazy, Pass is inaccurate but catcher still catches it so no turnover, and much more). Games are generally 30 minutes and if your playing in a League it becomes really fun to play against other player's play styles and concepts. The game is partially based on the dice for everything, the rest is how you manage or deal with your options. I recommend this game if you want to see some violence, savvy skill, or just for the LoLs; it's a great game that is only getting better.			"

												Blood Bowl 2 brings the warhammer lore into a silly turn based sports/strategy management game that is surprisingly addictive. The graphics are beautiful, the game comes chock full lore just for the bloodbowl universe, and Bob and Jim the announcers are fun to listen to. The negative for me comes with the massive reliance on luck or dice rolls for this game. You will be surprised how often you can roll a 1 (for me the record is 21 consecutive rolls) and how devastating it can feel. Like the announcer Jim says ""they got the advantage, but there is no sure thing in Bloodbowl""The only other minor issue I had was the lack of customization involved. As this is a digital version of a Warhammer game I suppose I expected total customization on my characters colors as though I would paint them in real life. Unfortunately you have to choose from the colors they have avaiable, or buy some from the shop with actual money.  "

												Now, I know there is many a person here that will go ""Blood Bowl 1 has more content and is therefore better.""But if you wait one Nuffle-Damn minute and have a look at both these games, they are honestly stellar examples of something to do in your spare time. Blood Bowl 1 has more content, and more pitches, races, etc, however this game has a less-obstructive UI (Those used to BB1's may argue but I feel this is so much easier to access), better graphics (no reason to call it a better game of course, I hate this argument but I know there are some out there that really care), easier-to-manage leagues and teams, and constant updates. Hell, I'm writing this before the undead release and finding myself genuinely hyped for those zombified little blockers. The point being, sure, if you want loads of teams and accuracy to whatever edition of Blood Bowl it was (I haven't played the figurine version, on a student budget I sadly cannot afford these luxuries), go buy Blood Bowl 1. It's honestly an amazing game. If you want a more modern retake on it, which can be arguably considered better or worse (go buy them both and find out if you really want, they're worth it) get this game. And even if you don't really like it as much, you can still have quite a lot of fun with it. Oh, and if you're new to all this there is an incredibly steep learning curve and a lot of luck (but also a lot of skill, Nuffle in his almighty wisdom tries to keep this even) but it's worth the few hours learning for the fun you can have. So go buy it (preferably on sale, but if you're a rabid goblin who cannot wait for a few weeks then go ahead), have fun, and ruin your friend's hours of time by killing their best players.P.S.

												Blood Bowl 2 is an amazing and very polished game. If you like turn-based strategy games with campaign modes that allow you to build up your team members, such as XCOM, you will love BB2. Your players earn xp by injuring other players or scoring touchdowns, allowing them to add skills when they level up. A real part of the magic is that each time a player levels, you roll dice to see which skill trees you're able to choose from. This results in many players having very unique and situationally powerful skills which allow you to employ and explore interesting and divirgent tactics on the play field.If you're turned off by sports games, don't let that dissuade you from BB2. At it's core, it's a tactical turn-based combat game with rich team and player progression. Random tips:- Be wary of reviews and review scores for BB2. A small group of die-hard Games Workshops fanboys were upset that the developer didn't make BB2 exactly the game they wanted. They're making a coordinated attempt to drive down the review scores of the game. - After 75+ hours, I've had no crashes, encountered no bugs, and had no other issues. - The interface is perfectly fine and I've had no trouble finding everything I need. (the registration button for leagues threw me off the first time, but once I realized I had to click on ""Registration"" it was fine)- BB2 is hard core. There are no save games. Players can and will get permanent injuries and can and will die. If they die, they're dead. It's refreshingly awesome.- The multiplayer online play is amazing. Join the official league (22k members currently) with a new team and you'll be matched with a random opponent. The games move fast, with a play timer that seems just about right.- Solo multiplayer is also great way to learn the game and start building up a team. - BB2 is a tough and challenging game. If you're having trouble, consider starting a Dwarf team.- The single-player campaign is meh. I'd recommend skipping it entirely unless you're into that sort of thing.The GW fanboy mudslinging campaign aside, BB2 is overall and amazing game and, in my opinion, a serious contender for game of the year.

												As some one who is new to the computer version (played tableop many moons ago), I have enjoyed what I have played of the campaign so far. I have always felt the previous versions were confusing in what version to purchase so I have left the, alone.I can understand the critism of many fans with lack of content and DLC, but because they have ported it to consoles they need to pick up newer fans. As a grizzly old gamer I am  generally not a nig fan of DLC, but this is GW here who love to grab  as money from fans as possible. I am now looking forward to playing some multiplayer now, just like in old days as a teenager.No matter what price companies charge, or amount of content they produce, people will always moan and wait till games are dirt cheap. Then on the other hand moan about the lack of niche titles and companies are just producing mass marketed titles.			"

												Do not buy this game.The Pros - the physicality, animations, the feeling of luckThe Negatives - lack of customisation for players, there are balance changes that need to be made between the races and 3 huge negatives that destroy the game are the following:1. They have not made the game to prevent people from ""idling"" near YOUR end zone (where they can score) and as a result preventing you from starting again in the center (so you can attack), so the enemy can simply win by waiting  near the end zone and you never even get the chance to START with the ball.2. The team value number is so broken, that you can have 400 extra value simply because you have 3 extra skills and 1 extra player for your entire team, the result? the result is that you  are queued against new teams (team value 1000) and that gives them gold, enough gold for a star player or wizard, the result? You will lose unless you are extremely extremely extremely lucky with the dye for the ENTIRE GAME.3. If you lose the match, you usually get NO POINTS AT ALL FOR YOUR TEAM, NONE AT ALL, unless you injure someone. So you play for 1 entire hour, to lose and gain no points at all. Fix this atrocity.DO you still really believe that the gold part is fair? Check out the undead race - you can have 2 mummys (each has 5 stre) and ramfut (has 5 or 6 stre with 4 or 5 movement allowance) - Not overpowered enough?Do not buy this game till the above 3 things are resolved. Pss. I don't think that they will ever be resolved.			"

												Okay, so people will dislike this review because it's pretty negative.Games Workshop understands table top gaming. They know what goes into rules construction, game design, advancement methodology. But table top games don't always translate well to computer games when you make it literal.REMOVE THE SIX-SIDED DIE. It isn't accurate, it isn't honest, it isn't true, period, the end, so long, goodbye, we're done. There are too many interconnected pieces of design, too many items that need to be weighed for this to possibly be accurate. That die is weighted, with intention, in order to reflect the other character additions of opposing teams. So stop pretending some random shmuck is going to have a 1/6 chance to get a 6 and rough up an 1800 team rank. It's complete garbage. I played 8 games as various low-level teams, maxing at maybe 1050 or so. I played another 8 games in the 1400 or so rank, and well, I declare, my rolls dramatically changed. There was a teensy tweak of strategy, but that's about it.Remove the die. It makes people think they actually have a decent chance on plays they don't. Use a counter, a dial, something that goes to 100. That die is the most infuriating thing about this game - so infuriating, that yeah, I will give an awful review, because it acts as a carrot but is really just a big stick. Fix the die, remove the die, replace it with something that makes sense IN A COMPUTER GAME. This is a statistical game, make it some blue LED powered by Bloodweiser.I'll likely continue trying to get better at this game, though the learning curve is not crazy, because it can be fun. But like cake, the die is a lie.After this little deception is the artwork, which in general is great. But many times, too many times, due to the artwork meant to warn users of potential pitfalls (such as multiple dodge warnings) being opaque, they'll be hidden behind one another. You may be willing to risk an 83% dodge chance, but it's hiding a 17%. And that's when all the warnings actually appear. To say nothing of the dice rolls glitching and not displaying. This isn't a ""bad"" game, but it's definitely still a buggy one.			"

												This game would be great, if only you could turn off the slow, boring animations. It has tactical depth, good role-play elements, and an art style that appeals to me. Unfortunately, it takes maybe 2-3 times longer to play a match than it should because youre stuck watching the same boring, agonizingly sow animations play out again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again... Virtually every other turn based game ever made gives you the option of turning unit animations off because it slows the game down so much as to be unplayable. I like Blood Bowl 2. I really want to play it, but i just dont have the time or the attention span to sit through hours upon hours of boring filler animations.The developer and fanboys are lying to your face. You can only turn off ""CUT-SCENES"", NOT ANIMATIONS. This only stops the camera from zooming in on the animations, but instantaneous movement (as can be found in civ, endless legend, and HoMM) is impossible in this game. STOP LYING			"

												This is nothing more than a reskin of Blood Bowl: Chaos edition.  Sure, the interface has improved *slightly*, but using skills can actually be more cumbersome.There are less teams, and any further teams that are going to be added are going to be DLC that you have to purchase.Worst of all is that the Random Number Generator is just as â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ in this as it was in their previous 3 editions of Blood Bowl.  Unless you are rolling blocking dice, expect to fail about 30% to 40% of the rolls.Complete waste of money considering I already had the Chaos Edition.  Even worse was that I had to pay extra to play my favourite team:  Wood Elves.â¥â¥â¥â¥ Cyanide, I am done with their â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ games.			"

												An 83% chance on a ""Go For it"" means chance of sucess, right?  Then why does it feel more like a chance for failure?I want to like this game FAR MORE than I do.  I want to LOVE this game.  I want to write a review that says ""You should go out and buy this game NAOW! o 3o ""...  BUT...The RNG (Random Number Generator, used for dice rolls in this game) will make you rage something awful.  This game is in an AWFUL need of a rebalance.  And I don't mean the rules that the mechanics of the game follow.  I mean the fact that the AI habitually gets far better rolls than you do and does so on a consistant basis.  I mean that the Lizardman race is OP.  And this isn't the only beef I have.Positives:+ Decent Graphics+ possibility of carnage on the field+ For some reason, I keep coming back to the game....Cons:- Emotionally dead cheerleader clones.- RNG HATES YOU!!- Where are the Amazonians and Valkyries?  You have icons for them in game and yet NO WORD on release date or even if you're planning to release them? - RNG HATES YOU!!Honestly, my main, heart breaking complaint is how unfair the RNG is.  I know it doesn't sound like much, but when EVERY ASPECT of the game hinges on it?  It becomes a gamebreaker.  When I'm failing 8 out of 10 rolls that have a 83% chance of success, that is NOT a chance of success!  And I use this as an example, but there are FAR MORE examples in the game.  Players can talk all they like about positioning, skills and what not.The only winning move is not to play.I would recommend this game ONLY in the vain , vain hope that the RNG is addressed in the future (which is NOT likely) and that the races I am looking forward to make it to the game SOON (as of this moment, 3 new races have been announced, but none of them are Amazonian or Valkyries)For now... get this game on sale, if you must.

												Pros:- it plays like Blood BowlCons:- interface is absolutely atrocious (made for a gamepad, thus megaclutter, either huge icons or microscopic text for action selection, forget about dropdown menus/scrolllists etc)- gimped team editor (especially the inability to create a team with any amount of points just to properly try out each race - like it was possible before)- inability to save the game during the match in SP, not even during kickoffs. And if for some reason you have to stop playing in the middle of the game - the game will be considered automatically lost and there's no way to replay the match. Yeah that means you auto-lose in whole leagues.- no fullscreen (seriously) thus quite possibly worse performance- graphics settings are almost non-existent (overall detail level + grass and that's it)- combat looks way duller - surrounding teammates do not throw punches anymore when close to the attacked player. Cutscenes for combat get old fast (a single animation per player class) so they don't help. Even minor thing like running across the touchdown line when you have moves left before scoring is out - it's instascore.- there are only human cheerleaders, thus no race specific ones and their number does not depend on how many your team has- only 5 stadiums. You can upgrade them visually, making them bigger - but since camera controls are gimped (only zoom in) you can't even check them out right. And since all of them are covered with the same grass - you can't even tell them apart most of the time.- only 8 races. Yeah I know it's a total remake with completely new assets yet the fact remains - Chaos Edition has 23. And 10 stadiums.Basically - avoid until fixed (if ever) and get at a 50% discount.TL;DR: WHAT THE F-			"

												i should of also mentioned this, immideatly disregard any negetive review based on the campaign or single player experience,,this is NOT a single player game and that is nothing more then a baby step tutorial to introduce the newest  of new players to the concepts of the game. if you like RTS ,board games or strat games in general i would also recomend you ignore any review with very short playing times,as there usually people who havent really learned the game to give it a chance. remember 1single game takes 30-60mins, so there the same people who dont know how to play risk ,chess, monopoly, sorry, yahtzee, checkers or tic tac toe even but know they dont like them. anyone i have ever met that i knew was a board/strat gamer that i intorduced any version of bloodbowl to has joined the fold and really liked it once they got the hang of it.  its also one of those games you may take a break from,,but u alwayse are backwhen reading the negative reviews you will see alot of those posts go somthing like wah wah i tried this and it dident work, wah i tried that and it dident work,RNG#@%@ and then they claim the game is all crap rng. if you have 20 games played and have really bad luck and dice 1 game ok, but if its your first cupple games and nothing worked, and your dice rolls failed, chances are you got outplayed and were forced into situations that created the risy moves even if they were low risk, that eventually messed you up! im not saying alwayse but usually.

												First off this is a 20 dollar game not a 44.99 game.  he price point is INSANE for what they have to offer.Want to see the grid like bb chaos edition?nopeWant to see your player names or xp etc to help you see what player you have where?nopeWant to be able to easily tell players apart?NopeWant to get inducements before you spend to much money on team or go back and fourth easily to construct your team?nopeWant to not have the game forget to display a dodge you have to make?NopeWant see your opponents team before you buy inducements because he has a higher value team?NopeWant league play to mean anything?  I mean anything at all?Nope (18-0 first place, dude that has 35-1 20th.. ummhmm).Want to see detailed stats on your players (blocks, injuries, scores)?NopeI could go on but i'm tired.  This is a downgrade from bloodbowl chaos edition.  They only upgrade is the graphics are a little better and they have an online component.  And honestly, zoom in to your characters to see just how crappy the skins really are.  Hair is one piece that doesn't move a clips, skin is just wierd when zoomed in, players do not really look much different (dwarves in particular), player doesn't look any different as he levels up.On a steam sale for 20 bucks this is a solid buy.  for 44.99 no way it is worth it.

												While the graphics are terrific and the gameplay itself is fun to watch, there are multiple issues around actually PLAYING the game itself. I won't go over the issues with multiplayer as they are better described in other reviews. I want to focus on the ""single player"" game.  I have played Blood Bowl the board game since second edition.  I am a Wood Elf player and was really looking forward to practicing with the solo league play. The problem is that the AI is so unbalanced that it is beyond broken. In my first four games, my team has suffered FOUR deaths! I have seen repeated successes for the AI on rolls of 33% or less while receiving a losing streak of no less than 8 fails on rolls having an 83% chance of success. And this is after I started tallying rolls for both sides.  I happen to HATE games where unbalanced die rolling compensates for lazy AI coding. It is quite obvious this was to be a multiplayer only experience as it is equally obvious they gave the AI coding minimal effort.  DO NOT BUY! Instead wait for the 5th Edition to be released by Games Workshop later this year and play the game it was meant to be played.*edited for typos*			"

												The game is not ready by any stretch of the imagination. Horrible interface, really thin campaign mode, lack of features in-game such as useful stadium upgrades and sponsors that do anything. Not to mention the awful server issues that causes you to lose everything you gained from hour long matches. Even if you manage to level up players in your team, you need to beg that you'll get connection with the server back, or else you'll have to start all over again.Why even release it at this point. It's far from polished, I've seen early access games that are better.			"

They will always have a higher value team as the computer seems to have limitless petty cash and hires star players and always has at least as many rerolls as you.

												WORST GAME OF THE YEAR!!!!!I love how it calls it self a strategy game with no real strategy component in it, its like playing chess and having your queen, as she is taking a pawn be crushed because its raining........ the pawn then turns into a second queen for the opponent.No game coder to date has written random code worth two â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.It's a flip of the coin game, the difference is you have to wait 50mins to see the winner.No real AI, the coders have written in comp ability to rig the dice when needed, what else can be said for the greatest let down of 2015Get this, i start a team, the kick off happens and a ""RANDOM"" event happens which Stuns 8 out of 11 from my team, then the other player knocks my blocker out and kills him, so not only do i loose the game but loose the best player as well, the GAME IS COMPLETE GARBAGE! random chance myâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.......................................................................................................................................................................................Im so angry at steam for letting this ill conceived SH%* stain of a game be sold and Games workshop for allowing one of FFSboard games to be brutally invisioned.A sign of the times, a complete waste of time.....

												Fun game idea ruined by way too much randomness. It is quite possible to succeed all sorts of improbable rolls while your opponent fails very safe moves over and over. Naturally, this is possible in reverse. So of course if your opponenet sees that they are failing all the rolls they aught to be making they quit. This means that very few games ever last untill the end. The game determines one person will get the good rolls that game, the other player figures that out and leaves. Makes for rather unsatisfying game play. If you don't care about winning, and can accept that strategy matters for surprisingly little, then it can be fun. The graphics are great, the commentary is funny, and the cut soons look cool and brutal.			"

												Purchased the game with high hopes as I thoroughly enjoyed the previous edition, sadly this was a disappointment as the gameplay is so drastically different from the original, and from the board game that I know and love, that this shouldn't have the name ""Blood Bowl"" associated with it at all. From no visibility to what block dice you rolled (for those times when maybe a both down is better than a pushback), nor any option to either follow up, nor pick where your opponent goes, this game may have potential for fun, but it really isn't Blood Bowl.What's a crying shame is that the graphics are an improvement, Jim and Bob are vastly improved and the campaign mode felt like it had a real story to get going but being forced to play humans, with no option to change to a different team, nor pick things like re-rolls (or at least no obvious way to do so!), it will get dull really quickly.Frankly, if you like Blood Bowl, avoid this game and get the previous edition instead.

												BB2 is a fun interactive story game. Considering how it was designed it would be inaccurate to claim it to be a strategy game considering that any strategy goes out the window with any of the numous kick off events that can literally kill multiple people on your side of the pitch or seriously effect the outcome of the game. If you want to play a game where your decisons mater, then this isn't a game for you. The best way to describe BB is that its a gambling game and no mater how well you understand the mechanics in far too many suitaitons any element of player control will be stripped from you entirely. This paticually Blood bowl game isn't worth buying. If you have read the top and think it sounds fun then you'll want to buy Blood bowl Chaos edition, which has literally 3 times more teams and a far better UI. If you really want blood bowl 2 I'd suggest waiting for it to go down to 10$ or less, because due to the sheer lack of content in the game its not worth more then that.			"

												The problem with Blood Bowl 2 is that it based on a board game franchise with fixed rules. This means that the new edition offers NO new game play or mechanics. It's basically only a HD remake of Blood Bowl 1 with some minor new features. The Blood bowl rules are complex, and I don't think that the partial tuatorial offers anywhere near enough to start a new player.And is it just me, or does the menu system let you conced a game without having to confirm FAR too easily? I have wasted 1 hour+ already replaying games where I accidently conceeded when I was actually winning.			"

												Cons! Percentages of action success means nothing, You very often fail on Ball Catching when is 80%+, chance, Pass 80%+, Shadowing 70%+, Dodge 80%+, Tackle 67%+ and 80%+. Abilities when it comes to % are completely broken and everything feels so random! Along with the dice rolls which begin to go against you the moment you get a break (score or have the upper hand in player numbers) make this game really frustrating. Either fix this % issue or display actual percentages.1. Game crashes/freezes very ofter, on campaign and on league.2. Complete absence of difficulty level on the 'story mode' : Campaign.3. Dice rolls seem to go against you when you got the upper hand (when you got more players on the field or winning)4. Game seems to be laggy between turns and certain actions.5. Funds are extremely limited on league. You often end up with teams full of linemen just to get by.6. Annoying the fact that you have to pay extra for the dlc's.7. Campaign is on the whole linear, it is actually a a tutorial. The absence of other scenarions or campaigns makes thos game easy to get bored with. You may only play that one human team and you haven't got any variery of options.8. Dice rolls tend to go against you when you start having the upper hand, down enemy players or scoring.9. Resources are clearly not adequate on League, you can have 2 dice reroll cards sacrificing better team players only to go against teams of equal strength with 4 dice reroll cards... Team players on many teams are bit expensive (10-20k off each player would ease the discomfort.Pros1. Beautiful designed teams, but your are limited on how many types of players (team setup) you may have on roster.2. Commentators are really funny and it is the most pleasant thing in the game.3. Interesting gameplay, sadly it is the only one of it's kind and frankly I am forcing my self to like it more than I should.4. If you compare this with Xcom2 then this game should be sold about 15 bucks.			"

												BB2 is not completely bad especially is you start learning to play. But for others player who were already on the previous version, BB2 is very frustrating. I can understand that there is not 23 teams they have to sell their game and make money but there is so many useful  options missing from chaos edition. And it is difficult to understand why they remove them?? As a lot of players I think I miss stuff like: the grid, display name on the player, create your team more easily (buy re roll), stats of the team player easier to read, free camera, ability to look the composition of the opposite team before choosing inducements, chat lobby... Also personally missing cosmetic stuff like: more colour option (I want to do my All Blacks team), more option for create player (not just head), level up change appearance like in BB1, specific cheerleaders, crowd in stadium more diversity (not only one type of men and ork),  in-game chat commentaries of the IA (it is nice in BB1CE)...So if you are a hard core player of Blood Bowl stay on BB1CE which is the better version until now!Cyanide faite des patchs pour ameliorer le jeu, qu 'il soit au meme niveau de contenue et option que le precedent, s'il vous plait ! Sinon le jeu est tres jolie, ingame et l'interface.			"

The game is great on console but I would NEVER recommend to anyone that they purchase it for PC online. 0/10 worst steam experience ever!			"

												Keep an eye on this game but at the moment it honestly feels unfinished, as many other commenters have put, its got some good features, refine UI better graphics etc. but the weirdly lacking options menu, the inability to have a campagin with a team of your choice (humans only), and lack of effort like all spectators being the same model with the same face in different coloured vests, there aren't race specific cheerleaders anymore either, just feels like a great game is in development but was rushed out the door, even the preorder bonus teams aren't available.And an example of why I (really hope at least) that its going to be updated, is its even lacking things as simple as animations on grounded playered, Blood Bowl had it, in this as soon as a player is knocked down they become a totally unmoving 3d model, which is suprisingly noticable.Bottom Line its ok like a 6.5/10 would be a 9 with some polish, currently not worth it vs buying the chaos edition of blood bowl 1 for considerably less money last time I checkedBut for me its definately put me off pre ordering anything from this studio again.Mid April Update. The developers promised the first of the additional races, out at the end of Febuary, then end of March, we are now into week 3 in April and not only no new teams but not even an update since 7th March. This game feels more and more like abandonware and I'm starting to think it will take the release of all 4 teams along with the resignation and suicide of all those involved in the delays will be required to ever make people forgive this joke of a studio. I will revise my statement from my earlier review I not only will not preorder anything from Cyanide again. I doubt I'll even buy anything by them.			"

												The game sadly came out with a lot of issuesI'll list the good and the badPROS:*The game runs smoothly (How ever requires DX11, despite system requirements saying otherwise*The UI has been vastly improved since the first game*It's funCONS:*The AI on all races is horrible. They play terribly, even a new player (Which I was) Can annihilate the AI, even when they have a better team.*There's near no dialogue in-game, despite a heavy focus being on the commentators of the game.*The animations are very repetitive, on the starting line-up you will often see everyone in the exact same pose, barely moving at all. *The animations are repetitive and aren't indicitive of anything in-game.*The art in-game is very low poly and low-res, yet the game forces you to be direct x11 compatible (Which means Windows 7 users can't play this game)*The game sells each pack of characters at around $10. It's a blatantly bad way to handle dlc, especially so early in.*The campaign is extremely short and halfâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥*Multiplayer matchmaking is added terribly in this game. Your opponent is random, there's no shaping to skill. You can only battle people within your own league, which is basically a group you join. It's a horrible system that makes the game terrible to play if you don't have friends, or good luck on who you fight.*The game is basically the first game again, I usually don't have this complaint about this, but I'm upset in this case.

												I want to like this game, but it is so frustrating. Been playing all day and this game is very frustrating. I've probably failed 90% of the times the game told me I had a 83% chance to succeed. In almost every game I played, the RNG determined that I would lose in the first 3 turns. Either from failing to pick up the starting kickoff 3 times in a row, having 3 injuries and 2 KOs on my team by turn 2, or from players tripping on the grass and dieing.I tried starting a lot of new teams in multiplayer but almost every single game it thought a fresh team would be great to match up with someone about 200 points higher with more abilities and experience.Glad I bought this elsewhere for $30 instead of paying $45 for it on steam. Not worth that much, wait for a sale unless you're really into Blood Bowl.			"

												On balance it is actually better than the previous versions of Blood Bowl, and I have been playing it a lot, and enjoying it. The problem is it's not MUCH better.The UI is improved in many ways, but in some ways it's also worse. The whole thing feels like it's two steps forward but one step back.I could not recommend this game to anybody who is not a hardcore Blood Bowl fan.Most glaring issues include (but are not limited to):Key re-binding menu is grayed out and currently un-usable. Game still feels like it's in alpha.Has nothing like the level of player, rule, and UI customization that Blood Bowl Chaos Edition had.I really, REALLY miss the old campaign mode. Single player ""Campaign"" is a tutorial where you can only play as the Reikland Reivers, which is fine for what it is, and fairly well done, but the old Campaign mode let you make your own team and play seasons and was actually my preferred way of playing the game in Blood Bowl Chaos Edition.With graphics settings all at full game looks very nice indeed, but will â¥â¥â¥â¥ing murder your PC. With graphics settings on anything but maximum the game looks worse than Blood Bowl Chaos Edition. Demand on hardware seems excessive for the end result, suggesting little to no optimization.For more information see this youtube video by cKnoor, King of Blood Bowl:


YouTubeâ¢ Video: Dear Cyanide - Let's talk about the Blood Bowl 2 BetaÂ 

			Views: 9,316		

			Here are some of the issues I'd love to see fixed before the game is out of Beta. Some minor, some more major.		

Issues that have now been fixed (I will extend this list as development continues, and change my thumbs-down to a thumbs-up when it seems good unto mine eyes):Now option to display player names and other information over the players heads, like you could in Blood Bowl Chaos Edition.Now able to turn off subtitles for commentators.Now option to turn grid on, like you could in Blood Bowl Chaos Edition.The ""End Turn"" button is now in a slightly less â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ place.There are now more than 4 teams to play as, and all have been free, no DLC charged as of yet.Lizardmen and Wood Elves have both been added to the accounts of those who pre-ordered.The 4 new races currently planned for DLC are going to be free if you already own the game.Kthanxbai.

												As someone who has played Blood Bowl since the late 80's and actually loved the ""Chaos"" edition, I thought this game would be can't miss, so I pre-ordered it with no doubt that it would be great. I was wrong. Despite wanting to love the game, it's awful. If you aren't already a Blood Bowl fan, avoid this game at all costs. If you are a Blood Bowl fan, and feel you must buy a Blood Bowl game - Buy The Chaos edition. That 4 year old game is much better than this.			"

												I have 3000+ Hours of Blood Bowl 1, more then 2000 matches, i run several succesful leagues. I really can NOT recommend this unless they improve several things.I could argue why but honestly iam to lazy and after 4 years watching Cyanide/Focus doing their work they clearly dont care about their users at all. They dont communicate, they implement rules oit of the blue without involving players who have been accumulating data from thousand of matches. They never finished one of their previous THREE Versions. All buggy all unfinished. Same thing with Dungeonbowl and dont get me started about ""BB Star-Coach"". I hope they start communicating with their customers and they really implement features from BB1 THAT WORKED GREAT and now they cut them for no reason (Leaguemanagement, Grid, Enemy inducements scouting ect!!!)GO BUY BB1 (legendary edition or Chaos edition) cheaper, more teams, less bugs more fun.I ran a league with almost 150 coaches now if you really imrove some of those things mentioned iam gonna be your greatest advertisemnt champion til then good luck.

												Wow.  Just... wow.  Worst AI in the history of AI.  The AI has absolutely no code in place for any of the basic premises of BB, with the exception of the occasional cage.  Absolutely horrible.  On top of this, they removed the flexibility to set your own rules... and they try to make up for their pathetic AI by just gifting the teams in solo leagues hundreds of thousands of coins so they can buy top Star Players for every match against you, even if they don't have the money.  Yay.Truthfully, I cannot ever recall being this disappointed by a game.  Cyanide should hang their heads in shame.<edit:  I've continued to push further into the game, in hopes of finding redemption.  I find little.  While I still will play because I love BB, it is an almost entirely mindless exercise now.  I've had the AI score a total of 1 (yes one) touchdown against me in now about 25 games.  The only positive thing I can say is that it doesn't appear to cheat.  Huzzah.>			"

I like stratergygames and building things up and mastering things and enjoying it alomg the way, but it's so frustrating that your tactics and choices along the way all depend on one thing only as to wheather they are sucessful or not, and that is a dice roll. luck of the dice.  keep rolling double skulls your tactics fail and your turn is cut short leaving you exposed as you were unable to counter all the moves the opposing team made, keep rolling hits or what you need and you'll be successful. no skill just luck of the dice.

Posted: July 5, 2016
												I am basing this review on my own experiances, because I understand that there are those who may not have had such a negative time with this game as I have. First off, This game is truly an amazing and fun game when, well, it wants to be. Matches only have two turnouts: Either the opposing team gets COMPLETELY screwed by ""rng"" or your team gets COMPLETELY screwed by rng. There is such a low level of strategy and skill in this game that such a brutal rng system really hurts the game at times. I am talking, turn 1, You injure two of your enemies immediately and stun another and knockdown the rest. While that will be fun for you, the other player is probably bashing their head against the wall. Vice versa, turn 1, your strongest player has a 3 dice roll, and gets 3 skulls. Reroll and get 3 MORE skulls. Those rng chances seem like they would only happen once in a blue moon, but they truly happen essentially every game. At this point you are probably thinking, ""Man you probably just suck git gud"". Well, maybe you are right, but rng aside, the games teams aren't exactly balanced either. The game basically consists of Chaos, Elves, and Lizardmen. Any other race stands no chance against their versatility and stopping power. Norse are a heavy contestant but just not good enough at times. The matches are either incredibly long winded or instant concedes. I have had this game since launch and only recently reinstalled this rage fest, to discover, I am uninstalling it again. Your only chances of enjoying this are if you have a HIGH HIGH tolerance to rage, or you are an extreme masochist and enjoy the agony of devastating rng. But, for me, it's a no. I'd give it a 6/10. Buy it on sale to try it, but never full price.			"

												I felt a strong need to review this game due to the fact I feel live I've been ripped off yet again by games workshop. Yes I enjoy playing against my friends when the seldom opportunity arises, but I find that playing against the computer - the dice are rigged against you. I've read a lot into this and consistant contradicting arguments have arisen. I personally find that the computer AI is really bad, so I always win games. But my players seem to get knocked down, injured, and just about every negative aspect - all when it should have a high probability of success. And then the computer succeeds on really low chances. Also they always seem to have more re-rolls than I can ever work out how to get!? So yes I can win the matches quite easily against the computer AI, but it's not enjoyable to play. Just because of the sheer price of this game - I would highly NOT recommend just for the multiplayer function.Literally you're just paying for a graphics upgrade really... and less teams. The grass doesn't make up for gameplay. Sorry.			"

												- Can't save during matches, god forbid that you can't sit on a game for 2 hours to finish a game without interuption, or if the game randomly crashes.- Players forced into retirement because of Online balancing in multiplayer or some such, even if you don't want to play online. Basically your players will be lost forever after a certain amount of games and you will have to rebuy new ones with no levels.- AI has suspiciously good dice rolls pretty consistantly. No doubt this is deliberate as to make the game more ""challenging"".Infuriating pretty much all around. Buy on sale if you buy at all, definately not worth the full price. Alternatively, play Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition. Same dodgy rolls but far less of these idiotic new mechanics they have added in.			"

												Game looks good and campaign is fun with lots of humor and a good buildup to learn the mechanics of the game on the acctual pitch. However, the multiplayer system with leagues and teambuilding is extremly poorly constructed and with little or no help for the player to understand how it works or with suggestions on how to play multiplayer. I also personally dislike the part where your players can die, not just die in a game and respawn later, die, for real, gone forever. There's too much of that in the real life, in this sence I prefer games to be unrealistic with at least options to resurrect, or whatever.If you have some extra cash and like this type of strategy game you might wanna buy this but in my view this game is not worth the money they charge for it, I'd say it worth a maximum of 10 USD.

CAn be lots of fun but gets ruined very fast with unbalanced â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. THE OTHER BIG THING is that there is no real incentive to win a match. Losers get paid only slightly less than the winner. And they both only get one MVP. So there is nothign to stop bashy teams just standing around trying to kill you. And at higher team levels, that is a real problem.			"

The concept is fun and compelling but the crushing weight of the luck factor makes actually playing it feels like being the victim of some kind of hidden camera prank. You'll get â¥â¥â¥â¥ed over time and time again because your players are incapable of picking up a ball lying on the ground, then see your opponent scoop up the ball, dance pass all your blockers, then chuck it down the field for an easy touchdown. Then once you've lost, feel the magic of playing a game of equal or greater difficulty with half of your players injured or dead. I seriously regret paying money for this game, it has provided an exclusively negative gameplay experience.			"

												I can't recommend this game at this time. I felt like this is one review I had to do. I love Blood Bowl. This game however is nothing to love. Games Workshop makes money and produce games that look like they were made ten years ago. No camera controls, no full screen options. Hell most common options aren't so common in this wireframe launch. Average game length is close to two hours. You gain injuries and deaths faster than you gain the money to replace players. Most of the 3 dozen or so games I've played end after only a few turns because the game has already thrown one player everything they need to win while killing off half the oppostion team. Since it's less expensive to delete your team and start fresh there is no incentive to continue playing if anything at all goes wrong for your team. Just start over and hope the game decides to give you everything that round. The very few games I did finish scored 2-1 or so but the difference in SPP from those games was more like 25-4. So if you're not winning by a lot you're gaining nothing while wasting almost 2 hours of your life. I did say I love BB and I do. But not this game. I want more ppl to be playing it so I'll have less down time between games, but I don't hate anyone enough to actually recommend they pay money for this turd.

												Compared to Blood Bowl 1, this game feels painfully slow. The UI and field visualisaion is horrible, even for an experienced player.The cut scences (which can be toggled off) become tiring after 2 minutes and even Jim and Bob's commentary started repeating after a couple of plays. "

												Where are my lizardmen?  No rebindable keys on the main menu and mouse or gamepad for the pc?  Gamepad?  Sorry, I'm on a PC.  Sure, some people use a gamepad for more action orientated games, but seeing how this is a... oh, right.  It's a port.  No configurable graphics options.  Heh.  So many other glaring issues or missing things from this compared to Blood Bowl.  Yes, it took DLC for Bloow Bowl to have all their races and such, but that is aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥poor excuse to use as a crutch for not implementing at least what was in latest version of Blood Bowl.  I'm not going to bother listing what is missing or what I'm specifically unhappy with as Cyanide Studios doesn't have much of a rapport with their community as it is.  First game refund for me.  Where are my lizardmen you dirtbags!?			"

												Game is a step backwards for the franchise.  The graphics were improved, that's about the only 'pro' compared to the last game.  The rest are 'cons.'  The 'campaign' is a glorified tutorial where you can play one team in a series of tutorial matches, most of which are tedious.  Major clipping issues, pointing to lazy animation work.  Customization of players is still a joke (choose from 9 heads for 16 different players, et cetera), star players share the same exact models/heads of your line players, no difference visually.  That's unacceptable.  The voiceover commentating was repeating itself wiithin the first 15 minutes of the game.  I'm really scratching my head, wondering what Cyanide spent their development time on, because I just don't see it.			"

												The game isn't nearly as bad as I had expected (Cyanide has a history of making bad games), but it still isn't worth the asking price.If you're interested in Blood Bowl 2, get it when it comes on sale. Don't pay more than 20â¬ for it. It simply isn't worth it.Below I reposted the first impressions I wrote yesterday after 6 hours of gameplay. Another 4 hours later, and I have nothing to add, except that I think the apothecary is bugged in campaign mode. I've had it roll 'dead' on the reroll every single time I've used it - and since you're forced to play human, that's often.My first impressions:They've learned nothing from the things they failed at in the first three blood bowl games.The commentary is still too limited, and by the second match you've heard several comments 3 times. The new camera system takes a lot of getting used to.The game engine is sluggish - which occassionally makes you choose to push someone into the wrong square.The game is best played with the sounds turned off, as the music is so short you can actually hear where it loops.skills are listed as icons instead of text now, which takes some time getting used to.While moving the maximum distance without 'going for it', the system sometimes tells you it's safe, but when you start moving, it'll calculate going for it as it tries to avoid tackle zones that didn't show. The 'log' window at the bottom is largely useless, as it has very very little space and no scroll feature.The graphics have improved, but when I got Bob on my team for half a match, I noticed how poorly his model was made - had a ton of clipping issues with his clothing.I still haven't figured out how to change my starting lineup without getting one of my guys hurt. It never worked properly in any of the other versions either though. Despite it's shortcommings, it's still Blood Bowl. I expected a bad rendition by Cyanide, and what I got so far seems a little better than I dared hope for. It hasn't crashed once, and it runs in borderless window mode by default.  "

												DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF EPIC GARBAGEAbsolute trash. The rolls are complete and utter garbage. No matter what, against the AI, you always roll like trash when you need to at least roll something! It never fails, and then the AI will roll and pass all these silly things over and over and over. Do I recommend this? H E L L no. I wish I could refund this garbage. I would rather play any other game besides this. The RNG is by far the absolute worse I have ever saw in ANY game I have ever played. HATE this game-----EDIT-----I have now played this game even more and besides the sh!t campaign (that is just basically a tutorial on how to play and is utter garbage), I am yet to win a single game against the AI. No matter what I tried, no matter what team I used, it was pointless. Why? Because the AI and its bull sh!t rolls non stop.I had games where I would get my turn, move, get a sh!t roll, and end my turn before I could do a single thing (this is what usually happens). Then, when I was able to do something, I would get stupid rolls and only be able to push the AI around and on their turn, they would knock my @$$ to the grouond, stun me, or injure me every time. The game favors the AI so heavily that it is just stupid-silly. ""Well then don't play the AI, play a Human!"" No thank you. I do not like playing online games against other players, especially since to compete you would need to have a team with some experience... well, you can't get experience if your team gets slaughtered every f*cking game.This game is so aweful and I am so p!ssed that I spent money that I can not get back. This is by far the worse RNG game I have ever played. I though World of Tanks and Mordheim City of the Damned were bad. HA! Those games are childs play compared to this piece of sh!t. If I could, I would GIVE this game to someone.			"

												Frustrating and poor gameplay result constant screaming as 1:32 chance for a player of rolling snake eyes never happens for the AI but happens frequently too you.  The game as a result of cheating will turn your almost certian victory into a defeat in single turn.  How does it cheat:- Real probablities not correctly reported- Real probablities not even correctly observed by AI, pre-cacluates success and failure and will occasionally not even make the move in failure knowing the future.  Would you still take the move or undo if you knew it was going to fail?- Pre-Match, AI spends money it doesn't have- Rules of Turnover extreme to the point that AI exploits to get out of losing or securing a winUnfortunatly it take's more than the 2 hour refund policy :( to figure that out and is not from a lack of skill.

PLEASE DON'T ENCOURAGE THEM BY BUYING THIS GAME, PLAY BB1. By being fooled into buying this game you are essentially promoting this money grab tactics by gaming companies.

												1) The newbie barrier to entry is rather big.  NO TUTORIAL.There is no tutorial for this game.  The game rather assumes that you are a competent BB player and know pretty much all the rules.There IS NO TUTORIAL FOR MOVING YOUR UNITS, TACKLING, BLOCKING... well, there is no tutorial.Many (most?) games have a tutorial which show you, with help text, how to.You watch/play this tutorial once or twice in your life (or more, up to you, until YOU feel comfortable with the UI) to learn the mechanics of the game and then you move on.But then again, the same mouse action has DIFFERENT results (double clicking on a piece to stand up either stands it up or pops up an extremely small popup where you must click ""standup"" and not misclick ""blitz"" which will lose you time as you try to deactivate your piece by fiddling with the mouse so you can click again meanhwile 0:20 left flashes on the screen...A simple ""how to"" tutorial with basic concepts for this game such as* how to make piece active and how to deactivate it and activate another piece -what exactly do you need to click* how to move* what are tackle zones and what can happen* how to play the odds - make the enemy roll more dice (crucial concept this, game is basically risk management)* pass the ball - how to pass, what are the odds and what are the ranges that you can pass to2) The matchmaker is the worst I have seen in any other game.  Bar none.Starting up, you make your team (by recruiting players) and your team value (TV) is howevering around 1000.Teams gain value (again, TV, team value) by skilling up their players/pieces.  You skill your piece by getting points for either passing the ball or hurting or killing (yes, it's a thing) an enemy piece.Teams are balanced to play at their starting TV, but in an open league in the game with hundreds of players, you will meet teams which are much higher TV than yours. Who will kill off your team. And skill up more. While your team will get nothing, because they CANNOT accomplish anything due to the mismatch.  And they are player by someone vastly more experienced than you, with many more BB2 games (matchmaker doesn't take player experience into account, neither.You get incentives which ""balance"" the game: get extra rerolls (which still fail ALL the time) or a doctor (which may heal your hurt player... or kill him, it is RNG hell).So basically the vastly superior enemy team skills up by killing off your starter team.3) No online pause.  Game takes, say 40 minutes no breaks... you want to pee?  Too bad.4) Display of crucial information on pieces is horrendous.  BB:CE has actual words on player cards which showed up when  you moused over a piece.  Words like ""Block"" or ""Loner"", which you could then mouse over and get a text description pop up.While I could read with no problem the actual words on player cards in BB:CE, the PIXEL SIZED icons on player cards are very hard to read.  I have never seen a smaller icon with crucial information for a player in any game.5) There is a two minute time limit for your turn.  Which I guess works well for people who have played BB as a boardgame and have logged many more games than me but for me, the 2 minute turn is NOT ENOUGH.I feel rushed, I misclick, if you have animations turned on the camera changes to a player running and/or player attacking an enemy piece, which zooms into the action and gets rid of the overhead view which allows you to see what happened where and pre-plan your moves (which you must do - remember, tik tok 2 minute limit, think fast newbie).Most people turn off the cool animations - so why have them?  Why ""upgrade"" from BB1 to BB2?6) The interface is the WORST I HAVE SEEN IN ANY GAME.  Let me give you an example - I moved a player with a ball, my thrower, and then wanted to check to which piece I wanted to pass the ball.  I moved the mouse over to another of my pieces, and clicked it...  Now, by doing so:I have ended the action for my passer/thrower and activated the other piece... and I am pretty sure I still had moves left on my thrower.Example 2: To stand up a player in BB:CE, I left double clicked on a piece to do so.  In BB2, sometimes left double clicking works for it to stand up but sometimes it does not - and a tiny pop up with ""stand up"" and ""blitz"" shows up and you must then click ""stand up"".  Same player action, different results in game.			"

												I still hate chaosI was really impressed with the looks of this game compared to the last even though I didn't own a prior title.Although it seems to be missing a prequisite of 11 races for the starting game the originals I've witnessed had.Now a lot of people I noticed don't seem to understand that the high price point for this game is mostly because it could harness and help nurture future updates.Which is perfectly fine if they sell this off for $45 even though chaos edition of blood bowl is only $30.It's a game from 2010 I don't see why you don't complain about that having a high price point at all even if it is excellence.But with this I feel like there's a lot of depth but no variation when it comes to tactics, because a lot of matches I play I end up with heavy offense teams going against me who just station their players right next to mine in leagues.So that way I always have to dodge roll for everytime my players get up.But with further development there might be more balancing and general fixing, I'm hoping that they add more races and graphical advances to make a already good looking game more good looking.There's also the single-blitz per action which is understandable but I don't know if skills allow you to attack to get up or not I don't think I've played enough to really judge that.But I can also say that the dice rolls feel very off, I can have 83% chance to pick up a ball and fail it on my reroll along with sure hands + picking it up atfirst.I also had a strong issue with the going for it which was also 83% a lot of the time.But that's mainly just me and I play high elves a lot.Otherwise though I reccomend it.

												Blood Bowl is originally a board game, and Cyanide once again fails to come up with a 99% correct simulation of said board game. They mess the rules up and toy around with changes and new features in some arbitrary attempt to spice the game up in its digital version. That would be interesting if they had ever managed to get the starting point right, which is the latest release of the board game rules. But they didn't. So those changes are not based on any analysis of actual game results but on personal taste of the guys in charge of this project. That makes Blood Bowl II a house rules game.The game plain sucks as a video game, its way behind its release date regarding technical aspects like graphics, and as a Blood Bowl game its just sad. Buy it if you want to give them some cash for a third try, but don't waste your time playing Blood Bowl II competitively.If you are new to Blood Bowl, this is sadly the prettiest video game version as of yet, and Blood Bowl still is a fantastic game concept. So give it a try to get a feel for the game. As soon as you are really into it, you will find this version to fall very short in many ways and you will probably google for other places to play the game. So you might as well do that now...			"

Spend time setting up a strat, set your players up for easier rolls...and watch the other team just sprint by you as you continiously fail rolls....this is not a joke.			"

												i have never ever written a review before this.  I am a fan of WH and many of its games.  I am not a at all knowledgeable of the programming it takes for cpu games, I simply like to play them.  Well, the programming of this game is stupid.  I love the games graphics, atmosphere, and everything you can tell the creators put into the game to make it authentic.  The problem....Im not much of a multiplayer gamer, I like to play mostly against cpu when coming to games primarily setup for multiplayer use.  The CPU in this game  as far as ,and I am  guessing the term ,  ""balance""  is horrible.  If the cpu needs to get a certain roll to do a certain thing in order to prevent you from winning, it will with out a doubt.  If you need a roll to do a certain thing in order to win, or even score, you will not without a doubt.  Make what could of been a good cross over of a really fun game in to something very aggrevating.  I am not ""bad"" or ""whinning"".  I once had a guy 2 MP from scoring.  The cpu brought a guy,  breaking 3 ""blocks"" ; moving 2 more spaces than his allow MP, and sucessfully attack my guy with the ball.  Wait, not done, he catches the ball mid air for an interception.  Every possible success  of those actions is supposed to be ""roll"".  Sure that sounds great and possible, but I believe even if you could do the math, it is highly unlikely to get 6 succesful ""rolls"" in a roll considering just the chance part not any of the applicable modifiers.

Failed to pick up the ball 7 turns in a row then the half ended with nothing happeningYea yea, something something RNG not really biased, perception bias, only happened to roll triple skulls twice in a row, blah blah. It gives you a real appreciation for how many thousand to one chances occur in daily life.RNG bias or not, it doesn't matter really as it ruins the game either way.Ironically the campaign starts without turnovers active, but this makes the game faintly enjoyable so it is quickly removed with no apparent option to disable, can't have people able to decide how to enjoy things can we now.Gripes aside, the new animations are ok but there are only a couple per model so it gets old very fast, Commentary is the same, after a couple of gamesit was all recycled commentary. All you can say really is that it's a bit prettier.			"

												I went into this game coming from BB:TM (a boardgame) and hoped I could get some interesting games going with heavy team building, but this seems like a game where most of the time is in the matches and the rng there just isn't for me. I dislike wasting an entire turn because my player failed to pick up a ball. I'm sure if you're down to playing long matches, limited team building and like punishing rng rolls, then this game could be really fun. Just isn't for me.I tried the campaign but got bored of playing the match before it finished, then I tried making my own team and got bored playing that. The failing of rng is too severe - and I know you can get stuff to reroll failed attempts, but... the matches are still too long and that's not what I was looking for.			"

												This is my biggest rage game in my library. The dice will hate you. Players take way too long to level up. MAJOR balancing issue between teams. I know the game kinda addresses this by providing a ""skill"" gauge with a 1-5 star system, but it's a major let down for players like me wanting to enjoy playing certain teams. I wanted to like the High Elves. The player models are boring. I don't know why anyone would want to play as the humans. The only interesting thing about them is their ogre player. And leveling up your stadium takes even longer! Features that could make the game more interesting via stadium upgrades require a lot of time and effort. And there are less than a dozen different staduims!!! Why the F@#$ is there not a stadium for each team??? There is so much LESS content in this game than in the last game.Honestly though, I'm not suprised in the least. I HAD high hopes for this game. But this has been the GW bull@#$% practice for the last couple of decades. Save yourself the money. Especially now. If you had gotten this game a while ago, at least you saved yourself some heartbreak by getting the 6 last dlc teams for free. But if you were thiking about it, each additional team is a bout 7 bucks.			"

												2 boring and weird moments of all game:you rising your characters, pays attention to their skills and stats, put tons of time into the game, but as result after 8-10 games all your team will left you, so if you palyed over 1 week to create ""dream team"", just forget about it and start once again! This is so stupid to permament lose you team characters because of ""years"" that they spent in game and than start again with noob no skilled players at your league. Second stupid thing is rent for star players, that cannot be lvl'ed but can be hired only for 1 game...

												This has got to be the most frustrating and stupid game I've downloaded in a LOOONG time!  The players constantly fumble the ball (one match the ball was on the ground for 6 turns in a row with around 5 players fumbling every attempt to pick it up), the game has players simply fall on the ground for no reason at all (which forfeits your turn instantly), the game allows the other team to kick off and then have an AI fan cheer that allows them to catch thier own kick off while your player stand and can't move (oh, then they run for a touchdown).I could go on and on and on with the stupidity that happens in this game.  It has potential but with the stupidity that happens (which I think the Devs were thinking it would be funny) it simply ruins any aspect of tactics involved and turns the game into some wierd form of constant dice roll chance and unforseen mishaps that ruin the play.

												I bought this game on release (or before? I remember I had Lizardmen back then which I don't have now). After playing just  an hour, I got a refund because the dice-rolls were so off it's just not funny.Recently I got this game in a bundle at ~75% OFF and that's the only pricetag I would start to recommend it to casual players.I'm not a big review-writer, so only one example which frustrates me the most:- Picking up the ballLike seriously, it shouldn't be that hard to pick up a ball as the thrower which is right besides you (after kick-off). I only logged the last 8 trys and (including re-rolls) I managed to pick up the ball 1 single time while the chance was always at 67%. Like a lot of others have written already, the odds/dice are way off because the AI lacks the I(ntelligence).It's fun to watch the short scenes which are pretty brutal to me since I'm more the strategy type of gamer (Paradox titles mostly) but that's it already. I might play it every now and then when I need a rest from real strategy games because it doesn't involve much brain to play since strategy isn't helping you much anyway when the next roll is off again.

												This is a tentative, on balance, I guess I recommend it.What it does, it does well. True, there aren't many teams yet, and we'll have to pay for them later - but still a lot cheaper than getting them all as miniatures, never mind painting them. The graphics are terribly pretty.The 'campaign' mode seems to be an extended tutorial, as far as I can tell, which for a BB vet is frustrating - but I'm not sure it has enough pointers to be useful for a novice. As far as I persisted with it, you get a series of matches linked by story, with the rules of the game being introduced a bit at a time - the earlier matches have most things work automatically, for instance, and gradually fewer things work automatically. You also get no SPP, up to the point I gave up at.I've not tried the MP yet, so can't comment on that.Playing SP leagues, however, works mostly better than the previous Cyanide BB games. I would say I like it, certainly. The AI seems slightly cleverer than BB:CE, though still does some really silly things (why try and pick up the ball when you literally cannot score a touchdown before the end of the half? Why not just pummel me in the hope of KOs/injuries?).Oh, and having turn timers in SP. That's kinda annoying.My biggest gripe, actually, is that after all the fuss of adding the ability to not use skills when you chose to BB1, that feature seems to be absent. If anyone knows how to do it, please tell me.			"

												Game is absolute garbage.  Poor graphics and the teams are nowhere close to balanced.  The RNG is terrible.  Constantly role improbable odds that result in losing a game.  Had one player role 9 1's in a row, which is roughly a one in a million chance.  Also, game is completely based on luck.  If a player gets lucky early in the game the other team gets crushed.  Not worth the money.  Complete waste of time.			"

												Very poorly made, never optimized.For a simple game like this to not optimize is a crime. Dev's should be sued.Guess they don't care abusing the franchise for a quick buck.Graphics are under par as well. More ps3-gen than 2016-gen.OMG that rng, ... I remember a time, called the golden era of gaming, where rng was taboo,.. plebs ftw..anyways, if u've played the boardgame irl then u realize how different this pc version is dice-wise. I've never thrown 6 one's in a row irl, yet online....The 6 not included races u must buy is an insult. Wouldn't have bought the game if I had known beforehand. U took (stole) the enjoyment of unlocking these racaes away,..... AND I payed u for this  >.<My advice, don't buy, This game was kept down for a reason. GREED			"

												I actually love this game. And it pains me to not recommend it but for paying $50. and them Cyanide to charge $7 for each other race is just ridiculous. I do not know how this will bode for future races or if this will be a reoccuring thing but the fact that I cannot play as wood elves on a game I paid as much as a full release almost is just rediculous and then you still only get a few races. Then there are a few problems that if you watch youtubers on the Blood bowl scene you can find out about.Edit: Ok. Cyanide. You win. I love you guys again. I do love that major update. I think that was a fair way to do it where if you own the game before the races comes out you get them. And if anyone thinks I'm saying that just because I bought it fairly early let me put it this way the only race I really want I am still going to have to buy if I want to play(wood elves).			"

												Hmm. I wanted to like this. Really. I loved the old BB so I was looking forward to this one, and overall I was dissappointed. Basically this is simply a reskinned version of the old game, but with fewer teams and fewer options. Yes the graphics are better, and yes the user interface has been improved, but that's not saying a lot as the original was pretty poor. Other than that it has nothing to recommend over the old version, with the added sting that new teams are looking to be paid dlcs so 8 teams in BB2 and 23 in BB1. The new graphics are an improvement but the cut seens will soon get tiring and I suspect will be turned off, leaving you with a slightly prettier but no better game.That may actually be the issue. BB is a very good game. A direct port from a well loved and tested boardgame, with the added bonus of not having to remember all the rules and exceptions. BB1 basically hit almost every gameplay button available, so other than nicer graphics and a smoother interface there is nothing that can be added without stepping away from the original. So a good effort I suppose, but until the old BB1 servers go down or the new teams come out (and at a reasonable price) I would suggest stick to the old version.			"

You have replaced action and excitement with camera tricks that get boring...Solo Play: Although it is there it doesn't have the same feel that the bb1 Campaign had.. bb1 gave me a feeling of taking a team of greenhorns from new to world champs.. Solo in BB2 misses this completely as there is no real feeling of ladder progression.Things it still needs: (In my opinion)- Camera Rotation- Grid for player movement- More race/role specific animations- A more story focused solo game that isn't based around the Reavers- More Teams, I know it will come.. just dont skimp on the number and bring back all the teams from BBCE.. I want my Chaos Dwarfs in HD  :)- Freedom of choice on the Team colours and More Heads for players. (see below) I do feel that from BB1 you have made a step in the right direction for team visual creationhowever...Bloodbowl in essence is a game based on plastic models/figures. 50% of the game is about creating your own teams identity.. Painting them.. Basing them.. Giving them names.. creating their history/story and overall building a personalised identity for them to the point that when playing you cheer when they succeed and feel pain when your best player has a crippling injury.To me this is what makes the GW games like Bloodbowl, Mordheim and Necromunda such great games..Even with the limitation on available models for the TTop version you would go that extra mile to make each player individual in their own way.. I understand the need for limitations on molded models but I do not understand the need to have limitations in a graphical based game... Even just allowing us to change hair colour and add/remove beards/Facial accessories would be good..Freedom to change colours on the Armour rather than forcing us to use a limited range of preset schemes which sadly lack imagination as all teams have a similar set..And yes it is more man hours to provide these options to your customers but it is also the difference between hitting the bullseye or just missing again on your 4th attempt...Overall I would say 7/10 Touchdowns			"

												I have decided to edit my review to reflect the changes and fixes that have been made to the game.Before, i did not reccomend the game because of the frequency of gamebreacking bugs and lack of features at Launch. these have since been fixed and the 2 races that were developed before launch but sold seperatly as DLC or preorderbonus have now become part of the main game.The developers have recently announced that the next 4 races will also be free DLC wich of course is great for people that play the game, i dont think it is neccesary though since DLC that is developed after Launch has the right to cost money. The Good+ The graphics update is amazing, a few minor things like race specific cheerleaders are missing but overall its a HUGE upgrade+ The multiplayer has been Improved significantly, ever since the first few bugs have been swatted i have not disconnected from a single Multiplayer game. there seem to be no Desynchs or Ping issues at all.+ A few balance changes have been made to the game that are very close to the custom rules developed by the remains of the bloodbowl tabletop community The Bad- Sadly there is no more campaign feature for all races. There is still a campaign but that one is only for the Humans and functions primarily as a tutorial.- The ammount of races and available customisation options for your Players is lower then in the blitz campaign of ""Bloodbowl Chaos Edition"".However 2 new races have already been added to the game and 4 more have been anounced as free DLC.- My last point is a Matter of personal taste, i would have very much enjoyed a few more customization options for your Team. Unlike the progression for your players, the progression for your Team is rather unintuitive.Buying more then 4-6 rerolls (depending on your race) and an apothecary is actually detrimental to your team as it inflates your teamvalue and gives an opponent an advantage (through petty cash) that far exedes what having the additional cheerleaders or coach assistants gives you. chearleaders, assistant coachas und fanfactor are basicly useless as they only effect a very small number of random events that may or may not appear at all during the Game.To summarize, The game has improved tremendously, at launch It was fun but had problems, alot of wich have been fixed so now its just fun :)There is still no relevent Campaign but the focus of the game is Multiplayer and that Part is amazing.

												An american football game, in the Warhammer setting, with all that that means. Chaos (both the race and the state of things), blood and death. Turn based like the table top game it's based on fits it well. Graphics are an improvement over the first game, and the commentator voice actors are good, especially Jim.The single player campaign is fun, and has a cool story.For multiplayer you basically pick a race to play, create the team and then get matched vs teams around your team rating. There's something for everyone. Orcs, Dwarfs, 2 Human teams (Empire and Breton), Lizardmen, 3 Elf teams (Dark Elves, Wood Elves and High Elves), Chaos and Skaven.Update: They are releasing four new teams within the next few months. Norse, Undead, Necromantic and Nurgle.			"

												A general improvement over the original, while lacking in some of the features of it's predecessor (specifically certain aspects of the UI)  it has more than made  up for this by adding a fully fleshed-out campaign and a more efficient, if a little confusing at first, lobby system. While I'm a huge fan of the table-top and would suggest purchasing this outing into the genre, i'd also warn you to save your money and purchase it on sale if you're a not a fan.			"

												Been playing BB for about 10 years. Right now BB2 its a great game. Obviously they ran outta time for somethings (eg cheerleaders). Also right now there are alot of consesions because there isnst heaps of incentive to win. My suggestion would be give the winning team a mini mvp where 3spp (or some number) are randomly assigned to one of the winning team's players. That would make winning more desireable without punishing people who disconnect or conceed. My two cents.			"

Product received for free
												Blood Bowl 2 is a note-perfect recreation of a Games Workshop tabletop American Football game set in the Warhammer Fantasy Battle universe. That means itâs turn-based, packed with dice-based randomness and heavy with rules that are quite mystifying to new players. Oh, and itâs chock-full of Orcs, Vampires, Skeletons, Ogres, Trolls, Elves and Dwarfs, violence, and cheating.In a typical match, players (either human or AI) take turns moving and blocking with their team, whilst trying to get the pigskin ball from their half to the opponentâs backline for a touchdown. Just like American football, passing is a huge gamble and many teams just play a running game, or even a hitting game where you just try to injure your opposing team.There are dice rolls for almost everything. Want to move out of a playerâs tackle zone? Move a die. Want to pass the ball? Throw that die. Want to sprint an extra square? Run that die. Want to grind on a downed playerâs throat to send him out of the match? Stamp on the die. Blocking is represented by throwing multiple dice depending on the playerâs relative strengths, with the higher strength player allowed to pick the outcome from the dice. Fortunately, the game now tells you what the percentage chance of success is, rather than having to work it out yourself from basics.Given that the match engine is built on so much randomness, Blood Bowl is actually all about learning, positioning, and avoiding gambling until you have to. Even what seems like the most sure-fire action can result in a horrific failure. A three-dice block from a levelled-up strong player on a rookie should knock them down 95 percent of the time, but that small chance of the veteran going down does crop up, and you have to play knowing that.Any failure, however minor, means a turnover, where control switches to the opponent. So, if players are unlucky enough to fail their first action every turn then the game can be over very quickly, but a game between two players who know what theyâre doing, who only take calculated risks, can last more than half an hour.Every turn has you organising the most important actions in your head, then recognising their probabilities. You always move your players into covering and supporting positions first, if possible. Sometimes you donât do things just because a small chance of failure is enough to ruin your plan entirely. Letâs say you have a three-dice block lined up which would likely result in an injury, which would give you a numerical advantage in later turns. But you have also have a ball-carrier standing near the enemy scoring zone with enemy players just a few steps behind them. Here, you play the ball, not the man. Scoring is the most important thing, and only when youâre way ahead can you afford to gamble.Unless, of course, youâre a team that plays the man, not the ball, like the high strength Chaos team or the block skill-heavy Dwarf team. The aim of these guys is to be as close with as many players as possible, get them on the floor, then stamp on them when theyâre down. Even with the average human team, I played games where I knocked out almost the entire opposing team and just ran the ball to the touchline each turn.Thatâs the joy of Blood Bowl, the way that the slightly different stats, costs, skills, and levelling path of each team member will result in huge team differences that play out in every action. The extra point of strength that a Black Orc has over a normal Orc means that heâll normally be attacking with two dice instead of one, which hugely increases his chance of success.Developer Cyanide has improved the game substantially since its previous iteration, renovating the terrible UI and making it much more understandable and user-friendly. New elements like the Cabalvision preview let you see what will happen with your current action should you choose to go ahead with it. There are still problems, however. It seems to take ages to block an opponent, as you pick the target, confirm the block, roll the dice, choose whether to re-roll, pick a single die from your roll, pick the direction that the opponent will be pushed, choose whether your player will follow up, and finally have to watch a short unskippable cutscene of the block. In a turn you might do several of these blocks, which is why thereâs a timer to restrict the turn to four minutes.Though the individual games are important and enjoyable, itâs the league modes where the game really comes to life. These are single-player or online multiplayer, with a wide management model (now including stadium upgrades) and handicapping to balance weak teams against strong ones. Every difficult action in the match game (scoring, passing, injuring) gives XP to your players, and as they level you get a choice of random upgrades to customise them. My chaos teamâs Minotaur got a mutation that replaced his left hand with an enormous claw, massively increasing his chances of injuring people.Injuries or deaths in a single game are just annoyances, because they can take key players out of your team for the rest of the match. A permanent injury can also render a player effectively useless; who wants a slow catcher or a half-blind thrower? But in the campaign mode, replacing a dead or crippled player can be horribly expensive. Teams with low armour, like the agile Skaven or the Wood Elves, are especially prone to this, but even tough teams regularly lose players.Cyanide has made some welcome changes to the League system, making it slightly more comprehensible and matches easier to arrange. Theyâve introduced ageing into the league modes, so that teams really do change over time, meaning you canât rely on that star player always being there. The new online transfer market is a bit more of a gamble (see Diablo III); there were no players listed in the review version so weâre not sure how well itâs going to work. But the new live streaming and replay integration (under the name Cabalvision) is a very welcome touch.This version also introduces a single-player campaign mode, which was the most egregious absence from the earlier games. Youâre the new coach of the Reikland Reavers, the most famous human team, which has fallen on hard times. Most of them have been killed, their two-star players are in hiding, and a strange new sponsor is manipulating them behind the scenes. Through the long campaign youâve got to recover the teamâs fanbase and standing, rebuild the team from a bunch of rookies, recover your star players, and discover what the nefarious plot is that threatens the team every match.You can really tell that Cyanide has put a huge amount of work into this, from the gorgeous animations throughout, to the gentle humour of the two commentators, to the sheer length of the story. Many missions have surprise events that happen partway through, or tough victory conditions that you have to achieve, as well as winning the game. The AI teams still make stupid mistakes but, hey, that's AI.For a French recreation of a British board game pastiching an American hobby, Blood Bowl 2 is remarkably coherent. Perhaps if Cyanide had stuck less rigorously to the board game and streamlined some of the processes, then theyâd have made a better video game too, albeit one that could have alienated their hardcore fanbase. Yet overall, Blood Bowl 2 is a step forward. It's a much friendlier, easier game than its predecessors, with improved looks, a tutorial campaign, controller support, and UI improvements. New players won't feel blocked off from enjoying it.THE GOOD Handsome-looking fantasy monstrosities Deep, complex tactical sports management Long single-player campaign Charismatic, witty in-game dialoguesTHE BAD Underlying mechanics are still a challenge for new players Plodding actions in-game, slowed further by animations Deep knowledge required to participate in online leagues			"

												I love this game as much as i hate it. Doing everything right and still losing because of luck is the worst feeling I have EVER encountered in a game. That being said destroying an opponent no matter what they do and stomping their players into the ground may be the most gratifying feeling to exist.The game revolves around strategy so it can be a bit tough to pick up at first but the community is probably the nicest to exist at the moment and can offer alot of help. Plus people have tons of videos on the teams and play styles so theirs endless ways to improve if youre having trouble.Overall I love this game and it fills me with the highest highs and the lowest lows. A true roller coaster of emotion. 1/10 no grappling hooks.			"

												Great adaption of the Blood Bowl board game, with a few minor annoyances. If you are new to the game probably not the best place to start but with those familiar with tabletop rules you'll get started in a flash.* It's a shame a lot of the quality of life features from the Chaos Edition never made it over (export teams, away jerseys)* thankfully changes to orc roster were rolled back* human catchers still have more AV than tabletop equivellents* kick doesn't work the same as tabletop (if you have the skill you have to use it, unlike tabletop where you could choose)* the ladder is awfulLeagues are where this game shines, fine yourself a good one. The RPS Cup, UKBBL and orca-cola leagues are all great, but any league is better than the shonky ladder.Buy if you know what you are getting yourself into.			"

Something about it just makes you want to come back for more, no matter how many times you rage quit from double skull rolls. Blood Bowl 2 is one of the few sports games to ever have a decent storyline and fun gameplay. My experience with the online community has been pleasant in most cases.

												It is a fun concept and I enjoy the basic idea behind the game, but it needs a lot of help before I would recommend it. The game play is very clunky; moving the players us a total pain as is trying to play any ""specials"" of the players. The interface really needs work. The dice engine is ridiculous. Playing against an online player the dice rolls are not too bad because both sides get equally messed over. If you play against the AI it seems to very rarely miss a die roll no matter how ridiculous, and you will seemingly miss the majority of your dice rolls no matter how good the odds are for you. The player development is also very clunky.			"

												This was my old review: Less content than bb1 but better quality overall, I'm sure they will implement everything is missed, bb1 was incomplete too at launch.NOW: what I said at launch was totally wrong, I'm sad to say Blood Bowl 2 it's a fail, specially for people like me who bought it mainly for the single player portion.Not even close to the depth offedred by BB1, the only better thing it's the graphics but I honestly don't care, not if I have to say bye to the features that made me love this game.Maybe my expectations are just too high, but what I really expected was a BB1 IMPROVED, means same content, better graphics, better netcode, better RNG and so on; nothing revolutionary, nothing really ""new"", still, I was disappointed.This review goes from positive to negative, at this point I'm sure that this game won't go even close to blood bowl 1.

												An american football game, in the Warhammer setting, with all that that means. Chaos (both the race and the state of things), blood and death. Turn based like the table top game it's based on fits it well. Graphics are an improvement over the first game, and the commentator voice actors are good, especially Jim.The single player campaign is fun, and has a cool story.For multiplayer you basically pick a race to play, create the team and then get matched vs teams around your team rating. There's something for everyone. Orcs, Dwarfs, 2 Human teams (Empire and Breton), Lizardmen, 3 Elf teams (Dark Elves, Wood Elves and High Elves), Chaos and Skaven.Update: They are releasing four new teams within the next few months. Norse, Undead, Necromantic and Nurgle.			"

												I've played a lot of tabletop Blood Bowl, so much so that I own 5 different teams. In comparisson this game is pretty great. The same rulings as previous games, unsurprisingly, but, unlike the previous games this one is severly lacking in the campaign section, as well as that I've recently experienced a bug that causes the game to crash before even loading up. I have finally fixed this by deleting and reinstalling the game for the third time. All in all this game is good, and looks beautiful, but in comparisson to the past games it is still just better graphics and one new race: 'The Brettonians'. If you're into the tabletop, or the past versions of this gamethis may still be worth picking up in the sales, especially woht the promise of 4 new teams, but if you're not experienced with Blood Bowl, I recommend you buy Chaos Edition first if you want to get into this game.

												Hmm. I wanted to like this. Really. I loved the old BB so I was looking forward to this one, and overall I was dissappointed. Basically this is simply a reskinned version of the old game, but with fewer teams and fewer options. Yes the graphics are better, and yes the user interface has been improved, but that's not saying a lot as the original was pretty poor. Other than that it has nothing to recommend over the old version, with the added sting that new teams are looking to be paid dlcs so 8 teams in BB2 and 23 in BB1. The new graphics are an improvement but the cut seens will soon get tiring and I suspect will be turned off, leaving you with a slightly prettier but no better game.That may actually be the issue. BB is a very good game. A direct port from a well loved and tested boardgame, with the added bonus of not having to remember all the rules and exceptions. BB1 basically hit almost every gameplay button available, so other than nicer graphics and a smoother interface there is nothing that can be added without stepping away from the original. So a good effort I suppose, but until the old BB1 servers go down or the new teams come out (and at a reasonable price) I would suggest stick to the old version.			"

												While graphically superior to BB1, the game is otherwise very lacking. There is no real campaign mode, only a glorified tutorial. There are lots of essential features missing, such as ingame chat lobbies, mouseover tool tips, grids, nameplates and optional use of certain skills, such as fend. Other things that would be nice are options to only play animations at injuries, not every stun/ko result, better league management and information, better ai that plays differently based on race and more lore tidbits. The game is very console-ish, which is understandable, but they still could add basic pc features to it. It's fun to play multiplayer, but not really more so than BB1, which I'll probably keep playing until bb2 is improved. I recommend getting it eventually, but not until it's on sale and have more than 8 (10 with DLC) races available. A complete edition in a year or so for 50-75% off would totally be worth it.Edit : Since I originally wrote this review, they've made a lot of improvements, and I feel the game is recommendable now. It's still not flawless by any means, but it's getting better. If you see it at a discount, buy it.			"

												Firstly, let me say that I love this game, even with it's buggy RNG, game crashes forcing you to lose and other glitches that people have pointed out already.Or at least, let me say, I love what this game COULD be.The most game breaking bug is with the ""Random"" Number Generation which dice rolls are based on.  If you play as it is now, you will lose even if you have made all the right plays and calculations simply because the game gets ""hung up"" on rolling failures while the opposing team RNG is ""stuck"" rolling successes.As long as you don't mind losing a game that you by all accounts should have easily won, you'll have fun.But if you expect the game's RNG to be accurate and reflect true statistical probability, you will probably kill yourself if you try playing it.TL;DRThere is fun to be had with Blood Bowl 2, but the game's RNG is significantly broken.  Play at your own risk.			"

												Do not turn your nose up on this game because the reviews say mixed. This game looks extremely better than all the previous titles, it plays smoother, its way more user friendly than any other Blood Bowl title. All its missing is the teams from all the others which Surprise, they didnt have at launch either. The Devs are responding to us for the first time ever and have promised the first 4 teams (Which launch in Febuary) for free if you own the game before they launch. Buy this game, and Praise NuffleI'm leaving the above review for reference and scope on what I have to say now. It has been 5 months since the release of the game and we got our first new team today. 3 monthes after what was promised, even if it was still free. Most of the fans have died off and wait times for a random matchmade game is ludicrous. Unless you have enough friends to make your own closed league I wouldn't bother anymore. The only option to play anymore really is to join one of the communites that has set up leagues and get into them. The Devs have killed their own game by taking 5 monthes to make one race that should have been started the moment the game went live. GG Cyanide. GG			"

												I love Bloodbowl and so like and play this game a lot.  However, i would not recommend buying this until the Devs make it absolutely clear what their plans are for improvements and dlc.  Communication is very poor, and the fact they have decided to sell so much of the content as extra dlc should make anyone very wary.  I would give it a few months and see what they have released - also if you buy now you will not be able to access Lizardmen or Wood Elves, so there is a good chance you will end up feeling a little cheated.  If you absolutely love Bloodbowl, then maybe you can put all the niggles to one side and enjoy it as I have, but if you like to feel like you are not getting slightly diddled, then maybe hold off.Additionally, I should add that the single player options are very limited and that online play is the only avenue that will offer some satisfaction.  If you are familiar with BB1 then you may also notice quite a few features missing with little added other than graphically.  If this game was supported lovingly and genuinely by the Devs then this could be great, but if they are only in it for the margins then trouble lies ahead.Edit Feb 2016 : Some features have been added, though others are still not here.  Updates and improvements are being made to the game, but there is still work to be done as crashes are still happening due to bugs.  Nice touch to offer the next 4 races free, so well done to Cyanide there.  Single player is much the same though - sad news if you don't want online games.  Here's hoping for continued improvement, and I must admit I do keep coming back for more.  Been on sale a few times now, and I would certainly recommend picking it up in one of those.Edit April 2016 : Support for this game is a bit of a joke.  The devs do not communicate at all.  Looks like it will fail to reach full potential with the very slow release of a few more teams, then die a sad death - largely due to lack of ANY support from Cyanide.  Hugely disappointing.			"

												A d6 game that has 2 failures per die. Expect to be murdered by the dice just like in the TT game. If you can handle that then this is a pretty well designed game. Good art, teams seem to be coming out fairly regularly, decent community as far as I can tell. Some of the animations are a little off but you should probably just turn thatâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥off to save time anyway. The campaign is just an extended tutorial that new players should probably complete most of. Some of the challenges are fun/difficult but overall this mode ain't too great.			"

												Even if you arn't a football (amarcan ver) fan, you can still have a fun time with this game. The DLC teams  may be costly, but with my time of playing the netromactic team they can become one hell of a strong team once your players level up. You can level up players with online or souwl leage members, (I whold recumend starting with a souwl leage due to from what I can tell the game always starts with unleved teams and you can once you level up a player.)

												Firstly, let me say that I love this game, even with it's buggy RNG, game crashes forcing you to lose and other glitches that people have pointed out already.Or at least, let me say, I love what this game COULD be.The most game breaking bug is with the ""Random"" Number Generation which dice rolls are based on.  If you play as it is now, you will lose even if you have made all the right plays and calculations simply because the game gets ""hung up"" on rolling failures while the opposing team RNG is ""stuck"" rolling successes.As long as you don't mind losing a game that you by all accounts should have easily won, you'll have fun.But if you expect the game's RNG to be accurate and reflect true statistical probability, you will probably kill yourself if you try playing it.TL;DRThere is fun to be had with Blood Bowl 2, but the game's RNG is significantly broken.  Play at your own risk.			"

												Well... time has come to give BB2 my thumbs up.Its a shame that reaching the actual state of the game has taken more than half a year and it looked more like an early access title to me for a long time.I can recommend BB2 by now, as BB itself can be a great deal of fun,but it is still a lot of work to be done to make BB2 a top title.- Lots of races still need to be added- Still some patching needed- The Grid got essentially better, but still needs a few tweaks (get rid of the black boxes for players with 4+skills, f.e.)- Some more administration possibilities are needed, f.e. seeding was pretty good for some comtetitions in BB1, but so much more i could think of.- Cyanide rule changes are not optional- Lobby / chat were a good thing for league play and are missed, too.-  Game still takes longer than in BB1, options to speed up animations are needed and still in singleplayer an option to speed up AI is missed.And last, but not least: Just take a look at FUMBBL. If cyanide can ever realise a Blood Bowl game and add all the options of that free game, just as good looking as cyanide is able to do it.... i would give a 10/10 rating immediatly and try to sing a hymn about it.I give it 6/10 by now.;)			"

												With the Legendary edition soon adding the long awaited custom campaign and 8 races (Including my favourite, the halflings), I'd say wait for that unless you want to play the multiplayer. For me the game was already worth buying for the RNG either completely destroying you or making your opponent concede 4 turns in.			"

												Chaos edition offered a much larger variety of things to the game. For a start more races, and no micro transactions. Everything worked smoother. The only real upgrade are the graphics which are not that big of deal since it is game of tactics not gameplay. An expensive price or a mediocre game, if you want to play Blood Bowl, get Chaos Edition, the player base is still there and it you pay less for it than you would for one of the DLC's in Blood Bowl 2.[EDIT]So a developer actually replied to my review. A few things i wanted got added which is nice. No DLC in 6 months though. The pricing is still too much in my opinion. Will keep this review negative for now.[EDIT2]I am finally changing this to positive as the game seems to be on the right track once more.We got more races and grid mode is back. Also legendary edition seems promising and I will be picking that up.			"

												Revised 22/02/2017The microtransaction store I was so suspicious of lies disused, and the game is being supported solidly, there are still quirks but the developers have mentioned an awareness of them and claims to be moving to resolve them and the teams are being added at a solid pace. I'd now genuinely consider BB2 over BB1 the superior PC game by a fair margin.Old review: 12/12/2015: not a recommendation.They started selling currency as of a recent patch. This is harmful as that currency can be used to gate access to competitions, the fact is, they could change the games economy in a number of ways, addng a real money tap on the back end gives them alot of freedom to slowly tweak things, look what Konami did with 'insurance' in MGSV.You might say, but it's not objectively dangerous, it's just pretend money used to buy cosmetics, but IAP was not in the game I paid money for, its a feature I never asked for and do not appreciate, they are only suggesting skins will be gated behind ""cyan"" coins. But you get 1000 for Â£40 if you get the largest pack 20 for Â£1.49 with the smallest. 20 cyans gets you one skin for one team, and I imagine, it won't be enough to get a other 'fun features' when they are added later.I do wish there was a ""level thumb"" because I do have mixed feelings, the game has a few teething issues with skills not being implimented and the optionality of skills not being in game and a few stupid rule tweajs Cyanide made which are mandatory and unwelcome, but the real sticking point they are already charging Â£5 a team, they have their ongoing revenue stream to support development, cyan coins are just farming 'whales' for money.BB1 set a precident which lead to me buying BB2, and they are falling short of my expectations, they might well fall short of yours too.

												Great game, runs on most systems, but you will want better performance so you can watch the cutscenes when you make a great block, catch, or score.Continually adding new races via DLC instead of new game editions is a nice change from the original game, as well as improved netcode that allows players to rejoin a match if they disconnect.

												I both love and hate Blood Bowl 2.  The game is very fun and engaging.  It is a solid represenation of the board game and is very loyal to the Games Workshop mythos.  However, sometimes Nuffle is not with you.  There are moments where it seems like you roll double skulls four or five times a match and the other player will get straight double defender downs on every hit. The randomness of it makes it both fun and terrible at the same time.			"

I loved the original game so much i bought it twice but this is a real step back, no real single player campaign game (you can play as one human team in a basic tutorial) and problems with the resolution (no fullscreen) on low graphics settings, for such a basic game this is unacceptable.The multiplayer was fun but swamped with chaos and orc teams which limits variety.***After much consideration i have changed my review to positive. They resolved the issues with resolution and have added a raft of new teams.They have also announced that the LE will have a single player campaign (although i expect you will have to pay for it)			"

												I'd bet axions to artichokes the only negative reviews this game has received have been from players who never experienced the board game.Blood Bowl 2 is my new gold standard in tabletop digitisation.I hope GW grants the devs a comprehensive WH40K digitsation license (even if only to trigger the ruleset refactoring and disambiguation that's been overdue for twenty years).For anyone not familar with Blood Bowl, i strongly recommend reading the rules to avoid tantrums. Blood Bowl is 46% tantrum management. It used to be more than 46% but it seems the days of one's opponent gleefully screeching, ""illegal procedure"" at you and pointing to an overlooked turn counter are gone. A bit like modems. Sort of a shame. But not really.			"

												After playing several Matches I must say that I was not dissapointed. It is a worthy iteration of the Board Game. The only things that seriously bothered me up till now was the repetetiveness of the commentators (Which is a problem almost all sports games have), the pricing of the DLC which forced me to only pick one out of the many teams on offer and a slight disbalance in certain team matchups (Im looking at you Chaos and Nurgle, mind you this i've only noticed due to watching/talking with others and playing one or two matches against them.)Highlight of my Coaching Career:First Turn of the First Game I play on Blood Bowl 2:Most experienced player on opposite team, Picks up ball.Runs to the MaxGoes for IT!Goes for IT!StumblesRe-rollStumblesBreaks Neck, Dead.
