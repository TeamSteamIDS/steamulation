AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Worms Crazy Golf Original Release: 2011 Genre Tags: Sports; Golf; Strategy; Puzzle; Casual; 2D My Overall Grade: B Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 2-10 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Optional Recommended To: Puzzle game aficionados; Casual gamers REVIEWWorms Crazy Golf is a casual, wacky game that focuses on strategy and puzzle-solving in a silly cartoon atmosphere.  Do note: it is certainly more reminiscent of other trajectory-based games, like Angry Birds, rather than any other actual golf games.  If you like silly, simple, trajectory-based puzzle games then you will probably find this enjoyable.To keep things fresh and crazy as you play, different in-level obstacles and utilities (explosive sheep, cannons, teleporters, and such) make appearances in the various levels.  There are also unlockable power-ups which you can equip and use to manipulate the movement of the golf ball.  Using these things, you will find there are various ways to solve each level.Besides just beating the par (in strokes), there are also 20 coins and 1 crate to be collected in each level.  You collect the items by causing the golf ball to move through them.  Everything is cumulative, and you can take as many strokes as you need to collect everything.  So with time and patience you can easily collect everything without having to worry about hitting a wall due to skill level.  There is also a score threshold to beat on each level, which can be reached by taking crazy shots with a lot of airtime and that cause many explosions and such.  There is an achievement for completing all objectives on every course (minus the DLC course).Of course, there are some minor annoyances inherent in the gameplay.  For example, I found it mildly obnoxious that some of the animations couldn’t be skipped; most of them only last a few seconds, but over the course of playing it starts to get old having to wait after every shot before you can take the next one.Worms Crazy Golf is a very casual game.  Once you have access to the power-ups, it’s pretty easy to ace every level with a “hole-in-one.”  The pleasure of the game comes from its silly, easy nature, so don’t expect mind-bending puzzles.  Anticipate approximately 5 hours of gameplay to “beat” each course; if you want to complete all objectives on each course, then that number will probably rise exponentially.  If it sounds like something you would enjoy, get it for a price you are comfortable with and give it a shot.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												Background: I'm a casual fan of Worms game, love everything about it.  I've played golf maybe 10 times or so in real life.  I picked up the game on a humble bundle.This is one sweet game.  You have 4 18 hole courses to play in a 2d platform style.  You choose your club from a driver, iron, wedge or putter, each behave differently and choose your angle and how much power to swing it.You have a few different objectives, you need at least a Par to progress, although later with powerups its common to get hole in ones.  You will need a great mix of strategy, powerups, planning, and luck to get it right.There are 20 coins per level you can collect, these help you to buy other clubs, hats, balls, voices etc.  There is one crate on each level which is needed to help unlock items.  There is also a requirement to get a certain number of points, however this becomes the easiest/lamest to achieve.  If you get a hole in one, you get this straight away.  However in earlier levels I just aimed straight up and hit the ball out of the map repeatedly/or into the sea and got my skill score.Getting all of these challenges on the normal levels will take some planning, but nothing is impossible.  Sometimes you need to wait till you unlock an ability later.There are some seperate challenge maps, eg the ""chip in"" challenge.  If you get the ball on the green you get extra time in your countdown.  If you get it in the hole you get more time.  The ""keep up"" challenges are quite fun, you get only one shot and have to use land mines and other objects on the map to keep the ball moving as many times as possible, you can only choose one powerup to use until it runs out.Most of the achievements in this game will pop normally just playing the game.The best thing about this game, it was always fun, even when I was just smashing the ball straight up in the air.   A great casual game if you have 5 minutes or 2 hours.			"

												For such a low price, I believe this game is possibly the most efficient game in terms of cost:entertainment. It may appear to be a lame videogame for children at first, but this belongs to the 'Worms' series for a reason, and this game is HARD. CORE. Got that? Imagine golf. Now imagine golf with explosives. Cool right? Now imagine golf with explosives and worms. This is the only game you need ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I personally have clocked over a 1,000 hours on this masterpeice and I highly recommend you do the same! It's the name of the game ♥♥♥♥♥. This ain't just Worms Golf, this is Worms CRAZY Golf, and you bet your sorry ♥♥♥ this ♥♥♥♥ is crazy.7.5/10			"

												Well i'll be. Never expected to see a 'Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour' -type of game on PC.  In fact i expected this game to either be a turd or something you need a hefty amount of nostalgia to play.  Turns out nostalgia is not required and game stands on it's own and is done with high production values.  And it's a good but whacky PC equivalent of the before mentioned legendary Mario game that is valid and fun even today 11 years after it's release. So what's it like? Well it has got to do with 'real' golf as much as Elin Nordegren has got to do with Professional  Golfing in the real world and that ain't much - except for collecting lots of gold coins, stuff from crates and generally being an ♥♥♥ on the golf field and hitting on everyone. All levels go approx. the same: first get a score under par to unlock next level. after that you can just go nuts and try to collect and break everything on the level until you get them all.  Doing objectives unlocks stuff you can buy from the shop to 'accessorize' your worm player.  As you progress element hazards such as wind is introduced but you get special items such as rocket boost.  Very realistic yes?			"

												Worms Crazy Golf is 2D golf game. It's heavily based on Worms Reloaded (by looks of the graphics, UI, and more) which is good.+ Simple gameplay (if you have 3 years old son or daughter, he/she can play it if he/she knows how to use keyboard or gamepad)+ Enjoyable with keyboard/mouse as well as with gamepad+ Cute graphics+ Up to 4 players local coop+ Great music background+ Runs on everything that moves+ Good UI+ Has funny achievements+ 0 DLC or microtransactions- No online multiplayer (not even LAN)What should developers learn from this game: that they've done amazing job, and I would totally buy same game with new campaign and online multiplayer.

Great game for a single-player. Too bad you can't play against a CPU.

This game is funny a bit too casual but still great.

In my opinion the game content is way too low even with the free DLC (carnival course) you can easily unlock every level in less then 5 hours.

It's a awesome game if you like worms and if you wanna play golf in a awesome way! "

												For a Worms game, this is oddly the cutest entry of the lot.From the cutesy theme in the title to how happy all the worms are playing a nice game of golf instead of, you know... Trying to blow each other up like they normally spend their time doing.. It is an odd change of pace, but that doesn't make it bad.. I found this game rather charming, really.Worms Crazy Golf is a game that takes the classic Worms system and combines it with golf to make a rather strange, if interesting, hybrid of 2D golf sim, where players try their best to smack a ball all the way to the hole in as few hits as possible, while trying to avoid more Wormish hazards such as mines, sheep, and even grumpy grannies, in time earning items that help make getting that tricky hole-in-one easier.A game about 2D golf might not seem all that interesting at first, but once you give it a wack you find a humble pleasure playing this simple little game. Sadly, as fun as it can be at times, it does suffer from a flaw or two that holds it back from being a rather enjoyable game in the long run.For 10 dollars, the content the game packs is rather meh, a decent player able to beat the game in a few hours. It might have some form of replay value, but it is rather humble in that area. To make matters worst, the game suffers from an awkward balancing issue, being that one of the powers (Reverse Gravity) is by far the most broken item in the game. Upon earning it for the first time, it doesn't take a player long to realise that he can abuse it to get easy holes in one for EVERY course in the game.. I am serious about that, it takes all challege out of a nice little golf game, so if you are the kind of person who seeks a challenge, I suggest you avoid using it if you don't want to spoil your fun. For the egotist, however, it certainly does satisfy the desire for easy glory. I suggest you wait for the game to go on sale for 5 bucks or so before getting the game. It is fun and all, but clearly not worth the current price offered.			"

												If your a fan of worms and a fan of the sport of golf, then this is the game for you! Includes the classic whacky gameplay in humor from the Worms games.  There a objectives that are optional to complete in each level on hole. There are also special abilities you can use to help you improve your score. You can also earn in game cash to customize your Worm( Name, Speech, Balls, Clubs, Hats)!			"

												Yet another game that falls under the ""Bored? Why not this?"" category of games. It is a cute, low-key golf game mixed with the Worms genre. Makes passing time a little easier, and makes for a great local co-op game with a friend when you have nothing better to do.Worms Crazy Golf is not a game I would pay full price for, but it is one I would recommend to anyone who is thinking of getting it, or anyone that owns it already.

3 out of 5The game to play before you sleep.Worms Crazy Golf is a nice little addition to the vast Worms dynasty. With simple but customisable golf playing mechanics, you putt your balls through some endearing 2d cartoony worlds and imagery.Worms Crazy Golf isn't going to set the world on fire. It's the game you play after spending all day playing those AAA amazements and that indie darling you love so much. So whilst it's a nice casual game, it's still a freakin' casual game.			"

												I find this game tons of fun and love it as a relaxing game. The soundtrack is just so soothing it's impossible for me not to have fun. Also worms playing golf is an interesting concept, I like it. It's nice with something different from timing grenades and firing  bazookas against the wind :) The golf courses has multiple ways to be completed, there's also many different ways to play. You can either try to collect everything, get the ball in with lowest hits or both at the same time. I also love how the courses are themed and that there's objects which interact with the ball. There's also power ups.Overall I like this game and would give it a solid 10/10. It is also very fun to play with friends ^~^			"

												I can recommend this game when it is bought on sale or in a bundle (I bought the Team17 Humble Bundle). I think the game should cost around 5 bucks at most, since it can be finished in under 10 hours.The core mechanic is similar to throwing a grenade in a normal Worms game with some twists. After progressing through the levels the golf ball gets upgrades, which the player can choose from. However, when you get the reverse gravity ball, the game becomes way too easy.My opinion, Worms Crazy Golf is an okay single player experience, but for a multiplayer experience, I recommend buying either Worms Reloaded or Revolution (or both), it\'s much more fun.

												Worms Crazy Golf is, as the title suggests, a golf game in Team17's Worms universe. It is not a serious golf game, like for instance Tiger Woods PGA Tour or Links, but a more wacky 2D golfer keeping with the series comical tone and graphical style. Supposedly it is a sequel to the 2004 mobile game Worms Golf, but who cares, right? The object of the game is to complete each hole on par or below par with its par number. If you fail to do so you have to play the hole again. There are three courses (four with the added mini expansion Carnival Course) that contain 18 holes each. Once in awhile you get to play extra challenge levels where the object can be to keep the ball in motion for a certain time or to pop all balloons, etc. These challenges are quite fun and can be a good break from the normal levels. As you progress in the game you unlock power-ups, a couple of which make the game a little too easy. Well, the power-ups combined with the fact that you can steer the ball mid-air by tapping left or right will result in a few hole-in-ones. Some levels have wind and magnetic fields, which ups the difficulty a tad. The levels also contain greenskeeper worms, sheep, bats, moles who steal the ball, and old ladies who strike the ball with their handbags. You collect crates to unlock things in the shop, such as hats or different colored balls, and you collect coins to buy these accessories. The only accessories that alter the gameplay are the golf clubs, so these are worth getting. If you're unlucky, the ball can get stuck inside the ground, though it rarely happens. And if it does happen you can just restart the hole. The game is quite short and can easily be completed in one sitting. Hot seat multiplayer is available for up to four players in true Worms tradition. I found the game pretty enjoyable, a lot better than the puzzle spin-off Worms Blast, but still lacking something to keep it from being just another Worms sidetrack.3 out of 5 worms.			"

												A slightly odd little title that uses the Worms licence as a flimsy excuse to deliver a simplistic 2D golf game. For what it is, it’s highly polished, with great optimisation, visuals achieving a fantastic level of detail, music complimenting the theme of each course, and solid gameplay mechanics that deliver consistency as well as playability. Course design is mostly a success, and encourages risky play - hitting a ball at top speed against a solid wall high above you, for it to bounce back off towards the platform opposite and come to a stop inches away from the flagpost, is a satisfying experience, albeit one that grows old quickly. The game features achievements, which is a great incentive to play, but collecting all 29 of them will probably prove too tedious for all but the most dedicated gamers. Think of it as the Worms variant of Windows Solitaire - fun to play idly for a few minutes, then you’ll want to shut it down and do something else.			"

												ENG:Truly a fun and casual video game, definitely the best video games of different variants of worms, can be played both on its own as the guy in with the same machine, a lot of gameplay and content in the game.FIN:Todella hauska ja rento videopeli, ehdottomasti parhaita erilaisten worms videopelien muunnoksista, peliä voi pelata niin yksinään kuin kaverinkin kanssa samalla koneella, paljon pelattavaa ja sisältöä pelissä.

												Worms Crazy Golf is basically challenge mode ripped out of classic worms and presented as a full game. While it still retain the absolutely flawless physics from the previous games and the very familiar controls, the game’s focus far too much on challenge goals and not enough on insane and over the top worms weaponry and humor. Sure there is parachuting golf balls and reverse gravity, but those are far tame compared to the signature holy grenade, super sheep, and the banana bomb. Level designs are extremely poor with course objective such as coins placed in ridiculous, and in lot of cases, impossible places. I suppose it’s not really a surprise that this is actually an IOS ported to pc. The final slap in the face is that this version is 3 times more expensive than the IOS edition.			"

												I saw this played a REALLY long time ago (Well I guess in 2011 when it came out but...) and saw it was on sale the other day for $.99 and so i bought it in hopes of playing it with one of my friends. Of course what I will tell you next is my fault for not paying attention to this store page, but this game only has local multiplayer (hotseat). If you don't have anybody to play this with at your house, or don't like single player games, then you probably should stay away. After all, the worms games are best suited for multiplayer. Either way, it's solid if you wanna play a 2D golf game. That's all I have to say.			"

												NO, no, No. This is not golf any shape or form. At all. If you think this is golf then your gonna be very disapointed. This is a puzzle game. I suppose Puzzle Golf or Puzzle Putter would have been off putting so they put crazy golf. The only thing crazy is people paying $10 dollar for this game.Its annoying. Let me count the ways. Golf is a game played for a score and each hole is added up at the end and then you have a total score. That is normal golf. Normal golf. This game is not normal golf so  you play the hole, so if you dont get par you must replay the hole again. So thats a negative. The other issue is where the ball is gonna end up at. I have no idea because the game doesnt bother telling you where the ball will end up. So thats annoying. The game explains power ups but doesn give you any!! Thats very annoying. The game could be fun however it ends up feeling like a chore your made to do. Colorful graphics and great sound. The game is ruined by poor mechanics.  Its sad because I was so looking forward to playing this and the more I play the less I want to play. Bad bad bad game.			"

												Hello friends,Welcome to my review on worms crazy golf!i have now played 15 minutes of the game and let met tell you folks this game is a life changer. One day i came home from school and i cried. Anyways, i played this game once after purchasing it on sale i think. So... its aight. kinda cool. i like real worms better. i once red a book called how to eat fried worms. there was also a movie i think. So let me tell ya one time in my 15 minutes of gameplay i made a hole in 2 and god did it make my bits rumble. Ive never felt more adrenaline then when i need an essential chip in to par a hole. I think ill go skydiving one day. I should write reviews on yelp.This game is so realistic that i think im actually at a golf course with crabs and stuff that push my ball away. i dont really crabs. sometimes i buy games and dont play them so the 15 minutes that i played on this game was life changing. and let me tell ya to make a long story short. this game reminds me of my english teacher who made me write an essay and i cried doing it. I like steam. i like the sales too they are cool and stuff.plz subscribe			"

												Hey there, denizen! You're looking at the future game of the year, 15 years from now (maybe)! Let me give you a little background. This game, Worms Crazy Golf, is the spiritual successor to Winnie the Pooh's Home Run Derby (See here : http://www.gamesloon.com/free-sports-12/baseball-games-16/winnie-the-pooh-home-run-derby-54790.html ) and let me just say, it revamps everything. First of all, it features little butterfly characters who just want to learn how to walk. Secondly, the game shifted from Home Run Derby (Baseball) to this, Worms Crazy Golf, which is Hockey based. If you like sports, watching sports, washing sports, swatting sports, etc, you should probably go be active and play Solitaire. Come on and SLAM, and welcome to my PEANUT BUTTER AND JAM. 1/10			"

												Surprisingly fun little casual game. Got this from the Humble Weekly sale and didn't expect much from it, but the typcial Worms gameplay works pretty well in combination with a golf game. There are 4 courses with 18 holes each and a bunch of challenge maps on top of it, enough content to let you play for many hours. If you want to have a bit of Worms fun without playing multiplayer then this is a game for you.			"

												Crazy Golf makes me to say ""change that Worms' genre"" - that means - it's a good spin-off of this Series.Starting with the game - in one opinion - it's a platforming golf with Worms. The players has a task to hit the ball into the hole - like in any golf games. During the flight of the ball player can control it by using spin control or one of six abilities - we can Slow the game, explode the ball to get higher, Parachute it, Reverse the Gravity, make the ball heavy as Cannon Ball or bouncy like a beach ball.Every time you start a hole, you must first take at how many pars you need to move to the next hole (eg. In hole with 5 pars you need to perform at least 5 shoots, otherwise you can get a Bogey). All in all there are 72 normal holes. There's also a challenges which engage on such tasks as destroying the targets or keeping the ball in motion as long as possible.Crazy Golf looks beautiful. Fact that is a graphics from Reloaded, but nothing makes me not enjoy to this 2D World. A lots of humor - that I like in any games.In addition of lack of online multiplayer the only thing I would accuse is the optimization during the spinning the ball. Without using this skill the game runs smoothly, but when I want to direct the ball using spinning, game go down to 14 FPS. Let me add also that some content - such as hats, voices or balls - are unlocked only by collecting crates sometimes hidden in places where is hard to get in first shot.Overall, a game almost pleasant (if a player is upset for penalties). Better it's not to give to Worms Fan who loves playing this series online because it's absence, but for me it is a nice ""relaxing"" game. If you have enough an old turn-based Worms games, but you want to play an another game that isn't a strategy, go buying it.			"

												One might not initially comprehend how a game could combine Worms with a golf game, but they fit together very well. The style is still reflective of Worms, with the new objective of driving the golf ball through Worms-style landscapes to each hole. Obviously, this is far from being real golf, which makes the game more interesting and challenging. Two thumbs up.			"

												Exactly what you'd expect. Golf with a Worms twist. Not sure if it's worth the asking price, but I got it on sale, so it was definitely worth the price I paid. My only real complaint is that you have to unlock each consecutive hole by shooting a par or better before they let you move on.I can understand having to unlock the extra courses but unlocking the holes kind of takes the fun out of the game. Part of the challenge of golf is trying to make up for a poor showing on one hole by doing better on the next. They rob you of that opportunity by forcing you to repeat each hole until you ""pass"" it. Kind of lame, in my opinion.Overall, it's a worthy title, though.			"

												A new take on the classic Worms series hits a Hole in One!Simple 2D golf game based on the typical ""AIM / Power Meter"" mechanic seen in all of the other Worms games, but this time instead of launching missles or tossing holy-hand grenades™, you are swinging your club at a golf ball.   Avoid grazing sheep (who will eat your ball), land mines, and magnets that both push and pull, gophers and even angry old women!Do your best to judge the wind and use some neat power-ups to navigate around the vertical and floating landscape while trying to hit the green and score your best.Simple challenges on each hole create a good bit of re-playability, and Team 17 just released a new course to go with the originals, (now 4 total) for free!Get out there! Grip it and rip it!  I score it an 83%""No such feeling as the well-struck golf shot""  Roy 'Tin Cup' McAvoy			"

												This is most certainly a fun little ""time-waster"", made by the Worms and Alien Breed creators; Team17. Although you might not find yourself playing it for hours on end, it's definitely good to do in small bursts, when you've got a few free minutes.And if you don't think that $10 is an appropriate price, just get it in one of the Worms bundles it's in; those bundles are all worth looking into!

												If you are familiar with the Worms series, this game will look/feel exactly as you would expect.

												For the record, this is not a terrible game. It's just also not great.If you're looking for a crazy/mini-golf game, check out the 3d Ultra Mini Golf game on Steam, or any of the innumerable online 3D crazy golf games. In 2D, this ends up being more akin to Angry Birds though, and if that's what you're looking for there are other options available.My biggest bugbear is the shaky controller support, in that it supports Xbox 360 pads by default but with a few peccadilloes, such as still displaying mouse only controls on the screen, not being able to navigate some menus with the joypad and having to use the D-Pad.Overall, though, I think I was just disappointed at how much like a mobile game and how little like a party game this felt. I couldn't imagine playing this with friends - instead it focuses on a ""collect all the coins"" sort of metagame which takes you out of the mini-golf mindset. It's not badly executed, I just don't particularly enjoy what it does.			"

												Worms Crazy Golf is exactly what it says it is; the game features classic Worms characters, stages, audio, unlockables and customisation in a crazy golf setting. Instead of killing other worms (which you can still do in this game to create bunkers) your objective is to actually navigate the courses using a variety of clubs and unlockable power-ups.The difficulty level does increase quite rapidly around the 2nd course, but this averages out again once you unlock better power-ups shortly afterwards.IIRC, other than the graphical upgrade, the PC version is also slightly different (harder) than the mobile version as some of the pars are lower.A worthy standalone entry to the Worms franchise in my opinion.

												It's just like playing real golf! hitting as many people (worms) with the golfball as possible, collecting money which some golfers dropped because they just have too much, and trying to win by having the most strokes! I am really good in this game just like the real life version! wonder why i always end up last....			"

												I've put about half an hour into this game at the time of this review. So please keep that in mind.I am absolutely surprised by this game. I never expected a good golf game from the Worms series, and yet, this game proved me wrong! It reminds me of the little golf games in browser I would play when I was younger. There is a lot of strategy involved, and if you don't focus you might miss your shot! It's also a fun game to play when you are just waiting for friends or just have nothing else to do. It's also very relaxing, so you can play it at any time. Not to mention, the music is quite good.Sometimes the voices can get repetitive, but hey, one con ain't bad.Definitely recommend! I do not regret my purchase.			"

												Worms Crazy Golf is a light hearted mini-golf game that holds up well in both single player and local co-op.  You’ll know if you want this game. Either you enjoy the Worms series and/or enjoy mini-golf games. It features 4 full courses with a good variety in level design and difficulty. I won’t go into this point much, as like other mini-golf games, there will be traps, obstacles and power ups along your way to creatively finish the hole and gather all the collectibles.Collectibles! Each hole has 4 objectives. Collect all the coins, get par or better (required to unlock the next hole), collect the crate and get a high score (usually more than 100k). Figure that in to 72 holes and that’s a lot of collectibles. It does provide a good challenge and gives the game some replay value as far as single player is concerned. You can either play by yourself or up to 4 people in local co-op (sitting at the same computer). There is no LAN option for multiplayer. I think it’s worth saying they put out an entire course as free DLC. Always nice to see that. I had two minor complaints that I’ll expand on. First was the constant zoom in on the player at the start of each hole and also during different strokes. The default camera is too close so I had to constantly zoom out so I could see where I was going on any particular hole. I wish it either saved your zoom level or had a slider option for “default zoom level”.Second were the animations between shots. Where your worm would either scoot over to the ball or be transported. These became fairly annoying to sit through constantly. I would have loved an option to either speed these up or disable them. It would have made gameplay much faster. This is especially noticeable when playing a multiplayer game.On to the pros/consPros+Graphics are nice, sharp and vibrant. Scales well to 1440p+Smooth 60fps throughout+Fun courses, well designed+Good multiplayer (local co-op only)+Replay value+Collectibles to extend game length+Free DLCCons+Music & sound effects repetitive+Zoom reset after each hole and after some strokes+Animations between shots are slowThis is a great, casual game you can pick up if you or your friends are bored. The $10 asking price isn’t too bad considering the replay value is there with multiplayer support and if you want to complete all the holes 100% it will take a good amount of time. 7/10 Good. Above average			"
