												A lot of fun, as long as you know what to expect.  It's a pitching machine throwing batting practice.  But get a bunch of people together competing on this one and it's awesome.			"

												This game got old in 4 min, I actually had to start it up again and let it sit there, just to get 5 min so i could write this review. It is not worth $9, it would hardly be worth $2. This game feels like it is riding the VR wave and plays like it was made in a weekend. If you hit the button above the touchpad repeatedly you can teleport yourself out of the arena. It is really great since there isn't a pause menu so you have to let the clock run out everytime if you accidentally hit the button and then can no longer hit any of the pitches. Do not buy this game, save your money.			"

												We had a lot of fun with this one.  Swinging a bat in VR feels good.   It's a great use of the tracked controllers and also a nice introduction for people new to VR.  The experience is very comfortable with no sudden movements.  Knocking one out of the park always gets a smile.  There are fun options like hitting a beach ball and tennis ball.  Everyone who's played seems to have a different swinging style - you can use one or two hands, and people really get into it.  This is one where you just might want to put on the wrist straps!			"

												I really like this game. Feel is great, and very cool stadium atmosphere.It's basically just batting practice, so don't expect much more than that.Couple of things on my wish list...-- I do wish you could crank up the speed another level or two. :)-- Would be cool to have different lengths and diameters of bats.-- Oh, also please remove the stadium change from the grip buttons. Too many accidental changes.Big baseball fan, so I dig it. :)			"

												Good fun and addictive, Beachball is my favourite mode because I like getting massive homeruns. The different stadium backgrounds look really cool and the bat skins have a big selection. The developer is really kind and helpful and has taken into consideration features I suggested (for example adding in room recentering) and has fixed bugs I found.I highly recommend this game.			"

												Fun little home run derby sim.  Thats all it really is, but it does it well.  I would LOVE some actual options to tweek things like the time between pitches so i can enjoy some of my long home runs.  Also, some actual pitching would be nice.  Instead of the same pitch over and over, i would love to be challenged with some breaking pitches and location changem in a seperate mode of course..			"

												It says it in the Title. It's a Home Run Derby game. If you like the concept, you will enjoy this game. It's not a full baseball game and isn't meant to be.Really fun to take turns with friends to try to beat each others scores.			"

												Great game if you've ever enjoyed going to a batting cage in real life. Its literally the same exact experience aside from feeling the weight of the bat. The only thing thats missing is a restart button. If you're leaderboard chasing and dont start with 4-5 homers in a row you might as well give up and just wait the 50 seconds for it to restart. Gets a little annoying.			"

												Love this game, it's a whole lot of fun.  Pro mode was really hard, but I made it to top of the leaderboards after a few rounds.  The golf mode is fun too.  My kids seem to really have a blast hitting beach balls as well.  Definitely recommend it!			"

												**Overdue update:**As of writing this, I have to say that my opinion of this game has changed. The developer has released several updates polishing existing content, and adding more. The game has also been updated quite consistently, and definitely appears to be on track to improve even further. Additionally, I have to apologize for my lack of understanding as to what the purpose of this game is. It is as it advertises, a Home Run Derby, and contains even more fun goodies beyond that. So overall, my negative views of this game have made a complete 180. If you're looking to take a trip to the batting cages and whack some balls around, I absolutely recommend this as your go-to.------------------------------------------Let me start by saying that I don't enjoy giving negative feedback on VR experiences this early in the industry's lifespan. I think most content has redeeming qualities, and anything made well in VR is good for VR. Home Run Derby is a well put together game. There's no motion sickness, and everything it claims to do works. That having been said, I personally cannot recommend this title to the average user. It is essentially batting practice, and as such there are minimal mechanics. Balls are launched to you at set intervals, and you hit them. You can change the ball size, and background. But that's about it. There does not seem to be a goal or a challenge beyond just hitting as many balls as far as you can. It grows stale quickly, and I would not be able to justify its price for its experience. The visuals are also very unpleasant, and the audio effects are grating. If you like baseball and enjoy going to actual batting cages, then this will be a good game for you. If you're just looking for a sports game to spend a lot of time in, then it likely won't be. As a free title, it's worth a download. For the nearly $10 asking price, I'd definitely pass.			"

												This was a fun experience and great for some friendly competition with some friends over! A great way to share a headset with a few people over to pass around the headset for short games. At first I thought I didn't have enough room for it (I have a tight space right now) and then realized I could hit the menu button to adjust the plate and make better use of my space. Definitely recommend for some quick fun!			"

												This is the best VR Baseball game available. Perfect mechanics. Several environments to choose from. Developer was great to talk to, as well. That never hurts. It has realistic modes and ridiculous modes, but it's always a workout. I can't recommend this one enough.			"

												This game is way to expensive for what it is. It isn't worth even $5 for a game that just throws balls at you and you hit them. Theres no score boards or anything. I asked for a refund because it was so boring. Usually I don't do that but it was a must for this game...			"
