												So, this is a somewhat challenging game actually. Basically, a meteor lands in a cemetary and is the impetus for the dead rising from the grave. The only way to defeat them? Bowling, Obviously....sheesh. :)Anyway, you basically bowl against a zombie, and all the pins are zombies. There are buffs you can gather and use (which include large balls, rockets, plunger guns, etc...), and also penalties you can pick up and use against your zmbie competitor. Of course, it also gets the same opportunities to use buffs and hit you with penalties. They include icy lanes, narrow lanes, obstacles, and so on.Your goal? To win each match and move on the the next lane. You get a day and night for each lane, so you will bowl each twice. If you lose, you have to try again until you win.You can adjust the position of release as well as the ball speed before/as you throw.That is pretty much it. Although this probably doesnt sound all that impressive, the game is actually a lot of fun. I cant imagine a person playing it and deciding they didnt like it. It's just cute, good casual bowling. Also fit for all ages.7/10			"

												Zombie Bowl-o-Rama is nothing special, but might pass some idle time while you're on a long conference call. It feels very much like a well-crafted mobile game. The game consists of you bowling down a lane full of zombies, overcoming obstacles and traps like water on the bowling lane and deploying tricks that you earn to improve your game. The controls are okay, but odd. You use the mouse to adjust the power behind your roll and then once the ball is out of your hands, you directly control its movement with the mouse -- moving left to right.It's an idle-time amusement and little more. Not worth the price, but not a broken or terrible game. If you're into this kind of thing, I'd wait until it hit a buck or two before buying. That's about the price of a decent iPad game and that's about what this is.			"

your out bowling and the zombie apocalypse happened so what do you do?replace the pins with zombies of course.after you toss the ball you can sway it back and forth and the missed zombies will wander down the lane (they are no real threat).this game is more about the power ups than your skill and there are tones of them about 25.this adds a strategy angle to the game of when and if you should use a power up or save it for a particular hindrance or the final frame.

												I played this game with my son so much when he was 3 years old.  This game is very fun for a bowling game.  Bowl for zombies rather than bowling pins and use special powerups to help with the process.  There's one trick though, your opponent gets to place powerups that harm you such as a narrow lane, oil slicks, etc...  Fun times on a twist to a simple casual bowling game.			"

												Weird and Suprisingly EnjoyableThis game is indeed very strange. Bowling and Zombies are not exactly the sort of things you would imagine would go well together and yet, here we are with 'Zombie Bowl-O-Rama' from Mumbo Jumbo, proving me totally wrong.Why does it work so well? Its simple, it just adds so much crazy and fun to each scene, imagine chucking a giant lettuce against a bunch of disco dancing zombies or sending bees everywhere sliding a honey-ball across a icy path. It makes no sense but it happens to also be so playable too, simple controls keeping things very accessable.As you can see I am slightly having issues with what to exactly say. I guess all I can say is 'Lets Go Bowling for Brains!'			"

												I know what you're thinking: Holy crap, this game looks really stupid!Well, it is stupid, but it's also fun.  In most cases, video game bowling sucks (I've never been a fan of REAL bowling, either), but this game has a nice twist to it.  While rolling your ball down the lane, you can somewhat control it and when doing so, you can grab different positive and negative items.Positive items help YOU, whereas negative items hurt your opponent, which can be a real person or the AI.  This adds a whole new dynamic to the game and turns what could've been a real flop into something quite entertaining.There are achievements (if that means a whole lot to you) and a ""normal"" bowling mode, just in case you don't want to deal with crazy game items.  I don't know WHY you'd want to do that, but it's there.You can play against a real person if you want.  This is restricted to local gameplay on ONE PC, so you can't bowl against anyone online.			"

												My review and suggestion is solely based on this game advertised as a single player game.  As a multiplayer game, I would rate it very differently.  But since its advertised as a single player game, and that is why I bought it, that is how I'm scoring it.The tricks and power ups are very similar to mario kart.  They allow you to boost your game and weaken your enemies.  This is great when playing against friends who will struggle with the same mouse controls that you have.  But, when playing against AI, it just plain sucks.  The computer is not phased by the tricks you throw at it while you get blown out when the AI uses tricks against you.  You can throw tricks against it frame after frame and it will still bowl 200+ games.  But the super sensitive mouse controls will have you struggling even without the AI's interference.  The AI also seems to luck into the tricks much more frequently which seems to be how they scale difficulty as you advance in single player, making an already frustrating game unbeatable.  Its a cute and gimmicky concept, but when you want to advance the single player functionality, its frustrating, buggy, and eventually very boring.The game is lacking simply options like difficulty sliders, options to skip animations automatically, and how tricks/powerups should work.Its all about the money.  If you find this in a bundle, its worth a small distraction.  However, I would not recommend paying full price, or even buying it alone as its replay appeal is very brief and its single player implementation is very poor.  As I stated above, if you are playing against other human characters, this might be a very fun game (please keep that in mind when reading reviews).			"

												Zombie Bowl-O-Rama. What's there to say really? It's a bowling game where you can pickup various power-ups on the lanes. The power-ups are both offensive and defensive with the offensive ones varying in power between forcing a gutter ball and being completely useless and the defensive ones vary between guaranteeing a strike and guaranteeing a spare.There is not really much else to say about this game, it is very short, simple and random.Do you like Bowling? Do you like Zombies? Do you like Randomness?Unless the answer to all three is a resounding ""HELL YEAH"" then you should stay away from Zombie Bowl-O-Rama because that's all it really is, and it's not particularly good at any of it either.

												Not worth it. The campaign only takes 45 minutes to complete. All you do is bowl against an ai zombie opponete for half a dozen games. Your unseen zombie opponet doesn't scale. They're just as hard or easy to beat in the first game as they are in the last. Unless you want to play another six games in a row there's no reason to play it again after that. The powerups add a fun element to the game (either helping you or screwing over your opponet). But there's no online multiplayer. Shared computer or pc opponetes only.			"

												If you're looking for a bowling simulator: Get out. You will NOT find that here. This game is nowhere NEAR to a bowling simulator like Brunswick.While I won this game on the Steam Auction house (the Steam Winter Sale 2014 promotion) I still showed interest in this game regardless if I won it or not. So, the story line is simple: There is none. It's literally just challenges against CPU opponets that get progressively harder as your background and lane change. Or you can opt to bowl against friends, or CPU robots that don't get harder (the non-story mode)There is NO BLOOD OR GORE, while there is dismemberment, it's nothing gruesome like in Mortal Kombat or any other violent game that support dismemberment in a very vicious and violent manor. The pins are zombies. They function as if you hit a human with very thin bones in the shin with a bowling ball. Powerups are such bs in this game, but it's definitely what makes this game fun. You can pick them up while throwing the ball down the lane (It's like Polar Bowler, if you've ever played that game) and then use them to either give yourself a boost or give your opponet a little harder challenge (based on your powerup you collected) While gameplay is simplistic, the bowling ball is even more simplistic. You guide where your ball goes using the mouse. While i'm not too fond of this mechanic, it can definitely make or break your frame.Good, fun, time killer - 8/10			"

												Got this in a cheap bundle and it is my favourite of those in the bundle so far. It is very casual and is a great game to play for 30mins. It certainly is worth getting cheap and if you have friends that'll enjoy it with you then even the full price isn't too bad.The 'story mode' part was a little easy and the story was almost non-existent. But as a bit of occasional fun it succeeds.It'd probably be even more fun with other people and would get a little boring in single player after a little while.If you have ever wanted to take down zombies with a bowling ball this is the game for you!

It's a casual, easy(ish) to pick up bowling game, with powerups and all.Different game types - whilst they not vary too much, still provide a nice amount of variety in terms of gameplay.Where I say ish in terms of the ability to pick it up, the controls at first seem rather wonky, and as my younger cousin says ""Can I turn down the mouse?""After you learn the controls, which aren't really hard to learn at all, it is overall a fun game and worth the buy, although only if you have additional person to play aswell.

			While the theme was fun and the zombies marching down the lane was a new mechanic, the core bowling gameplay just isn't up to snuff.

												The Nintendo 64 was out in 1996, this game....in 2006.... looks and plays like an earthworm jim 3d mini game. good thing I got it for free. Even if I didn't I would pay you a spare steam trading card for it, certainly not ten dollars. On the good side, it is a bowling game with powerups and it works, and the AI only ♥♥♥♥♥ out occasionally. If the multiplayer works, and you actually want to play this crap, add a dollar to the nickel the game is probably worth.Recommended Price: 5 CentsScore (taking into account it was made in 2006): 3/10			"

												Zombie Bowl-o-Rama Review - Raymond KTSummary: From the depths of the graveyard... a gruesome gang is in search of brains! The Zombies have taken over your favorite lanes, and it's up to you to send 'em back to the graveyard where they belong! Select a colorful character to take on the attacking Zombies with your favorite ball and a few tricks and treats. Give a whole new meaning to Zombie strike when you set 'em and take 'em down with cool power ups and tricky obstacles.In short, it would take two humans deliberately missing every shot to ever be in jeopardyA pretty fun game...not really for the hardcore bowler though. There is no picking up pins from splits (if not using power ups). This game is less of a bowling game more of a power-up based vs. game. But its got its fun moments. It's my first bowling game on PC and I'm confused. Firstly, it is casual, simple and funny game with many power-ups and good ideas (thanks God for mouse aiming). On the other side the game is based on luck, not skills which are important in all kinds of sports. I totally understand that it's the arcade vision of bowling but, seriously, give us a chance to show our skills. Additionally, it contains of one, maybe two songs and has cheerful but low resolution graphics which can hurt your eyes. "

												Bowling with zombies is alot of fun in this game because it adds a creative twist to the game with all the perks that you can acquire while bowling. The zombies have personality that puts a smile on your face when you hit them with the bowling ball. It can get frustrating when your opponent throws something in your way to block or make it hard to make a strike with your ball. Its a really fun bowling game that i suggest to anyone in the mood for a good bowl around.  "

												This game is a rather fun, if short and humble, halloween themed bowling game. While the pricetag by default will certainly scare away people looking for a game with plenty of future replay value, if you can get this for 2 bucks, it'll easy make back the hours of entertainment.This ""scary"" bowling game is more of a party game than a serious bowling game (In some ways, Rock-Paper-Scissors meets bowling), where you gather powerups scattered about on the lane you bowl upon while attemping to knock down as many shambling dead as you can. Between turns, you can deploy various powerups that can either hinder your foe or help you, but your rival can do the same as well. There is a modest about of thinking required when it comes to picking the right powerup for the right time, as well as preparing yourself to counter what hazards your rival might use against you.. While it does make the game much more fun in a way, it can also make things somewhat frustrating due to the randomness of itemdrops. You might get lucky and get a good powerup, or you don't.. Your rival might end up getting all the good items while you are left with worthless junk, and at times it really is all down to luck more than skill.. But thankfully most of the time I played, I had a satisfying experience... Well, besides my poor ears, which had to deal with the awful background noise drowing out the decent music with no way to turn it off without taking out all the sounds, but oh well, give and take I suppose.Great game for when you want to kill an hour or two, but only if you are willing to wait to get it on sale.. It is fun, but I doubt it'll keep you hooked for very long.			"
