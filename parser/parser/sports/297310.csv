Early Access Review
								DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU HOPE TO START STOMPING AND PILE DRIVING AWAY.This game is in SUPER early access Alpha stage.So far there is only one playable wrestler with only 2 attacks, basic punch and a grappling brain buster.There is no BGM or Sound FX. So if you want music, be prepared to launch the Steam music player. LOL.If you buy this game now, the only benefit you will get is being a part of the development process and helping give the devs input on what they can add and do to improve the game.I honestly think this game won't be finished for at least another year or so. But at least the devs got the foundation done.They are at least honest enough to admit that what the game offers now is extremely limited, in it's beginning stages and nowhere near done.Let's just hope the devs come through and don't pull an incident like the devs of The Stomping Land... smh, everytime I think of that game.But if the devs for Pro Wrestling X pull through, we are in for a bada$$ wrestling game to look forward to in the future. :DRemember buying this game now is at your own risk.Good luck to the devs making this game.

								READ FIRST: Recommendation is conditionalThe developers have a lot of passion for pro wrestling, but progress can be very slow. It is a very small team that is working on this game. They are definitely working, slowly but surely. But only buy it at this point if you want to watch how a wrestling game is made. This is nowhere near a full release yet, and there's no estimation on when that might be. Some people have been following this game for over a year. Do not buy this if you're looking for the full experience. Updates have become more frequent in the last month or so. Which means more holds have been added as well as basic blood.The developers have an active Twitch account and they send out emails every week to their followers detailing their progress.As of this writing, current features include:-3 Wrestlers (2 masked and 1 basic unmasked default)-A ring editor (change ropes, mat, posts, apron color)-A wrestler editor (mix and match parts from the 3 premade wrestlers available)-Basic Grappling, Strikes, Submissions and Pins (very small movesets so far)-Blood was just added (static splotches, not dynamic or physics based)-Screenshot mode-Options menu-Controller support (xbox 360 controller)-Turnbuckle moves-Crowd-Stage			"

								It's barely a video game at this point, and this is 9 years into development. You click play, it drops you in the ring, you can do a suplex, punch, or pin. That's it. That's the entire game. You can't lose, the enemy can't pin, and it doesn't even count to 3. There's just a random coin toss when you pin someone that if you win or he kicks out.I get that it's early access, but this is a concept stage at best. This is the sort of thing one guy could do in a few days and it's costing you $9.99 on steam.Stay away and wait for it to come out. (if that ever happens)			"

Early Access Review
								Pro Wrestling X is a very difficult game to like, at the moment of this review it's as basic and bare bones as can be humanly possible.  The game is rather stiff feeling, and clearly needs quite a bit of animation work to bring it in line with the intended dream of making a modern day version of the Aki series of wrestler games from the late 90's back to life.  If you had a Nintendo 64 and were into wrestling (when wrestling was at it's peek, you played some of those Aki games)  you played some of those games.  Whether it was the huge rosters, or the ability to create some of your favorite super stars (Was really easy to create characters that resembled their real life counterparts because the graphics were kind of poo poo and blurry)  you played them like they were going out of style.  I'm sure many people like myself popped in your gameshark and fired up some codes, change the ring mat, unlock extra wrestler slots as permanent wrestlers who didn't count against the CAW slots, heck I even seem to recall unlocking The Big Show wrestle-mania 2000 after he was removed from the game and sent back down to OVW for his weight issues.    With that said, Pro Wrestling X has a long way to go before it begins to even slightly resemble the Aki games, but (almost always a but)  the developers have passion, and seem to be trucking away.  (Rather slowly but the project isn't abandoned)  Does the game need work, in the words of the immortal Stone Cold Steve Austin..  ""Oh hell yeah"" but I think given the time and money this game could be a shining beacon of success..   With that said, if you don't buy into the dream you should avoid this product until a later date.  I would call this game more of a demo version, rather than a full fledged game.  You can play it for sure, but using the same 3 wrestlers and 1 wrestler you can edit gets boring, the lack of fluid in the motions is nothing like the Aki games which glided like a hot knife through butter. My personal hopes for the gameSure up character movements and animations, the buttons seem rather sluggish and that makes the game rather un-fun to play, I'm not personally sure if it's an animation issue or a button imput issue, but pressing a button and having the game wait 3 seconds to carry out that action makes the game feel much worse than it really is.Create more wrestlers, it gets really boring playing with 3 wrestlers...  If you had a bit more variety in wrestlers a person could overlook most of the technical limitations and still let the game carve out it's own niche.  As it stands right now, 3 generic masked wrestlers (albeit very well designed and cool looking wrestlers) leave the gamer saying meh, I don't really have any reason to play. Work on adding some additional match types, maybe a hardcore match with weapons would do the trick, give us fun things to do, which protect against the negative aspects of the game-play, until those issues get worked out.  Nothing major, but the more additions the less likely people will be to notice the glaring issues the game has.  Give us some replay value for the money we plunk down, meat and potatoes can be a good distraction.Add in some additional music tracks.. (I loved the one looping music track, absolutely loved it) the one track included was really awesome... like banging my head while throwing up my devil horns and banging my head awesome, but after it loops for the third time, you're left going... ugh, I don't think I like this song as much anymore.. Cut the music during the matches and add in some sound effects, I understand the music is there to cover the fact that no sound effects are in place for matches, but that will help immerse us in the product.  Is commentary of some sort planned for the future, I don't recall the Aki games having commentary, but at the very least including the mat hits, punches, kicks, and splats would go a long way. My recommendation I'm going to recommend this game (I know, I know, it sounds like I'm trashing it right?)  Well I'm not, I think the potential for a wonderfully amazing retro wrestling game is there, it's sitting there, a few updates and additions away from poking it's glam 80's metal hair band head out of the ring, throwing some punches, doing a few suplex's and telling the haters to SUCK IT!!!!  This game needs ALOT of work, it's a real mess right now, but it has potential, and developers who seem to care and have a real passion for bringing this dream to reality.If you aren't willing to support development and wait.. (probably a LONG LONG) time, I'd suggest not buying the game right now.  For people who want to make an investment and help fund and support a wrestling gamer fan's dream I'd fully recommend buying this game and waiting for a few more patches to really pass judgement.  The game's cost of $9.99, may seem like a lot compared to other games you can get on steam for the same price, but the major difference is none of them are aiming to deliver a preeminent throw back wrestling experience.   If you remember the attitude era, you remember DX telling everyone to SUCK IT!!!,  Manking winning the WWF championship and WCW spilling the beans live on the air, resulting on WWF Raw putting out some of their best ratings ever, this game will probably eventually have you feeling like Val Venus, (not when Val was having his member threatened by Kai n Tai, but when he was saying HELLLOOOO LADIES)  and loving it.. Trust me when I say, right now this game is like a new born baby, just starting to open it's eyes, seeing light for the first time, getting a robust slap on the behind to kick start the crying..  Just remember while you may feel like a loser for owning this game in it's current state, if someone tries to speak negatively about you because of it, just remind them, ""YOU WERE NUMBER 1 ONCE IN YOUR LIFE"" that glorious day you won the race up the birth canal.. Much like you developed into an amazingly talented young man, with a great job, a beautiful wife, and 2 1/2 adoring children, this game will eventually bloom into a beautiful flower.  If you don't have ADHD and expect it to get there over night.. or this year, or possible even in 10 years, just know it will probably get there at some point before the females at your favorite strip club begin to call you grey bush..

Early Access Review
								Before I get directly into my review I'll post some information so a person can really understand something about Pro Wrestling X.  The game has been in development for a very long time.  In fact it had a failed kickstarter over 3 years ago..  and was being talked about for a few years prior to the failed kickstarter  So we'll be kind and say it's been in development for 3 years, the store page says the release date was Nov 2014, but it's been in development for far longer than that. The game is supposed to mimic a the Aki styled wrestling games, WWF No Mercy, WCW vs NWO, etc etc etc..  These games came out over 16 years ago!!!!  16 year old tech.Unfortunately for Pro Wrestling X, the long development time hasn't translated into a good game, or much of a game at all.  The game is in Early Access because of that some wiggle room should be given, but with each successive patch the game gets closer to it's full release, the current patch 0.94, seems to suggest the next patch will be the one that takes it out of Early Access. This game is no where near ready for full release, it has a grand total of 3 wrestlers....  3!!!!,,  The movements and controls are stiff and kind of rancid in all honesty.  Aki games were smooth, fluid, and even though the graphics weren't all that good, the games were amazingly fun to play. This isn't a game as much as a concept, it's like a tech demo of something someone would put togther to show off what they wanted to do in a finished product.  The game features 3 match types, single vs single, triple threat and a 4 way.   The game has 3 wrestlers and 1 CAW slot wrestler that you can edit.When judging this game it needs to be understood that this is a game based on tech from 16 years ago...  I can't fathom how this project can be so bare bones, unpolished and unfinished as it's been in development for over 3 years.  I can't hate on the developers though, they have passion, and really talk like they want to make a memorible game, unfortunately I think this should have stayed as someone's pet project, it really doesn't belong on steam.  I'm not sure if the problem is a lack of developers, a lack of money, lack of time or some combination of all of them.I think at this point any new comers should be very leary about buying into this idea, the developement time is running at a snails pace, and you could very well see your 10 dollar investment turn into a 10 dollar loss.  As a hugh Aki fan it saddens me that this game is in such a poor state, I think it's a safe bet to assume many of gamers are tired of the same old garbage WWE game which gets released yearly which feels super arcady.  We want a real simulation wrestling game, and unfortunately Pro Wrestling X isn't going to be that game... atleast not for quite a few years, if at all.. "

Early Access Review
								EDIT: So I will update this since apparently since some guy sucking up to the developers is going around posting ""oh this is outdated! This game is actually updated now!!!"" on every single outdated review, and the dev is bragging about updating now.  This game has changed a little since November.  There are a few new moves, a momentum meter, and basic AI logic.  Those are your ""many updates"" you're parading around and bragging about.  That's what's been added in the last 9 months. There have been excuses as to why development has been slow and I understand that things happen, but we're talking about the decision as to making a purchase here.  This game is $10.  It's been clear that people aren't necessarily purchasing a game, but a promise.  A small handful of updates recently does not absolve the huge gap of nothing but excuses.  $10 is purchasing a promise that is not guaranteed to come true and it is a HUGE risk to buy in on this promise that has a long history of disappointment and very little to show for it.I'm also sick of hearing this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t of ""We've been updating sometimes twice per day lately"" because I distinctly remember hearing something along the lines of 'we're updating more than most early access titles"" back in November.  That is just offensive. People bought in because of that statement thinking this was going somewhere and all we got were excuses.  You go and make this new statement and more people see some minor updates, buy in, and then what?  9 more months of excuses.  This game does not update frequently.  ARK: Survival Evolved updates frequently.  Getting to this minor milestone of being able to have a 1/2 star match after 9 months is not a worthwhile investment that should be recommended to potential buyers.  I'm sorry but it's not.  There's not even a manageable UI at this stage.  Discovering the controls is pure guesswork.  That should have been a priority above anything else. You added more moves without telling people how to actually DO them!Look, I get it, this is a small developer trying to make a big game, but Early Access is Early Access.  It has the good side and the bad side.  The good side are your games like ARK, that are updated daily, released in a playable semi-polished state that improves steadily.  Pro Wrestling X is the bad side of Early Access.  It's the game that goes on hiatus immediately after it becomes available for purchase, doesn't update for months, and after 9 months of development, has very little to show for it. I know ARK has a big team and all and PWX has like 2 and a half people, but it doesn't change the fact that they both have the same title of Early Access and one is worth the investment while the other isn't yet.I stand by my original review.  This game DOES have potential, but the promise of a game is just too risky to invest in at this point.  Bragging about updates and having pathetic white knights downvote and comment on outdated reviews does nothing to make this product worth purchasing.  It's only trying to hide and mask the current state of this game that's not worth investing in (in my opinion) so that more people will buy the game (because ""oh hey the bad reviews are downvoted, they must be wrong! Also, Updaetz!"")I will update the review when my opinion changes, and if that happens, it will bring me great joy.  I want this game to succeed but as of right now I do not recommend this game, and going around downvoting and posting on 5-month-old reviews does nothing to make me feel better about the product that I invested in as soon as it came on Steam.Original Review Below from March 30, 2015:Very basic and shows promise, but since the game was put on steam there have been *EDIT* A Few *END EDIT* updates and a whole bunch of empty promises.  Hopefully it gets better with time, but right now, I would recommend to stay away and just follow the game until it gets to something resembling the developers' vision.  It's not worth playing in its current state and it DEFINITELY isn't worth $9,99			"

Early Access Review
								(Edit - Review has been edited on the 23rd of April 2016 to re-look at the current version (0.94) on that day and a new updated video for that version has been added at the end of my review).If you believe in wrestling games out side of WWE or even more wrestling games in general then this project is worth buying and sitting on until it growths into it's very small boots, that might take a while since currently we can do a match but not the most fun one ever but it is heading in the right direction.Pros --Good looking wrestlers.-Nicely animated moves.-The sharpshooter is in :)-Blood is know in.-Very Basic Create a wrestler and ring mode both in.- 3 way and 4 way matches - Interference (One wrestler will run down to attack you or your opponent in single match's) - CrowdsCons --Only 3 wrestlers needs more (you can create a 4th so getting better).-Needs a lot more moves (more is being added got moonsaults and back moves know added for example).-Hit detection is far from perfect. (seems to be worst compared to last time I undated my review but more wrestlers in the ring at the same time seems to be the problem so hopeful sorted next patch).- Interference (As in having the same wrestler attacking you for example Grasshopper is in the ring vs Grimhold then Grasshopper runs out to attack Grasshopper needs to be a different wrestler to the two in the ring).-Needs more of lot things in fact, Match types (has got single and 3 way and 4 way matches know so improving), create modes (these are starting to enter the game in a very basic form, but getting more advanced every patch it seems),crowds (Are in but still very basic can be improved a lot), arenas (Same arena but we can change things like colours and logos in game as well as simple moding allows us to swap out signs and similar things by replacing the files with the same name etc), referees (still non) etc.I have added a vid of the current build what is 0.752 so you can see if it is worth buying for you out there right now.

								I have made a video to show potential buyers everything the game currently offers as Early Access. http://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/game-tutor-examines/141127_gmae-tutor-examins-pro-wrestling-xWhile I am very clear of what early access is I worry that this game is currently so early in development the release of an early access at this stage will hamper the game. I decided not to produce a review as I hope and pray this game will end up good but at this current moment in time I feel it is far too early to tell and it should never have been released even as an early access in this state.I really hope I can change this to positive somewhere down the line.

								If you are looking to scratch that old AKI wrestling game itch, this is the game for you.This is made by a small team, but they are making leaps and bounds in their updates. The last few updates added a steel cage match and rag doll physics. Everything is still early in development and they are still working out the fundamentals of the game, but I can already tell this is going to be the AKI game I've been waiting for.There aren't many moves or grapples in place yet, but for $9.99, you get to see what it would be like if AKI was still around making wrestling games. PWX has the same feel of those games, but with updated graphics and gameplay mechanics (for the better).			"

When the game enters a feature-complete state (final version), a detailed review will be posted.Pros:- Fans of N64's No Mercy will feel like home when playing this- Dedicated team of developers with a deep passion for wrestling- Great community, filled with great fans of pro wrestling- Smooth and pitch perfect animations- Currently worth more than the cheap pricetag (9,99)- Impressive character and object models- Three unique, original and completely well made characters- Modding is awesome in this game, and it will only improve- Many options right now, more than you could expect in an alpha game- The game has come a long way since it's first build- Great vision from the developers for the future (unique features, workshop and other cool stuff)Cons:- Still very early in development- Currently in need of serious work in the transitions between animations (will be fixed)- Current build, as of April 21st 2016 requires a better than average PC (will be optimized later)Pros/Cons (depending on the player):- Anti-PG game, you will see blood and ""GOOREEEE"" (not for kids)- No Mercy's style of controls			"

								My view of the game is positive, but as of the current state only for those who want to support the project.  Regardless of the version number, this game has a long way to go before being a release for mass consumption.  It is an incredibly limited experience right now in regards to match types, attack/grapple variety, appearance, and small touches such as the fixed camera angle, the inability to leap over a downed opponent while walking/running, etc.  From all appearances the game is far better than the initial steam release, and the team does care about feedback from those who purchase.  I am hoping for the best with this project, and look forward to a more complete experience down the road.			"

Early Access Review
								--- UPDATE 7/8/2015 ---Whilst I still can't recommend this to those looking for a more content-complete game, spurred by the response to my review I was hugely pleased to replay this title and find that there have indeed been some significant updates, and that they are coming far more frequently. On playing the latest build of the game released yesterday, whilst there aren't a great number of moves available, the basic gameplay features and systems felt and looked far, FAR better than before, making it feel a lot more like there's a sturdy framework present for the developers to build on. Definitely had my excitement with this title reinvigorated.I am hugely appreciative to have recieved a response from the developers acknowledging my concerns, and I really hope they can keep up this frequent update cycle. I wish them all the best and hope that all goes well from here on out, if they can keep up any sort of frequent bug fix/content updates and avoid another very lengthy drought they could have a great title on their hands.--- ORIGINAL REVIEW CIRCA MAY 6TH ---Do not buy at present. This game is very much an Early Access title, with a barebones framework currently in place - a barebones framework that hasn't seen any updates since late 2014.- Before I go on, I'd like to say that I will gladly change this review once any substantial updates are made to the game. -I appreciate that events occur that hamper development, but I've been rapidly losing patience with this game for some time now, and this is coming from a Kickstarter backer. I knew what I was getting into, but I didn't think updates to the game itself would be THIS scarce. I appreciate there is a small team developing this title, but six+ months with no public updates to the game itself isn't good for a team of any size or budget. This has been exacerbated for me by the way the game is discussed in the Wrestling Gamers United newsletter run by the developers - whilst I understand that the newsletter is not just about their game, it is the perfect platform to talk about the game directly to their audience, and there have been multiple occasions even recently where I've been excited that a newsletter from the team has come through, then dismayed to see that the game's progress is either not mentioned at all or briefly mentioned in passing amongst a number of other things. I like the generally casual atmosphere the developers are projecting onto the community but there really needs to be some more formality in talking about the game's progress.The team have apologised for the lack of updates, and still connect with their fanbase through livestreams showing off the game's progress, but there seriously needs to be some public updates to the game posted to Steam to keep any sort of larger fanbase going. Even being allowed to play around with the unstable developer versions through the Steam Beta service would be some sort of signal that the game is still being actively worked on. I would love to see this game come to completion, however at present it seems like this is not going to happen.			"

								I played Pro Wrestling X for 15 seconds: I struck the computer a few times, grappled him, and gave him a suplex that would make Jim Ross's palsey flare up. I then waited patiently for 6 minutes so I could write a review.This game is unplayable at this point, but if you watched the video it isn't meant to be. The developers released it early access to allow die hard fans of the N64 era of wrestling an opportunity to voice their input. The only positive thing I can say at this point is that the character models look fantastic. This game has a long way to go, but I am extremely optomistic that the end product will result in the best wrestling game since N64's WWF No Mercy.To the development team, I just wanna thank each and every one of ya'll, for all you've done to your bodies.... IT'S STILL REAL TO ME, DAMNIT! I mean.... thank you guys. You're awesome. Thank you so much for making the game that needed to be made.			"

Early Access Review
								So far this game is still early in development. But I believe it has a lot of potential. I know that the gamemakers are working hard to add more features. I hope some of the gamemakers are reading this, because I have a few features I would like to see in future updates: (Other gamers have likely requested most of thes already)-Tag Team Matches-Hardcore matches-Ladder Matches-More customization features for wrestlers and arenas-More CAW spots-More songs on the game's soundtrack, and the ability to add your own from iTunes-Springboarding-More moves-A unique and customizable moveset for every wrestler-Customizable controls for controller-Wrestler entrances-Female wrestlers-Clampionship BeltsI am sure most of those features will eventually be added. I have high hopes for this game in the future and I know that the developers do too. I can't wait to see the features that will be added in the future!			"

								This is, in all honesty, a lot of fun, even in early access. I can tell how much effort is being put into this product. As another review stated, getting this on Early Access gets you a promise of good things to come, and I can tell there will be good things when this is finally completed. The only trouble I had was properly mapping the controls to my Logitech Controller, but that wasn't a big deal once I got it down proper. I absolutely adore the feel of when I hit a move, and most of all, this is already looking to be one of the best games on Steam once this is completed. Here's to the developers and their future with this game, cause I can tell it will be a success.			"

Early Access Review
								I recently played the Pro Wrestling X Early Access release, and here’s what I gathered:- The intro screen looks sleek and modern.- Quick loading times- In regards to gameplay, there is only 1 punch animation, one move, and one pin variation- No ability to run, climb the turnbuckle, pick up your opponent, leave the ring, or block- No character selection- No ring entrances- No sound or sound FX- A few bugs and clipping issues that will likely be fixed in future updates- Pressing TAB will give you an alternate camera angleBasically, less to work with than PWX: Uprising, so it’s hard to give it a thorough critiquing. It is difficult to recommend since there is so little to do in this game, especially since this is not the final version. And admittedly, while I understand that it is an Early Access release that's stripped to the bare bones and that they have a small team, after what was promised and displayed on their Kickstarter nearly a year ago (including blocking and spirit meters), I expected more. While I understand why some would recommend that you should try this game out at this stage anyways because A) this game will be updated over time and will get better, B) there aren’t many choices for wrestling games on the PC to begin with, and C) the market is saturated with WWE games and variety is needed, it is woefully below fans and supporters expectations.While it models itself off of the AKI games, there is a possibility that it will be able to do things that the AKI games could not do, and if you are a fan of those games, than you should defiantly give this a chance. However, I would personally recommend that you wait until it is further developed and more ideal before trying the game out.What I would like to know:If you are modeling this off of the AKI Games, then will we have the ability to have matches with rounds, to have MMA style matches? I know this feature is available in VPW2. Will there be a 10 count for matches like Last Man Standing and deathmatches, in addition to TKOs?If you work on an opponent’s limb during the match, will there be limb damage?Will wrestlers get fatigued if they are in long matches?  If so, will there be a “breathing” button if help them recover? It was something I saw in King of Colosseum 2 where wrestler will get tired after a period of time and needs to take breather before continuing with the match, and thought it was an interesting feature.Will there be post match ratings, in regards to how good the match is? It’s another idea I saw in KOC2.Will we be able to do corner moves to someone propped up on the guardrail?Will we be able to do a figure four around the ring post a la Bret Hart?Will there be the option of tag and non tag handicap matches? Will they be single fall or elimination?How many guys can be on screen at a time, 6,8,10? It’s important to know if it will be possible to have Survivor Series style matches, proper Lumberjack matches,  proper battle royales, and even WarGames/Lethal Lockdown type of matches somewhere in the future.What I would like to see:Being able to press slam, overhead suplex, and back body drop opponents over the top rope and to be able to do moves off of the cage. We were able to do this in the Acclaim series of wrestling games, but not in the AKI games. The option to win by pin, submission, escape, and/or first blood in a cage match. Plus the ability to have cage tag matches, and cage triple threat matches and cage four ways as well. Another thing we were able to do in the Acclaim games, but not the AKI games.While I don’t personally think it is vital to have ladder matches, table matches, TLC matches and such at this time, I do think that we should be able at least to climb ladders, set up and stack tables, prop up weapons in the corner, and leap off of chairs onto opponents like Sabu. WWF Raw, the only major wrestling game for PC in the last 15 years, never did these things.I think it is more important that we are able to fight in the crowd than backstage, although it is nice to know that you are working on backstage areas as well. If we fight in the crowd, then we should be able to leap off and throw others off of balconies.  Variation of match types – 1 vs 3 handicap matches, Gauntlet matches (single and tag), multi man tag matches, Survivor Series matches, triangle matches (elimination triple threat), stable matches, and a proper Royal Rumble (2 men start off, and eliminations only by throwing them over the top rope). Hopefully, you will be able to get a few more people working with you so that the game can be done faster. Or give us a timetable to let us know when you expect things to be done.EDIT (June 23): The updates made to the game have vastly improved it. More moves, more taunts (including American Grasshopper’s signature taunt), health meters, music, even mats have been added to the outside of the ring. And as they have a new programmer who is really good at what he does, and we finally have an idea as to what the next scheduled updates will be, it should ease the concerns of those who wonder if the game is progressing.After going from recommended to not recommended, I would say that this game is a recommended purchase, final decision. This game is getting there, and is slowly but surely starting to become the game that everyone has been dreaming about. After the bungled release of WWE 2k15 (no port should have so many problems), this has restored my faith in wrestling games ending up on Steam and on the PC.P.S. Didn’t know you were originally going to use the Fire Pro way of delivering finishers. I like that system. It’s pretty cool, although what you have in the game (No Mercy/AKI style) is nice too.			"

								WARNING: The game is in very, very, very, very, early stages. Don't buy if you expect to have a match.Pro Wrestling X aims to bring back the N64 style wrestling games, and already you can see their influence in the very few animations in the game.Currently the game only has one grapple move, one strike, one pin, and hundreds of bugs!I recommend this project, as it is a much needed addition to not only PC gaming, but gaming in general.WWE games are pretty average. I gave up on them with Smackdown Vs Raw, and only occasionally played Day of Reckoning 2 on Gamecube, as it was better, but still bug ridden.Early access is more of an investment than anything else. Sometimes you can get a fantastic game cheap, and sometimes you get a game that never gets finished.You could do a lot worse with £6.99, though.As for its current state: Better than Wrestlemania 18. 2/10 :P			"

Early Access Review
								The video from the developer is very honest, it shows exactly what this currently has and it is made clear this is a work in progress. If he sticks to his word and takes the feedback on board from the wrestling fans who are showing faith in his vision this can be a brilliant game, but it isn't yet so don't go buying this with expectations of it being 2k15, however It has a good foundation to build on. I like the indie feel to the game and think it should continue down that road, keep it simple like most of the indie companies around the world.Things I'd like to see would be the wrestlers getting back up a little quicker, right now they get up like pensioners trying to get out of a chair rather than athletes in a ring. Obviously like everyone else I'd like more of the basics introduced like being able to kick and run the ropes etc.Long Term I'd like to see:Customisable arenas/ringsAbility to create wrestlersVariety of different matchesI have seen some comments about commentary being added but that wouldn't bother me, it has always annoyed me in wrestling games because they say the same generic phrases over and over again, it gets a bit annoying.

								So, where do I start?I bought this game about a year ago, I think.I was watching development for about 4 years back when it PWX: Uprising.It looked interesting, but somewhat broken in the Uprising alpha.I decided to hold off and not buy it.Lo and behold, the game was rebooted, but there was only about 3 moves in the rebooted prealpha.So, it stayed that way for about a year, and... it got updated?!?Development suddenly sped up, patches were rolling out roughly every month, tightening the core gameplay.But, it is still unfinished.So, basically, wait until it his 1.0 final version before you buy it, but it is fun now, so if you want to support the developer, buy it now.Final Verdict: 7/10: It's getting there			"

								Really enjoying the No Mercy style. The foundation is being built quite nicely! Looking forward to seeing the progress. Another amazing thing is these guys involved in making this game are asking for our feedback as wrestling gamers! Ever wanted the chance to give your feedback/comments on a wrestling game and wait for it... ""actually"" get heard about it and possibly have your feedback/comments addressed and where something could be done about it? This is the game for it. Not to mention the future improvements/additions/updates! Right now I think this game is very well worth the $9.99 because of the incredible potential it possess. A great investment IMO. "

 First of all,this game just $9.99I am a pro wrestling fan,and I am PC gamer.I didn't have console,so I really miss a wrestling game.I am waiting a new release game on Steam,and then I saw this game.So I didn't need to think twice,I buy this game.I don't care about unplayable at this moment,but I just want to support the developer to make this game will be better and better.GameplayAs usual,in Early Access game you will get a lot of bug.I send a bug report to Pro Wrestling X team,I hope they read my report.3 moveset that I learned : Punch,Grapple,and Suplex.Oh I play this game with keyboard,so I am trying hard to know the controls. My expectation to this game-I can create my own brand(create a promo and feud,plot twist for every promo)-More movesets-A good lighting and ringset-More characters-More match varieties(hardcore match,cage match,etc)-A good crowd interaction(boo and cheer when promo and match) Conclusion If you are pro wrestling fan,YOU MUST BUY THIS GAMEGood luck to Wrestling Gamers United for creating this game.I hope more pro wrestling fan buy this game and give you a better feedback.

								This game has potential even though it still lacks many things. The basic CAW system is a good start together with the 2 characters that look realistic and have nice and beautiful models. Once more updates, bug fixes, characters and match types are in the game, this game will definitely be worth buying.*EDIT*There are updates coming almost every month with bug fixes and new things/moves. It is defenitely improving and soon enough, PWX will be the next No Mercy (or any wrestling game you wanted in life!).*EDIT* 23/4/160.94 Really changed the face of PWX.

								 I’ve been waiting for the early access for a while now, as i missed the kick-starter. This game is a must for any wrestling game fans. Especially the ones who are disenfranchised with the current WWE titles.  Pro wrestling x harkens back to the AKI wrestling games on the N64. If you ever played  the WCW vs NWO title’s then this game is for you.  Be warned though. this game is far from finished and in its current form its little more than a demo. Hopefully WishboneX will pull this one off and make good on their promises.  That wrestling simulation itch I’ve had since the days of WWF No mercy will finally get scratched.  "

								""When I made you, I named you 'X'. X is a variable; it means you have limitless potential. The capacity to become ANYTHING"" --Dr. Thomas Light, when he addresses Mega Man X.Greetings! *Takes a Bow*This is my first Review on Steam, so I'm pretty stoked!First off: a nod to the Development Team of Pro Wrestling X, and to you, Dave Wishnowki, the Producer, GREAT GAME, already shows promise, I can't to see how Pro Wres X shapes up!! I love how you reference Fire Pro, btw (which stole MONTHS from my life lol)Decided to take the plunge, and went for early Access, and it already looks great!  First time a Wrestling Game is on the PC, and I'm already impressed, heck, excited!For Starters:The Main Menu greets me with a bad @$$ Rock Song, and a small, albeit user friendly Options and Keyboard / Controller Ready Interface, my Logitech PC Controller already feels at home in Pro Wrestling X (w/out the need for JoytoKey?? Color me impressed!) Whoever made this game Controller friendly; great job!The Menu is all here: Single Play, Options, Edit, Credits, etc.  Each Menu item is simple, and covers the Basics, like a good Fighting / Wrestling Game should, and I got everything in my Options tweaked and Saved in a jiffy.  However, I would like to see Mouse Support; a PC Wrestler Game w a Mouse is the stuff of dreams. Maybe even Touch Screen Interface on future PC Platforms....The Edit Mode already shows promise:  I made a Ring and a Fighter, with the help of the present interface, very user friendly, and with a healthy list of Edit Options. It reminded me of older Wrestler Games from ye Old School; simple, but fun to make. The CAW mode is a huge seller for me, in any Wrestler, and this one does it nicely. The textures and details really look convincing. The Lucha Libre styled Mask and matching pads are a very classy touch, the one that caught my eye invoked an almost Draconic feel. I dig it.Of course, I wouldn't a Female Wrestler Option. A Sable and/or Chyna -esque wrestling hottie in HD, with the return to ""the N64 / No Mercy Era""?? Doing a Bronco Buster in the Corner??  mmmm giggidy!!And an Editable Moves List. (Sorry, had to say it!)Anyway. I can't wait to see how the Edit Mode Evolves!  Gameplay Wise: It's got the basic nuts and bolts down; the Moves work like they should: the Strikes hit accurately, The Grabs do do their job, the Guard works, like No Mercy... etc.  The AI Edit is a welcome feature, and the AI Bot works well enough.  I started with Inactive, to get the Game Play down pat, then bump it up as we got things under way.Between the DDT and Tower Suplex, that alone made me grin.  And that Dragon Sleeper has never looked cooler. (One of my old stand byes. now we just need a Dragon Suplex!!)Speaking of which, I'm hoping to see some Back Grapples. Seeing a Dragon Suplex, or Tossing German Suplex or a Rough Toss, in this this games edgy appearance, would be a treat.I noticed the ""Left Bumper"" (left, front Shoulder Button, or  ""L1"" in PlayStation speak)does a Back Step, with the hands raised. I wonder; Reversals? (I sure hope so!)The Run... done with the Y Button on my Controller, well... it's archaic. Hate to say it. In current Wrestling Games, you have a ""Free Run"", hold a Shoulder Button, and Run Freely.Try that, see if it works. So far, in Game Play, the game runs pretty smooth. The pacing is a little sluggish, I would like to see more variation in individual Fighter Speeds; how fast / slow they move, how fast they get up, etc. Personally, I wouldn't mind a feature were your Fighter quickly clambers to his / her feet, or Kips Up, or even an Ukemi: a quick Roll off the Ground, when you are knocked down.  Things like this make a game flow quickly and smoothly.I notice, when I interact with my opponent; several opportunities to attack in unique ways:while the AI was in several different and prone positions; such as bent over, sitting up, getting up etc, I'm thinking: different Holds, Grapples, Strikes, etc; in all the enemies varying postures.  More ways to mess with the opposition in his/hers many vulnerable states, would really spice the Moves List Up. Also, ways to Break and Cancel your own Holds / Grabs, and possibly flow into another move, or simply Release the Opponent, to set up a ""big surprise"", would be neat.Other then that; between the Basics: Strikes, Grabs, Lifting the Opponent off the Mat, and getting yourself up, fairly quick... it's all there.I hope we can exit the ring soon. The Outside Ring Count Down, before a DQ, should be Optional.Also, gotta have Back Stage Areas. Like No Mercy. I miss those. On a Side Note: 1. The In Match Song. KEEP THAT. It's a kick @$$ song.  In Match Music is good Music, PLEASE, NO BORING COMMENTARY.2.  A variety of Music and Songs, would be awesome. Personally, I'm thinking: 8 and 16 Bit Era Music, Rock and Metal, or Techno and Rave.  On that note, if you do decide on Commentary in Ring:  A. Keep it witty. Like SVR 2006 witty. It made laugh at times.B. Use your In House Voice talent, from your Development Team, to run Commentary:make Fictional Characters of yourselves, you inject yourself into your own work this way, (and save money on Actors lol) you get to goof off in Development, and when your Testerslisten to In Match Commentary; you can say: ""Yup, that's me!"" Dave Wishnowski; In Game Host, Narrator, Announcer, etc... heck, screen yourself, and  your Team,  in the Announcer Chairs, Audience, Back Stack Interviews...! OWN IT, DUDE.. That would we cool.   C. Make Commentary, In Match Music / Songs, heck, even running Dev. Team talks, Options, that can Toggled In the Options Menu, under Music Options.This way, we have the Option of hearing Songs, Music, Narrative, Ect,  in the Games Matches. I can picture:  Directors Cut Commentary, on the evolution of Pro Wrestling X, in a Match.Or random goofing off on the mic. Just a thought. But keep it all Optional. Different strokes, right? This way, your more involved in the game's progress. My Favorite thing, thus far, is the way the game itself looks:  The Ring Itself. In a Shadowy Darkness. No Crowd. No Ref. No Announcer. The soft focus glow, complimented by the colors, highlights, the lighting and shadows.... duuuuude, keep that. Or at least, make it an Option. I already dig the aesthetics of the  ""Current Look"". I hope that look sticks around, very dramatic... like a Play Wright, or an Opera Scene.  If you use a crowd, make them look Shadowy, like a dramatic play. An Idea:  make a scene like a Japanese Dojo, keep the lighting low, lit by candles, and have the Crowd on Traditional Mats, like an Asian Teahouse, with their faces barely showing in the candle light and shadows.  Another Idea:  A nod to the Undertaker, and his Acolytes, keep the Ring dark, &lit with Torches.Ideas like this, make a game memorable.  (Remember WCW Thunder, PS1? It had crazy Stages!) But so far, the Game Play is off to good start, man!! Keep it upOverall, I'm excited. I can't wait to see where Pro Wrestling X goes, and see where the Crazy Train ends up next!!The 2nd Coming of No Mercy is upon us. I can feel it.But remember:  Just like a Dragon's Claw never stops growing, never stop improving. Do not be satisfied with limits; Evolve, Grow, Adapt. The Journey to true Greatness, never ends. It continues, like a River's Flow, steady and sure.			"

								This game is going no where I helped the kickstarter but I should have known it was too good to be true. I tried it as soon as it went early access, and it was basicully not a game at all.And I just tried it again today, and it has grown a little bit, but it took over a year to grow just a little bit. If I could get my money back I would because this is just sad. On top of all that the game is very stiff, and slow.I will check in from time to time on the game and if it ever gets good I will change my review.			"

								While very basic at the moment, Pro Wrestling X currently presents a strong working backbone to what will very likely be a great wrestling game.  It very much plays like a demo of an N64 wrestling game, especially if you set up your controller correctly.  If you have a 'difficult' controller like myself (damn you, Saitek!), I highly recommend Joy2Key.  It works perfectly.Graphics are very nice, and while the game doesn't have the content in place yet, the game shows a lot of promise and is currently very fun to play around with.  I can't wait to see what's in store in the future!			"

								This is a good game but needs a few things 1 a practice mode to learn moves and to work with created caracters and 2 a single player mode championship belt or something like that. I am aware the game is unfinshed so i will rceommend it as the game play seems good enough  and the graphics is good the camera can be a bit wild for the cage match and the music needs a few more tunes but overall a good game			"

								1. Appreicate you guys taking on the challenge for making this game2. I believe the gameplay speed should be a quicker like the Def jam Vendetta series3. The submission limb system should be borrow as from Def jam Vendetta4. Should try to add a ref and an female model wrestler or manager.5.

								Played WWE 2k15 for like 20 minutes and uninstalled. With Pro Wrestling X I continuously look forward to their development and continued additions to the game. I think the core engine is there as far as the move and feel within the ring, taking you back to the glory days of Nintendo 64 wrestling games. As they expand the movesets and add more to the game this will be the standard bearer for wrestling video game fans.			"

								Since it's an early access game it is very basic. So basic it plays like those old fighter demos from back in the day where you could only choose from one of the two characters and play on one stage. However right now as of it's most current build you can edit a third wrestler and make him your own with a very basic editing system that they currently put into the game. Also the game handles nicely on a Nvidia GT610 card with 4GB of memory in ""1280x720 full screen resolution"" with ""fantastic graphics mode"" chosen. Anyways if you liked the N64 No Mercy style of game play this is what they are working towards and I don't think you'll be disappointed. It's a work in progress but it's worth the $9.99 if you want to try it out in it's early access form.  (Review on Build 0.778)			"

I only reccomend you buy this game if you're willing to help this game flourish bigger and better.  Mark the words of Dentenshi Reignhart!

								I've been following this game through thick and thin, so I did throw myself knowing it wasn't ready as of yet.But this is pretty much -exactly- what the Devs said they'd put out at the start so they could see just what people thought, there's no climing turnbuckles, only strikes a brianbuster and a slightly floaty looking pin.Other than that, buy this in it's current state onl if you seek to help improve this game over iterations.If you're a wrestling fan, you'll likley enjoy what wil lcome, byut we're in the -very- early stages here so, I urge ya'll to maybe wait, Unless you -really- enjoy just Brianbustering a guy.  If I -can- review this game once it's in a more complete state: I will.EDIT- : Later on more patches, more animations and the game is starting to resemble somethigng much closer to what it wants to be, Sure it's not perfect but you can feel the passion behind every button press, now more features and moves are being added along with the limited ability to custom create  the ball is well and truly rolling.Keep up the good work guys!

I recommend PWX because of what it is becoming, what has been promised, the devs are huge N64 wrestling fans, and because of all of those things, its a steal at its current price.Here's to more content, more patches, and finally getting a wrestling game like the beloved N64 wrestling games, (but better!?)

								This game has definitely came a long way since it first hit Steam Greenlight. The controls are really straightforward and have a great feel to them, throws are quick but not lightning unseeable fast, the animations all look pretty great even being work in progress, everything is what a wrestling game should be. Right now of course there are limited throws, wrestlers, rings, so on and so forth, but the foundation is SOLID and all this game needs is some time. The build I'm playing as of September 8th has one strike and like 5 throws and I'm already having fun with it, the game is just satisfying to play.			"

								I paid for the potential. It's there, but it's clunky. They posted a update, so it runs much better. . It needs a lot of work. Characters all look the same. Grappling isn't as responsive as it could be. The brief bits of music I heard, I liked. The graphics are decent, but need cleaning up. I think calling the game version .99 is being generous. It needs a lot more work to feel finished. I can't recommend it at this time. It's fun enough, but the grappling can be clunky, and it feels like there isn't much content here. Character customization is almost non-existant (around 2 options for most things, and then color). There are features that are in the options, but not selectable. There is a decent variety of moves. It takes a bit to figure out which buttons to use, and there are no button options in game. Pick it up while on sale if anything.			"

								Updated 10 months later.I have being following this game since I found it in the greenlight. I have read it has been too much years in the making. Now it seems a near beta game, but I feel like I would become old before it will be completely finished, but I will enjoy the ride.After big updates the game change near everything, the menu seems more friendly and the game is more playable but it needs some work yet.A great update is the edit options for wrestlers and rings.The wrestler edit menu is quite basic, the main problem is it have to few options (most of them have 3 different options and there are 8 colours), I hope the add more items soon because is hard to make different wrestler when you have to reuse some options because you have 3 options.The ring edit menu is great, but I had the problem that you choose the options with the left stick but it is used to rotate the ring too and you must try to get back to prior position with the right stick to watch what are you doing. You can play a match 1 vs 1 choosing from the wrestlers and rings you have saved. You can choose the IA difficulty and the game works smooth, sometimes it seems slow, but I choose the best graphics option, probably other options are faster (need to try).I missed too much the key display in options easy accessible from the match menu. I don't know how to activate the ""finisher"" when the special displays in the hub.I didn't find any use to run, probably there are no running moves yet.I didn't messed up with the camera because the during game it seems fine, I only get a little annoying with the music, because I'm not used to have music during a match instead the ambient and FX, and commentary... The problem I see is that when the match get longer the music repeat more times and take you out of the feeling it gives you at the begining.I can't recomend to anyone looking for a finished game, although I encourage you if you are a wrestling or indie fan and want to back it up, it's just at the begining but it looks good and promising.It is being hard to me to update because I have less time and willpower to enjoy the beta-tester work now that WWE 2k15 is in steam. I will try to update the review when changes are more noticeable and I will try to test deeply the actual state.			"

								I can't say I've been following Pro Wrestling X since it's inception, but I have lost count on how many years I've been reading the news letters and crossing my fingers that PWX might actually come to fruition. I first read about it in an article in a game magazine (Game Informer I think) in the early 2000's. I have desired to support the project monitarily since around 2005 but I just haven't been able to muster the extra funds. I'm happy I can finally contribute to the early access, even if the game never developes past what it has become, I have to give Dave and the crew respect for not giving up on their dream and I wish them all the best success. I respect the perseverance and heart of this project.I am giving this game a thumbs up, not because I enjoyed playing the current build, but because I was finally able to physically interact with a project that for over a decade has been only screen shots and commentary. I do have some criticisms of the build but I will find a different outlet for those as I am a hardcore wrestling game fan and I suspect the average gamer might not understand my reasons.It is encouraging to see the makings of a creation suite at this early stage. The addition of the ability to take snapshots with a free camera, adjust and customize rings, and create a wrestler will allow us to see these features grow along with the core mechanics of the game and that excites me. So, I'll save my criticisms for a different time and place. Thank you Dave for sticking with your vision through the many years, your dream is also the dream of many others. Be encouraged that after all these years we still have not seen a valid successor to WWF No Mercy, if it is to be it is up to you!			"

								Hello there wrestling fans if you reading the reviews trying to find out what good about this game or bad then i hope this is for you. So why should you play this game? well to me the game is now back in moving to there games goals and very quickly too so every time you play you may get something new happen to the gameplay. The gameplay at the moments is getting better and i think for the long time we found our ecw of wrestlings games there going aganest the norm of 2k wwegames. In today gaming world FPS, Fighting, Wrestling and more are going easy old mortal kombat games it was hard to hit that finish move and first person games you use to be able to go any where now it go to a to b, wrestling games now follow going hit one button and have a cutscene of the ring breaking well now we got this game trying to bring that hardcore gaming back to wrestling free wrestling style. the furture i see in this game are great i think we could see a corner move that only happens in 3 way match the powerbomb suplex combro that will not need a cutscene it just happen on the move.here is the list of good things i like about pwx. There listling to there fans. You get that old wrestling game feeling . wrestling moves look real . The ring is good to look..the gameplay is getting better by the months.now to the things i want to see in the game. The leather stap match. bruse body parts say you fight for a hour i want to see them beat up. face paint that could come off when beat up. Ladder match. Have ring Damage but have it happen on a rare day like a ring rope breaks and wrestler can't use those rope moves.. a lumber jack macth . diffdient days themes like a sports game you play on christmas day well for the it snow or the screen is wrap up for the season but for your game it could be the crowd wear warm cloths or if it holloween you could have a cage match and have spooky stuff on the cage.. a big roster of guys . the flame spot yes it a bad spot in wwe or wcw days but i never seen it in a wrestling game you blow flames on you pray   . the triple powerbomb combo someone must try it first.. last thing that i like to see is a 10 man tag.thank you for the fun pro wrestling x will bring wrestling games back to gamers.

Early Access Review
								First of all, I would like to say that I have been following this project for a long time, its ups and downs and have read both negative and positive and pushed all that to one side as I decided to try it. I've waited to see a little more content before taking the plunge and buying it but thought 'what the hell' maybe putting a little capital into it may just get it moving quicker. I have always been a wrestling fan and definitely a wrestling gamer fan but have a huge love for Three games in particular, WCW World Tour on the PS1, Fire Pro Wrestling 2 on the Gameboy Advance and WWF No Mercy on the N64 so a game that even vaguely resembles any of these would be ideal… So this is what I have found so far and what I'd like to see coming soon just to add a bit more longevity.Firstly, this game is super smooth, it plays like a dream even on highest graphical settings, wrestlers movements are really smooth and even though at this stage the moves are limited they all look nice, I’ve certainly not had any of the Smackdown of old issues with collisions problems with dropkicks. The rope running is nice and again I have had no issues from the few games I have played thus far. All and all it looks and feels good thus far.The game itself is very, very early stages and it shows in the other aspects of the game, lack of moves, only 3 characters and nothing really to do in create a wrestler bar mix and match the costumes from the two named workers… All of this is already noted in the previous reviews and the description so I wasn’t shocked at all by this, I was however disappointed there was no generic tights, trunks and masks of just plain colours so even in its raw form you could at least cobble together a motley roster just if nothing else to stave off the repetitive nature of the game at its current stage.All in all, I would say it needs a few more little things adding before it is worth the amount it is up for however if you wanna support the game and see it grow into something remarkable then click buy even if you don’t intend to play it for a few updates because it really does show so much potential even with the small amount already there.So in short for me to make it worth it as is it needs:•	A few generic Create a player bits just to give you something to get your teeth into•	One more character at least•	A single weapon like a chair to see an example of weapon collision detection.All in all, though If you wanna support an independent wrestling game with promise click buy.

Early Access Review
								TL:DR translation - Coming along. (Original Review Below for reference)When I first played this and declined to give it an overall recommendation for purchasing it, it was, in fact, extremely early in development as far as steam goes. Anything and everything the community said about the developer, honestly, loomed in the back of my mind like a heel turn at a PPV when you know good and well the star heel of the federation is taking a break being hurt (aka - Shooting a movie) and someone has to pick up the torch.After loading it up, however, I was greeted to a new menu. Progress. I liked it. I played around with the edit button and this part of the area. It is easy to see the foundation work in place, but the developer is wisely persuing gameplay advances. So let me get to that.A quick selection started the up and coming Default... yeah.. I forgot to rename him before I saved... against Grasshopper. After seeing each character given a serviceable in ring introduction, the contest was started. Default was determined... he walked up to Grasshopper and punched.Grasshopper blocked it?What... when... okay.. This is new.. So I backed up to collect my thoughts coincidentally right as Grasshopper attempted a drop kick. Thankfully I was back far enough. A few grapple moves instead and some playing around with button combinations... as if I expected to shoot a fireball out of my hands.. And bam. Default had his first win, but it wasn't just his.Fans of the old schoo N64 wrestling games where it was all about fun have won, too. Pro Wrestling X is alive and definately on track.Don't get me wrong. This is STILL early access. And the developer clearly keeps that thought forefront in all his materials. It is just now, there is a lot of improvement and the game has earned a definite thumbs up from me. If you want finished product, have fun with big fed game. Just don't be shocked if this old school Gym and folding chair independent game gives them all they want and more.At this point, that's very much in the hands of the developer.ORIGINAL REVIEWYes, I'm in on it and a believer. At the current price, most of you would be very much off put to purchase this at this time. My recommendation to you all is to follow this project and watch implementations as they arrive. At this point in time, the developer is VERY CLEAR that there isn't much to do here. Punch, Grapple, slam and pin. That's all you get. Once they are in place and at a point you wish to jump in, do so. ' Nuff said. So, for most of you, honestly at this point it is a no.This, however, is very deceptive of my personal feelings about where this can go and the opportunity for those of you that want a No Mercy style game on the PC. Hop on, buckle up and take notes. The opportunity is here to get involved with the development (as much as the developers would listen, that is) So, that in mind, here is my wish list. (NOTE: WISH LIST MEANS NOT IN GAME)-More... (Directly from Captain Obvious here.. More moves, More Wrestlers, More Environments.. I think the cheesy crowd thing can be averted.. It will only be a point of nit picking down the line unless it is done shaded or almost greyed out.)-MP3(/video?) integration. Ever look through the song list and think... damn.. I want my wrestler to come out to this one song but it isn't here... Well.. it will be your own library that you pick from. The developer isn't supplying it.. so it isn't his concern about copyright infringements.. just yours if you share the match on youtube.-Commentary (very touchy situation here.. good luck, devs) Watch a match with the sound off.. any match on TV.. isn't as exciting is it? Well. The game in current state won't seem as exciting without the commentators giving you the vocal thumbs up or down.-Running. Could also be used as a modifier... Run + strike = lariat Run + Rope + Strike = Rebound crossbody eh.. throw it under more.That all being said, it is an excellent start.I'm gonna shut my pie hole now as the devs are probably shaking their heads saying (already on most of this)			"

Early Access Review
								Alright. I know what you're thinking. ""32 minutes and you're already writing a review for it?"" Well...yeah! I literally tried out almost everything and I already have my opinions. You see, I am a huge fan of the THQ/AKI games for the N64. When I found out that this game had been touted by the developers as ""The next No Mercy"", I was intrigued. I was a little skeptical though. I thought the game would be a broken mess that wasn't ready for their 1.0 update. Well, thankfully, I was proven wrong! The game actually plays quite well. It has the same feel as the AKI games, which is really what I was looking forward to.Unfortunately, there are some problems I have with the game. The main issue I have is the lack of modes in the game.  I mean you can do matches with up to four wrestlers, but there's little variety and you can't change the rules. The Edit Mode is pretty lackluster too. Sure it's still in the early stages, but I really want to create an appearance, I wouldn't be able to give my wrestler its own moves, which I will get to, but it would still be nice. The other issue I have, and they said they would fix this in the future, is that all the wrestlers have the same moves. I get this is in Early Access, but really? The same moves? Ah well. I guess I will just pick the coolest looking character, Fake Sting. The last issue I have is the camera angle. I feel like it's too low and I can't really see what I am doing or where my moves are gonna make my opponent land.Overall, for a wrestling game, it's pretty damn good! The controls are geat and feel just like the old days. It's just a shame they are charging 10 bucks for a game this limited. I mean, this isn't No Mercy yet. It's more like WCW vs. nWo World Tour (except without any multiplayer whatsoever). But still, if you have any sort of interest in this game, pay the 10 bucks now because they're going to raise the price later!			"

								You really can't do anything with this game, and it's unlikely you ever will now that WWE 2K15 is slated for release later in a few days.  Good premise, but looks like it will be abandoned.***Update 6/22/15***It's alive!  The camera isn't quite right but some seven months after they started you can now simulate a very basic fight versus an AI wrestler.  Great music (one song), graphics look good, and it will be interesting to see how often they cycle updates.  I may very well have to change my opinion!***Update 9/5/16***Updates up to this point are pretty awesome. There are a handful of wrestler choices now, more than a half-dozen, and during the game the AI will run interference if you are in trouble (a wrestler comes from back stage to help you). A wrestler came out of nowhere and speared and jackhammered my opponent, haha. For that, I give a thumbs up, finally. That is a great WCW/NWO World Tour/Revenge kind of vibe. There are also triple threat and 4x4 in progress, it looks like, but now CAW yet.Again, the one song is really good. Who performs that song?!All in all, to be honest, this game still needs a lot of work before it is a contender, but the content has potential. Some kind of progressive mode and a CAW would be the minimum before final release.			"

								By reading previous reviews, I think a lot of the users missed the fact that this is an early access game. WE help shape the future of this game by providing feedback for the developers. It's not in a finished state and it should not be treated as if it is a finished product.If you're a fan of the old school wrestling games from the Nintendo 64 era, Pro Wrestling X just might be up your alley! In early access the game is limited to three game modes, basic wrestler editor and a ring editor. There are three playable characters with the option to create up to nine of your own. Move sets are limited but will be expanding with each update. The progress that has been made on this game so far is impressive when you keep in mind the size of the development team.Pro Wrestling X is a game that has so much potential. Although the game is limited in its current state and needs a bit more polish, the future for Pro Wrestling X is looking bright. If you're looking to support a game that looks to bring a modernized wrestling experience inspired by the N64 games, look no further then Pro Wrestling X! "

								Pro Wrestling XIt is turning into a great game, the developers care about this game (that I can see) and its great. They do live streams all the time and will answer like all your questions which is awesome. Pro Wrestling X has a community and its great. Sometimes I can see a couple fights in the forums but apart from that its great. Its shaping into a great game and with the new update including the steel cage match it is looking great.The only bad thing I could say is that maybe the developers could go on the forums a bit more but in there weekly newsletter (yea they have one of those) they have talked about that.

								I definitely recommend this game. May not be finished quite yet, but definitely shows a lot of potential. If you guys would watch their broadcasts on twitch.tv, you would be able to see all of their progress live there. Overall, definitely looks like its shaping up to be a very good game.			"
