Early Access Review
								Respect to the dev for going it alone and giving making something a go. But I can't in good concience recommend purchasing this product. Not for $20, not for the $10 I got it on sale for... Maybe at $2 I'd consider it passable.In 45 minutes I'd played through all the content with a friend and we were both exceedingly underwhelmed. The game has remarkably low production values. The low quality assets are used poorly. The interface is awkward. Gameplay is buggy and some features flat out don't work.Of the 18 holes I was impressed by the creativity of 3 or 4 of them, but that's hardly a glowing recomendation for a minigolf videogame. It's not so much polish that the game lack as it is professionalism. People complaining it's just a bunch of unity assets amateurly hacked together are not just being mean. Many of the course decorations are small art assets that have been absurdly upscaled resulting is stretched textures and super obvious low poly models. The fact the tutorial starts with the developer introducing themself as a voice over and then passively agressively insulting you when the club bugs out and you don't hit the ball correctly on your first try really sets the tone for the level of quality you can expect going forward from that point.Multiplayer is more like simultaneous single player. You can't see each others balls, theres no score comparison... Heck, you don't even get a total of your own score and have to work out for yourself if you are under par. Teleport is janky and the ability to teleport to your ball is buried in a menu rather then bound to the controls. The game is in Early access at time of review and even free I'm not sure it's really worth my time. Like I said the developer has some creative potential and well done to him for actually getting a product up on his own rather then just dreaming about it. But he might want to rethink his approach if he wants his product to be taken seriously.As it stands anyone looking for a VR minigolf experience I highly recommend Cloudlands Minigolf. For the same price it is leagues ahead in every way.			"

								Great VR experience to try with friends.  I love the fact that you are free to go anywhere you want as opposed to just where your ball is.			"

								One of my first purchases.  It's basic, the controls are a bit irritating.  I wouldn't bother I'm sorry to say			"

								It says it's supported for the Oculus Rift and has ""Tracked Motion Controllers"", however, I can't seem to play the game at all with my Oculus Touch.			"

								This is probably one of the best games I've experienced in VR thus far, and is so much fun to pass and play with someone else. The physics feel spot-on and the courses are charming and so much fun.  Big props!			"

								Played the Station course and realized I suck at minigolf VR more than I do in real life and I had no idea that was possible! Can't wait to fire it up again to play multiplayer.			"

								I only played single player mode. It's not so attractive for me.The game graphic could be better,but now it just like a students topics.Maybe we can play this game when it had a higher degree of completion.			"

								Developer seems to have abandoned this game.It's not worth anything close to $20 in it's current state.Some simple iteration on this title would have gone a long way.Don't buy, it's abandonware.			"

								This is a competent golf game and runs very well on my system. The ball physics are pretty good and menus are intuitive, Its always a popular game when I have groups round as it has local multiplayer. It is clearly still in development but the content that is available is high quality. I am really looking forward to seeing what this game becomes.The game gets extra points for making one of my friend rip some of his nail off when trying to throw his club into space (which is really fun)			"
