+ Visually appealing with 4 unique environments with great use of lighting.+ Gameplay is solid. It is classic Chess with nice simple controls + Great for learning how to play Chess or improving your knowledge / skill. + A few other game modes such as chaos-mode and chess puzzles- There is no animation when moving pieces, so they instantly move across the board. This makes it a bit hard to see what the computer's last move was as it happens in an instant.~ I would have liked to have seen more environments			"

												Cute game with pretty graphics, but limited camera angles and limited difficulties make this not worth the money.   I found the that it does not live up to the hype, all flash, no substance.			"

												I play a lot of chess, there's something nice about the simplicity of 3D chess. The background noise has a pleasant calming effect that seems to boost your concentration, & the pieces & the backgrounds are easy on the eyes. I like that we are allowed to contribute our own puzzles, & the developers are quite friendly & seem genuinely interested in everyone's feedback. I own Fritz for fun, and I can't stand the headache it gives me from the myriad of meaningless features. 3D chess is basic & beautiful & it gets the job done.			"

Product received for free
												I received this product for free for reviewing purposes. This has in no way altered or affected my review.TL;DR I wish there was an ""okay"" button, because that's what 3D Chess is. Just okay. It doesn't stand out or offer much in comparison to other chess games.As said, the visuals are great, but there's not much variety with only 4 environments. Each environment has no music, only a sound effect which loops (Volcano-bubbling lava, Ancient Rome?- fire crackling, and Graveyard-typical spooky sounds). I was expecting the game to have some great music, hence the trailer, but there's no music at all in the game. The sound effects are stock and get so repetitive that I end up just muting it. Gameplay is just like classic chess, and works well. You can play against the computer or another player on the same screen. Computer has 3 difficulties-easy, normal, and hard. There are also 2 other game modes- puzzles, which you have a limited amount of moves to complete 1 of 3 objectives (checking opponent's kind, avoiding check, and checkmating opponent's king), and chaos mode, where the computer plays randomly. Chaos mode is good for beginners to practice chess without repercussions.What really irks me though is no online compatibilty. You can't play against another person, unless they're in the same room, but in that case, you may as well just play with an actual chess set. Point being, there are other chess games on Steam that have more features and online gameplay. Only get this if you want to practice or play against the computer.			"

												Overall -- very good but still a great deal of work is necessary (really a lot). The application freezes pretty often so that's a problem numero uno. Not sure if it's the video card I have but fairly certain I am not the only one and it's a great turn off. Next on the list is fixing some of the arenas as far as lighting conditions (it's difficult to tell which piece is which when all you see are shadows). After that you should enable user to observe the board from an almost arbitrary angle. It can be a challenge as you would have to render the sky etc but even without it, a greater freedom of rotation is necessary, at least so that a player can get to see the board from the top vantage point in 3d mode (you have 2d mode but then the pieces lose 3d rendering which defeats the purpose). For your 2d, make sure to diversify the set of pieces you make available (the ones you have in 2d, which is really only one, are fine but there should be more with emphasis on 3d-ishness and appropriate light/shadow rendering). Increase the set of difficulty modes available (not good enough to just have 3 modes). Preferably to have the modes with ELO designations (i.e. I am playing a 2300 ELO computer opponent says a lot more than 'hard'). Lastly (or in parallel with all of the above), let's keep adding those excellent arenas which is really what this game is all about -- let's focus on boards and pieces with lots of reflection (marble-glass themes etc), lighting effects (fire is very good) -- this would make this game unique in the marketplace.

												Simplistic chess game to test your skill, it provides a beautiful look, and a few environments to change around, though it's missing animations when you or the computer moves a piece, I would recommend the game, it's a great challenge, and a great game to practice.			"
