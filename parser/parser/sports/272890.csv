												Vertiginous Golf is a dystopian steam-punk mini-golf game developed by Kinelco and Lone Elk Creative. Vertiginous Golf (I will refer to it as VG for the rest of my review) is set in the skies above Scudburough in a floating city called New Lun-Donne. Those who live in Scudburough, such as your fine self, can visit Verti-Sphere shops where you can get a temporary fix of verti-golf in the clouds high above.+Nice graphics+Cool dystopian steam-punk world design+54 holes included with the game, each hole is very well designed and there's a good variation of difficulty across all courses+An integrated course editor so you can make your own courses+A few different course types+You can take control of a robotic bird to scout out the track and look for the best way forward+A cool 'free stroke' mechanic which involves you getting the ball in a certain whole to get that stroke free and move you to a different part of the course+Cool rewind function, it's not unlimited which leaves the game a good level of challenge, rewind fuel can be restored by taking shots+Simple controls (I played with a 360 controller)+Good soundeffects and nice soundtrack+Singleplayer and Multiplayer both local and online+/-No predicted path for the ball, personally I would have liked to have seen it be at least an option +/-There aren't many railings on the courses so you're gonna lose your ball over the side often-Awful voice acting, it's all very bland and uninteresting -Uninteresting story which isn't helped by the afore mentioned voice acting-Only two clubs to choose from-The ball feels a bit too bouncy for my liking which makes it even easier for balls to go over the edgeVerdict:7.5A fun dystopian steam-punk mini-golf game with nice graphics, cool world design, loads of courses, an integrated course editor and some cool mechanics. If you like mini-golf games, chances are you're gonna like this.***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***El K.			"

Early Access Review
The GoodVertignious Golf is a gorgeous game, both conceptually and stylistically.  The game controls aren't difficult to grasp, the music and sounds are well designed, and the interface is nice and clean, not interfering with the graphics -- did I mention they were gorgeous?  Oh, yes, I did.The hummingbird and rewind features are welcome additions to the basic gameplay of minigolf.  In fact, given the complexity of some of the holes, they're requirements.  The availability of a wedge in addition to a putter is welcome, adding a level of strategy absent in other minigolf games.The game is also eminently playable -- on the more advanced courses, there are several ways to play each hole, so there's little repetition even with the limited number of courses.  If it has a boredom factor, I haven't reached it yet.The BadWhile I have not identified the game's boredom factor, it does have a frustration factor, and it was found quite quickly.There are difficult holes.  There are even diabolical holes -- the par 3 8th at OSU Scarlet, when the pin is set in that card-table sized tongue of green sticking out into the pond, comes to mind as a real-world example.Vertiginous Golf, unfortunately, includes a few unplayable holes, where the line between success and failure is both unmarked and razor thin.  The penalty for failure is vastly out of proportion to the value of success -- and scores rapidly balloon out of control, rendering an entire round not much more than an exercise in futility.  And if I want futility, I can just load up my clubs and go play some real golf (which can fairly be described as two shots worthy of Tiger hidden within one hundred twenty worthy of Tigger).On the plus side, this is the worst I have to say about Vertiginous Golf -- but since it's central to game play, it's of importance.The SkinnyOverall, I'll give 7.5/10, though I would strongly recommend the designers re-visit some of the holes and dial it back a little.  I don't expect an ace every time, but neither do I expect to be condemned to ten or more strokes because I missed a tee shot by the faintest of margins.On the cosmetic side, I'd like to suggest allowing the player to choose their ball color (or if that's already in the game, making it more obvious as I haven't found it yet).  We golfers are a superstitious lot, and I (think I) play better with a blue or green ball than with a red one.  :DA course designer would be another welcome addition -- way back in ancient times (i.e., the 1990s), the Jack Nicklaus series of golf games always included course design tools, and some of the fan-made courses were genuinely brilliant.  The vast array of additional free content also kept the JN games playable far longer than most other games released at the same time.Overall, this game is Recommended on the basis of design and creativity, and in the hopes that some of its frustration factor is ironed out by the time of its official release.

Early Access Review
I've not has so much fun playing a crazy golf game since buying 3D Ultra™ Minigolf Adventures well over 4 years ago.  Vertiginous Golf, is not only  beautiflul  to look at , it's deviously more difficult to  score compared to  the older mini golf game.  With local coop available now; and,   as development progresses  with   up to 4 player multiplayer this is going to be a great game to play with your online mates.  I can imagine the laugh your all going to have playing this.   The game is in early access;  if you were lucky enought to buy it via the humble store    a few days ago, you'd have  got it  for half price, right up to its release.The game is a physics based first person exploratory mini golf game  set in a steampunk  universe.  There are loads of  innovations  included such as first person mechanical humming bird that can be utilized to plan your shots, there' s a rewind facility that allows  you to  undo or rewind a shot without losing a stroke (basically a cheat system).  The ball can also be controlled  using the WASD keys, so  rewinding part way, you can then adjust your shot accordingly.  There's a whole host of other  things  included  such as moving obstacles,    mini helicopters, blockers,  platforms, spinners, travelators and other   interesting  items (eg  a glowing semi transparent  trail showing you   your previous shots)  that  help or hinder your progress.  At the moment there are 18 holes with   a further 27 + holes planned in future updates.As an early access game  you can report bugs in the  games forums HERE.You can see  videos  of game play HERE,   HERE   and HERE. Highly recommended even at it's full price of £11.99 ($14.99).  That's over £3 cheaper  if you can find a friend in the US to gift it too you.  ;) "

												Vertiginous Golf, is a puzzle golf game I recently got during the free giveaway event. The game couples relaxing music and visuals with golfing and physics puzzle based gameplay. The world is fantastical and steampunk, this is not a game for someone looking for a legitimate golf sim type of game.  Vertiginous Golf comes with a level creator as well! You can share these custom courses with other players custom course menu.  You can even play these courses in the online multiplayer. A few other things to note are the neat interactive menus in the game, and the character customization, both are neat additions and not something I would expect coming into a game like this.   I can freely say that I have not played much of Vertiginous yet, but  I enjoy the gameplay it offers. I haven't tried much of multiplayer but the population seems to be fairly small, its not surprising since I had not heard of this game until it was offered free for a day.  I would recommend this game to fans of puzzle games, or even golf games, as long as they can tolerate the more fantastical feeling offered here.			"

You could say Vertiginous Golf is the golfing equivalent of Dark Souls, there’s no hand holding going on here and all you’re told is you have to get the ball into the hole at the end of the course. How you do this is completely up to you, do you try and smash it across the whole field, hoping to get some lucky rebounds? Maybe you’re a bit more conservative and like to go for the paths which are enclosed? Maybe you want that “hole-in-one” every time and you have to pitch perfectly in order to get it. Also did I mention this game is as hard as 7 week old bacon?Vertiginous Golf is overflowing with options, which is something you wouldn’t normally see from a game which is tied to a sport. Just on originality alone I think this is a good pick-up. It already has great features while in Early Access and promised future developments look even better. I’d only steer away from this if you have ADD and you need fast hot action all over your face in order to feel satisfied, now go clean yourself up.			"

												Let me begin this review by saying two things: As a gamer, my guilty pleasure has always been Mini-golf games. I have played them through my childhood, but as an adult, I had slacked off. Then--*Gasp*--What do my eyes see? I new mini-golf game on steam! I immediately got it and was thrilled to play it, even at the price point.And the second point is simply this; How dare you expect me to enjoy this heap of junk.The controls are the wonkiest thing on the planet, I feel like I have no kind of control over the ball whastsoever. There is nowhere near enough railing, I found myself constantly falling off of the platforms for no other reason than my putter flinched a little harder than I told it--tried to tell it to.In the story, the concept with the records advancing the plot and rewarding you if you do is really neat. However, making it mandatory to make the hole isn't. I had made it to the end of a hole, after, oh I don't know, 15 storkes because the ball forgot how to stay on the platform, and finally made it to the raised recepticle where the ball was thanks to a ""free stroke"" hole (that just sounds dirty). I was thrilled I had finally made it, only to discover that I missed a record. I couldn't get out. I had to restart the hole because a metal tube spat me out at a point where I couldn't go back. Also, this happened on three different holes.And don't get me started on how bad the Swing Power system is. You could pull the club to the same height three times and get three totally different swings. Oh, And the ball itself! Oh golly gee wilikers, that ball. I have lost more strokes because my ball bounced off of the cup and into the abyss than I care to count. It doesn't matter how slow the ball is going, if I can't just barely nudge it in, it goes flying out and 5 meters away, usually into the abyss. It's unbelieveable. And I'm NOT going to star in on the awful, twitchy camera.SummaryIt may sound like I am just bad at the game and complaining about it, but I have a feel for how a game like this should work. And, frankly, something isn't working here. This game is trying to be something that it just isn't quite yet. Now, I know, what you're thinking, ""Hey, Joe! Give the Devs a break, the game has been in 1.0 for literally three days!"" I know that. I have a lot of games that are still in development in my library. I know how tedious a game can be for the first few months until they patch it up and give it its lolly. So, don't get me wrong, I am still excited to play this game. Just... not right now. My keyboard may need a bandage first.So, until the game is fixed a little bit, I can't and won't recomend it. But, the second those updates happen(they ARE going to happen, right?), I will be chomping at the bits, ready to play. And then I will gladly, openly, and, perhaps even lovingly change my review, but until then, I almost refuse to play it.Until next time (There WILL be a next time, right?);Cheers,SuPeR_J03			"

Early Access Review
								Highly original, beautifully crafted and rock-hard ""mini-golf"" game. I have to put that between brackets because although this is more or less traditional mini-golf, it doesn't look or feel like it at all. Imagine playing minigolf on islands in the sky with twisted, devious and brilliant courses in a steam-punk world remeniscent of Bioshock Infinite.From the moment you start this game up and are greeted with one of the most innovative and immersive menu systems I have ever seen in a computer game you know you are in for something special.As of writing the game is feature complete and I have not noticed any bugs, there are two courses of 9 holes and a training hole. So don't let the Early Acces label scare you off, this is the first EA game I have purchased and I am glad I did. Appart from adding about 30 more holes and tweaking this game could be considered finished.Oh did I mention this game was rock-hard? Don't be surprised to get 20, 30 or even 40 over par on your first attempts at a hole. Getting the first hole in one is going to be an epic challenge.This is obviously a labour of love, the passion the developers have put into this project shines through in every aspect of Vertiginous Golf. You owe it to yourself to give this a shot if you are intrigued, because this is one of the better examples of video games being art without being pretentious. The stylish design and gameplay blend together perfectly and it never feels contrived.I highly recommend this to anybody looking for a beautiful, relaxing but also very challenging experience.			"

												Vertiginous Golf is a game that will either grow on you…or it wont. When I first started playing this game, I got very frustrated with it very quickly. Over time, I learned some of the different features it has to offer, so I experimented with some of these other features before returning to the base part of the game.When you first start playing this game, you have a few different options. There are various 1 player modes, as well as multi player modes to choose from. I started by playing the regular mini putt holes, and worked my way up to playing these holes with the multi player mode. I will say, the holes get drastically more difficult and complex as you move on. Sometimes, in my opinion, the par the holes are set at can be unreasonable, but with that aside, the holes do range in difficulties.This game also gives you a build your own hole option, which I found to be rewarding, because I could take some of my frustrations out that I had with the game, on the self created holes. Some of the obstacles I previously found aggravating and just downright cruel, became amusing in the close to impossible holes I created for myself.NOTE: I got this game for free during a special event, so I recommend this game when it is on sale for a low price. If I were to have actually spent a chunk of change on this game, I would have rated it differently. As I mentioned before, MANY of the holes built into this game leave you asking yourself  “how is it even possible to get it in that many strokes?” or “this hole isn’t even fair!” As I stated earlier in my review however, I changed my attitude with this game because I play it now more as a humorous experiment, instead of a serious challenge.

												It's a case of nice premise, but ultimately boring execution. The story falls back on the inevitable cliches, the controls are a bit clunky, and over all it doesn't do too much to stand out.the biggest problem I have with it is ultimately a lack of consequence. good scores will garner you more money, sure, but on holes where I was getting 20 strokes over par (again, the controls are awkward and touchy) I was still receiving a small reward at the end. The upgrades you can buy with the money are purely cosmetic, and by then end it literally had bored me to sleep. Games should present either a challenge, or give the illusion of one, and this game fails to do either.ultimately, it gets a lost golfball out of ten in my book.			"

								This is a great game and the developers have already added some content and made various improvements.  It may require a painstaking amount of precision and tremendous amounts of trial and error but in the end when it all comes together and you are making par you feel truly accomplished.UPDATE: 7/12/14Being as most reviewers on here have not spent that much time with game (except for rabid) this is the truly unique golf game, that fans of ""wacky"" golf games have been waiting for.  If Kirby's dream course was a turn based strategy game this would be the RTS equal.  This game makes you think more than a puzzle game and react more than a FPS. It is incredibly well made and gets better by the month.  The only downside I can see to recommending this game is that it will affect my positions on the leaderboards. YOU GUYS ROCK. Thanks for making a great game and letting us go along for the ride as I am sure it will become the standard which golf games are measured by.			"

												Disclaimer: I got this for free, so I can't be sure if the price is okay, but...I had great fun with a friend playing this game. Despite the cons other reviews mentioned, it does well what it was designed to do: a minigolf game. The holes are sometimes more complex than it should be, but that's the fun of it. When you play with friends, an inaccurate stroke could send your ball to ""how am I supposed to get to the hole now?!"", which will give you and yours friends a very hilarious time toghether. That alone makes it worth buying this game for a few fun local-coop sessions, not to mention the online part (multiplayers and level builder, which I haven't tried yet).Honestly, I just want to pull more people into this game to creat more holes for me to play XD			"

								Why does miniature golf need to be miniature? Why can't it be the scale of regular golf, so I'm putting through three hundred yards of bumpers and windmills and rollercoasters? Also, why can't mini-golf have lots of mechanical hummingbirds?Obviously, we've all asked these questions. Now Vertiginous Golf is here to answer them.It's insanity, but it all works well. It's fun and polished, especially for a tiny indy production like this one. The multiplayer is the star of the show. Charming and imaginative describe virtually every inch of what exists in Vertiginous Golf.My only real complaint is lack of content. It needs more courses. Partly, that's Early Access. But, the future goals say the final game will have 45+ courses, and it will need to be double that, at least, because it IS miniature golf. Real golf is about honing nuances. Miniature golf, at any scale, is far more dependent on novelty factor. As cool and robust as these course designs are, they're not anything you're going to play fifty or a hundred times. The game needs so many holes that by the time you finish the final holes, you can no longer remember the early holes clearly. That's the only way this will ever be anything more than an incredibly cool way to spend an evening or two. The only way this will ever be a real game.My hope is that this will turn into a more expensive game, with far, far more content, instead of remaining a cheap game which inevitably starts pushing the edges of its content after just a few hours. At the moment, it reminds me a lot of the disc golf sector of the ps3 game Sports Champions - BRILLIANT, but give me more of it. A *lot* more of it.			"

												Overall a fun game that you should grab when it goes on sale.Please note that any reference to multi-player in this review refers to local. This game does offer online multi-player but I have not tried it and don't really plan to.Pros:-Fun multi-player-Beginner level single-player story course is REALLY fun!-a free-roaming menu area where you can run around in the rain, visit the customization shop, or go straight to playing the game (it would be cool if there was more explorable content here, but it is still cool as is).-Humming bird and club customizations are really cool (the character clothes are cool too but you only see them for a few seconds before you start a course.)-more game modes than I have currently tried at the moment.-level editor is a nice touch-creative courses-story mode is actually very interesting. The sound clips you get throughout the single player story really help you understand the lore and world of the game which is fairly enjoyable. Cons:- if you have multiple controllers hooked up, they control everything (all players). It would be good to have an option for designated player controls rather than pass n' play.-Player created levels are a bit disorganized. It would be nice if this feature could be done through steam workshop so you could see more info on the levels when browsing.-Multiplayer does not give you coins to unlock accessories or club skins. You need to play single-player for that.-Single-player courses(and most courses in general) get mind numbingly difficult once you start the intermediate levels.-The camera could be better at times. Some times I can't see where I am putting because of a tree, wall, low ceiling, etc...-in multiplayer, all players share the same club and humming-bird skins (character skins too but thats not important cause you dont see it in game). It would be nice to have the option for players to have different humming bird and club skins.			"

												Vertiginous Golf? More like Pretentious Golf. OR Bioshock Golf: The Game. I'm unsure if I can adequately express quite how much the characters in this game love hearing themselves talk. You play as a silent protagonist playing golf via virtual reality projection of a sort to play on floating platforms in the sky. The story is all told by rambling characters who spent 3 hours poring over a thesaurus for the most ostentatious way of saying anything at all. At first, it was charming, but after about 2 hours of it, I was dreadfully tired of it, but to attempt to follow the plot, you have to listen to the recordings which you gain by touching them with your golf ball. I wound up having a friend stream to watch me play just under the last half of the game, and she found the people prattling on even more annoying than I did.That said, this is actually a pretty good game. It's a steampunk floating mini golf course where you can occasionally rewind bad swings, use contraptions in the environment to get your ball where you want it to go, and use a club that lets you hit in a straight line, or one that lets you make it come up off of the ground strategically. I'll be honest: I was absolute rubbish at this game. I had more than 40 swings on a par 4 level, and the last half of the game I was doing absolutely miserably at it on a regular basis. Despite all of that, I had fun. I'm glad this game was made, even if the characters drone on a bit more than I found enjoyable. This is far from the type of game I would normally ever play, but I picked it up on the cheap as part of a Humble Bundle. I do recommend this game, though I would say $5.00 should be the most a person ought to pay for it, if that much. I had a good time.			"

The game works well, isnt buggy or broken, its not even that difficult.If you can get it on sale or you got a free copy from a friend, its worth getting together and playing.You can play golf and attack each other.Point system is a bit broken, but other than that, pretty good.

												Very hard mini golf game, get ready to be punished by the levels, specially some community created ones. It's very fun to play with friends, you also can activate items to punish opponents even further. The game is not fully polished but works very decently, for 5 dolars or less it's a very good buy.Pros:++ Multiplayer with friends.+   Nice graphics (Not very optimized in terms of CPU and graphic card use).+   Levels creation tool (if you want to create your own holes or play the ones made by the community).+   Creative story courses.+   Character, clubs, ball and pet customization.+   Can use your flying pet to get a good view of the hole and prepare your next shot.+   You can also chip, not only putt.+   Interesting super powers and rewind key.Cons:- not very friendly UI, take some time to get accustomed to it.- Multiplayer gets stuck sometimes (not frequently).- Room creation in multiplayer is a bit funky, sometimes it doesn't appear in the list for other players to join (you gotta exit the game and load it again to solve it).If you see it in discount, get some copies and invite your friends, you will get fun. ;)			"

												This is one of those games where a meh button would apply. The gameplay isn't bad, but on some of the holes I feel that the par is too low. The courses are pretty neat. So is the bird you can fly around the course to view it. The character model looks awful, but that isn't too big of a deal. Also, I have had trouble with accidentally trying to use RMB to aim and ending up wasting a shot.Pros:Levels are designed to be interestingWorld looks fairly niceBird controlCons:Bad character modelsSomewhat awkward controlsMildly unforgivingOverall, I would give this a 5.5/10. It definitely is not worth the $10, but for anything less than $5, I would say it was a good price. Want to reiterate, this is not a bad game. It just isn't a particularly good one.I got the key for this game from a steam group called Accidentally Reviewed. I thank them greatly for distributing free keys for reviewing and encourage anyone and everyone to join the group.			"

												Vertiginous Golf has its heart in the right place. It's an interesting indie game that attempts to take mini golf and spruce it up with a fantastic enviroment and cool hole machines. The controls were decent and worked well for the gameplay. I liked the inclusion of multiplayer and the overal theme of a steampunk world. The issue lies in the presentation. Why have a 3D area when a menu system would have sufficed? I found myself wanting to explore the world and not play the actual game. I enjoyed the rain an the music in the game area. That is never good. Still, I think this game deserves your dollar. Pick it up on sale and try it out.			"

												Claimed this for free, and got what I paid for.Playing begins by sitting with your own free will into electric chair, and then you find yourself from dreamland of golf.This must be absolutely the only reason why electric chairs exist.Gameplay itself is well explained and controls feel good. There is nice amount of maps originally within the game and physics are made with good sense of humour.I recommend that you try at least once this, if you decided to grab it for free.			"

Early Access Review
								(October 9th)I just recently got this game and already my friends and I love it. We got it after the multiplayer update and have had a blast messing around it. The singleplayer and multiplayer have multiple options for you to choose from. So you can either make it challenging for yourself by removing the bug influencer, playing on a only green map, or if with your friends play with weapons.There are also multiple ways to play the multiplayer matches. So far from what I've played they have a regular golf match (9 holes) and they have a race type. Now typically for the regular match it's kind of like a race but you can go at your own pace. My friends and I personally like to take turns and whatnot but you can play however you want. So I haven't put as many hours into this game as some of the other people here, but I LOVE this game. Just because you play a course doesn't mean you can't go back and play it again. With how the holes are setup, there are multiple ways about getting to your goal. So if you mess up, keep going, and come back some other time and try to beat your score on how you did it before. There are just so many possibilities.Now this game is currently in Early Access but it's still a great game for where it is at. So here are some Pros and Cons that I have come to find about this game.Pros:-Replay Value (a ton, I really don't see how I could run out of options especially if Steam Community gets involved)-Lovely Graphics (freaking beautiful)-Some minor customization on your playing style (no bug influence, yes/no weapons)-Very smooth gameplay (I play on Splendid graphics and framerate is great)-Easy concepts to grasp (Left mouse camera, right mouse shoot) (there is more but you get the picture)-Online Multiplayer (little buggy but whatever, still cool)-Hilarious to laugh at friends as you explode their ball into oblivion (bombs are awesome. You can explode their ball out of the hole)-Nine 9 hole courses so far (increases in difficulty each one)-Button customization (don't like how it's setup? No prob, set it to what you want)-8 player multiplayer (freaking 8. I haven't had that many friends on here yet but seriously, imagine the chaos of 8 people placing traps for others. Huehuehuehue)Cons: -Online Multiplayer Servers:            Everytime you go to multiplayer you search a region to play in. For some reason it has it set to Europe as default for me when I live in the US. I would like to click on US and search for things there, but it has to search for every game in the regions, which could take some time, stalling for even longer. So if there was a way to have a choice on which region you want to play would be nice.-Online Multiplayer Options:           Yes you have a lot of options to choose from, and that is awesome, BUT, if you try to change the course instead of repeating the level, you might accidentally mess up and have to restart the hosted game.-Online Multiplayer Lobby:           I love the fact that you can create your own lobby, it's cool, but you don't have many options in your lobby. Your lobby is always public, so anyone can join. Which is sometimes irritating if I'm waiting for my friends to join. So they join whatever, you can ask them to leave, but they don't always. So you have to restart the lobby. Why? Because you have no kick option.-Weapon selection:           This is kind of minor but I wish there was a way to choose your weapon with a specific button rather then having to press 'c' 4 times to get what I want. Maybe I can select how I want to set it up and I'm being stupid. I haven't explored all the button options yet, but I haven't seen any options for it. -Camera:            It's pretty good for the most part, but sometimes you get stuck near a pole and can't see where you are trying to put. Other games have fixed this by making those see through but everything is solid, so on the rare occasion if you get stuck, you kind of have to hope you hit it to the right spot because you can't see.Yes I have some issues with the online multiplayer, but I can't blame the developers, this option just came out October 6th so I don't expect this feature to be perfect, there are some things anyone/anything can improve on. There are also some other features that they said they plan on bringing to the game later on. Such as a LOT more customization. Avatars, Putters, Golf Balls, and Levels. Freaking Levels. They said they plan on bringing in Steam Community to this game. Players from all around will be creating their own levels with the level customization will be used (they plan on bringing that and hopefully will). There is so much they can do with this game, I'm just so excited to see what they will do. So long story short, this game rocks my socks off. I love mini golf in real life and this game really only limits people to their imagination. I hope to see this game keep going and come out with all the features they plan on. TL;DR - Den outta Den			"

								If you have an itch for a wacky golf/marble madness style game, you could do much worse than Vertiginous Golf. Admittedly, I'm not that far in but I've enjoyed what I've played so far. Mechanically very good, and oozing with style, I definitely recommend the game. I also find it super relaxing, if you're into that sort of thing.			"

												Whilst I've not yet touched the singleplayer, the multiplayer is solid. The mechanics allow for a new spin on a classic game which allows for hours of fun. Not to mention the level editor (Whilst a bit iffy at times, and can become laggy due to complexity - not an issue in the game however) allows for far more replayabilty. Whilst I cant recommend this game for those looking for a singleplayer experience, if you have a couple friends together and are willing to part with a bit of cash, you can have a lot of fun with this game.

Early Access Review
								This game is really pretty cool. It's a minigolf game with a really cool fantasy-esque atmosphere and neat little contraptions all over. You build up power with swings and can use either a rewind button or a little jet thingie on your ball to move it slightly where you want. At first it seems like rewind is incredibly OP but the game gets fairly challenging and fairly fast. To the point it might even get a bit frustrating to some people. Luckily I was playing it with my girlfriend so I did honestly have a good time watch us both screw up a few times. The game's got pretty good graphics and a neat art style and is surprisingly not too computer intensive too. It also has online now which they just added. I don't know if I'll do that myself as I'm more content with local, but it's cool to have the option to play with friends. Apparently has weapons and other fun junk if you want. Another reason I really enjoyed this game. The devs are really cool and seem to be very active even in the steam forums. I had a glitch that didn't allow me to play local multiplayer and made a thread here. The devs worked with me on it and in just a day they released a patch to fix it. That's something you don't see too often when it comes to early access and other junk and is certainly a breath of fresh air. I will admit the game is a tad big buggy and has the occasional physics or weird clipping bug, but its kind of hard to stay mad at it when it's an early access game. I expect it to be ironed out as time goes on. The devs were very open with what their update schedule is and what their plans are and have so far done what they said. Anyways, it's just a really nice mini golf game. If you want to play a nice relaxing (or a fairly challenging) game of minigolf you should really give it a shot. even though it is early access, it's a fun enough game even as it is right now and even goes on sale fairly often. its just fun ok. devs were swell and is looks cool. Not expensive either. Thanks ilu			"

												Minigolf in the skySo this game is basically minigolf except there's tons of spots where your ball can fall off. You know that feeling in Mario Kart when you fall off the edge? Well you'll get that feeling in this game a lot.  However, this game makes up for that by not requiring you to score a certain amount to proceed. It also has a shop. YES A FREAKING SHOP. It's cosmetic, but still I love buying things in games. Honestly though you should see for yourself how unique this game is.Watch me play through the first story

												At the surface, Vertiginous Golf looks like another generic minigolf game that has a steampunk theme to it. Just like those never ending various themed pinball games, there are many themed minigolf games like this one and I'm not gonna lie, this one isn't on the top of the ""15 minigolf games you should play before you stop being a gamer because you only play games like Vertiginous Golf, a minigolf game that's set in a dystopian steam punk world where the player casually sits down on electrical chair to get shocked into a world in the skies above an alternate world where the smog filled, dark, constant raining reality seems like a bad dream"" list. It'll probably not be on the list even if the list was 30 minigolf games. But this game, this ""minigolf"" game is something much more, something that's hard to figure it out at first glance.If you're playing this game, or planning to play this game, or maybe you even finished the game and have or haven't figure out the deeper part of the game, then that probably means you've played a lot of minigolf games. This isn't the kind of game that someone who's not a fan of minigolf games would play, most people would just look at it, go ""huh"" and move on. So if you're not one of those ""lucky""could someone who's first minigolf game to be this one called lucky? Would they just play all the courses and miss the true purpose of this game? Can those people called lucky? Maybe they are, for them to not have the same fate as me, not knowing what this game contains. Maybe they are lucky to not have their minds filled with regrets and thoughts about this mad, dysfunctional society we live in few who stumbled upon this game, then that probably means you're a veteran minigolf game player and you've probably played all the big titles like 3D Ultra Minigolf and Planet Minigolf or maybe even this classic browser minigolf game[www.whyy.org]. And you probably know how most of these minigolf game goes. Well if you think this game is like 3D Ultra Minigolf, Planet Minigolf or even this classic browser minigolf game[www.whyy.org] then you're right, it's just another minigolf game, and if you like minigolf (like me) then do give this a try. It may lack polish compared to big budget minigolf games like 3D Ultra Minigolf, Planet Minigolf or  even this classic browser minigolf game[www.whyy.org], but hey, more minigolf.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is very promising and well worth the money, even at the stage it is in now.The holes are very imaginative and fun to play. I've played through each course a couple times now and I'm still having a lot of fun. I will say that the hole layouts are a bit confusing. These aren't par 3-4 holes! The complexity is slightly annoying at first but adds to the replay value. It's been fun for me to realize ""secrets"" to getting the best path through a hole.The shot strength is another mechanic that you just have to get used to. After my couple hours of play I am now pretty certain of how far my shots will go.There is plenty of help in this game, easing the difficulty level down. There is a flashback feature to redo shots. There is also an aftertouch to sway the ball after hitting it. There will apparently later be a hardcore mode with those disabled if you find it too easy.The atmosphere and genre of the game is great. The music is calming and the atmosphere serene.I'm very excited for the future course editor and new courses. The developers seem very active in the forums and seem to greatly value the community. I have faith that this game will get expanded in the ways that they say it will and it is pretty fun now to hold me over!			"

A Playable Golf GameConsidering this game went for free during its promo, it is possible to get this game very cheap now. It provides a good amount of fun for a while if you play with a friend or some friends. The courses at the start are not too challenging and easy to understand, however later on in the game the courses become very complex with the addition of many objects that manipulate the balls movement. It runs well and with the ability to make your own courses and play other peoples in addition to the multiplayer, it makes it at least enough content to be worth a few dollars.			"

A Playable Golf GameConsidering this game went for free during its promo, it is possible to get this game very cheap now. It provides a good amount of fun for a while if you play with a friend or some friends. The courses at the start are not too challenging and easy to understand, however later on in the game the courses become very complex with the addition of many objects that manipulate the balls movement. It runs well and with the ability to make your own courses and play other peoples in addition to the multiplayer, it makes it at least enough content to be worth a few dollars.			"

Other than that, the only thing that would need mentioning is all of the nasty bugs in this game. However, I've already named them all on the main discussion so I will refrain from retyping them all here. I'd reccommend this game to anyone who is a fan of golfing games, but not in it's current state. If you plan on spending money on this game I suggest waiting until it is stable, so that one may have an enjoyable experience whilst playing.			"

												Have you ever told yourself, ""How can a golf game be completely hard and make you p*ssed off?"" Well, Vertiginous Golf answers that question for you. I don't know what type of audience they were trying to grab, but here is the short and sweet review.You can pause time (for single player only), rewind time, curve your ball, you walk around in a small space of a map in first person (you go into a store to start/play games, and enter another store to buy new gear), a hummingbird follows you around (you can use this bird to spectate and scout a hole) and there are also weapons that you can have in the game (I never used this because it sounds horrible to have in a golf game). It's a Steampunk version of Golf. The graphics are decent and the music somewhat peaceful while waiting in a lobby/playing games. Last but not least there are challenging holes in which you can get 40+ strokes on. There are also community made holes, but we haven't tried those out.It's a decent golf game, but I think it's one of the few golf games on the market that is challenging while playing the Classic Mini-Golf gamemode.

								This game is as advertised.  A delightful steam-punk infused mini golf game that is often challenging, and dang it, even frustrating a times.  However, when you sink those difficult shots it feels great, and the whole aesthetic of the game is very appealing.  I quite enjoy how you start the game outside of a quaint shop, inside of which you will find the menu that launches the game proper.  With regular updates hitting frequently since I purchased the game, I'm definitely feeling like I got my monies worth.  I haven't even had a chance to try multiplayer yet but I'm sure it would be a great time indeed.			"

Not something I'd personally spend hours with, but nice enough to forget about the world for a few minutes to an hour every now and then. Not so sure about the price (R$19,99) and I fail to see the appeal for the gold pack, but seems like something a group of friends could benefit from.			"

												I understand that this golf game is supposed to take place in a steampunk setting and the overall presentation does lend itself to that aim. The problem is that this premise also gets in the way (for me) of enjoying a golf experience that is very much flawed in every aspect. Playing Vertiginous Golf hardly feels like I'm playing a golf game. While the physics engine is serviceable, the holes and their gimmicks simply get in the way of what golf or mini golf are supposed to feel like. Traversing each hole is cumbersome and awkward. The alternative-style (steampunk?) obstacles scattered throughout each hole just aren't interesting, nor do they add anything new and worthwhile to the golfing experience. There's also very little content and each hole is very similar to the next. Yes, there is the opportunity to create your own holes and to play through holes created by the community but they honestly all look, feel and play the same. This is a less than ambitious golf game with little to no variety. I would rather play PGA Tour Golf for DOS, which was released in 1990.Vertiginous Golf is mediocre.			"

												Would love to recommend this game, but can't.  The ""menu"" is weird and I'd much rather just a standard pick what you want menu than walking around.  That's not a major issue to me.  A lot of polish is still needed, inviting friends to multiplayer games would be a nice addition.  The game play I've done has been fun.  This is not a realistic mini golf simulator, and I'm OK with that, if you take it for what it is the game play is fine.  What has killed this for me is playing for almost an hour and never being able to finish a single multiplayer round.  One of us always hits a bug where they can't take a shot, can't reset their shot, and can't bring up the menu to quit the hole.  Camera controls still work, can still chat and watch other players shoot, etc.  The only solution we have is to alt + F4 and start over again.  Until we are able to finish a round there's no way I can recommend someone else buy this.			"

												My first impressions of vertiginous golf were something like: ""neat, I like minigolf games and that one looks cool.""  As I loaded up the game, however, I ran into some problems.  The game automatically mapped the controls to a joystick I had plugged in, and I spun around uncontrollably.  ""Okeydoke,"" I said, ""I'll just rebind the controls!""  Oh, dear reader, was that ever a mistake.  By the time I was done, I had a completely unplayable game on my hands.  I didn't even have the option to reset the controls to default, and I was lost.I was fully prepared to give up on this game, and move on to the next game on my backlog... but I decided to throw up a halfhearted message about my predicament on the steam community boards.  I was TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY when one of the developers replied in an hour, gave a solution, and explained the problem!I've been golfing for about 3 hours now, and I've enjoyed every second.  There is a story mode and deep running narrative throughout the game that is a true pleasure to discover.  The tale is told in a somewhat odd, disjointed, rambling way which I've decided matches the setting perfectly.  The minigolfing aspect is sometimes referred to as ""dark souls minigolf"" in the threads, due to the complexity and challenge.  The art and music are patently strange and elaborate.  I've only played the single player so far, but I look forward to sharing the multiplayer with some friends soon!			"

												If you're looking for a fun virtual golfing experience, this game probably isn't for you. I found this game to be very dry. Some of the mechanics of the game are interesting, but not enough to keep me playing. From an artistic standpoint, the concept of a dystopian steampunk mini-golf game doesn't really work. This game isn't terrible per se, but definitely not worth your time. I'd give it a 4/10.			"

												5.9/10 - Steampunk Mini-Putt With FriendsI originally didn't care much for this game but after playing it some more I've decided it's not too bad. The graphics are pretty good, and the maps are indeed Steam Punk in nature. If Bioshock Infinite had a Mini Putt DLC this is what it would look like. A game of putt putt played in the clouds.This game doesn't do it for me as much as I'd like. I love all the elements of this game but find myself getting bored quickly.Worth $5-8 Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

												A very interesting and different putt putt golf game.  So far the story mode is annoying me a little but since this is supposed to be more than just putt putt golf I will listen to it.  I would say for some they would need to mute this to enjoy the game but the thing is the option is there to get rid of all the sounds you want.  In regards to content it seems there is quite a bit of it with the story mode, multiplayer and the content created holes or courses.  I think with this creation mode it definitely gives the game more life as in you'll have more reason to play it in the many years ahead.  So with that all said anyone that likes putt putt golf and is ok with having a twist to it get this game.			"

												I am going to start this out right. I don't like golf. I DO like this game. Vertiginous Golf is a impressively fun golf game with tight controls and some interesting game mechanics such as a scout to survey the track and the ability to go back in time to reverse a fatal swing. All in all I'm enjoying this game and highly reccomend this game (on sale) to anybody!			"

								Vertiginous Golf is an awesome little miniputt-like game. The concept behind the game is compelling and the courses are challenging. Definitely gives off a lot of steampunk-esque vibes and I personally love that. In it's current state it's a barebone uniqe miniputt game but it does have a lot of potential to be something new and unique.If you prefer watching gameplay over reading I have a spotlight for this game on my Youtube channel.

												A lot of missed opportunities.While it is fun to play with friends, most of the fun comes from making fun about the broken or incomplete state of the game rather than from enjoying the actual game itself. I just can't imagine why it was decided to ship the game without things like a visible indicator for whos turn it is or a scoreboard at the end of a course instead of just beeing kicked back to the ""menu"".Also: Why is there a working 3D Sound-Engine implemented in the game, when it is only used to blast your ears with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ music if you happen to shoot the ball next to one of the speakers, while the physics engine at the same time is a buggy mess?

												Follow my curation : http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9273374-exorio/Just had couple minutes of it so take it as first impression.The physics are quite nice, and... well it's a minigolf game where you hit a ball to a hole, avoiding obstacles and such. What else is there in a minigolf game?On the positive side, I really never seen a minigolf game done so extravagantly, the graphics are great for its genre, and the themes is really out of place, at least for a minigolf game, that is. That's a very risky and very bold move from the developers, and I should say I really like it.However, controls will take a while to get use too, and seems that this game is built from ground up to play with controllers (xbox 360 in this case). Mouse & keyboard are kinda wonky.Also optimizations are not really good, since I don't get satisfactory framerate on my i7 PC.Conclusion? If you like golf with a twist, this probably for you.For me, I should say this is just not my cup of tea. However, I would recommend it to those who love this genre tho specially those who wanted something really new, and out of place.So yeah. I recommend it.			"

 A Tricky Final Decision When I was 7 years old going out to mini putt golf courses with my family, I always wondered why the rules say that we can't all hit it at once without turns, you know, a race, if you will. This game, takes the rule of turn based putt golf and ignores it. Yes, asymmetric golf game. Its as fun as it sounds and unfortunately there's no online community now. No one really plays this game anymore. It's time has passed. However, I will recommend it just because it has a decent single player mode and user created golf courses. I bought this game (4 of them actually) from a bundle on Humble Bundle for about 5 dollars (plus other games). I've been meaning to get rid of these copies and play with some friends. I eventually did, but no one still plays it. Anyway, let's get on with the review!The game play is in this first person perspective until you start the game. You'll find it shocking that terrible puns will be in this review since to start a golf game, you have to sit in a chair and electrocute yourself directly into your character's head. You can also go to a store next to this place and customize your character. Its not the deepest of character customization, but it works well. Like I said, in the first paragraph you can have asymmetric multiplayer golf. Meaning, that you all can play at once without taking turns, which I think is really cool. However, the game has no community now and is pretty much on it's death bed right now. I do love the custom golf course holes you and other people can make and upload. You can try out other people's golf course holes and see how they are. You can even rate them and give them a confidence boost or a cruel reality that it needs work as they tearfully take off the golf cap and throw their putter down in disappointment as you single handedly destroy their dreams. Good job there buddy, I hope you feel better about your one star rating you gleefully gave. Moving on, this game is physics based, obviously, and you need to hit the golf ball through multiple obstacles, including: Ramps, fans, the bottomless pit below you, and pools. This game has a lot to throw at you and its a lot of fun. You can add these things in your golf courses if you decide to make them. There's also the developer created courses. There's not a lot but there's enough to keep you busy for a couple hours. Sometimes, they're challenging and other times too easy. I found them to be fun but the user created courses are much more interesting. You can use a wedge club for chipping the ball for a quick short cut. There's certain areas where you are prohibited from using them and you should make sure you put the chipper away when you need to putt. You have a little bird that you can customize as well to a lesser degree and you can use him to scout the golf course, which is a neat feature, nothing new but its definitely more necessary in this game. You can use a controller or keyboard and mouse, both work pretty well and are easy to use. I  never had a complaint about the controls of this game since they make sense. You use the mouse to hit the ball by holding and clicking the left mouse button and moving the mouse back and forward. Of course you have to swing forward once you have the certain amount of power you want. You can be like what other people did and hit it as hard as you can and pray that it doesn't fall into the bottomless pit.The sound, I honestly turned off. It can be a bit obnoxious hearing your bird companion flapping around in your head phones. There's not much to talk about. The sound design was just not that great overall and there was no music either so you can just use your own on your computer or MP3. If you want to count the music you listen to as part of the game then I say that everyone should enjoy the music in this game then.The graphics are fairly meh, but definitely not the worst. The game can look kinda dull and lifeless at times even though the game play isn't dull or lifeless. The 3D models aren't bad but the character models look just plain awkward. They always have a blank expression on their face. To be fair, you only see them when you voluntarily give yourself the chair. The game can look great and all if you design the levels to be more aesthetically pleasing to the eye. Still, this doesn't break the game and it more than works if you can get passed that some levels can be fairly dull looking.The replayability can be through the roof if you consider all the hundreds (maybe thousands?) of user created golf holes that were made. Its seriously works well in a game like this where you could have endless amounts of new golf holes to play through. It was a smart move by the developers to add that in. The game has no multiplayer community now so you might as well treat this as a single player experience from now on if you do get this game.It was tricky to decide if I should recommend this or not but I enjoyed this game, overall. If you can get it cheap, since I'm unaware of the full price of it, then I'd say get it if you like mini golf because this game really makes mini golf more insane to play. Bring a friend if you can and play a hole together because you will have a blast playing it with them.			"

												Hey everyone, just wanted to share my own opinion on this mixed review game. I got this game for free somehow (can't remember how) and i haven't played it a whole lot. but the time that i've spent in it has been enjoyable. I skipped the story, and had no idea there was one until i read other reviews. The game itself is pretty awesome. i like it a lot. Setting: Steampunk minigolf. The controls: Not bad. many people are complaining but it's very simple. left click and move to rotate/move camera, scroll to zoom in/out. hold right click and move back to adjust power and then let go to swing and hit the ball. I have had no problems with the controls, they all seem pretty natural to me. Plus, you get to scout ahead with a steam machine bird so you can plan your shots better. The railings: yeah.. that's one where i have a slight problem with. There are a lack of railings in the game, so many times my ball will fly off of the map. the levels themselves are pretty awesome though. always challenging in one way or another. The Ball: kind of bouncy. it's like a ping pong ball. The Golf Clubs:""you only get to choose from two"" - it's minigolf man. you only need one. overall: 7.5/10 - I'd recommend the game for anyone who enjoys minigolf games.			"

												The controls are terribleThe course designers insist on placing scaffolding and other ugly assets into your view; this causes nausea and claustrophobia in what should be otherwise a relaxing game -- it is golf after all right?The Camera keeps resetting on each turn, and faces the wrong direction each turn.This combined with the controls and visual obstructions as mentioned above have created an awful experience that you have to re-live every single swing.The authors have clearly not played their own game or gone through any play-testing whatsoever, the single core mechanic of a golf game relies on the camera and control of the club.Lastly, there is some sort of vasaline filter over the game, making everything blurred and hurts my eyes after 4 minutes of playing this 'game'.Uninstalled on the 5th minute mark.

												Steampunk mini-golf. Roll that around in your head for a moment. What does that even mean? Are the holes peppered with gears and pneumatic devices? Is your golfer dressed in a cast-iron top hat and useless multi-colored goggles? Does the course look like a dungeon from Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura? The answer is way less interesting than any of that, and it's a concept bolted onto a pretty mediocre golf game to begin with.Booting the game drops you directly into the barren, rain-soaked streets of some Victorian ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ town. The shop in front of you lets you select a mini-golf course high in the clouds to experience, and then literally zaps you in the brain to transport your consciousness there. Up in the sky, you putt your way around various 9-hole courses with no continuity between holes; each is floating off on its own in a sea of clouds. There are no NPCs, no clever signs or environments, and no real indication of a world outside that first street and your orbiting golf holes. I admit the stark intro makes good on their ""dystopian"" feel mentioned on the store page, but... why? Why make a mini-golf game feel cold and uninviting? And why do nothing with that on the actual holes?The only indication that you are playing steampunk golf on said actual holes are the occasional conveyors, tubes, and fans. Other than that, it's trails and ramps of astroturf, arranged in overly-complicated ways. Vertiginous Golf's main problem is that all its holes are too sprawling, with too many traps. There are conveyors that take your ball away from the hole, fans that blow it off ledges, ramps that lead nowhere, and entire levels of vertical holes designed to punish you. A perfect example is the Extra Stroke holes, special side holes on some greens that take a stroke off your score if you sink them. But you have a limited number of putts to get to them and they tend to be arranged in trap locations, so if you don't make it in time, your score on that hole is boned. There are rewind and reset functions for individual shots but they're overly restrictive, meaning if you don't use them the moment you think you might be in trouble, it's probably too late.There's a shop next to the golf one, where you can buy all kinds of clothes and gaudy clubs for your golfer using the money you earn vertiginously golfing. These can earn you money bonuses to... buy more clothes. Aesthetically they're pointless, because your golfer is invisible on the course! Limited to just the cash bonuses, the unlocks feel tacked-on and mostly useless, much like the steampunk theme and dystopian airs. If Vertiginous Golf was a good golf game, with interesting and fun holes to navigate, I could overlook the senseless trappings, but sadly that's the last thing you're going to get here.			"

												Vertiginous Golf has about as much to do with golf as Trackmania has to do with Formula One, which is to say, not much at all. It's more of a puzzle game than anything else, in which you will typically find yourself double (or triple) digits over par until you figure out exactly how to approach each hole. Then you'll spend more time working on your technique. ""Get mad and quit"" will probably come up now and then too. Hey, golf isn't for everybody.			"

												vertiginousvəːˈtɪdʒɪnəsadjectiveextremely pretentious or sophomoric.""Vertiginous Golf is so deep, man, you just don't get it.""relating to or affected by hipsterdom.The controls are about as tight as your mother after a night with her ""dance"" instructor, evidenced by the fact that the rewind feature is not so much introduced as a ""Whoops, didnt quite get that shot, try again, bucko"" and more like ""♥♥♥♥ it, just hit it. Hit it, see what happens and rewind. Why are you even aiming jesus you ♥♥♥♥ing nerd."" Thats if you can even see where the hell youre even meant to be going. Some holes are less golf and more unfinished Rube Goldberg tracks.The free stroke system used only serves to reinforce the aforementioned horrendous aiming and precision, or lack thereof, as it requires you to continually place shots which not only shoot your ball to exactly where it needs to be but also cost nothing. Miss? Well youre stuck somewhere you dont want to be and its cost you a shot. Plus another to get out. And another to be where you want to. Fantastic. Now you could ignore them and just play it straight but then youll never break par.Interesting and uncommon aesthetics absolutely wasted on a mechnically flawed game.And why the hell try to stick a dystopian storyline over mini golf?

												An interesting steam-punk take on a mini golf game but a golf game should be easy and relaxing to play and this game is neither. In this game the graphics are busy, blurry and hard on the eyes. I had to lower graphic effects to make it somewhat comfortable viewing. The sound and music are dull. The ball physics aren't great and the ball doesn't stay in the hole so that removes any satisfaction of puttting the ball. When you do complete a hole there's an annoying steam machine bouncing in your view. I only played a few holes but the courses got complicated quickly with wind machines, ramps and conveyors. It was not enjoyable and quickly became a stressful gameplay experience than a relaxing one so unlikely I will return to play any more of it.			"

Although equipped with a time reversing gadget, I am still unable to have some ideas on the game: maybe it was my obligation to the swf-based mini-golfs, or maybe it's the game's own problem.Well, I felt extremely lucky to install when it was still free: I saved myself a few dollars on the not-so-worthy mini-golf game. Again, that twitchy human being is NOT COMFORTING AT ALL.			"

												This Minigolf game is atrocious, vile, and simply ""Unfun"".The game's overall style is victorian or steampunk clashed with minigolf based somewhere in the clouds.  It's as if Bioshock Infinite's Columbia had a really really terrible minigolf course.  The game starts you outside of 2 buildings, one being the minigolf room and the other a clothing store, the rest of the buildings are off in the distance and look very low rez and there are invisible walls.  Inside the minigolf room there are rows of chairs and a terminal at the end, kinda looks like a barber shop.  Once you select your course from the terminal you sit in a chair and get electrocuted or something.  Then you load into the course.The music is very repeative, the mouse controls are flipped for some reason, left mouse is aim right is fire.  The corse design is punishing, even in the first few levels.  I consider myself decent skilled at most minigolf games and while i scored 3 under par on the first course, including a hole in one, the second course had me already at 2 over par for very very thoughlessly designed courses.Overall, I would give this game a pass.

Visuals are alright but the theme is a bit dulling (an opinion I built up in my time considering getting this before I got it for free). The sensitivity on absolutely everything is annoying as hell - especially the power for shots. I can drag my mouse an inch and instantly be at full power, and the fine line between hitting it too hard or short when using hold and release controls is so thin I cannot play this to any degree of accuracy.

												This game is one of the most punishing games I have ever played. It's what I imagine groundhog day would be like if you (Spoiler Alert) didn't have the options of sleeping with Andie McDowell or Punching Stephen Tobolowsky in the face. It leaves you longing for death like when Bill Murray drove off the cliff with Punxsutawney Phil in the car.			"

												The problem with Vertiginous Golf is that for all the flash and thought put into it, it lacks the very basic thing that makes a golf/mini golf game enjoyable: physics. The amount of glitches I had found in my short time playing is pretty much unforgivable. If you're going to make a phyics based game, please, make sure you have a strong foundation and THEN add all the flavor you want.			"

												This game.....Where do I begin?Besides having terrible controls and a very meh atmosphere, the only reason I decided to even try this out was to attempt to have fun with my friends. Good luch with that.The multiplayer function is absolutly atrocious, having no way to be able to connect directly to friends. My friends and I literally spent 20 minutes trying to get all three of us to connect to a single game, without any luck. This game could have been fun, if we were able to play it together. The server browser is also very terrible, as it gives you 4 pages of servers list, with a whole 1 page actually shows server. And as it would have it, most, if not all, of the available games are always locked.But no such luck, as this excuse for a multiplayer game can't even function as a time waster. It would probably be easier to find the secrets of the universe than to try to connect to friends. I wouldn't wish this experience apon my worst enemy. Maybe if the multiplayer aspect of this ""multiplayer"" game actually worked, I would've enjoyed it, but until the multiplayer is fixed, this is a complete waste of time. Please Surprise Attack, make a way to directly connect to a friend or make a functioning server browser. Then, maybe then, I will give the game another shot, with a clean slate.			"

												Nice little slow paced game, shows some potential. But...Things that can be done better include enhancing the mechanics and controls. It's a tad bit frustrating to have to drag the aim. Would be nice to incorporate the mouse movement as the aim. Changing the look/aim sensitivity didn't quite make the click and drag system as responsive as I would like. Too slow. Would like to be able to speed past the moment after you hit the ball. Any point. It's terribly boring and frustrating to be hitting the ball off an edge, and have to wait, unable to press the ESC key to reset the shot even when you know you've failed.I really want this game to be fun, and I know I still suck, but I just keep finding myself to be annoyed by the awful aspects. I keep feeling unable to pull off the shot I want using the environment. There's no real good way to judge the amount of power necessary to perform a trick shot using ramps and other obstacles, besides constant failure. WHAT IS THIS, DARK SOULS!! I don't want to die a hundred times to master the aim/power mechanics of this crap.It's a nice little break from other major genres, but be ready for a world of frustration.Oh, the musical score is pretty soothing, but doesn't go well with the rage this game inflicts upon me.

												I hate people who write reviews with so little playtime. So yeah, I hate myself right now. But this game...it's painful. If I had spent money on it, I'd have hit the refund button already. Pros:-It's a golf game on PC-It worksCons:-Invert Y only works on the right stick. You'll be using the left stick for 99% of game time. Notice how it's listed as having ""full controller support""? Yeah, nah.-The script is like an AP English student read the wiki of Ayn Rand during a poop session and decided he could whip together a Unity game with some friends based around that.-WHEN YOU RESTART A HOLE, IT KEEPS YOUR PREVIOUS STROKE COUNT. Are. You. ♥♥♥♥ing. Jesting. There's a limited-use rewind mechanic, but it doesn't work very well. What is the point of a restart option if it doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing do what it says?Devs: Thanks for the free game. With improvements, it could be much better. But there are some real rookie mistakes here.

												Dislikes: The entirety of the gameLikes: NothingBut really, the main menu is a good idea but executed poorly, you walk around to what you would like to do, however there are two buildings a customization building and the golfing building. Leaving the character customization would cause my game to freak out and took several minutes to actually leave and the game would then return to normal.The menu for golfing is much better, however there are very few options to change in the options menu. This wouldn't be a bad thing if the menu was more clear on what the options did.As for gameplay (I used a controller) it isn't bad. However My camera was always very far away from the ball and i had to hold the right trigger to zoom in to the ball. The aerial view would be fine to scout out the course however it was constant. There is no button to skip to where the ball will end up so you can take your next shot, I found the ball rolling very slowly several times and this annoyed me. The things you can do in the game also don't make a lot of sense in a golf game and feel like to much or pointless.Overall the game isn't great, if you get it for free it might be worth a play, but I would not recommend buying it.

I also enjoy being a bald woman and having my balls never enter the hole, even though it says it did (No pun intended and I think the ball is shown in a crazy way when you get it in the hole).

												great graphics and runs smoothly on my i86-pxe. but sadly its hard to take the game serious when there is some luck to it, i know in real life it can be like that,but this is just a game. it kinda sucks when you plan out your shot and you miss it by an inch,strangely i used the same exact line and power and got the hole. so it just shows how it can be randomized whehter your shot goes where it needs to be. this game would be fun with friends,but cant be taken as serious. good for party game,but not good at what it promotes as a serious mini golf game.

												Beautiful and quirky olf fashioned steam-punk design aesthetic. The presentation overall is has a real charm to it and works well also. I've only played for a short while, but love everything about the game so far. The controls and user interface aren't clunky as some have stated either.  It very different from most mini-golf and golf games in general, and feels quite original as a result. This is basically golf in the Bioshock Infinite gameworld. I was lucky enough to get this for free, but would definitely have purchased, especially at the relatively low full price.			"

												There's lots to like about this game, including the steam punk setting and the ambition to try to create story and atmosphere in a mini golf game.Despite all of this I can't recommend it. In the first two rounds I played I experienced two major bugs. The physics don't feel right, with the ball feeling like it floats around the course.  The holes I played were over complex, and rather than requiring any skill, it simply felt like I needed to learn what to do so I could be better next time.  "

Early Access Review
								UPDATE! Dev has responded to pretty much everything, and discusses changing the order of the courses and adding more conventional courses and lots of other things. See it here!http://steamcommunity.com/app/272890/discussions/0/46476145268976859/I really had high hopes. People even poked fun at me for this being #3 on my wishlist but did I care? Nay. However after only 30 minutes or so I'm pretty sure I will never enjoy this game :(The whole idea of a mini-golf game in the clouds is cool until you play it. I thought it would be a creative way to simplify and at the same time provide some majesty to the background. But it's actually a mini-golf game where the ball falling OOB into oblivion is the main game mechanic. And that's sooo not fun. To make things worse, the courses are frankly all over othe place*. Most of the time you are not trying to line up shots or timing- you are studying, trying to figure out where in god's name the ball is supposed to be hit so that it may follow a wildly convoluted path towards the 'green'. God forbid you miss an approach to a ramp or escalator, you will lose many shots just tying to get back to a position where you can make the crazy shot. CONTROLLER SUPPORT is only for Xbox 360 controller, and axis and other functions on a direct-input controller don't work correctly. The DOF bothers my eyes. You cannot map any controls, and they feel ok but ""not quite right."" (sorry, thats the best way I can put it with limited played time.)But even if these things are polished to perfection, I just don't find the game fun! I think they totally missed the boat on what makes minigolf attractive. I really don't want to worry about hitting my ball into the abyss, or rebounding off a moving floor ramp that changes direction randomly, only to push the ball into the abyss, in a mini golf game. What a pain!!I WILL try to give this some more time to see if I can acquire some affection for it but, I can't recommend this based on what I have experienced so far. *I only played the first course! But it's obvious this is how the gameplay is designed. And logically the next courses are even harder, which in this case means even worse!**I basically copy pasted this from a forum post I made so it's kind of awkward as a review, and long as hell-- oh wells xD			"

												Ok, this better be one of the most stupid design decisions I've seen in my life. Imagine a mini-golf game, but instead of making smooth well-thought-out courses, you get jittery courses with unnecessary hard-to-see objects and an utter inability to get a sense of location. It's like a crash-course in user-interface mistakes.			"

												Seriously... Nobody FKN cares about your terrible voice actors. It's ♥♥♥♥ annoying, allow the option to mute it, or just remove it. The electric chair part seems like a waste of time also. and a simplified menu screen would have been fine. Only 2 clubs seems terrible, I haven't spent much time on this game but it needs a massive change, feels like i just wasted £12. not sure if there is any Customisation, didn't stick around to find out but if not, there needs to be. like ball colours and different golf clubs.Make more fun short courses and a better story mode. 2/10 bin material.

Early Access Review
								Vertiginous Golf. For anyone wondering, vertiginous is an adjective to describe something that would cause vertigo, knowing that, this games makes a little more sense. The graphics aren't all that polished, although it is still in alpha. This isn't your straight hit-the-ball-over-the-volcano types of games. This is more of a puzzle game: you need to take time to align shots. God forbid you miss an important entrance or something and wind up tossing your virtual putter around a steampunk themed putting course. This would be great for steampunk fanatics as the visuals are all steampunk. The hummingbird sound effects drove me insane, I actually disabled the audio for what little time I did end up playing. I have no patience for games like these. Excellent concept and idea, poorly executed in my opinion. Although this is in alpha, I really do hope it gets better because you can tell there was a lot of time invested in this game. But for someone like me whose looking for an easy whack-the-ball-over-the-golf course, this isn't for me. This is a puzzle game, not a mini-golf game. 3/10			"

Early Access Review
								wow, another waste of money. another game that requires an xbox controller. heres an idea. how about first making the games work with a normal keyboard and mouse since, you know, everyone has that. i bought this for local multuiplayer for me and a friend to play on the same keyboard and mouse, i know thats rare these days but i wanted to see if it would work and low and behold the main menu screen is just a spinning buggy rainstorm. i cant stop spinning around. and its wonderful that noone else seems to have the problem cause i guess EVERYONE has an xbox contoller and adapter so yea im justy a little upset i completlty wasted another 15 dollars. i work fulltime and thats still enouight to matter. maybe steam should add a refund option for games that dont work :( super sad face.

												I'm not really into golf. I stay away from them games. But this was free for 24 hours, so I installed it. Not a bad game. I was actually surprised to have enjoyed it since it had a low score in user reviews. I'm puzzled how that could have happened. So I'm leaving my positive review hoping to help bring that score back up.Don't go in expecting it to be a realistic golf game, it's far from that. It's really just a fun game. It reminds me of several mobile games like it. I didn't find the puzzles difficult at all. In fact I found easy ways around most of the obsticles anyway heh.The controls aren't bad either, I figure them out and felt confortable with them right after the first tutorial.I really liked the art style and graphics. It looks really nice and reminds me of Bioshock. Admitedly the walking part could use some improvement, mainly on the character model. But eh, I could care less about that part.			"

												This game is a perfect example of why Steam needs a netural rating.Vertiginous brings a unique art style to Golf and well designed courses but is held back by slippery physics and overall emptiness.The physics feel very icy and unpredictable I never knew where my ball was going to end up. The game would benifit a lot if it had some sort of line showing roughly where your ball will go. Instead the player is forced to gamble on weather or not their power is accurate. The game runs at a clean 60+ FPS which you would expect. It lacks a few settings for those who want the most customisation out their gameplay but delivers for lowerend machines. Not so much for any graphics card priced over around £30 as its well done art style is ruined by very low res textures. The games world is bizzarely empty for a game with presentation of its type. The art style is packed with personality but would benifit greatly from bouncy characters or some basic lore. You're thrown into this bizzare Steampunk Minigolf world with no explanation as to what is going on. You're also given the ability to customize you're poorly modeled character with limited options it means nothing unless you're in the multiplayer lobbies.This game offers fun level design and a great art style at the cost of clunky physics. £6.99 seems too much to ask for such an empty experince. I think the game is more of a £2.50 at most. Although I can't complain as I was one of the many who purchased this game for free. "

												A fun and bombastic Mini-golf game set against the backdrop of a city split, not only by class, but by altitude. I must admit, this game is more like a trajectory and timing puzzle than a true golf sim, with fans and bombs and persian rugs. But, if you love a challenge or love outlandish aesthetics, you'll get a kick out of this game. It is $10 I do not regret spending and that's all I ask for in a game.			"

												Once I finally got around to playing this a bit I could see why reviews were mixed. Some people are going to like this and even find it relaxing, like I do. But the kind of people who play things compulsively for 100% completion and try to shave seven-tenths of a second off their best run through a particular level of a game or any of that sort of thing are not going to enjoy this a bit. This is more like a game to lark around with when you have a few minutes to kill.First off, this isn't golf. It isn't even mini-golf. It's more like wacko alternate universe mini-golf. Don't expect physics. Don't expect fine-grained club control. Don't expect rationality, in fact. Just go with it.Second, don't worry about par. You're probably not going to make par a lot, no matter how often you play a hole, and it doesn't matter because you're going to get ten pounds even if you take one hundred strokes, and all you have to spend the money on is ugly golf clothes anyway.Just play it as a puzzle: How the heck do I even FINISH this hole, never mind par? Once I realized that was the outlook to take, it got pretty entertaining. I don't know if I'd play more than one round at a time - today I stopped after about fifteen holes - but I'll likely come back to it.I have no idea whether multiplayer is any good; haven't tried it. I will say that I tried to play this with both a controller and mouse+keyboard and I think controller is not the way to go here, so if you're a controller person, you might want to pass on this one.It's worth ten bucks, but I don't think I'd pay more than that.

												To recommend or not is a difficult with this game.The holes for the most part are quite good but when they start to get more complicated you will rapidly see your score climbing for no reason other than the bonkers layout, the coveyor belt dumped you in a stupid position with no line for the next jump or you just fell off the side....again. some of these holes need some serious work to make them flow better.The way you select a course to play gets boring after the first go and gets in the way of playing the game.I have no idea about the story or anything else as I just wanted to play mini golf.

												I've played for a short amount of time, but the issues are already glaring. First off, I would like to disclose that I did not actually pay for this, I got it when it was free for 24 hours.The major issue I can see is that the courses get way too complex, and sticking to par or under can be incredibly difficult or impossible. The arrows gradually become a suggestion, as you can easily get lost on the course, mainly due to the levels being built vertically, and your scout not being able to travel in 3 dimensions, only 2. Also, many of the harder holes can be weirdly easy, as going off course can make you filter past most of the course, getting you under par by what could be considered cheating.Another massive issue is that restarting a hole DOES NOT reset your strokes, pretty much making it pointless. The only reason to ever restart a hole would be so you can get past a part with less strokes, but it not resetting your strokes makes it pointless, you may as well just not care about score and just blast your way to the end, but then why really play in the first place? And why even bother going for a score when the scoring system itself is bugged? Sometimes, even if you shoot under par, you still get an above par score, so there is really no reason to play at all. The scenery also gets in the way a lot, often making you unable to see where the ball is or is going, a full top down view and see through scenery would've helped a lot.  Whilst this issue is subjective, I find its a definite problem for me, and that's that you don't know where the ball is going to go when you hit it, aside from the general direction, or if you have already hit the ball and recalled it. Along with the physics being buggy, it does not help to be blind on where the ball is going to go, or how it's going to react when it collides with a surface, and it's not fair for trial and error to be present when the game centers around taking as few strokes as possible.This game's major issue is that it wants to introduce more complex mechanics, but can't even get the basics down first, I could not imagine paying money for this as there are better minigolf games out there for free.

												If you enjoy mini golf, this is for you. If you just like challenges, this is also for you. Great controls, easy to use, and fun upgrades! It really is steam-punk styled, but don't let that chase you off from playing this game. You can easily get lost trying to get a great score (and rewinding to re-do a bad shot if your rewind bar is full) and attempting to get a hole-in-one on each level. Tons of replay value, regardless if you're a pro mini-golfer ^_^			"

												I'm not going to be the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that torpedoes some devs dreams by leaving a negative review but this game does need some work. The game isn't a complete disaster but here are some of the things that make it hard to play.First off, the ball really needs to go into the hole. I get it, when it touches the hole and pops out, it's still in the hole, but that is the most unsatisfying thing about the game. There isn't a satisfying sound effect and the ball isn't in the hole! Do a little work on that.Second, and probably most importantly, the physics are a bit... off. I'm not sure exactly what's off about them or how to fix it, but I played 9 holes and got a par, but never really had a good feel on what amount of power was needed for each shot. A shot indicator would perhaps make the game to easy, but then again, if it shows that the physics are accurate then maybe its worth it. Power and shot angles just seems wrong and it messes with then entire feel of the game.Thanks for the read and keep up the good work. Love mini golf games, just unsure about this one at this time.

Vertiginous Golf is fun to play with friends because of the sabotages you can use againts them, the design is also beautiful with each course getting more difficult than the next. I don't know why people review this game negative either they hate it or they hit the golf ball so hard they leave the Skype call, not saying any names.This game is worth every penny 10/10			"

												This game is a perfect example of why Steam needs a netural rating.Vertiginous brings a unique art style to Golf and well designed courses but is held back by slippery physics and overall emptiness.The physics feel very icy and unpredictable I never knew where my ball was going to end up. The game would benifit a lot if it had some sort of line showing roughly where your ball will go. Instead the player is forced to gamble on weather or not their power is accurate. The game runs at a clean 60+ FPS which you would expect. It lacks a few settings for those who want the most customisation out their gameplay but delivers for lowerend machines. Not so much for any graphics card priced over around £30 as its well done art style is ruined by very low res textures. The games world is bizzarely empty for a game with presentation of its type. The art style is packed with personality but would benifit greatly from bouncy characters or some basic lore. You're thrown into this bizzare Steampunk Minigolf world with no explanation as to what is going on. You're also given the ability to customize you're poorly modeled character with limited options it means nothing unless you're in the multiplayer lobbies.This game offers fun level design and a great art style at the cost of clunky physics. £6.99 seems too much to ask for such an empty experince. I think the game is more of a £2.50 at most. Although I can't complain as I was one of the many who purchased this game for free. "

												A fun and bombastic Mini-golf game set against the backdrop of a city split, not only by class, but by altitude. I must admit, this game is more like a trajectory and timing puzzle than a true golf sim, with fans and bombs and persian rugs. But, if you love a challenge or love outlandish aesthetics, you'll get a kick out of this game. It is $10 I do not regret spending and that's all I ask for in a game.			"

												This is a peculiar game. You learn that from the moment you start the game. You're looking at a rainy street, and there are no menus. You realise you can walk, and in lieu of menus are two little shops: one where you buy golf gear and hummingbirds of different patterns, and another which sells golf. You walk in, approach an unnecessarily elaborate set of screens, and select your game. The shop bids you to take a seat, and then your character sits there with a bemused smile while electrodes zap golf into his/her head. Never let it be said that this game didn't try to warn you.So then we're on the course, which you can examine by going into first-person hummingbird mode, and then see the layout ahead of you. This is a Victorian crazy golf game set in the sky, which should be no surprise to you by this point, and it soon reveals its Mouse Trap-esque arrangements of Heath Robinson-style courses to be distinctly unfair. And when I say ""distinctly unfair"", I mean it's grotesquely unfair. It's unfair to you, to me, to our ancestors, our children, and even itself. There's one that had me looking with horror from the tee of a torturously convoluted course around its immense circuit, leading to a fenced-off area just a couple of feet from the start. I teed off, sending the ball past a moving wedge onto an unexpectedly powerful conveyer belt which sent the ball almost back to the start. The aforementioned wedge pushed the ball through the fence into the final paddock, very nearly giving me a hole-in-one but letting me finish many shots under par.But that's not how it usually goes. Finishing on or under par is cause for celebration, because more often than not you'll be 4 over par, or 24 over par if something especially miserable happens. At this point, you need to know who you are. If you're a shouty controller-breaking type who even gives your own team ♥♥♥♥ on Rocket League as though that will make them play better, this isn't for you (and you're a joyless dickbag). If the weirdness detailed above sounds charmingly eccentric, and getting stuck in a version of golf seemingly designed for Sisyphus by especially cruel supply gods would make you smile at the sheer absurdity of it all, you're alright and we can be friends. In fact, we probably already are friends. There can't be many of us.TL:DR - I got this ♥♥♥♥ing thing for free, obviously. Still playing it, like.			"

												I throughly enjoy this gameWhy?For a minigold game its not one of those ""run of the mill"" minigolf games, each course has its own feeling and it isnt just a breeze to get through, you have to more or less plan out where you're going to hit the ball for the optimal scoring, yes sometime it is hardor confusing on how to get the ball to the hole but if it wasn't then where would be the fun in the game?  The fact that the courses arent linked together and are floating apart helps you concentrate on the source and not really looking around at the other courses in the backdrop. for a indy game this has some pretty good graphics.i like the fact that i have to think when playing and not just aiming a ball and then shooting like most actual golf sim games.I would gladly recommand this game to others to play. to me its well worth the 10 bucks to play and i would happily buy this game again			"

												I thought this would be crap considering the mixed reviews but after having and played it all the way, I actually found that it's fairly enjoyable - even though I've never played Golf before.The graphics are amazing on Splendid setting! But of course my lappy can't handle that or I can't bear >10fps, so had to play on the lowest and got a more reasonable and playable fps that fluctruates between 30 and 60. Still looks pretty neat even at lowest graphics settings! Music is complementary.There's a tutorial that shows you how to play the game which explains it pretty well. Though it doesn't teach everything about Golf though, so if you want that, probably find a Golf simulator game or something.....There is a story mode in this game which I found unexpectedly for a Golf game. Multiplayer: Is pretty much dead. Might get lucky if you look for a game in the US region though - I don't think ping would affect the game that much....because you know, it's Golf and there's isn't intense action you'll find, unlike in action games.....Only bugs/glitches I've come across are you might hit the ball and it will go through the boundaries somehow or I would hit the ball, and somehow it stops right at the edge of a wall or something and then next shot, the game places you outside the boundaries expecting you to somehow get the ball back in side!=============================Played on: Dell Insprion 15 3521Windows 10 Home Edition x64, 8GB RAM, every other specs are stock.

												The steampunk setting is pretty neat, the physics are fine, the game mechanics work reasonably well, and the graphics are well above average for a mini golf game. However, it's really marred by a couple of issues:1) Most of the courses are more frustrating than fun. Most shots are trick shots where missing by a few inches will quickly send you off the course, or onto the wrong level of the course. Ultimately, I found myself getting angry at the game rather than feeling like I could improve with a bit more practice.2) The story mode is a mixed bag. It's really nice that they've tried to put some story into a mini golf game, and I think the story itself is OK, but it's quite muddled and the way it's integrated into the course just makes playing the game more difficult.The multiplayer experience might be a lot better, but the single player experience is hard for me to recommend.

												Once I finally got around to playing this a bit I could see why reviews were mixed. Some people are going to like this and even find it relaxing, like I do. But the kind of people who play things compulsively for 100% completion and try to shave seven-tenths of a second off their best run through a particular level of a game or any of that sort of thing are not going to enjoy this a bit. This is more like a game to lark around with when you have a few minutes to kill.First off, this isn't golf. It isn't even mini-golf. It's more like wacko alternate universe mini-golf. Don't expect physics. Don't expect fine-grained club control. Don't expect rationality, in fact. Just go with it.Second, don't worry about par. You're probably not going to make par a lot, no matter how often you play a hole, and it doesn't matter because you're going to get ten pounds even if you take one hundred strokes, and all you have to spend the money on is ugly golf clothes anyway.Just play it as a puzzle: How the heck do I even FINISH this hole, never mind par? Once I realized that was the outlook to take, it got pretty entertaining. I don't know if I'd play more than one round at a time - today I stopped after about fifteen holes - but I'll likely come back to it.I have no idea whether multiplayer is any good; haven't tried it. I will say that I tried to play this with both a controller and mouse+keyboard and I think controller is not the way to go here, so if you're a controller person, you might want to pass on this one.It's worth ten bucks, but I don't think I'd pay more than that.

												This is a peculiar game. You learn that from the moment you start the game. You're looking at a rainy street, and there are no menus. You realise you can walk, and in lieu of menus are two little shops: one where you buy golf gear and hummingbirds of different patterns, and another which sells golf. You walk in, approach an unnecessarily elaborate set of screens, and select your game. The shop bids you to take a seat, and then your character sits there with a bemused smile while electrodes zap golf into his/her head. Never let it be said that this game didn't try to warn you.So then we're on the course, which you can examine by going into first-person hummingbird mode, and then see the layout ahead of you. This is a Victorian crazy golf game set in the sky, which should be no surprise to you by this point, and it soon reveals its Mouse Trap-esque arrangements of Heath Robinson-style courses to be distinctly unfair. And when I say ""distinctly unfair"", I mean it's grotesquely unfair. It's unfair to you, to me, to our ancestors, our children, and even itself. There's one that had me looking with horror from the tee of a torturously convoluted course around its immense circuit, leading to a fenced-off area just a couple of feet from the start. I teed off, sending the ball past a moving wedge onto an unexpectedly powerful conveyer belt which sent the ball almost back to the start. The aforementioned wedge pushed the ball through the fence into the final paddock, very nearly giving me a hole-in-one but letting me finish many shots under par.But that's not how it usually goes. Finishing on or under par is cause for celebration, because more often than not you'll be 4 over par, or 24 over par if something especially miserable happens. At this point, you need to know who you are. If you're a shouty controller-breaking type who even gives your own team ♥♥♥♥ on Rocket League as though that will make them play better, this isn't for you (and you're a joyless dickbag). If the weirdness detailed above sounds charmingly eccentric, and getting stuck in a version of golf seemingly designed for Sisyphus by especially cruel supply gods would make you smile at the sheer absurdity of it all, you're alright and we can be friends. In fact, we probably already are friends. There can't be many of us.TL:DR - I got this ♥♥♥♥ing thing for free, obviously. Still playing it, like.			"

What else you expect?I am not that a big fan of golf but this game is remarkably done. The only thing keeping me from giving out a whole 5 on 5 stars is the fact that the background music itself is awesome, but it also is very repetitive. Different tracks of the same kind and it gets straight away my 5 stars! For a chilling and easy time this game goes a long way.Defenetly have to try it for those who want ""to golf on"" !!			"

												I throughly enjoy this gameWhy?For a minigold game its not one of those ""run of the mill"" minigolf games, each course has its own feeling and it isnt just a breeze to get through, you have to more or less plan out where you're going to hit the ball for the optimal scoring, yes sometime it is hardor confusing on how to get the ball to the hole but if it wasn't then where would be the fun in the game?  The fact that the courses arent linked together and are floating apart helps you concentrate on the source and not really looking around at the other courses in the backdrop. for a indy game this has some pretty good graphics.i like the fact that i have to think when playing and not just aiming a ball and then shooting like most actual golf sim games.I would gladly recommand this game to others to play. to me its well worth the 10 bucks to play and i would happily buy this game again			"

												I thought this would be crap considering the mixed reviews but after having and played it all the way, I actually found that it's fairly enjoyable - even though I've never played Golf before.The graphics are amazing on Splendid setting! But of course my lappy can't handle that or I can't bear >10fps, so had to play on the lowest and got a more reasonable and playable fps that fluctruates between 30 and 60. Still looks pretty neat even at lowest graphics settings! Music is complementary.There's a tutorial that shows you how to play the game which explains it pretty well. Though it doesn't teach everything about Golf though, so if you want that, probably find a Golf simulator game or something.....There is a story mode in this game which I found unexpectedly for a Golf game. Multiplayer: Is pretty much dead. Might get lucky if you look for a game in the US region though - I don't think ping would affect the game that much....because you know, it's Golf and there's isn't intense action you'll find, unlike in action games.....Only bugs/glitches I've come across are you might hit the ball and it will go through the boundaries somehow or I would hit the ball, and somehow it stops right at the edge of a wall or something and then next shot, the game places you outside the boundaries expecting you to somehow get the ball back in side!=============================Played on: Dell Insprion 15 3521Windows 10 Home Edition x64, 8GB RAM, every other specs are stock.

												First impressions: Vertiginous Gold is a rather interesting minigolf game complete with a story mode that tells a tale of a dystopian, steampunk-esque world. The courses are interesting, often incorporating multiple elements like conveyor belts, fans, and teleport pipes that influence where the ball will go. If you don't like leaving things to chance, you even have a limited ability to influence the ball while it's rolling, in order to tweak its course or steer around obstacles.Sadly the game feels encumbered by a frustrating control scheme. In particular, when using a controller it's very easy to take an unintended shot. To undo a shot requires energy and more of it the further the ball travels, so that if the ball's travelled far enough you can no longer ""rewind"" the shot at all. If you think your shot will fail you have to hit the correct button as quickly as possible. You can restart the hole, but this only sends your ball back to the start position, while keeping your score. Much like real golf, the only options for dealing with a disastrous score is to play it through to the end, or abandon the entire round.Now I don't mind having to accept the consequences of my own mistakes - that is, after all, a fundamental part of gaming - but the frustration that occurs when you're in the middle of adjusting the strength of your putt and the game decides that you actually want to hit the ball right NOW is what puts me off.

												To recommend or not is a difficult with this game.The holes for the most part are quite good but when they start to get more complicated you will rapidly see your score climbing for no reason other than the bonkers layout, the coveyor belt dumped you in a stupid position with no line for the next jump or you just fell off the side....again. some of these holes need some serious work to make them flow better.The way you select a course to play gets boring after the first go and gets in the way of playing the game.I have no idea about the story or anything else as I just wanted to play mini golf.

												I've played for a short amount of time, but the issues are already glaring. First off, I would like to disclose that I did not actually pay for this, I got it when it was free for 24 hours.The major issue I can see is that the courses get way too complex, and sticking to par or under can be incredibly difficult or impossible. The arrows gradually become a suggestion, as you can easily get lost on the course, mainly due to the levels being built vertically, and your scout not being able to travel in 3 dimensions, only 2. Also, many of the harder holes can be weirdly easy, as going off course can make you filter past most of the course, getting you under par by what could be considered cheating.Another massive issue is that restarting a hole DOES NOT reset your strokes, pretty much making it pointless. The only reason to ever restart a hole would be so you can get past a part with less strokes, but it not resetting your strokes makes it pointless, you may as well just not care about score and just blast your way to the end, but then why really play in the first place? And why even bother going for a score when the scoring system itself is bugged? Sometimes, even if you shoot under par, you still get an above par score, so there is really no reason to play at all. The scenery also gets in the way a lot, often making you unable to see where the ball is or is going, a full top down view and see through scenery would've helped a lot.  Whilst this issue is subjective, I find its a definite problem for me, and that's that you don't know where the ball is going to go when you hit it, aside from the general direction, or if you have already hit the ball and recalled it. Along with the physics being buggy, it does not help to be blind on where the ball is going to go, or how it's going to react when it collides with a surface, and it's not fair for trial and error to be present when the game centers around taking as few strokes as possible.This game's major issue is that it wants to introduce more complex mechanics, but can't even get the basics down first, I could not imagine paying money for this as there are better minigolf games out there for free.

												Oh boy, Vertiginous Golf! Where do I even begin with this? I saw TieTuesday's archived stream of this game, and I was interested as a result. i only recently remembered, and I'm glad I did.The premise is simple: miniature golf in the sky. You have a special rewind function and a small engine to help push the ball in a certain direction. These both cost fuel, which replenishes as the ball moves. It's a fairly simple game with extra mechanics that aren't really hard to learn.The story is... certainly something. I'd have not expected a golf game to have some deep lore to it, but here we are. I'm not sure what else I can say about it outside of what's in the pitch that I could reveal without maor spoilers, so I'll leave this point at that.As for the atmosphere, it's amazing. Each course is beautifully animated, as is the hub world. The sounds are also a fitting inclusion, and the music really fits the mood when it kicks in.Moving onto the playability. I felt the controls were quite smooth, and the game was working well, from what I've seen. It's not so engaging in the single player mode, but if you can play this with some friends, it'll more than make up for that experience.So, all of that being said, what are my final thoughts? At the time of writing this, I haven't put too much time into this game, but with my current experiences with it, I can see myself sinking much more into it. If you're looking into a single player experience and don't absolutely love golf that much, I'd not suggest this (at full price, at least), but otherwise, it's totally worth it. Give it a shot, see how it goes.			"

												The courses are cool and look beautiful, but the lobby/shop/course selection is clunky and bleh. Sadly I doubt extra polish is on the way at this point. Still, it's good fun, difficult, and has multiplayer. What more can you ask for from mini golf?			"

												I love this game. No sarcasm. I've played this game with a few of my friends, and I honestly love it. Community maps are the best, although I feel that there is a lack of officially made courses.Overall, I'd wait for it to get on sale, and play it with a couple friends. It's great.			"

												Too much fun. Buggy, but it has charm for it. Almost never had as much fun doing local co-op with a friend.			"
