												Put a quarter into the arcade machine and play this one. Ignore the cheesy chip tune (or turn it off in the options), ignore the shooter game it starts with, because in a sudden twist you'll find yourself in a platformer with a teleport gun that handles arcade style: no blue and orange portals, just straight up teleports and precision jumps that let you reach where you want to reach, provided you can figure out and make the jumps.Don't pass this one by while it's on sale.

												Ok, let's be honest: I bought this game for 0,19€ and thought it would be 'okay' for a couple of minutes, I'd grab the cards and then it would disappear in the library, never to be looked at again. After the first 20 minutes I had to admit that the game is quite entertaining and after seeing the ending I didn't even notice that I've played it for over an hour. Sure the (retro-style) pixel graphics and the 16-bit sound seem to be standard for every second indie game, but in 'Out There Somewhere' they do their job quite good, they made me feel a bit nostalgic and are very charming (I really like this music in the main menu). The portal gun and the different puzzles are well done and I seriously had to think sometimes how to solve this room. Green, red and blue light beams, jumping, momentum - there are several things to consider when shooting that little bullet. Yeah it is a short game with a short 'story' (the bad guy shoots at me, my ship crashes and I have to explore the planet to finally kill the bad guy. All of this because of... reasons!) and a length of approximately one hour for the first playthrough. However during this short period I've been entertained well and it never felt repetitive. In addition there are many interesting achievements that bring in some replay value, so I'd say it's definitly worth this small price and I have to admit: Developers, you've done a really nice job!

												Let me start by saying that I bought this with 96% discount for 19c. The title grabbed my attention, and so I just had to try it. What else could I buy for 19 cents anyway? I can't think of many other things, and certainly not something that could keep me entertained for several hours like this little gem did.What is it about?Out there somewhere is a short 2D puzzle-platformer with a few simple but interesting mechanics. For me personally, it feels like a mash-up of Portal, The Swapper and You Have to Win the Game, which is a good thing because I like all of those games.You take a role of Yuri - the space cop, who tries to protect the mothership from a bad guy Grigori. Your ship was shot down and crashed on an unknown planet. Now you have to find missing parts, repair your shuttle and face Gregori once again…GameplayAlthough the very first segment of the game is a classic arcade-machine-style space shooter, don't be fooled. The whole gameplay is based on jumping around with teleportation gun, solving puzzles. How it works is, you fire ""teleshots"" and you are instantly teleported the moment they hit the surface. Your telegun also stores your momentum, which is another important little mechanic to keep in mind. There are obviously different surfaces, obstacles and problems throughout the levels, and it's all up to you to solve.Later in game, you'll get a pew pew gun to deal with enemies if you so desire, but you can very well just avoid most of them...SidenotesPuzzles are challenging but fun. There are plenty of checkpoints, so even if you die, it's not a major setback most of the time.Even though the visual style is simple, I really dig the concept art and the cutscenes, as well as chiptune soundtrack - it's surprisingly not as monotonous and annoying as I thought it would be. I think it all works well with the space theme, too. Not to forget, there are even some funny little easter eggs and references here and there, and I'm always a big fan of those.Like I mentioned before, this game is short. Even taking it reaaally slow and casual, it took me only 3 hours to beat. You could very possibly manage to do your first playthrough in 90 minutes. There's even achievement for finishing the game in under 20 minutes… There's some replayability thanks to Steam achievements, but even then, you shouldn't expect endless hours of fun. On the other hand - it's a very simple game in terms of game mechanics, and it could get boring and repetitive if it took too long. I guess it depends on how you look at it. I would say it's reasonable for what it is.ConclusionWhat can I say, it's a nice little game. It requires thinking and quick reactions, and thanks to that, it can be pretty challenging. It's a kind of one-trick-pony, but well executed IMHO. I know some people might feel it's too short for the full price, but I definitely do recommend it when it's in sale.			"

												Bought it for 17 cents during the summer sale, and out of all the games I bought (Garry's Mod,  etc.) this was still my favorite. Very platform-y, and not only has great music but also great visuals. Would higly reccomend to anyone. Best 17 cents of my life.			"

												Out There Somewhere is an aesthetically pleasing puzzle platformer that makes use of teleporting and various environmental obstacles. The art and gameplay are both well done, and it is a nice treat. The mechanics of the game are easy to pick up and there is an even balance between execution and solution in the puzzles (in other words, it takes some thinking as well as fast fingers). Not to be confused with a portal gun (where you make two doors and enter freely), when you fire your telegun you are teleported when your projectile hits a solid surface. There are obstacles (crumbling surfaces, mirrors, glass, some beams, and enemies) that are thrown into the mix to keep things interesting. The controls all feel solid, and, given the length, the game was fair in challenge and pacing.There is very little combat (most enemies can be avoided) and there are 3 boss fights (1 being a repeat). That being said, unless you get health upgrades, there can be some challenge in avoiding everything or killing everything. The main game is rather short if you are focused on just beating the game (my first run with very little exploration clocked in just over an hour), however I highly recommend you take the time to explore and find all the upgrades: these areas are some of the more challenging of the game. The story and dialogue feel underdeveloped, and overall I was left wanting more of the game in general, but I do not consider this a bad thing.Out There Somewhere is light on combat and easy on your backlog, but those looking for a clever puzzle platformer should check it out.

 About Out There Somewhere Game starts off as a shoot'em up side-scroller, which really took me by surprise. I mean, judging by the screens you'd rather expect a puzzle platformer and you get that not so long after the game starts, too. And then it just hit me, the brilliance of the idea: you fly, fighting your way to a new planet. Then you land, 'meet the locals' and proceed with the featured mission, which involves solving puzzles, fighting your way forward and doing some cool oldschool platformer type trickjumps. It's just all there. Again, really awesome mix. Gameplay	The puzzle part is rather fun, the puzzles are not terribly easy, but also not too complicated. Can't imagine spending 8 minutes trying to beat one though (one of the achievements). As the game progresses, different beams are implemented, which change the behaviour of your teleport gun. The variety of enemies is rather limited - 4 kinds, erasing them is a bit of a chore, spam your gun until they drop dead. The game could feature no enemies and no one would probably miss them. The NPCs remind me the ones in old NES games, like Duck Tales, sometimes you have to sweat a little to get to them, but they might have some useful information or will say some funny things.The shoot'em up part is just there I guess. It covers approx. 5% of a game that lasts for an hour, so you don't really spend too much time in it, shame.Graphic	It's mostly just your basic 'oldschool-nes-like-game-graphics'. Anyway, the art style is pleasant to watch. The only thing that somehow buggered me was that some maps looked a bit mundane and dull, with only same bricks of terrain laid over another same bricks of terrain. Adding more background details and decorations would probably make the game look a bit nicer, but then again, it's not really about the graphics this time, is it?All in All Out There Somewhere is a really good Indie Game!8/10 From MeSweep 	 "

Basic InformationTitle:  Out There SomewhereDeveloper:  MiniBossPublisher:  EQ-Games, MiniBossGenre:  Classic style platformerGeneral ImpressionOut There Somewhere is a 2D platformer that emulates the classic side-scrolling action of older titles while offering a breath of fresh air in the almost entire absence of platforming sections.  The story is all about a stranded astronaut trying to survive. Quite odd for a platformer is the lack of many enemies as well. You will mostly teleport here and there with ocassional text based dialogue pop-ups. This is definitely more an experience about exploration than combat and avoiding obstacles. Even if the game is rather short it felt a bit boring at times. It features simple graphics and sounds but for its price point and considering the inclusion of Cards and Achievements, the game is ultimately worth trying out.Strong Points+ Plenty of collectibles.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points-  Unbalanced difficulty.- Too short.Rating 6/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

												I've never seen this mechanic before, it's very fun and gives some interesting puzzle platforming. And it is well explored in the level design. I love the visuals too. Quality pixel art, very cute. The game is mostly on the easy side. I figured out the mechanics quickly and at worst I died 3 to 4 times on the hardest rooms. The bullet hell sections, however, are pretty hard! at least to me, I hate bullethell games. It is a very small part of the game, but it makes me wonder about mixing such completely different genres. Here it didn't take anything from the game but I remember feeling quite disappointed with Brutal Legends, for example, because I went in expecting to play an action fighting game in an open world and found myself playing an RTS. I don't like RTS so I couldn't enjoy the game, no matter how good it is. But I digress. This is not an issue with Out There Somewhere, the spaceship sessions are short and few.It's extremely short though. But without considering price, length is not a very useful information. What I mean by that is I think the game is worth what they are asking for it. It's a short adorable, original and fun little game and it's cheaper than a sandwich. I'm a very satisfied custommer.

												Out There Somewhere is a nice platformer where you initially drive a spaceship, then you explore a planet full of weird aliens, and finally you get into your spaceship again for the final confrontation.You can beat the game in well under two hours, and as far as I can tell there is not much replay value (unless you want to collect the several achievements that Steam lets you collect). I recommend this game as long as you buy it at a discount, since it's a very short game. However, it is well done, it sometimes requires some reasoning to travel through certain screens, there are several secret screens and collectables thrughout the game, and its aesthetics is overall nice.Plus: it's chocked full of sci-fi (mostly Star Trek, but not only that) references, which is always good!

Note: video review embedded below.There’s something untraditionally appealing about Out There Somewhere’s insubstantiality. It’s a very brief, straightforward experience, but rather than feeling shallow it uses its brevity to subvert the players expectations in interesting ways.That arcade shooting segment at the start? That’s just a prelude to the platformer that takes up most of the game. That gun you’re carrying? It’s actually for teleporting you around instead of killing enemies. The huge world the game seems to be hinting at? In reality it’s a more classical one direction platformer. Out There Somewhere is full of little touches that seemed designed to throw you off course and surprise you with how things play out. They may come at the cost of making a lasting impression, but I feel like that wasn’t ever its prerogative.Out There Somewhere also gets away with a lot more than most games could because of how strong its mechanics are, and how intrinsically they’re tied to level designs. The teleporter gun is largely your only tool throughout the game, and each screen is made to perfectly utilize it for platforming and puzzle solving (provided your reflexes are up for it). Eventually I was having to take into account bullet speed, character momentum, and environmental devices in order to navigate effectively. These additions are added quickly, but also scale the difficulty smoothly enough to where I almost didn’t realize how much more involved later levels were because the game had taught me how to play so well.One could argue that Out There Somewhere is too short or simple or loose, and they wouldn’t be entirely wrong. The game often feels as if it’s holding on by a thread and some frustrating moments can be a lot more unpleasant due to how much of the overall game they encompass. But its length and careful scope feel so intentional and considered that I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and enjoy how it played with my expectations. I might not remember it a year or even a month from now, but as a condensed experiment in teleportation and unconventional design I don’t regret the journey.

Short story, unusal game mechanics, pretty good soundtrack. But I don't know, there is something wrong with jumping... Sometimes you just can't jump again after using a teleporter and it's really annoying. Actually this game is about teleporting and reaching new grounds. "

												Out there somewhere is a nice platformer with a decent ""old-school"" feel -- it's not a strained and missed attempt to cash in on nostalgia for ""retro"" games; quite the opposite it feels and looks solid like all the parts belong where they are. The platforming can be pretty challenging at times due to the addition of a teleport gun gimmick that teleports the character to wherever the bullet lands. Add in conservation of momentum across teleports, ability to shoot multiple tele-bullets at a time, and special beams of light and you get some neat platforming! Akin to old platformers the game world has its share of secret rooms and hidden bonuses that await the daring explorer. Also monsters and other baddies, a big bad boss, and two space shmup sections! Overall a pretty short experience -- around 1 hour for a casual experience, or under 20 mins for a speed run -- but between the secrets and a speedrunning challenge there's enough to warrant an extra play or two.

												I have to say, this may verry well be the best $.49 I have ever spentPros-Amazing teleport mechanic-Good difficulty curve-Great Music-Treeman-Overall gameplay is greatCons-It's short-Bats-somewhat annoying combat systemBartle TaxonomyKillers: Not the best game for these guys. You only get one gun, and it's not that powerfull. Not the best game for this type of player.Achievers: Many achivements and ingame collectables to get. A great game for this type of player.Socialisers: There is some interaction with aliens, but not a whole lot. Most aliens only have one line. There won't be much of any replay value for this type of player, but for the first time through it will be decent.Explorers: Explorers should have a great time with this game. When playing through it, I often saw places I couldn't reach from my current position and thought ""How can I get over there?"" There are many hidden places to find. This type of player will have a great time with this game.Score:7/10Make the combat less annoying, have more interaction with aliens, and make the game a bit longer. These are the only complaints I have about this game. However, for it's price, I highly recomend this game.			"

												A nice little game, I got a copy early but never actually got around to playing it so I figured I'd do that now.What is it?Well it's basically a semi-portal metroidvania. You have a teleport gun that moves you to where it shoots, with it carrying over momentum so when you jump it keeps your speed. That being the core mechanic of the game it does it very well. You have to utilise you teleport gun along with various world objects to get around.Is it something I like? No, it's really not my style of game.Is it something I'd recommend? Definitely, it is a very solid platformer with an emphasis on timing. Don't let the chep price fool you, it's certainly worth a lot more than they are charging.			"

												A fun, charming and creative puzzle platformer. It pushes the creativity of its teleporting mechanic very far. Only lasted about an hour but it was really enjoyable.This game is a bit challenging and forces you to think about what you're doing. One thing I loved was that failing a level didn't have a lengthy game over screen, or a splash. It would throw you right back in which kept the action up. And even if was only 3 or 4 enemies I also liked that the game had some combat. I'd love to see the idea expanded. I think there's a lot of hidden depth in the teleporting mechanic that the developers didn't exploit this time around. This is a  great game that's worth a try.			"

Then one day I fired it up, saw it was a terrible side-scrolling space shooter, and uninstalled it.Except...that is a fake-out, as anyone who has played for more than a few minutes knows, and once that is finished you get to play through a brisk but still roundly enjoyable (and adorable) kind of simple platformer-meets-Portal.  Well, teleporting, not portals, but it certainly calls that to mind.The pixel art is gorgeous, the soundtrack matches perfectly, and it will probably make you feel smart when you figure out some of the trickier puzzles.  Totally worth 19¢.  I daresay I would pay upwards of DOLLARS for it!			"

												After beating the game several times, I gotta say I feel bad I got this when it was on -96% sale.This was a surpisingly good indie game to me. I didn't know what to expect before installing it but since I saw from some other reviews that the game was short I decided to give it a chance. I'm glad I did.The game is a conventional 2D exploration platformer for the asthetics, but combines it with some Portal mechanics and specially with the Cave Story gameplay style. The game takes place into an uncharted dark world that together with the main character look-a-like give that final Limbo taste. So actually the devs' description about the game is accurate enough.You accidentally land into this planet so the goal is basically finding a way to repair it and get rid of the people who chased you. A very soft story but heh, aside from Ori and the Blind Forest, no one expects a deep storymode from a 2D platformer, do they?Graphics are cute and satisfying to my eyes. Even though the world is constantly dark, you feel pretty immersed in it soon enough. Also, the few places where the story take place are quite varied so you don't feel you're just stepping into the same thing over and over. Music is surprisingly catchy. I've always liked chiptune/8bit/16bit music and this game catches the point. Damn, this game is worthy just for that, guys!Gameplay is perfect as usual in 2D platformers. Tight and fair, every death will be at your own fault. The physics of the portal gun, the jumps, the movement and those devices that works with the gun respond as they should.As an exploration game, the game is rewarding. I didn't care to play this game 4 times, and between them I just discovered new things, which was charming considering how short the game is. The map is pretty well developed and I can only critisize the fact that to get full map exploration you need to avoid some checkpoints until you get the laser gun so you can die and restart from start point with it.Puzzles are fair and not frustrating. I'm usually super derp with these games since I usually think answers too much and never reach the end, uninstalling the game eventually. But this one felt the right way. Puzzles were easy enough for me, but still give you that feeling of ""Oh! Now I see it"". Overall, I'm happy I made priority with this game over many from my library. Even at full price, the game will give you entertainment and joy. Devs certainly deserved more than 19 cts!Final Mark: 7.5/10			"

												TL;DR - I know my play time looks insane. You will assuredly not get 190 hours of this game, but you will get 2 of the most fun hours you've had gaming in a while. Buy now!As my first foray into speedrunning, this game has given me several dozen hours of entertainment beyond what would be expected by reasonable gamers. But I am trying to be unbiased, and think of this game from a casual standpoint.I still recommend it glowingly.A quirky 2D platformer with a laser-sharp, utilitarian design approach, Out There Somewhere gives you a light dash of shooting combat, a gentle hint of exploration, and a core game built around puzzle-platforming with a 2D teleport gun. It is bookended by space shooter segments that some reviewers have taken issue with - I won't argue with them for finding these segments disjunct, but I still enjoy them anyway.It is worth noting that the pace at which new mechanics are introduced is absolutely stellar - far better than many A-list titles. You get a sense for what each button does, a scenario or two that changes your approach, and then a wholly new element just as you are getting comfortable.It seems like the biggest complaint from most reviewers is the game's short length. Most people should have an easy time earning the ""Swift Success"" achievement on their first play, it's true, but the collectibles should keep completionists occupied for another hour or so after - they even require a little meta-gaming! At a two dollar price point, this is plenty of game for your buck, and it's not often that this caliber of level design, soundtrack, and art style find their way into a two-dollar title.			"

												This is a competent retro 8-bit platformer. But wait! What makes this particular game interesting is the teleport gun: you fire the gun, and you teleport to the point of impact. The developer makes good use of this fact for a variety of puzzles, spiced up by the fact momentum is maintained through the teleport, plus vertical light beams that have different effects on your projectile. There's also a more traditional gun, although to be honest the combat never really felt necessary, apart from a couple of puzzles. It's not that difficult to figure out a way through each room, and in fact there are occasionally different ways of doing so; the difficulty lies in the execution, but thankfully it's not that frustrating.It doesn't last very long, 90 minutes at the most, but I paid $0.19 or something so I'm hardly likely to complain. Nice traditional chiptune music, appealing 8-bit graphics, some secrets to find, and even a space shooter minigame, overall it's worthwhile if you like a bit of puzzling in your 8-bit platforming.

												Holy ♥♥♥♥. When I initially saw this game on the store for 25 cents I wasn't sure if a game this cheap would be worth it. However upon downloading and booting up this game I was instantly met with waves of energy and joy. From when I hit ""new game"" I knew I was in for a ride, and what a ride that was. The music controlled the gameplay almost more than I did, forcing me in and out of situations that would seem impossible with the very sound of a note. The ""portal gun"", as one could call it, adds a new depth to the platforming which makes it fun, puzzling, and at some points infuriating. Out There Somewhere is like nothing I have played before, or as I should say, many things I have played before. The developers took Cave Story, Portal, Metroid, and VVVVVV and spat out one of the best indie games I have played in the past few years. I recommend this game to everyone who loves difficulty (while still beign fair), a simple yet entertaining narrative, and just some sweet bumpin' tunes. So what do you have to lose? With a full price of 4.99 and a sale orice of 0.25 (canadian), this game is a steal. I give it a solid 9.5/10			"

It was so fun and enjoyable figuring out how to get to the other side.- smart and thoughtful level design.- it has a game of thrones reference.- perfect length, not the ""are you serious?! Is this the end of it??"" short, and not the "" finally i finished this game i was getting bored "" long, it was just perfect.- it Costs 4 SR ( $1 ?), it should be more.- good soundtrack. Really good.- damn grigori is still ...looking forward to your future work.			"

												Low-res puzzle platformers are almost literally a dime a dozen now but Out There Somewhere manages to stand apart by being polished and clever with its core mechanic. That mechanic is a teleport gun, which fires a bullet that teleports you to its point of impact. The teleport preserves your momentum as well, so if you start a jump right before you warp, you can essentially tele-walljump. Several puzzles make use of this and other neat physics tricks you can do with yourself, gradually nudging the difficulty up in a pleasant, inviting way that has you feeling clever and masterful by the end of the game. There's a little combat with enemies and a few secrets to hunt if you are so inclined, but it's a very short and sweet package... one playthrough will last you less than an hour. I certainly wish it was longer because it is very tight and fun for those 45 minutes, but what's there is more than worth playing. There's even some inklings of plot and some interaction with aliens as you traverse the odd little world, and neat opening and closing sequences that play like Gradius-style shooters. And if you really feel like sticking with it, there are a mess of oddly-grindy achievements to shoot for, though I wouldn't encourage it. Overall a great little experience for even the most jaded puzzle platformer player.			"

												Although the story is not something that will take hours to go through, this game is worth the price. It is a kind of game that you will replay—it has achievements that you likely cannot get in just a few playthroughs. There are hidden easter eggs to be found as well. The soundtrack is fun and the graphics are rather nice too. I've played through the story once and know I will several more times as well, for I still have things to find and achievements to get. This is a pretty good platformer + puzzle game.			"

												SPOILERS AHEAD! In a sense this is actually 2 games, so I will talk about them separately. The shmup section was short but sweet, I am terrible at these kinds of games but I enjoyed it. My only issue is that your gun won't fire at full speed if you hold down the button, requiring you to mash for the most damage potential. I died as soon as the boss shot his laser, and though I'd need to restart until...The puzzle-platforming section, which is the meat of the game. Crashing on the planet and needing to find ship parts (conveniently the same model as the shmup upgrades) reminded me of Knytt (in a good way), and so did the slower pace and early lack of combat. Puzzle progress felt steady and fun, though the ""double shot"" puzzle I managed to solve without learning the proper trick, stunting my progress in the next few rooms. I really enjoyed having a ""teleport"" gun instead of a ""portal"" gun, which felt very fresh as a mechanic. Combat was passable, with notable frustration trying to hit the flying bats, and not knowing how long the boss would take to defeat. The biggest issue I had was with NPC conversations, ending the conversation would not close the text box right away and another press would start it again; extremely frustrating.Going back to shmup at the end was unexpected and exciting, and I didn't die to the laser! I was a bit sad that it ended, but that title call-out was a great wrap up to the story. The art and sound were excellent throughout, with a special mention to alien NPC designs.			"

												Short, but enjoyable.I beat ""Somewhere Out There"" in about an hours time, but by no means to completion. Despite this, I whole heartedly recommend this game. It's a clever little puzzle platformer that harkens back to some of the classics in the genre. The story, while short, is interesting and the music is memorable and entertaining to listen to.My only real beef is with the very plain graphics. The character sprites and the portraits are so nice, I wish that the backgrounds had some of the same attention given to them. The game just looks plain. Take a look at a game like Rex Rocket for an example of how beautiful a game like this can be. Fortunately, ""Out There Somewhere"" is saved by it's fantastic platforming, which is really all that matters anyway.			"

												Just finished the game, fun but way too short let's get into the pros and cons.Pros:- Really fun- Good dialogue here and there on the planet - Music is really 8-bit let's get it on!- Graphics are cool- The mechanics are fun and somewhat original- Frustrating puzzles...Cons:- FRUSTRATING PUZZLES. (jesus I love them but i hate them at the same time......)- Too short, way too short..- What makes the game take long are the puzzles and the time you get stuck in them but if you are quick to do them it's too short.- Space battle is just 1/5 of the game, it could have more space battle in order to make the game a bit longer as wellOverall:Fun game, good art, good music, good mechanics. All in all I recommend it's a fun game to pass some time tho it is a bit short it is still fun and still worth the money.Score:8/10			"

												Definitely feels like cave story so far - looks good,. worth 19 cents even without the trading cards. Possibly more. Worth getting while the special promotion is up and running,.Too early for me to tell if the whole game is worth 5$ or more, but it's looking good so far.edit1: A bit further into the game, it will get harder, but not by so much that you'll bash your head on the keyboard. Some of the puzzles can even be ""cheated"" by completing them with a bit of clever jumping to avoid the way they were ""intended to be solved"".Some reviews will claim it's about 90 minutes worth of gameplay,. and at the speed that these puzzles are getting solved I'd say that seems about right. Still 19 cents for an hour of something new is good,. but I wouldn't pay 5$ for it. So, get it while it's on discount, or in the next humble bundle.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a 2D platformer with simple puzzle elements. Your mission is take out Grigor, but in the battle your ship was damaged and you crash land on an unknown planet. You have to find him on the planet and take him out for good. This is mostly done by platforming. The main mechanic to get used to is the use of a portal gun. You shoot it and when the projectile hits a solid target you will be teleported to that spot. You'll learn the ins and outs of how that works, along with interacting with different beams and other obstacles that will change the way your teleportation works. There's also a gun you can use as a weapon to fight off the planet's hostile inhabitants. This gun doesn't shoot very rapidly and it's a small bullet, but this only makes it all the more useful as you need to aim carefully and plan your shots. It's simple to grasp but will test your smarts and skills as you try to get the hidden upgrades. The graphics are pixelated and dark. The visuals, along with some cool synth music, make for a nice atmosphere to travel through. There's not a whole lot more to say. Not much story, just some simple mechanics and areas to clear. It's a nice little game.There are some problems, though. All of them seem to stem from the game's legnth. It'll probably only take you 1-2 hours to beat it, and not much more for achievement hunters. That's fine story-wise, as there's not much there outside the premise. However, it seems like more could've been done with the mechanics that were set in place. More puzzles, more ideas with the mechanics, and just some more outside the box thinking. Having a longer game would also mean a larger world, with perhaps more items and powerups to collect. More bosses would've been good. There are two space shooting sections, but having more would've been nice as well. It's neat that those sections start and end the game to kind of tie it up in a nice little bow, but having more of them might make the playstyle feel a little more welcome. A map would've been nice too.Overall, this is a lighter recommendation. The game is nice with simple mechanics and intresting atmosphere, but it's rather short and could use some fleshing out. Perhaps there will be another game by the developers in a similar fashion, or maybe even a sequel to expand upon these ideas, which have a lot of potential. What's here is good, and only taking a while to beat isn't bad, but this game FEELS short. It feels like this style of game should have more to it. It's no Super Metroid, it's no Cave Story, but it's something neat that, if on sale, if worth checking out. Five dollars is a little steep for a Steam game like this, but if you can get it for a few bucks or less, consider it. Out There Somewhere gets a 6 out of 10 for being a neat little adventure that has lots of potential and a satisfying, even if short, experience.			"

Warning: May Contains SpoilersTwo words: wasted potential!I have just finished playing Out There Somewhere and it was a really pleasant experience. However, it was a very SHORT experience indeed.Anyway, let me break it down to details and grade every aspect on its own.ConceptGame starts off as a shoot'em up side-scroller, which really took me by surprise. I mean, judging by the screens you'd rather expect a puzzle platformer and you get that not so long after the game starts, too. And then it just hit me, the brilliance of the idea: you fly, fighting your way to a new planet. Then you land, 'meet the locals' and proceed with the featured mission, which involves solving puzzles, fighting your way forward and doing some cool oldschool platformer type trickjumps. It's just all there. Again, really awesome mix.StoryNot much to say really. No history, no explanations, no nothing. Just fix your ship and welp, you're done. I mean, I didn't really expect to have a Witcher 3 in space, but for the sake of having the player become involved in the game, it really needs something. Tell me a story of a war, rebellion maybe, invasion, whatever, but please share some details with us, not just generic 'Humanity almost extinct, Grigori attacks, protect planet' stuff. I wouldn't even need any cut scenes, just some text scrolling up with a nice background, skippable for those who don't care about such aspects of the game.GraphicsIt's mostly just your basic 'oldschool-nes-like-game-graphics'. Anyway, the art style is pleasant to watch. The only thing that somehow buggered me was that some maps looked a bit mundane and dull, with only same bricks of terrain laid over another same bricks of terrain. Adding more background details and decorations would probably make the game look a bit nicer, but then again, it's not really about the graphics this time, is it?MusicSimple, yet quite atmospheric. It reminds me of the soundtrack of Risk of Rain that is electronic sounds that just really fit the space exploration theme of the game. The musical themes change when you change a map/biome and pretty much all of them are really enjoyable.GameplayThe puzzle part is rather fun, the puzzles are not terribly easy, but also not too complicated. Can't imagine spending 8 minutes trying to beat one though (one of the achievements). As the game progresses, different beams are implemented, which change the behaviour of your teleport gun. The variety of enemies is rather limited - 4 kinds, erasing them is a bit of a chore, spam your gun until they drop dead. The game could feature no enemies and no one would probably miss them. The NPCs remind me the ones in old NES games, like Duck Tales, sometimes you have to sweat a little to get to them, but they might have some useful information or will say some funny things.The shoot'em up part is just there I guess. It covers approx. 5% of a game that lasts for an hour, so you don't really spend too much time in it, shame.ContentI've got only one thing to say about the content - More!. The game needs more planets, more story depth, more types of guns, more types of enemies, more collectibles, more puzzles, more bosses, more flying in space, more technical upgrades to your ship, more play time, more replayability, just literally, more of everything. Honestly, give this game a 10h playthrough time which implements new mechanisms, enemies and bosses gradually, add a decent story, raise the price accordingly and you have a really decent game!To compare, playing this game right now is like getting a new toy, figuring out how it works and suddenly, someone snaps it out of our hands. It just leaves hunger for moreOverallTo sum up, for the price you're going to get this, which is usually less than 1$, this game is totally worth it. But be warned, it literally has an hour of gameplay (exactly 53 minutes on my save file). I really hope that if the next part ever comes, it's going to have a significantly larger budget, which will allow creating a more in-depth experience with some solid (re)play value of at least 10+ hours.

												Very short little game that has a few nice ideas and an overall good quality (if you are not already fed up with pixel art and chiptunes). It could have been longer and more generous (the end is kind of abrupt) but I feel that it would have overstayed its welcome given that it has not the scope of a true metroidvania.Anyway, it offers a good couple of hours of puzzle/platforming with a sensible difficulty curve. Thus, with the original price tag, I truly recommend waiting for sales.			"

Goldfish bowl head starts out by flying a ship trying to shoot down space-captain-who's-his-face. (Can you tell none of the names stuck with me?) While the story and plot are pretty forgettable the game controls aren't in the slightest.

Gameplay: The basic controls are straight forward, you move right and left, jump and fire a portal gun, later you unlock a regular gun you can use to kill the various hostile NPC's. The controls work, I have been guilty of mixing up my two fire keybindings, which has resulted in death-by-NPC-face-hugging, or teleportation-into-pits-of-death (For clearification sake, your teleportation gun fires THROUGH NPC's hostile and friendly.), the controls weren't so bad for me, but the game really seems like it was designed more so with a controller in mind.But I'm getting ahead of myself, you start with just a Teleportation Gun, you fire a shot and when it connects with the wall, you teleport to the location of the laser/bullet. You actually have a few tricks you can pull off with the Teleportation gun early on, but don't learn about later in the game, so there is some skill that is developed with the Teleportation gun, rather then fire and teleport.

So once you finish playing the game, and if you start a new game you realize there are many hidden spots in the game that you originally had no idea where there. So that hints at the amount of time it takes to finish the game: it's a pretty short game, think an hour or two on average (Naturally the time to beat the game after your first, will rapidly decrease unless you're trying to find new locations and secrets).While I personally didn't find any of the puzzles too overwhelming, there's definitely plenty of difficulty to keep you mumbling obscenities under your breath as you get murdered again and again. While there's definitely more to the game, and plenty of content to keep you coming back, that's about all there is to say for the gameplay.Conclusion: As a whole, I enjoyed playing this game. This was one of the games I downloaded and played on my laptop while I was on a short little vacation away from my normal habitat. For using on lower powered computers I highly recommend this game, but when it comes to powered up computers that are normally playing MMORPG's or triple A titles... Out There Somewhere is still a pretty good diversion of a game. Pick it up on sale, play for a couple hours, go back to playing something else.

												This is a great little game! Very short (I beat it in under 1 hour), but it was very enjoyable, while it lasted.The visuals are nice, and so is the music. Nothing new in these 2 aspects, but they're faithful to the games that inspired this game and they're well done!The game has one main mechanic, and then some variations that support it. The mechanic is simply a teleport gun. You shoot a pellet that teleports you to it when it hits a wall. That's it. Despite its simplicity, though, it changes movement just enough to be ""surprising"", in some way, reaching escape velocity from ""generic platformer"".The level design is pretty good, always pushing you to use what you've learned about the teleport movement, instead of presenting normal platforms. There are also details spread throughout the game for speedrunners, which gives it another layer for those interested.The one complaint I have is that it is too easy, for the most part. There are hidden health-ups and armor for your ship, but these are mostly inconsequential to the game, so they're there for the extra challenge. Which is ok! The problem is that the game locks you out very often. You cross a certain section, and then you can't go back. This is a bit annoying, since the upgrades seen in one screen may require you to go around from another screen to get. So you may keep pushing forward, looking for the path, and then realize you can't go back... oops.Since the game is 1 hour long, this is not really a problem? But it's not optimal either, I would have prefered the other way.Anyway. Not much more to be said. It's not groundbreaking, but it's a very enjoyable title if you're looking for something quick, but still good!			"

												TL:DR, this game is great for its price. Granted, you'll only get ~5 hours of enjoyment from this but it is still pretty fun.The gameplay is very unique. I haven't seen anything like that in any other game I've played. It got me thinking really hard in the middle (though in the end, it got pretty easy to figure out.The story left quite a bit to be desired, with little to nothing explained about the characters. I leaned more about the main character from watching the trailer posted here than I did playing the game.The game itself felt... incomplete for lack of a better term. Right when I was having fun solving all the puzzles and finally getting the hang of it, the game cut to credits.While the game is short, you have to keep in mind that it is $2. It was a very fun and unique experience to me. I really hope the developers go farther with the gameplay ideas in future projects.			"

												For a game I paid about $0.20 USD for, I got 75 minutes or so of fairly straightforward puzzle-platformer-with-teleport-gun gameplay.  Nothing stood out as exceptional but nothing was lackluster either, which is a plus really considering the price and what someone might expect from the saturated indie platformed genre.  I didnt feel like my time was wasted and I had some fun with it.  I dont particularly like chiptune / bit-aesthetic music. but it was pretty catchy and pleasant to listen to.  The NPC character sprites were also pretty well animated which is a good touch as well.Some players I see complaining about the control scheme.  I could see it as a problem for some, but I'm used to a few similar games so I handled it pretty well.  I didn't test a controller but with the Steam Controller API I don't think it should be much of a problem if you want a custom mapping.All in all, it was good!			"

												Out there somewhere tries to make up for being incredibly short (<2 hours at best) and linear by being teeth grindingly hard. The entire game revolves around mastering trick jumps......and that's about it as far as game play. The only real indication  of it being ""inspired by"" metroid or cave story lays in the graphics and sound. The game looks and sounds great but there just isnt enough game to go with it.			"

												This short platformer's got soul, a cool 8 bit soundtrack and tight controls.I'll skip the story and let you figure that one out for yourselves. The core gameplay consists of platforming, shooting things and using your teleport gun to... well teleport around the place and get over obstacles. There are collectibles scattered all around the place which help you progress more easily and help with the final boss battle.The soundtrack compliments the mood that the artist has set here; marooned on a strange planet of slug creatures, now stop crying, take that teleport gun, fix your ship and get revenge! It's an incredibly fun experience although it is rather short. My first playthrough took me a little bit over an hour and 30 minutes to complete. Second was a bit over 40 minutes and the last speedrun was just under 20 minutes.I wouldn't hesitate getting this game even at full price though I must note that it was on sale with a hefty -96% discount when I bought it.

												This review is going to be a little bit unfair, but then I feel I was misled. At the time of this writing, the ""About"" section describes this game as ""Inspired by games such as Cave Story and Super Metroid"", and it's tagged as a ""Simulation"", ""Strategy"", and ""Metroidvania"" game.It is none of these things. This is a short, hard, linear puzzle platformer, with brief side-scrolling shooter bookends. The game as it is is pretty okay, and I got it on sale, but I spent my entire playtime wondering when the game map was going to open up and I was going to start getting interesting upgrades, which never happened.Bottom line, misleading store page, thumbs down.

												Well, some pixels here and there, few will love it instantly, few will hate, and the rest? Well, they will land on the planet and will die a lot, just because it is fun, challenging and rewarding once they'll master controls and tricks. Storyline isn't complex but it's not a bad thing for Out There Somewhere and yet you feel good once you make progress, and notice as sprites changes. When you found out the pattern of combined challenge and exploration you improve with controls and tricks and overall game experience gets better and better, because every part of the game is like a puzzle, once you start getting whole image game becomes great. Out There Somewhere is casual platformer with nice pixels and enjoyable chiptunes which can take up few hours to complete, depending on your teleporting performance. Play it in a spare moment and you won't regret time spent on Out There Somewhere. Sequel would be nice, tho. 9/10			"

												This is a fun but short platformer/shooter.I appreciate that the developers used multiple game modes.  This is tough to do, and normally one of the game modes feels tacked on.  In this case the platformer is the more developed of the modes, but the shooting sequences are not bad.The art is nothing to write home about, but the gameplay is fun and that is what matters.  If you are looking for a short, interesting time waster then this one is for you.7/10			"

												I purchased this game for $0.19 and I could say that it's worth at least this amount, but it is most certainly not worth the full price. Out There Somewhere has a very brief playtime of about an hour and, as it aesthetically calls back to older games with similar playtimes, this would normally be fine. I say normally because this is where the problem lies - while many games from the era Out There Somewhere seeks to mimic can technically be finished in an hour or less, they are usually challenging enough (though not necessarily always for good reasons) to occupy players for hours before they can scrape by with a victory. Out There Somewhere, on the other hand, simply poses so little challenge for the vast majority of its duration that I can count the number of rooms with any sense of difficulty from either the puzzles or the platforming on a single hand (4).This is a case of a game where the concept simply does not live up to its full potential. The teleport gun is a neat mechanic, but it is a largely wasted one as environmental obstacles and puzzles are repeatedly reused in the same handful of ways - you're going to be shooting at a whole lot of blue beams either halfway up a jump or on the way down from a jump in order to reach a platform a bit farther away. There are a few optional secrets, but as this is primarily a puzzle game it is not really worth the effort to go back through the whole game again if you miss one the first time around.While aesthetically appealing, Out There Somewhere is ultimately an unsatisfactory experience as it is lacking in narrative, challenge, and, other than the concept itself, any real sense of creativity.

												A really nice and simple puzzle platformer done in the 16-bit style. It is fairly easy and short, controls are easy to learn and responsive, but the puzzles do requier some accurate timing skills, so it's not trivial to play through. There's also a small shoot-em-up minigame done in the same style. The graphics and music are very nice and fit well to the overall retro atmosphere.Even it costs practically nothing the game is way too short and leaves you wanting for more.

												Out there somewhere is a really interesting 2D platfomer where you have to use a portal gun to move on to the next level. The game has a really great soundtrack and overall a pretty interesting idea. It has a pretty boring story but that's ok in my opinion.The big reason why I can't recommend this game is because of it's ""portal jumping"" mechanic, in the game you can't double jump so what you have to do is shoot your portal gun towards the wall and than jump in mid-air. It's very difficult to control and really hard to master. So a large part of this game is really just trying to get to a certain platform by portal jumping, with not much else going on.I got this game for about $0.51 when it was on sale so I can't really complain too much, but for me this game is definitely not worth the $2 price tag. Maybe if you're overflowing with money than this might not seem like that big of a deal to you, but for those of us who are on a budget and don't have too much cash than spend your money on something else "

The Short:-Short and sweet way to get your platforming fix.The Thick::Pros::Interesting platforming dynamics made possible with unique teleport gun.Short enough to enjoy entire game in single play session.Priced fairly for what you get out of it (right now it is 1.99 USD and can be bought in indie bundle as well)Enjoyable throughout.::Cons::Really short. I continued my save file after the credits rolled in disbelief that the end came that quickly.NPCs are obnoxious. Most of them have nothing important to say and just get in the way of the gameplay flow.The platforming portion of the singular boss battle can be forced to only use his first two attacks simply by getting enough (like 3) attacks off on him during each cycle. This makes for an incredibly simple boss battle that felt more like just another platforming room rather than a boss.There is no real incentive to collect the optional ship parts. The shoot-em-up section of the boss battle is doable without upgrading the ship.Spoilers: Forced cliffhanger ending where the villian is still ""Out there somewhere.""Random Thoughts:I dunno... this game really makes me wonder if the developer didn't have a strict plan for what they wanted to make. The existance of relatively numerous NPCs suggest that there was going to be more of a purpose for them. Maybe for lore/world-building purposes? There also is really weird pacing in the game... though it is difficult to describe with the game being so short. I suspect (though I should note I have no idea if this is true) that this was planned to be a longer game. It certainly feels like there should be more (again, the price is very fair for what you get), and like many others seem to be saying, this entire game feels like it should be the tutorial/intro level of a larger game... and I think that was probably the plan initially...Everything points to that theory:An abundance of NPCs most likely for world-buildingStylized artwork for textbox profiles and the rare cutsceneProgressive upgrade system for ship, which could have been spread out over the course of the game, as it felt completely unneccesary for the boss.Short to the point of it being unbelievable that the end falls where it doesSee final item on Cons.I do recommend this game because it's a great concept. I'm just disappointed that it wasn't explored further than it was. Don't get me wrong, I understand the limitations that a small team of developers can bring... I just think this could have been a great game. I'm disapointed not in the game, but in Miniboss for creating such a small game out of a concept with plentiful potential,			"

 Out There Somewhere It's a small game, but bunch of Fun you'll have. :) GamePlay: The gameplay is as simple as the game is and yet sometimes challenging. At the beginning you'll have no weapon, which will change very soon till you get a teleport gun!Teleporter gun: You can shoot with this gun and the time it hits an object you'll teleport to this point. Anyway this is just the half impressive part of it, because you can jump and while you're moving upward you can teleport yourself, but the physic of moving upward keeps. This is the part where it becomes a bit tricky to time you shoots.Normal gun: Additional to the telegun you'll also receive a normal gun to shoot enemies. If you acquire the additional upgrade you'll shoot faster and deadlier which makes the run way easier.This is the Charakter Gameplay. There are also objects in the world which tries to build up riddles for you. ;)I love the idea. <3 (One point loss because it's really short 1h 20min. first run. :/ I wish I could be longer)★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ Graphics: The graphics is a pixelstyle and not very impressive.^^ It looks very nice, but I just cannot give all points!★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ Story: The Story is also well made. ""Brevity is the soul of wit!"" this is something fitting to its story. It's indeed not very long, probably because of the length of the game, but you don't forget storypart which confuse you in futher progress.I really liked it. With some nice Cutscenes and dialogue.★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Leveldesign: If you want all Achievements then you should know that you have to visit (nearly) every screen in this game. literally!There are screens with no name and you'll have to see them to get the 107% Achievement. (I think it's pretty obvious why it's called 107%. :p)The normal screens are well created to make puzzles, as I've said it befor. ↑ up there ↑I don't see any reason to give less than the max. points.^^★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Music: My favorite part of any game with good music recommendation. <3 Well, this game contains so many good soundtracks. I nearly love all of them and for a good reason. If you wanna take a look at the main Theme:  Menu Theme ★ ★ ★ ★ ★The summary is, I would buy it again and the most time it is in sale for less than 30c. xD Get it. It's worth to play!★ ★ ★ ★ ★			"

												I stumbled upon this game as was searching through Steam for something to play - and I'm *so* glad I did. The art grabbed my attention, as did the very positive reviews, so I checked it out. Here's what I think:PROS--------------------------------------------- Excellent gameplay (it's so cool that people are *still* finding new things to do with platformers. I love it! ^_^ )- Tight controls. I never felt overwhelmed, and that's a good thing.- Great art! (though I'm not sure why the backgrounds were moving underground - maybe to keep things visually interesting >_< )- The tone, feel and setting are all really good.- The pacing is just incredible. I started playing it saying, 'I'll just play it for a little while', and the game moves at such a pace that I found myself playing for far longer than I thought. I beat the game in two sittings! I love games that can grab your attention and keep it like that.- The characters and puzzles kept me glued to my chair. I tell ya - there's something great about this game. Once you start - you don't want to put the game down!- Frequent checkpoints that enforce the fact that you're always making progress.- I also really like the fact that the last boss, while challenging is not SUPER-HARD-OH-MY-GOSH-YOU'LL NEVER-BEAT-THIS that so many platformers end with. While challenging, the game is more fun than hard - and I like that a lot.CONS----------------------------------------- The music, while good, never really connected with me. I still listen to the 'Shovel Knight' and 'Super Mario 3D World' soundtracks, for example. But here, nothing really jumped out. The music is not bad - it just didn't stand out to me.- While the controls felt fair, there were a few parts that I thought the difficulty curve was a bit steep. Reflecting back on it, I think it's because the devs wanted to put in as many different puzzles in as small a time frame as possible. I never got stuck or had to look solutions up online (which is great!), but smoothly transitioning from one puzzle to another sometimes felt a little weird. Maybe that's a nitpick. Just thought I'd mention it.- At a little over two hours, the game is *short*. What it lacks in length, it more than make up for in variety and fun, though.OVERALL----------------------------------------I was really pleasantly surprised with 'Out There Somewhere'. The pacing was excellent, the art was really fun and quirky and the platforming action kept me coming back for more (and kept showing me things I'd never seen before - so I loved that). I loved the fact that I went into this 'blind', so everything it showed me was a surprise. Love it! I had a great time and I look forward to seeing what else the devs have made. Bring on more great games! :)FINAL SCORE---------------------------------------8.5 out of 10			"

Some of the moves are pretty tricky to pull off with some very strict timing required and might be frustrating to inexperienced players. An experienced platformer player might get through this in about an hour- there's an achievement for speed-running it in less than 20 minutes and I managed to do it in 15 after some practice. At full price this is a good buy- at 19p in the sales, it's a no-brainer.			"

												Puzzle games don't have to be difficult to be stimulating. Out There Somewhere keeps my brain stimulated with constantly changing and quality music, scenery, and puzzles. It doesn't revolutionize, but it's still a very polished and solid experience. I think full price is asking a bit much for the short length, but you know how Steam works. Add the game to your wishlist and grab it when it goes on sale for around $1.99. I for one, got it on sale for $0.19. Needless to say, totally worth it.			"

												Great but short game, only about two hours.  Don't buy it full price though, because it's almost always on sale.  Simple controls and controller support make this game easy to play.  I would say it is Portal as a platformer.  8/10.(Only 6 mins on record because i played it offline, in game time 236 mins)			"

												Bought it for 50 cents, but I would have gladly paid full price and beyond for this game. It's a charming platformer that manages to be challenging without being impossibly so. It utilizes creative gameplay mechanics that revolve around a gun that teleports you, which adds a puzzle-like quality to getting through some of the screens. It also has a fantastic soundtrack.My only disappointment with the game is how short it is, because I want more.			"

												I forgot what this game was about or how much I had paid for it. Decided to boot it to see what it was about and was welcomed with a shmup. Nothing all that exciting but it did look nice. Then you're introduced to the bigger part of the game, which is a puzzle platformer of sorts.I was immediately very impressed by the quality of the game, visually first then everything after. The puzzles were smart but not very complex; not that they were not enjoyable.I thought I was just starting and next thing I know, and hour or so later, I finished the game. I was a disappointed, especially considering how highly I regarded the game. It showed so much promise.Then I went to the store page and saw that the game is actually 1$. And I'm fairly certain I bought it on sales.I don't really feel like playing through it again right now but it was a lot of fun while it lasted and if you are up for it, you can complete more than one playthrough to get more hidden stuff. It's well, well worth the 1$, very short but very high quality.No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, no pointless fillers, this game doesn't try to make up for what it lacks in content by throwing tedious stuff in. Just the essential, just what you need to have fun.			"

												I can only recommend this game at the price I got it at, $0.19. At that price, it's well worth it. At the price listed, it's really not. The game throws you onto an alien world in a story that tries to be more than it is. If this game is part of a series, something would be explained, but on its own it is unremarkable. The big hook to the game is that you have a teleporting gun that allows you to warp to wherever you hit with the gun. You retain your momentum, so much like Portal you encounter some interesting puzzles. The puzzles are seldom difficult, with the only real difficulty coming from the imprescision you deal with. Occasionally you'll encounter something where you have to think in order to proceed, but I got through these by just shooting and somehow ending up where I needed to be. There is a secondary weapon that damages enemies as well. It was a good choice to introduce this weapon, as it does introduce some variety in the gameplay. However, the weapon never quite ""feels"" right. It's hard to explain. Combat, for what there is of it, feels frustrating, especially when you fail later in the room and have to do it over again. Still, having the gun does add to the gameplay. When you die, you respawn quickly. This is good since you will want to try again quickly, but sometimes it can lead to you dying 2 or 3 times in a row because you're still moving when you spawn. This futher compounds the difficulty of a particularly tough puzzle.The game lasts about 45 minutes. I enjoyed most of my time with it, and there are some interesting obstacles introduced throughout, but I did find myself wishing things would get mixed up a little more towards the end, or just wanting the game to end. Overall, there's a lot of potential here. The teleporter gun brings some neat ideas, and the environments are well built around the mechanic. And it's worth the price at 96% off. It's a nice little game, that shows that the developer has a lot of upward potential for their next games.			"

												I can recommend this game, but not at the price they're charging. The game is extremely short - one or two hours long. It feels like it's over just as soon as you've figured out how to play. The controls are interesting, but they don't feel all that tight. (They're not bad, but not great either.) The graphics, sound, and music get the job done but aren't particularly compelling. The level design is pretty decent, but not great. There is some mildly humorous dialog. All-in-all, it's a decent game, but it's just so short.Get the game if it's on sale, maybe.			"

Product received for free
												A space metrovania game. I believe i got this game for free as a gift from a friend if i recall.Anyways this game is quite short. Notice my time above the review? That is how long it took me to beat the game. Be aware i probably did not find every secret or searched the levels extensively.One thing i found annoying about this game was the fact on some maps your forced to go only one way, even though the game is clearly meant to be like a metrovania game that should let you go back to older maps, but some maps it is incredibly hard, if not impossible to do.Because of the way the maps are, i cannot recommend this game. Playing it again got very repetitive very fast. If your into these type of games, this might be fun for you...but due to shortness, very difficult traversing maps, and also, the music was a bit bland to me.			"

												One of the most adorable indie platformers I've played.Out There Somewhere gets all things right. You have to explore a weird planet in order to be able to launch your ship into space (again). The controls are very simple - you only get to use 3 buttons (teleport gun, jump and gauss gun), other than the directional ones, throughout the entire game - but that's more than enough in order to tackle the game's puzzles, enemies and areas.Most of the areas require a bit of thinking, and in some cases, reflexes, in order to reach the ""end"" of the screen and get to the next one. Every screen represents an entirely different area you need to pass.Out There Somewhere is challenging enough for gamers of all ages and levels, but at the same time, you will never feel frustrated, even if you fail to overcome a certan obstacle in several attempts. The game's atmosphere and (retro) music are just too adorable for that.The game can be completed in ~2 hours. And while it may not be a game that will keep you coming back for more, unless you're an achievement junkie, you can rest assured that it will provide you with few hours of pure, retro platforming fun!

												Very nice and short game. The core ideas behind it are nothing we haven't seen before, but the gameplay and the mechanics are really well implemented and they're fun to play with. The only thing I did not like so much is that it was a little too short and that it was really easy to beat. I never really needed to look for info online or anything like that, and each screen took me at most just a couple of deaths before achieving it. Expect to beat this game in about an hour. For the price it usually gets on steam, however, this is a no brainer.I got all the achievements but one which is impossible to get because of a bug (Please, fix it soon, devs!). The truth is that I wasn't expecting much from this game and what I found instead was a really neat little adventure that I enjoyed a lot. I really recommend trying this game out. It's cheap, it's great and t won't take you too long to beat. Definitely worth it :)			"

												Simple and short but extremely fun and creative little platform/puzzle game. This game was made by a very small team, and it's a really impressive achivement! You've got an extremely limited move set - you can jump around, you can fire a teleport beam, and you eventually get a blaster - but you'll use that limited move set in a wide variety of funny, clever, unexpected ways. There were so many times where I thought, ""Oh, this trick move won't work"", and then it did! So then what if I jump off here and then shoot my beam there, but before I land, I jump and then...oh, that worked too! The game is just full of surprises like that and all these puzzles that test your creativity, logic, and ability to exploit the mechanics. I also really like the pixel graphics - the art style is charming and memorable. I don't actually have any real critiques here! It's a short game, but it never outstays its welcome. There are even a decent amount of secrets and it'll take you a while to really collect everything. On top of all of these strengths, Out There Somewhere is really cheap - it even often goes on sale for something like 25 cents. You can't beat that! You can wait for one of those super cheap sales if you like, but this is an awesome little game at any price. In fact, this is probably one of the best deals on Steam, bar none.			"

												This game is an incredibly fun 2D platformer that plays similar to Metroid, albeit with a much greater emphasis on platforming puzzles than shooting and exploration. I haven't played Portal, but from what I gather, this is what Portal would be like if it were a 2D game.The controls are perfect, and the game even detects and gives accurate input suggestions for my original Xbox controller that I am using via an unofficial USB adapter and the XBCD third party driver.For the great asking price, you almost can't afford not to give this game a try if you need something fun to play. It's worth getting simply to listen to the catchy music.The developer has really impressed me with this title. Bravo!			"

												Where to start with this one? Well I got it for a beautiful 19 cents. Entering the game, I was assaulted with the most amazing 16-bit(?) soundtrack that I had ever heard in my life. I could already tell that it would be fun. And it is. For how simple it is gameplay wise, the art, story, mechanics, and overall game universe was simply incredible. Ontop of it all, everything was diverse. There was an outstanding variety in enemies and characters, and the fact that there's no linear path for you to follow is great. You can play the game over mutliple times and take different paths to do so. 10/10 would get exploded by 3 pixel bat again.			"

												i picked this game up for 15 pence and didn't really expect too much from it however after starting it up i was pleasently surprised to realise that it is a wonderful game and i cannot reccomend it enough to anyone wo is a fan of platformers or puzzle games as this has elements of both in it. The puzzles are bothe simple and yet confusing for a first time through and yet when you figure it out you will be wondering how you couldn't see the solution earlier if i could nitpick one thing it's that there is no way to turn off the tutorials if you intend on a second playthrough. Also i sold the cards from it for 18 pence so i came out with a great game and financial profit.			"

												I picked this game up for about 20 whole cents, and boy, can I ever say it was worth it.My first playthrough lasted me about an hour, but at the end, I felt satisfied. Since then, I've played through the game several more times to explore, collect, and just speed through it. Out There Somewhere doesn't do much, I'll say that. However, what it does, it does VERY well. I'm still thirsting for more.The controls for the game felt tight and I had no issues with moving, shooting, or jumping (I use a controller). Not once did I feel like I could blame the game for falling or dying. It was just a matter of getting faster with the timing, or better at positioning.As far as sound goes, the music is incredibly well done. There are several tracks in the game that change as you progress through the different areas. A few of the tracks are just mindblowingly good for how small the game is. As for sound effects, there aren't an awful lot, but they aren't ear grating which is nice.Aesthetically, the game looks wonderful. If the audio wasn't enough to tell you that Cave Story was an inspiration, the visuals will help remind you. I find the graphics to be very pleasing and easy on the eyes, and it's very easy to tell the different mechanics apart so the puzzles don't feel as frustrating to figure out.Finally, the gameplay. The gameplay is very basic. You can run, you can shoot your portal, and you can shoot your gun. Not much else to it, but that isn't a bad thing. The puzzles aren't overly difficult, either, but there is definitely a learning curve to them. My first time playing, I'd take a few minutes to figure out some of the puzzles. In later playthroughs, it's fun to see just how fast you can get through the puzzles that had stumped you before. Just because the puzzles aren't overly difficult doesn't detract from how rewarding it is to solve them.Overall, the game is very well done. For just $0.20, I'd say it's absolutely worth it. Even for $5.00, I'd say it's worth it if you plan to play through the game multiple times, trying to complete it. Out There Somewhere was a surprising hit, and I'm absolutely glad that I purchased it.			"

												When Steams summer sale was going, I decided to buy lots of 19 cent games, because why not. Without saying, almost everyone of those games seemed to be... below avarage and usually end up idling cards for them, but this game was a nice exeption. When I opened the game what I found was really well polished indie puzzle platformer. It doesn't offer anything majorly groundbreaking nor flashy, but because everything feels, looks and sounds really nice, it kept me interested in it. Pacing seems great with new mechanics introduced slowly, once gotten hang of the momentum mechanic controls feel tight and music makes you want to keep going even after several deaths. Only negative may be that it's an hour experience, for some it may not feel like worthwhile to give money, but there's something great about beating game in single day and it's freaking cheap!Shout out to awesome soundtrack as well: https://miniboss.bandcamp.com/releases- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Kun Steamissa oli kesäalennukset, päätin muuten vain ostella paljon 19 sentin pelejä. Sanomattakin melkein kaikki niistä oli... keskivertoa huonompia ja suurimmasta osasta tyydyin saamaan kortit, mutta tämä peli oli mukava poikkeus tähän. Kun avasin pelin huomasin sen olevan hyvin viimeisen päälle kiillotettu indie tasohyppely pulmapeli. Se ei tarjoa mitään maata räjäyttävää tai kiiltävää, mutta koska kaikki tuntuu, näyttää ja kuulostaa erittäin hyvältä, se piti minut kiinnostuneena. Pelin tahti tuntuu hyvältä ja uusia mekaniikkoja tulee hitaalla tahdilla vastaan, kun vauhtimekaniikkaan pääsee sisälle kontrollit tuntuvat tiukoilta ja musiikki pitää pelissä vaikka olisi juuti kuollut muutamaan kertaan. Ainoa negatiivinen asia taitaa olla että se on todellakin vain tunnin mittainen, joka voi joillekin olla ehkä liian pieni kokemus josta pitäisi maksaa, mutta se tunne että pääsee pelin läpi yhdessä päivässä on erittäin mukava ja se on järkyttävän halpaa! Myös maininta mahtavalle pelin soundtrackille: https://miniboss.bandcamp.com/releases "

												Out There Somewhere is a 2014 platformer developed by unknown studio Miniboss. Another in a long line of Super Metroid lookalikes, it's enjoyed some success mainly due to being incredibly cheap. But rather then simply riding on the coattails of Super Metroid (or Knytt, as it were), Out There Somewhere proves to be an enjoyable linear puzzle platformer, with a teleportation mechanic that features conservation of momentum similar to Portal (though the two have no real similarity beyond that).  It's no metroidvania by any stretch of the imagination - most of the ""upgrades"" are for an endgame effect that doesn't amount to much, and outside of that venture there's a total of 5 collectibles. Instead of playing a retro pixel wannabe, I played a well-paced linear adventure, that nevertheless isn't perfect. Most of the pacing is due to just how short it is - a playthrough won't run you longer than an hour (15 minutes if you know what you're doing) and the sheer lack of enemy variety becomes apparent on subsequent playthroughs. Add to that, that while the sprites are well designed and look quite nice on inspection (thankfully, not using the retro clause of pixel art to turn out subpar product) the very poorly handed tiling and lack of visual noise make the game's art look much more amateur than it really is.This is most readily apparent during the intro and outro space battles. With a closer look, you can see the spaceships slowly rotating, the metal sheens and the sci fi aesthetic shining through, when taken as a whole it looks so empty and barren that you could mistake it for a first-year highschooler's Game Maker project. These aren't particularly pressing issues; Out There Somewhere suffers from a lack of talking points. This isn't a particularly interesting game, and for all the secrets thrown into its linear world or the cool design of the protagonist, if this game hadn't gone for 20 cents then I wouldn't be recommending it. I wouldn't have even bought it. I've played Newgrounds games with more lasting value. At $5, I wouldn't recommend it unless you're the type that goes for 100% completion. At the ridiculous sales price, I fully recommend Out There Somewhere as a snack-sized short romp to pace out the larger, more memorable videogames.			"

												Somewhat simple to solve plattformer. In my first attempt I needed under an hour, and there wasn't really a puzzle that made me ponder more than a few moments. (However, I do have a long history of plattformer experience, so it might be a decent difficulty for casual gamers and beginners)Its still a charming game though. I liked the bouncy retro graphics, the ""all your base are belong to us""esque-cutscenes with the very flat dialogues and even enjoyed the music in this short retro flashback.So: If you can get it really cheap on a sale like I did, and enjoy oldschool puzzle plattformers with a relaxing difficulty, I don't think you can go wrong with it. The full prize would've been too high for my taste though.			"

												Not bad at all. Seeing the retro style graphics, you might think that this is one of those trash indie games that people make to grab some quick cash (I don't hate retro or 8-bit graphics at all, its just that this is overused to make lots of trash games found across steam). Level 1 further fuels your doubt with the old space shooter thing.But the idea of the teleport gun introduced in level 2 makes it a rather unique platformer with an original concept. This together with the throwaway price makes this a recommendable buy.Also has trading cards and achievements.			"

The main focus of the game is exploration and teleporation and both goes hand in hand rather well. Defenately something you need to play for yourself if you enjoy indie developed games.			"

												Graphics - 9/10, fit this game 100% perfectly. It is pleasing to look at but it can be too dark even with your brightness all the way up. If they just did a lighting overhaul it would go a long way.Story - 6/10, there isn't really a whole lot of story to this game. Basically you are on a space ship when aliens attack it, so naturally you go and fight them. You are overwhelmed and crash into an alien planet. You need to find a power core to get of the planet. During the game you hear from a few different NPC's that Grigori is a monster and they wish he wasn’t around, you also hear also hear he has that power core you need. So you take off on a mission to kill Grigori and get the power core.Gameplay - 9/10, while I want to say that this game has perfect gameplay, I can't. I personally feel that the beginning and ending space battles are unnecessary; I feel these two scenes are completely different from the rest of the game. Every other part of the game is plat-forming genius but then you have these button mashing sequences basically.Soundtrack - 8/10, I like the soundtrack this game has but I prefer to listen to my own music while I play because I'm personally not a huge fan of the ""Classic Pixel Style"" this game uses. But I do recognize that this a very well done soundtrack and I consider it worth having in my iTunes library.Overall - 32/40, even though I only have a short amount of time on this game as I am writing this (Currently 8 hours or so) I plan to add a lot more because I love this game. It is really addictive and I really recommend you buy it. I think it's worth full price but I imagine quite a few people would want to buy it when its on sale because it is so short. "

 SPOILER ALERT	I feel like that game is really worth the price... best spent 19 cents on a game. The Story	Humanity is in peril, Allies receives a signal that the notorious villain Grigori is attacking again and decide to call Yuri - our hero for help.As he sets out to fight Grigori, his ship gets destroyed and he sees Grigori landing on an unknown planet and he decides to follow him without any other choice since he crashes on the planet.As soon as our hero lands he sees that Grigori has imprisoned the intelligent life on this planet.          He must free the planet's citizens, find a power source to get his ship to work again and defeat Grigori for good. Gameplay	The game revolves mostly around teleporting which is done via your teleporting gun (It's nothing like portal's portal gun).You get teleported the moment your bullet hits a wall and you depending on your timing you can jump after teleporting which can help you reach otherwise unreachable locations and it makes up for really clever platforming.The movement and shooting once you obtain your Gauss gun really remind me of Cave Story which is a good thing.You can also collect 3 Alien artifacts with each one making you more durable to damage. Pros.	+Great pixelated art                 +Great music                                +Alot of replay value+Memorable protagonist+Fluid Gameplay.+Alot of secret collectibles. Cons.	-Really short Final Verdict   9.6/10	 "

												Out There Somewhere is a neat little 2D Game. You can compare the design to the Metroid games and all in all the game structure really reminds me of ""You Have To Win The Game"", what is, by the way, a really nice game.A short assessment by myself:Story: 8/10   It is the classical ""Hero-Kills-Evil"" concept as it is in Megaman. Yuri is Megaman and Gregori is Dr. Wily.Soundtrack: 100/10 The soundtrack fits perfect and is just genius.Level Design: 10/10  It reminds of Metroid as I mentioned before.Controls: 5/10 The control is the only thing I want to criticize. I highly recommend to play this game with  a Game Pad, because it is a little bit awkward with the keyboard. (Compareable to ""Super Meat Boy"" + Keyboard"" just worse...!)Difficulty: 10/10 Although you cannot adjust the difficulty in the game options you are able to play this game without getting frustrated. There are maybe some points where it can take a minute longer than usual but all in all the game is quiet easy.But it gets much more difficult when you try to find all cores or try to collect all steam achievements.

Simple platformer with some nice mechanics that lead to a game that you play 'screen by screen'.  Each screen provides a puzzle to beat.  These puzzles are usually fairly straightforward and I only had a couple of screens that gave me trouble (but which were very easy once the solution hit).Takes as little as 20 minutes to beat (there's an achievement), but expect about 60-90 minutes if you start hunting down the hidden areas / achievements.

												Picked it up in a Steam Sale for $.19 which was an amazing deal. It's a short game, my first playthrough was just over an hour. Some people might complain about that, but I thought it was perfect. With all the games in my backlog, I prefer a lean game that plays well, and isn't full of fluff.The game has a very straightforward premise, you crash land on a planet and need to find parts to repair your ship. You start off with a gun that shoots portals that you teleport to when they hit a surface. Every screen has some sort of puzzle requiring timing and finesse to progress. You eventually get a pea shooter, but it's mainly for breaking rocks and getting the odd enemy out of your way.There are a fair amount of achievements that require a second playthrough, but it's pretty much a breeze, because once you're familiar with the mechanics of the game, you can plow right through it.

												Out There Somewhere is a exploration platformer with a mechanic of teleportation. You control Yuri on his quest to repair his ship and escape the planet he crashed on. Armed with a teleportation gun which allows you to fire a shot and then teleport where it lands, you must use this mechanic to your advantage to progress.This game makes excellent use of its core mechanic. The platforming feels solid and incorporates the telegun very well. The difficulty curve feels right, gradually increasing so the player has to use what they have learned in prior levels in new and different ways. Progressing requires quick reflexes and some thinking, and death isn't a hindrance due to instant-respawn. The aesthetic of the game is great, with pixel visuals, and the chiptune soundtrack adds to the feel. The game is a bit short, however. It took me about an hour of gametime to beat the game on my first run, and it left me wanting more. What the game provides is excellent and leaves me wanting more, which could have easily been added. The final boss felt a little underwhelming and could probably have used the game's mechanics better. Overall, I rate Out There Somewhere a 8/10, on the basis that the game is a bit short.			"

												""Inspired by Cave Story, Metroid, and Portal""I think a better mashup is Cave Story, R-type, and Portal (with a much smaller scope). I didn't personally get the Metroid vibes.Out There Somewhere is a fun short game (I beat it in about 45 minutes) with good aesthetics and decent level of difficulty. It may only leave you wanting more, as the whole game feels more like a ""first stage"" than a complete game. It definitely has the potential to be something much greater, but overall, I still recommend it. I'd make sure to grab it on sale though, as in my mind, the game is too short for the full price.

												A cute little game by a developer who obviously loves the style and genre.  The puzzles weren't terribly difficult, though a couple required very exact precision and thus might take you one try or a hundred to get right.  Don't expect combat to be any more difficult than the puzzles.Definitely worth more than the nineteen cents they're charging during the Summer Sale.  Not sure if it's worth five dollars, though; it feels like the first chapter or so of a Metroidvania rather than an entire game.Keeping an eye on this developer!			"

												This was a fun and cute little game. The puzzle's arent particularly challenging if you are just running through it, but the secrets are tough to unlock (I didn't even get them all) and there are certainly a few puzzles that will stump you and will require you to take a break and come back to after a bit. I would enjoy a sequel with a lot more content. There is a lot of potential with this little platformer.			"

												Really great little game! I was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed it. (Especially the *second* playthrough!)The game starts with the basics of the teleport gun, and introduces more advanced nuances as you go, requiring you to think how to use the environment and your new techniques to overcome platforming ""puzzles"".  Many of them require quick timing, especially the later ones.  By the end of the game, it leaves you feeling very clever, and with a great feeling of accomplishment.And this is what got me super excited when after beating the game I went back and played through a second time, and suddenly realized there were a ton of new areas/secrets that I could now reach. Areas I could have reached all along, if I had only known the techniques before.There is actually still a secret I have yet to be able to reach, as I am playing without looking at any guides. I think I have figured out how to do it, but it requires amazing split-second timed jumps and shots. I'm enjoying the attempt though!Sure, you could blow throw the game in an hour or so, but finding all the secrets and/or trying to get all the achievements adds a lot more value, and replayability.  If you like clever platformers, give it a go! "

												The Good:Very fun teleporting mechanicRetro graphicsFunny little premiseCharming old school musicCheapThe Bad:Still pretty short even though it's cheapPotential to crash, but not gamebreaking due to many checkpointsOut There Somewhere is really good, and I liked it a lot, but I sort of wish it was fleshed out more. The vast majority of the game is simple puzzle platforming with a teleport gun with a small scroll shooter segment at the beginning and end. I understand this is indie and short, but I liked it so much I wish there were more planets and scroll shooter segments to play. You encounter some alien species and a few power-ups for your ship, but it's only for one more shooter segment. I think it would be cool to extend this idea into a larger game with explorable planets and just more of the same fun.I recommend this game because it's great and very fun, but it is short. Buy on sale if possible.			"

												Was on sale for 0.19$ so I kinda felt like I should buy it right?????RIGHT!?!?!?!??The cards are worth about 8-9 cents or so and it has some acheivments so you can get alot out of this.......game? oh right.The game is a platformer that has the retro feel along with a portal gun and a normal gun.......so how long does it last?I played this game and beat it in less then an hour and there is an acheivment for beating it in less then 20 minutes.I hate short games but considering what I paid for it I have no complaints this isnt a bad game.....but it could use artifical gameplay increasers.....like a animation when you load a screen so it isnt so fast and jerky or just more screens.[Update] I think this game is great and pays respect to old games but I feel like it lacks 1 thing......play time.......on the art cover thing for the store page you see some characters that are not even mentiond besides the little dialoug cutscene at the start........I would like them to be unlockable.

I have eight hours in this game, thats 10p an hour, and then there's the gameplay. The puzzles vary in hardness, but a lot of this requires high reaction time. Thus being said, I feel that the rage adds to the gameplay, but not in the way that puts you off the game and you leave to take up space space in your steam library for the rest of your life.

												I bought this game for 0,19€ during sales and I feel like I stole the game.The game's quality is well worth it's price (4,99€)^^. Review (SPOILERS!!)Graphics-The graphics are pixelated and are really nice to look at.They kinda remind me of Cave Story ^^. Gameplay-The gameplay is really interesting.You have a ship during the opening section and it's kinda like those arcade space shooters where you go up and down and shoot things that are coming infront of you.After the first short ship section is over you are able to walk on the ground, you have a portal gun but it's nothing like the one from ,,Portal series"" more like a Teleport gun. The teleport gun teleports you when the projectile hit's a wall or something else and it makes for some pretty clever ways to pass trough an obstacle. You can find a gun at some point an you can kill enemies with it. There are hidden ship parts an heart containers, the ship parts can be used to upgrade your ship for the final boss battle and the heart containers to make you capable of taking more hits before kicking the bucket. There are only 2 ship sections in the game and they are : Introduction section and final boss ^^. Story-The story is very simple, your space ship is under attack by a notorious villain called Grigori and at the first ship part of the game your ship gets damaged and you crash on an unknown planet. You (the captain of the ship) need to repair your ship and catch Grigori.Grigori is finally defeated by the end of the game or is he?Maybe he is still ,, Out There Somewhere"" Pros +Stage Design.                                        +Music suits                                   the game                                    perfectly.+Good cutscene Art.+Responsive controls.+Fluid sprite animation.+More than one wayto complete the game.+Cards are easy to get.Cons-Kinda Short.-Some music tracksare forgettable.-,,But How?""

												Graphics - 9/10, fit this game 100% perfectly. It is pleasing to look at but it can be too dark even with your brightness all the way up. If they just did a lighting overhaul it would go a long way.Story - 6/10, there isn't really a whole lot of story to this game. Basically you are on a space ship when aliens attack it, so naturally you go and fight them. You are overwhelmed and crash into an alien planet. You need to find a power core to get of the planet. During the game you hear from a few different NPC's that Grigori is a monster and they wish he wasn’t around, you also hear also hear he has that power core you need. So you take off on a mission to kill Grigori and get the power core.Gameplay - 9/10, while I want to say that this game has perfect gameplay, I can't. I personally feel that the beginning and ending space battles are unnecessary; I feel these two scenes are completely different from the rest of the game. Every other part of the game is plat-forming genius but then you have these button mashing sequences basically.Soundtrack - 8/10, I like the soundtrack this game has but I prefer to listen to my own music while I play because I'm personally not a huge fan of the ""Classic Pixel Style"" this game uses. But I do recognize that this a very well done soundtrack and I consider it worth having in my iTunes library.Overall - 32/40, even though I only have a short amount of time on this game as I am writing this (Currently 8 hours or so) I plan to add a lot more because I love this game. It is really addictive and I really recommend you buy it. I think it's worth full price but I imagine quite a few people would want to buy it when its on sale because it is so short. "

I had to set my own from the start of the game, but once I got use to it it was fine.-I found the boss fight nearly impossible with keyboard controls because I was trying to dodge things while flying in all directions with arrow keys, and I had to also focus on shooting him with a different button. It would have been much easier with a controler.Besides all of that, it is a great little game, with interesting mecanics and good puzzles that aren't too difficult.

												really well-done platformer. simple, tight controls, easy to grasp gameplay that changes enough to keep it interesting. it's pretty well priced (although i'd say get it on sale 'cause i got mine for 19 cents), even if it is incredibly short. an hour/hour and a half of gameplay max, but it's a great hour and a half. the spritework and animations are very well done. 9/10, could possibly stand to be a bit longer but all in all it's pretty great.

												If it's on sale, buy it, even if you don't like it you can get your money back from selling the cards, besides, it's one of the best puzzle platformers I played, even if it's short it still gives you quite some fun.9/10, music is a bit annoying and the game could be longer, otherwise, it's great.

												This game is an excellent platformer with a twist. The puzzles may be a bit simple, but the timing required sometimes isn't. It reminds me of ""My First Quantum Translocator"". The game is a bit short, though it has plenty of replay value if you try to get all of the achievements.			"

												Well, today this game is on sale for 20 cents so you're probably buying it anyway. It's quite a tricky little platformer with a jump/teleport mechanic and a fair share of puzzles to accompany it. Unfortunately it's very short; it took me 75 minutes to beat it the first time. It has collectible energy tanks so you could play it again and 100% it for some replay value. But in a way it's comparable to VVVVVV; it doesn't overuse its mechanics, which explains the fact that it's not very long. So a pretty balanced game for (basically) free.			"

												(8/10)Cute little game thats a fusion of the various games it mentions in its blurb.  The music/graphics are very reminiscent of cave story, as are the very tight controls.  The main game is an exploratory metroidvania style, with a few secrets and some definite portalish puzzle solving.The various elements gel very well together and the overall play was fun and engaging, while it lasted.  I'm not normally a 'time snob' but it definitely felt like the game was over all too soon.  Aiding that was the notion that there was never really a chance to go back and grab all those secrets you saw glimpses of earlier.  If you miss it, odds are, you missed it, and thats that.I may actually do a second walkthrough enhanced run just to see what effects some of the last things i didn't do would have, but as it stands if you mostly just do forward progress you can probably beat it in just an hour or two.  (some kinda plus mode, or just some oportunity to 'turn back' at the end so you could finish collecting would have been appreciated).As it stands though I did like it, and did have fun, and would reccomend it specifically to cave story fans who also like puzzle games because more than anything else this is a great fusion of those two styles.

												Ignore anyone saying this is not a good game, For they are F4GG0T5.Great little platformer harkening back to the days of commander keen, cave story and other similar otherwordly 2d jump and fight festivals.Really nice mechanics, smooth and fair gameplay and some puzzles that (while not being particularly challenging) are interesting and fun enough to keep you interested until the end. It is NOT a long game but I think this almost works in its favour. I think something like this would get irksome/annoying if they focused much more on timed jumping and awkward, multi-stage puzzles which I suppose they'd have to do to ramp up the difficulty any further.As it is the challenge is pleasant, it's fun to look for the extra secrets and (I thought) the game had a nice atmosphere. Perhaps it's not everyones cup of tea and if you're a resolutely modern (F4G1T) gamer then this might not please you but if you like to do more with your gaming time than endless games of CS:GO whilst pulling at your pants and screaming obscenities down the mic then this might well be something you'll enjoy.I was gifted the game but I believe it was really cheap lately and would definitely have been worth that price but I'd say, also, that at full price it's still a worthwhile investment. There's a fair chunk of replayability and I think it's sensible to support people making games like this as it's the textbook definition (to me) of ""A fun game"". There are just under 1000 games in my steam library, 90% of which I have NEVER played. I played this solidly until completion.Then I completed it again.10/10 kept my mind busy and gave me no desire to pull at my pants or scream down a microphone. It doesn't even HAVE mic support.			"

												Definitely worth checking out if you like the metroidvania style. The teleport puzzle mechanic is used perfectly, progressively getting more difficult without becoming frustrating or wearing itself out. The pixel art is detailed and music is fantastic, the levels felt alive as I was going through them. The only downside to this game is that it's very short. You'll get about an hour out of the campaign and I recommend going after the achievements as they'll give you a few more playthroughs.			"

												========================================Vince Rowe ReviewsSaving the Industry one Game at a Time![YouTube Link]  [Curation Link]  ========================================An amazing little puzzle platformer coupled with great 8-bit music and good old fashioned collectables!Verdict - 8.0/10Scroll to the bottom for an 'Overall' on the game.Gameplay - 9/10:Out There Somewhere starts off as a side-scroller shooter that you're pretty much destined to lose causing you to crash down to the planet below - this is where the real game begins. It's a pretty simple platformer but the twist is the teleport gun you get, it shoots like an ordinary gun and you'll be teleported to where it hits instantly with all of your momentum preserved. It flows really well making the movement of the game extremely fluid. You also get a 'Guass Gun' which is basically just a pew pew that kills enemies and breaks blocks. There are a few NPCs with a little bit of inane dialogue, and collectables littered across the landscape which - a majority of them - are puzzles. I played the entire game with the controller and it worked perfectly, haven't tried it with a keyboard though and quite frankly I don't want to.Level Design - 9/10:Level Design - or essentially the Puzzles - are all pretty great but most are based on timings and not necessarily using any logic, there are some red herrings with some of the puzzles but generally there are more 'jumping puzzles' than 'actual puzzles'. There are different types of blocks you'll encounter while you progress through the game like Glass, Mirrors, and Broken Blocks that spice it up a little, but I won't go into detail as it is a puzzle platformer after-all. Finally, there are enemies, all of which are pretty stupid, the AI is kind of dumb and mostly set up in way where they are only required to do one action. Don't expect to be doing any combat in this Platformer! The world itself is pretty cool though, coupled with the secrets and collectables it - partially - rewards exploration, I would have liked it if they made exploration more rewarding and beat off the linear path every so often with more easter eggs.Audio - 7/10:The music is pretty great, it's an 8-bit Techno-Sci-Fi style and fits in the game perfectly, the soundtrack of this game is excellent. Unfortunately that's about it though, sound wasn't used as well as it could have been and there's no voice acting with the dialogue...Graphics - 7/10:The graphics, which you can probably gather from the screenshots or from my gameplay footage are a dark, pixel art style, it reminds me of Risk of Rain, whilst I'm not the biggest fan of pixel art - as I normally feel that it's more of the lazy way out of the graphics situation - it does fit in with the game nicely.Overall - 8.0/10:A bloody great platformer that I thoroughly enjoyed playing! If you're a fan of puzzle platformers then Out There Somewhere definitely needs to be in your Steam Library. I completed it in about an 1 and 1/2 hours - but not 100% collectables/achievements. I did feel that it may have been a tad too easy though... I like my Platformers to be challenging!			"

												Really great little game! I was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed it. (Especially the *second* playthrough!)The game starts with the basics of the teleport gun, and introduces more advanced nuances as you go, requiring you to think how to use the environment and your new techniques to overcome platforming ""puzzles"".  Many of them require quick timing, especially the later ones.  By the end of the game, it leaves you feeling very clever, and with a great feeling of accomplishment.And this is what got me super excited when after beating the game I went back and played through a second time, and suddenly realized there were a ton of new areas/secrets that I could now reach. Areas I could have reached all along, if I had only known the techniques before.There is actually still a secret I have yet to be able to reach, as I am playing without looking at any guides. I think I have figured out how to do it, but it requires amazing split-second timed jumps and shots. I'm enjoying the attempt though!Sure, you could blow throw the game in an hour or so, but finding all the secrets and/or trying to get all the achievements adds a lot more value, and replayability.  If you like clever platformers, give it a go! "

The vast majority of the game is simple puzzle platforming with a teleport gun with a small scroll shooter segment at the beginning and end. I understand this is indie and short, but I liked it so much I wish there were more planets and scroll shooter segments to play. You encounter some alien species and a few power-ups for your ship, but it's only for one more shooter segment. I think it would be cool to extend this idea into a larger game with explorable planets and just more of the same fun.I recommend this game because it's great and very fun, but it is short.

												Was on sale for 0.19$ so I kinda felt like I should buy it right?????RIGHT!?!?!?!??The cards are worth about 8-9 cents or so and it has some acheivments so you can get alot out of this.......game? oh right.The game is a platformer that has the retro feel along with a portal gun and a normal gun.......so how long does it last?I played this game and beat it in less then an hour and there is an acheivment for beating it in less then 20 minutes.I hate short games but considering what I paid for it I have no complaints this isnt a bad game.....but it could use artifical gameplay increasers.....like a animation when you load a screen so it isnt so fast and jerky or just more screens.[Update] I think this game is great and pays respect to old games but I feel like it lacks 1 thing......play time.......on the art cover thing for the store page you see some characters that are not even mentiond besides the little dialoug cutscene at the start........I would like them to be unlockable.

It requires some quick reflexes and basic puzzle solving skills but generous checkpoints means it's not too hard or frustrating. Good retro styled graphics and music, and it controls well (I played with a 360 gamepad). Takes about 1-2 hours to beat.

												a short, adorable, little game and it's cheaper than a sandwich.The first thing you'll notice are the cute animated cutscenes. They are fairly short and clickable when you have read the subtext. You then are thrown into a sideways space invader type game with increasingly powerful weapons, ship upgrades, and enemies. This is a sort of trick though because when you get damaged down to one heart, and this won't take long, another cutscene flashes and you end up on a planet. This ground portion is a side view 2D platformer like Starbound or Terraria. Most of the game is this ground portion. You are taught some basics like how to jump and are eventually introduced to a wicked cool teleport gun similiar to Chell's gun in Portal. More games should have portal making abilities. You'd think more people are thinking with portals by this point. I digress. You will use this gun and platforming to complete puzzles. Eventually you will encounter the boss and beat the game, unlike me. I was unable to beat the game because timing things and puzzles usually fill me with rage rather than joy. Also a minor framerate issue. I was consistently getting an unplayable (5 fps) framerate on planet. If this issue happens to you then store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds. <--DON'T ABUSE THIS SYSTEMYou'll love the pixel art and upbeat music. You will bob your upper body and head like a slowly wiggling fish. If you use a gamepad or whatever you will be content. However, if you seek mouse support in menues or in the game you will have to keep seeking. The English, French, and Portuguese languages are available via a toggle in the options menu. The ingame menu is limited so don't expect to change volume or controls outside of the main menu at the start of the game. This game has a unique menu option to show or hide playtime.

												Definitely recommended (whether at full price or at the insane deal I got it - $0.19), especially for fans of modern 8 or 16 bit style platformers like ""Cave Story+"" and ""VVVVVV.""At its core, ""Out There Somewhere"" is a retro platformer (with a brief bullet hell beginning and ending) that hinges on mastering teleportation and your reaction time to it. While it doesn't approach the sadistic difficulty of ""Super Meat Boy,"" for example, you will need to become increasingly agile and plan ahead in each room as the game progresses. While the core game length is shorter than I had hoped, there are a lot of hidden items to try to collect or you can try to best your speedrun time on another run-through.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a 2D platformer game which would have fit right in back on the NES. While the graphics are probably a bit better than what would have been around back then in some places, on the whole this is a pixel graphics game whose gameplay harkens back to a much simpler time.You play Yuri, a space cop in hot pursuit of Grigori, some sort of bad guy. You start out trying to shoot down his ship, fail, and then have to travel across the planet to confront him and collect a light orb to repower your ship and beat him down in the end-game.The game is very simple. It claims to be inspired by Cave Story, Super Metroid, and Portal, but honestly it is its own thing, and not very much like any of those games. It is very linear, there isn’t much of a plot, and it is very centered around its central game mechanic – a teleportation gun.When Yuri fires his gun, he gets teleported to wherever it hits, with whatever momentum he presently has being preserved. He cannot teleport if he is already right next to the surface he would be teleporting to.He can also jump.These two mechanics make up pretty much all of the gameplay in the game. You do eventually get a gun you can kill monsters and destroy certain blocks with partway through the game, which opens up a few more puzzles, but most of the game is centered around platforming with the teleportation gun – including one room towards the end of the game with no platforms in it at all, which the player scales by shooting shots across the room, landing, then jumping just as the shot hits the far wall.The game cost 50 cents on sale, and is extremely short – this is the sort of thing you can beat in a single sit down. I was pretty heavily achievement and secret hunting and beat the game in 89 minutes my first time through. All that’s left at that point is trying to figure out how to acquire the last few secrets, many of which are pretty devious (such as requiring you to go through about a third of the game without saving once so you can die and respawn at the very start with the block-destroying gun, in order to acquire one of the secrets).Was it worth 50 cents and an hour and a half of my time? I can’t say I wasn’t entertained by it, but it wasn’t high-quality entertainment – the game is decent enough as what it is, but it is not exactly aiming for the stars. If you like 2D platformers with simple, straightforward mechanics, this is probably a decent choice for you; if you like nice graphics, complex gameplay, a sophisticated story, or anything else like that, you’ll probably be disappointed by this game.

												Out There Somewhere is a platformer/shooter game in which you find yourself crash landed on a distant planet far from your home world. At first it may seem to be more along the lines of an ""R-Type""-esque scrolling shooter, but that only lasts for a moment. Stranded, you need to find a new power core for your space ship so you may return from being ""Out There Somewhere"".The gameplay is simple to grasp but it has several nuances that require a great deal of practice in order to master. Using the WASD keys you move your character back and forth, and you use the x and c button to shoot your portal gun and use something else found later in the game ( no need to spoil that ). While the controls at first may seem a bit wonky (nor is there an option to remap the keys), with a little time it is not hard to get used to them. Your teleporter gun will be your main mode of transportation and movement. While the game is inspired by Portal, instead of using the one end spits out another end, your teleporter gun changes your location to match where the bullet hits a wall. One of the cool mechanics surrounding this is that your momentum before you teleport is maintained after the teleport, allowing you to jump just before impact to scale walls you normally would not be able to get over.The music in the game is a pleasent albeit repetitive set of chiptunes, each unique area having its own sound. There is an option to turn off the music present in the main settings (along with various in-game sounds). Story is minimal at best, and history is presented through both the visuals and interactions you will have the inhabitants of this planet.Gameplay: 9Music: 8Story: N/AMechanics/Controls: 9Overall: 8.75/10The game itself is very solid although it is very short, at $5 it is definitely worth the look. It also often goes on sale for as low as $0.19, and at that price the game is a must buy for anybody that enjoys platformers (while the trading cards will also cover the price as well).			"

												Great story and fun puzzle playthrough, but here are the things that really bugged me about the game:-Can't go to options while in game, have to save and exit and then you can access them at the main menu.-Doesn't have very good keyboard controls. I had to set my own from the start of the game, but once I got use to it it was fine.-I found the boss fight nearly impossible with keyboard controls because I was trying to dodge things while flying in all directions with arrow keys, and I had to also focus on shooting him with a different button. It would have been much easier with a controler.Besides all of that, it is a great little game, with interesting mecanics and good puzzles that aren't too difficult. For the current sale price of 0.19 cents, it's definitely worth it.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a exploration platformer with a mechanic of teleportation. You control Yuri on his quest to repair his ship and escape the planet he crashed on. Armed with a teleportation gun which allows you to fire a shot and then teleport where it lands, you must use this mechanic to your advantage to progress.This game makes excellent use of its core mechanic. The platforming feels solid and incorporates the telegun very well. The difficulty curve feels right, gradually increasing so the player has to use what they have learned in prior levels in new and different ways. Progressing requires quick reflexes and some thinking, and death isn't a hindrance due to instant-respawn. The aesthetic of the game is great, with pixel visuals, and the chiptune soundtrack adds to the feel. The game is a bit short, however. It took me about an hour of gametime to beat the game on my first run, and it left me wanting more. What the game provides is excellent and leaves me wanting more, which could have easily been added. The final boss felt a little underwhelming and could probably have used the game's mechanics better. Overall, I rate Out There Somewhere a 8/10, on the basis that the game is a bit short.			"

It may only leave you wanting more, as the whole game feels more like a ""first stage"" than a complete game.

												========================================Vince Rowe ReviewsSaving the Industry one Game at a Time![YouTube Link]  [Curation Link]  ========================================An amazing little puzzle platformer coupled with great 8-bit music and good old fashioned collectables!Verdict - 8.0/10Scroll to the bottom for an 'Overall' on the game.Gameplay - 9/10:Out There Somewhere starts off as a side-scroller shooter that you're pretty much destined to lose causing you to crash down to the planet below - this is where the real game begins. It's a pretty simple platformer but the twist is the teleport gun you get, it shoots like an ordinary gun and you'll be teleported to where it hits instantly with all of your momentum preserved. It flows really well making the movement of the game extremely fluid. You also get a 'Guass Gun' which is basically just a pew pew that kills enemies and breaks blocks. There are a few NPCs with a little bit of inane dialogue, and collectables littered across the landscape which - a majority of them - are puzzles. I played the entire game with the controller and it worked perfectly, haven't tried it with a keyboard though and quite frankly I don't want to.Level Design - 9/10:Level Design - or essentially the Puzzles - are all pretty great but most are based on timings and not necessarily using any logic, there are some red herrings with some of the puzzles but generally there are more 'jumping puzzles' than 'actual puzzles'. There are different types of blocks you'll encounter while you progress through the game like Glass, Mirrors, and Broken Blocks that spice it up a little, but I won't go into detail as it is a puzzle platformer after-all. Finally, there are enemies, all of which are pretty stupid, the AI is kind of dumb and mostly set up in way where they are only required to do one action. Don't expect to be doing any combat in this Platformer! The world itself is pretty cool though, coupled with the secrets and collectables it - partially - rewards exploration, I would have liked it if they made exploration more rewarding and beat off the linear path every so often with more easter eggs.Audio - 7/10:The music is pretty great, it's an 8-bit Techno-Sci-Fi style and fits in the game perfectly, the soundtrack of this game is excellent. Unfortunately that's about it though, sound wasn't used as well as it could have been and there's no voice acting with the dialogue...Graphics - 7/10:The graphics, which you can probably gather from the screenshots or from my gameplay footage are a dark, pixel art style, it reminds me of Risk of Rain, whilst I'm not the biggest fan of pixel art - as I normally feel that it's more of the lazy way out of the graphics situation - it does fit in with the game nicely.Overall - 8.0/10:A bloody great platformer that I thoroughly enjoyed playing! If you're a fan of puzzle platformers then Out There Somewhere definitely needs to be in your Steam Library. I completed it in about an 1 and 1/2 hours - but not 100% collectables/achievements. I did feel that it may have been a tad too easy though... I like my Platformers to be challenging!			"

												Fantastic, but short, puzzle-platforming game. The primary mechanic is your telegun, whose bullets don't hurt enemies but do instantly teleport you to whatever surface they hit. The devs manage to stretch this mechanic quite a bit and create a few very tricky rooms. Art is just pixel art, but it's very good pixel art, and the music is stellar; overall, the alien atmosphere feels very well-fleshed-out. My main complaint is that this is not a Metroidvania game, as the inspirations it lists on the store page would imply; there are a couple heart containers and ship upgrades, but the latter are pretty useless and the game itself is basically linear. Rather than drawing in fans of Super Metroid or Cave Story, I think people who enjoyed VVVVVV would be the most likely to have fun with Out There Somewhere. Again, it's short: my first run through the game took about 50 minutes. Though, it's a good bit longer if you're a completionist, since getting all the achievements was about 3 hours total without a guide. Plus, if you're of the speedrunning type, then the telejump mechanic offers a lot of potential there. The game's only $2 at full price and gets even cheaper in sales and with various bundles, so if you happen to see it it's definitely worth picking up.			"

												Really great little game! I was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed it. (Especially the *second* playthrough!)The game starts with the basics of the teleport gun, and introduces more advanced nuances as you go, requiring you to think how to use the environment and your new techniques to overcome platforming ""puzzles"".  Many of them require quick timing, especially the later ones.  By the end of the game, it leaves you feeling very clever, and with a great feeling of accomplishment.And this is what got me super excited when after beating the game I went back and played through a second time, and suddenly realized there were a ton of new areas/secrets that I could now reach. Areas I could have reached all along, if I had only known the techniques before.There is actually still a secret I have yet to be able to reach, as I am playing without looking at any guides. I think I have figured out how to do it, but it requires amazing split-second timed jumps and shots. I'm enjoying the attempt though!Sure, you could blow throw the game in an hour or so, but finding all the secrets and/or trying to get all the achievements adds a lot more value, and replayability.  If you like clever platformers, give it a go! "

												Definitely worth checking out if you like the metroidvania style. The teleport puzzle mechanic is used perfectly, progressively getting more difficult without becoming frustrating or wearing itself out. The pixel art is detailed and music is fantastic, the levels felt alive as I was going through them. The only downside to this game is that it's very short. You'll get about an hour out of the campaign and I recommend going after the achievements as they'll give you a few more playthroughs.			"

Wasn't expecting much from the other games because retro platformers have been done to death and aren't really my thing.  To my surprise, this game turned out to be the real reason to buy the bundle.  It is stylin'.  Mechanically, it's like a 2D Portal with a little metroidvania and bullet hell thrown in.  It's short, but highly challenging and satisfying, with enough hidden goodies to make it worth doing an achievement run after clearing it once.			"

												(8/10)Cute little game thats a fusion of the various games it mentions in its blurb.  The music/graphics are very reminiscent of cave story, as are the very tight controls.  The main game is an exploratory metroidvania style, with a few secrets and some definite portalish puzzle solving.The various elements gel very well together and the overall play was fun and engaging, while it lasted.  I'm not normally a 'time snob' but it definitely felt like the game was over all too soon.  Aiding that was the notion that there was never really a chance to go back and grab all those secrets you saw glimpses of earlier.  If you miss it, odds are, you missed it, and thats that.I may actually do a second walkthrough enhanced run just to see what effects some of the last things i didn't do would have, but as it stands if you mostly just do forward progress you can probably beat it in just an hour or two.  (some kinda plus mode, or just some oportunity to 'turn back' at the end so you could finish collecting would have been appreciated).As it stands though I did like it, and did have fun, and would reccomend it specifically to cave story fans who also like puzzle games because more than anything else this is a great fusion of those two styles.

												This is a 2D-puzzle platformer. And a bloody good one at that. It contains a sort of portal gun. The puzzles are not very easy but not to hard either. There are also quite the amount of secrets to find in this game. It is a lovely little game. You can however beat the campaign in about an hour and a half. The game gets a lot longer once you try to get 100% on the achievements. I got the full 100% now in about 9 hours and trust me that's not an amazing achievement, it is just that short. And the time added to the game is mostly just artificially added to the game. Not actual gameplay, just a lot of things you have to do a certain way that a lot of time to the game. So, lovely little puzzle game but short.Final conclusion: If you get this game for the full price off 5 euro you might be paying a bit too much. But if you're one of the people like me who bout it for 0,19 euro you have paid way to little for this fun game :D			"

												Ignore anyone saying this is not a good game, For they are F4GG0T5.Great little platformer harkening back to the days of commander keen, cave story and other similar otherwordly 2d jump and fight festivals.Really nice mechanics, smooth and fair gameplay and some puzzles that (while not being particularly challenging) are interesting and fun enough to keep you interested until the end. It is NOT a long game but I think this almost works in its favour. I think something like this would get irksome/annoying if they focused much more on timed jumping and awkward, multi-stage puzzles which I suppose they'd have to do to ramp up the difficulty any further.As it is the challenge is pleasant, it's fun to look for the extra secrets and (I thought) the game had a nice atmosphere. Perhaps it's not everyones cup of tea and if you're a resolutely modern (F4G1T) gamer then this might not please you but if you like to do more with your gaming time than endless games of CS:GO whilst pulling at your pants and screaming obscenities down the mic then this might well be something you'll enjoy.I was gifted the game but I believe it was really cheap lately and would definitely have been worth that price but I'd say, also, that at full price it's still a worthwhile investment. There's a fair chunk of replayability and I think it's sensible to support people making games like this as it's the textbook definition (to me) of ""A fun game"". There are just under 1000 games in my steam library, 90% of which I have NEVER played. I played this solidly until completion.Then I completed it again.10/10 kept my mind busy and gave me no desire to pull at my pants or scream down a microphone. It doesn't even HAVE mic support.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a simple as well as simply priced game on Steam with a lots of detail added in such a short little space adventure.  While it is short in stature, it makes up for it with the quality put into the the low price, sprite-work, and the gameplay.  The game itself costs two dollars on Steam, so it is very unlikely you will regret your purchase with all of the fibers of your wallet if you dislike it, unless of course those two dollars were needed to save you from dying of hunger. Of course, there is a chance one might receive a coupon for it upon crafting a badge or something, further decreasing the affordable price.  The sprites give off a very solid Metroid reminiscence, which is fair because the game was reportedly inspired by Super Metroid.  Each of the environments are tailored almost exclusively with each screen that your character passes through.  They may have an underlying theme to it all, be it uncharted wasteland to menacing metal, but they all have something unique in level design incorporated within the game.  The game is built around a teleportation mechanic.   A specially designed gun fires a blue bullet that, upon impact with any solid platform, teleports you to that specific location.  The gameplay revolves around you, and how you determine when to fire, not to mention time how long the bullet takes to reach your designated location.  Of course, with all of those pluses, the game itself is rather short.  If you do not go out of your way to find any collectables, (and even if you do) the game boils down to a solid hour or two of total playtime.  Which is a shame, because the teleport gun mechanic is rather fun to play around with.  Another issue I have with the game is the way the levels are organized.  I feel as though game is very linear, each level designed to be a simple obstacle that prevents you from proceeding, so any unique level concepts are used once and left behind.  If one wanted to find the collectables aforementioned, they would have to backtrack through each of the levels that appeared to be designed in mind for separate challenges meant simply for providing something to hop through once and be done with, compared to games like the original Metroid or its remake, Zero Mission where there are several tunnels connected in a sense where you can be familiar with the layout and return without it feeling like you have to return through a single linear stretch.  However, the game is a solid buy through and through.  If you feel like adventuring on an alien planet with a trusty teleportation machine, feel free to buy for a short yet sweet playthrough.			"

It has a really good difficulty curve and you gradually learn more and more complicated moves that use the same basic mechanic. The world is interesting and the soundtrack is top notch. The only downside is that a normal playthrough will only take about an hour. It does have some replay value as there are plenty of hidden items to collect that require some pretty advanced puzzle-solving. I recommend it highly, even though it is a short game.			"

												This will sound like a very strange criticism, but the game is too dark. My IPS monitor is calibrated for accurate colors and brightness and this is the only game where I can't make out what's what. Many tiles are dark violet and are almost indistuingishable from the black background.I could make the monitor brighter, but then I would have to calibrate it back again after I finish the game.Other than that it's a simple metroidvania where each room is a puzzle (or a series of puzzles). But without ruining my screen calibration it's unplayable for me.			"

												Dunno what it is about the game, but i liked it instantly.Must be something about the way the game was designed and presented. It doesn't waste any time with overlong exposure and gets right down to the good stuff, mainly controls, animations and characters. The tiles aren't the prettiest though i wouldn't call the game ugly by any means. Animations and music give it a very good athmosphere.It focuses less on action, combat or powerups, and more on puzzles with a healthy serving of platforming. Climb everything and explore everywhere! It somewhat resembles Cave Story, but with fewer monsters (at least initialy) and less fighting. It has it's share of cutesy aliens and quirky characters, though the stories cannot be compared.The only downside is that there's no difficulty options and that it's not a very long game. I finished it in about an hour, but i enjoyed it. It's not brutaly easy but it's quite forgiving, which could be a good thing if you rage easily.I don't know why you're not playing this game. It's mix of puzzles and platforming requires some skill and feels rewarding. I'll admit that it doesn't look like a winner just by looking at the trailer & screenshots, but it's solid.Yes, recommended.			"

												This game is very interesting.The story is about a space cop who is hunting a villain named Grigori. But after a fight with him, his space ship gets badly damaged and both land on a same planet. Main gameplay begins here and you have to find a light orb to fix your ship and defeat Grigori for good.Gameplay is really nice. you have a teleport gun which is frequently used in the game and nearly all of the puzzles must be solved with it and a gauss gun to kill enemies. After progressing further in the game, you will encounter new enemies, three types of lightbeams, mirrors, breakable objects and moving platforms which add to the challenge.PROS:- Nice gameplay- Great soundtrack- Collectables affect how much hard the last fight will be- Can 100% the game easily with a little skill and patienceCONS:- Short (Can be completed in 14 mins to 75 mins on first playthrough)- You HAVE to lose in the first encounter with Grigori and you can even lose at the beginning; but it's not clear. So you do your best to take him down and after a lot of minutes you find out it was a complete waste of time.- Some rare achivement problems: One of the achievement did not unlock until I did it's required action for the third time.VERDICT:This game is really nice and definitely worths trying but it's short and after you unlock every achievement, you may not want to play it anymore.

												Not bad, but not memorable. The teleporting mechanic itself is unique, but the overall game feels all too familiar for those who played many puzzle-platformers. If you haven't played a lot of games from this genre, it may seem all new and exciting to you, but there are gems out there, somewhere, that deserve more your attention; if you are a veteran, I recommand it if you can never get enough of this kind of game. I had a fun ride, but I will probably forget this game in a few weeks, especially since it's so short. I gave a positive review because I had a nice experience, but I would give a neutral review if possible since you have to consider everything above to determine whether or not it's worth it.			"

												This is a short but excellent puzzle platforming adventure. It takes about the length of time a ""chapter"" might take in a longer game, so somewhere in the ballpark of an hour if you're going at a relaxed, casual pace. (There is an achievement for 20-minute completion for speedrunners.)Figuring out how to use the teleportation gun to solve each room---as well as discover secrets for the more observant---is very satisfying both to solve and to execute.There isn't much of a story here, but I don't think you'll care about that too much. What the game lacks in story, it makes up for in charm and style. It definitely has that nice Cave Story / Metroid kinda vibe that SNES era kids will love.I also got it on sale for NINETEEN CENTS?!

												Oh, this game. Let's think this game first. This game is really hard, really annoying and really frustrating.  Teleport laser is very hard to handle, because later on the game, you need to do double jump with teleport gun and take like 5 minutes to pass one double jump sections. Also this game have so many dead traps. I ragequit several times during this game, because that stupid teleport laser. But I still recommend this game? Why?  Music is kinda good, maybe sometimes annoying, but good. Levels are well done, expect double jumping. Story is also pretty good (I haven't finish game before this review). Pros:+ Good music+ Nice level design+ Very low cost (19 cents)+ Story+ Aliens look hilariousCons:- Rage game elements- Teleport Gun- Double Jumping- Hard platformingI bought this game from sale.

												The game is quite interesting i have to say! - it really reminds me from a different game - i can't come up with the name for now - maybe later.However it still plays differently. you start with a ship - and it is some sort of ""asteroids game""  - eventually you will lose and u will crash - - you have to find the missing parts of the ship. You have a teleport gun - if u shoot - there will be a projectile flying - which will let you teleport if hit to a wall. the game could be quite difficult too and with there puzzles. You also need intelligence and quick thinking in order to pass some area's.There are save stations/checkpoints throughout the level.It is also a little bit of ""metroidvania"" that u have to go back point to point to do somethimg. but so far i know - you do not have a map which COULD be dissappointingthe music is quite ok - it is 2D side scrolling 8 bit graphic style.monsters will respawn if u left the screen - the sound affects ""from guns, exploding, deaths, etc"" are a little bit cheap - i mean, its a very very old sound effect.You can play with an xbox controller. Which actually plays better then on keyboardDefault keyboard controls are weird. Z to teleport. X to jump. C to shoot. I think C should be jumping, Z to teleport and X to shoot.You can heal at checkpoints.THE GAME IS OK BUT SHORT! to make teleport useful - i do recommend using small hops, so that u can jump again once the projectile hit and u fly higher.I give this a 6/10			"

The teleportation gun is an interesting mechanic, and has a lot of potential, but I just don't care enough to go slogging through the rest of the game to get to this theoretical point of interest.The story may as well not be there, as it does nothing to intrigue the player beyond giving a background to the puzzles to come.I don't recommend this game unless you have a keen interest in 2d puzzle platformers, as well as a lack of interest in compelling story telling.

Out there somewhere is a very cheap platformer game, and in this case you get nothing more than what you paid for. A bland, uninspired jumpfest. The game consists of you having to perform tricky jump after tricky jump until the end credits roll. Out there somewhere claims to be ""Inspired by Cave Story, Super Metroid, and Portal,"" I don't see it - at all. I'd call it a lie in an attempt to boost sales, but there's nothing wrong with saying what inspired you, I guess. A satanic death metal band could claim the inspiration for their latest album was the Beatles' white album, even though you'd never actually hear that influence in any of their music.Apparently, if you're good at this sort of game, you'll finish Out there somewhere in less than an hour and are entitled to some bragging, for example in the form of the Steam Achievement for finishing the game. If you're not particularly good at this sort of game, you'll notice they managed to make 'Out there somewhere' very challenging (difficult) but forgot to add any fun or wonder to the gameplay, which would motivate to try and finish it anyway.All in all, Out there somewhere  is a below average platformer that's only for the die-hard platformer gamer who's looking for a quick but extremely difficult fix.

												This game was very good, however there a few things to note if you wnat to get it, i spent about 5 1/2 doing puzzles to beat this game, then a faught a boss using some of the skills i learned before, then i faught a space ship using absoultly no prior skills after spending 5 1/2 hours i had to fight in an new way that was way to difficulthowever if your stuck on the last boss, the best way to win is use a controller,also mash the fire button so you shoot faster, i failed my first 30+ tries and won my first try with a controlleroverall this is a fantastic puzzle game however there is no point to collecting cores, once you get them all you need to backtrack to some dude to upgrade them? waste of time			"

												Bought the game for 19 cents, played it for an hour and beat it, sold the trading cards for 20 cents. Pretty fun game, would get paid 1 cent to play it again.It's a short game but the platforming is quite fun. The teleport gun is a clever mechanic and the game makes good use of it with some fair but challenging sections. After I beat it once I was still motivated enough to replay it several more times for full completion. Definitely a worthwhile purchase.			"

												MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOWThis game isn't long, but that doesn't matter, because it is a well-constructed game.  Initially, you begin with a side-scrolling space-shooter sequence that takes you through an army of rival space ships.  After the initial boss fight (which you are supposed to lose), you begin exploring a planet armed initially with only a portal gun.  You'll find an actual weapon later on to fight enemies with and to help with solving puzzles.The game is basically an action-platformer in the vein of games like Metroid with its exploration for various items, including extenders to your life meter and components which can power-up your repaired ship at the end of the game.  There aren't a whole lot of mechanics to the game, which is fitting for its short length.  This also makes the game easy to pick up and play.  There is a good challenge to the later sections, but there is nothing that truly feels overwhelming or unfair, which is a testament to the overall game design.  The price is fair as there is replayability to earn achievements.  For such a short title, there is a fairly large number to attain, and I can see people earning all of them with lots of practice.I can find very little to criticize about this game.  You do have to be careful of scene switches because you can walk and/or jump into a hazard without fully realizing it, similar to Castle in the Darkness, though not nearly as unfair as in the latter title.  Also, in some of the vertical sections, I had to stop and search for my character, who was just about as far down the screen as possible, usually in a corner!  A brief, flashing arrow pointing to your character would help here, but this is not a big criticism.  It's possible to solve every room on the first try if you're observant and careful; I can even see a few people maybe having a deathless run on the first playthrough.Out There Somewhere has just the right length for casual gamers while being robust enough for those looking for a challenge, especially those seeking to 100% the game through both winning and through completing the achievements.  I highly recommend this game.  It is both well-crafted and extremely well balanced.  Buy it!9.0 / 10			"

												Kind of like a 2D Portal. It has fun platforming with a unique twist, while still being a challenge. You use a portal gun to propel yourself higher and make jumps that would make Mario jealous. Colorful world and great graphics, it fits in nicely with the space theme. It can get tedious at times, but once you get the mechanics down you'll be swinging in no time. The music is great and goes well with the rest of the game. Overall a very fun challenge that will give your fingers a workout. Definately worth two dollars.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a clever game that's just all around quite humble and enjoyable to play. The platforming handles well, there's little secret areas throughout that still feel rewarding to find yet aren't too impossibly hidden, and it's got a short and sweet story. Game runs a little short (only took a few hours to 100% all the achievements), but the satisfaction from finishing the game justifies the price.			"

												Very nice platformer with an interesting game mechanic.You play as a captain of a space ship who ends up in a fight with a villain named Grigori (who is still out there somewhere btw)It result in your ship crashing on some alien planet. Now you have to find your way through the planet to get a light orb to fix your spaceship (Every spaceship needs light orbs cause you know... reasons...) and optionally collecting ""abandoned cores"". You have a teleport gun which teleports you to where the shot lands... a cool game mechanic that is very well implemented.Pros:-Figuring out how to get to the end of every screen is a lot of fun.-Timing and thought required make it enjoyable.-Short but not too short.-Tight controls.-Good soundtrack.-Good-looking pixel graphics.Cons:-Almost no story. (doesn't really matter for this kind of game ... use your Imagination)Highly Recommended!			"

Static screens, tricky but not impossible jumping puzzles, and kickass chiptune music.Don't be fooled by the absolutely horrid SHMUP opening - this is one of the better indie platformers of 2016, and at a VERY reasonable price, to boot. It harkens back to an era of Steam where indie games weren't all overpriced Early Access games or tedious RPGMaker clones.			"

												Basically, it's a demo.  The game has unique gameplay elements and all; but it's extremely short and linear, running you through a token tutorial for about 20 minutes to show off the engine.  Think like the Final Fantasy 8 demo being released as a full game, or if Super Metroid ended when you beat the Bomb Torizo.Really not a lot of thought put into it.  Glaringly little thought put into world and scenario.			"

												I normally try to make well-written reviews, but due to this game's slow performance I'm not even able to play it.I got it on a sale really cheap, so I don't really mind wasting a couple coins in it, but the hardware requirements this game has written are totally false, my computer meets them but the game still runs horribly slow.The worse part is that the game doesn't even have complex graphics, I'm able to run games like OpenArena, Minecraft and other games at 60 FPS at some points, this games goes like at 5 FPS and the graphics are just horrible simple.Also, the game lacks options to disable graphic effects or anything else, the only graphic option is to toggle fullscreen.

												This game was so promising, and I sat down expecting a sweet metroidvania style platform puzzler. I played it for 30 minutes, and took a break to get some food. Then I sat down again and realized I was just outside the chamber of the first boss. ""Great"", I thought, a boss battle is always nice. So I went ahead and defeated the boss in about five minutes. Then the game ended... WHAT!? 35 minutes of gameplay, and ONE boss? Really?I realize this game is only 5€, and you can't expect much from a game that cheap, but still, 35 minutes of content just isn't enough for me to recommend this game.If you still need to kill half an hour and like platform puzzlers with a wee bit of skill needed, then by all means, this game is for you.

												*Extremely minor spoiler alert.*I really wanted to like this game.  However, 2 minutes into the game you'll face an unbeatable boss.  I learned this after another 5 minutes of mashing the fire button and dodging attacks.  I didn't even get to the real game, and now I don't even want to.Devs, if you want to blow up my ship, that's fine.  Make it a scripted event, or give the enemy an unavoidable attack.  Don't waste my time, and don't make me do something that feels stupid.  Having to intentionally destroy my ship completely breaks immersion and removes all my motivation for continuing.			"

												It's a lovely little game rather let down by the developer getting FAR FAR too interested in how fiddly and precise they could make some of the platforming.The teleport gun is an interesting idea but it's just a BIT too fiddly and a BIT too depenent on precision (luck) to be any fun.Some people will like that but I found it tiresome - a lot of the time you'll get through stuff as much by repetition as skill - I just lost interest...

												Even at the cost of 0.21 ( I bought it on a 96 % sale) this game is hardly worth it.  Poor game design overall.  The first phase of the final boss has no challenge and is just plain simple while the second half is more fun but lasted only 15 seconds....When you start the game, you're in a ship and you fight an ennemy boss ship that looks like it's taking damage from your shots BUT NO, you actually have to commit suicide for the game to begin.  So, I lasted 5 minutes shooting an invincible boss while dodging his bullets, laser and missiles until my friend told me I HAD TO DIE for the game to begin.  This is wrong on so many levels...  Also, during the entire game, never once have I been puzzled by a certain room and I finished the game in 42 minutes (playtime).  This is not worth more than 21 centsThe only thing redeeming this game  is the soundtrack and the pixel art...			"

												Inititally, upon starting Out There Somewhere, I was skeptical. Another pixel art puzzle platformer. But the game started to grow on me, the art style was pleasant, and the music is surprisngly well done. The mechanics of the game are simple, but fun and intuitive. The gameplay revolves around a gun which, when fired, fires a bolt which you teleport to when it collides with something. The puzzles designed around this are quite clever, and the game introduces more puzzle mechanics that spice up an already interesting style. It was getting interesting. And just as I felt as though the game was going to advance into something better, it ended. Now, I purchased this game for twenty cents, but it runs for five dollars normally. And because of this, I ultimately cannot recommend Out There Somewhere, as the game time is abyssmally short for the asking price, and honestly left me dissatisfied. I was able to beat the game in under an hour and a half. That sucks. The gameplay itself is enjoyable, but it feels more like a Flash game in the end.			"

												I can't beat the level ""strange formations"" because the jump is not possible. Now you might say, well I am just bad. Sure I'd say the same if I wouldn't have tried to do this jump for over 2 hours now with every possible guide. They all do a 2 high jump, portal shot on wall and than JUMP AGAIN!! which doesn't work. No matter how I time it. It simply doesn't. I have a gaming PC with gaming keyboard and also an xbox 360 controller. I tested everything including rebinding keys on keyboard and/or controller. It's not working to make the wall jump. I play a lot of hard games and jump games and I simply know when I'm just to bad. This jump doesn't work for some reason. Only reason could be a bug.			"

												I’m still on the fence with this game, but I can not bring myself to play it anymore. It teases with the start being a classic arcade space scroller, but instantly turns into a puzzle platformer. Non of that is bad, it just threw me right from the start and made me crave a style of game that I wasn’t going to receive for a long time. The sorry excuse for puzzles and the interesting weapon/ game mechanics are the only thing that almost save this game, but in the end the tediousness of the controls and gameplay force it into the bad game category. It is an interesting concept, but one that was poorly executed. If you like slow games that are solely based on timing, this is for you.			"

No story text popped up, no hints, nothing. ""Okay, maybe there's not supposed to be anything here."" I play around with the controls and learn them, since my escape button doesnt work. Controls learned, time to move on. I go to the right, since nothing is blocking my way, and nothing happens. Screen doesnt change to the next area or anything. ""This is really, really weird. Let me restart the game."" Alright, restarted the game and it puts me on the planet, just after Galaga. I get story text and hints this time, and my escape button works! Awesome. I move right, and then the screen changes. Fantastic! Game is going good...until I have to shoot my teleport gun. ""What the heck?"" I press X multiple times and no response. ""Dangit. Gotta restart again."" Restart game, game works in all aspects. Gameplay was alright, I guess.

Let me restart the game."" Alright, restarted the game and it puts me on the planet, just after Galaga. I get story text and hints this time, and my escape button works! Awesome. I move right, and then the screen changes. Fantastic! Game is going good...until I have to shoot my teleport gun. ""What the heck?"" I press X multiple times and no response. ""Dangit. Gotta restart again."" Restart game, game works in all aspects. Gameplay was alright, I guess. I think it tried to be too much like Risk of Rain, a game I highly reccomend, in both the controls and the overall feel of the game.  But for the technical problems I had, I cant reccomend Out There Somewhere.			"

												This platform game includes some new stuff, such as teleporting. Still, the music and design doesn't make it very attractive and it's way too short, you can finish it within 1 hour without problems once you get used to jump with the teleporting thing. I guess it's fine for platform lovers, but I wouldn't buy it again, not even in sales, as it's not really interactive.			"

												Too short and linear to call Super Metroid and Cave Story influences. It's actually drawing more from Portal.Solid idea, way too short for a $5 game. You will complete it in under 1 hour.Go get Axiom Verge if you want a Metroid experience on PC.Really this game is undeservign of a Metroidvania tag and is total trash in that regard. If you want a 45-min 2D portal game this is it.			"

												It really hurts me to not recommend this game...Because when you look at it, it is very pretty, the gameplay is smooth, and all the art design (atmosphere, sounds, story...) is very nice and thought.But... it is much too short, and quite unsatisfying in terms of experience. It is definitely a flaw in games these years, although some others would argue it is a plus. Yet for me, such a small contribution in terms of entertainment and gaming is exactly like with toys and games... a diminished version, a raw skeleton without any flesh or organs.In other words? The type of gamer I am can not feel fully satisfied with what feels like a demo, like a ""short story"" of a gameplay mechanic. Please realize I am not asking for a 100hours long rpg, but this ""little gamish piece of art"" would have been great if there was more substance to it, more body. As is, I feel sorry to say that I can not recommend it...			"

												This game is for those interested in speedrunning, looking at what your indie project could become, or a literal example of many game design teachings that stick out like a sore thumb. I would say that this game has its moments, but really, the game does nothing much to make itself have moments of impact.It's a metroidvania game that lacks bosses, powerups, or smart puzzles that offer diversity over difficulty. You'll get tired of it unless you enjoy games like the Witness for its puzzles alone. There's no climax other than getting minor upgrades or entering your ship for the final boss. There's no control of pacing aside from locking off features to your character. A new game+ mode would've really helped, where it lets you explore the game world past the final boss considering how the map makes a complete circuit but the game decides to be far too linear, and for that I think it fails.It's a short combination of megaman and portal without the gripping soundtrack, hardcore gameplay, or unique narrative. If you're a sucker for gameplay that doesn't dip in quality, then sure, pick this game up for the dollar (or 25 cents) it's worth. You get it's full worth for what you pay. It's a short, but mildly sweet experience. It's got cute character designs, neat gameplay designs, but when it comes to anything more than puzzle solving and waiting for monster cycles, it falls short. On the plus side, it's short, and easy to speedrun with the in-game timer mechanic.As far as minimally priced games go, this is one of the better ones, but you could always save up your money for a fantastic 10 dollar game over the short-lived ""experience"" of this one.

A little bit demanding, but for experienced players shouldn't be too difficult. Controls feel very smooth. The only disadvantage is that it is short, but what would you expect from 1$ game.Conclusion: If you're low on cash, sell some cards and get it for 0,20$ on sale, if not just buy it, definitely recommended!

When an evil space warlord threatens mother planet, it's up to one ace pilot to take him down!  Until he fails and gets shot down to the surface.A puzzle platformer bookended with shoot-em-up gameplay turns out to be a enjoyable combination.  The well designed levels slowly ramp up the difficulty while teaching players new tricks to handle the growing complexity.  While not the longest game, it's paced well to not overstay it's welcome and leave a positive aftertaste.			"

Its a fairly cheap game with a great art style (altough a bit over saturated) and nice chip tune music this game is a phenominal game and I highly recomend this to anyone.			"

												A cute little platformer that reminds me of a 2D Portal. There's a lot going on here for the price. The game has a nice ramping difficulty, but none of the puzzles get so insane you won't be able to solve them. The soundtrack is awesome, and the artstyle is new-age retro, which is definitely up my alley. The combat (while not a major focus of the game) feels a little clunky, and there are some sections that seem like filler (not intutive level design) but a solid game overall.			"

												Platformer= Anger, sure I get it. :(  Warning: You'll need to watch a walkthrough or find a forum post  I've gotten stuck twice. Which isn't bad in itsef. The first time I was given a hint I didn't read, my bad. The second time on ""mirror wall"" there's no real hint on how to get past the puzzle. Finding the forum post get's harder with a title like ""mirror wall"", and finding a youtube video is even worse, as you have to watch like minutes to an hour to find the part you are stuck on.  :(    ControlsOn my Xbox controller there's a little lagg. This doesn't help with the precision the game requires. I have to wait .25 to jump. When preforming a teleport jump, I have to time this, I died a lot until I got the timing right. :) Basic gameplay Smooth, when working. The teleport gun works. Shooting and teleporting are very amazing. :) Level DesignIt's an amazing world. :) ArtThe reasson I bought this game. It's amazing. From enviroment to character, it's really some great pixel art work. Get it on sale. I did.    "

												Disappointing. Being on-boarded to a game with a spammy splash-screen is NOT a good indication of things to come. The actual mechanic was interesting and accessable, though I--a not-great player of games--finished in about an hour. I was narrating while playing, too, and demonstrating, so actual gameplay is probably closer to 45 minutes for a good player. I probably won't go back and 100% the achievements. It's just not worth it to me, so that is telling.Is this game worth it on sale? Yes. Is this game worth it full price? Not for me, but probably for most people. Just bear in mind that you're paying for around an hour's worth of entertainment, and this is a one-shot deal as there is no procedural generation at work here.			"

												I've tried several gamepads that do not work with the game, as in if they are plugged in, you won't be able to play the game at all. Down is up, and right is always being held. 3 different gamepads, Logitech, Xbox360, and EX3 which is a generic controller similar to a PS controller. All experience the same issue.You would think basic controller support would be something a game would have, and out of the 60 games in my Steam library, this is the first one that I've had this issue. I can't recommend a platformer that doesn't have regular controller input support.You can read more about this issue here, any while I tried the suggestions, there is no resolve, and it should be something the devs fix:https://steamcommunity.com/app/263980/discussions/0/611704531884414739/ "

												Well, the first thing that met me when I started the game was a screen that wanted me to fill in an email address to get a 'free game', and the launch screen for Out There Somewhere didn't even start before I submitted an address. Then my antivirus gave an alarm about identity theft. After I let the antivirus fix the problem, the game itself finally started.The game itself is kinda nice, with innovative mechanics, but anyone trying to play this without some anti virus protection installed is probably royally screwed. Hence, I really, REALLY can't recommend it.An hour after I stopped playing it, the anti virus went off again. The game still tries to do something illegal in the background.Well, at least I got it for 0.02 euro.			"

												Very good platformer. Its about 1.5 -2 hours long and 5 bucks so 2.50 an hour. Pretty good deal. (Unless you got it for .19 cents like i did making it a GREAT deal) Now so you know the next bit will have watered down spoilers if you dont want to see then just know that this game is a good purchase. OK Now heres the few things I found in the game that made me want to write this review.1. How long was this guy waiting to use this teleport gun I mean seriously.2. Gish?3. zubat4. The final Boss comments:            -This is pretty hard            - This is actually a decent boss            - These shots are hard to dodge            - I keep pressing the wrong button and dying ... (Like literally 90% of the time)            -looks like thats gonna hit m- did that just miss me...R U KIDDING ME. IF YOU JUST STAND STILL THE SHOTS WILL MISS YOU            -easiest boss ever5. THATS WHERE THE 11th CORE WAS THE WHOLE TIME?!?!? I CANT EVEN GO BACK AND GET IT?!?!? WHY DEVELOPERS? WHY6.The actual final boss comments            -Binding of Issac skillz come thru!!!            -Okay lets, lets try again            -well all of my left fingers have fallen off            -""sis can u press the x button really fast for me while I dodge?""7.

												A short, but entertaining retro puzzle platformer.Actually it has retro graphic, which I dislike, but the fun gameplay mechanic - jumping, shooting, teleporting to solve puzzles make up for it. The gameplay basically is a platformer where you have to go through multiple rooms containing threats like aliens and lavas by utilizing your teleport gun and pistol. Some thinking and some fasthand are required, though it's not frustrating or hard like Super Meat Boy.Chiptune music is cheesy, but it's alright.It's in-arguably a bit short, though. Some people even have beaten the game in ten minutes or so, I did it in one hour. Well, forgive me. Game runs fine in my toaster laptop, 60 FPS straight.Controller support sucks, but at least I can remap my Dinput based controller F310 Logitech. It also has Steam Achievements (incentives for people who want to replay the game) and Trading Cards, good value overall.96% off at the moment - 0.20 USD equivalent, well worth every penny.Definitely recommended.

												A true Diamond in the rough.  With all of the nonsense getting through greenlight recently, it is nice to see an intelligent platformer that tests both your mind and dexterity skills, whilst managing a simple 'find the engine part' scenario after getting trapped on an unknown planet.  Things are kept nice and easy to begin with, but soon become more challenging as the game progresses.  Platforming is the genre type and the game benefits from responsive controls, good collision detection and audio feedback.Graphically - Nothing brilliant, but a competent throwback to the 8/16-bit days of the 90'sSound - Simple effects.  Nothing obnoxious - Once again, 8-bit styled around the PC engine eraDo I recommend?  I bought this for 19p on a sale and I have to tell you, it was a steal!  If you can get it for around £1 ($1.70) or less, you'll have a great little budget gem worthy of any retro-style platforming fan out there			"

												Well, the first thing that met me when I started the game was a screen that wanted me to fill in an email address to get a 'free game', and the launch screen for Out There Somewhere didn't even start before I submitted an address. Then my antivirus gave an alarm about identity theft. After I let the antivirus fix the problem, the game itself finally started.The game itself is kinda nice, with innovative mechanics, but anyone trying to play this without some anti virus protection installed is probably royally screwed. Hence, I really, REALLY can't recommend it.An hour after I stopped playing it, the anti virus went off again. The game still tries to do something illegal in the background.Well, at least I got it for 0.02 euro.			"

(Don't be fooled by the reccomendation rating! This is in no way a game I, personally, can say for sure whether I approve of it or not!)'Out there somewhere' is an ineresting game... I really don't know how, best, to explain it without ruining the experience......lemme try some vague points....High points:-May be tricky your first time through-great emulation of the NES age of gaming-Excellent bit-tune music-Very atmospheric, to the point that it feels like an episode of some sorta sci-fi show-Feels like it was made for a Space-themed Game JamTripping Points-Incredibly short(your first playthrough may take up to an hour, if you're just gunning it, maybe a bit more if you want all the pickups)-Gets stale easily, once you know how to progress-The storyline is simplistic, at best. It was what they were going for, but... I dunno, it just feels off, to me, because I've been playing more story-oriented games.-...feels like it was made for a Space-themed Game Jam.Overall, I can't say I'd reccomend it for those who want something with substance. To those people, save the dollar or so that'd go to this title. For those who like a nice bite-size game that delivers on atmosphere(or you're an achievement junkie who just wants to complete a game's awards as fast as possible), go ahead.			"

												One of the best ""Cheapest games"" I've ever played. Out There Somewhere is an underrated game that's not heard of often and people will look at games such as Out There Somewhere and say something along the lines of: ""This game looks cheap and the price is cheap so it will be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game"" But thats not the case with this game and I was proved wrong. I bought this game under 20p (So that will be something like 30-40 bucks worth) and the game was pretty decent! They did a good job with handling the platformer, retro and puzzles, in a way it made me feel nostalgic.Pros:It has a good amount of content for a game thats under a pound/dollar.The puzzles are a bit thought-provoking but are fairly alright once you know what to doHas good level designs Has a nice soundtrack to it (Love some 8-bit or 16-bit feel or whatever bit it is)Nice artwork Some good enjoyment out of the game (Especially for those who like retro feel, puzzle and sci-fi setting types)Boss fights have a Mega Man type of feel to themNice sound effectsSteam Trading Cards Cons: The ending of the game is predictableThe story is alright at best but it's a basic sort of story Wanted more but again it's a cheap made game that prices itself for under a pound/dollar so I understand thatIf I had to rate this game on a scale out of 1/10 it would be 6/10 I recommend it despite the score I gave it but that's understandable.

Inventive unpretentious 2D platformer6/10 ★★★★★★☆☆☆☆Let's make 2 things clear - I do not fancy platform games (I am not a six-year-old) and I do not long for pixel art graphics (an insult to my GPU). Having said so, Out There Somewhere is both and I can't stop enjoying this game.Gameplay seemlessly joins skills and wits, thanks to one simple, but innovative machanics.This blends nicely to the world and the story, and turns the game into an unpretentious and surprisingly coherent adventure.Graphics is simple but ejoyable pixel art, fitting the the game idea. Audio is ok. This is a bugdet product and does not bring visual fireworks. And thanks to the great mechanics does not need any.Out There Somewhere came to me as a surprise. I did not expect much and, boy, how wasn't I prepared for so much fun!.Summing upWell-executed platformer with inventive gameplaypositive good idea for gameplay, well developed into mechanics good, upretentious execution good, pixel-art graphicsnegative just a 2D platformer  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯A little, budget gem. Highly recommended. "

												Speedrunner with a teleport jumping difficulty curve.(i'm not a big fan of this genre of gaming, so go easy on me. don't take this review to heart)This game goes from simple to annoyingly jumbled with little to no help along the way. Expect to be confused and a little frustrated from the beginning. I think that a more helpful tutorial should of been in place, especially for newer players and people who aren't familiar with speedrunners.Most of the levels are really easy, but a few in between are just plain hard, from jumping and teleporting with miliseconds of error to jumping and dodging enemies while firing teleport shots across the map, it ramps up really fast. You also have to repeat a lot of content if you mess up, which is often due to the quick timing required.Easy game to play, difficult to master.The game is really short, only lasting around 2-3 hours. The game is only 1$. Anyway, this is my short review on this game, I didn't like it but I had to give it a try. I hope this review does not upset you, it is simply my opinion.Personal Rating: 1/5			"

												Do yourself a favor and just get Cave Story.This game is too short and relies on a teleportation projectile for all the puzzles. Which is fine, if it were of any decent length. It can't take itself very seriously. There are mixed pixel ratio issues in some areas. There's only 3 minor enemies if you count the thwomp clones. It ramps up the challenge, but not enough to warrant someone's time or money.			"

												I gave up on final boss as the difficulty spike proved too much for me and I haven't found the game engaging enough to try and overcome it. To the contrary of what it says on the Steam page, this game has nothing to do with Cave Story or Super Metroid. It's just a short puzzle platformer with an interesting mechanic. The teleport gun is fun and there were a couple of interesting puzzles, but overall the experience was unsatisfying.			"

												Uh, are you kidding me? 1 hour of gameplay? Really?! I'm glad I didn't spend a whole lot on this one. To the designer's credit, the game was incredibly fun, despite being incredibly short and linear. The teleportation and platforming puzzles were excellent. The retro cut scenes were hilarious. However, I was hoping that when they said ""inspired by Metroid"" they'd actually have some Metroid-esque RPG elements. No such luck I'm afraid. If you can get this title for less than a dollar, I'd say go for it. At least you get steam cards and an hour of fun. Otherwise, this is a hard pass.			"

												The game is OK, but the lack of custom controls in unbearable. You use left and right arrow keys to move, and then Z & X to jump and shoot. For me it creates a akward flow of movement. You can change the jump and shoot key binds to a very limited number of keys, which still feel awkard. If the added more options, would be a good game.			"

												I'd love to be able to recommend this game as it looks really fun but can't from my own personal experience. My experience is it's not possible to actually play it. I emailed the developers a couple months ago asking for help but haven't heard a thing from them.The problem is that the controls don't work using gamepad or keyboard & mouse. Once the start screen has loaded up, it's like there is a stuck key for pressing left and also up and down are reversed. So after eventually getting the game to load, your character immediately goes left and thats it ! the level is supposed to progress to the right so that screws that up, 2-3 seconds of seeing a sprite move to the left of a level isn't a good game in my books.I have googled the problem and searched forums but found nothing to help. So I'd avoid this game as it will be a gamble paying anything for it.			"

												If you go into this game thinking that it will be a Metroidvania game based off its description you will be dissappointed. It is extremely linear and can be beaten in under an hour on your first playthrough with no prior knowledge of the game. I was only stuck on one of the puzzles for a long time. Art style is alright but nothing to be shocked by, basic chibi pixel. The soundtrack only had a few songs in it and some of them were pretty good. If I had to tell you my favorite part of the game I would say it is the bullet-hell shooters. Unfornately these are short segements at the begining and end of the game. For 2 bucks it is a resonable price, however I could get better games for 2 bucks on a smart phone.			"

												The game lacks any form of tutorial about the teleport mechanic besides vague level names and brief dialogue leaving you to button mash to see what happens.  Very frustrating, especially when looking at guides and reviews that point out that the telejump mechanic works 75% when you do it right and I'm having difficulties trying to replicate what I did in the last room.  Thankfully for me I bought it for 19 cents so I don't feel so bad about ragequiting to go nurse my sore thumb.			"

												Out There Somewhere claims to have been inspired by Cave Story and Super Metroid, but those games raise expectations in my mind that I feel the game did not meet. The game is far shorter than expected, my first playthrough lasting little more than an hour. It is also not nearly as varied as Cave Story and other Metroidvania-style games; you will spend the majority of the game with just your teleport gun and a normal gun. And while the puzzles involving the aforementioned teleport gun are definitely interesting, the claimed inspiritations led me to believe I would have a bigger arsenal at my disposal.Another issue I have with the game is the use of bullet hell-like portions of the game. These sections feel very out of place in a game that is otherwise essentially a 2D version of Portal.Out There Somewhere is a decent game, considering the price, but the tauted inspirations to me implied a set of standards that the game did not deliver. Like I said above, this is 2D Portal. If that is what you want, then this game will do. But if you're looking for something Metroidvania-esque, look elsewhere.			"

												Pros:-Metroidvania with matching art style-Interesting teleporting mechanics with different beams that do different things-Starts difficult, which makes it reminiscent of older games and their difficulty-60FPS?-Good soundtrackCons:-Pits of death. EVERYWHERE. And they're so open that it's hard not to fall in them during a puzzle.-Vertical Platforming that, if you fail one part, you will fall down a screen back to nearly the beginning every time.-Actually, all the puzzles make you restart them in one way or another when you fail one part.-Soundtrack doesn't really match up with the mood of some situations-NPCs are borderline useless to talk to, despite you being consistently encouraged to talk to them-WAY too many tutorials. Every time you see a new beam, the game wants you to know what it is. Every time a pixel on a graphic is shaded differently, the game has to bring up a slow-moving dialogue box to tell you. LET ME FIGURE IT OUT.-Puzzle mechanics are interesting, but they get bland very quickly, so to remedy that something new appears every screen or so in the beginning. This, however, will make the game even more bland in the end because there's way too much involved into the game that it's too complicated and ends up being uninteresting anyways.-Every once in a while I get lag spikes for some reason. I'm running on an Intel i7-4500U with 8GB RAM on Windows 10 (Home Edition) 64-bit. There is absolutely no reason this game should have any lag spikes. Also why does it claim it requires 512MB VRAM on the store page? Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst and Revolution require the same specs and is more graphically demanding in every way I can think of than this game. Also 1GB of RAM does seem like a lot to ask for with this sort of game Possibly unoptimized engine or code? I mean, I'm sure it can run on most machines decently, but if the developers here were working for a publisher for a larger-scale game, it would be unacceptable if they were to make the game require way more resources from the computer than it really should.Conclusion:Not really worth $1.99, you'd be better off paying around half of that for the game, or less.

												About 5minutes into the game, you end up in a dead room. The game fails to explain its own mechanics. Apparently the trick is to jump right before your shot hits the wall (so you end up teleporting and then going into the air). This is a hugely ""trial and error"" mechanic with very little point in mastering it. PROS: -?

												While it is solid in what it does, and it is very much fun to solve how to progress some of the levels (or maps if you want so), The game lenght is so short, it's unreal. 4,99€ doesn't seem much at first, but I just beat it the first time I booted it up in 70 minutes.

												I literally beat this game in 54 minutes. When I beat the first boss (the only boss) the credits rolled and I thought the developers were making a joke. This is probably the shortest game I have ever played, and I was greatly disappointed by that. This game describes itself as taking the pages out of Super Metroid and Cave Story, both very long games with enormous worlds to explore, but this game is nothing like them at all. It's a shame, because what is in the game is awesome. Everything is built just right and it's something new I've never encountered before. But, this game is virtually a tech demo of what should have been a much more expansive game. If the developers made a sequel to this I'd buy it in a heartbeat, but this game by itself just isn't long enough to merit a purchase at its listed retail price.			"

												This game is ok, but I have a few problems-1. The keys are so dumb. jump is z. Like what even. You can rebind them, but not to something sensible like up or space.2. The levels are repetetive. I'm already bored with the art style and level design3. The game brings nothing new. If you're looking for a retro platformer, look elsewhere. The classics are far better than this. Shovel knight did it right, but this has a lame story, dull characters, and nonexistanct plot.4. Did I mention that the levels are repetative?5. I beat the game in under an hour. I'm no speedrunner either. It's certainly not worth $5. You'd be better off playing some flash games.The soundtrack is pretty good though, but I mean, isn't that expected of modern retro games by now?tl;dr- Repetetive, frustrating, and terrible keybinding that you can't use up or space in. Brings nothing new to the genre.(I got this for 20 cents though so if its on sale get it then farm the cards :D			"

												This review is based on the first few levels, but already I'm impressed by the music and the 2D portal mechanics, which utilizes your teleport gun.The story consists of Captain Yuri, a generic anime space cop chasing a generic fugitive alien warlord (named Grigori for whatever odd reason) onto the surface of the planet that they have botch crash landed on. Noticed the typo did you? Yeah there are a few in the game as well. I'm going to get to why I changed my review from a positive to a negative by the end of the game, but first we have to look at the positives:Pros:Silly fun and cool acheivementsOutstanding music, seriously it's never annoyingClever easter eggs and referencesFun ""2D Portal"" platforming, yes there are a lot of portal copycats, but this one is done wellSounds great, right? How could I not like this game after saying all these nice things about it? Well here we go:Cons:The plot is recycled barf, not that I expected much from this type of game, however this particular execution of ""You're the hero, he's the villian, go duke it out somewhere... IN SPACE"" was tired at best, which doesn't lend itself to the story like a Metroid game, or hell, even Portal's story was better. ""We're here to do research on portals, oh just kidding, I'm a sociopathic computer that has been trying to kill you this entire time!""This ultimately results in the one and only boss battle in the entire game. Did I mention this game was short? Yeah so with such a great game so far, guess what they went with for the boss battle, the one and only boss battle? How did JonTron put it again?Oh yes.Simon ♥♥♥♥ING says.Grigori goes from the left wall to the right every three times you hit him, and the only gun you have in the game you get in the second act (this game is not long enough to even have a third, mind you) and it's not a bazooka, it's a tiny little pea shooter that kills normal enemies in 4 hits, and Gregori needs half a bazillion to go down.Then Grigori decides it's time for round two in some spaceships that you've both miraculously had time to repair, and get this - during the game you were supposed to have picked up power ups you can only use in this one battle, but they are barely explained to you, and I don't think I picked up more than one. Oh what to do... Can't go back for them, so onwards you go for some more....SIMON ♥♥♥♥ING SAYS... BULLET HELL MODE.Yes, I ragequit that boss, yes, speedrunners have beaten this game in a clean 17 minutes...Maybe I'll go back and kill the dumb boss later...No, don't get it unless it's on sale, if for nothing else but the music, or just buy the soundtrack if it's available.Final verdict:3/10 - Cool (OK borrowed) concept and music with nice pixel visuals, but it all goes down the drain due to a tedious and unforgiving boss fight, and the lack of content or emotional investment/story development overall.

												Out There Somewhere is a waste of time.  Everything about it is uninteresting.  The puzzles are never challenging and the teleportation mechanic is berely explored.  Most enemies can be ignored and killing them is a chore because the gun fires too slowly.  Instead of being engaging, each obstacle only serves to inconvenience you.  The colors are so same-y, all the envoronments blend together, and so dark it's sometimes unclear where enemies and platforms are.  The music is generic and the writing is boring and entirely unneccessary.  Things were only put in the game because games usually have them, not because they add anything to the experience.  All they add are a few seconds to the game's paltry length.Everything in this game has been done better in a thousand internet flash games.  Instead of spending money on this, go online and play one for free.			"

												This game is completely broken and does not seem to run correctly, if it ever does.  What's more, it actually breaks your Steam session as it crashes in such a way that Steam thinks that the application is still running.  This keeps you from launching other titles or uninstalling the game.There are WAY better games for a couple bucks that were actually developed correctly.  I'm honestly shocked this is still being sold in such a broken, steam-detrimental state.			"

												Finished the game in just under 1h30m... It's way too short. I expected 4-5h of gameplay. Game mechanic is fun though. Way... Way too short. I'm Quite disapointed...I thought it was a space shooter + land exploration adventure game. There's only 2 small part with space shooting which are quite boring (no ship upgrades, etc...).This is more like a demo than a full game. I really have to wait for reviews on these indie games in the future. You never know what it's going to be like from the video presentation.			"

												This game is fantastic, but I can't quite say why in a regular review, so let's take this by category. GAMEPLAY  MECHANICS The main attraction of this game is the teleport gun. This gun acts as a normal projectile when fired, but it doesn't hurt enemies. Instead, it passes through them until it hits a wall. When this happens, your character is teleported to the location that the projectile hit!Later in the game, you find a regular gun, which acts just as you'd expect, hitting and destroying enemies.There are also tractor beams in the game, which, depending on their color, will either change the trajectory of your teleport bullets, destroy your teleport bullets, or act as regular walls, activating your teleport bullets.I give the mechanics an 8/10. They are very unique to this game, and are very fun to use! ITEMS There aren't many items in the game. You start off with the teleport gun, then later find the regular gun. There are collectible alien artifacts and abandoned cores that increase your max health and upgrade your ship in the final battle against Grigori, but they're far from required.I give the items a 6/10. There isn't much variety, but what's there is nice. CONTROLS The controls are similar to that of an online flash game; The arrow keys move your character, Z jumps, X shoots your teleport gun, and C shoots your regular gun once you get it. It's easy to get used to, and feels natural. The platforming is sharp and percise, unlike other games like this that use bad platforming mechanics as a difficulty aspect.I give the controls a 10/10! DIFFICULTY This game is fairly easy overall, though it has some parts that I feel are unnecessarily difficult. Some of the mechanics are hard to learn, but once you do learn them, they're easy to repeat.I give the difficulty a 7/10. The balancing could use some work.Overall, I give the gameplay an 8/10. SETTING  STORY Story is almost nonexistent in this game, but I kind of like that. The story can be summed up in just one sentence: ""You're the good guy, and the bad guy ran away, so you have to catch him."" The characters, however, are pretty bland. Only a few of them have any personality, those being the player character, the villain, and the entire species of tree... guys.I give the story a 5/10.[/b] MUSIC [/b]The music. Good God, the music. I would buy the soundtrack to this game twice if I could! (I mean, I CAN, but I won't because money is a limited thing.) The music perfectly matches the theme of the game and every song is perfect for the area it's played in. Every song is nice to listen to, and I sometimes find myself turning on the sountrack for no reason.I would give the music a 20/10, but I'm stuck with 10/10. VISUALS The makers of this game did a great job with the visuals of this game. Everything from the backgrounds to the animations to the finer details of the pixel art looks amazing and is easy to look at. This is one of the few games I can play without my eyes hurting.I give the visuals a 9/10.Overall, I give the setting an 8/10. TECHNICAL STUFF  BUGS This is an easy category for me because there are no bugs! At least, none that I've found.I give the bugs a 10/10! The developers made this game air-tight! PERFORMANCE This game runs at a consistent FPS, and never crashes. Although, I have a PC made to run games like Skyrim and Chivalry, so this probably isn't a fair category.The performance gets a 10/10 from me!There were a few other categories I used for the technical stuff section, but they were too short to include.Overall, I give the technical stuff a perfect 5/7 10/10! OTHER STUFF I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT This game is incredibly short. I am terrible at doing things quickly, and I easily beat the game in less than 20 minutes.The game includes a timer that you can activate in the settings. This displays a little timer in the corner of the screen while you're playing that keeps track of your playtime, which is great for speedrunners. There are quite a few secrets and shortcuts in this game, which I really like. Here's a little hint for you:  The obvious path isn't always the only path. This game goes on sale all the time, so if $2 is too steep for you, just give it a few days and it'll be down to $.49 before you know it. OVERALL This game is fantastic! I give it a 9/10! I highly recommend buying it!			"

												The game is ridiculously difficult, even with a gamepad.Update:It turns out all i had to do was git gud. Once i figured out how to double jump, the game was a breeze. I even did a second, much quicker run of the game where i was able to get nearly all cores and artifacts, upgrade the ship, and defeat the bad guy, in 40 minutes or less.So... the game is actually pretty decent after all: cute graphics and music, and fairly interesting puzzles and secrets.By the way, the secret to double jumping is that the character must touch the floor and jump right before the teleportation. So, just time the jump to land before the pellet hits the wall, keep your eyes on it, and jump right before it hits.			"

												I was going through my games and I saw this one, which I had completely forgotten about. This game is really cool, idea wise and graphics wise and all that jazz.My playtime isn't particularly high because you know when you buy a lot of games on sale at once, and you give each of them a whirl and one or two stick out and you just kind of grind them while forgetting about the others? And then afterwards you kind of just never feel like playing the games you skipped out on again for no real reason? Even though you know they're fun and you'd enjoy it? Yeah, that is what happened here, sadly. Don't let the story make it sound like this game is boring or something, because it is really fun. I have no idea why I can't get back into it, but I think it's just that situation, since it seems to be pretty common (at least for me).Anyway, yes I recommend this game and yes it is pretty unique and a good puzzle experience.

I've only played a while, but the mechanics seem consistent enough. Gameplay wise, I think there could be some improvements. I have an issue with using the jump and fire keys also being used to talk to NPCs. Besides that, though, this game is pretty great.One thing I have to highlight is the soundtrack. It's pretty dynamic, and really brings the atmosphere together, pairing nicely with the pixel graphics.			"

												A charming indie puzzle game here with a interesting mechanic of continued momentum while using a portal gun.  The overall difficulty of the game isn't very high though some of the later timing puzzles do get a bit of an exercise of rote memory.  I wasn't a speed runner through the game (taking just under an hour to clear the game) and I did not find any of the many many secrets in this game (finishing the game with no gun upgrades, no additional health and only 3 of the 12 cores for the final ship mission.Even still with the checkpoints being unfrustratingly placed the game is still possible to beat and I would recommend the title for anyone out there who likes games like this.  If I ""had"" to give some negatives to the game - it would be the general use of secrets hidden behind a screen (odd blind jumps) which makes it very easy to miss tons of things and the repetitive BGM.

Its brevity commands a low price point but what you get is a solid adventure-platformer with an appealing asthetic and an enjoyable soundtrack. My only real complaint is that backtracking is impossible at points meaning doing a full completion run requires starting anew and planning deliberately; but it's short enough that doing so isn't a frustrating time expenditure.

												This game is truely a gem.  I have played through it about 7 times.  The teleport gun is the basis of the game and I thought it was a cool mechanic.  My only complaint is that it was too short and I kinda wish there was a sequal.  The music was pretty good too but the ending was a bit unclear.  There are secrets scattered across the games levels to aid you in beating the game; such as health increases, a sub machine gun, and ship upgrades.  Sadly though, when a game has an acievement for completing it in under 20 minutes, you know it wont keep its exciting edge the third time around.			"

												After enjoying completing the game with 100% and just some cards left to collect, I decided to give this fine piece of software a review.So what's this game anyway? Basically it's a platformer, with minor Shoot'em Up parts both at the beginning and the end of the game. Armed with a teleport gun and a space suit you control Captain Yuri on his journey to defeat the evil Grigori.Simple control scheme: arrow keys and 3 others, Z X C by default, Europeans might want to swap Z with Y prior to starting. The game does have controller support, I used a keyboard though and had no problems.Over the course of my several playthroughs and experiments I only encountered 1 or 2 minor bugs you wouldn't experience without specifically looking for it. Even if, none of them was game breaking. Otherwise it's got smooth and clean animations, perfect hitboxes and overall fair difficulty. There's no real tutorial but is streamlined on directs you perfectly through the mechanics, the growing complexity should be no problem for the average player.If you want all achievements though, you're in for a tougher challenge, brace yourself and activate your thinker.As for the design, it's an adorable small indie treasure, you won't get 10 hours of excitement but instead you'll get challenging fun packed into a small platformer. Nothing looks out of place, everything fits into this colourfully bright (but not bilindingly bright) small universe. Even the music is brilliant for such a small game, it's repetetive but it doesn't get boring, this way it's even fun waiting for the ""delay"" Achievement while doing something else. Only downside is there's no transition when the BGM changes but hey, it's not like that would hurt anyoneMy first playthrough took me an hour and roughly 15 minutes, the only thing that really got on my nerves was clicking through Yuris messages on my playthroughs after the first one...Bottom line: whatever you pay, it's a bargain			"

												Having bought this in a pack of four games for next to nothing in the sale, I honestly feel like I'd have been happy to pay full price for this as the replay value is immense. The Story itself is actually quite short, and can be fully completed in under twenty minutes after enough practice, but what it lacks in length it makes up for in pure, unbridled fun. It plays like how you'd imagine arcade games would be nowadays, it's smooth, simple, and some of the moves you have to pull off require a serious amount of precision, not to mention patience! The teleport mechanic is nothing short of genius. It's one button that sends out one projectile that puts you wherever it hits; Poundland's answer to a portal gun. However despite the simplicity, it still has so much depth as you end up having to string together jumps and multiple shots to overcome obstacles in some very challenging ways, not many of which are immediately apparant towards the end or for a few of the secrets.That's another thing this game does well, collectibles. I went through my first playthrough taking roughly over an hour and I found a grand total of two collectibles. I didn't even know one type of collectible even existed until I saw an achievment for it! Without giving much away, there are some places that pure curiosity will take you on your second playthrough, using all your skills from the first, that will give you the best feeling of ""Woah, I didn't even know that was in the game!"" and then a feeling of ""What the F*** do I do to get that?"" and believe me you will try for anywhere between ten minutes to an entire afternoon to get that but you'll get it. And that feels so good. Behind all of this, is the brilliant and catchy soundtrack, which is stuck in my head forever at this point unfortunately!In short, well worth the price and I'm still coming back for more from a game which can be beaten comfortably in roughly half an hour. Well done Miniboss, you have me hooked!			"

												I've never left a review for a game but this an exception.  I picked this game up on a whim, and it didn't disappoint.  While the game is short, especially on subsequent playthroughs, I'd say it's about the length of the first portal game maybe a little shorter.  The gameplay is excellent except a couple spots where you don't realize where a platform is, and I thought the final boss, while fun, was just way too different from the rest of the game.  The music and art style is quite fun, with the few cutscenes having a distinct almost robotech flare to them.  This is a great and fun game, and I highly suggest checking it out, and I look forward to more from Miniboss.			"

A sort of platformer-exploration game in the first run through and a mad dash in the second, and scouring the planet for the full set of fusion-coil-thingies... well, that part is harder.Fun and to the point.

												Out There Somewhere is a great little indie game. I finished the game in a little over an hour, which would be short for any other game, but Out There Somewhere manages to make the most of the time you spend with it, introducing gameplay mechanics generously, and subtley teaching the player new ways to approach old mechanics.I bought the game when it was on sale, however I regret that, as the game is well worth the 5 dollars it would normally cost.

												This is a good example of a game that does a lot with a little. The tile art is simple, but pretty enough. Tiles don't always tile, but that's nothing worth griping about. It would've been cool to see some more artsy elements, but overall nothing detracts from play, and that's the important part.  It speaks for itself and there is never any visual confusion save for the occaisional cliff that you're certain must be surmountable.The gameplay is good. Controls do exactly what you expect them to once you get comfortable with them. The puzzles do a lot with just two tools. Because of the ease of use and the length of the game (1-2 hours if you REALLY take your time) this is one of the few titles where I'm compelled to beat it 100% with all achievements.Grab it while it's cheap and have some good, classic fun.

												I don't agree that this game is anything like Super Metroid or Cave Story. Don't expect to upgrade your teleporter or gun, gain extra abilties like double jumping or branch into different areas as I have not encountered anything like that half an hour into the game but do not be surpirsed if it does show up. If anything, I would describe it as Super Meat Boy (Lite!) with Portal, although with a different physics mechinic in place of flinging.It's not kidding when it describes its other elements, though. It really is a refliex-heavy game. Often, the player may solve the puzzle long before he or she actually completes it because of the timing and aim required for the exeuction. It's honestly pretty satisifying, as a result, to get through a room because I managed to not only figure out the crazy, over-elobrate plan where I need to let some beam idle for 4.5 seconds before activating the second beam, destorying a boulder on the far right, teleporting to a platform on the left using the first teleporter, waiting for the first beam to deactivate (as beams block each other), and then using the second beam to get to the door.  This, however, can be frustrating if a player wishes to rush through the game or something. That is all the game has going for it.The chiptune music doesn't really motivate players to take their time, being ridicalously reptitive and loud, and the setting and story isn't memorable or worth paying attention to so far in my playthrough. I do not even know the name of my pro- oh, it's Yuri. My male protagonist's name is a common tag for lesbian storylines in manga. Hooray. The artstyle is, well, more of what you see can see in the store page.It's fun but nothing more than an extended flash game to me. It doesn't have the humor of Portal and so the only really motivating to keep playing is to complete more puzzles. Get it when it goes on sale for less than 50 cents. "

												The gameplay mechanic is creative, and each completed puzzle gives a little burst of rewarding feedback.  Short game, not much longer than an hour for the first playthrough, if you take your time a bit.  Good replayability when trying to find hidden secrets in earlier areas with the skills you learn later in the game.Nice retro style, but really cool little animations thrown in for those who pay attention.  Super cute story.Music is great at first, though it plays solidly on repeat through some larger areas, and can get grating at times.  Personally, I got a second wind and started to jam out to it again after playing it long enough.Well worth the great sale price I got it for, though I still would have gotten an enjoyable $4.99 out of it had I paid original price.

												A very unique and enjoyable platformer centered around using a teleport gun, almost like a 2D Portal. The puzzles are well-crafted and clever, with more than one way through many of them. The biggest downside for me was the length of the game or, more accurately, the lack thereof. This game is very short. The 1.6 hours I have on record was a single full playthrough, beginning to end. The only replay value is in the achievements, if you're into that sort of thing. If you're like me, and couldn't care less about the achievements, you may find yourself thankful that you got the game on sale and only paid $0.19 for it. I recommend the game - not the price. $5 is a little steep for a game that's over so quickly. What's there is worth playing, but it's not worth the asking price. Even with as challenging as some of the puzzles are, requiring multiple attempts, I managed to beat the game in 90 minutes - and I'm pretty terrible at platformers.Get it on sale, and you won't be disappointed. Pay full price, and you might find yourself a little irritated at the shortness of the game.			"

												There's a lot of junk on Steam, specially in the 2-49ct category. I bought this game for 19ct and I'm overwhelmed at how good it is. It's basially an 8-bit style platformer where Portal-style puzzles are solved with the help of a teleportation gun. The graphics are neat, the dialogs funny and the music is very retro, though it could use some polishing (the transitions between the loops are not very smooth and the music start to be very repetitive quite fast). Nevertheless, Out There Somewhere is a nice, challenging little game with NES-style graphics and music. Grab it if you see it in the bargain bin: it's totally worth it, or of course at full price, if you're a retro puzzle platformer geek. You sure won't regret it!			"

Pretty short if you blitz through, with the majority of game time being in exploration for all of the different collectibles. Very charming graphics and soundtrack. Story isn't terribly strong, but the gameplay is great enough to make up for it. Difficulty felt just right - difficult but not too punishing and not discouraging.Overall, a very fun experience.

												A simple, yet great Metroidvania. Charming retro graphics, awesome cutscenes, serious puzzle platforming.

												Out There Somewhere is a laid back puzzle platformer. The main mechanic is a teleportation gun which allows you to teleport where you shoot. The gun is similar to the one in The Swapper but time doesn't slow down when you fire it and you can't make multiple copies. The difference is that this teleportation gun preserves momentum. So if you fire it at a wall and jump right before the projectile hits you'll be jumping when you teleport.This leads to some interesting gameplay the first time through and some very interesting exploring on the second playthrough. The game clocks in at about 2-3 hours for the first playthough but it's almost better the second time through when you're better with the mechanics. It has a couple shmup sections but they are brief, which is bad if you're a shmup fan but good if you suck at them like I do.Overall I really enjoyed this game. If you like puzzle platformers with interesting mechanics I'd definitely recommend this to you.			"

												I love this game! I had a lot of fun playing it. I still haven't finished it, but I will get back around to it soon. I heard that it is really short if you know where to go, but if you haven't played it, then you don't know where to go. It took me about an hour just to get the jumps down. You have to teleport and then jump to get to certain ledges, it's easy to get stuck until you get the timing down. Well worth the price!			"

												It's Short. (Only about 1.5 hrs on first run, mainly due to failing rooms over and over.)It's somewhat difficult. (But not over the top difficult.)8/10 Would miss that abandoned core to the left of the start again.			"

												Where's my level twooooo... !  WHERE IS EVERYTHING AFTER LEVEL ONE !?!?....frustratingly short. I got stuck with a puzzle at some point and that's the only reason why I didn't finish it at the first seating.I still reccomend it because it is dirty cheap and it is amazing UNTIL YOU BEAT THE ONLY BOSS IN FIVE MINUTES --and--I want the developer to have a positive vibe about this so that I will be able to buy Out There Somewhere Else: The Full Five Hour Game.

												This game is quite fun actually! I love playing relaxing, rewarding, and unique 8 bit games and this is definitely one! I would definitely recommend this game to my friends. I love the teleportation tool and the maps. The graphics are really cool and give a great feeling to the game.8/10 - Isaak Aprooved			"

												Although it is a very short game (around an hour long), it was fun while it lasted.  The uses of the teleport gun were pretty inventive and there are some hidden secrets to discover if you want to take your time.With a sale price of 19 cents, you can't ask for much more.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a nice puzzle platformer that genuinely feels like a mix of Cave Story and Portal. The game is pretty short - and it's fully possible to beat it within 20 minutes, which is one of the game's hardest challengest - but there's a bunch of things to collect that provides replay value. I got it for 17 cents when it was on sale, but it's honestly worth the money whatever the price.The music works with the setting and the graphics are done well and the gameplay is fair, but challenging. My only complaint is the shooting segments. While it's not hard to pick up on, it really clashes with the rest of the game's gameplay, and the fact that it's the final fight bizarre since your only experience with such segments is at the very beginning. But overall though, it's a great cheap game.			"

												Love it. It`s like Portal meets Metroid. You are a lone astronaut that crashed on an unknown planet where you have to survive by thinking you way through many platforming puzzles, armed only with your trusty teleport gun. The 2D perspective is key here and thanks to the clear 16 bit graphics these 2 create an excellent contrast and dimension for navigation puzzles. The soundtrack is amazing and keeps your blood flowing and your brain working. And your brain should keep working cause puzzles start easy and tend to get harder with each new screen passing. A must play for any fans of Portal or platformer puzzle games.			"

												A super fun (relatively) short game. It's fun to get all achievements. Watch out, it's not a game you can dedicate countless hours into. You can beat this game in under 10 minutes if you want to. I really recommend this game, but don't expect a lot of content. It's more quality than quantity.			"

												This game could use a longer story, or maybe even a sequel, with an expansion on the gameplay and characters etc etc. Either way, I really thoroughly enjoyed it. A breakdown of this game:- Soundtrack is really nice, fits the scene IMO- Pixel art done well- Gameplay mechanic is simple yet versatile.The only thing I think this game needs more is more talking aliens. Those guys are absolutely hilarious. Oh, and more really obscure secret areas. I like finding those.In the end, I enjoyed this, and you should too. Well worth the money.			"

												I payed 21 cents for this game and got 81 minutes of fun out of it. I am sure for more skilled puzzle people it will take you probably 45 minutes to finish. It is a good one go game if you have 1 hour to play video games. It was fun and the ending was very repeatative and easily won once you his moves. The space battles were easy however the setup for playing on the planet could ahve been done better in my opinion. The story for the game was very good. The friendly aliens threw me off but aside from that they played a good part and also made you feel like a badass hero.All in all for the price I payed and also the brain teazers for certain levels I recommend this game for anyone wanting a fun and casual game that they want to draw out or just try to speed run.

												Love it. It was a bit hard to comprehend how the game worked but after 10 or 15 minutes I was in the groove of things. Well thought out puzzles that are still fun on a second playthrough. *spoilers*Get the fantastic map here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/263980/discussions/0/522728268805977904/?insideModal=1 if you're interested in getting all the cores and remember that you have to SKIP all the checkpoints before you get the gauss gun in order to return to the beginning and get the final core.

Great game!I bought this game through the 'Developer Alliance Bundle' which was on sale for around $1, this game looked like the worst of the bundle. In the end I decided I'd give it a try and BAM - GREAT GAME - AMAZING GAME. I have played through it many times, trying to get all of the achievements.Note: The trailer is misleading because the space ship shooter minigame is only at the start and end for only like 1 minute.What is good about it: GREAT game mechanics, catchy music, funny (and slightly cheesy) characters, secrets that are fun to find, controller support and steam trading cards.What is bad about it: The controls took a while for me to get used to and the trailor.If you see this game on sale, don't hesitate to buy it.

												This is not a very long game, but definitely worth your money. You'll likely clock in at around 1-2 hours of gameplay, depending on your level of skill, and/or however long it takes for you to master the controls. Regardless of clear time, this is a game you will definitely love if you're into platformers with innovative, clever action-puzzle mechanics.			"

												I was surprised by how fun this platformer was. The physics are cool and it has good puzzles involving it. It is pretty short, but if you search for secrets and play through it, you will get ~1.5 hours out of it. It is definitely worth it if you pick it up on a sale.			"
