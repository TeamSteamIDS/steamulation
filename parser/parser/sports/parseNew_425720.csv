												Played a set with a friend in the 2 player mode by swapping the headset between us.Reminded me of real minigolf, but it's so much better.For instance:-I can stand on air, it's terrifying and feels so wrong, but I can do it-When my ball flies into the pond I'm not out $10 on hole 2 because I can't putt for crap.-I can make my ball shoot out of cannonsUnfortunately it's still close enough to reality. It still takes ten putts to get it in the hole once you're right next to it because you keep hitting it just to the side of the hole.			"

												UPDATE: The new course editor is fantastic.  Creating courses is actually fun, and showcases the strength of motion controllers as tools for creation.  It also eliminates the shortage of holes.  The workshop support has been integrated throughout the game and mkaes this an easy recommend.Played a full round of 18 holes with my friend online.  Probably one of the best experiences I've had with the vive so far.Pros:  - The physics and atmosphere are great.  - Fantastic as a social multiplayer game.  - Course editor completes the gameCons:  - The physics can be wonky at times.

												Cloudlands is a game where all you really have to ask yourself is whether or not you like minigolf. The motion controls are pretty much perfect, and this is probably the closest you can get to actual minigolf without leaving your room. The courses are another matter entirely; some of them are pretty standard, like the usual 3 or 4 par traditional courses you'd see on a real mingolf course, but some of them are enormous sprawling 40+ par courses filled with ball cannons. rotating obstacles, half-pipe curves, and more that are really fun to play with a friend. It has both online and local multiplayer, with the local play involving each player playing the course and then passing the headset to the next player. It may not be the most exciting game on the Vive, but if you've got friends who are up for some minigolf you can get a pretty good time out of this.			"

												Cloudlands: VR Minigolf is a game that I bought excited about a multiplayer game that you just pass the HMD to the next person. That is not in the game yet but will be coming with a future update. I still enjoyed the game although I don’t really have the patience for it and some of the holes are frustrating. Pros:After hitting the ball you can press the trigger button and instantly warp to your balls current location. This is perfect and necessary for a game like this. Controls felt good, after a couple test swings I felt like I knew exactly how hard I need to hit it. The haptics on the controller were spot on as well. Good course design. I personally like the simple wholes like you would find at an actual minigolf place but if you are a fan of wacky and difficult this game will cater to you as well. Graphics are well done. Cons:Frustrating at times, I played hole that had a Par of 42??? It was fun for maybe the first 5 or 6 hits then it was just annoying and I was swinging like a madman trying to finish it. It may be I don’t have the patience for it, I am sure some people will love it.   No spectator mode: If you have people that are trying to watch your game on the TV/Monitor it will only show what the person playing is looking at so it ends up being really shakey and not enjoyable to watch. I am not sure how they could fix this maybe incorporate a 3rd person spectator mode.  TLDR:The game is fun don’t get me wrong. I recommend it on a sale, but personally I only like about half of the holes. The simple ones are a lot of fun but holes that are just crazy and have par 42 were not enjoyable and made me lose my patience. There is not a whole lot of content as of writing this review but I hope with future updates and free DLC more content and courses are added. I think if the Devs made the courses more like 3D Ultra Minigolf it would be fantastic, I think it would be cool to have multiplayer where you could use powerups and such it would make it an insane party game.

												Great atmosphere and a very enjoyable experience, especially if you play with a friend who has another vive. You can play on one vive but you'll have to switch the headset a lot. If the developer is reading this, I suggest in addition to asking the number of players, have an option to play XX amount of holes before switching, i.e. switch every 3 holes and player 1 plays holes 1-3 and then player 2 plays 1-3. Or 5 or 9 or whatever. I think this would make local multiplayer less tiresome.Create your own miniput levels, so now I can prove my 12 year old self right when I had said I'd be able to make the best miniput holes.You can play other people's creations which are up/down voted by the community and make your own custom courses with them.Par 42 hole? Yup it's there. Cannons, fans, bumpers. Different club lengths appear to have different speeds so you can choose the one you like best to get the best feel.Sometimes there are physics issues where you hit it in a way you didn't expect but these don't detract much. Graphics are beautiful and simple, very relaxing.Pro-tip: Disable the music in the settings. You will thank me.Another suggestion for the developer: Maybe have a zoom function in the editor to allow you to work with bigger pieces, unless it's there and I'm blind. Sometimes it's hard to work with when they're small. We have a minimum 2x2 meter space, let's use it!!EDIT: There is a zoom function, labelled 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x on the left side, I just didn't see it. Though it would be useful to be able to drag your entire creation, but I'm not sure how to do this. I built mine accidentally into the edge of my playspace.			"

												I don't like mini-golf games that have massively long and complicated holes, because it's not as much fun nor as impressive an achievment to get a 41 on a par 42 (yes, this game has a par 42) as it is to get a 2 on a par 3, yet both count the same on your scorecard.That being said, this game is good enough to get my approval anyway.

												Needs optimisation as it had some stuttering that i haven't had on any other vr game so far. Also actually getting the club to hit the ball requires some finesse as you can easily end up ghosting right through it. Also the physics are bugged, with the ball reliably bouncing backwards away off a gentle slope. Not the best vr game out there, needs work, but at its core it's still fun. the bugs just push it toward the edge of frustration. Still did all 18 holes. You'd be better served going to play it in real life. That said, i'm sure there'll be updates and fixes.			"

												A relaxing zen like miniature golf experience.  The game uses one touch controller for the putter and is based on physics, some skill, and dumb luck of course.  It comes with 18 holes but there are alot of user made holes thatre pretty good and accessible through the game.  I like to play a random nine in the games standard course for now.  I think this game is worth it, for the good VR mini golf experience and the workshop support.			"

												Relaxing and fun. Would love to see more ""out there"" maps, like haunted houses or space themed or weird gravity to take advantage of the VRness.Solid gameplay.Con: Multiplayer is not really feasible. Holes can be short and swapping headsets every couple of minutes is a real pain, especially since people tend to have different head sizes and IPD. Would be better if it let you play all 9/18 holes and then swap to the next person.			"

												Short time playing it so far.  I find that the vive has a lot of trouble with making you stare at your feet, which is core to the idea of playing golf.Courses seemed fun, although many are much much longer than necessary.Physics feel pretty good, but they need to loosen up the hole a bit as it is particularly frustrating compared to the rest of the course which is moderately forgiving.The game is fun, but not well tuned to the headset and the price feels high relative to the experience.  I'd suggest the demo.			"

The Achievements are quite unrealstic and need to be managed alittle bit better. Your power won't translate properly without a small backswing, and some of the courses can be the stuff that aggrovates people to no end and casue stress and frustration.The Game design itself is very pretty and you can loose yourself into the enviroment.I recommend this game to you if you like golf, don't mind abit of a challange or are looking for a good VR party game.

												So far this game has given me the best bang for my buck. There are a lot of great VR games out there but Cloulands has the highest replay value thus far.The controls feel spot on, although, staring down at your feet can start to give you a bit of a neck cramp if you play this game in long sesssions. The game has an online mode but at the time of writing this it is a ghost town, so don't expect too much competition. I'm looking very forward to the course editor which should add even more replay value to this game. Bottom line is, if you're going to spend $20 on a VR game this is the way to go, a lot of games for the same price out there feel more like a proof of concept and not a complete game.Warning to any achievement completionists out there, this game has a few bugged achievements that I cannot get to unlock no matter how many times I complete the criteria.

												+ Courses look great, fun to walk through+ Controls are solid, easy to pickup and play+ Putting is acurate, ball seems a bit slow tho+ Enviornmental sounds are great (when music is off)- Music quickly becomes maddenning (you can turn it off)- Textures disapear for no reason- Grass / Leave textures look really fake in VR- Courses are unfair if your trying to get a competitive score- Course design neglates player hovering in air / standing in objectsOverall I think this is a solid putt-putt game, but it's not nearly as engaging as some of the other titles. It probably won't get nearly as much play time on my list. Maybe with more content it will get better.Edit: My intial impression was low because 1) the music put me in a bad mood and 2) I had placed a controller on my desk without turning it off, which meant the grid was up all the time and caused some textures to disappear. This is really the best putt-putt game I've played. As a golfer, this is very realistic, to the extent that I curl up my toes as the ball inches toward the hole. I only wish I could disable the texture disappear ""feature"" that is so distracting.			"

The courses vary from fairly simple to incredibly challenging. Can be a scary when you're on the higher points on some courses, but it's all fine. Some of the graphical choices are a little off for me (The blue floor courses don't look great to me) but many of them look very nice indeed. Worth a punt.			"

												Cloudlands: VR Minigolf is aiming to be the Virtual Reality minigolf experience. Boasting a solid put mechanic, intuitive room-scale and click-to-teleport locomotion, this game is definitely up to par. I have not tried any user generated content yet, the official course has kept me more than happy. The gameplay feels very realistic, though getting your stroke down can be a bit trying as you don't have the weight of an actual club. This game delivers on the familiarity of minigolf while adding elements only available in a digital format- such as moving blocks, cannons, fans, and other obstacles that would be either impossible or impractical in the real world.Pros:+Great headtracking, room-scale, and click-to-teleport locomotion.+Official course is very well designed and a pleasure to play.+Feels like the real thing.+Pleasing visuals.+Putting is consistent once you get a feel for the motion range.Cons:-Local multiplayer is workable, but a hassle. Not really recommended as a party game since you're going to be constantly having to adjust the straps. God forbid someone is wearing glasses and you have to adjust the lenses too.-My localisation appears to be broken. I get random chinese characters on some menu elements and buttons. This is not a gamebreaking issue though since the menus are intuitive enough to guess and get by.-Would be nice if they could introduce a control mechanic to ghost/materialize your club. Theres been times where I've accidentally hit the ball while I'm just trying to look around.-Casual players can become frustrated at the difficulty of some holes, bringing down the mood of the group. Nobody likes failing infront of their friends. Know the people you're trying to play with.-Lack of weight in the controller makes getting a feel for putting more difficult than in real life.			"

That being said, VR mini golf just seems like one of the perfect uses of VR, so I downloaded the demo first to check it out. I was not wrong! Chaos ensued quickly, smacking the wall, knocking into stuff just outside the play space. Probably some of the most VR fun I've had yet, and most since I knocked a table over while using my Samsung Gear VR. The sort of nonsense that you can really only laugh about instead of getting frustrated!Pick a ball, pick a putter, and hit the ball! The physics are fun, the courses are fun! In this VR setting you can play on courses that in real life wouldn't work out!The cost of this is easily the cost of a game at an 18 hole mini golf course. And you don't have to put up with the summer heat! This is hands down one of my favorite purchases for my HTC Vive and I'm looking forward to seeing more from it!			"

												Heckuva lot of fun. It's a great game that I bust out when entertaining friends on VR. Most people get it within five seconds of putting on the headset. I've had children from ages seven to ten just get entertained regardless of how well they do. They don't seem to get frustrated, and they love watching adults try to get past the really difficult courses.You can play it one handed, and aside from having to take off and put on the headset multiple times, there aren't really any gripes that I have. Then again, with people having head sizes not too far off from one another, this is an easy recommendation for those that like to show off the Vive and laugh with friends.			"

												This game has some bugs to work out. The scenery can't be beat, but the multiplayer is EXTREMELY frustruating with one headset. Also the really tough levels with Par 40 can be fun the first time but are not okay for multiplayer. The music is awful, just the same three notes repeated incessantly. Fortunately you can turn this off. I would suggest making the multiplayer do one player at a time for the whole course and the multiplayer course only par 5 and below. A lot of potenital but not there yet.			"

												This is one of the games I was most excited to play when I first purchased my Vive. Unfortunately, after purchasing 20 other games, this is one of the games I rarely play. The course and putter look great in the hand but the game play is difficult and repetitive. On a real mini putt, I can generally get par. On this course, I am usually 10 over par or more on each hole. Hopefully they will prepare additional courses (or a sequel) that will be a little bit more polished and play more realistically. Overall, quite disappointed in this game.			"

												I have played about 5 VR games so far, and this is probably my favorite.  However, it does have some bad bugs in it though that need to be fixed:- When you swing to try to hit the ball hard, the putter sometimes swings right through the ball.  Even worse, sometimes it records a stroke even though the ball didn't move.- Often you hit the ball out and instead of dropping the ball where you last hit it, it puts it at the location prior to that.- In my last game, the ball became lodged in a barrier.  I lost 5 or 6 strokes on the last hole just to get it unstuck.  What a great score I would have had. :(Also, I wish there were more courses, but please no more like hole 11.  I hate that one with a passion.			"

												Very solid game. Putting feels natural, the courses - at least the default set of 18 that I played - were a lot of fun. Has a level editor and workshop to get more holes.There are a few things that can be nitpicked, which the devs could probably easily fix. - Teleporting to your ball means teleporting directly on top of it, so you have to either move out of the way or manual teleport out of the way. - The lobby music is relatively awful after only a minute, and there's no way to turn it down, only off. - Multiplayer doesn't have you taking turns, both/all of you effectively hit your ball whenever you want. An option to take turns, at least at the beginning, would be ideal.Aside from that - well worth the price tag.			"

(You CAN download more player-created ones.)Lack of loft and ball spin.A limited set of course assets.

												Note: I haven't tried the other Mini Golf game available on Steam for VR devices so I can only attest to my experience with this one. I played this with three of my friends this past weekend and had a good time with it. The local multi-player works by trading the headset off with the other players after you have completed your hole, so it doesn't require you to trade off the headset after every shot which is good because it would likely lead to a lot of fatigue and annoyance trying to put the headset on and off. Only downside to this is that you can't hit your friends golf balls when they're in your way (since the hole is finished for them) on the course which I'm sure would lead to some funny situations. The online multilayer is not available yet so I will update my review later when that is released. You can set up the course for a full 18 or a random 9. I'd recommend going for the random 9 if you have 4 people playing because it takes a long time to get through 18. We stopped after we got past the 9th hole because it was getting late (it took an hour and a half.)I haven't had the chance to check out the course editor. My biggest gripe with the game is that you can accidentally hit your ball if the club hits it as you're switching the controller over to the next player. Only advance to the next person's turn when they are fully ready. Devs: perhaps add the option to make the club semi transparent and unable to hit the ball unless you're gripping one of the grip buttons on the side of the Vive controller. It would increase the presence because you have to 'grip' the controller in real life as one would do with an actual putter. That being said, even without the online multilayer being available and without trying the course editor, I think this is worth the price especially considering a round of mini golf in your local area would likely cost a lot more just for one round if you and 3 of your friends all wanted to play (not to mention all the possible parking fees, crying babies, allergies, loud noises, falling into stagnant ponds, and alligators that you'll have to deal with.)

												This is a fantastic VR game!  The ability to move your head and look around the course is extremely immersive.  After you hit the ball you can take a few steps to the side and watch the ball navigate the course... that is so cool.This game is like playing Mini-golf in The Witness environment, I really like the visual style.  Hitting the ball and swinging the club is extremely polished and feels great.  I love how they implemented the club in your hands.  The levels are great, I want more but I also want to replay the Full 18 dozens of times to perfect my score.  There were plenty of places where it felt like you were just taking random skillless swings but that is just like real minigolf.  And your neck will get sore staring down at the ball which is just like real minigolf!  You will even get frustrated with your shots and continually bat the ball forward just like real minigolf!There are some bugs, primarily I don't know why it shows the floor grid even after I select ""Don't show the grid"" from the options menu.  Also when you center the player on the ball it seems like sometimes it doesn't place you centered on the ball.  I haven't figured out what is happening there.  The music is also extremely repetitive.  Is the music sample only 1.5 seconds long placed on loop (""dut dun dun dunnn DUN"" is repeating in my head over and over and over)?  Maybe add an option where you can't swing unless you are standing above the actual course (versus floating off-course), this would add to the challenge associated with landing a shot near the walls.  You could implement it the way The Gallery does when you walk out of the game area.With these minor issues the game is still fantastic.  This is one of the small handful of VR games that I will come back to every day.  I highly recommend!			"

												4/5 This game on its own is has solid mini golf mechanics. I quickly played through the 18 holes that come pre-loaded in the game. After that I realized that this game is the Mario Maker of mini golf. This game will remain fun as long as there are content creators making new holes for you to easily subscribe too. I bought the game on sale for $10 bucks, because of that I scale my review against the weight of $10 dollars as opposed to $15, which for some $5 may not matter, for others it may. I feel I got my worth at the $10 dollar price point even if I don't play this game again. I will however continue to explore the community made maps and eventually dabble in creating a few of my own. In conclusion, congrats to the Devs for making something that somewhat suprised me and I hope it sees continued support in the future.			"

												Cloudlands minigolf is probably the VR minigolf game you want of all the versions out there. That does not mean the game doesn't have its shortcomings, oh no. The music is annoyingly repetitive, trying to hit the ball too hard seems to make your club pass through it, and while the magic of VR minigolf is that you can create the weirdest holes possible, some holes seemed to overdo it and felt hardly special instead.Still, with good physics, great graphics, online multiplayer AND (future) Steam workshop integration for course creation, you will never run out of new and beautiful tracks to play on.

Cons:there are very few negatives I can think of. The first version of the Vive is not very comfortable when looking downwards, but that was not a problem for me in this game as the environment is beautiful and one can play at his pace and enjoy looking around from time to time and rest inside the game.

												Cloudlands: VR Minigolf is a must-have for Vive owners. The game is simple and intuitive, with fun visuals, and a calming atmosphere. It's a great foil for games like SPT or Brookehaven Experiment. If you want to play the Vive, but it's late, or you don't feel like amping up your blood pressure, this is a much more calming VR experience.Where the game really shines is local multiplayer. It's great having friends over and being able to all experience VR. It's a dynamic that allows everyone to experience the game, and watching others play on-screen is also fun.  Pro tip: When we play, we don't use headphones, and we only exchange a single controller (the club). It makes transitioning from player to player much easier. Finally, the real value is the level editor. It's not only easy to build levels, it's clear (from the workshop holes that are up already) that there is going to be plenty of content to keep you coming back for more.  "

												Cloudlands VR Minigolf is a minigolf game in a very beautiful and astonishing ambience. The physics feel on point, never saw any bugs or weird moments. There are now just 18 holes, but the new update will bring 18 more and even better: an ingame-course-editor (hopefully with sharing via Workshop or what-so-ever - idk, sry). Sadly there are basically no ppl playing online but this is basically still because of the accessibility of VR. I got into one lobby once and it was awesome seing others from other parts of the world putting the ball around and swear like a small kid if they miss the whole by centimeters.Cloudlands VR Minigolf is an insane game. It looks so peaceful and friendly, but it can really be a d***. Not because of bugs or what-so-ever... just because the maps have a troll-factor in it, as you can see in my video:

												This is one of my favorite VR titles. Voice chat works well, gameplay feels really good, and multiplayer is a really great experience.This is a great game to show people VR. That said there are two cons (That I expect will be solved in the future):Kind of small multiplayer lobbies (4 people max, but I'd love to see 6 or 8 instead)andLimited number of holes (Though with the amount of clever mechanics and ""tricks"" used so far I have no doubts this number wont go up)Also as soon as this game gets custom user made holes it'll be an even easier sell.

												This game immerses you in a beautiful and peaceful place. There are pink trees, birds chirping and the calming effect of water flowing. In the beginning, it's a fun, relaxing and a simple game... but then it gets really, really, insanely hard. You'll start yelling at the ball, cursing it's near misses to fall into the hole, and flabbergasted at how ridiculous those last holes are. Still, it's a relief when you sink into the 18th hole.This game desperately needs a ""normal"" 18 course game for novices like myself. It would also work out great if there weren't so many steps involved in playing the same hole repeatedly for practice, or maybe an ability to reset the hole after missing par (or a hole in one) and play again.The game shows that a course editor is coming soon. I can't wait to try it out and see what other people come up with.Although I don't like the games last holes, I would still recommend this game as I enjoy coming back to play through repeatedly.			"

												Great game but not worth, the 19.99. I played the demo and loved it, but the only reason I bought this game is because it clearly states that it includes a level editor, but it doesn't. Steam should remove that tag until the level editor is actually implemented into the game. Its not worth it with just the 18 holes, but if a really good level editor is added, I could see myself buying this game again, because I refunded it.			"

												It's a nice Minigolf experience for the Vive for sure. There is one major part that breaks down and it's simply not acceptable.There is a mechanic that makes sure the club head always stays on the ground and shortens the shaft to make sure it happens. This falls apart completely when you swing hard though. This happens due to shortening happening 1 frame after which results in it not staying ontop of ground and going through it when swinging fast.How this could not be noticed by devs I don't know. But until this is fixed I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone.			"

I can see this game getting kinda old fast, though, unless they release the new hole editor or new holes themselves. Right now there's only 18 holes and once you've played them a few times I can see the charm wearing off. I'm not there yet, but I understand the other reviews who say this.All in all a solid game with good graphics, a decent interface, and pretty good physics. Well worth the purchase, especially if they add some more content.			"

												I do not recommend this game for several reasons.  First off, some of the courses are so ridiculously hard that there is no fun in there at all.  Secondly, sometimes when you teleport to your ball, if you are holding your arm in the wrong spot, your club will hit your ball and you'll lose a stroke for no other reason than you teleported.  Thirdly, the programming is off sometimes -- I literally swung through my ball several times.  I could see the putter passing right through the ball, yet it wouldn't hit it.  Fourthly, when I want to hold onto my controller tightly since I want to swing hard, I inevitably hit the grip buttons, and this brings up the score card and invalidates my swing.  There is no way to disable the scorecard opening when clicking the grib buttons that I can see, so this is terribly annoying.  Lastly, there is no way that I can see that you can change the orientation, so I'm sometimes forced to stand facing a direction where my controller sometimes loses tracking.  There should be a simple way to change the orientation so I can stand facing a different direction.  Unfortunately the makers of the game decided not to give the player that opportunity.  For all of these reasons, I cannot recommend this game.  There is a lot of promise to VR mini-golf, but the developers have a lot of work to do it make it an enjoyable experience.			"

												Nope. Close, but no cigar. Here are a few of the things I have problems with:I think the developers need to work on better helping with the timing issues, looking down to line up your shot and trying to look up to see when the windmill or whatever is in the right position does not work well with a Vive on your face.Some of the level design is nice, some of it is terrible. If you have par 42, it's not going to be fun unless you are a real masochist, leave it out. If you have to reverse your orientation 15 times on a hole, then maybe peoplle with a huge cable attached to there heads will have some issues. Needs work.			"

												This game may lure you in with all of its wacky little contraptions, but you will soon find out that it only makes the game more frustrating. I remember reaching a cores which literally had you shooting your ball out of 4 rotating cannons over and over again preying that one will sink it into the hole. The hole's par was 38 strokes which is against regulation and completely ridiculous to begin with, but my friends and I maxed out the stroke counter (which doesn't end your misory by forcing you to forfeit the game) after hitting the ball around like idiots more than 100 times!Long story short, the lack of realism and rationalism breaks emersion, which is crutial to a good VR game. For those of you looking for a wacky, deregulated mini-golf game to enjoy with your friends, you can save $14 and space in your living room by purchasing ""Golf With Friends."" "

Posted: June 26, 2016
												I originally bought this game back in April, before I got my Vive. I refunded it after minutes of playing it. The Vive wasn't designed to spend so long staring at the ground. On top of that, graphics were flickering, and at one point, the world started twisting and swaying, forcing me to pull the headset off, and gave me a headache for 2 hours.In the Summer sale, I thought I'd try it again. After all, months later, the game may have improved.Well... no. Not really. The graphical glitches are still there, with textures visible loading in, but that's not the problem.The game, for me at least, is too faulty by design. For example, after teleporting to the ball, rather than repositioning the player in a logical position, the game simply does so based on a fixed geographical angle. By this I mean if you're facing North when you hit the ball, and the direction between the resulting shot lines the ball and the hole in a south direction... when you teleport, you'll remain facing North, rather than the game predicting where you should be standing. This means that you then have to walk around the room in a tiny circle, making sure that you, physically, are now facing the correct direction.This results in the Vive, with its tethered cables, constantly twisting up. On top of this, the number of times I accidentally touched the ball with my bat while I'm turning around, and adding to my 'score'. This could easily be prevented by having the player pull the trigger or push the touch pad to retract the club, or even require it to be held when taking a shot. Of course, this wouldn't really be an issue if they just fixed the orientation.With this in mind, swapping the headset during a multiplayer game, each turn, doubled, tripled or even quadrupled the tangling issue. After our 2 minute game, my wife and I had to spend a few minutes unravelling the headset.The fixes for these 2 issues are easy and should be obvious. A path finding system would enable the game to predict where the player would want to stand, and effectively rotate the level for them, rather than them needing to rotate so much.Order of play should be based on last on, first on. This means to say whomever has the headset on at the end of the hole gets to play the first hole on the next game. This reduces (potentially halves) the number of times the headset needs to be taken off. At the moment, the game lets whomever is winning stay on. This means that a close game makes it hard to predict who is next to play.I'll not risk my headset cabled getting damaged simply because the developers can't figure out such simple solutions.At one point, we started the game, and immediately accidently touched the ball. Even though it hadn't even left the wooden start space, it counted that as a hit. We then quit the game, and tried to start again. From here, we couldnt figure out how the change the player names. As we'd done it once before, the game didn't ask us a second time. Very frustrating. I'd like to be able to choose who goes first.Another bug bear is that the menu itself is a golf game. ""Want to play? Knock the ball into this gate!"" Why slow down a menu? Just allow us to point and select. I don't want to play a game so that I can play the game!Finally, the hit detection is odd. At one point, I swang the club quite fast, and it went through the ball. It moved less than an inch, but still classed it as a stroke. Add that to the fact that there didn't appear to be any music playing, and the game was more hassle than fun.			"

												Disclaimer: I puchased this from the Viveport Store. Unfortunately that edition didn't have level editor support (Devs are working on this) so they provided me with a steam key so I could get the full experience. I recieved my steam key for free but only due to their generosity.I played the demo before buying this and I'm glad I did. What looks and feels like a novelty game on the outstide is actually a really well crafted and fun experience on the inside. The tracking works (mostly), the shot power processes well and each level is for the most part individually great.The addition of a level editor is the icing on the cake. Some of the community levels are fantastic and it's really fun seeing what other people have come up with.I've not yet tried the online mode and may update my review when I have.

												I absolutely love the concept of this game. I would recommend this to anyone with VR capabilities. The biggest gripe that I have thus far is the inability to move the environment around me. The teleport and movment features all land you facing the exact same direction (true north 100% of the time) if there were a way to rotate the camera view so I didn't have to keep turning and turning and turning and inevitably become tangled in my cord it would be top marks. Still recommend the game. Great job.			"

												I played first by myself, it was ok. Then I invited a frien over, and it was actually a lot of fun, I have to try the multiplayer! I just hope they will improve the control (it would be good to only touch the ball if we press a button, to avoid mistakes), the placement around the ball can be tricky when you don't have much space (in your room) too. Also it might be tiring for your neck to look down for too long.			"

												I must admit i'm a little torn. I one hand the mechanics of the game are very good, You really do need real life skill to be good at this. So this is definatly a positive aspect to the game. however if your cpu isnt well above the recommened then I would expect some judder with this game. Also I would like if they did more holes based on skill rather than luck , with all the high powered fans, cannons and spike traps it just takes away from the experience. When playing mini golf in real life you dont need any of these this and it still remains fun, Why do the developers feel its so important to change the game so much.But on the whole I would recommend this title due to the fact its multiplayer ( pass the headset at the end of the hole ) so everyone can get involved.

Short Review:If you love Minigolf, you'll love this game. If you hate Minigolf, you'll hate this game. Nuff said...Long Review:Cloidlands: VR Minigolf is as close to playing real Minigolf as you're gonna get (hence the short review).Pros:It's Minigolf in VR.The distance the ball goes relative to the power in your swing feels accurate.Great graphics. The pics on the steam store page accurate.Better than real life Minigolf in the sense that if a ball is close to a wall, you can wack the ball through the wall instead of having to nudge it away.There's local and online multiplayer, a rare feature in VR games. For local multiplayer, you give the headset to someone else when it's their turn, and online multiplayer just works.Nice variety in the holes.Cons:There's only one course of 18 holes (as of the time I'm writing this). Because of this it doesn't take long to go through the entire game and there's very little replayability.No voice chat in online multiplayer. The Vive has a mic, so there's no reason it shouldn't be in there.This isn't the Devs' fault, but it's a bit odd using the Vive controler as a golf club, at least for me. Don't get me wrong, it works. It's just doesn't feel like a golf club, probably because it isn't.In Conclusion:If you love Minigolf, go ahead and buy it. If you hate Minigolf, don't buy it. If you're in the middle, I'd get it on sale. I don't think it's worth the $20 in it's current state (as of the time I'm writing this). If they add more than one course I can see people paying full price for it, but untill then I'd wait till it's on sale for $10 or so. "

												This game would be great if it worked. It doesn't work. The club passes right through the ball, or the ball bounces off your club when you haven't made a swing. This happened to me many times due to tracking problems, but often the game teleports you with your club already touching the ball unless you remember to always hold it in the air before teleporting. It's doubly annoying when the club passes through the ball because many shots must be timed perfectly and hit hard to clear a ramp or moving obstacle. So you wait... and wait... and then swing, and the club passes straight through. Over and over. Also, the sound design. I'm not kidding, I think this is genuinely the worst music I've ever heard in any video game. I mean that. And it's not just the music. The sound design all around is painfully bad. It's literally painful, as in it hurts your ears to play this game, and the volume cannot be adjusted. The music can be disabled but there are no sliders to adjust ambient sounds like constant loud chirping noises, interface sounds like sudden loud door slam when someone leaves a multiplayer session or KNOCK! KNOCK! when someone joins, and so on. It all just sounds bad, and the volume is not balanced. All of this coupled with the actual golfing failing to work more often than not, and what you get is not a relaxing experience. It's horrible. Now, it seems that development is still taking place on this game. If by some miracle they do change the music, in fact redo all of the sounds, fix the bugs, and add some courses that are maybe more like actual mini-golf, then yes there's the potential for a great game here. In fact this is my second time purchasing the game. I first bought it the day I got my Vive, and not long after I got a refund. Incidentally this is the only game I've ever refunded. It was just too broken. But then I heard there had been some patches and I really want to play VR mini golf, so I bought it and tried it again. Mistake. I won't refund it agian: fool me twice shame on me and all that. But, for now at least, I definitely recommend you do NOT buy this game. TLDR: The sounds are horrible and you can't hit the ball half the time! Ugh!			"

												Pretty good ball physics, which is most important, but this needs more maps. And the maps need to be CRAZY. This is vr minigolf, not actual minigolf, go crazy with the maps. Also the visuals need improvements, I mean the main wall texture is crap. Why? Why not better image effects? Unity has tons of assets to improve your game. tl;dr; enjoyable, but needs more crazy maps.			"

												This is a really really good VR version of Mini Golf.  I watched the videos and read the reviews, then decided to try it and it's a great game!  It was way above my expectations.  I've got a 980 TI, a subpar i5 and I've got my Lighthouses way too far apart (close to 20 feet) and I had no stuttering or anything.  The gameplay is actually really fun and a lot of thought and time was obviously put into the courses and the environment.  This isn't a slapped together game, it's pretty polished.  In my opinion, the complaints about the club are more in the nit picking range.  It should probably have an option to ghost the club so you don't accidentally hit the ball, and sometimes the hit registration is a little off if you move the club around too much near the ball (which are easy to avoid once you figure out what causes it), but whether these get fixed or not (Update - It's totally user error, I just played three rounds and never accidentally hit it once, I think it's just that when you start playing, you don't control the club properly), the game is still a great game.  Definitely worth the $20.Updating my review.  Just played multiplayer and it's awesome!  So far this is my favorite Vive game.  If you've ever played mini golf and enjoyed it even a little bit, you'll love this even more because you don't have working cannons in regualr mini golf.  If you're a serious golfer, then you probably won't like this because it's mini golf and I'd guess serious golfers wouldn't like mini golf out of principle.Another thing too, the game actually looks a lot better in VR than it does in the videos.

Product received for free
												Disclaimer: I puchased this from the Viveport Store. Unfortunately that edition didn't have level editor support (Devs are working on this) so they provided me with a steam key so I could get the full experience. I recieved my steam key for free but only due to their generosity.I played the demo before buying this and I'm glad I did. What looks and feels like a novelty game on the outstide is actually a really well crafted and fun experience on the inside. The tracking works (mostly), the shot power processes well and each level is for the most part individually great.The addition of a level editor is the icing on the cake. Some of the community levels are fantastic and it's really fun seeing what other people have come up with.I've not yet tried the online mode and may update my review when I have. For the moment the singleplayer has me hooked. "

												Okay so I put off writing a review for this because I wanted to make sure I knew how to use it properly.  Best mini golf game ever.  I've played a bunch and my wife has too.  We love being able to play turn based VR mini golf.  Add to it that there is a course editor and WOW,  just WOW.  For awhile I didn't know there was an advanced controls that allows you to orient your living room in relation to the golf course.  This was very beneficial for me as I use the Rift with two sensors right now.  I don't have complete room scale yet.  This keeps my forward vector in the nice area between my two sensors.  So I don't have to step over a wire and hope the touch controllers stay in view.  Thanks a bunch to the devs,  been looking for a VR title like this.			"

												Its a really fun game with excellent holes on the main course and lots of good holes made by the community with the editor.Great fun to play online with friends. Feels realistic to playing crazy golf in real life most of the time - but sometimes my putts don't have the power that I think they should have, and sometimes they go off to the right slightly when I think they should go straight. One problem I would like you to fix is when you teleport to your ball with the trigger button, can you make it jump you to the left-hand side of the ball (as most players are right-handed).  At the minute sometimes it will jusmp you to the left of the ball, and sometimes to the right.			"

												game is amazing. i hope they are still working on it can see plenty of bugs. would like to see the options for the build it yourself expand. also if you place a piece down you can only rotate it one direction. if you unlock the snap points you can place your piece at any angle but have to eyeball it while lining it up. its doable but could be easier. only other complaint besides lack of multiplayers would be it doesn't orient you towards your monitor based off if you hit left or right handed. it seems to be based off the direction it was designed by user. thats annoying but if you kep track of your headset and mic cords you're going to be fine. game is awesome and the community builds are fun. great thinking on random buttons.

												2/6 update: So, the devs did fix the two-controller/one-controller issue I complained about in #2. #1 remains an issue, but I think it's down to Vive tracking precision. For example, on the first hole in the game when you play the 18 pre-built map holes, if I try to hit a hole in 1, it will often shoot off at an angle, but it's the same angle every time (either, say, 8 degrees above or below the hole. Always the exact same angle if it isn't dead on.) If I just randomly swing with one arm, not even bothering to aim, I hit a hole in one quite frequently. This could be jitter in my lighthouses, my own body, or God knows what else, but it's there and it *can* be irritating.If you really love minigolf, this will be a fun place to pop in, play a game or two, and pop out. The harder courses (like the par 74 hole, or the par 16 one) can get SUPER frustrating really quickly though, so my complaint that it can be a frustration simulator is still valid. Pick your maps carefully.Most of all, remember to keep your club head in the air when transitioning levels! That problem still remains. :/---End update---People are not kidding when they say this game is hard. I picked 'random 9', and my second course was, I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not, par 74. I ended up needing 88 strokes to finish it. When other people say the game is brutal they are NOT joking. This isn't inherently bad, so consider this a PSA.The actual bad:1. The clubface isn't straight. Or perhaps it's due to how the Vive controller is designed that you end up not hitting the ball straight. Either way, your shots will consistently go to the right of center unless you force yourself to compensate. There is no way to adjust the clubface angle to fix this.2. You need both controllers, but only control the putter with one. Anyone used to using a real putter will find it very strange to be accurate while holding the putter in just one hand. Or having a controller dangle while trying to put two hands on the single vive to simulate a normal putt. In truth, there's no reason they can't put everything on one controller. It would also be ok to add a two-handed putting mode, but I realize almost all users won't want that, so I also support that *not* being added.3. You have to hold your putting hand in the air when you start a new hole or else you might accidently send the ball flying when your putter spawns in on the new level -- right on top of the ball. The number of times I unintentionally hit the ball was SUPER iiritating, because I never accidentally hit the ball IRL like that. Just have the club wait for us to move into it on a new level spawn.The game does have good points though. The levels are complex and interesting -- things that could only exist in a video game. The levels themselves are visually interesting and of above average graphical quality (for July 2016 in VR). There is working multiplayer. There is a lot of potential for creative and challenging community maps. Overall, I feel kinda bad giving this a negative review, but the things I whine about really do need to get fixed before I consider this game as solid as something like The Lab or Pool Nation VR.
