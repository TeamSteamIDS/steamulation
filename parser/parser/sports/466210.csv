Early Access Review
								If you are in the mood for a racing game, with no options besides car color, with handling that is circa N64/PSX, this game is for you!If you are in the mood to support a ""Developer"" that obviously has no passion for the Industry, and is just trying to make a buck, this game is for you.Don't worry. I took the bullet for you. Refunded after 12 minutes.Go buy a hammer, and break all your fingers. Money better spent that way ;)

												This game is a fantastic value for the price I bought it for (49 cents). I mean what else can you buy for 49 cents nowadays? 1 french fry? If given the option, take the fry but since that isn't available buy this game instead. Hours of action packed racing, demolition derby, and much more fun come with this game.My favorite part however was possibly not intended, or could just be considered an easter egg. While on the well designed suburban map (one of 3 glorious tracks that come with the game), I found that there is a hill you can drive up if using a Friereri. Once up this hill the game turns into a superman simulator, as you can drive through any scenery outside of the fences conveniently placed to keep you on the road and on track to finish ahead of your competitors. You can drive through rocks, plants, trees, and even fly by driving to the edge of the map, where you endlessly plummet into blackness like in that nightmere you keep having. Speaking of comepetitors, the AI in this game is fantastic. They always crash in the same places, great consistency!Also the added posters that look like google images posted onto high resolution textured walls in the garage of women in bikinis is a great plus. Tons of masturbation material when fatigued from racing!I give this game a 9/10, would buy again.			"

												I had fun. It's ultra low-budget, rough around the edges and it lacks some features that would make it a much nicer experience like controller support and different camera angles, but I enjoyed it all the same. It has a lot of spirit!I enjoyed the demo derby levels even though it took too long for the AI to all get wiped out. More variation in the environments would be nice. I hope the developer adds more tracks and events. I think the demo derby could be an entire game on its own.PROSUltra low budget fun at a cheap price (don't expect AAA racing here)Car physics are quite funDemo derby is always good!CONSNeeds more content (can finish career in 40 mins to an hour)Could do with more polishing, as it's rough around the edgesLag spikes after playing for a while (think this may be a Unity garbage collection issue)Only one camera view (I would like one closer to the car)			"

												Okay, I bought this game and after only a couple of minutes I deem it a waste of hard drive space, even if it´s just a 2GB download. I was expecting something like the flash based games I enjoyed in my youth like need for madness and the like. Turns out those 10 year old browser games are still superior in terms of gameplay, and, suprisingly, even graphics.			"
