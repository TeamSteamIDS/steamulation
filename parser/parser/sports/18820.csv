												Think the alternate version of Mario Kart for PC. This is a fast paced, balanced game which has alot of different game modes (stunts, traditional racing, sports, arcade). You can fully customize your kart and player sometimes resulting in hilarious and ridiculous creations. It is definetly meant to be played with friends as it is way better (AI can be as smart as a banana) and there are no active servers. Hours of pure and legit fun.			"

												I first played this game back in 2010 free weekend offer.... I enjoyed it a lot, I saw this on steam Summer Sale for 99c bought and soon realized that this game has been abandoned. It's very difficult to find a server but for 99c it’s worth it. What I'd recommend is pick this game up on sale with your mates you'll enjoy it DO NOT pay full price for this as i mentioned it is abandoned by the community and the developer. I discovered there were only 15 maps. Considering all the mini games (which do get somewhat repetitive) are included in this list of 15, that leaves less than 10 maps to actually race on, but you can't go wrong with 99cent for this....

												A fun low-budget multi-player arcade racing game similar to Mario Kart.Surprisingly, it features many game modes, which not always involve racing per se. The controls are arcade-ish and the power-ups are always fun to use against your peers: ""EAT DA LOVE BOTS FOOLS!! MWAHAHA<3"" (there's an achievement for this). Customizing your vehicle and avatar is enjoyable as well - just take a look at what people posted on the steam hub!Unfortunately, they never added new content and the game is no longer supported by the developers. Although the game is moddable, it never really got any attention from the modscene.Buy the 4-pack (during winter/summer sale, it usually goes for US$4) to play with your friends since most public servers are deserted nowadays.

												The physics are terrible and the multiplayer is dead but this is a fun game to mess around in if you have friends to play with. For a low budget game it has a bit of variety. Its offers racer customization, a stunt mode, and goal mode which is similiar but is done better in rocket league.			"

												The Extreme Paintbrawl of kart-racers. You're stuck with the AI since the community (rightfully) died and said AI can be gamed to always lose if you just hit escape and go into the menu. They begin running directly forward and never changing direction.Custom servers also a crapshoot - it refused to let me play another mode/level than ""Punchbowl"" and ""tag"" no matter what I set it to.I didn't really think people needed to be warned away but damnit, if I'm gonna play this for a bit, I'm gonna write about it too.

												Zero Gear is a cart combat multiplayer online party game. Its more than eight player racing, the maps have a variety of objectives such as three-on-three European and American football. There are battle modes such as using boxing gloves to knock other cars over the edge of a sumo ring into the abyss below. Other maps are skeeball and even a pachinko machine with your cars. Its a true party game for anyone that has seven other friends online with this budget game. The game does offer a four pack for the price of two, which is always incentive. If you have no friends, the real problem is that five years after its release, there is no one playing.The game plays easy with an accelerator, a nitro boost, a mini jump for sharper turns. You can gain nitro by drafting behind other competitors or touching a floating dreidel. In fact almost touching it is good enough. The boost will put you at your top speed in an instant rather than slowly increasing speed or shooting you forward, so its just as useful to use the boost when you've got the minimum or maximum amount. In other words, just hold down that boost button. If you ever fall off a track or stray too far from the path, you can use a respawn button. There is optional full mouse camera support and even a free aim button so you can target another competitor.Like all cart combat games you have weapons. In this case there are two buttons to use a weapon in front or behind you. Its shallow in term of weapon variety and you get them by driving through hovering boxes. There is a bubble shield, a boxing glove, a pink love robot that will follow and then hug on the nearest driver until it explodes. You can also get a mine to drop, and a tornado that will throw anyone caught in its winds. Ice blocks will freeze an enemy and send them gliding forward with no ability to turn. Even frozen in ice, their tires will spin, so that feels like an overlooked detail.Perhaps the most context sensitive item to use is the spring that lets you jump. While the spring can be used to jump over things, I consider this to be more useful for doing backflips and barrel rolls to get more boost. When you're in the air with any jump, you have full tilt control of your vehicle.If you're all alone you can play with bots, but victories feel hollow without a single player campaign or cup of any sort. You can setup quick matches and assign the fifteen events you want to play. With the quick matches its just you and three other bots playing the same even twice for whatever reason before you progress to the next map. You can always setup a more complex server, but it takes a bit longer.In terms of customization, you have a lot to chose from. Your car, your gear, your helmet and your face wear. Everything is customization and adds a lot of silly character to the game to make you stand out from the pack online. You can be a hovering brain wearing a clown nose with blonde pig tails driving a boat car. A nice option is randomization, so you can end up with a pink squid wearing a moon helmet driving a bomb with spike tires. Speaking of spike tires, when you use them, you can tell if you let off the accelerator the tires stop completely even if you continue to move forward.As for the tracks themselves, the races are all closed circuits with only two or three laps. The shortest course has eight laps, but it feels like a strict circle.The driving surfaces are needlessly wide so the focus is more on the weapons instead of the driving skill. Each course has a few ramps and jumps here and there. You'll even go down a bumpy ski slope, a wavy slide and a water slide. Each course is bright and colorful. Its all very appealing to the eyes to make that quick fun joy ride feeling.There's a lot of creativity with the courses, a pool and water slide, driving on a billiard tapble that connects to an air hockey course. Even the standard race track circuit shows a lot of flair. The desert themed track has you racing outside and then through a crystal mine across wooden roads. The creativity and effort shows, but the thing that holds the design back in my eyes are the lack of hazards. There's a dirt stadium that could use some slowing mud. These wide tracks just need something else on them like a shallow river. The water park has a lot of water, but it has no affect on you even if the water slide can rotate you backward as you go down..Then there are quirky events such as the basketball, American and European football events that have you trying to score a goal with a gigantic sports ball. While I like the idea, the practice of it in Zero Gear is lacking, its dull and imprecise. Speaking of dull, nothing can trump the tag chase event in terms of boredom. The tag chase has a timer where only one person's time increases. The one that fills their meter first wins the event. Well this takes forever, because everyone else's meter goes down. To make things interesting, the mode will change where the one that is it will decrease in time, making a long mode even longer. These cars are so tiny on such an open wide map that its tough to tag anyone. If the person that's it falls off the level, its up for grabs in the center again.While a lot of the other events are fun and unique, they feel thrown together such as the pachinko and skeeball games. These are simple games based on points. You use your car to drive off a cliff or ramp and fall down into the pachinko or fly into the skeeball. The skeeball feels like skill, the pachinko feels like dumb luck. This is strictly filler content to flaunt as a frill.There is controller support, just not in the menus. Default controls needed to be adjusted because some of the buttons were forgotten about. Even adjusting the controls, there is no menu button to adjust, so there's no pause with a controller. In fact there is no pause, because an online game keeps going even with bots. Instead there's a menu with no way to rebind the menu.Zero Gear feels like it can benefit from from better events and a single player series of races against more intelligent opponents. There is something good here, but it needs to go deeper and bigger. More weapons, more races, more hazards. I'm sure it was fun when its multiplayer was still alive, but with such a small budget game, I wonder how alive it ever was. The game lives and dies on its multiplayer. Judging from the 25% of people with the first achievement, people went into the game, saw that its multiplayer only and went right back out.			"

												This game is kind of fun with many different game modes (some are very boring, others not so much.) The thing is, you can't play in single player if you aren't connected to the internet which means you have to be connected  to the internet at all times in order to play. honestly, that is the main reason I dislike this game. the graphics are OK, however, the colors on some maps are way too bright; I had to adjust the color settings on my monitor (I would go blind otherwise).

-Quick Review-Zero Gear is an indie Racing game, the community is pretty much dead, but if you don't feel like you've had enough kart games, here you go, just for you.Disclaimer: I'm voting it down *not* because it's a bad game, but because the community is dead, you will play by yourself 9 times out of 10. (Maybe you don't mind that? Maybe you want to play a racing game by yourself? Go ahead and get it, lol)-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  Instead of a telling the gist of the story (there is none) I'm going to tell my own story. The first time I loaded this game I listen to the soundtrack and though ""Woa! This sound really good"" I called my brother over and said ""doesn't that sound like it has good potential?""I clicked ""quick game"" and BAM all my hopes and dreams were crushed... This was in fact... a racing game.To provide a back story, I've always strongly disliked racing games and driving games. But Saints Row 3, Mafia 2, and Just Cause 2 have all forced me to learn how to drive in video games.Game Play: The first game I played was some type of ""Soccer"" (or ""Football"" for those whom aren't in the USA), this is probably the worst game in the batch. There are several game modes: Tag, Race, and Soccer. All of these can be played and learned, however it takes a bit of getting used to the turning style... Much to my frustration when learning the basics of the game.Soccer/Football/Hockey, your goal is to get the ball/puck into the other team's goal (pun intended).Race is where you drive in circles for a few laps and try to beat the NPC's, because humans don't play this game anymore.Tag, for those of you with no childhood; is when you run away from one person because he/she was designated being ""it"", whatever it is, who knows? In this game it's reversed. You WANT to be it, so you can score points and win.Achievements: There are 45 Achievements in Zero Gear, Most of them are easily obtainable, however a number of them are bugged, and still more require the assistance of one friend.Price the price for Zero gear, is $4.99 that's pretty fair, if you really want this game just wait for a steal sale, you can probably pick it up for a couple dollars.Conclusion: AHHH a racing game. *deletes the devil from my computer*Again, I'm giving it the thumbs down because most people probably won't want to spend time playing this game. The game works, and I could go one way or another, but with my friends interest in mind; probably should just skip this game. You could get a more delightful indie games for the same price.			"

												I recommend this game, but there are a few bad things to mention:1.) There's rarely any servers.2.) If you play with friends, and host your own server, there might be major server lag.3.) I think it's been abandoned by the devs, so basically your going to get what you get, and you can't throw a fit.Some upsides:1.) There is currently a dedicated server set up by someone that runs continuously and has almost no server lag.2.) It's extremely fun if you can get a bunch of friends together to play. Imagine Mario Karts, but on PC and focused around online multiplayer.It's probably best to only get it if you have friends you can play with. I think this game is definitely worth the $5.			"

												Zero Gear is one of the best options of games to play casually with lots of friends. You can't exactly say it's a racing game because it is a lot more, you can race, play soccer, play tag, play pachinko, play basketball, hockey, a weird game where you punch other players in a precipice. Yeah, the usual stuff. Oh, and you can do all that with a completely customized car,  in fact, you can customize it the way you want, no need to pucharse anything. The game is really awesome to play with friends, don't even consider playing alone, bots suck and online community is dead, only buy this if you have friends. Zero Gear is full of OMG moments, it is simply incredible to play and provides lots of fun. The game don't try to be realistic, it takes a Mario Kart style aproach with items and stuff. I like the game a lot, my friends also do. Recomended.			"

												The influx of bad reviews is due to the lack of servers, and by I mean ""lack"" of servers, there are none.The gameplay in this is extremely fun, the game modes that don't include traditional racing are crap with bots.So if you know how to port forward the game and have friends to play it with then I highly reccomend buying this game.

												Zero Gear is a multiplayer-focused racing game in which you drive toy cars and try to beat your opponents with a variety of weapons. The game seems fun enough, but I can't really recommend the game as the multiplayer is dead, though. If you are content with racing against bots the game could be something for you.			"

												When racing there is one thing you can't play without.. and that's control. The controls are very touchy and with the low gravity of the physics system yout tires don't seem to touch the ground enough making the control even worse. If I didn't get this game for pennies in a bundle I would be demanding my money back.. I was kinda hoping it would be a fun community game toplay with my friends. I was also hoping that it might borrow more from Mario Kart than it actually makes you think it did in the screenshots. No servers, so you can make your own.. but why bother?			"

												This game is nothing like it appeared to be in the trailer. Steering is terrible in the game, and the physics are a bit off, causing issues when racing. The item box things don't really give you anything useful to use against your opponents. A lot of the stuff cannot even be used as a weapon to interfere with your opponent unless you're literally right up against them. There's also not many weapons in those item boxes. I think I noticed four. Do not expect large games either. There seems to be no single player mode, and it just randomly sticks you into multiplayer with just one person. It gets extremely boring and the challenge dissipates easily. You also cannot pick the game mode you want to play. You randomly either end up in a racing game, or a remake of that carnival game where you throw a little ball down the lane and try to get it in the holes, but you play as the ball. Making characters can be a bit fun, but you're still limited to a select few base designs. There's a custom color editor though, which is a nice touch. This game is a stinker though. Pass on it, believe me. You're better off getting a Wii emulator and playing Mario Kart Wii than wasting money on a wannabe.			"

												This game has so much potential to be great, unfortunately it has just a few flaws that do enough damage to ruin the game. You'll see a lot of people give positive reviews without actually playing the game often. I don't know the origin behind this, maybe they got the game really cheap or free and decided it was worth it and that's all that matters. I bought the four pack for $2, but I won't let that impact my review at all because I see the bigger picture that I'm probably not going to play the game a whole lot, no matter how much I want to try and play the game.The game's positives are many. You have a variety of levels that all have their unique game modes associated to it. Think of it like Mario Kart but much more variety. You have this unique take of Tag where sometimes the person it loses points rather than gains, which is closer to the traditional sense of tag (the person ""it"" would want to tag someone) and then sometimes it gets ""flipped"" where the person it gets points, thus wanting to run away from the other players. If the player reaches zero points, the ability to become it is then in the middle of the map. Additionally, there is weapons in the middle of the map you can gather as well. First player to get a full bar of points wins. You also have this cool soccer ball mode where you obviously got to get the sockerball into the goal using either your own vehicle or a boxing glove to act like a kick. You have racing and probably numerous more. They're all great ideas and were well thought out. The game has a garage menu option where you customize your character and vehicle. Not only do you get to select the stuff your character wears or your vehicle style and its wheels, but you also get to customize everything's color with all colors possible using this box and its slider that adjusts brightness (color grid or something, forgot what it's called). The vehicle styles range from your typical vehicle to a tank, my favorite is the skull vehicle. The wheel options are good as well, some are goofy and some are less goofy. I picked the tires with spikes on them to match my skull car. I have the skeleton character and I made him wear the bugging out eyes and a top hat. Yes, you can even customize the color of your character.The game has an alright soundtrack. It isn't good, it isn't bad. It's just fine. No complaints from me. The graphics style is cartoony, but it's enjoyable for all ages despite it. Now for some of the negatives that absolutely ruins the game, thus its low price and obscurity. The items the game has does have a healthy variety, not to the scale of Mario Kart or even Jak X: Combat Racing, but the variety is fine. I would have liked to have seen more variety however.The items, however, can also ruin the game for the player using them.In the game mode, Flipped, you gotta tag people, remember? Well, with the force shield, nobody can touch you and you cannot touch anyone, so how do you tag people when you need to? Flawed design. The force shield also doesn't protect you from everything but rather the players actual vehicle, so bombs and stuff appear to still hit you... unless that's a bug. Additionally, some weapons help the player you're using them against more than yourself. Bombs, for example, can blow the player forward and they have a fast enough recovery where you still wont catch up to them. Mario Kart did it right where you, despite it being unrealistic, fly upwards more to slow you down. This, I imagine, can be even more frustrating in a racing game where you push a player ahead of you rather than help you. The items could use a bit of a revamp, perhaps even a filter for specific maps. For example, the Kickit map only has punching bags, perhaps flipped should only give the shield to players that can use it for their best interests or not have it at all.The second worst thing about the game is the camera. I use a controller because mouse and keyboard just doesn't make sense for some games, racing being one of them (wheel>controller>mouse and keyboard). However, both mouse and keyboard have this same issue, the camera is just too frustrating. You could reverse and it IMMEDIATELY snaps backwards but sluggishly continues forward. It should be a bit faster snapping towards the direction you're driving. You could try to turn and the camera feels a bit off, it's hard to see where you're going, especially when chasing someone on an open map. You can use the mouse to move the camera, which is actually good. The controller, however, is painfully useless. It's a ♥♥♥♥ing racing game and they somehow made the camera horrible for controller players. The absolute worse of the game that just ruins it entirely, no matter how many positives, is the controls. The controls make the game so unplayable that you'll have to relearn everything you have ever gotten from driving games. The turning specifically. The turn isn't imemdiate, there is input lag. This input lag is frustrating. It makes timing really hard. You know what's worse? The way the turns work. You LUNGE left or right. There isn't a good system of turning because there isn't an easy way to turn slightly left or right, you'll probably zig zag around stuff you're trying to get because of it. There is jumping and *kinda* drifting that *kinda* makes things easier, but not by enough. You'll have to invest a lot of time to get used to the game and even then I don't think you'll fluently be able to drive to what you are targeting. Online community doesn't exist. No players online. That's probably because of the turning controls and what not. When hosting your own game, I notice that, even as host, I lag with my friend. I only had problems with him, so that suggests that maybe there is some type of connection similar to Super Smash Brothers Brawl. That's not a good thing, especially since it causes not just me but my friend to teleport, reset all over the place, or go under the map. That's not something the host should go through. If the developer would invest the time to, at least, fix the camera and controls to be less frustrating, the game would be able to get sales, easily, without having to sell a 4 pack for $2. However, the game seems to be dead both online and the developer side. I really like the idea, but I refuse to say it's worth buying no matter how many laughs I had with my friends because I was more frustrated with the controls than I was having fun. Not to mention the laughs my friends and I were making were more related to how bad and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t the game is. If you're adventureous, you might wanna try buying the game on sale to experience it yourself. If you're looking for a good PC Mario Kart or something, look elsewhere because this is not it.edit: to update, this game is still ♥♥♥♥. However, my friends and I never touch it because other games, like Rocket League, are better. Don't bother with this.			"

												I've been asked time and time again to review this game simply because of the controversy it has. I want to say before I review this I am a straight non white male and I have checked my privilege . Ok now that we have that out the way let's start the review. Zero Gear Solid: interplanetary Global Warfare is a multiplayer racing game with a strong single player that has layers of depth that I've never seen in a video game before.THE STORY: There is two factions the blue which fight for equal rights for all races, genders, and sexual orientations. The red fights only for the white straight privilege and for political freedom for the panda race which has recently been discovered in a secret lab in naughty Korea. The pandas have superior brain function and can rationalize thoughts before we can and they have decided that we settle the war in a test of strength and will power. THE ZERO GEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The Zero  Gear is the missing link between kart racing games and Gone Home because you either win the series a hero or go home a lesbian CIS scum.THE GAMEPLAY: The game play is superb, the combat is a mix between counter strike and the CQC from Metal Gear Solid 3: The Twin Snakes. You start out with 2 weapons a gun and a knife, the gun is dependent on your rank and which team you spawn as. If you have just started red will have a 1911 with a switch blade while blue will have a glock and a Ninjatō. They both have their pros and cons but blue is a bit stronger in my opinion with their strong CQC take down. The driving is really like you're driving a kart!  The turning is tighter than a 3-year-old and the drifting is like real-life  You can't  .THE SOUNDTRACK: The soundtrack was produced by none other than Aphex Twin! unfortunately they could only afford one full length song so that's what you get. There is shorter snippets and those produced by my homie Madlib. On the soundtrack I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this one, if you've heard the soundtrack what did you think of it? Love it? Hate it? Why? The Soundtracks for the Zero Gear over the Court of the Crimson Trout Mask..............................Forever.OVERALL: I think this a pretty fun game for 99 cents but anything above that is kinda eeeeeeeehhhhhhhhhhh. This game is fun with the mates and LANing it would stop the lag issues. I'm feeling a solid 7 on this one.PROS:FUN WITH MATESDEEP STORYCAN MAKE A PANDA DRIVING A SHOE WITH SHOE WHEELSCONS:LAG SPIKES CAN PUT YOU FROM 1ST PLACE TO LAST♥♥♥♥ING DEV ABANDONED THIS GAME ;_;ONLY A COUPLE MAPS AND NO MOD SUPPORT			"

												Actually pretty good game.The developers seem to have abandoned it to work on iOS trash, and there's hardly ever anyone online, but there is a custom map-making tool and a bunch of custom fan-made characters and hats and stuff out there.The racing isn't as ""tight"" as Mario Kart or Sonic Allstars (well, at least it doesn't have boatin' and flyan), yet it is good fun, and since all movement is physics-based, arena modes like football or tag can be heaps of joy.The game officially supports 8 players, but just change that one variable in the server.txt and you can play with up to 15 friends online.The lack of splitscreen is a minus.

												I went into this game expecting a mix between little big planet and mario kart. To keep it short, it is neither. It's a basic racing game with power-ups that barely work and are uninteresting. There are no more online servers, so I was playing against bot the whole time. Was getting a bit bored, but then...SOCCER WITH CARS! The concept has grasped me since the dawn of ""Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars"" and I've wanted something like this ever since. They did it on Top Gear and now I can do it n my PC! The mode is great fun, but nothing like the playstation game. You get an arena and a boxing glove power-up. If you have a playstation, get the supersonic game. If you don't this might entertain you. But not more than 99 cents worth.			"

This game doesn't just have racing maps but also mini games and each map loads relatively quickly. It's not fun by yourself. You definitely need a group of friends on Skype or Teamspeak or whatever. Once you have that you guys will definitely have fun for a few hours.			"

												Zero Gear is a multiplayer kart racing game with only 1 active server left. It's basically a clone of Mario Kart, but Zero Gear does offer different modes, customization and some other small features. The racing, however, is terrible. I don't know if this game is aiming to be a realistic kart game, or just another arcade racer, but in any case; it just doesn't work. I lost count of how many times I *tried* to collect a power-up, only to miss it 80% of the times. 'What ?! That's ridiculous !' I kept telling myself. 'Maybe with some practice', I thought. Well, that helped only a little unfortunately.If you release a kart racer where you can't even properly race then you basically know it's a waste of time. Zero Gear = waste of time.[Rating: 47/100]			"

It's also multiplayer-only, which means unless you like playing with stupid-as-pies AI, you're ♥♥♥♥ out of luck because it's a virtual ghost town. So in summary, why not put on your cargo shorts, waddle down onto the comic book shop, and play pretend with the Warhammer 40k miniatures? It's more fun than this is going to be.			"

												One of the worst racing games I have ever seen in my life! It looks like a PSP game or even a PS2 game!The gameplay makes no sense, multiplayer matches and hosting is awfull! And to be honest, just buy any old Need For Speed title and it would be better than this!! But if it was meant for children, I understand and it's OK, but if you're a teen or adult, don't buy this game it's a waste of your money.			"

												THIS IS THE MOST VILE GAME ON STEAMThey made a special level which appears every christmas, YOU DRIVE A TRUCK INTO A GERMAN CHRISTMAS MARKETIt only comes in 8 bit so be prepared for your eyes to bleed as soon as you curse yourself with this gameMy sister played this and became possessed, steam support said they can't helpIts called Zero Gear but you can change gears, ruins the immersion of the gameThere is no diversity in this game, there isn't ONE Pakistani character in the game who let this game on steam!!!This game gave me flashbacks of when my dad drove over my jaw to get my tooth out as a childThe game comes pre-installed with a trojan that melts your motherboard!!!I vomited when i saw the main menu, my uncle came in the room and vomited over me!! I now have chemical burns all over my face. ... Thanks Zero GearAnd thats why I'm giving this game a positive review. "

												Right, so first things first, if that trailer doesn't make you feel insaaaaaaane then.... well, actually, thats understandable. Zero Gear is probably one of the funniest racing games I have ever played. I have never played a mario kart game in my life, due to the fact I own nothing intendo, but I have always wanted to play one. I found this waaaaaaaay back when they had a free weekend of this to promote their game, and I gave it a go. I will never regret that day.I had soooo much fun online, back when it worked, and I pooped in my pants every once in a while because I laughed so hard. Now days I don't do that so much, but i still manage a fart whenever I play this game.The tracks are awesome, some better than others. The racing is the best. The AI is top notch. The vehicle customisation is state-of-the-art. And the PHYSICS in this game is far more advanced than the physics that occupy this world currently. I mean, how many times can you slightly nudge your friend ever-so-lightly on the back of his car, THEN HE FLIPS, AND CRIES, AND ♥♥♥♥♥ ALL IN THE SAME SWIFT MOVEMENT?!?! that's right, you can't, but this game makes it possible.Now, I dont write a lot of reviews, so, you can trust me on this. Zero Gear is where I have had most of my laughs in gaming. I used to laugh at a lot of stuff back when I was younger, now I find things relatively hard to laugh at if it isnt extremely funny. Like ducks for example, I barley laugh at those anymore. Anyway, If you are looking for a racing game with great graphics, excellent car handling, a solid NFS story, an aboriginal, several quails, and realistic... well... realism, then LOOK ELSEWHERE.However, if you are looking for a game with good laughs, great fun, extreme competition, rage quitting (when you nudge your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off friend because he hasn't won a race since he started playing), 10/10 -IGN physics, and a good game to play with friends, then ZERO GEAR is the campfire you want to gather around on a cold winters night. Its funny when you play, but most of all, its FUN. I enjoyed it. That guy below me enjoyed it. So why shouldnt YOU enjoy it?Buy it. NOW!LEGIT STUFF NOW:As I said, the game is great, and extremely funny, but ONLY if you have about 3-4 friends to play this with. Bots are OK, but you always win and there isnt really a challenge.PROS:-Very funny-Lots of different tracks/maps-Lots of different game modes-Good customization-Graphics are good for the style and time of the game-Very quirky and fun-Awesome powerups-BOTS in multiplayer (If you would like. Personally, I enjoy having them)-AWESOME music-THE PHYSICSCONS:-No online play (Thats why you HAVE to have friends to play this game with)-Some maps are very long and boring (these are far a few between though)-Sometimes it gets laggy-No developer input-No community-Bot AI is sometimes really f*cking weird.... sometimes...-THE PHYSICSOverall and EXCELLENT game. Very fun but only with friends. No community or online play (Servers).9/10 (Because sometimes the physics can really ♥♥♥♥ you off)If you would like to see a bit of the fun I have had in zero gear, go to the link below. Otherwise, try it for yourself, but make sure you have a few mates willing to try it out with you. Thanks.

												This game is just pure all out FUN! Loaded the game up for the first time and played with friends with ease, went on to play the game for almost 2 hours. The game has some really fun team based games (Ice Hockey, Basketball etc) as well as some good race tracks and battle areanas. If you want a game that is as fun as Mario Kart but that you can play with friends on the PC, this is totally the game to get, I have tried a good amount of these types of games and this one is by FAR the best out there.Go buy this game and have fun with it.

												There is a reason they are giving it away for free. There is not a single person playing this multiplayer cart racer. The character customization is awesome and the best part of the game. I chose a gentleman cactus riding a tank. The racing mechanics are pretty bland. They don't tell you there is a different button to drop the item, and a different button to shoot the same item, which goes against any other racing game. They should make it more clear. Most of the items are just droppables that you can also shoot, then there are worthless items like the spring. There is a shield but since there, for some reason, isn't a way to look back you don't know when to use it so its worthless. There are a lot of levels and game modes which is nice. Problem is although levels look different, there aren't any obstables or level specific things, its just what you are riding on changes. They should have taken note from Mario Kart. So you just drive around and go off jumps. Driving mechanics are poor. You take super wide turns and can't quick turn if you are stopped. Also most times you land you just spin out for some reason, or if you just tap the wall. Also going up a ramp and coming back down you can't turn in the air, so you just land and stop, which makes no sense. There are modes like tag and soccer, which are cool. unfortunately the bots suck and will for some reason your teamates will take the soccer ball/basketball/etc, away from the opponents side and push it towards yours (derp?). Not much to see here. 4.5/10			"

												What is a game without players? An easy time against bots. That's what. I remember when this game first came out. Servers with people galore. Now it's so barren, tumbleweeds won't even blow across. I wish I had played more during the good ol' days. But the game itself is fun. A good time killer. Soccer is my favourite.			"

												There is a reason they are giving it away for free. There is not a single person playing this multiplayer cart racer. The character customization is awesome and the best part of the game. I chose a gentleman cactus riding a tank. The racing mechanics are pretty bland.

												This game is awesome and so underrated, it's nothing on par with Mario Kart or any high league essentric racing game but it certainly has it's pros and cons, the art style is quite childish and easy on the eyes, nothing too visually intense but soft graphics that help alongside the giggles and laughs that you'll get when playing this as, with the right people, friend or randoms, this game has many diverse gametypes you'll never see anywhere else, there's even a ice rink you have to get a giant puck into the net, it's amazing, for the little tiny price, I'd say get it, it won't let you down.

												Right, so first things first, if that trailer doesn't make you feel insaaaaaaane then.... well, actually, thats understandable. Zero Gear is probably one of the funniest racing games I have ever played. I have never played a mario kart game in my life, due to the fact I own nothing intendo, but I have always wanted to play one. I found this waaaaaaaay back when they had a free weekend of this to promote their game, and I gave it a go. I will never regret that day.I had soooo much fun online, back when it worked, and I pooped in my pants every once in a while because I laughed so hard. Now days I don't do that so much, but i still manage a fart whenever I play this game.The tracks are awesome, some better than others. The racing is the best. The AI is top notch. The vehicle customisation is state-of-the-art. And the PHYSICS in this game is far more advanced than the physics that occupy this world currently. I mean, how many times can you slightly nudge your friend ever-so-lightly on the back of his car, THEN HE FLIPS, AND CRIES, AND ♥♥♥♥♥ ALL IN THE SAME SWIFT MOVEMENT?!?! that's right, you can't, but this game makes it possible.Now, I dont write a lot of reviews, so, you can trust me on this. Zero Gear is where I have had most of my laughs in gaming. I used to laugh at a lot of stuff back when I was younger, now I find things relatively hard to laugh at if it isnt extremely funny. Like ducks for example, I barley laugh at those anymore. Anyway, If you are looking for a racing game with great graphics, excellent car handling, a solid NFS story, an aboriginal, several quails, and realistic... well... realism, then LOOK ELSEWHERE.However, if you are looking for a game with good laughs, great fun, extreme competition, rage quitting (when you nudge your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off friend because he hasn't won a race since he started playing), 10/10 -IGN physics, and a good game to play with friends, then ZERO GEAR is the campfire you want to gather around on a cold winters night. Its funny when you play, but most of all, its FUN. I enjoyed it. That guy below me enjoyed it. So why shouldnt YOU enjoy it?Buy it. NOW!LEGIT STUFF NOW:As I said, the game is great, and extremely funny, but ONLY if you have about 3-4 friends to play this with. Bots are OK, but you always win and there isnt really a challenge.PROS:-Very funny-Lots of different tracks/maps-Lots of different game modes-Good customization-Graphics are good for the style and time of the game-Very quirky and fun-Awesome powerups-BOTS in multiplayer (If you would like. Personally, I enjoy having them)-AWESOME music-THE PHYSICSCONS:-No online play (Thats why you HAVE to have friends to play this game with)-Some maps are very long and boring (these are far a few between though)-Sometimes it gets laggy-No developer input-No community-Bot AI is sometimes really f*cking weird.... sometimes...-THE PHYSICSOverall and EXCELLENT game. Very fun but only with friends. No community or online play (Servers).9/10 (Because sometimes the physics can really ♥♥♥♥ you off)If you would like to see a bit of the fun I have had in zero gear, go to the link below. Otherwise, try it for yourself, but make sure you have a few mates willing to try it out with you. Thanks.

												This game is just pure all out FUN! Loaded the game up for the first time and played with friends with ease, went on to play the game for almost 2 hours. The game has some really fun team based games (Ice Hockey, Basketball etc) as well as some good race tracks and battle areanas. If you want a game that is as fun as Mario Kart but that you can play with friends on the PC, this is totally the game to get, I have tried a good amount of these types of games and this one is by FAR the best out there.Go buy this game and have fun with it.
