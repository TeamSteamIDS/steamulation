Early Access Review
								Robot city stadium is the most fun I've had in multiplayer with my VIVE.   It's like a Tron-esque disk battle arena with many cool play elements. It has an easy to use matching system that pairs you with a player or AI bot of your skill level, and you are just immediately throwing disks and scoring points to the cheers of robo-citizens.  The throwing mechanic is very nuanced, allowing skill to play a huge part in the action.  I have a feeling that as I play I will discover all the tricks for controlling the disk.  My kids were able to pick up the concept without coaching and I was anxious for them to give this seasoned FPS player a second (and third and fourth...) turn.I feel like the replay value is high on this title and with a pure multiplayer experience and varied strategies, this early access game is one to watch.

								Robot City Stadium is a pretty cool Tron inspired competitive multiplayer game.  In many ways it reminds me of other skill based competitive multiplayer games like Paddle Up or Pool Nation (when playing with someone else and not just goofing off) but instead of adapting a real competitive sport to VR, this game takes advantage of VR to create a different virtual sport with elements and factors that can't be found in real life, yet still require a great deal of skill and muscle memory to get good at.  The gameplay is challenging at first, but rewarding once you find a throw that works for you.   The reflective walls also add an interesting Pong-like element to the game, making bouncing discs off walls to fluster opponents a viable tactic in losing track of the opponent's disc.  I can see a lot of potential in this title, as the core mechanics are simple to learn but difficult to master.  I especially like how the AI works as a filler while waiting for another opponent, since that means as long as there is at least one person playing  you'll be able to get into a game.  Overall I'm pretty happy with this title and I think it'll be great to watch a community form around this game :P "

								Yes! Yes! Yes! Since I was 6 years old I've been waiting to be inside a tron style disc battle. Finally the wait is over and boy is this game fun. Today was launch day and I was able to play with one of the devs and in that time two updates rolled out squashing some early access bugs. So yes this game is being activity developed and you shouldn't hesitate to give Robot City Stadium a try. The more people playing online the more beatings I can dish out. Who wants some?			"

								This game is really fun to play!  I like how the disc throwing works, and it seems like you could get crazy good with some practice.  Having AI is nice.  I can totally see myself playing this a ton.  Would recommend.			"

								I'm only a few matches in, but having a TON of fun playing. The feeling of being the stadium is really cool, and I actually feel like it's a whole new ""real"" sport. Took me awhile to nail throwing the discs with the curve I wanted, but now I'm pretty good at nailing my opponent with a disc!Super excited to continue playing, watch the playerbase grow, and play with better and better people! Looks like they already have tournaments planned so excited to participate in that!			"

								I just recently got on Steam because of the Vive.  I really enjoyed playing this and my kid and my neighbor's kids REALLY loved playing this.  They couldn't believe how much fun they had.  Here's a choice quote from my 12-year-old neighbor ""I think I'm going to cry""  (in a good way)He also hit me in the stomach pretty good and knocked a phone out of his mom's hands- the perils of VR, I guess :) "

								Love it!  This is like Discs of Tron meets Rocket League in VR.  Love the graphics, love the controls.  Despite some minor issues (mostly networking-related) it's way more polished and playable than you would expect from an early access game.			"

								Do not buy this if you have an Oculus Rift and you are right-handed...there is no way to switch hands. Seems like it could be a fun game if more people played and it allowed me to play with my dominant hand.			"
