												THIS GAME USES DRM OF THE WORST KIND. You've been warned.The dev doesn't care about this version anyway, he just works on mobile ports now. Guess that's where the real money is nowadays. NSS5 is still kinda fun, but the game has huge amount of small problems (completely broken match rating system, the game's too easy).NSS5 is still better than 4 (in which the dev tried to use a 3D engine and failed miserably) but it's just not worth any money. Get NSS3 or 2.			"

												Urgh, this is just a terrible game.  I enjoyed the mobile game until the developer got greedy and turned it into a pay to win game, I played some of the older NSS PC games and found them to be challenging but fun...This version feels lifeless, a grind against a ruthless manager and players that have as much vision as a 15 year old labrador with cataracts.  As a player you feel like you're a golf cart with the slow turning speed and wide turning circle.  You can use your ability to read the game to make through balls which can set your team up with a scoring chance and possibly even praise from your manager.  This is something that your fellow teammates  cannot do, when you call for the ball they go straight to your feet, since this isn't immediate in some cases you have to turn yourself (golf cart) back into the position you were in and by that time the play is dead and in most cases the ball is lost, all your faultI'm sure with more play I'd adapt to the way the game wants me to play it, but in a world of FIFA and PES there is no room for such amateur gameplayThe energy issue is a common problem in modern NSS games.  I lost 40% of my energy on a plane journey to east Europe as part of Europa League game; did I walk?  was I pulling the bus?  So you buy NRG (oops.. stomach cramps!) and it gives you barely enough energy to last an entire game; if you come on as a sub you get barely enough time to get into the game, try to crank the game time up and you get asked to become a premium memberThe developer has fallen far from grace, once a beloved indie developer turned cash hungry EA type wannabe who clearly no longer cares about the PC fan base that gave them their fame			"

												I loved NSS3. What a great game that was. Unfortunately none of the charm of that title remains in the bones of this terrible game. The controls are terrible. The team AI is terrible. The match rating system is terrible. It's like watching a bunch of grade schoolers run around on the field. I cannot recommend this title. I can't even find the words to fully deal with my frustration on how far this series has fallen.			"

												The website for this game series notes that New Star Soccer 2 is popular because it was the last to feature text-based gameplay. That's unsurprising, because the match engine in this is the most clumsy, awkward and rage-inducing one I've ever seen, and I was playing soccer games on a Sega Master System 20-odd years ago. It feels like you need to stand still to receive a pass - not only do team-mates constantly pass well behind your run, but the player has the turning circle of a tank. Having to sign up for an account just to start a game adds to the frustration.			"

												Even though the trailer does make it look somewhat ridiculous and not very soccer based, the fast based gameplay is very gripping and the gameplay becomes addictive in a flash. Once you get over the initial rookie problems, such as the relatively unwieldy controls and pace of game, it pulls you in and forces you to play for hours. Fantastic game.			"

You play games, you make money, spend money, time, and energy on fans, romantic interests and fellow teammates. You also need to maintain a relationship with your manager! The ""gameplay"" itself isn't amazing, it's not easy to actually play the ingame matches and be a star player but it's not bad.			"

												I'll give NSS5 that, it's a relatively enjoyable game. The match gameplay is reminiscent of Sensible Soccer and other early 90's, and definitely works in a retro kind of way. The resource managing outside of matches helps build the game into a slightly larger, funner experience. All in all, NSS5 is a charming game that promises a few hours of fun.The drawback, however, is that the game is kind of a poorly designed, buggy mess. Save files get corrupted left and right, the game freezes with alarming regularity, and the puzzling online requirement tends to make starting new games a chore (hot tip: If you happen to buy it and struggle starting a game because of connectivity issues, edit the Settings\Settings.txt file. Change the line nettimeout=5 to nettimeout=100).All in all, I can't recommend it. There's not enough here to defend the crippling issues the game has, and definitely not enough to defend their pricing point. Steer clear.			"

												This is an amazing game!  Just like any real life sport... the more you practice, the better you get.  This is true in this game, which is where the leveling up really increases the enjoyment factor.  Yes, you don't start out a super-star, your not, you are a rookie, but as you play it, and you improve your abilities, you become one.  As you become a super-star, not only are you winning your games, but you are living the life.  One of my favorite parts of this game, is how it includes off-the-field perks of being an athlete, and lets you live the life.  Great great game, for all the good-sport, sports-enthusiasts out there.  The game gives you several control options, my favorite, that worked well for me, was the 'game controller'.			"

												This game had incredible potential due to its extremely detailed and deep simulation mechanics. For example, drinkng too much energy drink before a game will cause your player to have stomach cramps during the match.           Sadly, the only part of the game that is solid is the life-simulation/managment portion of this game. The actual soccer-playing gameplay falls flat because of the extremely clunky controls and poor on-field presentation. Problems include that there is only one speed your player can go at (no sprinting vs walking), aiming is near impossible while running, and heading just dosen't work.  Also, the game makes your eyes hurt like hell after an hour, as the players are tiny and so is the ball. Staring at a bright green field that fills the entire screen dosen't help, my eyes felt dead after around an hour of playing. TL;DR: The on-field portion of this game being bad prevents the enjoyment of the surrounding complex life-sim mechanics. Stick to the mobile version, if you don't mind the grind.			"

You will struggle playing on a keyboard.3 - Signing in sometime's will not connect  DRM .4 - Abandoned long ago so there is no support.5 - Old style graphics and play styleI came across a few bugs in 40 hours but none that was game breaking, I quite enjoyed this as it was a simple gamewhich reminded me of a old playstation 1 footie game.It has a few things to do like training skills/skill shots, going to the races and betting on horses, gambling at the casino and buying luxury items and properties.For a 9.99 price tag this lets the reviews go sour which is fair enough as this is way over priced to the extent you are going to feel ripped off.Get this for under £4 and it's a bargin for an old style footie game !!!!

Posted: December 29, 2015
												This is an okay game with a bunch of flaws, but fairly easy to win once you have the hang of it and can be fun especially if you played games like footballer of the year back in the day, this is very much an update of that where you actually play the game in full (if abbreviated) rather than just shooting at the goal.You start off as a lowly footballer who can't shoot, pass, run, dribble or anything. Day by day you can practise, buy toys, go out with the girlfriend (if you have one), try to build up a rapport with your team mates, fans, or boss, etc. Initially the main thing is to build the skills and you do training drills where you have to bend the ball, beat defenders, tackle, dribble around cones, etc. in a limited amount of time/attempts, if you do your skills when you play games improve in the appropriate area.In terms of playing matches you start off as a sub only having a few minutes, and maybe not being picked at all. Based on doing well in various in game stats you try to get good game ratings, which will get you picked more often, or even a starting position in the team if you keep doing well. At this point you start to having to manage your energy by buying toys to keep you occupied during matches, NRG drinks (which often give you cramps during a game), etc. You also need to spend energy managing relationships if you want your teammates to pass to you, your girlfriend not to dump you, your friends not to hate you, etc. So you get into a balancing act of all these things, and you have to learn how to play the minigame puzzles (pair matching for relationships, ""simon says"" for the media), etc.The main in game challenge isn't really about winning matches, once you know the AIs weaknesses this is fairly easy (for example the quick turn to lure defenders into sliding tackles to clear the way, the banana dribble close to the goalie to lure him out and then walk the ball into the net, the direct vertical run outside the goal to curl into the same side top corner, the diagonal curling out/in balls, etc.). The problem instead is trying to use the match to improve your ranking and stats - so doing lots of safe passing in your own half to build up teammate approval without spending energy, getting some tackles in without getting cards, and otherwise building up your stats for passing/tackles/set pieces to increase your transfer value and wages higher, etc., as the benefit from just scoring more and more goals and winning games is capped - you have to become more rounded to be the best.Overall the game is quite good fun at times, although it can be frustrating as well, and your team mates need a lot of managing/adaptation to actually be useful to you given how braindead they are, and the out of match stuff makes for a reasonably interesting balancing act. Once you are successful it does all become fairly formulaic however, as once you are fully skilled up and have largely capped out your relationships it is relatively easy to deal with any new off the field problems, and winning matches/championshops/cups is a breeze once you have the skills and know the AIs strengths and weaknesses. I am not sure I would recommend it to most people however at full price, as I doubt most will play it for long enough to really justify the price tag, and apparently it hasn't been on sale for over a year at this point, but this could be a fun game if you like the idea (and have a controller!) and can put up with some bugs/flaws.

Due these lacks of any innovation the game quickly will let you bored and make you remember how good NSS3 was.But the worst thing, and the main reason that really makes this game not worth buying today is that the developer practically abandoned the main version for PC after he started to develop to mobiles, so don't expect updates or more support any time (maybe never).

There can be some annoying bugs but they arenbt game breaking. Once you get down to gameplay its actually good fun and it makes for a nice little pick up and play football experience. I find though that playing for a long time can become boring and very repetetive. Graphics are 2D but its style is good very similar to old skool Title Sensible Soccer.

												Fun little soccer game, I'm playing it to create a basis for a future character in Football Manager, however there are a few gripes.probably the most glaring problem is that your teammate AI can be unreliable; like they'll run straight at the other team's player and get tackled, rather than try dodging or passing the ball.Your coach can be bi-polar sometimes with his game and post-game comments.ball hit-box is a little funny sometimes, where you won't 'catch' the ball when you thought you would.The refs though are pretty accurate, even though the game doesn't explain what constitutes a yellow flag (I had to actually look up what they give them for and make a guess)Don't expect matches to be upwards of 90 minutes either, maximum is only ~15 minutes for a regular match.If you can get past all that though, you're in for a cute little time-waster.

There is a summary at the bottom in case you don't want to read a text wall for whatever reason.New Star Soccer 5 features a decent soundtrack, a basic menu that has a tad bit of a learning curve and simple gameplay  that requires a bit of finesse.The game starts with the player creating a character and choosing a team. After following the tutorial, the player can join in matches against the AI teams. During matches, the player can be penalized and even injured preventing them from playing in the next few matches. After the matches are completed, the player gains funds and can gain/lose reputation among various factions e.g. boss, team, friends, etc.If the player is not favorable among factions, there is usually some form of consequence on the player, such as a lower ""happiness rating"", which affects their character's playing performance. The player may participate in mix-and-match mini-games to boost the reputation of factions.The player may spend their funds in the shop on various items. The vast majority of the items contribute to ""lifestyle rating"" which aids in finding a girlfriend, which drastically increases the ""happiness rating"" of the character.The player may also participate in training to boost the character's stats, which helps in their overall performance during matches.One of the most amusing aspects of New Star Soccer 5 is the Leader Board. From the Leader Board, you can see your global ranking compared to other players. This makes things competitive, as you can strive to be the #1 player of New Star Soccer 5, globally.Summary:New Star Soccer 5 is a simple, mildly entertaining game with various features. I recommend this game, but I advise you to try out the free version that is available on the website first. This will allow you to see if $15 is a good value for being able to play the game infinitely each day.			"

												NSS5 is a football life 'simulator' where you create a player and play football in any one of a ridiculous number of nations and your national team too.The teams are based on real teams, so anyone with basic footballing knowledge should be able to tell that Stamford FC are Chelsea and that Gunners are Arsenal. Your starting team determines your starting skill and wage, your skill can be improved by doing training sessions that range from boring to infuriatingly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥zzle. When not training or playing you are either improving relationships with people you don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about so that you don't become depressed, drinking when you do become depressed, or failing to get girlfriends because they dont like your lifestyle. This part of the game hits close to home and makes me cry.When you do get big money you can use it to buy stuff to impress women and buy PEDs which make you a better player, you can also abuse sponsorship deals for stat increasing boots and other gear. When you level up and start scoring for fun you can then demand funny money to spend on more pointless stuff that no-one would ever buy. Oh a gold chain for £2000? I forgot it was 1988 and I was Slick Rick.The game has some always online feature that allows you to play with other players' avatars in matches which despite the fact that I play for a 4th division Scottish team always seems to be 6'8"" black guys named Devarious Le'shintrella. The servers are also complete♥♥♥♥♥and break all the time meaning that you just play against AI characters instead.Game is fairly fun but the fact that I always wanted to be a footballer and have a girlfriend mean that playing this game makes me self-harm and drink a lot of alcohol in real life whilst I force my player to be an alcoholic too because I never got to be a footballer and don't have a girlfriend.Don't play if you're depressed.P.s. if you're reading this and a girl pls add me on steam I promise to send gifts <3			"

												A nice rpg/soccer game for people who grew up with soccer games of 80s and early 90sPros:+ Gameplay (Matches): Similar to Sensible Soccer serie of Amiga era. Sensible Soccer gameplay was great compared to Kick Off 2 since KO2 was too fast for my taste. (Hint: Teenagers and Fifa era players stay away, you wont get the fun of it.)+ Gameplay (Rpg/Sim): Transferring yourself, training stuff, buying things and managing personal life adds a great flavour to the game.+ Art: Actual matches looks too similar to Sensible World of Soccer with great animation, crowd and weather effect add-on.Cons:- Sound: Music is bad. Sfx does its part on matches but could have been far better.- DRM system: Signing on to a server (which fails to connect most of the time) is not a good idea (PS: You dont have to be signed in to play).- Needs more improvement and rpg flavour (maybe NSS6?)Final verdict:I've spent many fun hours with the game. It was nice remembering my teenage years which wasted on soccer games :) NSS needs its next installment. So far 7/10			"

												This has been one of my favorite games for a long tim e now. I played this game on mobile and had the most fun i ever could have had on a mobile game. But this...this steps it up an entirely different level. There is no doubt this is one of the best soccer games on the market. if it hadn't have been for this game, i never would ahve gotten involved with soccer so much. 10/10-Would Reccomend			"

												It's a fun game but, man, it sure is fast! You might dismiss this game because it doesn't look like FIFA or PES and all, but that would be a mistake. It feels like I'm a real player on a real soccer field playing at real speed. Hopefully I can build up my stats soon so I can keep up with these guys.			"

												Upon first impressions of the screenshots, it's fair to assume that New Star Soccer 5 would be a modern, hopefully deeper attempt at the 90s Sensible Soccer games. Besides the appearance of the match engine, I feel that this game should not be compared to any Sensible Soccer game. New Star Soccer 5 simply does not deliver the same quality of gameplay and overall polish as the 90s favorites.In this game, there is much focus placed on the life of the athlete you play as. You will be able to choose which skills to train in, you will be able to take part in social activities with friends, teammates, and a girlfriend. You will have the chance to build your relationship with your manager and the fans, and you will also be allowed to spend money on many items and properties. Most of the time, the way you must perform these actions is by playing memory games where cards will be flashed with different images on them, then they will then be flipped over and and scrambled, and you will need to match two of a kind. That's all there is to it, and it isn't any fun.The developer chose to implement a DRM-like system of player creation and in-game updates where you must manually create an account with a password on their servers, and every single time the game updates after a match, for example, it tries to connect again to their servers. The problem is that the connection to their servers fails almost every single time the game tries to reach them to save your progress. This means that you will need to retry the connection over and over, until it works, each time the game fails to connect to their servers, and it happens extremely often.The career mode allows for the player to go through a maximum of 20 in-game years, and after that you will need to retire that player and begin a new career with someone new. With your player, you will go through his early development as a teenager all the way to a veteran in his late 30s. There is a simple contract negotiation between you and the clubs, there are transfers, there are relegations and promotions within the leagues, and there are international competitions for both club and country. There are some major flaws with all of these features. Very little of what goes on both in the player's career and on the pitch actually makes any sense. Match ratings are almost totally broken, with the game giving your player a low rating or a high rating apparently not reflecting anything that occurred on the pitch. Your 17 year old player will become club captain and be called up to the national team for doing nearly nothing. It's as if these events were scripted into the programming of the game no matter what you did as a player or how well you played the matches. How well your club performs in cups and championships seems to be artificially altered by more scripted programming, having nothing to do with how well you play or even if you play in the matches at all. Choosing to skip a match and not playing in it makes no difference at all in what happens in the game world or how well your club performs. If the programming of the game wants your club to win or wants you to have whatever random rating, that's exactly what will happen.The way the match engine looks is what drew my attention to this game, and coming from playing the Sensible Soccer games in the 90s, I was hopeful to relive a modern take on those games. I was very disappointed. The match engine has many problems, including those related to your teammates' and opponents' AI. Everything seems scripted and the other players on the pitch will not do more than precisely what they were programmed to do. Asking them to pass you the ball can produce some senseless and ridiculous moments. Every match played is almost identical to the last, and can be won by using the same exact strategy as before. The controls are imprecise and can be frustrating at times. The shooting and passing mechanics perform inadequately and rarely the way you intend. It's also really obvious that the game is intended to be experienced by people playing primarily as strikers, and secondarily as attacking midfielders. Every other position won't make any sense at all. If you want to be part of the action on the pitch, you will need to travel the entire field and play out of position almost always. Even as a striker and as an attacking midfielder, if you actually want to be part of the match, you will need to run all over the place and play out of position a lot of the time. In addition to New Star Soccer 5 having all these problems and looking and feeling like a mobile game, it's just not any fun. There are rarely any moments where your actions will mean actual accomplishments, as the game is playing itself down to all the events it has been scripted to do.New Star Soccer 5 is mediocre.			"

												Pros: its fun The game focuses on your own player to improve its status & become one of the top players in the worldit gets addicting to the point that you just want to make another turn or matchits simple the controls feels like those old SNES soccer games that we lovedCons:No option to make a match longer Pointless online feature that directs you to a 3rd party site in order to sync your player's records For an indie game with this much content its actually good. I like the idea of improving your own player and options to do outside the match because it gives me this RPG vibe. If you're not in a hurry to buy this game its okay to slip it until it goes on sale but yeah, this is surprisingly a fun & addicting game to me.			"

												This may well be one of the worst games I've ever played.Terrible presentation, dreadful AI, mechanics that arbitrarily punish you and mark you down for things that are beyond your contorl and unweildy controls make this game so far from fun it's not even worth playing to see just how bad it really is.I paid £0.83 for this, and that's £0.84 too much. Do yourself a favour and get Sensible World of Soccer from GoG instead. That's how a football game should be done, not this abomination.			"

												It is very fun except some minor issues that gonna make you want to break your controller from time to time. IE: Sometimes, your character dosen't tackle when you want him to, you kick a perfect pass and your teamate miss it,well it's apparently your fault and the coach gonna take points from you because of that. Or you ask a pass from a teamate and he throw it like 3213 meters from you, well that is also your fault. Also, if you interecpt the ball from their goaler to a player, but doing so the ball goes to a player from the other team, well it counts as a bad pass... I highly recommend not having the coach speech on, unless you want to rage at your game all the time.			"

												Although it looks like a simple game, it is really enjoyable and addicting. Along with football/soccer, you also play the life of a football/soccer player. The reality has been implemented via several things such as losing energy while going to play away, not ignoring the girlfriend, making the papers due to sensational events, earning from horse-racing more than football/soccer. So it has a pretty comprehensive content.In the game, there are also some events irrelevant to reality like the Premier League championship of a team that have actually never been in the top places of the league, the quarter-finals of UEFA Champions League's including at least one team that actually join to the earlier qualification rounds of the tournament, German National Team's scarcely qualifying out of the qualifications for UEFA European Championship and FIFA World Cup... But these add spice to the taste of the game. :)			"

It can only be played properly with a controller which is still a little bit difficult in the beggining because you use only 2 keys. (Congrats for creativity)			"

												Just awful. First time i have ever seen a game be so far behind its mobile version. Controls are absolutely dreadful, the players energy dissappears so qucikly you can do a tiny amount of training and even then have less than 50 fitness for every game. The entire in game experience is you watching a ball go everywhere but to you, and even when it does your player never actually keeps the ball, it either goes straight through him or he runs over it. In summary, the gameplay even on the few occasions you do have the ball is so bad it is like watching a group of quad amputees compete in a swingball tournament, minus the optimism.			"

												This is posibly the most depressing game I've ever played. I'm not even joking.It's a great reminder that you can't ever win in life. No matter what your abilities are, you'll always be at the mercy of your circumstances.Do well at your job and your co-workers will probably hate you and hinder you at every opportunity - after all, they pursue the same vague idea of glory and prosperity you do. And you only have so much time on this planet and that time, you will learn, is not nearly enough to please even a fraction of the people who matter. The small victories you get every once in a while won't fuel you forever either.Do poorly and everyone will hate you - your family and fans disappointed, your friends and significant other alienated, the press chewing your fat until they decide you're yesterday's news - and then there you are, stuck on the bench with your only friend left: the drink.But of course your boss will always be there to provide a stone cold, insatiable father figure: shouting unhelpful and meaningless nuggets of wisdom like ""Take your time"" and ""Think about when you call"" every step of the way; providing the minimal required amount of reinforcement to your Skinner box of an existence to keep you going.Football is Life, and Life is a Smelly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

												I played this for a good chunk of time. It's a fun little casual game, if you can get past the flaws, and mainly the game flat out not working. Yes, beware. Not every user, but I seen PLENTY of people have an issue where they cannot connect to the servers. And this has been going on for years now! The developer said he is trying to fix it, but so far nothing has changed. I don't know exactly what it is but it seems changing hosts would fix it, I could be wrong. Anyways, if you cannot connect to the game, you CANNOT play from my experience. The only help is to ""keep trying, use a proxy"", and even ""try leaving the game on overnight"" from another forum. (keep trying works until I have to load the game again do to not wanting to play or crashing) which is unacceptable even for an indie game, even made by one person. Don't have online DRM if you can't keep a server working for everyone.Onto the actual gameplay, if you wanna risk the above, or manage to get through (I had a hell of a time) The gameplay is ""aright"" it's a nice unique game, but nothing more than I expect out of a flash game. There is a decent amount of game flaws, but for the most part they can be looked past. I have had the game crash somewhat often as well which is also a downside.The music isn't good at all, and in a top down football game you really need background music thats enjoyable, minor complaint however, doesn't really change much. Overall, I'd say the game is worth $5, however this is BEFORE the connection problems. I don't think this game should even be allowed to be sold on Steam with the current issues of the connecting. As it is preventing plenty of people from playing the game according to forum posts, with no help other then what I mentioned and basically a ""I'll fix it"" years ago. Definitely do not recommend this game, but if you can look past the horrible connection issues, it should provide some fun for a little while.			"

												I have loads of fun playing this game and while it has some huge flaws the main core of the game is good. The bad consists in silly puzzles, loosing ""fame"" even if you had 5 assists in a match and you can only get a girlfriend if you have a certain amount of money. Training also seems a bit off in terms of difficulty, some too easy and others too hard. Prices on players are also non comprehensible.However I did buy this game to play the core of the game and see my youngster rise to the stars, that I have done. He is now at Swansea, has won the world cup for Denmark and is world wide known, everyone wants him but his pricetag is lower than the average premier league footballer, much lower. That did not stop me from buying a joypad and enjoying playing a lot, you control a single player on the pitch and after a few trials I got the hang of it, its fun to score and assist while the coach never seems happy insulting you on every turn.In the rise of ranks I started at the Conference North with Histon... then proceeded to Dag&Red, Exeter and then Swansea. I am mainly enjoying playing the matchesand looking at the statistics, something which also has kept me playing. I can look at my history and check a lot of stuff which I have done in the past.The rest of the game is mediocre at best, some of the stuff seems made for 6 year old kids hence many bad reviews. The price should be a bit lower, around the 5 euro mark, as it is now its a bit too expensive but I would still recommend just for the core play. You can always wait till it comes on sale however. "

												Like stepping back in time about twenty years, this is a Master-System-level game wrapped up in Megadrive-level packaging. Some of the minigames are fun for a while, and the general idea of trying to balance training, games, social life, and other responsibilities in a professional football career is a good one, but ultimately repetitive implementation, odd choice for some mini-games (a higher/lower card guessing game for contract negotiations?) and a match engine 25 years out of date (Sensible Soccer is relatively state-of-the-art) let down what could have been a deep, feature-rich professional footballer career simulator.

												A great arcade football game where you play as only one player at the huge field.You'll be responsible to train your player and make him rich!I can't recommend it enough to football fans.			"

												As a NSS3 player, I feel like this is a significant downgrade. Practice is easy and dull, the game controls worse and with much less precision, the whole experience somehow feels simplified and dumbed down, it misses the charm of NSS3.  I've been hugely disappointed, I didn't get near as much enjoyment out of this game as I did from NSS3 and gave up on it after a few hours - wasted cash.			"

												Love the game on mobile, they've tried to develop it on PC but they've just overcomplicated it and tried to add too much freedom.The reason people love the handheld version is because it is really simple. Now the game allows you to run around throughout the entire game, which in theory sounds good but it's really poor. You call for a pass whilst running and your teammates pass behind you then you get the blame for calling for the pass poorly when in reality you're teammate is to blame for the hideous pass.Trying to head the ball is abysmal too.Once you get the ball, you can go on a lot of dribbles and play some nice passes in to your teammates but it's very difficult to tackle opponents and because your teammates can barely pass to you, you find yourself having played 1 pass throughout a game of 90 minutes.It's cheap so if you enjoy the handheld version, you'll have a voice in your head urging you to buy this. However don't say I didn't warn you!Oh yes, also the game keeps crashing. I've googled the error to no avail. An exception occurs so perhaps the developers need to try and look into what causes the exception to be thrown.			"

												Live the life of an up-and-coming superstar in this unique football career game. Start out as a 16 year old lad and work your way to the top to become a footballing legend! You need to train hard, play matches, make transfers, do interviews, stay in touch with friends, sign sponsorship deals, go to the casino, buy cars, and more! With so many distractions in a footballer's life is it any wonder that so many don't make it? But what about you? Can you become a new star?			"

												I love the idea of managing only one player, doing a carrier etc. and this could have been a good game but in the end it is just super frustrating.Mainly the little guy im suppose to control doesn't do what I want. Oh yes, I could play hours and maybe my skills would increase so much that I could do miracles with the really bad controls but I even doubt so.Somewhat I feel like there is no freedome in this game. It's hard to explain but I feel like the game was developped to be play only the way the devs intended it: the long, frustating, hard way.			"

												I got this game in a bundle and didn't have any expectations whatsoever.  I decided to install it for the hell of it because it was only a few megabytes.  Well here I am six hours later, completely blown away with how entertaining this game turned out to be.Pros: - So much more than just a soccer game (includes casino games, horse racing, mini games, etc.)- Basic graphics than can run smoothly on any computer (think NES/SNES)- Simple controlsCons:- Some of the achievements don't register on Steam (not a big deal for me, but to some people it might be)- Sometimes it can be a little difficult to control your player since the controls really are simpleAll in all I would highly recommend this game. 9/10			"

												This is an arcadey football game with interesting RPG elements.You are playing the part of a single footballer. That's a very refreshing mechanic, which hasn't been used in many other games recently. That makes this game fairly refreshing.There are almost two games feeding into each other: Firstly, there's playing the matches. This is a good, but not stellar, arcade style football game, with a tiled view from behind the goal, similar to the various Amiga games of the 1990s. You just control your own player rather than the whole team. The game is fast-paced and holds your attention. The ""one player"" mechanic is also very different to most other games.Secondly, there's the RPG game. This has you ""levelling up"" your player, maintaining relationships with team mates and friends, saving up for houses, flash cars and the like. You can also do several other things, such as gamble your money at the casino or racetrack. The mini-games providing this are all very simple, but there are a lot of them and they're competently done.The most interesting part comes where the two games overlap. Should you pass to a teammate rather than scoring yourself - because then he'll like you and be more likely to pass to you next time, or do you score yourself because you want the goal bonus to buy some new boots? When scoring a goal, do you celebrate with the fans to improve your relationship with them, or do you celebrate with the manager so he's more likely to pick you next week?I found this interesting and refreshing, and brings some planning and thinking to the arcade-style match engine.If you're wondering whether this is the same game as its more famous cousin on iOS, it's not. This is much more fleshed out and playable, particularly the match engine which is real-time. Incidentally, if you haven't played the iOS version then it's well worth the price.It's worth pointing out that the game is nigh-on impossible to play using keyboard and mouse. You'll definitely need some kind of controller. I just used a cheap USB one, which worked absolutely fine. The buttons are user-definable.The game does get a bit samey after a while - it's essentially the same game 20 hours in as it is 20 minutes in. However, at the price that's not a huge problem.I enjoyed playing this. If you like arcadey football games, or are bored of FIFA and want something different, then this is well worth a look.			"

												The game is nice and the gamplay is also very amusing.I dont know for other people but i dont not prefer online games and since i played other titels of NSS did this game dissapoint me for the basic reason it was online and i was in a Club with other people i actually knew from my actually City - this is not something i liked.I would reather see the game be developed on the old basis with fake player names and therefore would be more focus on other aspects of the game like sposor nogatations as A LAGER repertuar of things you can by.Oh and by the way the puzzle in-game that define all of your Relationships in the game are REALLY pointless.

												Firstly it's not remotely worth the price tag, but on a big sale it might be worth it. It can be a fun little time waster. If you ever played Kick Off or Sensible Soccer when you were younger then you'll love this. It's a game where you play as a player, not as the team, or manager. You have to train yourself to make yourself better, then try to win the approval of your boss, your teammates, your friends, and potentially a cutie girlfriend. :)			"
