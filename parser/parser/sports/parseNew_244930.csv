Early Access Review
								About five years ago, I got in a skiing accident that left me unable to ski. No, it didn't quite ' Cripple ' me, it more left me unable to ever truly put stress on my knee again. For those who ski and snowboard, you know the ability to do so is paramount to actually staying on the damn things.I found this game just today, watching funny little youtube videos, coming across a bunch of guys messing around with it. While it illicited some laughs, I was interested. ' What is this game? And why the hell has it been under my radar this whole time? '.After about a half an hour of playing it, I can say it's decent. It's free. The ragdoll physics give me a laugh or two, and the first person doing a 720 left me breathless.Thank you for giving me my hobby back, at least in this form.			"

Early Access Review
								What was a crazy fun game about screwing around on a few mountains in super-early access has turned into a F2P purchase-fest. Backers got to play one version of the game, and now that version has been subsumed by transactions and glitchy features and collision. Maybe don't impliment a cash shop until your UI is in one piece? I managed to accidentally buy 3 copies of the same pants, exhausting my early-access founder ""funbucks"" currency. Not keeping track of this game anymore, which is a shame, because it started off feeling an awful lot like a laid-back SSX with drones and a sandbox approach.			"

Early Access Review
								DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS. This game use to be good, when it first came out on early access. I even paid for the founders pack. the physics, speed, and style of this game are not there anymore. Micro transactions are the meaning of this game now. For example, i would log in when i first got it, and have 20 different styles of jackets. Now i have two, and one of those are from the founders pack. But if i spend 1699 in game credit, i get one outfit with a set of skii's. I use to spend hours on one part of the mountain, trying to see what i could acomplish on that section. Now i cant even stand playing the game for a few minutes without getting bored. This game may be good for someone looking to throw money at a company. But someone who has been following the game since the beginning, just like many others sadly might want to do too, i have to give it a 1/10. As for now, this game will just be one of many i scroll past looking for a game to put time into, and not money.			"

Early Access Review
								I got this game after binge watching snowboarding films ( Its January and no hills in Scotland have any snow, I need my fix... ) and deciding to check steam for SSX, NO SSX on steam but it does have this early access game. To say the least I was intrigued. Before I go any further theres a couple of questions you will need to ask yourselfDo you love snowsports? Did you love SSX 3 and SSX  ( the newer 1 )? with its freeroamy goodnessDo you want to experience what pulling a 1080 feels like in first person? Can you afford to go snowboarding in other countries? ( I can't :( IF you answered yes to any of the first 3 questions and no to the last one then this game is for you. IF you answered yes to the last question then what are you doing on your PC? book that holiday to Tignes, Mayrhofen or where ever and do it for real. Read on for a more descript review Still reading? Good now lets break this downGraphics - The graphics are great, I mean its a freeskiing/snowboarding game so theres no explosions or anything fancy just fantastic looking mountains and pistes. The snows nice with persistent trails from your previous runs and the characters look well textured which is just as well cause you need to show off that fancy piece of kit you just plowed your hard earned credits into. Gameplay - The game is split into offline and online and in either of them you can choose to do events or freeroam. The events cover pretty much every category of skiing and snowboarding with time trial, freestyle etc... and the freeroam... well lets just say your plonked onto whichever part of the mountain you want and you go from there. At the time of review there is 1 mountain and several big air parks, don't let that put you off, the Mountain is huge ( of course it is, its a mountain ) The skiing itself seems fine but can be a little funny at times with some quirky bugs. I started a run and my character was stuck in the Jesus pose until I respawned or the fact that if you crash your body ragdolises as if you were made out of rubber.  I need to mention as well this game plays like a simulation so theres no insane tricks that make your ski's pop off and fly around your head before magically reattaching..... looking at you SSXMusic - The music is good, it could be better with some extra tunes and maybe some from that previous SSX game but the music they do have is chosen well for the snowscene. It would be good to see the total tracks or be able to skip them as a couple of times during freeroam its played the first track and then stopped. If anyone has been on a mountain without any music they know what thats like. Theres always steam music tho i suppose  Customization - The customization in this game is snow joke ( I had to ) This is where the game really shines, at the time of this review I am eagerly awaiting the release of the snowboarding part of the game however from looking through the items just for skiing theres is a HUGE amount to pick from. You kit your character out from head to toe literally, Chose hats,helmets,goggles,jackets,trousers,boots,skis,poles face masks & even bindings. Each of these categories have recent kit from most of the popular brands such as K2, Scott & Head to name just a few.Multiplayer - I actually haven't played much of multiplayer, my first attempt was met with huge lag. Second attempt and I saw 1 other person on the mountain which i followed in the hopes of showing my mad skills to. got ahead of him and prepared to hit a kicker unfortuntately I ended up hitting him and we both bailed. Which would of been fine but for some reason in multiplayer you can only restart at the top of the mountain and not where you bailed. Needless to say he bailed from the game. The developers are aware of the connection issues and are trying to improve it so hopefully it will be sorted soon as this is an integral part of the game, Imagine you and a couple of buddies on the side of the hill with a kicker taking turns at hitting it. For me that sounds perfectTo sum things up this game has huge potential, they are adding in snowboarding soon and If they add in the same amount of gear for snowboarding as they have for skiing I will be a very very happy person. As with any early access game theres still a long way to go. However again I highly recommend this game for any fan of snowsports or the SSX games.Some things i would like to see in the released game.Ability to get off skis/board and wander around + the ability to spawn in objects & move them ( such as ramps, tables etc ) for limited amounts of time to make your own jibs etc kinda like what SKATE hadIf you use a chair lift can we maybe be able to sit and watch from it as we go back up ( with the ability to skip ) sounds boring but its actually quite entertaining seeing whats going on from them especially when people bail :pSnowmobiles, currently used much like the chair lifts when you interact they take you to certain spawns instead maybe when we use them we could actually drive them to where ever. Would open the game up alot more.Weather and snow conditions - Everyone loves a bluebird day however in Scotland getting a bluebird day is a rare thing and i presume its the same for places everywhere else? Stoked had a fantastic weather system with storms that altered the snow conditions. It would be great to see the same thing done here Mountains - More mountains... can never have enough mountains			"

Early Access Review
								I can't believe how many bad reviews this game got. It's ridiculous. Espescially seeing all the complaints about things like speed and physics when in reality this game has WAY more realistic speed and physics than any other snow games out there like SSX Shaun White Snowboarding etc. All those games have horrible physics and DO NOT replicate real life snow sports what so ever. The funny thing is I have snowboarded all my life and didn't even care much for skiing, so I was dissappointed that snowboarding isn't in the game yet, but I went ahead and purchased anyways because I couldn't wait any longer since there are no other games out there like this one. Long story short this game actually made me like skiing for the first time ever in the 18 years of my life of being a snowboarder. I've also been waiting for a game like this forever literally. NO COMPANY has ever made a snow sports game so realistic. I needed a game like this so badly and it's finally here. So here's my review:Pros:- Very realistic physics. (Speed going uphill is a little bit off when tucking since you barely slow down but is not a problem because it allows you to find more lines. Going downhill is perfect. Please do not change it devs, do not listen to idiots.)- All tricks are realistic as well. (You can finally cork your spins. Never have I ever played a snow game that I could actually pull a double cork 10 that looks exactly like it's done in real life. In Shaun White Snowboarding the closest thing to a cork is a rodeo...no corking was implemented in that game... like wtf.)- Real life brand clothing and gear replicas. (Armada, Head, etc.)- Real life event replicas. (Nine Knights, Jon Olsson Invitational, etc.)- Real Life sponsers. (Red Bull, Monster, etc.)- Vast mountains to explore, and I mean it. The current mountain Sialia actually takes about 10 minutes real life time to get from top to the bottom at full speed making it very realistic. Also this mountain is ski - able in all directions, North, East, West, and South. Each direction has different types of terrain, including a terrain park, my favorite, that takes about 4 minutes to get down. -Lots of cool different lines you can take. The whole mountain has lines hidden away for you to find. Above I mentioned the terrain park which has multiple different directions you can take that lead you into different parts of the terrain park and back into the same parts if you wish. The choice is yours as there are so many variations to this terrain park it's truly endless fun.-Legit first person view (It literally looks like real life in first person view when you're corking a spin.)-Free 2 play coming soon. (People complaining about microtransactions yet the whole base game is free. The only thing you get if you buy into the microtransations is cosmetics and vanity. You don't gain any advantages to your character in terms of speed, power, or skills. NO PAY2WIN here. The skill is in the players hands.-Devs are super friendly and helpful and respond very fast to any problems or bug reports. (I submitted a bug report and got a response within the first day and then I responded again because I didn't give accurate information and they responded within minutes.) Most importantly they actually listen to their community.Cons:-Few bugs. (Sometimes your character bails even though he landed perfectly, which happens very rarely like 2 times in a 4 hour session. Not a big deal) (Skiing switch in first person is a little buggy since the shoulder gets in the way when tucking. Not a big deal.) Sometimes when you spawn on a drop point you get stuck until you respawn again. (Not a big deal.) (Games crashes in multiplayer sometimes as well as desyncs, which kind of pisses me off but I sent in a ticket and  devs noted these crashes and are working on fixing them, also new servers are coming very soon.)-Price of gear is just a little bit expensive but I have no problems with this at all since there is no advantage to owning this stuff. The game is free on January 27th and I will buy some just to support the devs. Obviously they can't just work for free.-Not enough advertising. I really want to see this game succeed but I only heard about this in December, yet it's appearently been out for 3 years now. I had to search deep to find this it was literally like digging for gold and hitting the jackpot. I was stuck with all these other ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games for 3 years when I could have been playing this.Summary:If you are like me and are looking for a snow sports game that actually replicates real life skiing and snowboarding, then this is the game you're looking for. This is the game you have been waiting your whole life to play, but couldn't because it was buried in a search engine full of bullsh*t. Do yourself the favour and don't waste cash on all these mainstream AAA garbage games made in China. You'll just come right back here realizing how much of an idiot you were to even bother looking at them.Hope you guys find my review useful. Thanks. "

This game should not become free to play if it means making the users pay just to switch ski's in game, just release the game as $15 and give us all the feature. thumbs up if they fix the merchendise tho			"

Early Access Review
								Update: The game now has sound and effects like ski trails etc. The controls are rough and movement still need balancing though.Definitely has the best feel of a modern snow game. The game is in alpha, there is no sound, yet I still enjoyed every second skiing down the mountain. If you like skiing you will love this even in its unfinished state. It can only go up from here.Edit: So I'm going to add a little more to this review because apparently people are actually reading it.Here's what you can complain about: Lack of sound and snow effects. Sound's no big deal, just play some of your own music in the background for now. It's the effects that really throw everything off. Your character is basically just on the mountain, as of right now there's no interaction between the skis and the mountain; no tracks, no little specks of snow going everywhere as you might expect from skis in snow. But I'm sure that's in the works, and honestly once the sound and those little effcts are in the game is more than recommendable if you enjoy the winter sports. There's a little bit of a learning curve but I'd venture a guess and say it's easier to learn to play this game than actually ski.Earlier today they put out a big update and really cleaned up a lot of the UI. The menu isn't all over the place and flicking out of view and they have the basic framework down for the multiplayer. It's looks really promising.Now of course there's bugs here and there, the previous update completely broke the options menu but I have yet to encounter any crashing while actually playing the game itself which is something.As I'm writing this there are no negative reviews so that should tell you that yes, if you're unsure whether or not  to buy it and it seems interesting, but you're afraid it won't turn out great down the road; I'd recommend it even in it's current state.

								If this were a month ago, I'd give it a thumbs up. Now? No. The latest update - the ""Beta"" update on March 10th completely changed the game from something good with lots of potential to.. something that feels less like a game and more like a cash grab. They've added microtransactions for any sort of cosmetic item. Anything that one could originally use on their character for free in the Alpha has been put behind a paywall. As of now, you can only get these items through purchasing a ""credit pack"" and getting them that way.The developer says that they will eventually add ways to earn these items in the game, but to release a major ""update"" with the microtransactions in-game for people like myself who already spent money on said game is a red flag. I know that the developers need to make a living and game development isn't cheap. On their forums, a developer has said that it was economically unwise for them to charge $15 or so for the base game and have everyone unlock the gear from the start - thus the microtransactions. However, I fail to see why exactly this business model has been adapted - it would have been much easier to just increase the price of the game accordingly - instead of adding a microtransaction system.Again, I realize that the developers need to make a profit. That's fine - but the current business model is not the best way to go, and if a drastic, negative change took place from Alpha to Beta, it makes me skeptical about what the future holds. Only time will tell. However, as of now, the game does not appear to be something worth investing in.			"

								As a skier, this game is a dream come true. I didn't want to pay 60$ for Steep, so I got this instead. Lo and behold, its an amazing game! I definantly recommend this game to anyone who likes exploration.PROS:-Really good controls, if you have a controller -Hilariously fun, especially when your dead body flails in the air after you hit a tree at 50 MPH-A HUGE open world, which has lots of secrets and cool little easter eggs to find-Just skiing around feels exciting-Tricks are so fun to pull off and try and land-The challenges and events are fun to do when exploring the mountain gets boring. (Which doesn't happen a lot)-Music is great, and sounds like what skiers listen to.-Many other things you just need to play and see!-Its FREE!CONS:-Keyboard and mouse controls are eh-The soundtrack, while great, only has about 10 songs that get repetitive-All of the cool customization is pretty much pay wall locked, but its a free game so-My biggest gripe with the game is that the mountain feels lifeless. The lack of NPC's makes the mountain feel depressing. I wish there were skiers you would have to avoid and ski past, it would add life to the game. Adding individual trail names would add a sense of realism as well. Real ski mountains have things like that that would just add life to the game.-There is some clipping with objects that is a little annoying-Some animations, such as grinding, just look dumb at the moment "

								Snow has good graphics and also good multiplayer. Snow is also fun to play and if you are a person who likes skiing or snowboarding, I would recommend you try this game your self. One thing I strongly recommend is you use a controller to make it easier to play. There are a few bugs and glitches they need to iron out yet but there not that annoying. Accessories cost credits. In order to get credits, you can level up to earn them or buy them for cheap prices with money. You can either snowboard or ski and also drive a snowmobile. You can spawn on top of a mountain and try to make your way down. You can go to parks and pull off your tricks.  I recommend trying this game out :).			"

								As much as I'd like to reccomend this game to others.... I can't really understand how a game went from ""ok"" to ""bad"" game with the updates. I bought the game as launch and remember having fun playing it. But now the game constantly crashes for me, they added micro-transactions and they made the movements worse than what they were in the beggining... I also have to add that the biggest part of the fun (with the launch version) was to explore the mountain with the ""cheating mode"" that was a mode you activated while pressing F1 and could drop your character anywhere you wanted on the mountain. Well... they took this mode out.... Will play again when the game is going to be fun and playable but for now it's getting worse and worse with every updates			"

								It's a really fun and calming game, but there a pretty fair amount of glitches. The most frustrating ones (in my opinion, of course) being landing but your snowboard or skis get stuck in the snow then you just die, and just not being able to land jumps even though you should be able too. These are frustrating but in the end it's ok. Overall, I think it's a fun way to pass the time but it might get boring once in a while. 8/10			"

								I've been playing this game for almost a total of 260 hours now and still have only found one bad thing. The game overall is smooth, has amazing gameplay, and is easily enjoyed by anyone and especially enjoyed by people who ski or snowboard in real life. The only problem I have is the glitch that starts in around 250 hours which doesnt let me play as much because it closes the game randomly. I would reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys skiing and snowboarding and likes winter sports.			"

Early Access Review
								I honestly don't understand the praise this game recieves from the top reviewers. So many people talking about how polished and smooth the gameplay is and just how great it is. I mean, the game definitely has some good aspects. The graphics are beautiful, the maps are huge and filled with things to do and explore, and there are a lot of cutomization options, challenges and events. From the outside, it does seem like a great game. The more I play it, though, the less fun I have and the more frustrated I get between grinding seemingly endlessly for credits and failing again and again on seemlingly impossible events, often due to physics issues and glitches.  The Grind The average cost for cutomization options is roughly 150 credits, with some ranging from 30's (mainly goggles) up to 1000 (mainly snow mobiles.) The main method of earning credits is every 5th level, where you will recieve 25 credits. The problem here is both only getting 25 credits every 5 levels, and the leveling frequency diminishes due to increased experience requirements as you level. You quickly end up having to grind for hours just to get 25 credits that isn't enough to actually afford anything on its own. In the 9 hours I have on this game, I have been able to afford a mask and a jacket.  The cheapest snowmobile is ~400 credits. 25 credits goes into 400 16 times and you need 5 levels to get 25 credits. 5 x 16 is 80, meaning you would need to reach level 80 to afford the cheapest snowmobile. Most snowboards and other options, as mentioned, average at about 150 credits meaning you could, at level 80, either buy a snowmobile or ~3 other average price items.  The Bugs I will admit, there aren't a lot of bugs in this game. There are, however, a small few bugs that happen very frequently and are very infuriating. During events you will crash or need to restart and do so very often. Roughly half of the time you restart an event and try to rush past the 3 second count down to get on with the event your character will end up facing the wrong way and in your attempt to get moving you will end up walking or pushing yourself the opposite direction which is especially irritating in time trials. Another big one is, for some odd reason, sometimes when you land in the snow your snowboard/skis will be stuck underneath the snow and cause you to instantly die. This also happens frequently when you try to respawn or join a friend and you end up instantly dead and, in free mode and certain events,  costs you points/exp. I've had times where I crash consecutively up to 5 times before I'm able to keep going.Over half of the events in this game rely on your score, obtained by doing tricks. Scoring high is very difficult when a lot of your score relies on perfect landings that are nearly impossible to land and often don't even register. Half of the time I do a backflip it counts as a frontflip. Tricks don't seem to register an annoying amount of the time and even when you get a high score you'll likely end up losing a lot of it due to glitches and the shoddy physics. The Constant Connection Requirement You have to be connected to the internet to even get to the main menu of this game. This wouldn't be HORRIBLE if you always had a stable connection to the servers. Unfortunately, that's nothing but a dream with SNOW as there are constant connection issues, even while doing singleplayer events. Everytime you restart or finish an event, it needs to check in with the servers which can take up to a couple of minutes sometimes which is even worse when you're constantly restarting events. I've had the game straight up freeze when it tries to connect leaving me to force close it after a few minutes of waiting. The servers are also frequently laggy and crash on occasion. Conclusion SNOW can be fun. It's definitely fun to play with a few friends and explore the large and detailed map as well as share laughs with some of the bugs and bull♥♥♥♥♥♥fun you experience while flying down a mountain at 60 MPH. Unfortunately, that's all that this game really has to offer. Outside of that is a bunch of events that won't be completed by most of you due to the difficulty, infuriating bugs, rampant connection issues,and an insane amount of grinding to be able to afford even the cheapest customization options. I can recommend this game if you want to have a couple hours of fun with friends but as soon as you start trying to take this game seriously and wanting to complete events, challenges, and progress to further your character you quickly start to realize how unfair and annoying this game is to play.

								Wow, just played today. (5/23/15)  Boy they really downgraded the game from what it originally was, terrible physics now and just awful pay wall.  I love how I paid for a game that decided half way through to change to F2P and ruin their system.  This game is failed in every way it can to its supporters.I use to own everything in the shop, it was supposed to be a game you had to buy, now it's just an utter shell of itself and to make matters better they decide to either ditch the last physics system they had or edit it to the point of a terrible arcade-e little♥♥♥♥♥♥of physics.My last investment in a game where I don't have a say in the way it's shaped.  The developers can burn for all I care.Don't pay for early access, just wait to uninstall it for free "

								Bought this game in early alpha and followed through the developement.I am extremely disappointed in the developers.This game had great potential and the idea aswell as parts of the current game are so fun and inspired.The flipside is gigantic tho. The development has basically stood still for over 2 years. Snowboarding was promised to be finished 1.5 years ago. Sales went great. Less and less effort went into the game. Now that Snowboarding is out it is a buggy mess. After 2 Years. The very little time they invested completely went into milking the financial potential. For an unfinished game with almost all core problems unfixed the prices for micropayments are absolutely beyond ridiculous. I payed 13 bucks to support this game. I used to be able to use all cosmetics. For free. Now i would have to pay roughly 3500$ for that. In a completely unfinished Beta game that will 99.999% never be finished. Im so sincerely disappointed in Poppermost for taking this game in the completely wrong direction. You guys seemed like genuine people but I guess I was wrong. Or the good sales ""changed your minds"".Well, whatever you do, do not get this game, do not support these developers. Core elements still dont work, riding and doing tricks feels awkward if anything and not fun in any way. Stay away!			"

								Great physics, beautiful graphics, and completely open-world. The controls really give you full manueverability of your character and allow you to be in conrtol 100% of the time, even mid-trick. The challenges are fun and give you points to spend at the store where you can customise the look of your character. There is a leveling system which gives you various unlocks as you progress, providing new content to sink your skiis into. Online multiplayer does exist, but with a 12 player limit, good luck getting into one. Highly recommended.Edit: The player count has died down a bit, and the servers are easier to access.			"

								[Recently announced changes promise to remove my largest issue with SNOW (grinding to unlock spawns). I'll update this review once I've had a chance to try it out. Until then, take this with a pinch of salt]I do recommend this game, but it's a grudging recommendation...The good:* The scenery is stunning* Going off-piste is fantastic* It has bags of potential* Pretty damned good simulation (especially since the latest update, still a few glitches but generally OK)* Excellent music* Great fun to relax and unwind with (I prefer free roam to doing events)* Lots of features being added / improved* Dev team seem committed and I see no signs of vapourware* I haven't personally had any performance issues (although I've seen post from some who have)* Rift support!The bad:* Microtransactions (At least they're currently cosmetic only)* If you want to get to the good spawn points, you have to grind XP* Features keep being removed* Updates are a little slow and there's no target 1.0 date* Controls could do with a tweak (especially moving the camera in 3rd person)* Grinding XP (worth mentioning again, especially when wiping out costs unbanked XP)Perhaps I was spoiled by playing very early versions of this game, but I loved if because it left me alone on a mountain to explore and go where I wanted. Now, however, if you want to try the best bits of the mountain, you need to grind XP which is still insanely slow in Free Roam mode.I may be wrong but I get the impression that once the game is Free2Play, the devs are worried people won't hang around long enough to spend money. Unfortunately, it's turned a fun, relaxing game into yet another slog.I do still recommend it, just. It's beautiful and worth playing, but IMHO it's worse overall than it used to be.			"

								Ok so .. there has been a recent influx of negetive reviewers. Most of the negetivity is due to either:1. They found out they have to pay real money to customize their skiers looks2. The latest update has a few glitches that need to be ironed out.However, consider that:A. The game will EVENTUALLY be free to play, and they will fund the game on in game purchases. It currently is not because the game is still in early access. You are paying extra money to access the game early .. NOT TO BUY THE GAME. You might think that is stingey, but this is an independantly developed game by a company with LIMITED RESOURCES .. they need your money to make the game!B. Early Access = glitches .. welcome to the world of modern game development.If you can get past those 2 points and have more patience than a 5 year old whiner, then this game is the BEST Skiing game ever made, and IMO the BEST Winter sports game ever made.The major selling point is that the game takes a more grounded ""less arcadey"" approach, while the physics are still a little loose to allow you to pull off some silly jumps, it mostly gets there and it does it well. You can explore a full mountain with little to no restrictions, which includes a resort complete with lifts (which will be rideable eventually) and an entire back country area. There are a plethora of ways down the mountain, and nothing limits you in any direction.This is the Skiing game I have been wishing for since I was 5, and I fully recommend it.			"

Early Access Review
First off, SNOW is a game that I wish I could mark as ""neutral"". Since Steam doesn't allow that recommendation, I ultimately went with a ""yes"".With a vast glistening landscape and much land to explore, it's hard not to appreciate the beauty that is SNOW. Make your way through the powdery bliss while taking in the various sights and wonderful wilderness. Like the wise Eminem once said, ""lose yourself in the moment"".---------------------------------------------------------GameplayIf you ever had the joy of owning a GameCube, and played SSX Tricky for that matter, then you'll feel relatively at home with this PC translation. If not, then you're still in for a decent treat. While the game has some Early Access issues, ranging from severe graphical glitches to a terribly unforgiving ""death"" system, this game still has its delights that make me recommend it overall.Within this game, you are able to explore a fictitious mountainside named Sialia. There are a number of things that you can do, such as free roaming sessions, and Olympic imitation half pipe performances and ramp jumps. Truly, SNOW offers a fairly realistic winter sports package.Of course, as stated previously, this game has some irritating issues. First off, the punishment for hitting a rock is reasonable. It's death and a restart. Fair enough, yes? Well, then comes the plastic fence. Did you accidently - lightly - graze it? Too bad. Here's your gravestone and a restart. Happen to land on a small twig? Death and a restart. Want to test the fluffiness of that snow bank? Well... yeah, you get the picture. If you're not precise and exact with your movements and control (in other words, a pro), expect to restart this gae a hell of a lot of times.GraphicsSimply put, the graphic in SNOW is absolutely stunning and breathtaking. There is no denying it. Never have I ever been so impressed with a snowboarding/skiing game, and never have I seen one so realistic. The day and night cycle is definitely a huge plus as well, as it further enhances the immersion effect.There is one small gripe that I have, however, and that is the quality of gameplay that you can achieve with a low end PC. My Toshiba E45T is considered one of these said machines, and it makes the game somewhat difficult to play, While I can still enjoy the beauty of the game, the Field of Vision (FOV) is just terrible for me. For example, by the time I see a tree, I've already ""Dittoed"" into a gravestone. This goes for other objects as well, such as the rocks and snowbanks.AudioThe 3 songs that this game has to offer is amazing. The first time I heard them I pretty much fell in love. It really compliments the title. Then I heard them again, and again, and again, and again... the same 3 songs for the next 2 hours that I ended up playing. So while the music is amazing at first, plan on listening to your own playlist... your sanity will thank you later.In regards to the atmospheric sounds, I have no complaints. The wind picking up while your speeding down a slope sounds so authentic, it's amazing. Another plus one to the immersion factor. The scratching of the board on ice is realistic as well. Everything just sounds so perfect, I really can't compliment this aspect enough.---------------------------------------------------------Pros+ Tons of challenges+ This is a great game to play with friends; easy game to get in to if you're already familiar with winter sports+ A lot of things that you can do in this game: ""Fochi 2014"" (play on Sochi 2014), half pipe parks, and free roam+ There aren't a lot of decent snowboarding/skiing games out there, and this one brings me back to my SSX Tricky days+ Honestly, you can't beat the fact that this game is free; does have microtransaction, but it's an amazing product overall+ The graphics are just wonderful - of course it has its issues, but hopefully they're all taken care of by the time this game leaves Early AccessNeutral± There is controller support but it doesn't really feel complete... I could just suck at this game, though... I wouldn't put it past me± If you like electronica music, then the soundtracks in this game will attract you. However, you'll fast become annoyed with them due to there only being 3 so far± It takes some time to connect to the server, but I can't completely blame the game. There are plenty of people who have noted the server issues though, such as losing/dropping connection, but I can say this with 100% truth: I have yet to be kicked from the servers± Decent enough to play on a low end machine, but you will experience some issues. Also, for some reason my friend, who has a better rig than I do, is unable to play this game (it crashes all the time on him). Maybe there is an issue with various graphic cards? Expect some issues in this department (or maybe it's the server issues)Cons- Why am I stuck with a bald headed man?- Weird physics at times: you mean to go one way but end up twirling the other- How do you gain big air? I see it happening in the video, but I can't achieve it in any way whatsoever... please teach me your secrets- I got stuck between a snow bank and a cabin roof. This only happened once, but it was still pretty annoying have to load up the game again- Currently way too easy to die/fail when performing tricks; sometimes you die for absolutely no reason (I remember spawning and dying immediately. What gives?)- While you're able to customise your character, the grind is honestly too real. In the time that I have played this game, I have yet to gain any kind of coin. I'm not really interested in customising my character, however, but I can see where people will have issues with this---------------------------------------------------------Last RemarksMy first impression of this game has been decent. I was not here from the very beginning so I can't compare it to then (supposedly it was even better than it is now). Is that true? I will never know. The best I can offer you is the experience that I had and, while it's probably not popular opinion, it is my own.I'm already biased due to the fact that I never really found a good snowboarding game after my GameCube days. Despite its laundry list of issues, SNOW ended up being the jump back into time that I needed. Furthermore, I really do appreciate all that this free to play game has to offer. From its gorgeous graphics to the size of the map, I personally find it rather difficult to completely dislike this title.Like I said, hopefully the issues can be worked out. This game has been out for a long time now - since October 2013 - so I have hopes for it. If you're into winter sport's, then I'd say SNOW is a decent contender in this overall lacking genre on Steam.Overall5.5/10---------------------------------------------------------Like my review or have any questions? Then please consider joining my review group, the Sonny Report! I will keep it up to date with the games that I plan on reviewing and will also accept suggestions.If you would like to see how SNOW performed on my laptop, you can check out some footage here:

Fold cream into chocolate mixture and then egg whites in two batches.3. Divide mousse among serving dishes; refrigerate for 3 hours or overnight.4. To make chocolate curls, melt remaining chocolate and spread evenly over a cold surface such as a flat oven tray, or laminated benchtop. Leave to set almost to room temperature.

Early Access Review
								This could've been awesome: open world, free to play, finally added snowboards... Sadly it's not. Maybe it's better if you use skis, since that seems like what this was originally designed for, but I'm a snowboarder for real, so I'm not really interested in using skis.So as far as snowboards go, here's my list of complaints:- Controls are okay at best, I do like the button to carve hard and slow down, but otherwise it seems harder to go where        you're trying to than it should be.- Pretty much impossible to mess up jumps unless you land on your head. You can land sideways and not fall, you just lose all your momentum and have to ride extremely slowly for possibly a long time before you reach another sharp descent. I'd rather just fall.- Grinds are ridiculously difficult to do: Angle off by like 2°? Missed the rail. Jumped at the ramp leading to it? Flew right over the whole thing. Didn't jump? Crashed into it instead. - If you do manage to get on a rail, all you can do is boardslide and spin, no nose or tail presses, not even 50-50s.  So not only is it easier to grind rails for real, but I can do a lot more variations. That shouldn't be the case.- Also no manuals.- Really annoying bug where you fall for no reason at the start of a course, and you can get locked into a loop of restart to immediate fall that goes on seemingly forever.- No option for customizing your rider, only clothes and gear. Don't want to be a white, blond, male with a buzzcut? Too bad, that's all you've got to work with.- Pretty sure there's a total of 2 songs on the soundtrack.I really wanted to like this game... I haven't been able to get to a mountain for a couple winters now, and I was really hoping this could at least sorta make me feel better, but all it did was frustrate me and put me in a bad mood.

Graphics: 7/10Okay, the graphics are not super, but they're still pretty good and I think that's good enough for this game, if you zoom on buildings etc... You'll see they're not very detailed, but that's ok.Musics and Sound: 7.5/10They're only a few musics, but they're nice overall, for the sounds, they're all pretty nice except that snow sound which is louder than music and extremely annoyingGameplay: 5/10Well, there's a lot to say about gameplay, first of all, it's nice to have a FREE snowboard/ski game. With all the maps, challenges and events aswell as achievements, the lifetime of SNOW is sure good BUT there are A LOT of bugs, gamebreaking or not, here's a list of bugs I encountered:In the event ""The Devil's Descent"", when you spawn there's stone walls on the left, but they don't have hitboxes so you can go trough them and skip a small part of the descentWith the drone, if you rush in stones while boosting and going up, down etc... You can go trough the stonesThe most horrible bug, sometimes, with NO reason, your player keep crashing when he spawn, again and again, even restarting the game don't change the problem, idk how to correct it...In the event ""S Games Big Air"" my game keeps crashing and I have to log out of Windows or restart my computer.A funny bug, whenever you crash, your character fly meters away, go in the sky while you still hear the skiing sound or do some giant slides.Ok, now for the credits, the only things they can buy that is a feature is the snowmobile which you should be able to get if you keep the credits you win, otherwise you can buy cosmetics for your snowboards/ski, your clothes etc... I think it's a good way for the dev team to make some money aswell as keeping the game totally F2P except for the snowmobileOverall: 6.5/10The game has a great potential, but it has a load of gamebreaking bugs which are never fixed, and it's very probably going to be crushed by Steeps. The game isn't that bad and you can get cosmetics and unlock features if you play enough, the 1st person mode is probably nice in VR.			"

								As I am not fortunate enough to go skiing every year, I play this game to have some nostalgia.And well, it does a good job. This game is very calming, it runs well and it's free!I would recommend using a controller to play, but it is not 100% necessary.It has it's fair share of glitches but i'm willing to see these through as the developers work on this game.Thanks devs for making me an emotional wreck otherwise.9/10 game.

								Because snowboarding in the DMV area sucks, I SNOW ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. The Pros: - Masive creative lines - Massive gear & updates- Massive jumps and boxes- Online multiplayer with friendsThe Cons:- Grinding rails is a bit difficult (but so is real life) - The soundtrack easily becomes a bit to repetitive - Players can spawn on/off you in multiplayer during a trick combo "

								Pros and Cons below but keep in mind this is an early access title.Pros:-Great Locations (Only 3 at the moment)-Nice Visuals-Good Amount of tricks.-Solid Mechanics-Steady developer updates-Nice customization optionsCons:-Awkward animations when landing at times (landing when you should fall)-No points or specified tricks when grinding ledges/rails-Some glitches like hats/clothing disappearing and the game freezes at times. (alpha status)-No audio options at the moment, so no muting or changing volume levels. (minor complaint)Overall I really like where this game is headed. I just hope they don't abandon the game before its complete. There is only skiing at the moment but I heard snowboarding will be added so I'm looking forward to that. If you enjoy skiing and/or winter sports this should be a good game for you. I'v played almost 6 hours already and I don't see myself stopping anytime soon. Its a nice change of pace from other games. My gameplay if you're interested>>>>>>>>>>

								(TL;DR) Good gameThroughout my small playtime of SNOW I have greatly enjoyed it, and can see that this game has a lot of potential. The other reviewers seem to be angered by the microtransactions, however, these transactions are only cosmetic for the players character model/skier. So no, there are no BS microtransactions that give another player benefits over others. I'm going to keep this review short and sweet/explainable as possible.PROS: -Beautiful graphics-Decently optimized / Runs GREAT on higher end PCs-Open World-Lots of details and things to look at-Fun Gameplay-Good physics (Sometimes glitch out and act weird)-GREAT atmosphere-Good soundtrack-Navigation is easyCONS: (DunDunDun)-Multiplayer is lacking, while it's there it just seems thrown in at the moment-Wacky Ragdolls (This can be a con because of how hilariously your player model flails about the mountains/slopes.)-Small amount of maps at its current state-Grinding doesn't seem to work wellAll in all, SNOW is a great game at it's core. However, could be improved.Hopefully they add the ability to remove your skiis, and add more activities to do on the mountains. (Snow related.)My final verdict-8/10 at its current state :) "

								RATING: 8.7/10 - ExcellentSUMMARYSnow is an excellent skiing game, and is really impressive consideringit being in early stages of development. Recommended for anyone looking fora quality skiing experience on PC.FULL REVIEWSNOW boots you to the main menu where you'll find freestyle skiing, and a store to customize your character. You also find some upcoming features, like Competitive Events. The store is filled with lots of good looking gear, and hopefully much more will come. When you hit Freestyle, you are able to select from a Mountain, the Tutorial, and an olympic themed course. The tutorial I found to be quite confusing, but most of the game is quite simple once you get the basic controls. The mountain is beautifully designed, with great views and jump points. It also has hidden easter eggs like the Yeti and Castle. The olympic course looks pretty good, and can be alot of fun to pull off tricks. Speaking of tricks, air stunts in this game flow well, and there are a great number of them. One problem with this game is sound has yet to be an implemented feature. I'd also like to mention the console's cheat commands, allowing you to slow gravity can be very fun. In conclusion, I recommend this game to anyone looking for a good skiing game on steam.			"

Early Access Review
								SNOW is a fantastic blend of realism, fluid controls, fun and great gameplay. There have been many ski/snowboard games beofre now but all fell short in some ways. For one, many lacked gorgeous graphics and controls were often stiff and/or cumbersome. Secondly, no other ski/snowbaord game that I have encountered has sufficiently embraced free roam as a major part of the game. SNOW is very open and the urge to explore an immense map put before you is alaways prevalent, unlocking new and diverse areas along the way. The two things I see as cons are microtransactions being too preavlent and unstable UI, but these aspects can easily be overlooked with vast custimization options and unique features throughout. I thouroughly enjoy SNOW and will contue to enjoy its relaxing and great gameplay to its fullest extent.			"

								For an alpha game especially, this game is more fluid than just about any other winter sport sim I have personally played. For the price its worth investing in this gem - the game is worth the money now in alpha, just imagine when it hits release.Right now there are only 3 different ""parks"" or mountains or whatever. Additional maps are inevitable and the ones they have now seem to be very well thought out as far as possible lines and different variaions of ways you can go down the mountain. 10/10 would ski again - and I'm a boarder.Also - I heard whispers of snowboarding being added to this game at some point? Just rumors...? or is this real life,,,,			"

Now since the update there are so many more complicated buttons and I can't even gain any speed when I have to spam w and then hold left shift for tucking, turning, and a bunch of other things. It just kinda ruined the fast paced casual skiing fun and replaced it with some complicated too realistic simulator.			"

								SNOW is an upcoming free to play open world skiing game that allows you to ski the mountain down whatever line you wish. You can change the way your character looks and reshape the mountain to your every wish. Scroll to the bottom if you just want to read the general review :) Time for the review:Graphics:This is an early access game, remember that. This game still has amazing graphics and lighting in every aspect. The game graphics are amazing. The low graphics settings ups the performance a lot but still looks very nice, and dont even get me started on how great the ""very high"" setting looks.Controls:The controls are pretty straight forward, just takes a look at the player guide to figure everything out, but becomes very simple after you get the hang of it.Gameplay:The game runs out really smoothly, with glitches here and there, but just remember to keep in mind that this is in PRE-ALPHA state, meaning that the game's core mechanics and gameplay are still in development. The game still has very realistic physics and skiing experience.Performance:SNOW has very good perormance most of the time. The only problem you might have is that when you load a mountain when you are on a different one the game occasionally crashes (at least for me).Sound:Yes, it has been added. a lot of the other reviews are a little outdated. The sound is SO realistic for an early-access game. It sounds just like it would on the mountain.Game Size:This game a healthy amount of varied features that help counter-balance the glitches in this gameMultiplayer:SNOW has a multiplayer feature but you usually end up in lobbies with little to no people inside. Once the game goes F2P then it will likely get a lot better. This is at least how it ends up for me, but maybe not for others.Mountain design:SNOW's mountains are very well made and have lots of ridable features. The features in the Lo2 park have full jumping/grinding capability, and the backcountry, like the observatory or summit have many obstacles such as boulders and rocks.OVERALL:I recommend this game to any gamers who love to play freestyle sports video games, open world games, or just love playing glitchy games for the fun of it(they'll get fixed soon, please dont fix the funny ones :3). If you don't like games that are very glitchy then i would wait until the game reaches beta. Same goes for people who dont want to pay for the game. I had a really fun time playing this and it probably wont go out of early access for a while anyways, so...................................... 9.5/10 would review again :3			"

								Moje česká preview: http://www.playhit.cz/2014/12/snow-nejrealistictejsi-simulator-lyzovani/First of all, I'm gonna say that I recommend the purchase of the Early access only to the biggest fans and those who are willing to support a project in its beginning, a project, that is not a full game yet.SNOW looks awesome! You gotta love every detail in this game's graphics. The panorama is actually so beautiful that it makes you loose your focus on riding itself! But then comes the downer side, riding feels great and all, very realistic, until you hit a rail or fall down and glitch your body half way through to the Matrix. I think there should be a button for sliding like in Tony Hawk for example, otherwise the rider looks just plain bored, standing all straight and stuff. Or, there actually is a button for this but I didn't find it because there is no way to check out or adjust the controls! That is kinda unacceptable, but I do understand this is a pre-alpha and I'm not gonna judge it so harshly until the whole thing's out. I can't wait to review this later when they put snowboards in it. I am a passionate SNB rider myself and it would be great to performe some tricks on PC that I'm scared to try IRL.I'll edit this when it's out.			"

Originally posted by Moonie:I'm not really going to rate this game on microtransactions as I always ignore the microtransactions part.Honestly, I used to be able to run this game and I thought it was actually really fun.With the new engine update, it's really ruined it for me. Runs absolutely terribly and they ruined the entire gameplay because now you have to unlock the areas, after playing it for roughly 1 hour or less trying to find out how to unlock the areas, I just couldn't. I don't know how.Through out the playthrough I've found waaay too many bugs (Understandable for a EA game) with both gameplay and controls. With the 360 (And XBone) Controller, it would either not work half way through the game (And I'd have to restart) or it would just crash the minute I used my controller. Keyboard and Mouse controls were fairly decent, didn't notice much of a problem other than a imput delay but it was ""Alright"".Here's my opinion about microtransactions, there should be a way to earn credits instead of having to buy these credits.This would really dim down the whole micro-transaction part, or maybe add a way to earn these clothings that you can buy with these creditsMy overall rating without my microtransactions review: 3/10My overall rating with my microtransactions review: 2/10When new updates are released, I'll change my review depending on the updates.The updates have rolled in and I just installed the game after not playing it for... a couple months maybe?Let's ignore microtransactions completely, because the game it's self is actually pretty fun (now atleast), I'm still using the same build since I wrote the quoted review and the performance is flawless on the max settings. (Average of 120 - 200 FPS, frames do drop below 100 for me when I'm in forest-like areas.) Now, about the whole speed loss n' such after the engine change, yeah, I'm noticing that's kinda gone, but after the latest updates, it looks like they brought it back.I'm actually in love with this, mainly the multiplayer though, it's so damn fun playing with your friends in this game, honestly. I'd say pick up this game for you and a friend it you wanted to have fun, playing solo is still fun but sorta bland.The ragdoll physics are abit wonky but are actually pretty funny, assuming that's not intentional, I hope it stays like this, I love it. Skiing physics in general, I'd say they're solid, a few ""Hard to control"" things here and there, but overall works fine.Now, I'll get onto the bad of this game. The UI really needs some tweeking and reworking, in it's current state, it works with SOME flaws, the UI in general is somewhat barely useable by mouse, but fine with keyboard and controller, hoping that this is not meant to be played with just a controller (Despite me using a controller mainly). The arrows to select between settings is rather annoying to click on the mouse, but perfectly fine for a controller.Switching settings is tedious as hell, I was trying to change my graphics settings and the screen the game was on, but the settings would either 1) change to what it was on before, 2) go back to defaults or 3) just go to some random setting I didn't select. YET AGAIN, this is another mouse & keyboard problem for me, using the controller for the settings, then applying them and they're set to what I chose, which is making me feel this game is very... ""Controller-required"" if that makes sense, mainly for the UI.As much as I said ""Let's ignore microtransactions"", I want to bring it up just this once;Yeah, sure there's microtransactions, but that doesn't mean dislike the game, all the items are cosmetic, they do not provide and sort of ""Boost"" of some kind, not saying I'll give them money for this type of system. But looking at the leveling system, it seems they give you items AKA unlocking parts of the map and the cosmetics, which I really like about a game filled with microtransactions. I will point out that you can unlock other areas of the map by skiing around or in them, which is a huge plus for unlocking areas. But this also means you are limited to certain areas for some time, getting around isn't entirely that hard though.My overall rating without my microtransactions review: 7.5/10My overall rating with my microtransactions review: 7.5/10			"

								Snow is a skiing (and later snowboarding) simulation game.I love the game soo much because of the thrill and immerssion you get from a game. It really feels like you are on a mountain with the sound of the snow and wind whipping around while you, race down a mountain at deadly speeds.The main mountain is very well crafted (except for a few ways out of the map) and is clearly shown that a lot of work was put into the landscape. The game is really beautiful with a dam, town, forest and much more.This game clearly had effort put into it and is well worth the cheap price.10/10           ps. keep up the good work, developers.

								Oh boy, the developement process... In the early stages, without any store or really anything to do except for exploring, this game was a lot of fun already and my hopes for a halfway decent skiing/snowboarding game rised. Then came the infamous ""cash shop"" update, that also changed the existing physics to something horrendous. The controls got slippery and manouvering in the game world got tedious. And, ofcourse, the prices. Coins were way to expensive for the amount of goodies you were able to get. Right now you get 1000 coins for 10$. A full set of new equipment will net you around 1,2-1,5k. That makes 15$. Don't get me wrong, that's a lot of cash for some digital clothes. Especially for an early acces game that might never be finished... On the other hand, other developers sell cosmetic goodies for up to 30$ (you know who i'm looking at here...) and people buy it. So i think supporting the only company that seems to have atleast some interest in a skiing- and later on snowboarding game, no matter how long the developement will go on, is a good thing.And let's be honest... The game, at its core, is enjoyable and fun to play. On top of that, there is some way to earn coins through playing, thought I don't know how that works exactly....			"

								There are lots of bugs. As in like all of them. sometimes you just randomly crash(only happened once to me though), sometimes you dont crash when you should, use never worked for me, and while it's not a bug, it was almost impossible to see the runs diffrent from the snow on the side. With all of that said though, it's still fun. I find myself fixated on doing soem very specific weird stuff, and it's fun to try to complete those goals. The controls aren't great, but if you switch it from being a snow sport simulator to just being a weird fun game, it works. It's very early acsess, but it's still fun. Good concept, and I can't wait to see it improve.			"

								The best winter sports sim to date!      Playing SNOW in it's Alpha form, though buggy in certain situations, lays the groundwork for a highly addicting, realstic, ski simulation game.      Each update is highly anticipated.        The latest, M4, changed many of the rotation dynamics so that they are presented more realistically.  The features in the  new L02 park are fixed to work most of the time.  Grinding and jumping from rail to rail looks incredibly smooth.  Spinning off of rails and boxes is a lot of fun.  The big airs aren't super massive to where it's unbelievable anymore, but the realistic approach works so well for this type of game.      The rest of the mountain has improved much, although, I wish there was still a castle.  Maybe there is?  Maybe I haven't found it yet?   Another great feature of this game:  replayability.  I have spent hours taking alternative routes and  hitting yet another crazy line.  The mountain is huge and every nook and cranny is worth exploring.       Overall, I believe this game is an incredible purchase $15.  With the fact that it will also be coming out for PS4, this game will make drastic improvements and additions within the next year (maybe months if we are lucky) including multiplayer, more mountains, new items, and snowboarding.  The ultimate ski sim.  I would recommend this game to anyone who is likes realstic sims or skiing/snowboarding. "

								From what I've experienced with this game people either love it or hate it.Personally, I really enjoyed this game for these reasons:- PC gamers havent had a free roam multiplayer snowboarding game ever. It's an awesome experience riding with friends.- The game isn't impossible hard, but at the same time it can be difficult to perform extremely well.- Riding with all my friends creates an experience similiar to snowbaording/skiing with friends in real life.- The game has a lot of potential to be something new- The bugs currently in the game make for a hilarious experience. They arent game breaking.A couple of things I'd like to see:- Private Servers for friends- Expanded character customization- A social menuIn conclusion, 8/10.... Too much snow			"

								Hello Mr. ""IneedtohearsomeExpierence""!Visuals:If u want to see a beautiful Winter-Mountain-Landscape and exploring these, you will need a good graficcard. Not like me nvidea 600 series :S because the time of that series is really over, but its possible to play if u have other good stuff in your PC, like me 1st series of i7.Enough about the PC, the person model it self is a little bit stiff, but otherwise it would eat more ressources, so i take that because the scape is more important!Gameplay:Awesome, first you will feel back in SSX with the keysettings on controller (if you played), but with improvements, because you can decide where you Grap your Ski's (ski only, Snowboard & Snowmobile will income). Playing with Keyboard feels rediciulous, but also possible and i used it enough to say that's ok (since yesterday 30.03.16) you are also able to make new keybindings :DGaming Modes you have are: Soloplay (with Awesome Features), Multiplayer (for the fun and showtime with friends).In the Soloplay you have Events to get first cosmetic stuff, challenges (witch i could play till yet) but its like a check list of tricks u have to do and of cause u have the freeroom where u can check out the whole mountain. The Multiplayer has No Drone, No own Respawn Point, but its for cruising with friends.So for your decision, if you like to explore Mountain's in Winter and do some Tricks, take that Simulator, because it looks like u driveing a skiing pro, never saw some compareable, exceptable is SSX for Playstation, but the difference between those two are the focuse of the Gamedeveloper, Snow is more the Simulator witch is Focused ""Ride the mountain on your Own"" and make it beautiful with nice Jumps. And on other Hand SSX is just more like Tony Hawk, Arcade highscoring.For over 10 Years i was Every Year in Austria, Skiing / Snowboarding and for me its an Awesome game for relaxing but at the same discover new areas and try Awesome Jumps from rediculous Drops.Thank you for reading my first ReviewPlz give me some Feedback,critics also welcome :D			"

 Disclaimer - I have been gifted a free key for this game for review purposes, however my review will be kept as truthful as possible, since I am meant to help developers and buyers/gamers.  SNOW Review:  (Not so) Quick summary It's one of the top of the genre, if not, the top of the Snow games genre. Excellent graphics, lots of maps which are very large, especially the Mountain which has more than 10 spawn points all in different areas, with each one having so much to explore than the others. You can be a pumkin head with epic shoes doing a backflip just to land it perfectly and - just in time - take a screenshot. The optimization might not be the best, so I just put it onto medium-ish settings. And I'm telling you that if I can run Titanfall on medium, I should be able to run this on high! Wait... look at that snow, all these textures! It's so good looking! Nevermind then, if you take a closer look SNOW is very strong in the category of Graphics.  Graphics It's a beautiful game, very impressive for a game which costs this little. You might say to yourself ""Heh, that's nothing. Have you Seen GTA V?"" and to that I said that I have seen it and played both games, SNOW and GTA V. GTA V is a costly game which is a finished release with some updates. SNOW is a cheaper game in earlier developement with way more snow. It's just very nice to see that you can change time ingame. I love to set it to sunrise. All those pinkish colors on the snow, those brighter shadows. It looks almost like a film or as if I'm an actual Skieer with a camera strapped to a flying bot following me. An easy 9/10. Sounds The sounds remind me of the Skate series. Skate is about skating, SNOW is about skiing. Both have magnificent sounds about their genres. The snow sounds realistic as if I'm cutting it up, which I sort of am in the game. The music is excellent, just, one of the best soundtracks, Burnout Paradise in front of SNOW by only a few points. The sounds are very high quality. A simple 8/10 for sounds. Payment You can pay for cosmetic items. since I have recieved the Starter Edition from the kind developers, I do not know if you start with any ingame credits.  Anyway, there's definitely quite a bit over 100 items in total that you can purchase. The average itme is around 50-70 credits. Some items cost a bit more (up to 200 from what I have seen). So you could buy a lot, trust me on this. I got an epic Pumkin Hat for very cheap. It looks awesome. You can get more credits by using real-life money. Pros vs Cons Pros:Excellent graphicsCheap for such a good gameItem pricing is low enough to buy a ton for littleUpdates are not too rareSounds are very impressiveCons:Not the best optimization  I have been gifted the key by the kind developers of the game.

Early Access Review
								This is one of the only games I've ever played where switching control schemes has improved it so drastically that I've gone back and altered my previous review.Long story short: Play this game with a gamepad. Analog sticks are absolutely essential, the M/K controls are complete sewage, but you could probably guess that.Apart from that, the game is a really fun, fast-paced, and generally intuitive skiing sim. Combos require enough skill in timing to be genuinely satisfying to pull off, the maps are absolutely gorgeous (CryEngine ain't no slouch in the visual department) and there are very few other games that so accurately recreate the feeling of flying through a forest at breakneck pace. It makes the moments of triumph all the more fun to achieve when they're punctuated by your character inevitably crashing into a tree and his ragdoll shooting into space.On that note, the game can get frustrating at times. The camera is angled slightly downward by default, and the way the maps are laid out makes it very difficult to actually see past bigger inclines. That means that if you're going for the biggest jumps (and why would you not be?) you're taking massive leaps of faith every time, and it's almost impossible to predict whether your angle is going to send you into a fluffy patch of snow for a perfect landing or into a rock so your character can make another trip into space. Meanwhile, the combo system gives out points for tricks and penalizes mistakes, but the amount it penalizes doesn't seem to have any correlation to the severity of the mistake you made. At one junction, I had just pulled off a cork 1440, earning 80 points in the process, and had landed right next to a row of trees, so I had to do a little weaving to avoid a crash. I didn't quite get out of the way of a slight incline in the ground, though, and my character tripped up on it, so I rewinded about 20 feet to turn a little harder left and avoid it, for which the game penalized me 120 points. So my net profit for one of the biggest jumps and longest combos I pulled off in the game was -40 points. I don't know how it calculates those penalties, but that formula needs an overhaul before this game finishes its Early Access run.Tokens are ridiculously hard to earn without microtransactions, but that much was predictable just from the fact that the game has microtransactions at all. Of course they're difficult to earn without paying, that's the whole point. But what bewilders me about the microtransactions is that the only things currently available in the store are a paltry handful of challenges and cosmetic bonuses, neither of which really seem enticing when the game already comes with six maps and a bunch of unlockables. Mind you, only one of the maps that comes with the base game (Sialia) is actually an open world for exploration and the rest are just challenge runs with one or two jumps in their entirety. It's not like I expected Skyrim for the asking price, but when the game sells itself as an open-world skiing experience I would like a change of scenery every now and again. I was never a fan of jump events even back when I was on a ski team in real life, and exploring giant mountains at high speed has always been my favorite part of the sport. It's not a deal-breaker, because Sialia is a pretty good map with a lot of places to explore, but I'd definitely like the game more if it had more open areas like that. Moreover, it wouldn't make the store itself feel completely vestigial.So in short, it's a little bit buggy and a little bit of a cash grab, but I can't really begrudge it because the core experience is still rock-solid as far as skiing games go. Definitely feels like an Early Access title, but it's at least got me interested enough to hold out until the full release. Make of that what you will.			"

Early Access Review
								OK so first off, i just bought this game and i have seen a few videos on it so i was pretty excited. (NOTE: I am writing this review fully knowing that this is an early access game. these are just things that I hope get fixed)First off, the video settings and all settings in general are almost impossible to change and it takes a long time to change it from ""windowed"" to ""full-screen"". That really annoyed me. Then when i tried to play it (my PC is ""supposed to be able to handle it"" according to the requirements) but the loading screen was so long it reminded me of Skyrim. Then the map didn't even load and it started changing my COMPUTER'S screen zooming in everything. I tried closing the game, but it wouldn't close. Even when i tried to crash-close it with the task manager on my computer. So after the 10 dollars I spent and the hour I waited downloading this gave me 7 minutes in hell. This game looks really good even though i am not able to play it with the ""recommended"" computer specs. I am really sad that I wasn't able to play it and i will keep trying to get it to run.One thing. I do NOT want the came changing anything on my computer and messing with the screen and my other windows and stuff because its really annoying and i have to fix it all. and it also needs to have settings that are easier to change. That is all---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------NEW REVIEW!This game has improved so much! It is less intensive on your computer, has more places to go and things to do and is just more fun than it was a while ago! Now it is one of my favorites. Definitley worth the 10 dollars it used to be!			"

Early Access Review
								One could argue it's pointless writing a review for a game that is literally half-finished, but I like to think of Early Access reviews as reviews based on potential. And the potential for SNOW is immense.While most winter sports games are about racing or chaining together ludicrous jumps, SNOW is a more level-headed approach focused on the actual riding. Not that it doesn't feature its own share of ridiculousness: Surviving a drop from 30 meters with both your legs intact is just another day at the office. And due to the game's open approach, it's up to the player whether he does alpine skiing or just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥around at the half-pipe.Despite the game being in a very early stage, it already captures the sense of freedom and speed more than adequately. It's a blast just shooting downhill and dodging obstacles or finding new routes during freeriding, all while relaxing electronica is playing in the background. SNOW treats winter sports with respect and transports much of the fascination to the player.It's needless to say that there's not much content at the moment and the little there is still requires a lot of work. Right now, a purchase would be less about your own pleasure and more about supporting the devs. With that being said, the core of SNOW is rock-solid, which is why I believe the game deserves support. Even in its current state, SNOW offers a glimpse of greatness and I wish the team the best of luck for this project.			"

								A complete mess!""Snow""If you call your name ""snow"", then what should be one of the main points of the game? Creating the feeling of actually moving on and through snow! Remember Lost Planet 1? You actually moved through snow, got stuck in it, sink in it.Unfortunately, the snow in this game feels like white concrete, there are almost no particle effects, and no effect of your skier or snowboards to actually sink in the snow. They are just clipping through the ground.""Physics"" and ragdollThe physics in this game are a complete mess! Jumps don't feel realistic, the momentum feels random (sometimes you're fast, sometimes not). Even worse then that is the fact, that the ragdoll will trigger almost instantly, when you don't land perfectly on spot! I am aware, that they don't want to be arcade with this one, but this is just frustrating, and nothing more! GraphicsI already mentioned, that the snow does not look like snow at all. But actually just the whole graphical environment looks absolutely bad! All textures look blurry, the effects are cheap. Overall it looks like a game from the launch era of the Xbox360.ConclusionI get, that this is an Early Access titel, but holy moly. This game is an outdated, random mess, that even fails to deliver its most basic core: simulating snow!It is free to play, so you may have nothing to lose but your free time. But even that is something you might want to consider.			"

Early Access Review
								The premise of SNOW is excellent - a beautiful, open world, winter sports with multiplayer support and multiple huge mountain ranges to explore. Unfortunately, Poppermost Productions does not seem to be a company that's able to pull this feat off.SNOW, before the most recent update (~01/04/2016) was an unpleasant but playable game. The currently only option to go is skiing - which was fairly enjoyable (albeit fairly repetitive) on the game's large mountain range. You can respawn in a manner of unlockable locations or on other players on the server which works most of the time (but can be frustrating when someone respawns on you and you lose your bearings :/)After this update, the playability has gone and now it's a buggy mess. If you can make it into a multiplayer game without crashing and needing to restart your PC, you're faced with countless bugs - from falling through the world to being completely overwhelmed by truly horrific hit detection and scoring.The game is unbelievebly unstable - both in the menus that overlap and cause the game to crash and the game's reluctancy to safely Alt+Tab in and out of the game. This can kind of be explained by its 'Early Access' disclaimer, but the game has been out since 2013. SNOW feels like a severely unfinished 'My First Game' that has overrun on its budget both on time and money - as, of course, there's a fully functional store where you can buy in-game licensed products such as skis, gloves, and jackets.TL;DR: SNOW could be a great game, but its seemingly random untested patches, poorly written features and quick gameplay burnout cycle are a fatal concoction that's destined to fail.

								There's a real gem of a game in here but it doesn't want to give up its pleasures without a bit of a fight! I've been desperate for a good snowboarding game since Amped 2 (although Amped 3 was great fun too - just not as rewarding) and I was toying with the idea of Steep or Infinite Air. Unfortunately, Steep just looks like a racing game in an open snowy world (it doesn't even have grinding FFS!) and Inifinite Air gets pretty bad reviews and the demo is shockingly poor as a sales pitch (the producer who let THAT demo out of the door should be fired!).Initially I thought Snow was just too buggy and unpolished but as you invest time in it it really starts to shine. No magic trick combo buttons like SSX, no super-magnetic grinds or impossibly high jumps and a finesse on the controls that takes patience to get to grips with. But as you progress, it all starts to flow and feels really good... and the more time you put in, the more rewarding it gets. After 3 hours I've barely scratched the surface but I've done enough to make me want to forgive the bugs and get better at it. No urge to buy IA or Steep anymore and... its FREE!!Definitely worth trying and definitely worth putting at least an hour into it before you give up. The graphics are pretty decent, the events are good and the game is getting better with each update and as a bonus, if you have a Rift it looks brilliant... although the UI in VR is hard to see and it's even more buggy there - oh and if you try and start it in NON VR with the Rift connected... it'll start in VR anyway but won't work properly. Minor details though - the bottom line is.....This is a great feeling snowboarding and skiing game with HUGE potential that just needs more time and polish. Definitely recommended - what have  you got to lose??			"

								I've been here from the start, I bought into early access and I had high hopes... I've seen it all change for better or worse. The developers are amazing and ambitious but my problem is it's always been average the game isn't amazing but neither is it terrible.The good well the settings are all there screen options, a tonne of advanced graphics settings... all the good stuff! The music is by far my favourite thing in the game there's only a few tracks but those few tracks are so calming and beautiful. You can deck out your character as much as you would like the options are all there clothing wise anyways and with the new addition of snowboarders there's even more! I can say for a small dev team the content updates come out quite frequently which is never a bad thing. Maps are nice and big and online play works for the most part!Now the bad the game is a buggy mess for the most part constant crashes, the physics seem off to me and the wait for snowboards was far to long to warrant how average the gameplay is, what I'm trying to say is I don't think it's fun... it's actually quite boring after the first 2-10mins. As a founder I expected more than what I got, I get it microtransactions is all fine and dandy since it's free now but what about when I paid to support you? A few clothes is all I'm worth... that's great! Aside from free roaming there is nothing else to do the game is tedious, slow and most of all not fun.Look it's fine as a free to play game, I'm trying not to bash it because I wanted to love it and I know plently of people like this game and that's fine but what I expected was Skate in the form of snowboarding/skiing but what I got was a  bland free roaming buggy mess. I've been patient for 3 years and now I finally know were this is headed, I hope all the best to the devs but this game isn't what I'm after... maybe someday in the future but now it's a strong no!

								I've been looking forward to this game for quite some time and was finally able to pick it up. The existing content was already worth my money in my opinion and the planned features just seem even better. The game looks and handles wonderfully for an alpha state. There are obviosuly some imperfect parts as this game is in early access but as an avid snowboarder I am more than happy to support these devs who seem to really care about the project. "

								AWESOME simply awesome. Still in development but has massive potential for multiplayer and multi winter sport event modes. Fluidity, physics and textures as well as playability has been well thought through and designed to acuratley mimic fp or 3rd person skiing experience. Hopefully will also be adaptable to occulus rift down the track. Packed full of adictive features including a great musical score, wide variety of character options, points scoring system for trick based moves (like ssx ps3) snow is a must have not only for winter sports lovers but really for anyone just wanting something a bit different, replayable and adrenaline pumping fun.

								This game may be free, but it just isn't fun. The controls are clunky and unintuitive. The graphics are very basic and there is a lot of weird janky stuff that happens. I mean your snowboard/skis are NON STOP clipping with the ""snow"" on the ground. The physics are terrible. Most the time you just feel like you're going really really slow. If you're barreling down the face of a mountain and you carve or spin around you most certainly do not lose all your momentum. Which brings me to my ultimate point - the game does not FEEL good. It doesn't feel like an authentic representation of what snowboarding/skiing is. I can go back and play SSX 3, a game that came out 13 years ago on the PS2, and it feels better than this game. It's more fun than this game. This game just didn't live up to my expectations. Here's hoping that STEEP can scratch the itch when it comes it.			"

								This game has been nearly 3 years in the making in early access and it seems the only thing they have actively worked on is the implementation of the store and cosmetic items. The game was more playable when it first launched into early access. Controls seem worse then before, interface is just horrible and riddled with bugs, you cant equip the items you own because the interface wont register that you clicked on certain items so your character is stuck wearing default set. They claim this is a free to play open world game but there is little to no interaction with other people. I havnt even seen an option as to how to go about getting into another game with people. 3 years and this game still isnt functional. Its too obvious that the devs decided to cash out by focusing on market items only and letting the game rot. Another company added to the very long list of how game devs are taking advantage of the market. Let this game die, wait for ""Steep"" if youre really wanting a good open world snow game. Its pathetic that games like Cool Boarders and SSX or even Shaun White are the best snow games made to date. Those games outdated mechanics and graphics are better then this heap. Save your time and money cause this game will never be fully released.			"

								Finally i've received the key for early access, i've waited 3 months for received the key.I've played this game for an hour, but long enough to know some good and bad points.First good Great menu (someone will say it's not a great menu. but for me it's)Huge open world for see (or you can choose for a closed circuit), with the soundtrack it's great, complements the overall the gameplay.If you choose for a closed circuit, carefully at the end of the circuit you can get stuck but that can be solved pressing the ""R"" (using that you get penalized with some down points). You can buy some cosmetic but it's only visual (Please still on visual and not P2W).It's good see a winter sport on pc, well doneThe bad (Negative) The jumping mechanics are a bit badly (or a lot) and your jump height is a little low (depends of the circuit you choose if you jump with carefully you can make a Backflip with successful)Controls need to be reworkedGround controls it's good but not at all ( I mean more speed for a big jump, more tricks, points)Air controls i'm not agree with (arrow keys) make the same move except they change the direction of the move you do.The female character, has been forgotten for now on the gameIf you don't wanna pay for test the game, wait until its release ( Will be free )PS: Sorry if i've got an bad english i'm trying to do the best.

								Fun freeskiing game that keeps getting better and better. If you like skiing games, you'll probably like this.Some people seem to have bought this under the impression that it wouldn't at some point become free-to-play (even though it's clearly stated in the Early Access information), so if you think you might be one of those people, definitely don't buy this game, but instead read the Early Access information box again and again until you feel you understand what it says.Also, if you have some awesome alternative monetization plan in mind for Poppermost to use after releasing the game as F2P to use instead of microtransactions for completely cosmetic things, definitely contact them about it instead of leaving a negative review, I'm sure they'd love to hear about it.

								TL;DR at the bottomSNOW is one of those games that you just got to love, exploring the mountain with friends and finding amazing places to ski down and doing trix or make up an Impromptu race on your own.Being an open world game penefits the game alot, the problem with alot of skiing games is that you start at the top and when you are down at the bottom of the hill, you have to start a new session or restart at the top.Here you can just go and return to the top whenever you want.Yes the game got a lot of glitches and some things like the spawning must be corrected, as it is now some random player can spawn on you and accidentally kill you. I would love to see a ""only allow friends to spawn on me"", And when they do spawn they should spawn a few feets behind and not directly on top of you. The game is still in Early Access so hopefully they will correct all the problems.TL;DR:Like Skate3 but on skis.			"

Early Access Review
								*UPDATE 17/02/15* SNOW is finally set to go into 'Closed Beta' soon - which is wicked; look back through the updates and you'll see that I was a bit worried that this game would fall on to the ever-increasing 'Died in Early Access' pile - progress is being made. With every minor update my FPS increases by 10-15, the UI (whilst still buggy) is now 'functional', and the graphical tweaks here and there have really made a difference - this game does genuinely look 'good', not spectacular, but a decent 'good' rating. The controls keep on being tweaked too; I can now compitently get down the Sialia course without having to respawn a billion times and even throw in some 'gnarly' tricks here and there. :DThat being said, the game still lacks motive. What am I supposed to be doing? You get to the bottom of each course and nothing happens. No leaderboard announcement, no objectives to meet - gravity pulls you to the bottom of the course... and that's pretty much it. There is an arbitary score counter, but it doesn't mean anything.I want the 'Closed Beta' to be big. I want a lot of people to come and play this game because it has impressed me, it's come a long way, and it deserves a bit of recognition. There's nothing else like this game on Steam. I REALLY WANT TO RECOMMEND THIS GAME, POPPERMOST; I HONESTLY, HONESTLY DO.....but I can't - £10.99 for this game is crazy. I picked it up two years ago when it was in early Alpha for about £3 (because why not?) £10.99 for Early Access to an F2P game is insane, especially when all you get is some exclusive clothes. If people are playing this game because all they want to do is play 'dress up' with a wireframe, then good for them, but it's getting to the stage where I'd like to see more in the form of 'an actual game' from SNOW and I hope the Beta will show me this.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*UPDATE 25/09/14* The 'M4' patch for this game makes it playable (lol). It's still got a long way to go, mind you. The big addition in this patch is 'sound'. Fitting drum & bass beats over the crisp sloshing and scraping of snow; it's damn good, actually. The new map they added is completely unoptimised, so I got a steady FPS of 4 out of it, but this is an alpha, so it's to be expected.The no. 1 addition for me in this patch is that it proves that there is progression in this game. I'm not readly to 'recommend' it just yet - it is still alpha, but I am hopefull for the next patch. Let's just hope it doesn't take another 10 months.*UPDATE 14/09/14* This game is still completely unplayable. The commands work half of the time, the procedually generated map is not 'procedually generated'; it's just completely random. There is still no sound in it (as in, the game is completely silent - even the UI), and the UI is buggy as hell.*ORIGINAL REVIEW*'Currently in development' is a complete understatement. This game is the reason why the 'Early Access' scheme should have some kind've assurance that the game is even playable.This game is not playable.Come back in a year's time, don't waste your money.

								My friend Adam and I were going down the Graveyard Pass at a blistering speed. Trees were giving off sonic cracks as we blew past them approaching mach 1. If we both hadn't bought the Speed Demon Gear DLC our skin would have been ripped off from the extreme velocity we were going at. At 1300km/h we activated the main thrusters on our skis, sending us down at speeds faster than any vehicle ever created by man. We both risked snapping our necks clean off by turning to each other and giving a thumbs up. This is what we lived for. Pure speed. Adrenaline. Dancing with death, looking it right in the eye and proclaiming ""Not today, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! I do the work. I earn the money. I am the one that decides when to have sex. I have the ultimate power, economically AND physically and I will not doubt for a second to use my full adult male force to put you into back in your place. These strong ♥♥♥♥ing arms have killed before, and if pushed I will not hold back. Spouse or not."".As me and Adam were approaching mach 2 down the mountain, Adam proclaimed he had trouble with his thrusters. I could sense the fear in his voice. Something was wrong. Out of nowhere, his right skis thrusters shot off with full force, ripping his entire right leg off together with the ski. The scream over the radio headset was ear shattering. I tried to focus on staying on track and avoiding crashing into a tree, which would be an instantaneous death, but I had to look. The sight sent a chill down my spine. My best friend was doing his best to hold his form at 2100 km/h with only one leg. I could see in his visor a single tear rolling down his cheek. He turned his head to me, and raised his right arm in a salute, risking his hand getting torn off from the wind pressure. The time had come. I nodded.Adam veered off-track, right into a big pine tree. The red mist of my best friend will be forever imprinted in my memory. The following explosion set off a massive avalanche, the biggest since 2004. The avalanche posed no threat to me due to the sheer speed I was traveling, but the same can not be said for the neighboring ski town of Obersaxen, which was struck by the avalanche and completely submerged by snow. 640 people died. Thankfully our families were not in Obersaxen but in a town 20 or so miles away where I told Adams wife what happened.Sadly Adam wasn't a winner. A winner wouldn't let his best friend ♥♥♥♥ his wife, but Adam did. Adam did the very moment he became meat smoke. Some people were just born weak.			"

I tried lowering graphics to an embarrassingly low quality and it still was tearing and having graphical problems (FYI I can play GTA V on very high graphic settings with no problems).

								since the supreme snowboarding (the greatest snowboard game in means of ... anything - even the soundtrack was dope in that time) and lesser known ""virtual breckenridge"" i was in constant look for playin something that includes snow and snowboards. when i first purchased snow (yes, i paid for that on steam and missed the date i was able to have the money-back) it could not even start on my pc - it was because of dx10 and my graphics card. after a half of a year i had the new one and checked the SNOW again - with all these SNOWBOARDS and SNOWMOBILES and other useless crap like coats and hats.great game! really. if you dont give a flying ducks about buying ingame stuff its a perfect free game about snowboards - there are few more coming, so lets wait what will happen to snow. its all professional, fx are good, but the scoring is highly questionable - i think developers still balancing it and in the finished state its gonna be huge snowboard simulator. no so ""sim"" like ea skate (which has a great ""feature"" - the whole new system of doing tricks - forget about that ollie+left+flip from thps) but not so frontiers-breaking and techologically perfect. still a great office game if you like snow, boards, ski and snowmobile. huge map, great abilities, but it wont go smooth on an ""office"" computer - u should have something more powerful to make that misty flip over the next two hills8.8/10			"

								Insanely fun game at the very best price.... $0.00Free roaming the beautiful mountains is peaceful, exhilarating and adventurous. Fitting music too. The mountain is HUGE! I instantly fell in love.You gain experience from free roaming and doing events based on the tricks you do. The exp levels you up and unlocks stuff. There are plenty of different events for you to do. Races, time trials, freestyle events, Speed runs, etc. The amount of memorable moments I had in the first 20 minutes of playing.... it's insane... Crazy jumps off waterfalls and frozen riverbeds, off-piste manuvours that made me crash in hillarious ways, jumping off massive clifs and landing on houses, hotels. Oh man..Multiplayer is brilliant. You can spawn on any players instantly after dying, or at any of the usual spawn points. Plenty of fun moments like accidently crashing into each other at high speeds, mid air. If this were a demo I would happily buy the game.It's early access. Expect plenty more content. Get it. Play it. Enjoy it. Fall in love...			"

There are some things that still could be ironed out, but that's a given seeing its still in beta. I can't wait until the next update so I can customize my rider more than what I have. Looking forward to the future, this game can only get better.			"

								A free-to-play open-world skiing game that allows you to free roam online (and offline) in a sizable mountain environment as well as partake in several events. The visuals are nice to look at, the skiing with others can be fun, and the game-world will keep you busy for hours exploring.As of writing this, the restrictions for this free-to-play is primarily cosmetic related, and nothing that stops you from playing really. The prices for cosmetic items aren’t unreasonable – maybe 10-15 pounds to outfit your entire outfit with whatever you want, sort of the price of a typical game. There is no pay-to-win items, as it’s simply cosmetics, and no consumables, so really once you’ve got your looks sorted, that’s likely all you’ll want to spend. Not that you really need to spend any money at all to simply play the game. So if you want to go skiing, or maybe just want to see some snow, then SNOW delivers, with no cost involved at simply trying it for yourself.			"

								In a post-Steep world, SNOW is a monumental waste of money. The microtransactions are a slap in the face to anyone who backed this game from the beginning. Want to unlock the snowmobile? Have fun grinding to level 65+ without spending a single coin on unlocking levels or any other gear. The business model seems based on the prevalent model for mobile games, and I'd advise people to not give these people your money.			"

								It's fun, it's beautiful, it has... snow.It delivers on what it claims to be. I'm more of a free-roam kind of player and the maps are beautiful and fun to explore. (...and cold :D )It's been in development for quite some time now, but it is still getting decent updates. I only really paid into it because snowboarding has been a planned feature forever(I'm a boarder irl), but for now It's still pretty fun. The big brand names aren't a huge selling point for me, however I do think it's pretty cool that I can brand match some of my IRL gear and my avatar looks pretty close to what I actually wear.If you're a fan of skiing/snowboarding/skateboarding games, or skiing/snowboarding IRL then this game is worth checking out, especially since it's going to be f2p.

								Very dissapointing.I bought this game ago while it was still around $30 and while it was still in alpha build. After only playing an hour of the alpha build, I got sick of it. The controls were very weird and janky and the menus were glitchy.After hearing it is going into closed beta, I checked it out again as I was already in the closed beta.It got better... I guess... but it still didn't deserve $30. The graphics look pretty nice, and the moutains/courses look fun as hell. If only I could play them... Just kidding, you can play them. But not to what you think a ski game should feel like. The controls in the closed beta weren't any different to the alpha, which is a dissapointment. I think the only improvements that should be made which will make the game 1000x better are:-Better controls-More tricks-Feel faster (going down a hill feels slow as ♥♥♥♥)-Easier to navigate menus (It's hard as jeopardy)-and free, exclusive dlc to those who actually BOUGHT this soon to be free-to-play game.(That last one may be asking too much)To Poppermost, fix your game. This game has so much potential. I was thinking this game would be similar to the EA Skate franchise but to me, it's more similar to playing minesweeper with actual mines. While blindfolded.			"

I am writing this review while SNOW is in open beta.As an F2P game I think SNOW is really a really amazing winter sports game.It has a big open mountain and few smaller maps (all parks at the moment) on which you can spend hours of exploring.Real life parks/jumps like Sochi (olympic winter games 2014, named Fochi ingame) and the X Games (named S Games ingame). And also a real X Games course! And on the main non-exisiting mountain (Sialia) you have some real life spots like Chad's Gap (on which Tanner Hall 'broke' both his ankles).It has a leveling system with which you can get rewards, think of events, items and credits (ingame currency)If you are a skiër or snowboarder you will probably really like this game.Good graphicsA lot of character customization (which costs credits which you can buy or get by leveling up)Multiplayer is a lot of fun (with friends)Clothing and gear form existing brands like Faction, Head, Red Bull, Scott, Line etc.PC and PS4 cross platform! It isn't advertised as such but believe me, it actually is :)Very nice and active devs (on discord)I flollowed SNOW since december 2013 and it has made improvements over the time, there were not that much updates but when they pushed out one, it was a big one. (not always very stable, but I can't blame anyone since it is early acces).You can also talk directly with the developers and the active community on the official discord server! (link on the steam forum)So yeah..It basically is an awesome wintersports game with a few minor bugs that I would really recommend to try since it is free to play.9/10 Would crash into a friend again			"

								I've played this for a few moments but long enough to know some of the good and bad points of the game in its current state. First the good:Fabulous visuals and a soundtrack that complements the overall scenery and gameplayPlanned features like snowboarding (snowmachining too please?)HUGE area, no boundaries that ive found though you will get stuck if you arent careful.WINTER SPORTS ON PC!Microtransactions are cosmetic only (Please keep it this way, no pay2win plz.)(Snowball fights please :P)The negative (Soon to be fixed id imagine)Jumping mechanics are a bit wonky and your jump height is a little low (Being a snowboarder a can verify that it is possible to jump higher than 1ft.)Controls need to be reworked for controllers (holding forward on the control stick should make you lean forward instead of holding the button. Prepping for a jump should not impede your ability to turn and should also provide the speed boost that ducking provides. There are a number of other things but these are the most prominent.)The above are really the only things i see wrong atm.I have played a lotm of amp'd and shawn white snowboarding and I definately see a huge amount of potential for this game. Good work so far devs, keep it up!			"

								overall a very fun game if you like games like this kind of games.as the game states use a controller it works well but if you want to freestyle like the ssx games - go to setting and turn on: swap roll and grap. --------------------------rails need to be worked on and multiplayer connection can be aproved ( when you land perfect sometimes you bug in the ground and die )---------------------------only downside to me is that the crashes can be frustrating when your having fun.---------------------------with a little bit of work this can be a very fun and enjoyble game.( to all new players turn in your points so you can lvl up you will get free credits for lvling and if you do single player events also multiplayer has some cool things to get credits )rating: contoller support  9/10  -  gameplay - 7/10 (bugges/crashes) -  customization 8/10 ( can be a bit pricey )  -  music  6/10 ( not bad but could be better )			"

Sometimes you have to restart at the open screen if it doesnt come up with the credits, after some events it will restart the game. However, if you can look past the tiny bugs then this game is a super cool snowboarding / skiing game.You can do events, time trials and free roaming. Level up to get in game coins and buy stuff. It's such a chill, beautiful game if you can look past your derpy looking character. 8/10 recommend.			"

								I love that there is a open mountain skiing game but...in alpha there was an amazing selection of skis and gear and the second it hit beta we lost everything...I know this should not be a huge deal but the fact that I could use my own gear I really own was awesome and now we get 1 of each peice and they do not look nice.1 gross jacket, 1 ugly set of skis (2 if you count the old single tips you get from paying for the game)also the fact that they made every last thing cost money you would think that those of us that payed more way earlier would at least get some in game tokens to get back a small peice of the gear we once had for free... but no.Its an enjoyable game and if you could care less about what your character looks like then go for it!but I honestly feel cheated having access to all this stuff at alpha and nothing now... I already have to pay for all this gear in real life like common haha.I may just be over reacting due to the fact that I had access to all of this stuff at one point so if you never played the Alpha then I think you may enjoy this but coming from having more earlier...it kind of seems like a back step to me.I have to give it a thumbs down tho due to the fact the last update seemed to strip the game clean in the gear area			"

The menus are beautiful, There are multiple mountains, the graphics are outsanding, and there is virtually no lag. This is one of the best games i have ever played, especially since the new update. My only gripe with this game is the in-game purchases. However, if you do not mind this, then please get this game. I give it a 9/10. OUTSTANDING.			"

								Got into the closed beta when it first came out and loved it. Played it for more that 100 hours. But they slowed down production and for a while it seemed the project was dead, so I stopped playing. A while later I went on youtube and saw that it was all over my front page and I was super excited because I thought they came out of beta and added all they promised! But the reason it was on the front page was because they completely broken the game and all of its physics (or lack there of). I was dissapointed but still had some fun with my friends.

								At the present time, I do not recommend purchasing this game. Although the concept is awesome, and I'm really excited to play this when it's finished however - this is not a playable game just yet. Lots of bugs, lots of errors, lots of crashes.Bide your time for a little longer and buy this when it becomes 100% ready to play. I see great things for this game in the future, but no, not right now.******** UPDATE: 1 YEAR LATER (April 2015)I bit the bullet and tried playing this game again, and I must say it has improved massively since a year ago as I actually managed to ski down a slope. Some progress at last! However, it still lacks a certain oooomph. You have to pay for extras, which is absolutely ludicrous. I feel like they could have done a lot more to the game in the whole year that I have been waiting to play again. In my opinion, it's STILL not ready to be released as a full game, as it just feels unfinished to me. I will come back to this review in a few months to try once again.			"

								Don't advise paying to test very very early prototype which is going to be free-to-play soon anyway. Wait until it's free as there isn't enough to get your teeth into at the moment in terms of gameplay (unfortunately I found this out the hard way). Note that there is no sound of any kind currently in-game.			"

								I dont usually write reviews about gaes but after the last update i do feel like i have to. The was real good fun until the last update which ♥♥♥♥ed up pretty much everything there is to ♥♥♥♥ up. I have a pc capable of running this game at 60ish fps on ultra settings so that isnt the problem, but since the last update, even on lowest settings, it is impossible to ride down a mountain without crashing into a tree or a arock because they now just randomly pop up 10m infront of you without a warning. This is really annoying because there is nothing you can do about it. Furthermore loading times have increased a lot. They have at least trippled. And another thing i cant stand at all are microtransactions. You can buy items (eg. skis, jackets, goggles) at the ingame shop for funds which you can earn by playing - or you just take the easy approach and buy them for real life money. (500 for 5 dollars from which you can buy like two goggles)Before this update i would have said buy this game, go for it it is awsome. Afterward it sucks really bad. If it stays this way, which i hope it wont i wont advise anyone to buy it.			"

								Great game, much like a skiing simulator. Realistic and smooth. So snow is a snowsports game, where you can eather ski or snowbard, you can go multiplayer over a Mountain, much lika a oper world snowsports game.There is a park for those who like to rail and jump, and some thrilling mountainsides for the back-country orrienten kinda guy.If you like to ski or snowboard and have been waiting for a new, realistic and realy fun game in genre.Well then SNOW is the game for you.Did i mention you can ride i 1st person aswell? NO? well you can, and if awsome but very hard.Enjoy!			"

								Keep an open mind...I've been playing for a good 27+ hours, and I'm level 33. This game is obviosly still in development meaning that its not perfect. leveling up is tedious and you get paid only every 5 levels but the pay does increase but they did this for a reason, since the game is free they want you to buy the money packs so that you can buy what you want and fund them at the same time. So I see both sides of the equasion, players want the money to be more easily earned but also the developer is giving the game for free and making profit off of the money packs. I haven't bought any money pack or plan on it at all because i dont mind the grind too much for making the money but I would rather have a sense of accomplishment and make a smaller amount every level and have that build up. Also a reason I do enjoy this game so much is because I haven't had a good snowboarding game to play since Amped 3 and that game is in a gengre of it's own but anyways Amped 3 game me a childhood dream to go out and snowboard, and this game furthur feeds that dream. All in all this game has its problems but with more work and funding I'm sure it will become an amazing final product			"

								SNOW is honestly a really underrated game. The graphics are beautiful and you cant beat the price.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~PROS:Graphics are very pretty, and realistic, also I think its worth a mention that considering this game is still in early access it it optimized very well never experience any lag with my pc.Open world, I think with a game like SNOW having an open world is great! *Cough unlike mirrors edge Cough*Free! cant beat the price, and for the amount of work this game must have taken I am very surprised.Multiplayer is great and playing with a friend in this game can be fun.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~CONS:Micro-Transactions, OK OK this isn't really a big deal because the only thing that money will do in this game is change aesthetics but its still kinda annoying :/Buggy as hell, however this is expected because this is still in development and not finished.Physics can be poor at times, especially grinds. This can be a problem but in general its funnier than it is annoying~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Conclusion:Honestly if you're thinking of downloading this game, do it. its free and a great game just to relax on.

The events are fun only wish they had more and wish you could earn credits easier.

								This is what I always wanted in an ssx game, its a little more dumbed down and realistic, yet you can still pull off some cool tricks. The main mountain in the game holds hours of exploring and different slopes :Dpros -skis-basically open world-GOING TO have multiplayer-Good dev team-lots of extra little things for people to find-Gives the rush of an  ssx gamecons - no snowboards (yet)- you can crash into the littlest things- landing usually takes away lots of your speed unless your perfectly straight- only 1 mountain so far-other levels beside the main mountain need work- have to either farm or buy the in game currency to get items- items dont have an impact on your stats If you like exploring and winter, buy this game.

								Past the hilariously bad ragdoll physics, and the all-too occaisonal glitching, I enjoy this game.For its price during the winter sale, I'm very content with the game. The mechanics and the tricks feel decently saticfying, and the secondary focus on exploration gives an interesting side objective, because the locale for SNOW is actually quite pretty. Though, it's pretty open-ended, and there isn't much you can do at the time besides explore the mountain and practice new tricks, which has kept me interested thus far. But on the other hand, There is an inane number of glitches, from being frozen in air on spawn, sometimes falling through the map, and, most notably, those friggin` ragdolls, are probably what earned this game a mixed review.I understand that the devs are trying to work around the core aspects of the game mechanics before improving the look of the game, and that's understandable.Give this game a shot, I think it has some potential, but it was released a little early for its own good.

								As much as I do like the basic concept, at it's current state, this game really doesn't have much to offer, and it has a lot of basic stuff missing. Whilst the core mechanics are there, and it's fairly enjoyable to just ski down the mountainside, there is the unfortunate fact that physics are halfway there, there's a lot of animations missing, and overall this feels like a prototype more than an actual product. If you are interested in game development and want to see how the product evolves in front of you in a tangeable way, go right ahead, since it promising, but if you expect a functional base that has just some polishing and additional feature missing, you'll be disapointed.

								I purchased your game about 2 years ago. Its gameplay has always been very good and I have had a lot of fun over the years. But the fact that items (mostly skies and jackets) are so expensive made me a little disapointed.I think that the event system could be further exploited by adding prises for getting a medal. For example, if you put the prices of the skies and other items up to a realistic price(mabey their actual retail price) you could give a few bucks for each medal earned. That way there would be a chance to obtain items whitout buying credits by being a good player and not just a rich dude. This would probably solve a bit of the crisis you have on your hands.Also, i think that the level system you were talking about is interesting you should mabey ask the community for their favorite items and put those ones in the level system.

								I love the concept and gameplay for the game. That is, once you actually figure it out. The controls on the menu doesn't work for me, so I had to look them up online. WHAT GAME DOES THAT?! The game is still very buggy, with the constant skis fading through snow and your character flying after crashing(which I think is cool). Not to mention the issue where full screen will constantly mess with you if you go back to desktop, or the field of view doing the same thing between drop points. I don't care about the micro transactions. If you actually play the game for that long where you want to buy them, you may need to reconsider your life, but hey, that's all you. I personally enjoy the game for the bugs it has, as it makes the game a little enjoyable, and I love skiing and stuff, so I find this game cool. Not to mention the soundtrack, which pulls the player into the game to a great extent. However, I feel that you take too long to speed up and stuff like that. I want to be at breakfast speeds, pulling off huge, gigantic combos, not rapidly crashing, breaking my combo, which should be fixed, as many angles which look natural and ready to fly off of don't work. There also should be more mountains. I like the idea of one, huge, custom mountain, but the other tracks also need some love. I am amazed by this game, but for the average gamer, I do NOT RECCOMEND this title.EDIT: A major update has occured, making the game run smoother (at least for me) and added 2 new mountains. This brings up a few more issues I have with the game, or at least these areas. These areas are way too bland. There is no character or style to these new ""mountains"". It looks like a white floor with mountainy walls. Unlike the big, hulking mountain, which is named whatever, that one has all of these areas that at least feel a little bit special. I actually feel like I'm on a mountain. Another big issue, or suggestion I have is to add snowboards to the game. This would basically just be a cosmetic change, but it would make sense since the game is called SNOW and not SKI. Still wouldn't reccomend.			"

								Well, I did buy this, but it didn't offer much of a fun experience. The comments since the update have strongly put me off playing the game again.It's a shame that this is advertised as a Free-to-Play with customization, because by the looks of it, all the customization is paid now. I probably won't be playing this again unless I see a change in optimism from people who have played the game more recently.The game, not being released to the public for free yet, still has time to change. My advice to the devs would be to listen to the feedback being posted here, and my advice to the players would eb to make sure the devs hear your voice, because this will be vital to both your experience playing, and the developers success.

								This is a review for the closed beta of SNOW so I may update it later on. Just be aware that things will be different than from the time of this post (3/10/15)SNOW is a game I've been keeping an eye on from time to time. As the only (and last) winter sports F2P game, it's a niche game that has a ton of potential. It plays slightly less realistic than Amped but not over-the-top as SSX/Amped, it requires a lot of time to get used to it's controls and physics.Pros: A massive mountain with unique spots to go to, instantaneous loading to spots and restarts, really nice soundtrack and graphics.Cons: Grinding is still a bit wonky and physics can be inconsistant at times, not too much events to do at the moment, multiplayer requires port-forwarding or use of third-party programs like Hamachi.This game so far is a very enjoyable experience and seems to get better after every update. Provided that you can get past its faults, it's worth jumping into the game.			"

								The next SSX? No, not only because it appears to follow a more simulation style than SSX but because the gameplay feels a bit wonky and not very ease to use even though it's a simulator. Although its overall shape is good, the inner core just doesn't feel much solid, it really does worry me this simulation choice over a revamp of a SSX arcade gamestyle and I believe they could try improve the gimmicks of the game without spoiling the rest of the content already developed. Still considering how good the development seems to be going and overall quality of the game I'l thumb it up to try get it more spotlight despite I can't really say I'd endorse people to buy early access but rather hope to get a closed beta key like I did.My discussions thread where I wrote a more in depth description of the game's main problems.

								This game is tons of fun and a very interesting concept I have had a great deal of fun playing it in the time that I've owned it and I definitely recommend. The game has a lot of potential and I am excited to see where the game goes. Not only that but the first-person + Oculus = too much fun.			"

								this game is worth the money.is has 1 huge map (+other smaller maps) and you can spend hours stunting around and getting new spawnpoints.for the microtransactions part, it is ONLY if you want it! it's not a pay to win kinda thing, just outfits.And if you level up, you get stuff (and in-game credits), so you don't have to pay to look cool.it is just great fun to play!also, the devs are really nice guys and they even have a discord page where you can:-report bugs-chat with devs and players-ask questions and get answers quicklyyou can really see that the devs are working hard to make a great game for us <310/10 would dive into SNOW again.....         get it ;)I'll show myself out.

 Snow is a stunning game which has pretty good graphics. If you are keen on skiing or snowboarding, it is definitely a good pick for you. Obviously, Snow is currently in Open Beta, so as a result there are minor bugs and glitches. The layout is really good, because of its simplicity. Lastly, the community and devs are very helpful. I have accidently bought an item twice and I got a refund. I would highly recommend playing this game due to the fact that it is a ""cheaper"" version of STEEP and in my humble opinion Snow has a lot of potential.			"

								-Some might find it too buggy/Glitchy which is -Not that big of a Deal considering it's Early access and the mountains are Huge!-Others like myself can deal with a few bugs since the game isn't harsh on the player.-Whatever you think, it's stil Early Access and Free so keep your Salts ready. but not too much, they melt the Snow.At the end, It's surprisingly comparable to for example Steep.but it's still in Early access & FreeToPlay!That kinda makes it a winner in my book.But at least there's nothing to lose in here.

								There has never been a game for pc that satisfies my craving for games like skate 3 and ssx. Until now. So far, it is looking to be a very good game, and while it kinda sucks there is no way to grind out new gear, the gameplay itself from what I've experienced is really fun. It has some bugs and crashes but it's early acess so that's expected. It is totally worth 10 dollars to get acess to this really fun open world experience. You can explore multiple mountains freely, do crazy tricks and jumps and speed down slopes no sane person would ever speed down. I hope that the devs countiue their awesome work and we all end up with the what looks to be the definative winter sports game for pc!PS I'd love some way to add your own music to the game's soundtrack, hopefully it will be incorperated sometime in the future!

								This an outstandingly beautiful game with Cryengine 3. It is a freeroaming game all about skiing. You can tricks jump half way down mountains. you can do relaxeing skiing down smooth slopes, or do some hardcore skiing down extreme, rocky grades. The game works very smoothly, the players movements arn't jerky, it actually looks like how a real skiier would look. hopefully in the future players will be able to create there own maps for this. If I were to compare this game to any other, it would be like Skate 3, but skiing. It deffinatly has a few knots to work out, but i can see it being a very popular game in the future. I hope this review was helpful :)           -Jcoreder			"

								SNOW is a 'Exellent' Game- Fun to play with freinds- Easy to navigate ( Interface )- Clean Interface - Easy controls- Big Open Areas to explore- Graphically Pleasing- Rewarding when pulling off stunts/tricks- Unique Xp system- Challenging yet rewarding Events- Good slection of musicBut 'Exellent' Games aren't Perfect- Server connection issues  ( Dissconnects you from joining a server frequently)  ( Character Freezes often, leaving you without free movement)- Crashes Frequently when Navigating the Menu's and when joining a server.- Minor input Lag- Not much to do ( in terms of multiplayer, There is only free roam)- Physics Glitches E.G ( Character sliding on vertical walls with no momentum)- Player Glitches through Objects often  - Music becomes repetitive and  monotonous ( Would be nice if players can add their Own music )Overall I belive this is a game worth downloading as it is Free To Play.But as i have only played 4.6 Hours it truly shows how quickly you can become uninterested.So yes I do reccomend this game as these Bugs are often Frequent in many Titles on Steam as it is in early access I look foward to futher updates to come.

								Ah yes... The game we've all been waiting for, for a long time. I have always wondered as to why there haven't been too many ""realistic"" (or even close to it) skiing/snowboarding games. It has always been some sort of jumping over mountains doing sextuple backflips. Why? I don't know. I first heard about this lovely game from a friend, when I was asking him that very same question. He pointed me towards this, I watched a couple of videos and then fell in love.This game is just perfect. It has a huge variety of tricks you can do, a huge variety of rails you can hit and just  a huge map to shred! I love the first person mode (especially with changing the FOV to 110) while riding. Riding through the woods at a massive speed is really exhilarating. The game plays really well. The tricks look cool, the park is smooth and... awesome and the epicness and softness of freeriding is exquisite. I have played the game for almost 50 hours now, and I keep on finding new places to ride and love. The level of customization is pretty neat too (even though there are no khaki pants whatsoever). But even though the game has all that, my favorite part is the devs. I have contacted the team numerous times through twitter and they have always been super fast and helpful with their awnsers. Just the other day, I suggested that they add movable lights to the game (for street spots and such), and their awnser was ""That's a great idea! We'll make sure to include that"". I also remember asking them on a livestream of the game in a super early version about building kickers and stuff, and they said that they are already working on it. All this from a super small team from Stockholm! 8,5/10 (Because no khakis)*Note* I'm a snowboarder waiting for snowboards to be implemented. The review was based on skis. Probably would've forgiven the khaki issue if the snowboards would be in it already.Great job guys, we all love you-Haze*Edit 9.03.2015*As a un-biased reviewer, I have to mention the fiasco that is S-Games. The devs told me on twitter that the map would be released at the end of January. Now that it is early March and there is still no sign of it, I am a bit disappointed and sad about it. I was also super excited to try out the open beta on the 10th of March, but just noticed that it is only available for Tester and Founder pack owners. I totally understand why they are doing this, but when they first released it, I understood that it would've been released for all of us - and so did many others. Don't get me wrong, I still think it's an amazing game, and you should totally get it, but I had to bring these issues up. Let's hope S Games comes with the open beta (god knows when that will be).

								A few months ago I would have totally recommended this game to anyone who enjoyed ""Skate"" (for the consoles) as well as skiing. It was a promising early release, but this most recent update has ruined my hope for this game. I paid 15.99 for this game when I originally purchased it. Back then, all customization was free and a fun aspect of the game. Now the customization is riddled with micro transactions and I'm being told that the game I paid $16 for is soon to be released for free (and is also cheaper now then when I purchased it).All in all it truly is a great game with a TON of potential. But the developers going money hungry is causing a turn for the worst, and I am no longer optimistic of the future of this game. I feel swindled.			"

For gods sake make it so you can have every item, but in turn have to buy the game. All this is, is a skhem to get money, people buy the game thinking its free but no, YOUR CHARACTER IS STUCK LOOKING LIKE A JACK WAGON AND YOU HAVE TO PAY $5 FREAKING DOLLARS TO GET ENOUGH MONEY TO HAVE MAYBE TWO SETS CLOTHES. I would rate this thumbs up IF THERE WASN'T MICRO TRANSACTIONS. This is just a spit in the face to the supporters who bought the beta. Please don't go down this route, please.			"

								50% relaxing and escaping to the mountains, 50% having fun.It’s easy to get immersed in this simple, yet realistic game, as you’ll raise your bottom from your chair when you dive from an icy cliff. A big frigid “open world” and endless skiing tracks and tricks are the ingredients of an après-ski cocktail that tastes like freedom. The music playlist, with mostly amazing chillstep or energizing beats, gets a little repetitive after a while, as does the gameplay, but it constantly gives you that peculiar combination of zen and vigor.As a skier myself, I can say that this is a great simulation for when you want to escape the stress in your life. Not quite comparable with the real thing, but the gameplay is good, and the visuals and music are even better, even on my somewhat older laptop.			"

								I would have paid the $130 game gold edition for this game for the content that is released so far. I bought the founders pack on day one so I already made the leap to help this game develop. Here we are a few years since then and I'd pay even more if I could.Let's get to the negative reviews. First to the people who bought founders pack and complain about not having access to all the items like you could before. The devs want this to be a f2p game so they have to do something to be able to keep the game in development because they still have so many plans for the game. If you were early to buy the founders pack like me then I hope you would understand that you paid that early backer price to help game development not get exclusive attention( except a few items). Some reviews are just way to harsh on a game that is still a work in progress.So get this game and start practicing! You see all these edits of people doing crazy realistic tricks and you know what they aren't easy so it's going to take some practice. But I think that's the kind of experience I am looking for in a skiing game. Not to mention the devs are super active with the community and discuss and implement community ideas all the time it's amazing. There's nothing that will tear me away from loving the SNOW game and community!			"

								Being a major park skier myself, I've waited a long time for a game like SNOW to arrive after playing SSX and being disappointed with only being able to play as a snowboarder (ew). I've had a lot of fun so far with this game, and I think it definitely does a service to the newschool skiing community. As for the game itself-- so far it's still in Beta, but already updates are showing to be drastic- and in a good way. Multiplayer is much more stable now, and the shop isn't as oversaturated with useless items because Poppermost removed most of the ones that people didn't buy. Hopefully the future will bring more realistic rail-grind mechanics (only feet are detected on rails) and possibly cheaper prices in the shop, as in the closed beta store options were ridiculously expensive- and had to be bought with only real money. All in all, I'm not looking forward to this being a great game--because it already is.			"

It had its problems there, however, with graphical bugs and the like and many other problems with optimization, controls, and UI. Now with the closed beta, theyve taken everything that was early access and made it worse. They made a nice, clean menu: Big. ♥♥♥♥ing. Deal. The performance is terrible, there are more texture bugs than  the day i bought the early acess, and now there is a MICROTRANSACTION SHOP FOR A BETA GAME. Really? I paid 30 bucks to get the content someone who paid 10 bucks can get? Oh no but I get a bronze helmet and a top; hat who gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥ $5 for a set of goggles and some ♥♥♥♥ing skis is rediculous in beta and these devs have completley destroyed the reputation of this game.

The game is Freestyle Skiing.Has a Tutorial, but it needs more explanation and make it easier.  The tutorial teaches you tricks, some very hard to complete.Try it, if you like snow sports games.For more info:

								It's a nice and relaxing game but with there only being a 7 frankly tiny maps (Two of which are DLC) it make this game feel like more like a demo than a real fully fleeged game.Bigger maps would be much better for a game like this.Just note though I'm bit biased from playing the SSX Games so I might have been expecting to much.

								Avoid like your crazy ex. To start with the least annoying aspect of the game; there's no way to look at the controls. I realise this is early access, and I accept that, but it doesn't tell you what they are in the tutorial apart from ""w to move forward"". Really needs to either have a completed tutorial or an option to view the controls. Then we can move onto the complete lack of ingame music, and because of that, a buzzing sound is in its place. There are plenty more problems, including paying EXTRA to play with friends, and the achievement for finding Nouk not actually granting the achievement. Not a good start to release on, and have people PAY for. It has the potential to become something great.. but this game doesn't even feel alpha yet.			"

Early Access Review
								Pros:-Sweet graphics-A big mountain with several smaller maps-Solid skiing mechanicsCons:-People that didnt read before buyingI got real interested in this game when I first heard about it years ago. A f2p mmo snow-sports game. My main interest was its odd combination of the genres along with a curiosity for how the f2p model would look. Obviously there would be cosmetics, but will there be passes to ski down certain mountains and enter tournaments? Most likely. In its current state it feels very ""in-developement"" in lack of ways to describe it, which can make it feel empty at times, but I check in every now and then and its a slow but steady process of improvements. With that said, the game is solid enough to have fun with.			"

								This game looks visually astounding and comes packed with brand name products, and as a skier myself this game is pretty sweet, but PLEASE DO NOT buy this game.SNOW used to be an entirely free to play game, as they promised it would be, although I chose to support them as soon as the game hit steam in early beta; now its a ♥♥♥♥ing joke when it comes to micro-transactions.In order to dress you character up in the gear you want, you need to spend real money to purchase credits with NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE to obtaining credits.Furthermore, this game is a broken piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥and they are still trying to comb money from supporters through these microtransactions. If you do not have an audio set up (ie. speakers or headphones), dont expect to run this game as it will crash when attempting to start it up. When navigating the menu, you will also find that clicking on certain options will crash your game aswell.Just as you think this game couldn't get any more awful as it progresses through its beta stage, you're way ♥♥♥♥ing wrong. This games optimization when it was first released on steam was prestine. First time I went to start it up, I could run on my settings maxed with a solid 60 frames; now, with an even better rig, this game stutters and hiccups every time I attempt to play and enjoy a 30 minute session.For now, please DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Many have written an identical review to mine, and hopefully the developers hear what we're exclaiming.			"

								First off this game is one of the better skiing games I've played and I've had a lot of fun with it, but I'd have to recommend againt buying it. Currently there is no sound in the game, the multiplayer is off limits and there's only one mountain to choose from. Once these are fixed I'd definetly say it's worth the early access price, even if it'll be free sometime later this year			"

								This was an ok game... Until I went first person and it was profound! Awesome work. I'm a fan of the first SSX, cos it was about SPEED. Let's face it, tricks are boring and I suppose they have their place but I would ask the devs to make them optional. It's too weird in 1st person and very sensitive.Honestly, forget the tricks and just give us more STEEP. Multiplayer World Championship downhill ffs			"

Early Access Review
								Bought this in spite of the reviews warning on lack of sound/minimal snow-to-skis interaction yadda yadda and willingly spent money on it anyway. My reason? Because SNOW markets itself as a ski MMO; the multiplayer was basically my main source of intrigue. Upon reading through the descriptions of different purchasable (packs before paying my £5.99), there was no material to suggest multiplayer wouldn't be available in the cheapest possible purchase. Imagine my disgust when the multiplayer option in-game demands more money in order to become available. What's more, there is no obvious forum where I could (if I had no self respect) through more money at SNOW to acquire multiplayer. Having quitted the game frustrated and confused, I notice that at the bottom of this page, under the ""Planned Features"" sub-heading, the developpers have placed 'multiplayer'; if this is their disclaimer that we are indeed paying money for a feature that isn't yet in game, then they need to do a bloody better job of getting the message across. Something like 'multiplayer not yet available' would be GREAT up at the top right where they promise us that SNOW is ""alone or with friends"".Another disappointment was the promise of in-game challenges, both in multiplayer AND single-player. In fact, ""Solo events and Challenges"" is under the ""Key Features"" sub-heading, showing that it should be available already. So where are they? What challenges have been set? Even after a 1.5 hour sitting I found myself still floating around with no direction as the game doesn't appear to offer anything in-game or in the menu other than an ""exclusive event"" - which also demands more money.Finally, to top off my own personal experience: in the character customisation it appears to be impossible to see the player's head, which makes headgear and goggles impossible to customise, and other than the (god-awful-doesn't-even-deserve-the-name) tutorial, the only map available seems to be Sialia. Thinking this is a personal (inexplicable?) problem as other disappointed reviewers still seem to be able to get 3 maps...All in all, SNOW had a great concept which I loved enough to dismiss the bad reviews, hoping that its coolness (*cough* MULTIPLAYER) would pay off for the lack of sound, or bad gameplay. What I didn't expect was to invest in a product which failed to deliver on aspects it Had promised, and leave me feeling cheated out of aspects it Appeared to have promised. Maybe it was down to bad marketing on Steam, but either way this ""game"" is not worth its selling price in its current state. Once they've fixed key issues, installed multiplayer, improved customisation (hey maybe even throw in a female skier/boarder?) then maybe it could be worth thinking about parting with £8.99. Right now, I'm frankly disgusted that I spent £5.99 on SNOW.			"

YouTube™ Video: SNOW - Why You Should Avoid Early Acces Games! 

			Views: 297		

			So, what I was buying into, was an alpha test. I went against all my principles, and it proved to be a very costly mistake.		

So, what can be said about this game. Less said the better maybe. The idea behind the game, and the promise is there. However, this game is also a very good example of what's wrong with the gaming industry these days, and also how Early Access games can be so wrong.First of all, the whole notion of paying to test a game, is a weird one. Then paying to be able to test a future Free 2 Play game seems a bit out of order. People buying into this for 55 EUR, do need to love the game, to defend the use of money.So, what about the actual game then, it does not have any sounds, what so ever, not placeholdersounds, not any background music, not a thing. There is a big lack of options, and while they might not want you to rebind the keys at the current moment, you should be able to look at the controls, to at least know what to click.There is a tutorial in the game, that is somewhat small, and it does contain spelling mistakes - makes the game look unserious. But you won't be able to know everything to do by the tutorial.There are no visual effects in the game, in the way of snow being kicked up, or traces of skis - the same skis that you find to be just as often under the snow, as up on the snow.The game also have random errors, sometimes things work, sometimes they don't. This goes for the tutorial, the cabin, graphics settings.All things are stuff that can be added before the release. However, there has not been an update in 2.5 months, and it seems more and more like a distant dream to see this game in it's full pride.There is so much promise behind the idea - but there is no guarantee that anything will work out.EDIT: As it turns out (by the dev.response here), it does get updated more often - it just doesn't show on the store page or on the community page (high up), so you would need to check the discussions to find it.However, I will still say that this is a good example on why Early Access games are a bad thing. And that if you really want the game, wait for it to be F2P. It's not worth the price for it, at current time - sadly.-Myrvold			"

Early Access Review
								SNOW's style is beautifully executed and its simple concept is one that's been sorely needing attention in an FPS-and-wacky-story-tacky-mechanics-geeky-sentiments-laden game industry lately, but it simply feels like running poor taste toilet humor minigames created in the late 90's Macromedia Shockwave/Flash era. Just running it feels like I'm using the slowest, jerkiest FPS ever invented. Nevermind getting actual gameplay accomplished, I simply can't get to it regardless of how low I place quality settings threshholds. Admittedly I *do* use a non-gaming dedicated system, but I *can* play a ton of games with even huger processing demands than this thing with no issues whatsoever. Mind you, all of these performance issues were forgivable given that I did buy in with the knowledge it was a work in progress, and I even touted that as such to friends who normally steer clear of anything that could even remotely sports-related. However, what put me off completely was that it's obviously a failing project and becoming nothing more than an overrated skiing version of Farmville with cr(app)y in-game purchases. No thanks, guys. I don't care if you are indie developers, if you can't make a decent game I'm going with a big cash-cow company that can. Heck, I'd rather play Kim Kardashian's game, at least it works and is up-front about wanting your money for nothing.			"

								SNOW is a BEAUTIFUL Skiing game where you ski around a mountain. It may encounter a few glitches BUT it is in an early state so all will (Hopefully) be fixed. The multiplayer is fun to ski with friends, and just playing alone is lovely. There are even events to challenge your skiing skills! I reccomend this to purchase access into this Closed State or you could wait as it will be F2P!			"

								Don't buy ""EARLY ACCESS"" games on Steam.I bought this game on 11 Oct 2013(Release Date of SNOW).When I bought it, I expected game play experience like the trailer.But when I played SNOW it was hard to control my characterbecause handling experience was a bull sh!t and there was lots of bugs, glitches.I couldn't complete any levels/slopes in this f.ucking game.I know this is an ""EARLY ACCESS"" game.I think the developers are very lazy because they're still making money.But there's no updates for bug fix, no updates for an improved handling experience even though released it 3 months ago.There's still no deadline to the official release date, and I don't know when can I play the full game.I'll never buy ""EARLY ACCESS"" games again. :(스팀 ""얼리 액세스"" 게임, 사지마세요.이 게임을 2013년 10월 11일(출시일)에 샀는데요.구입하기 전에는 트레일러 영상에 나온 정도를 기대했습니다만.정작 플레이 할 때는 캐릭터를 조작하기조차도 힘들었어요.조작감은 개♥♥♥ 같았고 버그도 정말 많았어요.단 하나의 레벨도 제대로 끝낼 수 없었고요.물론 저는 이게 ""얼리 액세스"" 게임이라는 것을 압니다만.저는 이 게임의 개발자들이 매우 게으르다고 생각해요, 그들은 여전히 돈을 벌고 있지만,게임이 나온지 3개월이 지났지만 아직까지 버그 수정과 조작감 향상 등을 위한 업데이트는 없었습니다.공식 출시일까지의 마감일 같은 것도 없고, 제대로 된 게임을 언제 즐길 수 있을지도 알 수 없습니다.저 개인적으로는 ""얼리 액세스"" 게임을 다시 구입하는 일은 절대 없을 겁니다. :(			"

								Awfully Buggy, no physics or momentum, the amount of times i have almost grinded upside down is unreal, while dying from a crash with a chair at an almost stationary speed. Constantly T-Posing and getting stuck. The UI is painful and the resolution meeses up my screen, so no mouse use is possible, making a controller vital, but the controls aren't very good as it is. You cannot pause on the controller or launch drones. This game may have potential, but at the moment i feel cheated from a f2p game, i want a refund of my time. Oh, and the game crashes if you try to quit, requiring a full shut down and reboot :(			"

								I haven't played Steep, which is what everyone is inevitably comparing this game to. So with no comparisons in mind here we go:The game looks fine. Nothing spectactular. Some of the biggest disappointments: The entire lack of physics with the snow. As far as it looks you may as well be riding on concrete because the snow is just static terrain, no deformation, the snowboards/skis also frequently clip through the ground while playing.Sound seemed awful to me. Can't hear anything but a wind noise. Is this largely what you'd here while skiing/snowboarding? Maybe, but it doesn't make for a pleasant gameplay experience.The worst of it all? The game played like a clunky mess. Movement was sluggish and felt extremely rigid. I'm not even talking about tricks here, just riding around. I'd wager a lot of the clunky feeling comes from a serious lack of animation in the characters body...but the sluggishness of it all. I feel like I'm going down the mountain in slow motion most of the time. Speed is only apparent when you are weaving in close quarters between rocks, and then when you hit a rock the games wacky physics shows itself. Crashed? Can't get back up and continue. Gotta reset the whole course or use a DiRT esque rewind system. No idea how the free roam is really supposed to work. Couldn't find a way up to peaks and what not without teleporting there. But you have to ride locations to unlock the teleport to them...and none of this covered. Perhaps you can't get up the mountains without buying the snowmobile in the store?Either way, would not recommend. Gameplay did not feel smooth at any point. It was just a clunky, sluggish mess.			"

								So far so good, i really like the open world and the way it's composed. You have classic skiing routes, you can go skiing in the forest, on the frozen water(it's a bit buggy but whatever) and the game lets you do whatever you want. I kinda miss SNB at this point, but the devs promised to add them later on(when skiing is finished) so i keep playing.Main pros:+Beautiful world+Nice panoramas, especially in the morning+The feeling you get from the ride is great+Lots of customization(although paid)Main cons:-So far pretty badly optimized(even though my laptop isn't the greatest, i'd say i should be able to run this better than 30fps lowest settings)-Riding on the frozen lake feels weird-There are parts of the world that feel somehow empty(i guess devs will fix that later on)-Please, devs, if you read this, add some kind of contrast between the snow ,dunes' in bright sun, it's weird to see just white on the bottom half of your screenAll in all, a cool experience, you will like this if you liked SSX.

								This is the absolutely most beautiful implementation for the Cryengine 3 I've seen  yet. Maybe because I like winter. Honestly the only thing I can't decide to do is either use Oculus Rift (SDK 1 for now, soon SDK 2 OLED) use 60in Plasma (The colors man the colors) 27in 1440p (1440p should be the standard). I would mention 3840x2160 but the only 4k HDTV I have can't run 60hz.Seriously this like Eurotruck is one of those games you spend 20 minutes looking around at the start. Now the real question I wonder is when this game is done, how will the mods be? The world is huge, graphics beautiful, zero lag since devs are beasts but also because Cryengine 3 is so stable.

								My name was Jim, I loved to ski. I'd grind at night, I'd flip at dips, I'd fight the night. All for my board. But one day, I was grilling a sick mama jama sandwhich of a combo, when it hit me... The ultimate gnar.You may be thinking- a Gnar? That's like getting hit by a tricycle, no, this wicked sick twist left both my ankles severed and launched me into the sunset. I could only pray as I watched my body crumple up and vibrate against a terrifying dark backdrop. I gazed hoplessly at the sun, begging for death, but it just let me dissipate into a valley of darkness...Then I went home and played snow, feel better now!			"

								This is the absolutely most beautiful implementation for the Cryengine 3 I've seen  yet. Maybe because I like winter. Honestly the only thing I can't decide to do is either use Oculus Rift (SDK 1 for now, soon SDK 2 OLED) use 60in Plasma (The colors man the colors) 27in 1440p (1440p should be the standard). I would mention 3840x2160 but the only 4k HDTV I have can't run 60hz.Seriously this like Eurotruck is one of those games you spend 20 minutes looking around at the start. Now the real question I wonder is when this game is done, how will the mods be? The world is huge, graphics beautiful, zero lag since devs are beasts but also because Cryengine 3 is so stable. Lots of oppurtunities.			"

								Now I completely understand the games current status, it's in ""early access"" and is still subject to multiple changes throughout its development. The only thing I have an issue about is spawning in this game.My level is 33, I am more experienced, therefore I play harder mountains. If I go down let's say, ""Giant's Eye"", I would have 11 other people spawn on me since most of the server itself is filled with inexperienced players than myself. Also selected a drop point is kind of buggy since when you do so you are still active in-game, if you crash while in the drop selection, you'll get canceled out of the menu and back to respawn screen.This is really my own pet peeve, and I really hope this itself gets fixed, otherwise this game is really nice and I would fully recommend it.

								Awesome game considering it is in alpha state. No sound but it hardly subtracts from the fun you can have by skiing down mountains on and off piste. There are plenty of spawn points to choose from depending on what you feel like doing.You can just take a relaxing ski, perform tricks or just go super fast to then perform a huge air at the end. I would certainly recommend for people to buy the game now in order to support the development team in finishing this amazing game.Check out a full review here: http://consolesandkeyboards.wordpress.com/2014/02/10/snow-pc-preview/ "

								Great next gen skiing game. Poppermost nailed the extreme sports skiing/snowboarding game. Controls are easy to pick up. The menus are easy to navigate. Online play is (mostly bugless) very fun. Lots of customization options for you character. Leveling up happens through saving trick points which you get by performing tricks. And the graphics are above average in my opinion. It's still in beta so the final game is still being made meaning the game is constantly changing and getting better. The small community is great. And i can't wait to see where this game will go. Screw you Steep for taking Poppermost's ideas. If you love outdoor winter sports or just want to try this game out please do. You won't regret it. By the way it's also FREE! What do you have to lose?			"

It's pretty much going to be a PC version of SSX when it's complete, but at the moment it's more of a tech demo. A VERY BUGGY, BROKEN TECH DEMO. THAT BEING SAID, the feel and visuals are awesome. Skiing down the gigantic mountains and doing flips in the first person mode is way too much fun. I feel like it's going to be really good when it's complete, and the updates have been decently frequent, so I'd definitely keep it on your radar. If this turns out to be another Cash-grab and run on an early access game, I'll be super sad. But IF THEY DELIVER I will be a super happy individual.			"

								Alright, this game is getting some backlash for microtransactions. Whatever, it's buying Cosmetics, and I don't see you screaming at Valve about keys and crates.Now this game has pros and cons like any otherMultiplayer is currently disabled. It is April 15th 2015 at the time of this Review, so that might change by the time you read this. Much like everything else in this review.It's ragdolls are pretty good, however sometimes you get stuck through nets or your head rolls around like an owl turning it at mach 2.The Terrain is b-e-a-utiful. The snow isn't just some all white texture on the ground. It seems like it in the sunlight for the most part, but you see some shiny specks here and there, but when you remove sunlight, say you get under a tree , you see the discrepancies in the snow, which are done perfectly. You also leave a trail in the snow, and it looks like flattened down snow, not just parted snow. The lakes and rivers are all frozen over and you can ski on them, but if you fall from serious height onto it you eat it, so I'll allow it.One thing this game gives you is some serious fall height. It's pretty fun, and I've seen some crazy drops in the X-Games and things like that, but I just don't know. Maybe someone with some actual skiing experience can elaborate on that one.The soundtrack is pretty good. Im personally not a fan of that kind of music, but it's like a kind of trance music, I guess? It's really soothing, and fits the game perfectly, so you're immersed immediately, even if you don't like it.  It also tells you the song name when it changes.All in all, I only have three issues with the game. The standing animation (When you aren't moving) is a bit, I don't know, stiff? It doesn't seem life-like. It seems a bit rushed, I mean, if I moved my body like that to stretch I think I'd pull something. Perhaps it should be a bit slower, smoother and more natural. It's unnatural.Issue Three is that when you go into an area, it says @ui_AreaName. Once that gets changed to just AreaName popping up on the screen it will blend perfectly.My third issue is that the game doesn't save my sound settings. I turn the music off to talk to my friends or so I can listen to different music while I play, and every time I quit and come back, the music is back on. However, when I go into the settings, the slider is still set to off.Now for my wishes and wants, these are things the game lacks, but I don't really see them as issues. I can live without them.I wish it had some AI going around to fill the world a bit, and shops and such in the actual world to make use of the buildings you've made. I wouldn't mind some dismounted mode either, where you can just walk around. It can be a pain to try to find a spot you want to drop in from if you ski uphill from your starting point. I wish the ski lifts would actually let you hop on and ride them.Outside of that, this game is looking very good, and with more improvements you're looking at what could set some future standards.

								Like any game there's the good and the bad.Good:- Latest CryEngine with controllable time-of-day looks great, lots of graphical options- Game controls are tight and responsive, it feels similar to the Skate series- Realistic about 95% of the time- Main mountain (Sialia) is absolutely massive- Soundtrack is nice and chill- Real sound samples from people skiing- Replay is available, with nice camera controls- Rewind allows you to _not_ ragdoll into the great beyond if you bounce off a boulder- Ragdoll is hilarious in the event that you do bounce off a boulder- Microtransactions are for cosmetic items only at this pointBad:- Requires DX11, can be a deal-breaker for some people I guess- Physics needs a bit more work, that being said the fails are funny so you don't really care- Buttering isn't exactly realistic which makes it hard to predict where you'll go if you butter off something (maybe I just need to git gud)- No way to earn credits to unlock cosmetic items (yet)With that out of the way, I'd recommend it to anyone who likes skiing or enjoyed Skate 3. It's a bit more realistic than SSX (somewhat like Skate 3 vs Tony Hawk games) so don't expect an SSX clone.In general lots of fun, open-world exploration, and stylish tricks for days.			"

								SNOW is a beautiful new look the the winter sports game genre. It entered a market that's pretty much been dominated by EA, but was able to develope a game that's more enjoyable. The character customization is some of the best I've seen in a sports simulator. I believe the game will really take off once it begins the multiplayer addition. It's very clean cut and not overcrowded by XP, etc. Currently, the game is playable but just basically the overall structure. I'd say it's worth following it up as it's developed.Also, here is a quick first look video:

								Paid early access. Enjoying the updates and newer gameplay (though I seem to be alone on that front), and with baited breath for snowboards.A little disturbed to find the slew of reviews all highlighting a common theme - those of us who paid to support the game in its early stages are now being penalised due to a change in business model of rmicrotransactions none the less.Whilst changing to a F2P model makes some sense long term, especially with brands on board and a monetisation model that works there too - Its shooting a niche fanbase in the face if you strip it all away and charge again - the game isn't even nearly complete enough to pull that kind of stunt - and you don't have nearly big enough of a fanbase to play the numbers game.Anyway - this is something that can easily be fixed so I don't see why it should be too huge an issue.Good work so far guys, and thanks for having the vision to create a game that replicates what we love - not some SSX bulls**t. SNOWBOARDS PLEAAASSEEEE. "

								I thought it was a fun-ish game. If the devs do read this, PLEASE, for your own good, add a ragdoll effect for when you crash, like you might fly off your skies or something and break bones like in Skate3 or something. It would bring the game to a much higher level of popularity as it could not only be a sports game, but a humorous game!!! Also, make it so players can at least change the colors of their clothes or make their character look different.			"

								A true marvel for today's gaming industry. Absolutely astonishing costumization and an outstanding physics system. It's also important to add that this world that is SNOW is massive, a lot of games struggle to compare to this. The hidden lore in the castle, the helicopters and the broken plane crash make SNOW feel like real life. This makes SNOW the greatest open world sports game ever created.			"

								This game is legendary, and as a real skier (I ski 60+ days every season) , is pretty damn realistic. Sure people complain about the way the snow looks and stuff, but its amazing. This game is legendary as a ski simulator but is also amazingly fun. Props to Poppermost Productions. Oh, and comparing it to steep, is the $60 gap worth it? Absolutely f#cking not. This game is very good, and considering it will actually get updates (for a long time likely, its poppermosts' only project) it will in the end be better than steep. Try it. It's free. Nothing to lose. PROS:SnowSkiingSnowboardingFreeSmall file (3 gb)Great graphicsRealisticFunCons:Quite heavy of a game, doesn't run well (or even launch) on some bad potatoes. Im sorry if it doesn't play well (or play at all).Oh, and when the ps4 version releases free to play, GET IT. I have the beta on PS4, it is amazing. I'd say its similar to High settings on PC, and it runs easily 60fps. The $20 isn't worth the price gap though. Until it's free on PS4, stick to PC. When it's free on PS4, don't even think twice about it.NOTE:I actually have played 200ish hours, just most of it has been on PS4, so it is not logged on steam. I have a macbook pro dualbooting windows, and switching over to windows is such a pain I never play on steam often.			"

								Marginally recommended.only because it's free. It's fairly good relaxed fun for the most part with good performance and acceptable graphics on the cryengine.There is quite a range of bling to have and so far I'm liking the free roam multiplayer without competition, pretty chill. But after a few dozen hours gets pretty boring. Some more objectives, races/competitions, sht like that would be nice. I guess you can get that out of the xgames packs or something I haven't looked into it, but requires money/credits afaik and single player only.Graphics wise, the rocks do look a bit generic and the snow itself is decent, however there are snow ramps/banks that look very gawdy. Especially when you try to ramp off of them but die because there's no graduation of slope onto them, they're just like concrete blisters. Also there is no deformation of the snow except shallow tracks, all of it is as if it's all hard packed, no poofy drifts to sink in. It seems there's 3 or 4 different snow surfaces, the raked trails which feel fast but hard, the slightly thicker snow which is slower and softer, and some icy/slushy areas....but nothing thick to throw powder with. But all of that is far beyond the point of the maps being a bit unfinished as it is. The snowmobile is OK, sure could use some moving parts and turning handlebar.Multiplayer, works fairly well (pretty terrible lately, servers are either bogged down with memory leaks and making the speed slow or the admins are putting every server on slow speed making everything look like an instant replay indefinitely...may be relaxing and easy for tricks but is rather tiresome rather quickly, the server browser is crap,  doesn't sort or report correct player counts and some servers simply don't connect at all) and is quite satisfying to have almost all of the players on the server spawn off of you as you all go off the same ramp doing various tricks simultaneously. mostly though you'll see your peers jerking back and forth a lot/hopping up and down (not sure if that's a button or just a weird effect on multiplayer) from the packet reliability going up and down as to be expected when going high speeds. Though there are a lot of times everything goes really slow all of a sudden then speeds up.  Horrible chat interface. warping around, lagging out, dying on spawn, hitting things way outside their visible boundaries, no wipeouts/crashes just immediate death, etc. lot's of work to do on this before i spend any money on bling. and it has been in early access since 2013...i smell some part time devs who gave up.

								A fun and relaxing gameSnow is great in the aspect that it fills a hole where few games exist for PC, and it does so with both Skiing and Snowboarding. The controls take time to get used to, but it does support controller input. You can change the keyboard layout, but sadly you can't change the controller layout and that's a big downside. Took me ages to get used to duck and jump being switched for my liking (xbox controller).That said. The game has a few bugs, but considering that it's free - they're acceptable. You sometimes get stuck in places but other times you land jumps that shouldn't be possible. So the bugs can work in your favour too. There is plenty of content, but most of it has to be bought for real money. You can gain credits to purchase events ingame, but it takes a long time and it'll never be enough for everything.However, you don't need to purchase anything in order to get all the Steam Archievements as in other free-to-play games. While it takes time, it is a game that is 100% completable for free.So in short, if you like snow sport and miss such a game on the PC - add it to your Steam Library. After all, for free there's nothing to lose.			"

								In it's earlier state this bothered me,Bad controls, physics and glitches.Not to mention they completely screwed over the people who bought it in early access by making it f2p and adding microtransactions to buy things that were originally available to equip for free.Now they added a ton more stuff (snowboarding, snowmobiling) and fixed A LOT of the old issues, this game now feels properly polished and is alot of fun to play. You just grab your skis and do what you want, it might not have any clear objectives but it's not forcing you around to do stupid stuff (looking at you Steep).This game is a must have, It's free and provides much better gameplay then Ubisoft's new Steep (which costs 60$ and probably more with DLC).

								SNOW is one of the best free-to-play free roam style games I have ever played.  Everytime I get back on the game it feels like a new experience for me.  The calm open world is fun to explore and the vast amount of drop points makes the game feel diverse.  Overall SNOW is one of my favorite free-to-play games and I would recommend it for anyone wanting a realistic snow sport game or just a relaxing game to pass time.			"

								I recommend the game its free so I wont complain about price, but SNOW is in desperate need of some minor tweaks in order to become better. -More speed, too many times im frustrated by pressing X in order to hump myself forwards. This only helps a little bit and the speed itself is realistic once you go downwards, but I feel it go even faster be leaning forward or something. (I know its not meant to be an arcade game but just a little bit more would have been great..)-Rewarding system? You can level up as much as you want but it doesent give you anything else than numbers. What about character attributes? you can spend certain points on going faster, agility, tricks etc. Or buy a funny snowboard that does some crazy stuff? I mean cmon I know its not meant to be SSX or anything, but people play and they play to progress in games, you dont get rewards, you dont progress, you dont wanna play. Just saying.But anyways this game is so well made to this very date, that I still recommend checking it out. But SNOW is far from finished, it needs a lot more functions.			"

								FREESKIER OF 15 YEARS HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THIS GAME SUCKS.I purchased it during its alpha phase because I was so excited a freeskiing game was coming to market.Novelty wore off fast. Let me tell you, the physics in this game feel terrible. Shredsauce, a unity engine browser game made in the freetime by a Newschoolers moderator, feels more like skiing than this garbage. Multiplayer barely works. Game is cluttered with microtransactions. Feels nothing like skiing. Clunky controls. Your player will spontaneously combust and disintegrate because you landed a trick perfectly, but for some reason your feet go through the snow, then you ride for 10 feet under the snow before exploding. Do yourself a favor and just go play Shredsauce or maybe wait until Steep comes out. Pce.			"

								Snow is possibly one of the greatest survival horror games out there right now. You play as a namless cacasian man trapped inside his own personal hell with his dopple gangers as he is loosing his sanity. The game taunts you with steep hills that take several minutes to climb and buildings that give the illusion of food and shelter. In the end there is only snow, no one else besides yourself, and if you escape the mountains surrounding your hell you are only greated with an endless drop down.			"

At the moment it's buggy and multiplayer is just free ride (lots more to do single player) but it's free so if you like extreme sports games you'll get a few hours of fun out of it, just don't expect it to be that one snowsport game you're looking for because right now it isn't - there's too much wrong with it right now.Only reason I reccomend is because it's free, if it was still £10 I'd say wait.

Early Access Review
								Short summary: Very good atmosphere, arcadey, solid and frequent updates, still very much in Early Acces!Snow filled the itch that was left after not skiing this year. It get's the atmosphere of skiing in the mountains just right. It's not really realistic in terms of physics, but it is in terms of tricks. This means that jumps are a little higher than realisticly possible and that the physics engine sometimes flips out. In terms of tricks, you can't do any SSX monstertrick stuff. It's pretty cool and satifactory if you land your first double backflip with a simple grab. The environment is amazing! The mountain is well designed with cool hidden places. It allows you to explore a realistic environment. I'm checking this game for an hour or so every few weeks to check out what they changed.Pros:+ Atmosphere+ Environment+ Frequent and elaborate updates+ Realistic in terms of tricks and skiing area+ Sleek design+ Very fun in multiplayer! (the only way to play IMO)+ Calming and relaxing to playCons:- Buggy, it's definetely in alpha- Skiing animation and physics not super realistic and 1:1- Limiting in terms of (extreme) tricks- Wonky physics engine- They got rid of the crazy ragdoll (temporary, I think)- Small servers for multiplayer- Not enough player-player interaction (yet) in multiplayer "

								Even though this game is still early access it is a great game. I started playing this game because a friend of me told me it was a really fun game. After I spent over an hour to complete the tutorial (I know I suck) I started playing online with my friend.First of all I need to see that the map is very very very big. It has some really nice views. When you are just a beginner you start playing on courses on the buttom of the mountains. When you gain enough XP you are able to select a different drop point. If you do have enough XP you can start completly at the top.Eventhough I sucked at the tutorial I did manage to stay alive for quitte a while on the server. The amount of people is limited to 12 (Not that much for such a big map) but everyone who playes it is really nice. I asked some really noob questions and the answered me like it was normal. After a few more hours playing with my friend I started to be good at it. I even managed to stay alive even longer than him :D. Skiing is not that hard anymore when you play for a little while on a server or offline.If you do manage to stay alive you can do tricks and all kinds of cool stuff. Even though the game is early access it does not have mayor bugs. My experience was just a little glitch were I could get out of the map, nothing more.I really do recommend this game not only for skiing but also for the nice gameplay online. People get curious if you join a server and before you know you are surrounded by other people. Really nice :)And before I forget I heard they were busy with adding snowboarding as well :D			"

								SNOW is a fun casual game. From the looks of it, multiplayer is pretty bad, but nobody I know owns the game, so I don't even try playing online. I can't really say too much about SNOW, since I am limited with the keyboard and mouse. Without a controller, you're limited. You can only do flips, and spins, nothing more. The game is still kinda fun.   Buggy, but fun. I spent an hour or so in single player. Putting it down for now.Is it worth $10? Well, that's for you to decide.Don't want to spend money? Well signing up for the beta is an option. It only took me 2 days to get a key. Plus, the game is going F2P soon, so theres that.			"

And I am very VERY grateful for my friend for saving me £40 for a game which is technically the same, but free. It is extremely addictive and has breathtaking tricks and landscapes. I recommend this game A LOT, its beautiful, fun and endlessly exciting. It saves you from spending £40 on a game that is almost identical.10/10P.S Thanks to my man raidy for showing me the game.

								I have always been interested in snowboarding and open world games, Steep was one game I wanted. But one of my friends told me about SNOW, and after seeing it was Free To Play, I thought, why not? And I am very VERY grateful for my friend for saving me £40 for a game which is technically the same, but free. It is extremely addictive and has breathtaking tricks and landscapes. I recommend this game A LOT, its beautiful, fun and endlessly exciting. It saves you from spending £40 on a game that is almost identical.10/10P.S Thanks to my man raidy for showing me the game. Hes a pretty cool guy.			"

								It's fun for a while, but ultimately pointless. They need to add a story maybe, some kind of long term goal, at the moment you just ride or do events to gain XP which ultimately means nothing. Still, it is fun. Especially for free to play, its great compared to most free to play games. I wouldn't spend more than a few bucks on it unless they added more things to do though, and some sort of motivation to do those things.			"

								Really want to like this game, just can't get past the glaring flaws. I feel that it's way too early to ask people to pay for aesthetics in this game. The physics need work and I can't deal with my snowboard being inside of the ground while riding. Also not a fan of landing up to my knees in the ground and then falling for no reason. Very glitchy. Freezes constantly in singleplayer, requiring a full system restart. Doesn't reward you with in game currency for progress until you restart the game. Then, has the nerve to ask you to pay for any clothing, boards, ect through microtransactions. I'm not paying money for boards that are glitched out under the ground most of the time. Fix the core mechanics of the game before focusing on microtransactions for aesthetics. No one wants to pay for sunglasses for their character in a game they'll never play again because the only thing that works is paying for the sunglasses. Therefore, in its current state, I cannot recommend this game, although I hope this will change in the future.			"

When i play this game I feel like im at the mountain, it just gives me such a great experience and makes me feel like im actually there with these stunniong grapics. the only thing is is the coats are to big, i like when my coats are at my waist. It makes me feel more confident at the mountain. Also I dont like how the helmets cover up my forhead, i feel like my character would look cooler if i could show off my sexy tan acne filled forhead. But anyways its probably a 6/9. I definitely suggest getting this game.			"

								This game isin't bad, but there are some things which I got issues with well lets start from good things first. For F2P freeroaming downhill ski game, to chill a bit it does job relatively well! As you might suspect clothing and equipment is hard to comeby, and you can obtain alot by paying for geting ingame credits, should you do that? Well thats up to you. You can obtain exacly 625 credits after reaching max level (which is lv.60) If you're patient enough, you can spend few hours doing spins on ice jumping in place like derp, and you can hit lv 40-45 easely later on its harder obviously, but i think lv.60 requires around 400-500k points total. But if you want buy some clothes, well thats one way to do it fastest f2p way. (for some reason achivment for reaching lv60 didint kick in on my steam profile yet, hope it will later.)The controls can be bit wonky, and tutorial where you need to do advenced grab 720* spin is pain, found my friends have huge problem with that part, i did it just becouse i was lucky after many tries, so i suggest skip tutorial and check controls to learn keys.Didint had anny issues playing game in single player mode, however it has to be said that multiplayer got own problems.We tried with friends get to same server, and with limit to 12 ppl per server it can take while. And if we finaly menage to get into same server, we all get crashes at same time at some point after playing 20-30 min, so i assume the problem is with servers itself.  I think easy solution for that might be to be able host own private sessions, and i hope developers add such option in future.We had good laughts after dying on spot, litelary dying and turning into gravestone and as fun as it is - its still glitchy to die on spot like that upon touching a stone gentle, or each other, definitly being able going through each other might be nice idea, also having ragdoll (Becouse in SP ragdoll works) would be more convinient, i hope this be changed in future too and its just temporary solution.Beside multiplayer crashes - for me - game works fine, friends also said its well optimized so might run on slower computers. It needs work, and i hope developers will work on it becouse potential for fun multiplayer game is there.			"

								I hardly got a gold medal in a challenge, and it said ""Loading Reward"" and it went on forever, didn't give me the reward, so I had to ALT+F4. Best game ever 10/10. Seriously, the concept is good, but the game has shxt loads of bugs in it.Also, as a free to play game, you may guess the market system: Everything is fxxking expensive. You can earn a little amounts of coins through leveling up, but that won't help you customize your character however you want it. You'll have to buy in-game money using real money. I don't know, people. If you're cool with that kind of microtransaction/coin system, and like skiing, snowboarding, you'll like the game.			"

								One of the most refreshing F2P titles ever, SNOW is a Free-to-Play snowboarding/skiing game in which you can participate in solo challenges/free rides to accumulate points while enjoying the physics of the game, or you can join 11 other players on a big mountain (Siala) and simply ride around like you would on a real ski trip.The game uses microtransactions in an acceptable way, mainly selling cosmetic items and extra events, though there is also a snomobile to be unlocked through the cash shop. The game also plays alot better with a controller, even though you can have tons of fun just playing on the keyboard. My only major gripe is the many crashed that can occur, making you lose your points, atleast in the multiplayer part of the game.The mechanics are pretty good for a f2p and the landscape is simply amazing, from castles, to huge statues, to plain ski resorts and even a sunken village! The animation isnt the best out there, but for what it is, it's entirely acceptable. There is also a library of copyright free music that is quite relaxing, and you can modify your clothing to resemble popular skiers or snowboarders, such as Candide Thovex.Overall, this game is certainly worth a try, especially considering its free. Bring a friend or two.			"

								Snow is probably one of my favorite games. It has a beuatiful open world with tons of rails jumps castles buildings and more to shred. They even have mini mountains like S-Games (Xgames) and more events. What I like is how you can customize your character to fit your style. From powder to park there's tons of merchndise. Another thing thats great is that you can ski, snowboard, and snowmobile. (a snowmobile is rather expnsive in-game) Overall this is a great game if you like to ski or snowboard. It even helped me learn new tricks irl.			"

								Second best snowboarding game I've played behind the king, SSX 3.  Snow plays more like Skate- it's physics based, the controls are intuitive, and while pretty rough around the edges at presentl, if you want a snowboard sim, this would be the one to go with.			"

								it's good but it could have a difficult mode like skate 3 have. Easy: Easy to get speed and don't bail quicly and easy tricks Normal: Bail easyer than easy and does not speed as quicly as easy does. Hard: Bail easyer than normal and speed takes time and paiticent and the tricks needs to be good or else you could bail hard But other than that i think it's the game everyone has been waiting for and specially pc gamers.

								I bought this two years ago and they seemed to be making slow but, steady progress. I see that two years of work went into the micro transaction store.Biggest issues--Never can get enough speed, like skiing in vaseline.-Too many bugs-Grinding doesn't work-Character has no weight-I paid for the game before they changed to the F2P model.If you really can't wait for a snowboarding or skiing game go pickup ssx on ps2 or if you trust ubisoft you could try steep.

								Let me just say that even though this game is in early access, im already addicted to it. I have had this game for about 1 year now and i've enjoyed every minute of it. There are so many great things about this game, for example the music is awesome and I love listening to it, the graphics are amazing for an early access game in my opinion and the main mountain is huge and there is so much to explore. I hope they add multiplayer really soon because a few of my friends have this game and im dying to play with them. The only cons of this game that i found were that now you have to pay real money to customize your character (unlike the good old days where everything was free) and the fact that the game is still buggy (but dont let this discourage you from buying the game because its still early access and its expected). Overall, at the moment I think this game is worth buying because the bugs make it hilarious and its so open world and nice to look at that even just going down a mountain casually is loads of fun. Dont think that this game is a waste of money because its buggy since it is in early access and thats expected (like i said before). If you arent sure about buying this game then i think you should wait for them to add more things (like multiplayer) and fix the mechanics or just wait for the game to officially release and become free to play.

								I did a full on video review and gameplay but the footage was lost. Heres my typed review anywayPros:Free to playIs only in early access so can get betterFair amount of gamemodesCons:Problem with buying things, tried to buy a mask and it took my money yet didn't have it in my inventoryYou don't really go through the snow, only just glide apon it like its concrete, no dentDoesn't tell you all the tricks you can do, so I looked silly in the ones where u have to get as many points as you can even tho i tried all the tricks I could.Get ""Bad landing"" a lot even though you landed pretty wellBit of a pay to get more stuff game, but I guess thats what you get with free to playsWind sound just takes up the whole entire game noise, its annoying as♥♥♥♥♥♥and not pleasingMusic is meh Okay a BIG con here. DOES NOT, I repeat, DOES NOT support fullscreen! The graphics look ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as ♥♥♥♥ if you play it fullscreen. But I still played it 1920x1080. It looks worse then if u played it small and windowed. They need to fix this ASAP This was pretty covered but graphics arent the bestPhysics are pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥ and you cant replay your death or crash which is sad :( can't see you get sort of rekt.You don't really crash, just sort of hit it then flopYou don't see your helicopter AT ALL when you go for it, you don't get to go in the ski lift you just teleport.... I would love to see the aesthetics and stuff and it'd be cool to go on the chopper and ski lift, and you could skip if you'd like And what the hell is with white on white stuff?[/b] Like when you finish an event or Freerun its got white text over a white screen so you can't even see it? Fix this... Can't see (i guess its like white on white too) you filling up the bar for ""going to a ski lift"" or ""end run"" and etc. If you are holding down Y to finish a run and etc but accidently drift like a cm away it just cancels it...Would I recommend this game? Maybe. Its only in early access and has a lot of potentialIf you love ski and snowboard games so much and you play them regularly? Get Steep insteadIf you only sort of like them or play them sometimes/rarely? Get this game I guessIf you're rich and don't care either way? Get steep lmaoIf you want a Free to play game thats fun for a little bit and hopefully could get better? Get this gameAt this point, if this game cost $20 or more, I would still get steep, but since it is free to play I guess we'll see what happens.I hope the devs read this. Thankyou :).~Too bad my footage was lost, had some other points I forgot~			"

								Just 20 minutes into my escapade into SNOW, my character went into Starfish mode. Nothing I did could coax him back into the world of animation. I have barely played this game, and I'm already tired of it. The controls simply feel weird, and this is coming from someone who who finished Steep in its entirety.If you want a quality Winter Sports game and don't mind a price tag, I would recommend Steep. Larger map, and finished animations and controls. Plus the Alaska DLC is free. I'll see you there.			"

								2015: I've seen this game rise from the ashes. From being something where I was like ' This might be cool' to now, where I'm like 'This is so freaking cool'. I don't think words can do this game justice. As a snowboarder I am in love with mountains and the aspect of being able to ride across it, sadly I can't snowboard all the time. This game more/less makes up for that. With amazing graphics and beautiful sounds the team behind this has created what can only be described as a masterpeice.2014 :This is a real snowboarding/skiing free-roam game, worthy of the title SNOW. Graphically stunning visuals make it a must play. SNOW in my opinion is up there with 1080 degrees, for the environment that is there and the amount of customisation. The developers are also very public - anwsering questions and relaying news on the latest update.SNOW is shaping up to be a real 'must have' for skiiers or snowboarders. When the work has finally finished it will have the biggest mountain ever created to ski/board on, multiplayer, events, ski lifts, custom spawn points, replay system, halfpipe, trick parks, collectibles, and those are just the confirmed bits. All of it can be viewed here: http://snowthegame.com/2013/10/21/early-access-feedback/I really think this is worth getting - I've spent 78 hours ingame up to the 19th of May 2014, this is most likely going to increase by a long way over the upcoming years.10/10			"

								I heard about this game back in early 2014. I had a couple of friends who told me that I shouldn't dive head first into an ever-progressing early access ski simulator. I believe that I have around 10+ hours already, which I know doesn't seem like a lot, but that's quite a few trips down the slopes in this beautiful game. I also tested some of the boundaries, and I was impressed that there are a plethora of ways to go down the mountain in every location. Brilliant game and I look forward to its future.			"

								You can not go wrong with this game. Download it, pick up your controller and start shredding immediately! I have 80+ hours in game and it's still fun every time I play it.Don't listen to the negative reviews. Wow. Some of these reviews are REALLY pointless and harsh. Dudes, chill out. This game is AMAZINGLY FUN! Not only do you get to SHRED the hell out of steeps and deeps, but you get to hit up a TON of parks. The parks have rails (mind you they aren't quite perfect yet), Super Pipes and Slopestyle courses. Not only that, but you can find some sick natural rails and giant hits throughout the mountain.The devs are constantly updating the game and making it better. That is worth your $$. Oh wait, it's also FREEEEE!!!!!  So you don't have to spend any $$ on it. You can just hop into the game and shred.			"

								The fact that I spent probably 2 hours of my time glitching around (and somehow losing all momentum up a 2 foot slope every 5 seconds) just to level up 10 times to get approx the amount of credits to buy the toe portion of some crappy boots shows how money hungry these guys are. There's no character customization when you start either, you basically HAVE to spend money just to look less like an absolute pleb. So yeah, if you don't care for good gameplay, have way too much time on your hands and little will to live, then you'll have a blast with this ""FREE"" game. Oh and you can't play all of the events for free either :DDDD			"

								This game is a very intense action/rpg game starring Tom Cruise as an undercover agent on a mission to escape the game. I would rate the game a hefty Gammon out of Bacon. The game can be broken and the map can be escaped which gives you infinate points if you spin and you can get infinate coins to spend on the shop. Also because of this descovery, if you hit the thumbs up there is a 1 in 10 chance of making the thumbs up turn gold, this will give you a free steam key for the top game on your wishlist.			"

								I had high hopes for SNOW, as I absolutely love anything to do with such. However, this is a very disappointing game, even for one in Alpha. The controls are sh*te. It is near impossible to get any sense of speed. However that is a good thing, as when you do finally get some speed up, I dare you to keep it that way for more than a few seconds. There is no sound, and barely any visuals settings, even though they are the only options you can tweak at the minute. Even if there were any visuals options, they wouldn't change jack-sh*t, as the game is fairly... Ugly. It can look very nice, with some beautifully rendered trees and rocks, however the snow and the surroundings (Mostly snow) look horrendous. It astonishes me that something this poorly put together is on Steam. This is not an Alpha, this is someone barely putting together an engine for a game and releasing it. Give it a year and it might be playable, but for now I don't recommend picking this up even slightly. "

								Basically, pay to test a ""free-to-play"" game... mostly nothing works on this game as of now. The graphics are nowhere remotely near the 'screenshots' shown and even the video seems misleading. SNOW doesn't have much to keep you playing as there is nothing whatsoever to ""draw you in"". After a bit of research, I was pretty much bummed to see this...""Going free to play"" bit in the description.So I've paid to beta-test this unfinished product which will eventually be a F2P game? Right... don't buy this game!PROS:+Decent visuals of the mountain (hence the CryEngine!).CONS:-Visual artifacts on all graphical settings; from low to very high.-Screen tearing on all graphical settings.-NO SOUND/MUSIC.-Poor animationOVERALL:Granted this is a ""EARLY ACCESS"" game but even at of this state, the game is in poor quality. Maybe the end result could be worth it, but, I do feel a bit ripped off by buying this game, especially paying to beta test a Free to Play game.RATING:Pending... since it's early access...BEST RECOMMENDATION:Wait until the game is either more finished or released as it's alledged FREE TO PLAY status. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME NOW! Don't make my mistake of paying to test this.			"

Early Access Review
								SNOW is a glitchy mess. When the game works, it's slow. You never get that sense of speed that you'll get in other games. Even 1080 Snowboarding on the Nintendo 64 had better speed and less glitchy mechanics. What you see in the trailers is not what you will get in game. Are you interested in snowmobiles? Too bad, you have to buy the snowmobile mode with in-game currency bought with real world money. If you enter a multiplayer server, you'll notice that all players look the same because no one cares enough to spend real world money on cosmetics. If you're willing to spend any amount of money on this game for any reason, you'd be better off just buying a better game like Steep where the world is larger, the graphics are better, the mechanics work, and everyone looks different. The lack of identity and the glitches in SNOW hurt the game, but it is an early access game so you can't judge them for that. Except you should judge them for that because of one key fundamentally wrong thing they do. SNOW is an early access game with paid DLC. If the game is unfinished, why would anyone pay extra for more pieces of the game that don't finish anything? Why not just wait until it's complete? If a big company like EA tried this, everyone would rip them to shreds. DLC in early access games should be called patches and updates, not DLC! This company doesn't want to finish this game. The game looks the same as it did when they first opened it to early access in 2013.There is one thing that makes SNOW work. One and only one thing that the game has over other games in this genre. The map design. The world is fun to explore. The ski resort like slopes feel real, and the off trail slopes are exciting (even though the speed is slow). The inclusion of real world event locations makes the game even more interesting for anyone like myself who keeps up with events like the X-Games. Except SNOW ruins it again! To play on some of the mountains they have built, you have to pay again. Even though this isn't a finished product, they sure like to charge for it. Microtransaction after microtransaction. For the ""full"" unfinished experience, you can pay upwards of $100 for the game. They have a $100 option for buying their special coins.This game's ""early access"" title is just a crutch. A lame excuse so that when someone says the game looks terrible, they can respond with ""it's early access and still in development."" Then everyone playing who likes it will say ""wow, this game sure is alright for an early access game. When it finally releases, I bet it'll be great!"" There are no plans to finish the game. This is a title that will sit in early access forever adding more paid dlc instead of real updates to the core game. Go buy Steep. At least then when they put in microtransaction and dlc, you know the core game is still fun and finished.			"

								Fun, very pretty and atomspheric game. Extremely early impression - This is how you make a good camera and control interface for a character.At worst, this game's features, in particular character appearance and customization seem very early. Painfully simplistic and in general, lacking. I'm reminded of early 2000's era mmo characters or FPS games of the same early time period. Further the number of Schumacher moments your rag doll character will have when it falls or crashes are more than a little comical. To the point of almost being embarrasing.The above said, I fully suggest the game be tried and played around with. It's such a wonderful, easy to experience, touristic environment that the frailties of the characters can be ignored.			"

								I bought the starter pack a long time ago and now the game is f2p. It's awful compared to when I bought it. first of all the engine has been changed and it's awful now, the game is optimized worse, the physics are worse and the tricks feel wrong. Before you could just hold a button to get speed now you need to tap it to gain speed and hold it to tuck it's awful. The tricks in the new engine are glitchy, bad looking and some tricks are too slow and others too fast. They also added snowboards imo they should have made the skiing good before adding bad snowboarding into the game.overall the game used to be soooooo much better so if they actually read reviews they should just downgrade (upgrade) back to the old engine.

								I am not that good at writing reviews but here goes:SNOW, is an absolute delight. I was more than happy tp buy the founders pack knowing that the money would hopefully be going to the developers of such and amazing game.  The beauty of it all is breath taking. If you haven't been ontop of a Mountain as the Sun rises or sets this is pretty damn close.Yes this may be early alpha but it still handles amazingly. No major bugs that causes you to rip your hair out, just funny little ones such and not wiping out after htting and rock and just standing there like ""I don't give a F***"".  The controls are easy once you learn them and you can happily explore all over the mountain, and it isn't even finished yet!I urge you to buy this game, it is fantastic.			"

								Beautiful and satisfying game. Availability to customize your character, but not huge variety of items. A bit confusing and ridiculous controls. Buggy game and to small opportunity to interact with other players. This game need some serious and hard work to make it good. This game is like useless piece of rock who need just a bit of care and work to make it shining diamond. I will recommend this game to everyone who missed good winter sport time, who like crazy stunt tricks and who love snowy alps nature view. Hope that this game will take my advice and will make it better.			"

								Just bought the game because I like skiing and snowsports, but at this time it really is not worth getting into. I understand it's in an early alpha stage, but unless you buy the most expensive version you literally only get a few trails to ride on one section of the mountain.Additionally, there's no way to rebind controls, the tutorial only explains how to move forward with KB+M controls, and overall the game feels lacking. I know more content will come, but it's laughable that they'd offer something with no sound this early for a fairly high price.For the time being, I can't recommend this game. Maybe I'll edit it once more patches and updates come through, but for now it remains incredibly underdeveloped.			"

Acceleration on ice is near impossible. You can wall ride fences very realisticly. The game looks REAL!

Stimulating yet relaxing gameplay.3. Beautiful and unique environmental graphics that perfectly adhere to the games context.4. Addictive but not hard to leave alone either.Cons:1. Experience system seems slow paced.2. In-game store seems overpriced.3. No real feeling of a career.Summary:Overall this is a game you should not miss and has surpassed any skating, boarding or skiing game I have played in the past. This game has a unique feel that other games have failed at delivering. Overall easily one of the best games to experience on steam			"

								This is exactly what Early Access is supposed to be!First of all, the game is, lacking features such as snowboards, and sound, but that's okay. It's early access, so you know what to expect. Second, this is going to be a F2P game, and although many people argue that paying now for a F2P game is not smart, I have to disagree there. With buying, you're making sure that it doesn't need to be milked out as much as Pay2Win games. And, developers need to eat as well.Having said that, the game is actually quite enjoyable. I loved the first person camera mode, and I can only imagine how great it'll be when I buy an Oculus Rift (Which it supports). In this state, all you can do is set up your graphics settings, and ski on this huge♥♥♥♥♥mountain. It is bigger than expected. If you buy any of the 2 tiers, you can access Multiplayer right away, if you choose for the cheapest tier, you'll have to wait a little longer. But looking on their websites, and the upcoming features, made me excited. I could only dream that such a small team could accomplish so many already.			"

								Recently got this game for $1 through♥♥♥♥♥and honestly I didn't have very high expectations, but after only 2+ hours I have been suprised at the level of detail in the environment and the amount of effort the developers have put in to SNOW. Saying that, I still do have concerns with this game.Pros:- Very large open world to explore with multiple mountains and drop points.- Clean UI and a fantastic soundtrack.- Hidden secrets and locations to come across (caves, castles, etc).- The graphics are great, not mindblowing, but it certainly looks ""next gen"".- Atmospheric. I can imagine this being very immersive with VR...- Simple controls and fun gameplay.Cons:- The biggest concern for me is that from what I know, there is no way to get credits without buying them with real money. Especially since the developers boast a high level of customisation and character creation. Paying $15 for a new set of pants and a jacket simply isn't worth it, and if they look at games such as Payday 2 and Killing Floor 2, they will see that expensive microtransactions can drive a supportive fanbase away.- At the time of writing this, there are a lot of bugs. I have had the game crash on my multiple times during my time playing. - Multiplayer isn't great. It's not bad, but needs improvement.- Grinding doesn't work very well. A few reccomendations - Add an additional way to get credits.- Needs more animations. Not my biggest issue, but a lot of other people feel the need for it too. Take a leaf out of SSX's book.- Being able to interact with the world around you would be great. Taking a ride on the lifts, meeting your friends in a cabin etc.TL;DR - Is this game fun? Definately. Is it worth paying $10 for? No. "

								Hello to any person interested in the game SNOW! Although it was released in October 2010 the dev team have decided to stay in this early access open beta so they can maximize crowd feedback and also implement fun new ideas. When you get this game I would recommend you have an appreciation for the sports and kind of game at hand. What you get is a Free to Play open world Skiing game with abilities to customize your character and eventually you'll be able to build snow jumps on the side of a mountain! The Physics and Graphics are great and make for a great time spent with some random people or you can go on a solo exploration in free roam.Things to keep in mind:Customizations are bought through Gold which you can either buy or earn while playing...you gain 25-35 every so often upon leveling up. I spent about $10 and could pretty much put a outfit together.The team is currently working on the Snowboard/Snowmobile options.With the realistic feel and the great graphics I wouldnt see any reason not to get this game at  the steep price of ZERO!

								Fun, yet buggy.This game is truly beatiful. I have never seen such perfectionate graphics. I get a stable framerate.However, this game still is mildly annoying with the bugs. Sometimes crashes and temporarily breaks your computer until you reboot it.When you go into the online multiplayer menu, the game goes down to about 2 frames per second and can take up to 10 minutes to find a game due to the immence lag.But that doesn't make the game boring, once you do go online, oh the fun to be had!There still are bugs online however. When you jump it takes 3 seconds to do it, but I'm not sure whether it was just a laggy server.Astronomically fun, mildly laggy, extraordinarily beatiful.			"

								I absolutely love this game. I recommend you at least try it and see what you think. It can be addictive. I look forward to seeing new additions and improvements to the game in future. So glad to pick this up for free. As a snowboarder myself I really enjoy goofing about on here and having a laugh when I mess up a jump or faceplant. They have a lot of options in the shop and accumulating enough credits to buy things is an incentive to keep playing. I like the funky colours of some of the clothing.  Hoping in future they add a female rider   so I can play my gender but not too fussed about it either way.  "

								This is to Jonny Moseley Mad Trix as Skate 3 is to the Tony Hawk Pro Skater series.If the goal of sport-simulation games are to recreate the emotions and emulate the motions from their target, SNOW is taking the right steps toward that goal.From the start, I'm most immediately impressed with the visuals and aurals. The UI, models, and mountain itself with all its parts are gorgeous even on the lowest settings, which still beat up my GPU/CPU - no complaints as I'm using some older gear. There's a radio-style soundtrack that plays some great stuff that I want to get in my library - sorta electronica styled, I heard some vocal tracks, too. Reminds me of Chairlift or Bloc Party. The swoosh of skis and - though I haven't grinded rails or pulled off crazy jumps - the grinds sound real and constant enough to immersify me.As a cross-country and downhill skiier of 8 years, the game targets my demographic of speed-seekers - but I can see the appeal to anyone who likes an open world where you can choose your fun. Meditatively ski from point A to B, gazing across the valley - or shred hard and fast off-piste taking opportune upward slopes to show off your aerial skills. I'm eager to virtually ski again, eager to get better gear to play full-screen on high graphics, eager to see every patch of SNOW there is to be seen.			"

								After messing about in the game for a good while I can say that the game is enjoyable to some extent.Free roaming and just having fun in the slopes themselves is a blast, but when you start doing events you better be prepared for a good amount of restarts due to very unpredictable behavior. Sometimes my rider started going the wrong direction or didn't start at all before i started to tap the forward button like a maniac.When you eventually crash your character ragdolls all over the place Goat Simulator style.If you had to put me on the spot and ask if I wanted to pay for this I'd probably pass but seeing as its free and a relatively small game, give it a go!

It looks sick. This is less of an exciting action-packed game and more of a visual experience. I loved it.			"

								Great game with lots of potential. Its super fun to play in the state its in now but its got some bugs and lots of gameplay features have yet to be implemented. Snow is getting a lot of flak from people about its microtransactions, but I really can't understand how people can complain. The microtransactions are just for asthetics, goggles, jackets skies ect. and help support the developers. They will also allow the game to be free to play which will give a lot more people the chance to try it out without having to drop any money. Skiing around, doing a few tricks, exploring the mountian are all really fun. The best sense of adventure and exploration ive played in a game for a while. And for the most part the game plays great, except for when it doesnt. The physcics aren't spot on, but theyre getting close and I'm confident that they will tweak it just right for when the game actually launches. There is a few bugs, but it is early access so that should not be a token of how the game will play on release. For the most part bugs consist of occasionally falling over when I feel like I shouldnt have, although there might be some preformance issues on older pc's. The soundtrack is boppin, many a foot tap to be had. I wan't to get a few of the songs on my phone. The game looks amazing, it may as well be an ad for cryengine. Type in e_timeofday 6 (or 18) for some sunset sunrise double s action. All in all, this game is really great. Free 2 play with cosmetic purchaseables is a really neat direction for this game to go. I cannot reccomend it enough.//Slight rant...Also if one more goshdarn person asks for snowboards im gonna explode. They've said that snowboards will be added, its the most minor thing in terms of gameplay, and its a monumental effort to rig and animate something like a skiier/snowboarder. Just wait. You bought a skiing game. Frustrates me when people dislike a game for such a minor reason.			"

								This game is one I recommend to almost anyone.Whether you like Skiing or not, you can still find fun in this game. Going fast down a mountain and doing flips and grabs attempting to dodge trees and rocks is adrenaline pumping and will surely make you happy. The graphics are amazing despite being an Early Access Game and there are almost no noticeable bugs. Realism is something that could be added as I enjoy skiing in real life as much as in games. Jumps seem too easy and spinning sometimes gets too fast. If you do not have enough to fund this game yet, you can check out one other game that looks similar to this called Shredsauce.http://www.shredsauce.com/ "

								I bought the starter pack a long time ago and now the game is f2p. It's awful compared to when I bought it. first of all the engine has been changed and it's awful now, the game is optimized worse, the physics are worse and the tricks feel wrong. Before you could just hold a button to get speed now you need to tap it to gain speed and hold it to tuck it's awful. The tricks in the new engine are glitchy, bad looking and some tricks are too slow and others too fast. They also added snowboards imo they should have made the skiing good before adding bad snowboarding into the game.overall the game used to be soooooo much better so if they actually read reviews they should just downgrade (upgrade) back to the old engine.

Acceleration on ice is near impossible. You can wall ride fences very realisticly. The game looks REAL!

Stimulating yet relaxing gameplay.3. Beautiful and unique environmental graphics that perfectly adhere to the games context.4. Addictive but not hard to leave alone either.Cons:1. Experience system seems slow paced.2. In-game store seems overpriced.3. No real feeling of a career.Summary:Overall this is a game you should not miss and has surpassed any skating, boarding or skiing game I have played in the past. This game has a unique feel that other games have failed at delivering. Overall easily one of the best games to experience on steam			"

								Tl;dr: Game is quite buggy and barely playable as of right now, but it has major potential.FOREWORD: **** THIS GAME IS GOING TO BE FREE TO PLAY ON FULL RELEASE ****Graphics look nice. Cryengine does this game well. FPS drops occur occasionally, but overall it's not an issue.Gameplay is meh. The one playable mountain as of right now looks nice, bit its hard to get down the different trails to explore the mountain more. Controls are very loose, making it hard to get where you want to be, be it jumping onto a rail or just going down a trail. Tricks are pretty basic, with some grabs and spins. Multiplayer and 'events' are being added later, and (hopefully) some of the falling through the map will stop.Customizations is pretty good. There are a lot of options to customize your skiier, from hats and gloves to bindings and poles. You can sort by category of equipment or by brand, and a lot of major skiing companies have their equipment represented in the game.Verdict: Wait it out. If you want to support the devs, go right ahead. Just be warned that 1) This game is going to be free-to-play on release, and 2) This game is playable, but not for very long. The gameplay is fun as a time waster, but IMO not for its current pricetag			"

								Most poorly designed snowboarding game I've ever played.Clearly, they spent more time on the UI and menus than the actual game, because while the menus look nice, the game is awful. The snow doesn't have any deformation at all and constantly clips through snowboards / skis. Wipeouts should be funny in a snowboarding game, but here, they're tedious. You turn into a tombstone with no animation whatsoever and you're stuck there until you respawn on someone. Controls are unintuitive and cumbersome, and there's little to no interesting content. It looks like they really tried to create an interesting map with lots of good areas, but when your grind mechanic doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing work, why would you create such a nice rail spot? It doesn't make sense to me. Clearly there was more thought put into the map than the mechanics. Just don't bother. Get Steep instead.  "

Even in its current state with skiing only I managed to enjoy myself and will definitely be playing some more in the future.Glad to see a positive attitude from the developers during the course of development and I'm looking forward to how this pans out. Also really happy to see a DLC model with better intentions. Its just cosmetic gear pieces so in no way does it offer an advantage to anyone, plus those credits you can buy in game to purchase gear, can now be earnt with levelling up which is a great added feature.Its free so what do you have to lose? Get it!			"

								Purchased this as it boasted VR Support and showed the Oculas Rift on its webpage. Unfortunatly this is a purchase I very much regret for now.WHile it looks and plays fine in 2D for an Alpha product, when you enable 3D via the Oculas Rift I found the game unplayable. This is the only time i've found the experience better in 2D than in 3D through the rift.General complaints are: Low Framerate (Even when all settings are set to low)Very Flat ""3D"" objects. Such as Trees and background. (Looks like a flat picture as the background)Distancing issue with objects (The moon appears about 4 meters away from your head and closer than other objects)Very sparse amount of 3D objects so you get a very poor 3D feel.View disorientating. (If your character is infront of your view. Head tracking does not work correctly) When in ""First Person"" any character movement affects your view.Overall I would not recommend this game for use with the Oculas Rift as its a disappointing experience. If this changes, im happy to update this review.			"

Early Access Review
								So, I got it free. That's something, right?After playing Xtreme games like Skate 1-3, I have to say... This isn't that good. Yet. I know, skateboarding isn't snowboarding or skiing, but some tricks (or what the game determines as tricks) are similar. Grinding. A game should be a forgiving and have a bit of a hook to a rail. Skate will hook you to the rail most of the time. When you slow down, you bail or slide off. This game, you jump, hoping to God you go in the direction of the rail, then you might land or slide off. You might even do some physics breaking wall-slide on it too. The word ""might"" is used way too often in this game. I'd say 75% of the time, you'll get points off your score if you land a trick. Apparently, you have to master the game in order for your moves not to be sketchy. So, in other words, you might get points, you might get more points.Having said ""if you land a trick"", I mostly mean that when you do some big air tricks. Your man might just rotate all he wants. You'll be able to rewind, which is cool, but why should I constantly have too? I know there are ways to rotate vertically and horizontally, but I just find it can be very random anyways. Maybe I'm just not figuring that part out.As for graphics, which I usually don't talk much about due to my lack of caring, I just have to mention the animation for trying to speed up. Most animations look pretty real, but that one looks like some sort of spasm. It's kind of annoying too, which is why I have to mention it, because I find I'll have to keep pushing it all of the time to keep some speed when not on a hill (even then, you don't speed up sometimes). So I'll be playing, tapping the button while watching the guy having a seizure. I know he can't just push the board like skateboarding, I'm just saying that the animation looks strange.Most of this so far is pretty negative, but really, there are a few good things. The rest of the graphics look decent for a free game. Most of the user interface is nice looking and easy to use, although switching to skiing in the menu doesn't seem to work, but I've only tried once. Some of the riding feels smooth and nice (don't quite know any other words for it), but like I said, you go slow pretty fast, jumping for rails can be annoying, and air can be a little too tough to land without rewinding.It's early access and it's free, but I don't just want to say I recommend it for those reasons. The game may turn out better later, but due to it's quality now, I have to say I wouldn't recommend it. Gameplay is the main part for a game, and the flaws affect this one quite a bit.			"

								a Must-Play  for anyone who likes skiing/wintersports. I don't really write reviews but since this game is still being worked on I will use this as a place to provide valuable feedback to the developer. 1. Time Trial mode gives you three medals. It does not tell you in what time you must finish to obtain these medals. I'm almost certain just finishing the course without any collision awards a Bronze - but silver and gold need additional information.2. I am unable to turn off the music in the game. I turned it all the way down in the options yet the music is still playing. Annnnnoying. 3. Game crashes within an hour or so into me playing(sometimes in as little as 5 minutes. Says due to some sort of graphical error. CryEngine Error.DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_HUNG  --  Some times I can reopen the game and other times-Steam will say I still have the application ALREADY RUNNING in the background (When that is not the case). Resulting in me having to reboot my machine to start the game again.  4. Glad to see Steam Achievements added - However they are all hidden so you don't even know what to do to unlock them. Annnnnoying.5. Leaderboards are broken---please make them actually work correctly. 6. ZERO CUSTOMIZATION of your rider. All the gear is PURCHASEABLE only. NEED BOTH FREE AND PAID CONTENT... DONT BE STUPID.			"

 Steep just works best for me, but SNOW is free.... SNOW was a great game when there wasn't any competition on the PC market. Now there is, and I see no reason to play SNOW anymore. Steep outclasses it in each category - it was good while it lasted. I backed it during Beta... and lost the items I had which was annoying.  6/10  "

								Fun relaxing gameI think there should be f2p items in the store though, maybe purchasable with a seperate currency than the paid in game credits than can be aqcuired through challenges and events, etc... The game is a bit of a challenge to play without a controller because you need to use arrow keys to do grabs but the mouse to control the camera, making it difficult to see sometimes, so maybe could improve on the controls for keyboard players.I'd also like the to see the snow clipping through the skis and snowboard fixed later on, as well as actual ragdoll bails in multiplayer. The snow clipping through isnt a big deal but it would look a lot nicer if that didn't happen.			"

Even for an early access game like this it blows me away; visually it is stunning - I run a HD6770 which is almost the bare minimun requirements, keeping to a medium visual setting the game still looks fantastic, its games like this that make me wish I had a more powerful PC. Love the ambient soundtrack in the background too.Can't really fault this title with it being an early access game right now, perhaps the silly ragdoll effect is a little crazy, but when you clip a rock it's hilarious.

								Great game, big selling potential. Unique in it's genre. Graphics are beautiful. Played skiing only with xbox one controller. A few points to make this game even better:1. award points for great speed instead of stunts only.2. fix skiing tutorial: it's bugged in the part where you have to do a 720. Can't continue even if you complete the 720. 3. make sure you can also break while cornering which you can also do in real life and make sure you can use the break to stand still instantly, also possible in real life. 4. add ability to make own playlist of music.5. don't add ingame money which you need to buy with real money. Make us earn in game money by completing events. 6. make a (time trial) event for every slope. 7. make skiing over roads slow you down instead of just going the same speed as if it were snow. I hope this feedback helps!			"

								don't buy this. the game is so early in development it feels like production began a week ago. the game is completely without audio, without so much as menu music. the animations are simple, something i could create in any 3D animations program within minutes. the UI is awful, as when i hover my mouse over options they flicker and disappear on my screen, making the options hard to select. i have to press the ""play"" button repeatly before it actuates, just to spawn myself in the game. the physics and such are also terrible, as i'm able to land upside down without crashing but i can hit a small bump and fall. tricks are limited to flips and spins, even the BMX system in tony hawk's american wasteland had much more effort put into it. my screen is plagued 4 out of 5 times i run this game with ""texture compiling"" in big black letters all over, making the game almost unplayable as i can't really see anything. i regret purchasing this game with tf2 keys as i can't get a refund for this god awful game. lucky it's going to be free to play because the developers are getting money at the moment for a game that has had maybe 30 hours of work put into it.

								The idea is good and I am happy to spend money to support games like this but honestly, this game is buggy with little objective which makes it hard to keep playing this game. I have 69 hours because I am a ski nut and I've owned this game for over two years but as of right now, I would not buy it.			"

								Great game, big selling potential. Unique in it's genre. Graphics are beautiful. Played skiing only with xbox one controller. A few points to make this game even better:1. award points for great speed instead of stunts only.2. fix skiing tutorial: it's bugged in the part where you have to do a 720. Can't continue even if you complete the 720. 3. make sure you can also break while cornering which you can also do in real life and make sure you can use the break to stand still instantly, also possible in real life. 4. add ability to make own playlist of music.5. don't add ingame money which you need to buy with real money. Make us earn in game money by completing events. 6. make a (time trial) event for every slope. 7. make skiing over roads slow you down instead of just going the same speed as if it were snow. I hope this feedback helps!			"

								Please tell us Early Acess-ers get cool stuff once the F2P version comes out...Other than that the game is good for an alpha, just lemme tell you what you are getting into.1. No sound, like at all. They plan to add sound and music in the future but in the meantime you're gonna have to play your own tunes.2. It's not as easy to pick up and play as the trailer makes it out to be. The controls take time and patience.3. Only 1 level/mountain right now. They obviously plan to add more in the future.4. The graphics are achieved by cryengine and the game is decently optimised but has very little options for visuals.That's about it, take t^h^o^s^e facts and do with your money what you will.			"

								SNOW is still in alpha, and therefore can hardly be judged as a final product, but as it is now, it is not worth buying. All there is to do is free roam the mountain with no objective, and really, nothing is of interest other than the few trick courses. It gets really repetitive just seeing trees and rocks over and over again. Furthermore, the game has no audio, which will just further add to the monotony. You might be able to extend the experience by messing around with the gravity in the game files, but really, as it is in alpha, this game only has about three hours of enjoyable content at most. Hopefully future updates will make the game an enjoyable experience, which it does have the potential to become, but just don't buy it in alpha. Pass judgement when there is more to the game.			"

								Excuse me people, but cause you can't add $15 to the game and get your character better looki' it DOES NOT mean AT ALL that the game sucks. You all basterds, look at the game!! The developers are awesome and they update it a lot, I bought the game before 2 days or so, and the Multiplayer Servers are VERY active! at least 3 players everyday in a server. (Now I know 3 players isn't a lot but this game is a Beta + people don't buy it just CAUSE the character lookin'..) Anyway to the point:Pros:*Great Lookin' Menu - Really nice to the eyes!*Character Lookin' - Listen, You can just add $15 and you will have your dream character, + don't listen to people that CRY over character lookin'... C'mon are you a baby?! :/* Tricks - There are A LOT of tricks in the game, tricks to the GROUND and in to the AIR.*Free Roam - The Free Roam is so beautiful, it really is I recommend you to check it out! There isn't only 1 mountain there are more + there are some parks and events. (as well challenges).*Multiplayer - As I said, not too much to say cause the multiplayer has all I said now ;) but yeah it is really nice that there is multiplayer, you can have some new friends do some tricks together, chill out and have some fun!*Controls - You can choose what to play with, Keyboard / Controler, I think it is really nice!P.S Awesome game but! For all the people who think this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥and they judge it cause of the character lookin' are pretty much..♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s you stop the game improving it self just CAUSE you CRY about character lookin'...Go *** ok?Cons:*Physics - The physics are a bit clunky when you Crash but overall when you just play without crashing they are good.*Controls* - Not really a con :/ I just want to say you can't yet change the controls on PC, but I don't know what about Controler though, But as I said it really isn't a con it's just you can't change them yet!Overall!5 Pros.2 Cons.Opinion about the game:Really it is my opinion but I really hope you will try it out guys, seriously you are not homless it is only $10 bucks! c'mon show some help for the ""Updating Developers"" :) they really do update a lot which is a Pro isn't it? oh wait!*6 Pros.*2 Cons.So I hope I made it a little more sharper for you! Please buy the game and help it improve, it's only a BETA BTW if you didn't know! so yeah have a great day and I hope you will listen to me! Cya :D (If you wanna know more add me to friends I have a STEAM GIFT OF THE GAME Yes!!! so yeah cya :D)			"

								Right now: finicky controls take a bit to get used to, but it's really nice once you get the hang of things.  Item store offers ways ingame to earn currency, and all items are cosmetic right now.  Currently, only the skiing module is released.  Very average looking, with good music (though it gets repetitive, there aren't enough tracks).  It's a breath of fresh air for games, especially sports games, IMO, and easily worth $10 right now.  Looking foward to the snowboarding module!			"

								This game... This is one of the most legit ski games I have played. I am a snowboarder in person, but that doesnt take anything away from my gameplay experience. One of the main reasons I love this game so much is how active the developers are. They dont F*ck around, they respond to the community, and they seem to add enough content with every update to keep me interested (unlike dayz). Pros Great physics (slightly glitchy at times, but its early access) MultiplayerBeautiful mapAmazing jumps, and many many jumps you have yet to findConsThey have not added snowboarding :( The game is called ""SNOW"" but it seems only ski basedThe trails your skiis leave are a little bit glitchyOverall, great game and you should definately buy it to support the developers.

								Though I haven't played this game too much, I think I am capable of writing a solid review since there isn't too much in the game yet.  To start, I think this game is a very good start to what could potentially turn into the best free game on steam.  I will now do a pros and cons list.Pros:-graphics are very good for early stage-Rewind mechanic lets you fix mistakes easily if you want to hit that jump perfectly-though there are microtransactions, they are limited to asthetic only, and if this business model holds true I will be very happy-very interesting and fun map design (Main mountainous map)-Good frame rate/no frame dropping even at high speed (I am on an alienware 13 laptop)Cons:-in air controls can sometime feel clunky-needs a camera control feature so you can look around the enivironment-skiier is sometimes stuck in revers, and is hard to turn around-multiplayer needs more way to interact with other playersConclusion:If you are looking for a skiing game than you should be extremely excited for this one to release in full.  It has the chance to become a fantastic game.  What the devs need to work on is the controls and multiplayer, but it is understandable that these wouldn't be perfect as the game is clearly still in early development.  I would highly recommend this game to most people, especially those in the Northeast, like me, who have had no snow and need their skiing itch to be statisfied.  So far this game has helped me to keep my mind off the dissapointing lack of snow this winter.			"

								Excuse me people, but cause you can't add $15 to the game and get your character better looki' it DOES NOT mean AT ALL that the game sucks. You all basterds, look at the game!! The developers are awesome and they update it a lot, I bought the game before 2 days or so, and the Multiplayer Servers are VERY active! at least 3 players everyday in a server. (Now I know 3 players isn't a lot but this game is a Beta + people don't buy it just CAUSE the character lookin'..) Anyway to the point:Pros:*Great Lookin' Menu - Really nice to the eyes!*Character Lookin' - Listen, You can just add $15 and you will have your dream character, + don't listen to people that CRY over character lookin'... C'mon are you a baby?! :/* Tricks - There are A LOT of tricks in the game, tricks to the GROUND and in to the AIR.*Free Roam - The Free Roam is so beautiful, it really is I recommend you to check it out! There isn't only 1 mountain there are more + there are some parks and events. (as well challenges).*Multiplayer - As I said, not too much to say cause the multiplayer has all I said now ;) but yeah it is really nice that there is multiplayer, you can have some new friends do some tricks together, chill out and have some fun!*Controls - You can choose what to play with, Keyboard / Controler, I think it is really nice!P.S Awesome game but! For all the people who think this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥and they judge it cause of the character lookin' are pretty much..♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s you stop the game improving it self just CAUSE you CRY about character lookin'...Go *** ok?Cons:*Physics - The physics are a bit clunky when you Crash but overall when you just play without crashing they are good.*Controls* - Not really a con :/ I just want to say you can't yet change the controls on PC, but I don't know what about Controler though, But as I said it really isn't a con it's just you can't change them yet!Overall!5 Pros.2 Cons.Opinion about the game:Really it is my opinion but I really hope you will try it out guys, seriously you are not homless it is only $10 bucks! c'mon show some help for the ""Updating Developers"" :) they really do update a lot which is a Pro isn't it? oh wait!*6 Pros.*2 Cons.So I hope I made it a little more sharper for you! Please buy the game and help it improve, it's only a BETA BTW if you didn't know! so yeah have a great day and I hope you will listen to me! Cya :D (If you wanna know more add me to friends I have a STEAM GIFT OF THE GAME Yes!!! so yeah cya :D)			"

								Right now: finicky controls take a bit to get used to, but it's really nice once you get the hang of things.  Item store offers ways ingame to earn currency, and all items are cosmetic right now.  Currently, only the skiing module is released.  Very average looking, with good music (though it gets repetitive, there aren't enough tracks).  It's a breath of fresh air for games, especially sports games, IMO, and easily worth $10 right now.  Looking foward to the snowboarding module!			"

								I found the controller controls to be harder to use than the keyboard, so I actually recommend the keyboard.  I just heavily recommend rebinding the ""flip forward"" key to anything other than the same key for ""move forward"" (W).  I use the 2 key.It's also frustrating having to start at the beginning of the run every time you crash, which for some maps (Bluesky Burgers) is incredibly annoying because you have to spend 15 seconds every time rounding the lodge before you even get to the course.  If there was an option to respawn just a little higher up the mountain from where you fell/crashed, that would make this game infinitely better.  OR just make it so a crash doesn't end your run -- make the player fall down, but let him get back up and keep going?  Just penalize the player with XP or something.As of now I really like the game, it's just these fixes seem so obvious that it's annoying to play knowing how easily it could be fixed.But regardless of those points, I do recommend it.

								SNOW is a great game, especially as it is free-to-play. It boasts decent graphics, but they're good enough to be pretty realistic. As the game is in Early Access, I would like to see more added to the game. It's hilarious and the developers have done a great job with this one. Offline mode would be nice, but as I discovered why the developers didn't add it, maybe in the near future I guess? It would be interesting what this game has in store for the steam community in the future			"

But it's a free game and for being a free game, it's really ♥♥♥♥ing good.There is microtransactions but those are only for skins like diffrent hats, pants, snowboards, etc. You don't win in this game, you have fun. That is what games should be about and I really had fun in this game. I would really recommend this to anyone and I would say I am surprised this is free. I would pay 30-40$ for this game.			"

								I've owned this game since it was first released as closed beta or something on Steam when you still had to pay for the game. I've watched the game evolve from just a game you could ride around to what it is now. I don't know what I think about the games state right now, but it's still a lot of fun for a couple of hours. You have a few different maps, whereas there is one you'll probably find yourself playing on the most. The big mountain Sialia is the biggest free area in the whole game, and here you can find everything. Slopes, parks with both big and small jumps, rails, half pipes etc, and you can find some super cool off-piste lines by exploring yourself. Once you find a new spawnpoint, you can always come back there. Trickwise there are many. There are many cool grabs, although I would like to see even more combinations. You can rotate in every way possible. Backwards, forwards, do rolls, 360s and combine all of them for a sideflip or something else. This is good.Contentwise there are many maps to play, but as a free to play game you have to pay for most of them. I have not purchased anything other than the starterpack back when I first purchased the game, but I still find it fun when I have 30 minutes to do something, so purchasing anything isn't neccesary at all.

								Keeping in mind this game is early access AND free to play, this game is amazing. The graphics are absolutely stunning. There could be more music tracks but the ones that are in game are great. Remappable controls were recently added and that makes things even easier to do. There are a few glitches here and there but the devs are very helpful and willing to communicate on the discussion forums. Though this game is free to play I'd be willing to pay upwards of $20 even for the state it is currently in. Snowboards and snowmobiles are coming soon along with many other updates and bug fixes which is even more incentive to keep playing. Keep up the great work guys, I can't wait to see what's to come.

								I have over 100 games in my steam library and this is my FIRST review (I think...) so let that sink in for a moment before you judge my comments.This game has to be the most RAGE INDUCING piece of crud I have ever played, and I grew up playing Battletoads. I'm just going to keep it simple;PROS:- Great visuals and atmosphere.- Easy to use controls and can be used with a controller (recommended).- Awesome soundtrack (in my opinion, the most refined thing about the game).- It's free.CONS:- Touch a rock, you die.- You land slightly off, you die.- Touch ice, you die. (I'm serious, the amount of times I've landed softly on ice and died).- When you spawn at the start of an event, your character sometimes decided to go the wrong way.- The game feels empty, there just aren't enough players to make multiplayer feel worth it.- No Multiplayer events (not that I've found, maybe you have to pay)- When you die your board magically flies away and you have to respawn at the start (even in free mode) *like seriously, I'd much prefer it if my character got up, brushed themselves off and carried on.You might feel that my cons are over exaggerated, however I've been playing for just over 5 hours and already its making me develop cancer. It's a shame, it has potential, it's just not being used.			"

								SNOWBOARDING IS HERE. still needs some work, but its a ton of funAPRIL UPDATE-Snowboarding and snowmobiles on the way at the end of this month!(i know this isnt a real update to a review, that will come when they are actually implemented)P.S. Lulz @ skiholes who didnt like my review because of snowboard comments~OPEN BETA UPDATE~After a rough start the devs pumped out multiple hotfixes within a day and have the game up and running. definately worth checking out.also remember to harass the devs to add snowboarding like they said they were going to.~WRITTEN DURING CLOSED BETA~In a world where realistic extreme sports games are no more, especially on PC, SNOW is a light in the darkness. Thats not to say its without its problems though. Pros-Physics. I've worked as a liftie in Vt and can say the feel of being on snow/rails/boxes is all solid and in line with really cruising down a mountain-Optional First Person Mode. Why havent more extreme sports games done first person? there arent words to describe hitting a double cork 1080 in first person.-Open Mountain. you literally have accesss to the ENTIRE mountain. want trails? they are there. want a park? there are a few. want backcountry, go nuts.-Ragdoll Bails. While these arent the most realistic animations in the world, they will leave you cringing and laughing after you smash a rock at speedCons-No Snowboarding. This is a big one for me. when this game was on kickstarter the devs were promising snowboarding was going to be added as soon as the basics of skiing were in. this has not happened and there has been no news to hint that it is still planned. it leaves the mountains feeling like those douchey ski only resorts. wheres the boarder love?-rough multiplayer. the devs announced that they will be upgrading thier servers when the game goes to open beta. this is very much needed as a random lag spike can kill an amazing run down the mountain or ruin a nice freeroam follow the leader session-microtransactions. there are a lot of them. essentially everything to customize your rider costs real money (not much compared to some other games though) there also appears to be some ""events"" that you buy into with real money (havent tried these so i cant speak to much on them)-wierd snow behavior. i know i know, its a beta. but sometimes snow will magically leave a trail in the air behind you when you jump, and it stays that way even on your next run down the mountain, this isnt a major issue but can cause issues lining up jumps and grinds in the parks.Overall: is SNOW worth it?if you have been craving some realistic extreme sports or if you are a mountain lifer then this game is definately for you. if you like exploring in a relaxing setting this game is probably for you. if you want somethinglike tony hawks pro skater on skis, you should stay far far away.

Early Access Review
								At the moment, I can not recommend this game.Horrible Slushy controls:I have an Xbox One controller, yet the game kept insisting on showing me a PS4 controller layout.Movement commands felt laggy, and my machine way out specs the recommendations.Very poor tutorials:Telling a person how to do something is okay, but SHOWING them first works much better.Freedom is a good thing, but when you have no real direction in order to know how to usesaid freedom, freedom can become a burden.Stale and empty enviroment:At no time did I ever feel like I was on a real mountain.With stark, simple graphics, no AI wondering around ANYWHERE, no wild life, no wind or weather effects,Just felt like I was entirely alone on top of a mountain that man hadn't been to in 50 years.There were a few small things I did like.First-Person Camera and sense of speed:I did like the sense of speed once you could actually get some speed, and I liked the movementof the first-person camera.If I had to pick right now between this and Steep, Steep would win.You need to decide if your going for a simulation or a game.It feels more like a sim at the moment, but lacks the fidelity and precision of a simulation.The game feeling is not present at all. No fun, or excitement to be felt at all.Will review again once game leave Early Access.But for now, I wouldn't recommend spending any real money on this.This game has a long way to go before it is finished.

								I understand that snow is now a Free To Play Beta, and that the game isn't expected to be perfect. I will just be saying how things are (for me and a lot of other people, not everyone). First off, SNOW is a lot of fun, singleplayer and (sometimes) multiplayer are great and the game has a lot of potential and it would be an amazing game if only... It worked, which it kinda doesn't at the moment. The game is constantly crashing (for me and a couple of others who tried out the game). Multiplayer is a mess.All the servers are mostly full because of the 12 players cap and they will always display that they have over 300+ ping when they actually don't. When hovering over someone's name in the spawnmenu the game will put a camera on them like you're spectating them. If you scroll through the players (unintetionally) the camera will glitch out and it might crash your game because the FPS drops to 0-2. Sometimes when you spawn, there will be random invisible walls right infront of you completely blocking your movement and it takes away all your points if you jump because of 'bad landing'. Sometimes the walls are placed a bit infront of you so after you gained some speed you instantly crash because of the god damn wall. Sometimes when other players spawn on you, it will make you crash instantly. These are the multiplayer problems I'm having, some might have the same, some might not.Singleplayer/EventsSingleplayer is a lot better than multiplayer in terms of the game working, but it gets easily boring skiing around by yourself. So you either jump into Multiplayer, or you go do some Events! (Since leveling up gives you no credits at all and you can unlock a yellow outfit through the events that are free. Now I warn you, if you haven't played the game or Events, this will frustrate the living **** out of you. Some Events are fairly easy, and some will make you rip your hair out. I'm not going to get into a lot of detail about this, but it kinda sucks that the events don't give you credits so you can buy your own gear instead of a boring yellow outfit. With all that said, the game is still worth downloading since it's free and it is fun, when it works.Like I said, I know this is a free to play beta and you can't expect too much from it just yet. I know the game will improve and I am definitely looking forwards to it.That's all I'm going to write for now.. "

								Really, really. Just seriously, so many glitches I encounter, making me not getting to a save point, losing all of my points... This game isn't really something that you spend tons and tons of time on, as you will get frustrated from the glitches. Sometimes when I jump off, my character freezes and cannot do a command except for basic ones like, turning and really nothing else. This could actually be fixed by wiping out, but most of the time as I try, it doesn't happen. Only get this game if you have tolerance for its glitches. I can see that you might be saying; ""IT WAS MADE IN OCT 2013!"" Well, its 3 years from then, and they should've already fixed them. It is also really hard to level up in the game too, which makes buying new gear and making it easier, requiring for 10s of hours. Only get it if you like to just play around, not going for a highscore or something, as I know a glitch will mess you up. Also, I can see that they have been doing some fixes, but FOR ME it says the last update a month ago FOR ME. And they have pretty close updates too. So really, they probably don't know how to fix what is happening to me (and us) meaning they have a bad team. No offense. I have also heard that in MAY 2016 it still is in BETA after 3 years. I don't see any potential in the game, as other devs work harder than them, releasing the out-of-BETA version out in 3 months to 2 years MAX. Only buy this game if you just do it in your freetime, not to break your friend's highscore, as the glitches will mess you up.			"

								The default camera handling is poor - where the camera points has no relevance to where you're going or what way you're facing. This is probably great for the promo video but is utterly useless without any ui elements indicating whether you're going to smash your face into a rock or land sideways. It makes it very difficult to know where you're actually going and so getting through the tutorial alone is a chore.			"

Graphics are brilliant and the character animations are smooth and fluid, you can tell most of the devs are skiers themselves. At the moment only one side of on mountain is available to ski, but even this was enough to keep me entertained for hours, there's hundreds of different paths to choose and jumps placed at regular intervals.Some things I would like added are working ski lifts or helicopter drops, AI skiers on the slopes too, and the park to be extended a bit more. Maybe add a proper winter olympics style ski jump somewhere too.And to all the people complaining about a lack of features, the big blue bar saying EARLY ACCESS might have given you a clue as to what you are paying for - do your research before you click buy!!!

This game is woeful in the fact that it has been in my library for over a year since coming out on steam and hasnt passed what veteran PS2 users would remeber of a demo disc. In fact a demo has more content.Please reconsider buying this game, in fact the money that you have for this game, buy a cheap hooker, it is much safer and worth your while.			"

								This is my review of SNOW, an Early Access game about skis.The game is very hard to review without being picky, it's good and bad.The button help was for Xbox one and I used an Logitech Multi Mode controller, That was not really an issue.Pros:-The game was fun and was very in depth,-Even with regular physics fails the game ran perfectly smooth for such a big game,-Very calming,-Music was playing to fill in the lack of sound,-Drone mode, a great way to scout out the area before you ski.Cons:-Multiplayer was slow and clunky,-You have to unlock areas in the free roam meaning it wasnt really free roam,-The controller binds were dumb, Why would you bind X to go forward and not a trigger?-No music controls, I can't change to a different song on the fly,-Graphics settings are low by default, I had to do alot of tweaking to make it run,-No walk mode, I can't take in my surroundings while I am slipping around can I?Overall, I would recommend this game but not until loads of errors are ironed out of the game.

Early Access Review
								This game should not be on Steam at all! It is broken and unplayable. Yes, you can say the game is in it's early alpha stages and I should expect bugs and general annoying gameplay. But when the developers announced that the game would be ready by Febuary of this year back in October of last and it isn't, well that just shows how little care they have for the game. I bought into the this game as the original discription that was on Steam at the first release of this half arsed early access, was snowboarding. At first they never pointed out that the snowboarding would be implimented later on in the game's life. All that was stated in the original discription is that the game was in early alpha and that it had some issues. I am sick and tired of developers throwing their game onto Steam as an ""early access"". It is terrible marketing and has already made me want to not play the game when it is fully released. If that ever happens! I shall remind you, this game was supposed to release as a free to play in Feb. It is no April and the game is yet to be released. If you are in need of money as a developer just to finish your game. Do not release it as an early access. Hype the game up, get better funding and make sure your target market knows about the game. I would have had no idea about this game as, from what I know, it has only been marketed on Steam. Get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together, developers! Stop releaseing paid, half arsed early access games with no guaranty that the game is even going to be release on time or even at all. I invested in this game because I thought at least one developer may get it right, but no. Just like the majority, they screw up and seem to have little to no care about the game itself and only the money. Now, after that rant, I can say some good things about this game. The graphics are beautiful. They really give the feeling of gliding through soft powder on a beautiful day. Or at least it does when it actually lets you spawn. The character customisation is actually good, with a wide range of branded products to chose from. Like K2 and Vokl. The mountain looks real and outstanding, especially in the highest settings. The game seems to run well with very little hiccups, even maxed out too. I honestly want to see this game succeed in a big way. But the way it is now and the way the developers failed to deliver a Febuary launch just take hope away. I am truly wanting a good snowboard/skiing sim to play as none that I have sunk any time or effort into have been rewarding. Games like Shaun White Snowboarding and Stoked are good but not outstanding. If the developers are able to pull all of this out of the bag, even with all the issues that it shouldn't have this far into the development of the game, I will recomend it. But right now, with all the issues and my personal hatred for early access game at this time, I can not recommend this game to anyone. I have hope for this game eventually turning out fantastic. But for now, it is slim. Every month I will pop back onto the game and give another test. And each time, I will edit this review. I hope for the better.			"

It's sad when devs can't even bother to make due on their promises and deliver massive features like VR. It's the difference between something unique and another version of coolboarders with less forgiving physics.Also really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to learn it's going f2p and I really wasted my money because it probably won't have vr until it's free, rendering my purchase nil. I want a class action suit!			"

								Can't speak for skiing, but snowboarding needs some work. Not even close to what it should be. I understand this game is ""Early Access"" but nothing about the game is fun in it's current state. I see great potential. The environment is relaxing to just cruise in. Something about the snow and mountains just puts me at ease and the music isn't too bad though if I were to keep playing I'd mute it for my own playlist. The snowboarding is just too off for me to enjoy. The best thing I could compare it to would be like a 90's arcade racer, except more frustrating because for some reason the physics in those make more sense.  "

								Check out SNOW and my thoughts on it in my YouTube video here:


YouTube™ Video:  

			Views: 0		



In general, the game shows a lot of promise. The mountain looks great and the physics feel balanced. It is not nearly as over the top as SSX, which I like.  What a lot of people need to realize is that this game is VERY Early Access. There is only 1 mountain (and a training slope if you want to count that), no sound, plenty of bugs, and NO multiplayer at the moment (partially untrue as of writing, I could as a Founder create a lobby and invite a friend). Pros currently:Crytek engine looks great. The mountain look phenominal.Physics feel polished and standard movement feels natural.Quite a few brands have signed on for support of the game (Redbull, K2, etc)The open world layout feels right for a skiing game.Cons currently. Keep in mind these will be improved on in later builds, but this is only for current.No MultiplayerNo SoundNumerous bugsNo tutorial worth mentioning and controls for tricks are a bit clunky.Only 1 mountain with only 1 of 4 faces containing spawn points. Many parts of that mountain unfinished.Lot of goals, but only 3 people on the dev team so progress may be slow.This is a early alpha build and some could argue this is only slightly more than a tech demo.No way to provide early backer rewards currently.With that being said the game is worth checking out if snow sports are your thing. Just keep in mind, you are paying to support the developer on this, as it will be released F2P. DO NOT BUY if you are not OK with the things I mentioned above. Simply wait it out and try it when it's released and F2P.			"

Early Access Review
								I don't normally review games, but SNOW has so much potential that i feel i have to give my feedback on it.First of all, it's a great idea, there's no other games like this and the free-roaming skiing premise has not been done very much before. Bearing in mind that it's completely free-to-play, i think it very good. It's still got many bugs, but as a free to play early access that only to be expected. There's a huge variety of maps, and the controls are relatively easy to get the hang of.However, the new update has caused my character to die whenever i get dropped off, meaning only snowboarding works as an option, which is very frustrating as skiing feels more fluid at the moment. Also, the charcter model has completely disappeared (if intentional this really detracts from the game), so my skier has is merely a floating hat and gloves, with no body.Would I recommend? Yes. its free, so why not? There are many bugs and it's certainly still in early stages, but there is huge potential here, and a finished product could be outstanding.			"

Alongside that the visuals are very dated (dispite being run on cryengine).i believe this game has a lot of promise and is very likely to go far, however at the moment it just isnt shining, it still needs a lot of work (which i appreciate as it is early access).Overall i would rate the game a 5/10 it shows promise but at the date of writing this the game is nothing special			"

If you miss winter or can't afford to ski/board like you use to then pick this up. This game will punish you though in small ways such as how you land.

								I'm not going to complain about the micro transactions as the consensus amongst gamers should be quite clear for everyone already (yes devs, hint hint, we who had hopes in you paid for this already). SNOW has great potential but it crashes every freaking five minutes or so at the very moment. At its current state SNOW is more unstable than ever and I've been playing this every now and then for almost two years now. I would've expected more of the devs. I really do not write reviews here, but the approximately ten crashes within the last half an hour was the last straw for me. Also the sudden drops in frame rate are a common issue and I do have more than sufficient gear to play this for the freaking five minutes at the time.Dear devs, could you please make it work as I don't want to lose my hope on this. Rant over.			"

								Not recommened for PC!It is impossible to race in this game on PC without crashing.  Anytime you go airborn, the MODE of the keys you are pressing instantly change to ""Air"" mode.  This means that the left turn you are in the middle of when you hit air turns into a left windmill jump and you instantly crash.This would be a great game, but as long as the developers think it is a good idea to deny you the ability to remap keys, it is a compete failure of a PC game.  Don't bother it will just frustrate you.			"

								It's in Alpha so it'S FULL of bugs. (Some of them hilarious tho lol go see ''We Broke Snow'' on Youtube)The game crash often and sometimes the multiplayer stops working so you have to restart the game.Same thing for the menu sometimes you press start and nothing happens so you are stuck if you fall you need to kill the process and restart the whole game.BUT like i said it's alpha so i expect those kind of game breaking bugs.The servers NEED to have more than 12 people at LEAST 24 players per servers. On such a big mountain it's not enough players at the same time.Reaally fun and relaxing. The events are great. Music is great. Graphics are amazing.... and it's free so yeah you should absolutely play this.This game needs snowboards too but i'm sure it's on the way.Better played with a controller. Hard to play on keyboard.

								I was bored, found a game, played it, enjoyed it.My playtime doesn't really matter but this game does remind me of Skate 3, except that it has no Map borderlines, and its set in snow. I wouldn't be surprised if the devs choose to go for a Skating Genre or Surfing genre on the next game because they successfully did it on this one. This is definitely a cool game for an Early Access and I would love to see more from the Devs.There is one thing that needs to be fixed in the game, which is the CURSOR. It camouflages within the Menu sometimes. Maybe change it to a Blue or CyanApart from the Windows 10 looking menu, and using Cry Engine it really does succeed in reaching the goal of being a Snow-sport game.			"

								Where do I even start... this game has great potentail but has more problems than anything. First off, you have to pay real money in order to buy things for your in-game character. Which is ridiculous! The new content is not free (Snowmobile) and there are numerous bugs and glitches that have reappeared in the game. Many problems with the resolution and textures when first booting up the game. I overall think this game has the potential to be a good game, but not yet, not until the currency system gets better and the playability gets better. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.			"

								I love skiing. This game is tagged as ""Simulation"" but to be honest, it isn't that realistic. The physics is pretty weird and glitchy, in a lot of situations the character should die miserably... but he doesn't even fall.Maybe ""arcade"" or ""casual"" would be more appropriate.SNOW is still in beta, so maybe will change... but I don't think so.This doesn't mean that the game is bad. It's a F2P and there are tons of terrible paid games on steam.If you want give it a try, don't be afraid of the ""mixed"", the game is not a masterpiece but it isn't trash too.Looks like someone paid for this game, that's why there are a lot of negative reviews: devs decided to go from paid game to F2P with micro-transactions, I would be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥too, bad move.

10/10 !!This is definitely the best skiing game I've ever played, and it still is. The recently implemented new mechanics are not as good as they could be, but the developers already told us fixes are coming with the 0.5.1 patch.Well... After the closed beta update, 0.5.0, people are whining a lot about the new changes. Especially because they can't get their cosmetic items (for free!), which does absolutely nothing, besides making you look a little unique. You can still ride all the mountains, try out all the events, and you're certainly not limited by any micro-transactions gameplay-wise. You can use all the grabs, ride just as fast, and compete in just as many events as you want to - FOR FREE!This is what I would like to see in EVERY Free-to-Play game. Where you ONLY have to (optionally) pay for cosmetic items. Here in SNOW, as it is in 0.5.0, you can't pay to get BETTER. You can only look slightly 'cooler'.On a whole 'nother note, here's a few quotes by a few developers from Poppermost, the company who makes the game SNOW, regarding the new shop and the new mechanics:1. Asurao: ""We have no plans to charge you for new levels/mountains. We want everyone to be able to ride together whether they've spent money or not. This is core to the game."" and ""There will be many ways to earn credits in the future"".(>>Source<<)2. Rubadubdub!: ""I can ensure you that there will be other ways of getting new gear in the future, so you'll still be able to get pretty good gear just like in TF2, CS: GO etc.""(>>Source<<)3. Asurao: ""As we continue working towards Open Beta (0.6.0) we will be adding player progression (a leveling system) so that you can earn items without having to buy them"">>Source<<4. Asurao: ""I agree that the break-turn isn't working as intended and overall speed management feels very sporadic. We're looking into this and will make improvements in future updates.""(>>Source<<)			"

								If we assume that its early access then we can talk about future improvements. The game is full of backs starting from the menu and finishing inside the mountains. A lot of crashes for no actual reason. And another small problem is all these microtransactions. You cant buy even a new shirt without real money. BUTThis game has a great potential and can become a really successful game if the devs make it right. Graphics looks great , gameplay with some improvements can become even greater, maps are wonderful , music is cool (considering some1 is using it) and this minimalistic menu style is really cool.What needs to be done? I believe that devs must go from a free to play game with microtransactions to a priced game with no microtransactions. If they keep the game like that they have a 90% chance to fail hard. But if they fix the bugs(that they will fix , dont forget its early access) and make it a game you actually buy and then you are good to go then they will have a great success in my opinion. After all its a great idea so I will rate with 7.5/10. Ohhh and devs... Please add snowboards in the game.<3			"

								Here's the rundown:I was browsing the steam store and find this game. I thought to myself ""well, I liked SSX, and this looks pretty good"" so I downloaded it. The game was fine until I was told how to do mid-air tricks, where I would do a full 360, flip, and time jumps correctly, and I would just have to start over. The worst part is that the gameplay wasn't even close half of the time I spent on it. When I closed it, the game crashed and I was unable to exit out of the game even though all it did is make my screen black. Long story short I had to un plug my computer and I am not willing to have to do that everytime I exit the game.			"

								Do you appreciate skiing/snowboarding? Do you love games like SSX?Do you love huge open world games?Then this game is for you! SNOW is a great free-to-play game with no features of a pay to win. The only thing you can buy are extra credits which allow you to unlock extra gear (but you get these overtime anyways). The controls are fluid and very refined making it easy to learn but hard to master. There's just nothing like plowing through some fresh powder or hitting a 540 Corkscrew in first person. Only downside is you basically NEED some sort of controller to play it (mouse and keyboard ain't going to cut it) but they're pretty cheap and easy to find.			"

								As of current, SNOW is in Pre-Alpha, and as its being developed by just three people, it'll be like this for a while. SNOW is not flawless, and does have its fair share of bugs. One major flaw is that there is no audio, but one good fix I found is to have some music in the background, something fast paced, as you ski past all these rocks and obstacles that never seem to stop coming. Controls need a little bit of work, and they will arrive in due time.I honestly reccomend this game to people who like sking/winter sports, or just enjoy crashing their skier into a couple hundred obstacles.

								Snow is a very relaxing but very fun game for everyone even thoose who arent exactly into skiing like myself. One of the major problems that i think the game badly needs is AUDIO as that is a must but they are bringing this out at a later date. The game is also very immersive which adds to the experience with its beautifull visuals like the sun light creeping over the mountains really makes it feel real. One feature that i personally like alot is the in game store which has alot of licsensed merchandise that you can wear. The fact that they are bringing out multiplayer, snowboarding, audio and all the updates to come will complete this game and easily make it so much more enjoyable than what it is already. There are a few bugs which im sure will be fixed as soon as possible, ive noticed very little for an early alpha game so you should be fine theres nothing really ive seen that will ruin your experience in the game. Overall i would reccomend buying this game even though it will be free some time next year as it is still a great experience and may even interest you in theese sports. The developers have made an outstanding job keep it up guys!			"

I love the mechanics so far, with the exception of the speed of the player (feels very slow even at top speed) and that the characters look very stiff when landing an air trick or rail slide. No half-pipe and no snowboards yet, fingers crossed for next large patch.This game is going to be the best snowboarding experience since amped 1/2 and i can't wait to see whats in the next patch.

								Sadly at this time I can't recommend the game.  As a snowboarder and a huge fan of winter sports games, the controls are sluggish, the xbox controls often don't work or fail completely.  Cannot gain speed, movement feels wonky, the moves are not precise at all, etc.  This is early access so it's understandable that this will all be fixed in the future (hopefully).  I believe the potential is there for the game... it could be great with a lot of improvement.  For now, my take is skeptical at best.  Oh and they need to optimize better; my system far exceeds the recommended specs but my frame rate is as slow as molasses as well as the game itself.  I wanted to pull what little hair I have left in my head out and eventually quit before I rage quit lol.  I will give one positive comment: the music is excellent to say the least.  They picked the perfect tracks to give the down-hill experience exactly what it needs, so bravo on that account.			"

Its not a pay to win game as much as it seems to be, there are plenty of levels to access the only thing you need to really pay for is extra skis and customization for your charecter but each time you level up you get the money needed to buy what you like. overall great game highly recommend!

								Ignore the negative reviews, SNOW is an outstanding skiing game and blows other free-to-play games out of the water. SNOW has everything that makes a good game in one big package. First off the graphics look outstanding, almost as if I'm actually on a mountian. Amazing UI its basic and gets the job done. Multiplayer works and allows you to race with friends and explore the beautiful landscapes this game can offer. I am not a huge fan of skiing and I had a blast, anyone who likes a game that can offer ANY of the above should instantly download SNOW. Its free-to-play but it does not shove its microtransactions in your face. Never while I was playing did I feel forced to buy any credits as the game offers them from regular play. You have nothing to lose by giving this great game a chance and It is a project I will continue to follow and support.			"

								This game should be considered game of the decade. I've spent way more time in this game than I would like to admit, but that's because its simple controls yet tall skill ceiling, coupled with the many singleplayer maps and hilariously buggy multiplayer action keep me interested day in and day out.This game is fun to play alone, but even better with friends, especially when you turn them into tombstones in the middle of their trick combos. The physics are realistic until you begin to intimate friendly discussion with solid objects, and then all reality breaks down. There are multiple easter eggs and hidden areas deep into the Siala map that I'm still discovering.The cosmetics in this game are purely that, cosmetic. I've only managed to gain about 140 currency in the 14 levels I've put in, but you can purchase more in the store. Items range from hats worn by actual skiers and snowboarders to horse masks and knight helmets.			"

At first the handling was bad and just felt awkward, reinstalled it again toady after watching a few videos and while the graphics are slightly better, nothing much has improved and the feel of skiing just isn't there.  It feels clumsy and unituative and there is no sense of speed when skiing downhill.Try again in another few years when it is finished, but atm it is a no from the Rock and Roll God.			"

								This game is really enjoyable and ran smoothly on my pc. High quality textures and a very large draw distance. I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys skiing. This game has a big learning curve but it's really fun and has a very high replay value. (It's really hard to land tricks perfectly) The tutorial is garbage, I didn't learn anything in it and I never passed the third part where you have to land a 720 spinning jump, I don't know the button combinations. The best way is to free-play on the mountain. There are some bugs but they aren't game breaking. Sometimes I hit something and I crash and on the next run I hit the same object but it just affects my score instead of having me go back.This game has a lot of potential and is already expanse. I wish that the lifts were operational and you could ride them. I also wish that there was a map because I've gotten lost quite a few times. TL;DR = Don't buy unless you are a skiing enthusiast, just wait until it’s f2p "

								For what it is this game is awesome. I think with continued development of more mountains and more events it will be super solid. Its got good mechanics, easy to pick up but hard to master. Like all early access games it has its moments. Grinding right now is by far the most underwhelming thing in the game but the last few updates have been making it a lot better. Its no Tony Hawk ""Press X to do tricks"" its more like the Skate games where you actually had to do some prep work for your tricks, like aligning your trajectories and landing properly or death. Also, to go along with the Skate games the massive and brutal crashes make this game a total riot. Ragdolling down the mountain in this game is as funny as Goat Simulator but without the ""why am I even playing this?"" vibe. Hoping when all is said and done that snowboarding and snowmobiles are well executed and I would love to see a mountain editor. Keep up the good work devs!			"

								What is this crap?I bought this long time ago.Now i try to play again, despite having a bad feeling caused by previous playtime.And OMG nothings changed, at least not in positive way.FPS is even lower than before.I run GTA5 at High settings across surround (triple screen) 5240x1080But this game even at low settings cant reach stable 60 FPS.Within a few minutes i was down the hill from the top.The whole ride was short and not interresting at all.And what happend below the bottom?Well i found out that all detail was gone, trees floating above the ground, weird textures glitches from shading happend there, and no guidance to some spot where it would continue or stop the game.Instead i felt of the edge of the level, no timeout to send me to ground again nothing.I previously asked steam for a refund on this because i think its a scam.This game is bad.Many want it to be good (even me) but as i see it, this will never happen.This game will be a turd.And they are trying to make it shine.I think it will never be optimized, so always bad FPS.The end of level is a empty zone filled with bugs.The ragdoll effects are a joke.The whole animation is a joke...This game is a money grab.And they will grab all they can before this company will fanish in history.

								Well, when I first started playing. And I haven't been playing for long. I just saw it for it's silly ragdolls. But as I played, I saw something more beautiful. As I sped down slopes and looked around at the landscape. I was left in shock to it's beauty. I eventually learnt how to pull of amazing flips and stunts! I would dash down hills, mountains, forests, cliff faces. And do some wacky things. This game feels awesome, everyone should give it a try.Though this game isn't perfect. Our lovely developers thought it would be a good idea to put a high price on cosmetics! I would like to customize my character to as an acurate version of me in my snow gear, as possible! But Because I don't want to blow off 20 dollars, No thankyou! It would be much better if we got credits as we leveled up! Or if every run we did, we would get points for it! I get you guys need money, but this isn't a good way to do it! Also, you guys have us to buy events... And the only reason anyone would buy an event is because the item you get for getting Gold on it. I'm pretty sure you can buy the same item for less... In most cases.That was the only complaints I had. 'Tis a fun game. Try it some time! Just don't buy stuff until they make it reasonable...			"

								I'm not going to say the game is easy to get into using the Keyboard and Mouse, because it isn't. However, at the time of writting the controls are not rebindable and I dont really know the controls. Regardless, this game has huge potential. The mountain is beautiful and it is extremely apparent that the Devs are actually putting time and effort into this game. It has everything one could want from an open world skiing (and eventaully boarding) game. You can smash some tricks in the terrain park, shred some knar in the various backcountries, and throw yourself off of giant dams after spending half an hour bunny hopping to the ledge on concrete.

								SNOW is a free to play skiing simulator that is absolutely BADASS.From the 7 hours I have played of this game, I am throughly enjoyed. PC has never gotten a skiing/snowboarding game ever and this game is the perfect way to start. Graphics:Absolutely beautiful. Best graphics I have seen in a very long time and it is also coded amazingly. I can run the game on Ultra at 60 fps and my computer really isn't that good.Movements:As of right now, you can tell the movements they have now are place holders. The body is very stiff and moves more like a robot. You can tell by the movements that the game is still in early beta. Obviously the ragdoll is terrible, but none the less is really funny waatching your guy flop down the hill with a few broken bones and a twisted neck.Music/Sounds:Adrian Blood.. What can I say? The music is amazing. It's the perfect feel of chill and EDM. If I was to go skiing one day, this will be the music I listen to. The sounds are high quality and match with the game very well.Maps:Perfectly designed. The most of the maps on the game are based off of real places.What I Would Like To See:Snowboards! We know they are coming and it will be awesome when they come. Map Creator! It would be awesome making your own tracks and having races on the tracks you make with your friends.Custom Graphics! Would be so cool to make your own clothing and make your own designs on the skis.Do I recommend this game? HELL YEAH!It's free to play! If you want to buy clothing and other in game stuff, better fork out some big bucks because the cheapest thing is $5 for 500 in game coins that can buy you a jacket, pants, gloves, and a mask. None the less, all the tracks are free and its free to play multiplayer.Cons:Super expensive and hard to earn coins.(I got for leveling up to level 5 10 coins. 10 coins can't buy me anything in the game. The cheapest thing in the game is 89 coins and its a damn party hat.)Summary: Super fun! Great graphics! Great music! HUNDREDS of items to choose from! Can't buy♥♥♥♥♥♥ I RECOMMEND!			"

								I was really looking forward to playing this game, at first it was kind've disappointing as my expectations were too high for a game that hasn't been fully released yet. But i still believed this game could go places. Less than 24 hours after owning this game it had an update, Everything looked sleeker and more professional and it started to get my hopes up, until i tried to join a game and i recieved a loading screen that never goes away.  Rendering the game useless.To top that off you will be paying £6.99 for a game which you can wait til the 28th for and recieve more or less exactly the same game. I would advise against buying this game at this moment in time.			"

								I'm not going to say the game is easy to get into using the Keyboard and Mouse, because it isn't. However, at the time of writting the controls are not rebindable and I dont really know the controls. Regardless, this game has huge potential. The mountain is beautiful and it is extremely apparent that the Devs are actually putting time and effort into this game. It has everything one could want from an open world skiing (and eventaully boarding) game. You can smash some tricks in the terrain park, shred some knar in the various backcountries, and throw yourself off of giant dams after spending half an hour bunny hopping to the ledge on concrete.

								I was like ""early access game like Steep, alright, $60 saved!""Then I find out it's been ""released"" for three years.  My snowboard keeps clipping below the snow, very annoying.  Controls, especially jumping and doing tricks are just terrible and feel clunky.  Not to mention the slopes are boring and Multiplayer is a disorganized ghost town.I'd just wait for Steep to go on sale if you want shredding done right.			"

								Very well made game, but I have a few complaints as hardware goes. 1. It uses 68.7% of my CPU, 2. over 500mb of RAM, and 32.4% disk. Please fix these errors. Other than that I would recommend this game to anyone who has a good PC.			"

								Writing a quick review for this game,I have never been Skiing or Snowboarding more than the occasional outback adventure so this game was refreshing to my childhood, like playing SSX Tricky, at first.Honestly it gets dull, even after 30 minutes I felt I had seen most of what the game had to offer, if it was free and thats what you're into then do it, but this is a bit too uninteractive for my taste right now,Still a good game and runs fantastic!

								Well, when I first started playing. And I haven't been playing for long. I just saw it for it's silly ragdolls. But as I played, I saw something more beautiful. As I sped down slopes and looked around at the landscape. I was left in shock to it's beauty. I eventually learnt how to pull of amazing flips and stunts! I would dash down hills, mountains, forests, cliff faces. And do some wacky things. This game feels awesome, everyone should give it a try.Though this game isn't perfect. Our lovely developers thought it would be a good idea to put a high price on cosmetics! I would like to customize my character to as an acurate version of me in my snow gear, as possible! But Because I don't want to blow off 20 dollars, No thankyou! It would be much better if we got credits as we leveled up! Or if every run we did, we would get points for it! I get you guys need money, but this isn't a good way to do it! Also, you guys have us to buy events... And the only reason anyone would buy an event is because the item you get for getting Gold on it. I'm pretty sure you can buy the same item for less... In most cases.That was the only complaints I had. 'Tis a fun game. Try it some time! Just don't buy stuff until they make it reasonable...			"

								Snow is a great game if you love skiing or just love exploring nature in winter. I purchased this game back in April 2014 for $15 and am glad to spend $15 to support a game like this, well worth the money, even better now cause it's free. If you want a game that makes you feel like you are skiing then this game is the game for you. Great environment.			"

								What is this crap?I bought this long time ago.Now i try to play again, despite having a bad feeling caused by previous playtime.And OMG nothings changed, at least not in positive way.FPS is even lower than before.I run GTA5 at High settings across surround (triple screen) 5240x1080But this game even at low settings cant reach stable 60 FPS.Within a few minutes i was down the hill from the top.The whole ride was short and not interresting at all.And what happend below the bottom?Well i found out that all detail was gone, trees floating above the ground, weird textures glitches from shading happend there, and no guidance to some spot where it would continue or stop the game.Instead i felt of the edge of the level, no timeout to send me to ground again nothing.I previously asked steam for a refund on this because i think its a scam.This game is bad.Many want it to be good (even me) but as i see it, this will never happen.This game will be a turd.And they are trying to make it shine.I think it will never be optimized, so always bad FPS.The end of level is a empty zone filled with bugs.The ragdoll effects are a joke.The whole animation is a joke...This game is a money grab.And they will grab all they can before this company will fanish in history.

Snow is a great F2P skiing/ snowboarding simulator, reminiscent of the Skate franchise. It features both singleplayer and multiplayer game modes, with a healthy community to play around with.  Graphically the game is gorgeous! It uses the CryEngine, which allows advanced options for configuration. The neverending mountains really are a treat for the eye here, folks.  You'll also be skiing down the slopes, listening to the euphoric ambient music, accompanying you through the hills. Snow also offers you some nice, relaxing custom tracks to soothe you. It's a surprise how well the controls handle! Even when using a keyboard, the controls are easy to get the hang of and master. Rarely do they cause problems. It's nice to know that the game supports gamepads, too. Snow offers natural character progression. It's quite simple - the more you play, the better you get. There is a variety of character customization options, you can be decked out from head to toes. These cosmetic items do require in-game purchases, but you can obtain credits for them through playing. As a third option, there is always the communtiy market. Only remarks. While everything else is great, the physics need some refining. There are some awkward moments with the character movement and object collision. Grinding, in particular, is terrible. While the developers have given us a product of high quality, Snow falls a little short of being the next big thing, for the moment at least.			"

								It is not a bad idea for a ski game. Though as it is in beta still this game a bit broken. I do enjoy some of the glitches as they make me laugh. Like when you biff the rag doll physics just are too unrealistic. often my character's head would keep rolling and rolling. The controls are a little bit wonky and events don't seem to work when I have tried. I will look at this game more when it gets another update.As the game is now, I can not recommend it. I am hoping that I can in the future.			"

								Let me start by saying THANK YOU for not creating an SSX.  But...So far, this game still isn't at par with most simulator type skiing\snowboarding games that have already been on the market.  The character is stiff, weightless, and too obviously procedurally driven.  It looks and feels like you are controlling the skiis not the rider.  The controls are very binary when they should take advantage of modern analog controllers. For instance, regardless if you tap the steering controls or hold, the character drops right into the extremity of the turning poses.  Same for grabs and any other feedback coming from the character. There is no sense of speed unless you are in the trees. The levels feel wide open, flat, and tricking opportunities are sparse. The jumps in the parks feel dauntingly huge and are seemingly too big for the lack of speed even at max speed.   The physics feel just as binary as the controls and don't work well with the level design metrics for the terrain or park obstacles.  Rails riding is quirky and the rider looks dorky. Halfpipe riding is frustrating and it's nearly impossible to get any speed\air.  The radgoll is just broken, and bailing in any game other than EA Skate isn't fun. It's punishing and wastes a players time.  The best parts of this game are the jump on the right thumbstick (thank you EA Skate) when it works and doesn't give you an awkward emote instead. As well, a huge plus is having the generous ability to customize the ingame camera.  This game has a long way to go before Beta.			"

How can this game have 70% recommends? Is it acceptable to have terrible stiff control in a SKIING GAME? And i didnt even get to the cosmetics.

Early Access Review
								This  game is fun. I missed all the ""extreme"" sports games that the consoles used to have. Games like 1080 Avalanche and Tony Hawk Pro Skater always had a nice mix of sick tricks and groovy clothing options that always allowed for a fun time. This game has both and its doing it in the right direction.For start, this game is in early access and there are plenty of bugs. With this aside, the dev team is working hard to make the gameplay mechanics, such as the actual movement and physics, extremely polished. As of right now, the skiing elements feel as they should. You are now wondering, ""hey bruh, wut bout my snowboard?! I want to be the next Dion Blaster....errr Ricky Winterboard...."" As of right now the devs are currently working on the skiing mechanics alone; focusing all their efforts before transitioning to snowboards. While this may seem upsetting, I will remphasize that the skiis are nicely done. This aspect should not deter you from giving this game a try.The game itself is centered around a few areas and one giant mountain that people can skii around. This I feel is the best aspect of the game. Every location feels new.  Any path you travel lacks the strategically placed fallen tree or mountain face that forces you to go in any given direction. While there are paths to follow, there is nothing stopping you from carving your own trail.The game itself looks awsome too. I dont know how hard it was to paint a mountain white, but it is incredibly satisfying to look around while skiing. With this in mind, The dev team is supporting the occulus rift, which is a step in the right direction. I often put myself in first person mood to get a better immersion while going down the mountainside and the rift will probably provide a better experience. I guess the only ""downside"" to this game, which isnt really a bad thing, is that this game will be F2P. The game will charge the players for buying different clothing. Who are they to tell me that I have to wear clothes..... pff!This will be a more mature version of the ""extreme"" sports I used to enjoy on the consoles. Knowing this, I cant wait to take all the skill I learned in SNOW and apply it to real skiing.....			"

Early Access Review
								I've put in 14hours in this game just as something to do when Im bored or need a break from work, and I have a very mixed opinion on it, while I actually love the way it feels and handles a lot of people seem to dislike it, I just think it a little to realistict (other than crash physics) for people to get comfortable with right away, which IMO is a good problem to have, since I started I went from not being able to control myself going down hillstso seeing how much points I can rack up in a single run. However it's progression that destroys this game and I get it this is free to play there has to be something that makes players want to spend some money on the game and in most cases f2p games use vanity items to incite a purchase but I've never had a game feel so restrictive charater design wise just to get you to pay for it, you start with literally zero options to customize your character with all the shop items costing more than what you have, with earning more money almost out of the question, for example, after almost twenty level up's I've earned around 150 or less of the in game currency  which around the cost of a single item in game. I've try'd in game events to win money and got nothing, and some times even the level ups give you a fast travel marker instead or absolutly nothing at all, so really it feels like the game is going no where. Another part of the games still very lacking is the maps you can play on though far more forgivable with the game still being so new its hard to get excited when you know they're gonna cost in game currency just to open, and we already know thats impossible to get a substancial amount without buying it.  I think that it's sad they're trying so hard to force players to pay them for a full expirence when we constantly see F2P games being wildly SUCCESFUL BECAUSE PEOPLE CHOOSE to pay money for small perks like exp boosts and skins etc... and  FAIL BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE FORCED to pay for a full expirience. So IMO this game will inevitably fail if this isn't fixed and for now im not going to recommend this game maybe down the line my opinion will change.			"

								 This game is great. If you're a fan of the skate series you'll love this. This game balances realistic and super fictional skiing just right.  SNOW looks great visually, but I wish there were more snow particle effects. I have nothing bad to say about the controls, they're just fine the way they are. If you decide to try this game out remember it's still early access and there's still that has to be added to the game. I'll edit this review with some more information later.To all the early access player complaining about the new update.You payed for alpha acess and the alpha items, not for the rest of the clothing options. They made it pretty clear thats what you would receive , and you recieved it. Nothing more, nothing less. They do care about the people who funded their work, they gave us more than two weeks to play before anyone else could. We all knew it would be F2P and they'd have to make money somehow. And besides, all this 'Exclusive Content' is purely cosmetic, it doesn't affect gameplay at all. If you don't want to spend money buying the gear, wait untill they add their progress system. You'll be able to unlock stuff that way. They respond to A LOT of the questions and feedback given by the community, and take them into account. Poppermost is one of the best dev teams I've ever seen. "

								Well I bought this game near the start of early access process.  I began and it was a very enjoyable, arcade style skiing game.  I admired that they weren't afraid to try something new.  After M2 was released however, I noticed things were changing (no duh its still in development), but the changes weren't positive.  The ability to do almost anything in the air or on a rail was pretty much gone.  I went from triple corking to barely doing a single cork.   Of course I thought that this was to be expected so I stopped playing it for about 4 months.  Now M4 is being released soon and I thought I'd give it another go.  I think it is worse than the last time I played it.  I am getting severe lagging, the gfx are brutal (worse than I remembered) the physics are crazy.  Still can't do much for tricks.  The preload system is severly flawed, it seldom works like it is suppose to.  Not to mention the devs are devolping a PS4 version of the game.  Like WTF!  The computer version is hardly playable and yet they are doing a ps4 version as well.  Long story short.  DONT BUY THIS GAME NOW!  Maybe in a year or two it will be playable and enjoyable but right now it isnt!			"

								Absolutely TERRIBLE controls. You spend most of your time spam pressing W (or X on a controller) to gain speed that you don't even have enough time to line up a jump or rail. If you decide NOT to tuck or spam W for speed, you literally cant make it over the jump. Graphics are great, and the UI is fantastically simple. The controls are so terrible that even looking at a half pipe is a joke. Uninstalling this until they totally revamp their controls.			"

								I normally don't like to review early access games but this one just needs a bump in the help department.The menu UI has delayed response when navigating. Even with a good pc that I have it still seemed underwater. Which leads me to the gameplay. Can I get some crack for my snowboarder? I feel like I could walk backwards in skiis faster than the speed you have on the slopes, you just don't get enough to build up for a jump. Approacing a ramp or rail the jump doesn't seem to work in relation to where your location is.  Looking for that burst to leap onto the rail it doesn't work. The tutorial is busted. I get to where you have to preform basic grabs and a 360. Everything works fine but checking off the basic grab results in reset after reset. It says to hold LB or RB for a basic grab however upon doing that it does not register I have done the grab. During free roam can we defualt replays to off? Its too easy to get stuck trying to get out of it. Also most players will be on a keyboard or an xbox controller, yet during the controls screen you obviously display a ps4 controller. Not saying gamers don't use that controller, just seems weird to display the ps4 controller yet tell me to jump with A and the other xbox specific buttons.The graphics will do for what they are. It is kind of hard to imagine this is the cryengine at work.Incorporate some really nice ragdoll physics and boost the speed up 10x and this can be really fun and enjoyable.I desperately have been wanting a good shredding snowboarding game that was quality. I will keep my eye on this title, just seems a lot more technical issues are still being tweaked. Thank you for allowing me to test your game. I will check back when the speed of the game is increased.			"

								Ok, i find it really nice that it's free and the game got potentional. It can be the PC version of a good open world winter action sport game. The music in the game is also decent, i found that to be one of the pros of the game. However that said, this game is just anoying in every turn. The controls are really bad. It feels unnatural and uncontrolleble, and i can't figure out why they made the controls so weird for PC. We got a mouse, it's not that difficult to make use of it in a better way than what they have. For a game that sells on good physics, it isn't that good. it's glitching and going crazy all the time. There are little to non ragdolls effects. I mean come on, the ragdoll effect is what makes a game like this really fun, and it's just not there. You feel really slow when trying to gain speed aswell. Often i found myself trying to get as much speed as possible, then realize i didn't get enough for a high jump. There are anoying menus all over the place that dosn't help you. It just takes up time and makes you wonder why they made it like that. If you fail a part of a quest, do they ask if you want to restart the part of the quest? Nope, they let you ride to the finish line knowing that you can't complete it all without restarting everything. I can also smell micro transaction a mile away in the finished product. And the game isn't stable, but hey. It's beta so that's expected. For a free game in beta that got potentional, i would give it 5/10 for now. They need a lot of fixing to make this a good game in my opinion.			"

Obviously there are some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bugs and sadly no snowboard yet which is weird since it's been in development so long it makes you wonder if it will take another 2 years to make the snowboards.			"

								This game just didn't do it for me. I played this game hoping for a cure when the steep open beta ended but I was unsurprisingly disappointed. I played the steep beta for 3 hours in one sitting and was sad when I had to shut it down unlike snow whitch had me angry at the cliping that abruptly ended my runs and the janky controls (yes I did also try with a controller), and I was also disappointed with how hard it pushed my computer with how graphically lacking it was. I was happy to end my stream of rage and shut this down and never touch it again. But I do have to say, I didn't spend a dime on this game so that's the only good thing about this game in my opinion.			"

								When I was a child I used to play some SSX on the PS2 (that Snowboard game). And since then I hoped for a realistic skiing simulator. And now its here! And even if it is in Beta it is already pretty perfect in my opinion. If you get used to the controls there is nothing that can stop you from stomping awesome tricks. The landscape looks awesome and is also very realistic. All in all I rate this game 95/100. Its super chill, super fun and super ...

								While it looks like it would be a ton of fun to play, this ain't no SSX...in the Sims.Playing with keyboard and mouse, I found it basically impossible to get any amount of speed built up in order to do anything even remotely resembling what the tutorial wanted me to do, much less anything that might actually be fun. I struggled to complete the tutorial, and eventually ragequit. I came back to it this evening and mucked about with the FreeRide mode on a couple different mountains. Downhill was fun, if pointless, and the mountain with halfpipes, etc, was fun for about 5 minutes before succumbing to ""no-fun-itis"" again...and again, because I couldn't find (an intuitive) way to get any speed to use for tricks on the various grind rails and ramps.

								I understand why this game is widely praised, but, to put it simply, playing this game Vanilla is impossible. It's the most pay-2-play game I've ever played, and I'm highly experienced in mobile games.Let's tell a story.I was playing this game and was having a bit of fun, but decided to try another sport out. It was snowmobile. It didn't work. No error message, no HUD popup, nothing. So I pause and go into the menu. I see there's a snowmobile section in the buy menu, so i click it. Everything is gone, there's nothing there. I do a bit of searching come to find out it's just under 5 dollars to pay for the unlock, and just under one dollar to pay for the snowmobile itself, not to mention it's not even there.It's $1.00 USD PLUS for cosmetic items, which makes no sense to me, but I really don't care about cosmetics. Doesn't matter.What matters is content. Release the snowmobile for free instead of for 5 dollars. This is still a money-grabbing ♥♥♥♥♥ of a game. Maybe when it's out of Early Access and it's a couple dollars for everything, I'll play this game, but when they have unfixable bugs in the game, it's terrible. This includes being permanently windowed, buggy controls, and if you're serious about this type of game, don't play. It's just a major glitchfest, and that's the only reason it's fun. The rewind controls are♥♥♥♥♥♥unless you have a controller. The regular controls are♥♥♥♥♥♥unless you have a controller. Don't get this game; free or not, it's not even worth your human will or the time to install it. Buy STEEP. Seriously.I do not reccomend. Not at all.			"

There are also a lot of the ""planned"" features missing at this stage but that is VERY normal for an alpha.. this is a true alpha where the major portions of the game are still being developed and only 10 to 20 percent of content is in the game, that is enough for the testing of the game.Having said all of that, I've found my multiple plays of the game satisfying and enjoyable. The core game is playable but of course those who are wanting more than essentially a tech demo, you should stay away until it is developed some more. It is going to be free2play as well, so if you can wait till later this year, you can get it for free.			"

								Broken mess. Menus don't work correctly no matter what I try. Tutorial randomly fails at certain times. Cannot launch the game without it offering me to play the tutorial. Clicking no doesn't work. Game launches automatically in the smallest resolution possible and windowed. Changing it sometimes crashes it. I've barely managed to squeeze 15 minutes of gameplay out of this and honestly cannot be bothered to keep trying to do so.From what I've seen of the game otherwise, it looks good. If these issues were ironed out, I'm certain it'd be a good game. I don't have the heart to thumbs it down, either, seeing how ambitious this is. I'll give it another go sometime.			"

								I would've recommended the game about a month ago, and to be honest i did to a bunch of friends of me. I enjoyed this game thoroughly and liked the freeform, freestyle gameplay of it and the (relatively) good graphics and gameplay were a treat to experience.Unfortunately after the latest update i can no longer recommend this game to anybody. Not that the addition of snowboards and snowmobiles aren't nice, on the contrary (waited for a long time for those). But the whole ""pushing forward"" motion to get around on skis is broken, so that you now only can tuck, making the whole process of starting your run down the mountain pretty tedious. YOu will be sliding down the first part of the run at about a mile per hour for the first 10 minutes before you actually make some speed and pushing youself a small bit up a slope is completely making every run slow and boring. Too bad, because the previously mentioned additions (though hidden behind microtransactions) are really cool. Too bad, man.			"

								I know this is 'Early Access'... but it's lifeless and dull. The lighting is non-existent, the sense of speed completely absent. There's hardly any particle effects of snow, wind or any feel of different types of snow or ice. Considering the game is called SNOW.. you'd expect it to at least feature some snow?!The Animations are placeholder and poorly blended, on top of this the characters are lifeless and devoid of charcater.The text rendering is horrible.Sound isn't working at all (at least on my machine anyway)Admittedly, I played this on Keyboard, so it's going to be flawed.. but come on, the controls are crap!I'd suggest you guys get yourselves a PS one and play Cool boarders... down tools trying to make it look better, and work out the physics... as far as i can tell you're just as fast down-hill as you are up, there's no feeling of sliding on snow at all.. I know game dev isn't easy guys, and this must have taken a while to get here, but seriously... I'd pull this and come back when you're happy with it.. because, well.. you can't be pleased with this! Also, just a tip... hire someone do light the level properly, or at least purchase a unity licence that'll let you proper lighting.. it's grey and lifeless at the moment.. ask yourselves: Why do people ski?FUN! - Your game isn't fun...

Early access means it came out BEFORE it was finished with bug patchings, and game polishing and all that. Eat a sausage if you expect it to be perfect.			"

								Dont let the good reviews fool you. This game is trash.So there is no mid us servers so if you live in like Texas you have to deal with 100+ ping.Everything about this game is terrible. You crash in flat areas. You crash on ares where you should be allowed to ramp. when you crash, your guy dosen't fall down and get himself back up, he gets marked my a tombstone like he died. I will crash when my guy hits a 5 foot jump sideways and die? Why wont you just be allowed to get back up and try again? The manuvering (say when your jumping) is so SLOOWWW... There isnt even much areas where you can get up high enough to do a flip and actully land it. Might as well taken out that feature entirely. And once you ""die"" you can't get placed at the top of the mountain again. You have to spawn on someone like your playing battlefield and sometimes they could be at the top, but other times there just finishing. Why couldent that be just an option? Why couldent you just spawn at the top? There are so many obstacles on the slopes that wouldent be there in real life ski resorts. Why is there a giant rock arch in the middle of a slope? Are we in snowy Arizona or something? And when you hit one thats like a ramp shape which you should be able to go off (a lot of these are smooth, curved, and looks like they were delibretly placed there to be a ramp) you cant go over! You crash and ""die"" by hitting a small rock formation thats shaped like a ramp. This game is terrible and I can't belive how many people like it.			"

								Beautiful graphics, thanks to the CryEngine, fluid trick control and a lot of future potential. There are currently no objectives, so don't purchase this game unless you can have fun just skiing around a mountain with your own music playing. (Which I love doing) Also don't purchase this game if you want snowboarding, the devs have said many times that snowboarding will be included later on in devemopment. The game has improved a lot since I purchased it, and will only continue to be better, and will no doubt be one of the best skiing/snowboarding games.			"

Early Access Review
								For casual fans of winter sports, this game checks all the boxes- X Games tie-in, big tricks, and lots of licensed brands. But for the real winter sport athletes- this game sucks.After snowboarding for close to 10 years now, I think I can make comment on how unrealisitic and inconsistent the collisions are in this game. Whenever I crashed into the orange safety netting, instead of being tied up or slowed down by it, I was bounced off of it like a rubber ball, and hurled over the chair lift tower.If you clip a rock with the tail of your board, you aren't spun around or lose balance mid air and crash. You are instead ejected out of your bindings and thrown.Landing on flat surfaces is hyper inconsistent. You could launch a jump 3 times the exact same way, land in the same spot, and get three diferent outcomes.And from time to time, when you do an event that starts you in a timing house, you can get stuck when you try to push out and crash immediately. And also, you would think that with this many brands neing licesnsed, you would get a bigger pool of starting gear. WRONG. You have no helmet, no goggles, and one choice for everything else. The only way to get more gear is by running through and completing events, or microtransactions. (I would normally be fine with microtransactions, but only if the game gave you incentives to buy items - like CSGO and Rocket League crates)But hey, if you like running through the same slopestyle course 20 times because you keep crashing in the gate house, this is for you.

								Dont let the good reviews fool you. This game is trash.So there is no mid us servers so if you live in like Texas you have to deal with 100+ ping.Everything about this game is terrible. You crash in flat areas. You crash on ares where you should be allowed to ramp. when you crash, your guy dosen't fall down and get himself back up, he gets marked my a tombstone like he died. I will crash when my guy hits a 5 foot jump sideways and die? Why wont you just be allowed to get back up and try again? The manuvering (say when your jumping) is so SLOOWWW... There isnt even much areas where you can get up high enough to do a flip and actully land it. Might as well taken out that feature entirely. And once you ""die"" you can't get placed at the top of the mountain again. You have to spawn on someone like your playing battlefield and sometimes they could be at the top, but other times there just finishing. Why couldent that be just an option? Why couldent you just spawn at the top? There are so many obstacles on the slopes that wouldent be there in real life ski resorts. Why is there a giant rock arch in the middle of a slope? Are we in snowy Arizona or something? And when you hit one thats like a ramp shape which you should be able to go off (a lot of these are smooth, curved, and looks like they were delibretly placed there to be a ramp) you cant go over! You crash and ""die"" by hitting a small rock formation thats shaped like a ramp. This game is terrible and I can't belive how many people like it.			"

								This game has a lot of potential but at the moment I wouldnt recommend that you play it. The mechanics are kind of bad on the keyboard and what can kill you while playing is really really stupid. What I suggest the creators do if they want people to play is make the controls better and the mechanics of the player or character better because he is really slow and it makes the gameplay not look smooth like most games should be. Also the maps need more because to be honest they are plain and have nothing really on them to do. Basically what im trying to say is upgrade EVERYTHING and add things to the game what people may find interesting. Im not hating on this game because like I said it has potential but I really think it needs improving. P.S It crashes alot. 5/10 Please make this game better for the enjoyable hours people may spend on it. I rather play SSX on PS2 which came out in 2000 which has better mechanics than this. Also it would be fun to add snowboarding into it because most people prefer it.			"

The thing is, even though it did get more and more content over the time, the pleassure of playing went completely lost.A shame to say, but its horrible menu just kills the fun.I don't want to restart every 5 secs in the game by pressing tons of buttons using the mouse again.I'd love to see the gameplay improve in any way, but so far it just went down the hill...Please, please, please don't make it look fency, make it playable.

								Beautiful graphics, thanks to the CryEngine, fluid trick control and a lot of future potential. There are currently no objectives, so don't purchase this game unless you can have fun just skiing around a mountain with your own music playing. (Which I love doing) Also don't purchase this game if you want snowboarding, the devs have said many times that snowboarding will be included later on in devemopment. The game has improved a lot since I purchased it, and will only continue to be better, and will no doubt be one of the best skiing/snowboarding games.			"

								I've got this game since it's on steam early access, first it took ages to get the snowboarding in it, was promes long before. but now it's out and I finally tested it, I think it's to slow, if you mess up the landing of a trick you end up stand still and will have to push for ages before you regain some speed.. even then speed sensations is not good at all.the tricks are ok to executes, the rotation are difficult to control, you often spin without controlling the velocity and style.far to many rocks on a slope... ok this is suppose to be a mountain in the Alps, but common ! there is not fast enough response from the controls to avoid collisions and collision are to easy, any small clipping will end up with bad crash, impossible to recover.graphics look ok..ish, don't get me wrong this is good looking, but when you see title like Steep coming out fall 2016... ! I think Snow took to long to come to the stage of development it is now and it feels clumsy  with the controls, the trail of the snow from the back of the player while in normal camera looks glitchy, your snowboard or skis will just dives in the terrain... I do still recommend it, as it still quite fun, but could really do with some big inprovements with speed and controls			"

								- Broken Menues- Takes 2 minutes to load a map (16gb memory, core I5, gtx750 ti)- The ride just doesn´t feel awesome like expected. It more feels like an unfished Tony Hawk game in the snow that got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by a mexican gang on a warm summer night.- Also game crashed after 15minutes playing.Not good at all so far and definitelly not worth the purchase yet.When will I learn to never buy a game in early access anymore?

								This game needs a tremendous amount of work put into it it. This game in its current state is extremely bare bones with only 3 mountains only one of which you is for free riding the other two are small parks. The graphics on this game are beautiful though that is one of the positives. The fluidity of the gameplay is pretty smooth but that is negated by the lack of a good free riding mountain with very little jumping off points to do many tricks and at the bottom there is no end you just find yourself stuck on flat ground. I cannot recommend anybody buying this game in its current state, and by looking at the devs timeline of features they would have in this game by now they are very far behind which makes me question how seriously they are developing this game. This game has great promise, but that is all dependant on whether or not you believe the developers to be putting our money back into developing this game.			"

								Snow is the winner of our up and coming game for 2016. It is a game that takes me back to playing the SSX games when I was younger. unfourtnatly it wasn't the only Skiing game of 2016 with Steep being released right at the end of the year. I think that Snow is a visualy beautiful game with tonnes of great features. The pay for content of course I object to and I have noticed that the shadows sometimes glitch but other than those two small points I think Snow is a very solid game.			"

								Don't buy, super rough right now. NO SOUND.  When it comes out though, and is cleaned up, this game will truly be something talk about.  Not a lot of skiing/snowboarding games out there, and this looks more like 'Amped' than 'SSX'. Hold off on buying, but get it later for sure.			"

								Awesome so far, it's core is there and feels amazing.  This game is HEAVILY alpha though and honestly doesn't really belong in the store in it's state.  I have no problems being an early adopter at the sale price, but I think many will be very turned off to spend money on it's current state.  Just my thoughts on the matter.  I'd think running a kickstarter would have been a much more honest way at funding the development if that is the goal for having it on the store already.			"

								This is going to be a fantastic game when complete. And thats the main thing here, its not complete. So if you dont have the patience to watch a game develop, which at this point in time doesnt even have sound, then just wait untill its released.Its fun now, but there is no real game so to speak. Just an open mountain which you can ski around. This gets boring after not to much time. Also the controls and player need refinement, but I am confident these guys can do it :)Its in my top 5 of games im really excited about though :)			"

								For casual fans of winter sports, this game checks all the boxes- X Games tie-in, big tricks, and lots of licensed brands. But for the real winter sport athletes- this game sucks.After snowboarding for close to 10 years now, I think I can make comment on how unrealisitic and inconsistent the collisions are in this game. Whenever I crashed into the orange safety netting, instead of being tied up or slowed down by it, I was bounced off of it like a rubber ball, and hurled over the chair lift tower.If you clip a rock with the tail of your board, you aren't spun around or lose balance mid air and crash. You are instead ejected out of your bindings and thrown.Landing on flat surfaces is hyper inconsistent. You could launch a jump 3 times the exact same way, land in the same spot, and get three diferent outcomes.And from time to time, when you do an event that starts you in a timing house, you can get stuck when you try to push out and crash immediately. And also, you would think that with this many brands neing licesnsed, you would get a bigger pool of starting gear. WRONG. You have no helmet, no goggles, and one choice for everything else. The only way to get more gear is by running through and completing events, or microtransactions. (I would normally be fine with microtransactions, but only if the game gave you incentives to buy items - like CSGO and Rocket League crates)But hey, if you like running through the same slopestyle course 20 times because you keep crashing in the gate house, this is for you.

								Controls seem simple and basic but nothing seems fluid about the movements much less executing tricks, etc correctly. At a certain point its like SSX on the consoles way back when ( I don't recall when those were anymore) with the way your jump/tricks go but they want to be serious about what you are doing. You can't have both as it ends being executed poorly.Graphics don't seem terrible and I have everything set to max. The does crash as others have mentioned when you try and exit. It appears it has frozen but eventually you get a windows screen to close or wait....or bring up the task manager.It is free so you can try which I did and the reviews were mostly positive then....now with more trying the game, the reviews are going negative as it now says mixed.

								Horrible. So much potential lost. This may be just because i have windows 10, but the screen starts small, and all of the options are so hard to read, even after i figurd out how to make it fullscreen, because it's so blurry. When i started, everything was black, except for the sky,which was black with stars. This made it basically impossible to see. Don't waste your time like I did.			"

								The first thing you should ask yourself is why do i want to buy this. This question will determine if this game is worth the money or not. If you want a in depth game with a ton of content that is streamlined and explained well then this isnt for you... at all. The game is tricky to understand and does not feel familar to skate or tony hawk fans. While the controls work well, they could have been much better. a recommondation would be to make it like skate's right analog stick for tricks and jumping while a boosts your speed. Lets talk about speed. Going fast and pulling off a tough trick is the best part about this game. However there are times when you only go about 50 kps and those parts are monotonous to say the best. The biggest problem is you cant even go faster in these parts, you are pretty much capped at 50. Anyways no sound also is a HUGE dissapointment. This game once sound is added will be very relaxing. I guess until then just use spotify. Even though I dont recommend it i still enjoy this game and am looking forward to see it progress			"

								The only cons I could find are:UI is kinda broken, especially after crashing. Controller has no pause button (?)Game's unoptimized as all hell. My CPU temperature reached 64°C. Prime95 could only push it up to 58-59°C after 24 hours. GPU was also pushed to 73°C, 72°C being the highest it ever reached. Still, it runs really well.There's really no tutorial. Either that or the game forgot to explain me how to play.One time I landed so hard the game literally froze.Still, this could (and probably will) be SSX's spiritual successor. "

								This game has a lot of potential but at the moment I wouldnt recommend that you play it. The mechanics are kind of bad on the keyboard and what can kill you while playing is really really stupid. What I suggest the creators do if they want people to play is make the controls better and the mechanics of the player or character better because he is really slow and it makes the gameplay not look smooth like most games should be. Also the maps need more because to be honest they are plain and have nothing really on them to do. Basically what im trying to say is upgrade EVERYTHING and add things to the game what people may find interesting. Im not hating on this game because like I said it has potential but I really think it needs improving. P.S It crashes alot. 5/10 Please make this game better for the enjoyable hours people may spend on it. I rather play SSX on PS2 which came out in 2000 which has better mechanics than this. Also it would be fun to add snowboarding into it because most people prefer it.			"

								I've got this game since it's on steam early access, first it took ages to get the snowboarding in it, was promes long before. but now it's out and I finally tested it, I think it's to slow, if you mess up the landing of a trick you end up stand still and will have to push for ages before you regain some speed.. even then speed sensations is not good at all.the tricks are ok to executes, the rotation are difficult to control, you often spin without controlling the velocity and style.far to many rocks on a slope... ok this is suppose to be a mountain in the Alps, but common ! there is not fast enough response from the controls to avoid collisions and collision are to easy, any small clipping will end up with bad crash, impossible to recover.graphics look ok..ish, don't get me wrong this is good looking, but when you see title like Steep coming out fall 2016... ! I think Snow took to long to come to the stage of development it is now and it feels clumsy  with the controls, the trail of the snow from the back of the player while in normal camera looks glitchy, your snowboard or skis will just dives in the terrain... I do still recommend it, as it still quite fun, but could really do with some big inprovements with speed and controls			"

								Beautiful graphics, thanks to the CryEngine, fluid trick control and a lot of future potential. There are currently no objectives, so don't purchase this game unless you can have fun just skiing around a mountain with your own music playing. (Which I love doing) Also don't purchase this game if you want snowboarding, the devs have said many times that snowboarding will be included later on in devemopment. The game has improved a lot since I purchased it, and will only continue to be better, and will no doubt be one of the best skiing/snowboarding games.			"

								Super fun game! Although it is in early alpha, it is very promising. Tons of good spots to ski, but not snowboard yet (either they have not added snowboards yet or I cannot find out how to use them), and a lot of general nice things. There is no sound yet but the game is KILLER. Get it.10/10			"

Many buttons don't work and the one thing that i really hated was that you couldnt change graphics quality and hihhger than it already was, at medium. The skiis don't even change the snow, like you would expect.

								DO NOT BUY.  I originally bought this game in the summer of 2014. At the time it was fairly entertaining but had room to improve. Over a year has gone by and the only thing that has happened is the game has gotten worse with a terrible physics engine. They lured me into purchasing the game with the hopes that it was very close to the final product. All they have done is regress the playing experience and still are in the developing process. I love skiing but do not buy this game under any circumstances.			"

								This game has a lot of potential but at the moment I wouldnt recommend that you play it. The mechanics are kind of bad on the keyboard and what can kill you while playing is really really stupid. What I suggest the creators do if they want people to play is make the controls better and the mechanics of the player or character better because he is really slow and it makes the gameplay not look smooth like most games should be. Also the maps need more because to be honest they are plain and have nothing really on them to do. Basically what im trying to say is upgrade EVERYTHING and add things to the game what people may find interesting. Im not hating on this game because like I said it has potential but I really think it needs improving. P.S It crashes alot. 5/10 Please make this game better for the enjoyable hours people may spend on it. I rather play SSX on PS2 which came out in 2000 which has better mechanics than this. Also it would be fun to add snowboarding into it because most people prefer it.			"

								With what originally seemed like a promising concept, I actually bought this game in it's early days. Having not played it for several months, I was surprised to see that it had implemented Snowboards, as well as Snowmobiles, which I was not aware of any plans about. But then I was sorely disappointed to see that not only is the game even buggier now than it ever was before, the people who actually paid money for this got nothing but a few insignificant cosmetic items. They couldn't even be generous enough to gift us the Snowmobiles.Not that it seems it'd ultimately matter, because if their physics and overall quality is anything comparable to the Snowboards, it's effectively useless.

								On paper a fun game and recently since Snowboards and Snowmobiles were added I decided to give the game a shot.  It's fun at face value but there are still many bugs.  All of the customisation items were locked up in the store recently and there is no way to acquire them yet short of paying.  Your character randomly dies at points too, often in the middle of a run or on flat ground so it's frustrating trying to build up enough exp.  Also some levels dont grant any coins on rank up which has to be a bug as well.  Lastly the game just seemingly and randomly CTD's when playing multiplayer.  Also framerate takes a dive in MP as well for no apparent reason.  My advice, quickly add the parks/snowmobiles (shouldnt take more than a week unless your art team is lazy) and fix the bugs.  No point adding new features to a game when players keep crashing to desktop, lagging, dying for no reason and have no way to customise their characters and gear.  I'm gunna keep playing it here and there but for now it's a ""log in 1h a month drunk"" game.  Avoid unless you're a total snowboarding nut, are drunk or just wanna ♥♥♥♥ around with mates.  If you want a serious skiing game with progression and gear unlocks wait a month or two.			"

Early Access Review
								I have always wanted an awesome ski and snowboard game to play around with when I'm not on the slopes, and this game is just that. To start off I want to say that I love this game and hope that it keeps improving. There are many good features about this game, such as the beautiful environment and the control you have over the charcter. If you are into skiing or snowboarding I recommend this game, but if you are not then you might as well wait till it is free. I love the way you are able to control your charcter through spins and flips, but there are many improvements that could be made. I want this game to be the best it could be, so here is my list of things that could be improved: 1: Crashing, I do not like how if you crash a menu screen pops up, I would rather that a crash animation is played and you can continue to ski.FIXED2: The controls are very hard to get used to, and I find it hard to control on the slopes (crashing almost every minute), and I do not like the way you jump, I would prefer if you could just press a key down to bend knees and release to jump.FIXED3: Better physics (still a little choppy escpecially when landing a jump)4: I am hopeing that there will be an increased input on the terrain park, bigger jumps, rails, not as crowded, or even a feature to be able to create your own park.COMINGSOON5: I hope that the creaters put just as much time in to make the snowboarder as they did the skiier since I would love to see some awesome snowboarding in this game.COMINGSOON6: A replay editor would be nice.ADDED7: Different camera angles so you can still ski but view the skiier at different angles.ADDED8: First person would be amazing, which I believe would make this game the greatest ski simulator ever made. I hated the shaun white firts person camera and if this was done, I would hope that the camera would actualy act as the charcters face and as you spin and do flips, the camera does the same giving the view of the skiier.FIXED9: Hopefully better optimization in the future for crappier computers like my own.10. Also I feel that this game should not be a free to play, since if it is not the creators will earn more money and will be able to put in more time and effort to make this into the best ski and board game ever.EDIT: Many of my previous problems have been fixed, and many more future wishes will be added in future updates!

								Have... Have these devs ever done any form of skiing? Because it feels like they didn't. Physics are wonky, controls are delayed and wonky, and this is the most unrealistic skiing experience I've ever had.The developers need to take a good, hard look at the RTL Ski Alpin series.

								The fact that this game recieves so many ill concived reviews baffles me. This game is probably one of the best Free to Play games out there for PC. There is no Pay-2-Win aspects, because any in-game items that are purchased with the games currency are only cosmetic and do not change your stats whatsoever. The game may be a little glitchy but people fail to realize that its still in Early Access, and the fact that some people compare this (which is somewhat of a simulator) to SSX (an arcade style skiing game that has absolutly nothing in common except for the sport) is part of the reason this game gets so many negative reviews, even though it doesn't deserve it. Its F2P so theres nothing to lose and if you don't like it uninstall it, but just get the game because its soo good			"

								It's free, so it's hard to give this game a bad review.But single player is pretty boring, once you hit level 50 its pointless and you can manage to hit that within a couple of hours of gameplay pretty easily.This games all about multiplayer, it would be truely amazing! if it worked...No matter what, it's basically near impossible to play. it's more like cycling through some pictures, rather than frames per a second, it's like frames per a minute. Seriously, it's terrible!I have a high spec pc, its all set up perfectly, my internets one of the fastest in the UK.... You get the idea.Free awesome game, but it's truley pointless when you can't play it. It needs so much work it's probably just worth waiting for Steep, im at my wits end with it now. I won't even be playing it again if they do fix it im so fed up with the lack of Dev support etc.I think the amount of player's online speaks for itself i guess compared to the past. We're all sick of this now. I'd say sort it, but i honestly don't care after this review :)Stay away from this unless you want endless frustation after a couple of hours of awesomeness.			"

								Disclaimer: I like this game. It has some things which make me not recommend it, which I will discuss in this little review.Single player: OK if you want to free roam. Bad if you want to do races of which there are only single person races such as time trials and ""get a high score of X"" and other variants of these modes.Multiplayer: What can I say about multiplayer...It is missing most features that makes single player fun. Such as ragdolls, drones and first person mode.Microtransactions: Theres a ♥♥♥♥♥onne if you want to buy things such as clothes and skis/snowboards. You have to pay for snowmobiles 2 times. That's 1 time more than expected. There is literally no money to be gotten from playing this game. I made around 140 gold* from 7 hours of play. That was enough for...1 hat and 1 mask...they were some of the cheaper items in the game. There are some items available to purchase with real money on the store which is horrible. You cannot choose the colour of the item you buy and you cannot preview them in any way. If you want to buy the in game currency, be prepared to bring a weeks paycheck...they cost WAAAAAAAAYYYY too much.*Gold is what I call the in game currency.Why can't the SJWs target microtransactions instead of people who have different political opinions?

								I really like this game, for where it is curently in delvopment, But i belive that lots of things need to be fixed, grinding gaing speed more songs etc, etc. The direction of this game is very good and i wish it would be a full game for 60$ in the end of its delvopment rather than free to play. Really imersive really fun (Music is a bit quiet, wind is a little to loud) this game can really go places with the right directions and smart decisions, i love these types of games (Snow/Skate games) so i might have a bit of a bias, but my experince has been enjoyable, keep up the great work!

								The fact that this game recieves so many ill concived reviews baffles me. This game is probably one of the best Free to Play games out there for PC. There is no Pay-2-Win aspects, because any in-game items that are purchased with the games currency are only cosmetic and do not change your stats whatsoever. The game may be a little glitchy but people fail to realize that its still in Early Access, and the fact that some people compare this (which is somewhat of a simulator) to SSX (an arcade style skiing game that has absolutly nothing in common except for the sport) is part of the reason this game gets so many negative reviews, even though it doesn't deserve it. Its F2P so theres nothing to lose and if you don't like it uninstall it, but just get the game because its soo good			"

								It's free, so it's hard to give this game a bad review.But single player is pretty boring, once you hit level 50 its pointless and you can manage to hit that within a couple of hours of gameplay pretty easily.This games all about multiplayer, it would be truely amazing! if it worked...No matter what, it's basically near impossible to play. it's more like cycling through some pictures, rather than frames per a second, it's like frames per a minute. Seriously, it's terrible!I have a high spec pc, its all set up perfectly, my internets one of the fastest in the UK.... You get the idea.Free awesome game, but it's truley pointless when you can't play it. It needs so much work it's probably just worth waiting for Steep, im at my wits end with it now. I won't even be playing it again if they do fix it im so fed up with the lack of Dev support etc.I think the amount of player's online speaks for itself i guess compared to the past. We're all sick of this now. I'd say sort it, but i honestly don't care after this review :)Stay away from this unless you want endless frustation after a couple of hours of awesomeness.			"

								Literally the polar-opposite of boring (NOT A PUN).The game freezes up a lot though (AGAIN, NOT A PUN) - definitely an early access game.I think the main reason it's addicting is because it makes you feel a whole lot cooler than you really are (... NOT A PUN).I always get really frosty when I land on the snow perfectly, but then continue to sink and die (... ok fine they're all puns) :P			"

								This game was built with VR in mind. I have a consumer version of the Oculus Rift, of which this game doesn't seem to support out of the box. The workaround is to wipe the current / latest version the Oculus Software and install an older version (8.0), then try to swap between the two. Installing the older Oculus version completely breaks other experiences I have purchased.I'll recommend this game when it brings support for the consumer version, but right now can't recommend if you want to experience this game in VR.

								Disclaimer: I like this game. It has some things which make me not recommend it, which I will discuss in this little review.Single player: OK if you want to free roam. Bad if you want to do races of which there are only single person races such as time trials and ""get a high score of X"" and other variants of these modes.Multiplayer: What can I say about multiplayer...It is missing most features that makes single player fun. Such as ragdolls, drones and first person mode.Microtransactions: Theres a ♥♥♥♥♥onne if you want to buy things such as clothes and skis/snowboards. You have to pay for snowmobiles 2 times. That's 1 time more than expected. There is literally no money to be gotten from playing this game. I made around 140 gold* from 7 hours of play. That was enough for...1 hat and 1 mask...they were some of the cheaper items in the game. There are some items available to purchase with real money on the store which is horrible. You cannot choose the colour of the item you buy and you cannot preview them in any way. If you want to buy the in game currency, be prepared to bring a weeks paycheck...they cost WAAAAAAAAYYYY too much.*Gold is what I call the in game currency.Why can't the SJWs target microtransactions instead of people who have different political opinions?

								Kind of boring. No much to do. Way too hard to pick up speed. Controls are kind of clunky. If you are looking for something that is extremly similar to real life than this is it. If you were looking for something similar to Tony Hawk Pro Skater or Sean White Snowboarding style games then you will be dissappointed.			"

								Pros:-It's free-You can flip around freely-Rewind if you mess upCons-Slow, grindy and boring.-VR mode will make you sick instantly, so that's out too. Even if they fix the menus for VR, it would still make you sick, it's a game design thing.-One mountain only, the other ""mountains"" are small event areas. Menu could use some love there.-You can't walk or help yourself out of a flat area when snowboarding.-Ragdoll on crash looks really bad-Sometimes you won't get the change to rewind-Rewind buffer is a bit smallIt's been a long time in early access and most issues are fixable, but right now I don't like it.It's free, though.

								Okay, I was sketchy on this game at first, but once I played it, I thought it was actually fun. Now yes, it's a free game (At least I think for now), and it's new, and yes it has bugs. But, I believe this game has a lot of potential. I'm sure when you see this game, however, you're going to think, ""Hey, that's a knockoff of Steep!"" Well, you're correct, but it's like the poor man's version of Steep. Some people just don't have enough money for Steep, so they'd like something else that was close to it, and yet get it for little to no price. That's what this game is for. Okay, enough of me blabbering on, what are the pros and cons?Pros:-Costs little to no money-Fun with friends-Big enviroment where you can do tricks and such-Easy to learn-Outfitted for lower PCsCons:-Bugs (But that's every game in it's alpha state- it's prone to change)-Limited Customization (For the moment)-Controls are a bit wonky (But can be fixed)-Low amounts of serversWhile we're talking about controls. The game says it recommends you use a controller. I have to disagree. Even though it's controller supported, there's no need to use that. It's easy to use a mouse and keyboard (But that's just preference). Other people who may be better with a controller should use it, but people who are skilled with a mouse and keyboard, should stick to that, unless they want to learn how to use a controller.With all this said, I say this game is fun, especially with friends. And once the bugs and glitches are fixed, then it would be even more fun, knowing you won't get stuck in the ground every other spawn or going fast down a hill. I recommend this to anyone who wants to have some fun with friends! :D			"

								It's free, so it's hard to give this game a bad review.But single player is pretty boring, once you hit level 50 its pointless and you can manage to hit that within a couple of hours of gameplay pretty easily.This games all about multiplayer, it would be truely amazing! if it worked...No matter what, it's basically near impossible to play. it's more like cycling through some pictures, rather than frames per a second, it's like frames per a minute. Seriously, it's terrible!I have a high spec pc, its all set up perfectly, my internets one of the fastest in the UK.... You get the idea.Free awesome game, but it's truley pointless when you can't play it. It needs so much work it's probably just worth waiting for Steep, im at my wits end with it now. I won't even be playing it again if they do fix it im so fed up with the lack of Dev support etc.I think the amount of player's online speaks for itself i guess compared to the past. We're all sick of this now. I'd say sort it, but i honestly don't care after this review :)Stay away from this unless you want endless frustation after a couple of hours of awesomeness.			"

								My Review of the Early Access Version of SNOWOverview:Pros : Good graphical fidelity           Fun and realistic gameplay           Free-to-Play system is unobtrusiveCons : Game stutters and chugs on every setting setup            Only a few mapsSee My Full Review Below:At the time of the writing of this review, my Steam Library tells me that I’ve pumped approximately 5 hours into SNOW, which is the minimum cut off point for the amount of time I spend in a game before writing a review. SNOW is a game about winter sports. It features an open world setting with numerous maps ranging in size from full blown alpine valley, to miniature Winter Olympics stadiums, as well as 3 types of sports: skiing(my favourite), snowboarding, and snowmobiling(admittedly I still haven't figured out how to access this!). The game is free to download, but features a free-to-play system whereby a player pays into the game through ‘micro-transactions’, in game transactions that either affect cosmetics or gameplay. However, so far I have not uncovered any glaring issues with this system in game as it appears that it only affects cosmetics, and possibly new maps.In regards to the gameplay, I feel obliged to point out first that I myself am at an intermediate level  for skiing in real life as well as video games, and as such know how skis should feel and handle properly. I have to say that this game really nails to feeling of momentum and flow with the skis, with me feeling pretty much in control the entire time, using my DualShock 4 controller, NOT the keyboard which I haven't experimented with yet. However, I especially love the easy to use immediate flick between first and third person, which provides the terrifying experience of hurtling down a mountain at 90mph, whenever you want. On top of that, the game supports VR with the Oculus Rift DK2, which I should imagine you would need 10 spare pairs of trousers handy for.The real problem with the game occurs in the performance category. I run everything at 1080p as a fair test, but vary the in game graphical settings to test performance accordingly. For some odd reason, this game runs exactly at the same FPS on its lowest and highest settings. It appears to run at about 30fps and keeps chugging and stuttering continuously, which is incredibly frustrating and when playing in a proper online event, sometimes costing you the win. It wouldn't annoy me that much as I would usually turn the details down, but if it runs the same either way, then what's the point? Another issue is the settings screen, which seems to auto change my settings after they’re applied which is incredibly frustrating if you want to turn that flipping motion blur off and it won't go away!Overall, I recommend that you download SNOW, it's free and only 4gb after all, as it provides some good quality looks and gameplay. If your hardware can stop it chugging, then bully for you. You got yourself a good game!My Hardware Specs:-	CPU : AMD-	GPU : EVGA Nvidia GTX 960 SC 4GB-	RAM : 8GB of some random stock Kingston RAM-	Motherboard : ASUS A-78M-	Storage : Some kind of Toshiba HDD "

								This game shoudnt be free to play! its that good.this isnt a pay to win either but does offer a varied selection of gear you can buy to customise your look. its skill and mastery of the controls that will win the day.One of the things i love most about this game is you dont even need to follow the courses, infact the game encourages you go go off course to find new locations , you can go off on a adventure down the slopes looking for that massive jump,youll feel both relaxed  and yet moments of intensity as you rush down the slopes, multiplayer is great too, its nice when you find a group all following each other ,can sometimes be funny tho when everyone goes off a cliff like lemmings to there deaths lol, generally tho ive found the community to be very pleasent company especially on the EU servers,only real negative is bugs but with the little time ive played ive already seen regular updates and the bugs are getting ironed out at a relatively fast pace so give it a couple of months and youll be smooth sailing. Controls will be difficult at first make no mistake but after a few hours youll start to get the hang of them.there no excuse to not play this game. get to da choppa! youll not be disapointed.			"

								I recieved a key from the Devs as I signed up for the closed beta early.Alright, so if you look at all the negative reviews there is one complaint they have in common: Microtransactions. Normally I would be on their side, but these kinds of microtransactions are different. They grant you access to PURELY COSMETIC items, that in no way affect gameplay. It's a free-to-play game, obviously there are microtransactions, that's how this works. How else do expect the devs to make money off of this? A $60 AAA game that has microtransactions is something to be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at, not this game. I haven't even seen these microtransactions in-game, but then again I couldn't care less if my character has bunny ears or devil horns. Alright, so a short overview of the actual game. You ski all over a mountain, doing tricks and discovering starting points to level up. The higher your level, the cooler places you can start from. Even though I've only played an hour or so, I can tell this game is not meant for short bursts of playtime. It took me the whole hour to level up once, and the first unlockable location I could find started at level 15. With the amount of actual content in this game, that bar is set a little high and you might not stick with it for that long. Personally I quite enjoy SNOW and will probably spend a lot of time playing it, I've just been so busy one hour is all I've been able to put into it. Alright so yeah the physics are a little.... physics-breaking, but to me that adds in a lot of fun. In real skiing, you can't do a 360 deg. spin, land on the side of a mountain, jump off into a backflip and land just in time to smash right into a tree, then pause and rewind to replay it over and over again: you can do that. You can use it any time for a deduction in points, but if you crash you can use a rewind feature to place you a few seconds before your death so that you can try to fix your mistakes, or remake your demise, whichever you prefer. Yeah this game isn't perfect, but what game is? And while it's in beta, I think it's important for more and more people to play so that the devs can fix as many issues as possible. If you don't like it, refund it and no harm done.			"

SNOW Review From a VeteranAs I now have over 2000 hours in this game, I'd like to add my own opinion to the review scene. Of course, steam glitched my hours and says I only have 4, but that isn't true. (I've also got 6 smurf accounts, each with about 500 hours, so I know what I'm talking about.) First of all, this game is free, and very easy to pick up, although extremely difficult to master. It's definitely worth at least playing from the most casual to advanced gamers out there. It has the most fun skiing trick mechanics I've ever seen (and I've played dozens of ski games. The point system also has come so far from the early days of the game. Playing this game makes me wish that I could ski in real life, but I can't because I live in the middle of the Punjabi Desert. The only salvation I have here is SNOW, it provides an atmosphere that I'm really there ontop of the mountain, ready to ski down.It saddens me seeing all these negative reviews for a masterpiece of a game. And it shows the state of our generation today where nobody actual spends the time to learn a good game, they expect instant entertainment. Anyways, get this game, give it some time and it will be fun.-Mohammad, from the Punjabi Desert			"

								Amazing. Worth the $5 for the snowmobile. I don't need to do challenges or events or multiplayer to have fun in this game. Works very well even if you don't have a controller. I've played it 9.7 hours in the past two weeks since I got it. Landing as well as steering are problems on rock, but if you crash you can usually restart a few times and then glitch over it. You can go more than a hundred miles per hour in this game.			"

								After wasting a few hours downloading this, then finally somehow getting it to connect to the servers and right away getting disconnected I finally got to see the game menu. The game menu is actually quite nice. Unfortunately that's all the gameplay I managed to get since pressing play didn't do anything. I at least wanted to play solo to try this game out but I guess the game won't even allow that. Also it doesn't look like the developers are trying to fix the issues or at least they aren't successful at it because I had to look through forums from over half a year ago with the same issues I'm having and nothing has been fixed.  The game looks great, I wish I could play it.			"

								Downloaded the game in late february. Played a bit then it was pretty fun, just a kind of silly and buggy ski game but super enjoyable and kinda tense. Decided to play with a friend again today and it's not nearly as enjoyable as 2 months ago.Now you have to mash W to go forward and movement is more restricted, So you are basically a slug on skis. What i liked was that you could just jump in and ski around at the speed of sound do some silly and maybe cool things. which those things have pretty much halved. I can see some people enjoying the more realistic side but it's not for me and maybe not for you, sorry for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review			"

								it's a fun game, with lots of potential but it's clearly lacking at the moment. i was expecting some sort of racing game but it wasn't... basically you just ski around with no apparent goal. it's fun, cusual, good for killing time but i highly doubt i'd be able to play this for a very long time. there are way too few tricks; a mix of grab and spin. zero customization, you can't even choose your sex. clothes are all from real money store, which is a big let down. save point are hard to find, score (or exp) is only obtainable from doing jump & trick which is stupid. multiplayer is still locked... no idea what it will look like. and the effect of speed is barely there. on the other side, the open world aspect is really interesting (even though most of the drop point are still locked) you can go anywhere on the mountain, jump anywhere... i wish project powder still existed, because i'd be playing that instead!

Early Access Review
								Nowhere near ready yet.  However I see it's been in development since Oct 2013, so I have little hope.- Physics are terrible.  For a snow game, this is imperative to get right, but they're weird as hell.  Keep mashing the button that makes your character boost himself forward, and you can ski/snowboard uphill indefinitely.  Then you have the issue where you don't seem to accelerate correctly going downhill, but can carry that momentum indefininitely over flat or rough terrain.  You can test this by skiing/boarding to the bottom of the mountain, through a village, then just keep going through the rolling hills between the mountains.- Multiplayer doesn't work.  Period.  If you're in the Eastern US, don't bother.  You can try to join US East servers and the connection icon will spin indefinitely with no way to quit other than alt+F4.  Or you can join a European server with ~160 ping and stutter every two seconds, to the point where it's unplayable.  This is a major flaw since it's advertised as multiplayer.- no map or compass.  The freeroam portion hinges on being able to find new areas, but you have literally no way of telling where you are or where you've been.  From my research this has been a known demand to the devs since at least Oct 21st 2013, but in a news post on their site they say they have no idea how to implement an interactive map.  That's a very bad sign.- instead of letting you take off your gear and walking if you want to explore something uphill, you need to buy a five dollar (USD) snowmobile.  To go up a hill.  Assuming, of course, you can't trick the physics engine to send you uphill anyway.- Solo mode is utterly empty.  No life at all, no AI skiiers or boarders, you're the only one in a massive mountain range.  Very eery and ties into why having a broken multiplayer mode is a bad thing.- No snow physics and your equipment is always clipping.  Minor annoyance more than anything; it constantly looks like your character is riding across the snow in just their boots.  Your trail is just a 2D mask placed over the surface that also clips into the terrain.  This is a practice used since the 90s, by 2017 the devs should at least introduce some terrain deformation and be able to keep your character high enough above the terrain to not clip.  I only bring this up because literally every snowboarding/skiing game I can think of in the past decade has done this...In conclusion:  Very rough, very empty, very broken, from what I understand the devs are taking the money and running with it.

								I'm sorry I have to do this guys (addressing the devs)... but (addressing the players) listen to me if you thought about getting this game.If you were in doubt about waiting for SNOW's F2P release or buying the early access pass, I can tell you straight away. Don't. Buy. It. As a professional skier I can tell you right away, this game doesn't replicate that atmonsphere what so ever. It lags, it trembles, you can bounce off a net-fence like 200 feet up the mountain but an almost head on colission with a tree only nudges you 10 inches to the left/right. It's not completely horrible, it has potential, but it's unplayable.Pros- good selection of stuff (maps, courses, jump, grinds, clothes -- although it practices microtransactions)- big environments- good music- stylish menu... and sadly that's about it.Cons- it runs like my grand grand grand father (on a laptop that could do GTA V at 40-50 FPS on Normal, 1280x720)- textures/objects suddenly appear in front of you- the devs are doing very slow work (still have a friend pending on Close Beta Access since day 1)- the camera is just bad, plain and simply bad, I don't get the feeling that's me who's skiing- you can't see the difference in terrain elevation or the difference between a slope and powder... at all... not kidding... and I could actually go on an on for a while.Laptop Specs:- i7-2630QM 2.0GHz CPU with 8 cores- nVidia GeForce 630M 2Gb- 4Gb RAM DDR3All in all, I would like you not to judge my lack of in-game time as I couldn't (not wouldn't) play because of the performance. I believe there are many people out there who consider buying it but, as a guy who was exactly in your shoes 2 hours ago, don't buy it. Just wait to for F2P release by playing good games. You'll say ""that crazy guy was right all along"" then.I'm sorry devs. Maybe you will fix this stuff soon. I also work in game development and I know how hard it is. Keep on trying, but not in the direction you're heading to right now.Best regards.TOTAL: 4/10.			"

								First off, this game is full of potential and I can't recommend it right now because there's still a lot to be done before it is in a stable state.1) You crash very frequently. This can be anything from sitting in the spawn menu too long to simply skiing off piste too fast. I do understand this game is VERY early access and this can be sorted however.2) The servers are too small. I have no doubt that ther server capacity will be increase further down the line but trying to join any server with friends is nigh on impossible. 12 slots per server (nearly all of which are US based) makes it very difficult to enjoy the main selling point of this game.3) Physics are iffy. By that I mean there doesn't seem to be any when you perfrom certain actions. For example, going straight down off piste snow DOES cause you to go off course and lose stability, but if you carve left and right you remain fixed to the ground. In my experience carving on off piste snow is more likely to make you crash than going straight down, addingsmall corrections here and there4) Character models need some work. Your character has a very default looking face; no smile and dead looking eyes. I think some work on the faces and posture of the skier could improve it drasticallyBesides these issues (which will most likely be fixed by the devs) the game can be fun. If you can get into a server with your friends you'll get a decent amount of enjoyment out of the core game, though as said before there is work to be done on SNOW. When that's done or a nice big update comes out, I'll edit my review accordingly :)			"

								I haven't put too long into the game but for the time I have put in, it's been enjoyable. I haven't done anything aside from roam and mess about on multiplayer servers because in no way do I have the skill to do an event.My only problem with the game so far would have to be the fact that sometimes it will freeze on me and I think it's due to latency as it isn't frame drop/ my computer.However it's a fun game, I've been playing it solo and have had a blast.7/10, only due to the minor bugs such as freezing.

								When it showed up in steam, SNOW was looking like a cool game with so much promise. As a winter sports fan and avid snowboarder, I naturally got excited and bought the game. Excitement ended right after the game was finished downloading and launched for the first time however.It was a disgrace that steam would (at the time) would allow such a pile of misery to be sold. Anyway, I thought I’d wait for updates and maybe, just maybe the game got better... It never happened unfortunately, when first released it was not even in a tech demo state. Fortunately it improved a lot from that state, however, the game is not in a good state after more than a year. Menus are still a mess. Skiing physics are a joke. Snow physics are non-existent. It seems like developers are wasting all their time on irrelevant stuff like licensed gear(more on this later), before making an actual game that works and plays well. And then there is the best part. I could swear when I purchased SNOW, store page did not mention game would go free to play when completed. The moment I realized the F2P thing, I got mad, very mad. Not because I care much about the money I paid. I honestly don’t. I can afford to lose $15 and not give a damn about it.However the whole business model of this company made me sick to my stomach. People should not be allowed to sell a game that will eventually go F2P. No wonder they are spending so much time and effort on licensed outfits and gear, instead of actually making a game. If ever completed -somehow I highly doubt it- SNOW will be nothing more than an advertising thingy. TLDR : Very incomplete and shows little promise. Avoid. Will go free anyway. "

ENGLISH and Italian Review Recensione Inglese ed ITALIANA English: No, i'm sorry. This game is just not for me and i can't reccomend it. The physics of this game makes me really nervous for some reason, and it's still buggy. (I had some major freezes in which the game unlocked all the achievements itself.) And, do not buy it now. I read it'll be free to play. I only hope, for who eventually would like a ski simulator, that it'll be a good  ski simulator as well once completed.Italiano: No. Mi spiace, ma no. Questo gioco non fa proprio per me e non posso proprio raccomandarlo. La fisica di questo gioco mi innervosisce in una maniera assurda per qualche strana ragione, ed il gioco è ancora buggo. (Mi sono capitati un paio di grossi freeze completi del gioco in cui mi ha sbloccato tutti gli achievement da solo.) E non compratelo ora. Ho letto che sarà free to play. Spero soltanto, per le persone a cui potrebbe davvero piacere un simulatore di sci, che diventerà un buon simulatore di sci, una volta completato.			"

								I'm not sure about this game. I know it's early access but it just seems gimicky. The various paid tiers and the possibility of endless micro transactions is what scares me. The game itself is alright. It's not a simulator by any means, more of a graphically updated version of the old SSX games (which I found more entertaining) with quirky Skate style controls. If the developers take this game too seriously they will ruin it. If it looks interesting to you, try it. If you have even the slightest doubt then I would spend your money elsewhere.			"

								SNOW was a game I impulse bought after a skiing trip, to see how it was. The concept is smart, but it has been poorly executed with numerous technical glitches, difficult control scheme, and little overall gameplay guidence. Yes, I understand that it is a skiing game that doesent need a lot of guidence other than go down a mountain, but the lack thereof gives the game a very, VERY empty feeling. I am asking for a refund for this game, but since I got it over the 2 week limit (which I find a very discriminitory rule, especially for games that were gotten before the refund policy was enacted) its iffy. At this point, I find very little interest in the game, and hope that the game picks up and that I be proven wrong in future.			"

								This game is really ♥♥♥♥ing fun! and there are so many thingts that could be added to make it better. IF you are not sure about buying this just buy it is so worth it.Also i think that these things would be really fun to have:-co-op would be really fun-a gamemode where you try and hurt yourself as much as you can in a time limit and you get a score for it against one of your friends like they have in skate it is so much fun and would be great for skiing as there are some really nasty drops-there could be a bit more terrain wise to make the game more interesting like rivers and streams or big pits also there should be more access to parts of the rock so you could have even more big drops as they are the best-finally you should be able to unlock some things depending on your best trick like for a certain pair of skis you need to get 5000 points in one jumpI understand that this game is only alpha but i hope the developers could put some of this in :) very goog game			"

								Whoever is giving this a thumbs up is a moron or being paid by the devs, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing broken, I don't care that it looks good, I care that when I use a controller I can see the cursor pop up in menus, that I fall through the world randomly when spawning, that invisible walls are what contain me to the mountain, when I try to see what the controls are the button in the menu is grayed out so I can't select it, there are multiple rocks that you can just go straight through and some random ♥♥♥♥ing castle out on the side is completely unfinished. I don't give a single♥♥♥♥♥♥if this is in early access, the only reason the devs put it there was to make more money for themselves it is painfully appearent that none of it went into this game.			"

								This game sucks.Its basically Amped 3 for 360 with updated graphics.Yeah, thats right. Amped snowboarding, the ♥♥♥♥♥iest, most boring game you ever played..... All the animations are rigid, the board doesnt appear to bump or grind along the ground like in games like SSX on tour, the rider doesnt feel the bumps on his feet, the entire animations look robotic and fake ujst like in Amped.If you liked Amped, you will love this, im sure..If you hated Amped, like me, and thuoght it was one of the most boring , and poorly made snowboarding games ever,you wont like this. It doesnt have any of the sparkle of SSX or the 1080's of the past. It doesnt even have much sense of speed, or most importantly, the FEEL of the snow under the board just isnt there. Where as it is still present in a much older PS2/GC/XBOX game from 2005. This game is Amped... In all its boring glory.. if you like ultra-boring sims you will be happy but i think it lacks a certain amount of polish.. and flavor.. Also, SSX > Amped.			"

								Why did I pay for this heaping sack of fermented poop?First off, this is a paid for F2P game. . . all you're actually getting is some attrocious looking cosmetic stuff.  Sadly, when i bought this (Febuary 2014) I must have been tired and not have realized this.  If it had been in the genre of F2P (Like it should have) then I never would have paid a penny.  I actually beg the people reading this to wait until it's fully F2P before deciding to give them money.  It's bad. . . really bad.  You'd have more fun with Bad Rats.Now on to the game play.When I went to customize my character, all the logos and designs were blurred out and looked horrid.  So I got character set up in his blurry clothes and went to play.  It stuck on the loading screen for a few minutes and CRASH.  No error message was given. The game was closed and here was my desktop.  So I loaded it to give it another try.  Third person view seemed okay.  I did a backflip in midair and i did a grind on something.  Nothing impressive. I've seen better in the original tony hawk pro skater.  Fooled around a bit and that seemed like all i could figure out how to do other than crash and make my head flop around in a goofy fashion. After the first shot, I decided to try another track.  I don't know what I did, but I suddenly found myself in 1st person view.  This seemed kinda badass and actually easier to see what i was doing.  I actually kind of liked this. Almost had fun for a few minutes, then it wore thin and i closed it.Maybe in ANOTHER year or two they might have this up to the point of being playable. . . but not yet.  Seriously - save your money.			"

								Reposting my review because people make assumptions and get salty.1 - Done the tutorial.2 - I know how to restart a game to get the graphics settings to change. Didn't do♥♥♥♥♥♥3 - Yes I've played little of the game, because the terrible graphics/physics made it near-impossible to play.Pros:The music.The intended visual style.Cons:Buggy as anything.Physics are not even half-realistic.Character control is poor at best.Visually the game is bad.Bland game overall.I'd like to see this game improve, and I'll probably still play it here and there because I'm not shelling out £40 for Steep (which is far better but hell no not worth £40), but until that time, this game gets a 'not recommended' from me because it's just poorly made at this point in time. I honestly hope this game gets better.			"

Also half the time the game crashes when you click anything other than the first options. the turtoial for snowboarding is broken, amongst other things. ughh spewing had such potential but im getting rid of this now as it keeps messing up steam.

								Its not that I don't like this game, I do. It's a fun lil snowboarding game that almost reminds me of the SSX and Amped: Freestyle that I played back when I did the console thing. It's just there's a lotta bugs, the wipeouts are hilariouslyyyy bad (which might even convince some to play), the business model is a lil.... restrictive (though i understand they gotta make money to continue production). I'd honestly give this game a Thumbs Up if there wasn't a bug that happened to me every 20 minutes where my skiier would just freeze in animation and all my controls freeze up except steering so i look like a gmod prop hunt stiffy old man flying down a hill. Funny the first time, frustrating the 20th.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is a massive disappointment.  Looking for an SSX-style experience, I downloaded this game and tried to look past the fact that it's about skiing and not snowboarding.  I found joy in trying to get the hang of an interesting set of mechanics, mostly from the falls that ensued.  Overall, I would not recommend this game in its current state, for the following major reasons:[1] ControlsThe controls are clunky and hard to maneuver quickly with.  I imagine it would be nicer playing with a controller, but even with a variety of keyboard configurations there was just no comfortable way to control everything.[2] GameplayThe worlds are severely limited, despite what the game has advertised thus far.  I was expecting something open world or at least level-based with large maps.  A standard run on one of the terrain park maps is literally three nice tricks.  If I remember from SSX 3, you could go down from the top of the mountain to the bottom and it would take 25-45 minutes depending on your route and speed.[3] LimitedThe developers have focused entirely too much on making this a simulator and not enough on making it enjoyable.  I don't want to play a game about something I can basically do or figure out how to do in real life.  I want to soar in the clouds and do insane tricks which aren't even possible in real life.  I don't want to cruise around at 10 MPH down the bunny hill terrain park, I want to fly down a double black diamond and launch off of a kicker, 200 feet into the air.  The gameplay physics are insanely realistic, to the point where it's not even fun.2 stars out of 5.			"

								It was made in 10 Oct, 2013 and still in early access.... I feel like the creators just gave up on the game itself.IF, the creators didnt give up, here are some bugs and tips : 1. the most annoying but only for visual is the snowboard or ski's going through the snow (ground)2. The graphics (especially models) are not so good, even though its still in early access FOR 3 YEARS GODDAMIT.3. please add more details to the snow (ground) or make a option to tone down the snow color, so i could ♥♥♥♥ing see without getting eye strain or going blind!4. many people praise it for beeing the only free snowboarding game, i can agree, but the physics are weird as hell sometimes, i get stuck between nothing and some stones, going back and forth everytime i press wIm giving this game a negative review because its free.BUT, just because its free doesnt mean it can have bugs and look horrible with microtransactions!

								This game is awful I was thrilled when I got this game because I thought is was going to be like the trailer. I was extremly disipointed with the option settiongs first off when i click enter after I get the settings I want i just puts it back to default and this cant be because of my pc because I have the latest surface pro 3 .  Then when I started out on a slope the game was dark and extemly delayed. Over all it is disapointing and not worth your 15  dollars so if I were you i would buy something else and i would love a refund.			"

								So far I don't really like this game. The button layout is horrendous, I thought it would be like skate, but for some reason they went the Tony Hawk route. The graphics are lackluster, I turned the graphics all the way up and it barely looks better than a PS3 game. The interface is weird, and it's really stupid how you can't just easily get up after crashing. Overall I am extremely dissapointed, I snowboard and I don't want a snowboarding/skiing game to be as difficult as it is in real life, I want to have fun. Some people might like the realistic feel, but it's not for me.			"

USE A CONTROLLERThis is one of the few games I will ever recommened using a controller for but it just feels much much better with an xbox/ps game controller.This game is oddly relaxing, you can either pick to learn complex tricks that involve many grabs and spins or you can simply just go down slopes and enjoy the pretty view! If I had to compare this to any game I would say the skate 1 on console. I dont play many winter sports games so maybe that is a poor comparison but to my best judgement thats what it feels like. The first person view takes a bit to get used to but my god when you get the hang of it, it can be a trip. There are microtransactions for different hats, skiis, poles, tops but you do get in game credits for leveling up, you just have to play the game enough to get cool looking stuff! Other than the usual early access BS , bugs, random crashes (in game like invisible walls) this game is pretty solid. Free too, I mean what do you have to lose? Give this game a shot! Another strange thing in servers is sometimes I go to search and only see one US east coast server and then sometimes I go and see 4-5.			"

It seems to me like they've focused most of their efforts so far on making the game pretty and having lots of clothes rather than making the skiing fun.  It just feels clunky as hell, the skier seems to just have one large surface which is sliding along the snow, spin and flip speed is extremely difficult to control, turning, again, it doesn't feel like carving or sliding, it feels like you're playing as a box which you're rotating on it's current up axis.Hopefully these guys will get their priorities straight, because honestly, I wouldn't care if all the game had was a jump and a rail with one player model if the skiing actually felt like skiing.

								Beautiful game, still has some bugs but overall well done. I recommend playing it with a controller as the controls are much more comfortable than keyboard. One problem I have with this game is that it will not launch in VR for Oculus Rift CV1 which is a huge disappointment. Some other people have reported this as well on the discussion board.			"

								I paid two bucks to play the beta, I expected the finished game will cost more than $ 2. Instead, the game became a free to play game, and the people who paid money to help development, will not receive anything in return for their help. The store is also very expensive.However, the game is very enjoyable and I will continue to play it.			"

								This game isn't bad. It's astonishingly bad. Now, I'm not a stickler for physics and stuff. Clipping through stuff is fine, especially in early access, however there's so much wrong it's unplayable. We'll start with the good first, because it's not all bad. Some of the maps, Fochi in particular are pretty fun and the tricks are neat when you can land them.That's about all I can say I enjoyed.I think the biggest thing is the camera, it's placed directly behind your chacrater completely obscuring your vision. Skiing is all about being able to see where you're going, this simply doesn't replicate that feeling.The controls are floaty at bast, they simply don't have any tightness to them and things like being unable to cut when you're crouched are counter intuative and break what little immersion there is.The game is setup for a 360 controller but the menus don't recognize it sometimes, notably the options. And exiting a map is impossible through the recommended ""press B to quit"" option.While this is an early access game it's no where close to being playable. I certainly hope it can be pushed forward because certain parts do feel fun, but overall it's simply lacking.			"

								Well, it IS free, and despite some wonky physics is a pretty impressively roomy freestyle skiing game.That said, the netcode is laughable. Even now that they've replaced online ragdolls with much more boring stationary gravestones, you'll still run into invisible crap constantly and ""crash"" in completely empty expanses of slope. I'm also having some weird graphics issues on specific slopes, but nothing gamebreaking.			"

								SNOW is a great game to play singleplayer. It's a very relaxing but yet exciting experience. There are a few bugs in the game but it's still in early access so that's to be expected. I havent played much multiplayer because all of the servers have very high pings. Overall I would say download this game for a fun singleplayer experience but not for multiplayer.			"
