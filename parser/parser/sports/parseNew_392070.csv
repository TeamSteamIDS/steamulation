												Pumped BMX + is a fast platformer that revolves around controlling your BMX bike and doing as many tricks as you can without crashing, while riding towards a finish. Gameplay-wise it's similar to another popular indie game, OlliOlli. I've played it on Xbox 360 Controller and the controls felt really great, speed control is handled with one button, left stick is used for balancing and right stick is used to do specific tricks in the air. The game is responding to every button press precisely and I haven't seen any problems related to possible bad latency. (Don't worry, the game runs with 60 FPS without problems.)Length of the game seems to be nice, there are 5 sets of levels and every level has a set of easy, normal and hard challenges - completing each level challenges for specific difficulty unlocks the harder challenges. This way, you'll gladly replay all levels multiple times and you won't even mind, as you really have to try to be better and usually do some specific tricks. This is a delight option for players who don't care about the score, they still get enough motivation to replay levels.You might be afraid of higher difficulty, which obviously you can expect on hard challenges, but the frustration doesn't come so easily, as you can restart any level in a second. There's no time to rest, you can beat everything!Visuals look really nice for the game (check screenshots and make your own opinion), the soundtrack contains mostly electronic music with electroswing influence. Achievement are well designed, as there aren't any laughable easy ones - each achievement really requires to do something challenging.It's been several months since the game have been released and it's sad that it didn't get much attention from players, because it's a really nice game that's entertaining even for people who doesn't play bike/skateboard platformers. Recommended!			"

												This game is really good fun.There are only two cons: Controls (especially for keyboard) and lack of Steam workshop/user-made levels.a) Controls: I haven't tried with a controller, I suppose it's much better. The main flaw with a keyboard is that there are no hints in-game as to what does what. It's simple enough to figure out though: Arrow keys are one stick, WASD are the other stick, shift (either one) is a modifier button and space bar is to take impulse. Once you figure those out, that's it. Oh, needless to say, there's no way to change the key binds either.With that said, I have the impression that keyboard makes it much harder to do some of the tricks. Instead of using only two or three fingers to different directions, you ought to use at least eight fingers. That gives your brain a knot! haha. Especially since some tricks are stick diagonal, which in keys mean pressing AW or WD at same time, together with an arrow, potentially shift, and space bar at the right time. Good luck with that. XDb) Levels: They are good fun and well designed. I've seen people complaining that there aren't enough, or that the game is too short. There are 5 groups of levels, each having at least 8 levels or so? Hence not so little. With 1 hour of gameplay I haven't even finished the 1st group yet, so we're talking at least 5 hours to complete them all. I think I'll take longer. But I'm taking my time, and I'm trying to clear all challenges in all levels, in all three easy/medium/hard. If you don't do that you can zoom past all levels in a few minutes I guess.But the big thing is: After you've done all the challenges in the 3 difficulties, there's not that much to do I guess. Unless you create your own challenges, and come up yourself with new and wicked tricks of increasing difficulty, or try to beat your own high score, that kind of thing. But I can see myself losing interest rather quickly after completing the levels. User made levels would make this game a true gem worth playing many many hours!All the rest is good fun!The physics are marvelous. I like that the physics and tricks are ""realistic"" in a way, not too crazy or bogus. The tricks feel smooth and very satisfying when you land just right. The art is pretty cool. I catch myself laughing at the crashes fairly often. It's very amusing and fun, at least for some time.If you like these kinds of games, just get it. I am a big fan of games like the flash Bike Mania series, and have tried many clones and similar ones, and Pumped BMX is by far the best and the most fun.Edit: about physics and pedallingI see reviews of people not recommending this because you can't pedal your bike. Wut?It's just a game mechanic, indeed you can't. Anyone who knows BMXs know that if you're doing tricks at speed you won't pedal anyway because the gear ratios are just wrong. So it's all about getting the right impulses with your body to launch and land, and that's marvelously simulated in the game! It's great, and it works.Press space bar to give a first impulse down hill. When you release space the dude will throw his body up, so you need to time your release with your jump for maximum air. Once in the air, press space bar to bring your body down again, that adds a lot of impulse downwards. It's very satisfying.Sure, if you fail and you scrub all your speed you can't pedal and the dude will just come to a stop and jump from the bike. It's weird at first but it's a game mechanic that works. If you'd start pedalling mid-level from a stand-still you wouldn't have enough speed to clear the following jumps anyway. Time your impulses right and keep your momentum, it's a great mechanic and it feels great when done right!Also, some tricks kill momentum. As they should. A 360 in the air will slow you down for example, much more than a backflip. A bar spin barely slows you down, a table top slows you quite a bit more. So in the more difficult levels it's all about gathering momentum in the first 2 or 3 jumps in order to get massive air in the latter big jumps. If you try to put too many tricks into the first few you'll not have enough speed to nail the last ones. Again, I find it to be very good and intelligent mechanics.			"

												Really enjoyed this, even though I was rubbish at it to start (even in the tutorial) I carried on playing and found loads of amazing stunts that made me want to keep playing. I understand a lot of these style games have been done but must admit this version has been made very well and care has been taken to make it enjoyable yet challenging. Reccomended for all bike and stunt game lovers. Will come back for more 7/10

												Tutorial and gameplay is fked up for both controller and keyboard. ""press A to.."" - I actually have to press B. Keyboard controls don't show.To play the game you need 3 hands (or have to live with the weird controls), so co-op is sort of a requirement. I mean, you have to have your thumbs on both sticks and move the other in a direction to do tricks WHILE awkwardly pressing B. For the ultimate tricks you need to have thumb on both sticks, hold both (usually in a different direction) and awkwardly press B WHILE pressing LB to change trick type...  just for one trick in a level where you need to combo them.Not going to play because of controls alone.

												Really enjoying this game and it's music.  Loads of little port bugs I keep running across and very limited resolution choices is a bit discouraging though.  Hopefully the dev will fix up all the minor glitches, nothing game breaking.  First off, while using the keyboard/mouse to navigate the tutorial menus, I got stuck in the level selction screen, clicking on levels or back or select and keyboard controls all made clicks but did nothing, had to force close game.  Switched to gamepad and was able to navigate the menus, but during the tutorial, it kept saying things like ""For big tricks press #NotInString#Glyph.xb1 or something to that effect, forcing me to guess through the controls.

												The best game I can compare this to is Joe Danger. 2D playing field, while you do stunts and trickss on the obstacles ahead of you.It has a nice calming soundtrack, and the game adds a fair bit of challenge, starting from easy and I would even say insanely hard and frustrating.It has simple, yet stunning visuals. The colors pop out and add that sense of immersion. Tricks vary from form to form, and are either easy, or hard to pull off and chain together. "

												I really wanted to like this game, but the controls are just horrible.Diagonal tricks keep registering as one of 4 directions.Tricks only register if you actually do them stand-alone which ruins fun of chaining.The landing speed is weirdly inconsistent (you seem to get more speed from actually landing on one wheel).This together makes getting through some maps an excercise in patience (I just can't finish the last map in the first area, I just cant pull of the 720 combo trick, not enough air time).

												I was in love with this game for about 7 levels. Then, on level 8, it all fell apart. The game starts off as a seemingly fun, free-style trick performance version of Trials. Each level has three different difficulties which require you to hit different single trick scores, overall scores, and perform a specific trick. The game allows a lot of creativity in how you accomplish the overall score, which allows for some insanely fun trick combos.However, the devil is in the details with this game. There's no restart button, so when you fail something, you either have to intentionally crash to get to the menu with a restart button or wait until your character sits still long enough to time-out. This is especially frustrating, because the game is extremely nitpicky about the tricks you land. For instance, if you have to do a 720 Old School -> Table, but accidentally land it with a manual, it doesn't count. To make matters worse, when playing with a controller, all of the tricks are executed by using the right stick in one of 8 directions. It's pretty easy to perform the tricks mapped to one of the four major directions, but tricks mapped to a diagonal can be maddeningly inconsistent. Numerous times, I performed a tailspin (pressing right) while attempting to perform an old school (diagonal up/right) and then chain into an old school while still holding the right stick in the exact same spot.These issues could be forgiven were it not for the sudden and unforgiving rigidity in level design. The for the first set of levels, the first seven levels require a small amount of momentum management and the occasional jump that requires precision. The eighth and final level of the set then suddenly requires you to hit every jump nearly perfectly to have enough momentum for the next jump. This, combined with the occasional difficulty of performing the correct trick, makes for maddening moments of trial and error.It would be one thing if you had to chain your jumps perfectly to maintain momentum and that took you a few tries or if you had to occasionally retry because the controller registered the wrong move. But when you've tried four times in a row to finally get through with enough momentum to perform the trick you need to perform, and then you suddenly find yourself performing the wrong trick due to the way the controls are set up, it gets a little ragey. Then, when you've gone through this loop half a dozen times and have finally performed the correct first part of the trick, but then have to press up two or three times to get it to start the next part of the trick only to crash because you no longer have enough air-time, you want to throw your controller across the ♥♥♥♥ing room.If you love games that are about levels designed in a way to demand insane precision in performance, you'll probably enjoy this. If you just wanted to fresstyle tricks, you might want to steer clear of this one.			"

												Weird. I'm shocked that the other reviews are not absolutely plagued with complaints about the BMX biker not able to pedal the bike. If you land on an upwards slope with low speed, you can hold ""A"" to speed up but all the biker does is crouch low and not pedal. So the game says you're going to slow and boom - game over. Anyways I guess that maybe that's just how the game is suppoed to be played. You need to keep your speed up and the biker is not allowed to pedal. I'm trying to get into that mentality, but I just can't. THE PEDALS ARE RIGHT THERE DAMNIT!! PUT YOUR FEET DOWN AND GO SCRUB!!! Anyways I can't possibly recommend this game for that alone. It makes the game ultra frustrating. However the game seems very fun in the levels where this isn't a concern. Really brings me back to the Tony Hawk 2 glory days. I think I'll go back and try to play some more downward sloping levels only :/ In closing my birthday wish is to hold A and have my biker move those little speed inducing pegs under his feet. That would be so delightful.			"

Posted: August 18, 2016
												Was hoping for something like trials with tricks, but that's not the case. In this game, you do jumps and ride down slopes while doing tricks. The problem is there is no pedaling at all. You need to use momentum during entire level or you fail. If you don't have perfect momentum and can't climb the hill, make the jump, etc, you lose and must restart the level all over again. Confusingly on some parts when you land on a raised platform you can't use the speed up button. Also even if you are moving foward in parts if you aren't going fast enough you suddenly fall and lose. Its poor game design that forces trial and error because you won't know the next part and be able to plan your jump for it, forcing you to fail and restart it all. Something like checkpoints would be helpful, but due to poor design of having to use same momentum throughout level wouldn't work. The other issue is how finnicky the entire game mechanics are. I would do a jump 10 times, and only land it once. This is because the length or heigh is so far that you have to be perfect. And to be perfect you need to use your increased fall speed at the perfect time at the perfect spot of the downward part of the slope, and then let off it at the perfect part at the top of the jump. Its hard to tell where this is, which makes it frustrating. Even if you get it, you have to do the same thing 5 more times, and if you don't you need to do it all again. Then if beating the level isn't enough, you have to fufill a bunch of random objectives to unlock the next world. It's poor game design to force repetition and failure and increase game length artificially. Playing this game made me see all the problems and realize how much more fun this could have been as a trials type game with tricks. 3/10.			"

I wish the levels would have changed a bit, but oh well.Would recommend for $10, being able to play essentially the mobile game on a large screen with controller was well worth it.			"

												This game would be fantastic if it weren't for the incredibly high difficulty. There's three modes, Easy/Medium/Hard but you wouldn't know it from the titles They should be relabled to ""Hard/Hard/Hard"" These levels are so hard to complete and are based on extreme precision. The overall feel of the game is wonderful and feels great to pull off tricks but if your velocity is just a SMIDGEN off you will fail the level. This kid can't ride his bike uphill what so-ever which adds to the frustration. It's not hard to pull of the requested tricks and points, but just to complete the level itself is the diffcultly. I wish there was a level editor so I could give the middle finger to the devs and design levels I actually want to play.			"

												Waste of money and even bigger waste of potential.   The mechanics in the game are horrible, the early levels are near impossible due to not being able to ♥♥♥♥ing peddle your bike.  Even on the very early levels, there is literally no margine for error, as you are learning the game.  Took me 20 minutes to just get past one course because you can't get enough speed to make a standard jump because you have no control over the speed of the bike. The courses are cool, but extremely tiny.  This is NOT a game where you get to ride around and do tricks and have fun.  You do very, very short little runs with maybe 4 jumps to do a trick off of, 4 max.  Each run will take you about 20 seconds then you load another.  Wash, rinse repeate.This game is so amazing on the surface but the designers royaly ♥♥♥♥ed up the mechanics and there is little to no freedom, making it signifiganty less fun that is should and could be.  DO NOT BUY.  This game is nothing more than a glorified phone game (about 30 of them, think Hill Climber) you can get for free.  5/10 Literally fix the speed issue and allow some damn freedom to just play and do tricks and this game is an easy 10, but the lack of being able to make simple jumps without glitching the game is pure stupid and not worth money.  Would make a great free phone game though, just not worth  paying for.			"

												Good port from mobile devices. Seems to play a little slower than its mobile counterpart. Levels look nicer and its pretty addicting. Will say there is a big learning curve.. once you master it its a blast though.			"

												A wonderful gem of a game, easy to pick up but hard to master. Extremely satisfying nailing those crazy combos/big tricks, simple yet effective graphics, fun soundtrack - there's really nothing bad to say about this game. Well worth purchasing and playing!			"

												I really enjoy this game! It's great for doing a few sessions before work or when i just need to kill time. People seem to have a problem getting speed and that is because they must not know about the speed boost and height boost. I have completed every track no problem and love it. I only wish they would come out with more tracks and other content. I can play this game for hours coming up with crazy combos and trying to do a manual through the entire course. I think they did a great job, just needs more content. I do reccomend this game if you enjoy rythem sections and landing cool tricks. This game is awesome with an xbox 360 controller. Use the left stick and push it left or right, right before taking off of a jump and it will give you a boost. Left = Height boost  Right = Speed boost or Distance			"

												Trials'ı sevip de almayı düşünüyorsanız almayın. Kontrolleri insanı zorluyor. Eğer bu oyunu almaya karar verdiyseniz fakat Trials'ı bilmiyorsanız, Trials'ı alın. Ha şunu da belirteyim kendi içinde güzel bir oyun bu sebeple thumbs up veriyorum.			"

												+casual+good way to get your bike fix when the weather is not suitable/out of season.-lack of customization for controls-thinks my joystick is a controller, and there is no way around it besides unplugging it. -cannot pedal. This is annoying as you're supposed to be on a bicycle. If you lose too much speed you crash.-course flow depends on special boosts to clear certain types of jumps.			"

												Pumped BMX + Is an awesome game, it will keep you playing for hours, and I have only played on it for two days! This game is so addictive!Pros :-Addicting -Rewarding-Satisfying-Lots of levels and customisation for your character!-Several detailed tricks like tail-whips, decades, bar-spins and old schools!-Realistic speed, gravity and tricks!-Cool cartoon but not childish graphics!-Easy to get 60fps on best graphics!Cons :-Gets hard, I have to do a cliffhanger backflip >> superman!-Too addicting-T2 ( harder ) tricks are awkward to use on a keyboard as you sometimes do the wrong trick!-No level creator!-No endless mode!Overall a great purchase and worth the money! If you like BMX, Scooter and Skateboard tricks and platformer games then you should love this 8.5/10 !!!			"

												This game delivers what alot of us riders are looking for. Its colorful, attractive and most of all extremely fun to play! The physics are on point and the tricks are there with combos like crazy. Would love to see this taken to open world some day. It would be crazy fun to play! Love this game though!			"

												Awesome game, i was a huge fan of the motorbike game TRIALS, this is basicly that but with BMX but instead of best time finished its all about the trick points etc.game runs really smooth, simple graphics and clean artwork. could of done with a some more bikes and clothes but for the price its quite reasonable.Well worth the asking price, and if you enjoyed TRIALS you will love this also.a solid 7/10			"

												I got this game in a Bundle Stars Bundle and I really enjoy it! Fun! I used to do some BMX but my body got old and I couldn't handle it. This game is fun and doesn't risk life and limb. Fun tricks, good graphics and animations, customize your bike and helmet.  "

												Fun little game that is perfect for picking up and playing for a couple of minutes.The gameplay is all about momentum, instead of weird puzzle-like platforming (looking at you Trials). So as long a you are able to keep up the speed, you'll be able to some pretty slick moves.It doesn't hurt that it has a neat soundtrack as well. :) "

												Great game please add more realistic level ramp setups, etc. More in depth character & bike customizations, Mod support for creating levels, even just a level editor, etc. Overall could use a graphic & performance, bug fixes and etc, best 2d pc bmx game out there, needs updated though.

												Fun game brought down by simple things like not having  a reset button and menus that kick you into the trick list or to the main screen when trying to restart the level such a shame game is almost perfect just broken in ways that should have been adressed long ago.			"

												I played the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the mobile games, but I was a bit cautious  when I saw Pumped got a Console/PC Port.But all is good, it's really well done, the controls are smooth, the game is very challenging and fun and the music is awesome.If you like OlliOlli, Joe Danger or any of the Trials games, give this a go.Only warning: Needs a controller, unplayable with keyboard imho.
