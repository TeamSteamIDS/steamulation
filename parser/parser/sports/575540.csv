												A lot of fun and shows a lot of promise.  The swing physics seem more forgiving than Gofl Club VR, particularly in the left-right direction.  I would describe it as more ""arcade-y"" which can definitely be a good thing.   I really liked how it would automatically select the most adequate club when placing you by the ball.  I found myself finishing holes very quickly because of this, rarely changing clubs from what it selected.  I did have to turn off the ball follow-cam though, as it can be a bit jarring, thankfully there is a setting for it.The 2 courses currently included are well designed and the graphics are surprisingly good.   I'm excited to see future courses.  If you want a quick, relaxing round of arcade golf VR Golf Online is an excellent choice.  If I was wanting to actually focus on my swing and try to improve it I would play Golf Club VR.  It's good to finally have choices!			"

												I recommend this only because it just came out and the bugs it has should be easlily fixed.  It runs fine but the main problem is being unable to set up your position to hit the ball.  No mater how I start the game and where I stand, the ball is always placed in the same position to Tee off.  So I cannot swing or stand correctly because the ball is always against my computer desk when I need it farther out in the play area.  This is just one of the frustrating fixes that must be dealt with.  Another fix is putting,  there seems to be no aiming adjustment on the green, I can turn the putter in the direction I want the ball to go, but when I hit it the ball goes straight for the cup and misses.  The ball does not go in the direction I have the putter turned, even turned at a 45 degree angle the ball hits straight for the cup and It has the most unrealistic putting sound I have ever heard.  Still if they get these things fixed and improve fairway aiming, this game will get much better.  I hope they fix it soon so I can play.			"

												Pros:Polished UI and feel to the gameCons:The worst thing about the game is that when you hit, the camera follows the ball which made me quite sick.  The devs should consider removing this or defaulting it to being off.  It is nice to see where the ball goes, maybe they could move the camera to a stationary position where the ball will end up? The game mechanics are just not there.  You can literally hit the ball 90 degrees from where the auto aim is pointed and the ball goes where the auto aim has it lined up to go, the only thing you really effect is the swing speed.After getting the ball in the hole you have an uncanny valley view of your avitar walking, then freezing and dissolving which is a bit odd.   The end of the hole guitar music that plays gets very redundant after a couple rounds.All in all this game has potential but needs some fixes. "

												As an avid golfer I found this game to be fun. Pretty good immersion for the VR. The biggest drawbacks have been listed by others before me. There is no understanding of yardage, no understanding of 'feeling'. That aside, if you go in to it to have fun, I think this game accomplishes it. While on sale at 14 bucks, I think it is a pretty good deal and offers enough content to make it worth it.Looking forward to more courses and refinement of the overal play style of the game.Good job Devs!

												Boy, this game needs some work. I think it has potential for being a good VR golf game but some things need to be fixed/added. I've only played one round of golf so far but here are my initial observations. 1. When you tee off or hit any shot for that matter, there is no distance indicator to tell you how far you've hit the ball or how far the ball is traveling while in mid air.2. When the ball lands, there is no indicator to tell you how far the ball went or how far the distance is to the hole.3. The holes do not have a yardage inicator, just the par so you don't know if your par 4 is 320 yards or 400 yards long.4. In options/settings I have YARDAGE and not meters selected but meters is on the scoreboard5. There is an attractive, skinny, tall (too tall actually) girl standing off to your right for every shot. She just stands there. Doesn't talk, give advice, move or help whatsoever. If she is there, give her a purpose other than blinking her eyes.6. The puttings seems to be off. The putting grid gives you a good indicator of the slope of the green and is easy to read but when doing the actual putt I'm off even though I feel like I'm making more than the proper adjustment.7. The courses are barren. No spectators, no crowd, no cheering. Nothing. Just you and the pretty mannequin.8. Maybe there will be more golfers available once you play more but the selection of characters to choose from is sparse. Just four I think.9. Aiming the ball is absolutely horrible. In the tee box for example there is a blue line shooting out from the ball sitting on the tee that will tell you where the ball should go and eventually land. If you don't like where the ball is due to land (due to trees or wind for example) it is very difficult to adjust the trajectory. It should be as simple as using the thumbpad to push the blue trajectory line left or right but they make you use the trigger and the laser pointer which needs to be on some random place in space somewhere above the blue trajectory line. Hunting for that spot to grab onto is an exercise in futility and I was only able to grab it a handful of times and on those times I could only move the line in one direction. Unfortunately, it was usually in the opposite direction I wanted to go so I was in the rough A LOT.10. The clubs have no yardage indicator. I'm going to say that again. The golf clubs do not tell you how far they should be hitting the ball. When you take a shot the game automatically has your club selected. So for example I tee off on a par 4 and land in the rough. The game might have a 9 iron selected for me but I dont know three things, how far I am from the pin, how far a 9 iron will go and if the rough will shorten my normal hitting distance for a 9 iron. You need to know these things when adjusting for your approach shot. Simply terrible these things are not included.11. The second controller seems to have no input or purpose even though it is in the game and can be seen. Give that controller some purpose like aiming your shot or moving where the ball is in your real room.12. I touched on it in item 11 but the ball is placed in the center of your real room with no way to move it. In order to hit the ball in my fairly large space I need to be on the opposite side of my computer, 4 additional feet away from the center of the room with the cord from my headset pulling at my head as well as getting in the way of my arms during my swing. There should be a way to move the ball  forward toward your computer so YOU and not the ball is in the center of your play space. This would give the headset cord enough slack to not get in your way during your swing or have you backed up against the far edge of your playing space.13. The single player mode doesn't have any sort of leaderboard or competition. Have some sort of virtual opponents maybe.There is more I'm sure I can come up with but as I said I've only played one game and these are just my initial observations. Very disappointing since I was really looking forward to buying and playing this one. I do understand this is a work in progress so I really hope the developers read this and take into account what I wrote here. The game needs much more than what it has right now. I do think that once more content is added and improvements are made it will be a very good game. It just isn't right now. I will keep an eye on this game and play it more and adjust my review if things change in the game.			"

												The best online multiplayer vr golf game in the market till now. Sense of 'out in the field' is great, swing is easy and real and feels good,  Improvement is reqired for some sound and characters. If you feel dizzy with the flying cam, you have to turn it off in the option ( I did )			"
