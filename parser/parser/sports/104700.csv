												Okay, so after finally pouring 100 hours into this game in such a small time, I've decided to actually write a review on this game now. This review is rather lengthly. Sorry for being boring.This is not a pay to win.First off, the description for this game is outdated. It is not updated weekly, and has been 'abandoned' by the developers. There has not been an update since early 2013. Uber Entertainment said multiple times on their forums that if they have a small chance to revive the game, they will. For now, they shall focus on bigger projects. Let's hope they keep that promise. Now to the review.After acquiring over 100 hours, I can say this game is PURE HELL to get into. The game has been 'dead' or rather, has a low playerbase, and has done for about 2 years now. There are the occasional new players, but they don't stick around after what they find.The BadSo, before you decide whether or not to play this game, or dive in blind and think 'Yeah! This'll be great and fun!' I'm going to post all the negatives so you don't have to experience them getting thrown at your face first hand.1. The CommunityAs I have previously stated, the playerbase for this game is rather at a low. Due to this factor, you'll find most players you run into will be fully geared to the teeth (completely cosmetics.. except for endorsements, but we'll get to that). Now, I'm not saying every experienced player in this game is a huge butt, but most of them are.You'll find people will find ways to get angry in almost any situation. Whether their team is winning or losing. They'll find ways to insult you, no matter how. Be it your interests, name, how you type/play. You name it.I'll probably go as far to say the community on this game is worse than Dota 2 or League of Legends. However, this doesn't mean you can find... ""nice"" players to run into. I can name a few, but I won't mention any names in this review to respect people's privacy.2. EndorsementsOkay, so. Endorsements! I'll give you a quick run down on what they are.In SMNC, you start off at level 0. Every 4 levels, you unlock a new Endorsement slot, getting up to 25 slots in total. You can go above the level 100 mark, but this will not unlock any endorsement slots.Now, Endorsements themselves are small buffs with a positive advantage, and a negative disadvantage. These can be bought with coins, and are permenant, so you can buy and keep as many as you like. Mixing and matching different Endorsements at level 100 can help in giving you a huge advantage against players.Now, here's the thing.As I have previously explained, playerbase is rather low. So you'll be finding if you're a new player straight off the bat, you'll be running into all these powerful and experienced pros... With all of their Endorsement slots filled.This feature alone is probably one of the single handed reasons along with the community that I hate this game.3. MatchmakingNow, this is what I feel to be one of the game's biggest flaws.As explained above, most of the community is experienced players. Now, if you get new players joining, or less experienced ones, this won't change anything. Matchmaking is COMPLETELY random. It won't pair you up against players based on their level/skill/endorsement sets, it'll just drag and drop you into a list and not care.This leads to cases such as having a completely new team, fight against a team of experienced players.. Utterly getting slaughtered in the process.4. Conclusion of Bad PointsAs you may have guessed just by reading this...This game is incredibly hard to get into. To the point of masochism. It's easy to get stressed out over the various negatives at this game.Now, you may be wondering... Why did I go through with it? Why did I continue to play, despite the horrible negatives?The GoodI can't deny it. This game is special. Something is so fun and quirky about it.1. The Atmosphere. I'll get this out of the way first.Simply put, this game has an amazing atmosphere. A futuristic combat sport set in an arena, crowd going wild, announcers with funny voice lines, fitting situations well. What's not to love?The Crowd is dynamic. Say if you were to make a kill, make something happen, or an event happens in the map, the crowd will respond. Being either cheers of joy, or jeers of disappoint.The Announcers are fun to listen to. They sometimes share interesting stories, talk about what is happening in the match, and will respond to any kills/killstreaks/annihilator use. It all feels so real, and well done. The voice acting is great in this game. That is undeniable.2. Gameplay itselfMost people end up mistaking this game for a third person shooter... and end up raging in the process.Though it may feel strange or possibly even unnatural at first, SMNC has a really great feel once you get the hang of it. A MOBA with Third Person Shooter hybrid elements? At the time, it was pretty new. Fresh, too. I'm not sure if there have been any since.Each pro has three abilities, all bound to SHIFT, Q and E by default. It's simple, really. Each pro is easy to understand, and there are many to choose from.. Although there are no longer 'free pro rotations'. I've had fun playing a lot of them though!All in all, I feel like this is one of those games where you have to 'play it yourself to understand' it.3. Conclusion of Good PointsI honestly don't think I really need much of a conclusion here, as most of it is explained above. I can give a bit of advice though.You can't learn if you don't play, so keep on trying! And play for fun. Ignore the occasional butthead you might come across who will call you a 'feeder' or a 'noob' or anything of the sort.And that concludes my Super Monday Night Combat Review! If you've read this far, I'm amazed. Thank you for reading, as I appreciate it. Sorry if I might've bored you though. Have fun playing! I hope "

												I wanted to enjoy SMNC back when it actually had people. I couldn't though for the same reasons that's driving new players away today.There are two reasons. The first being the complete lack of matchmaking via skill/experience. This should have been priority for an MOBA where extreme teamwork is important. Match the players who were new with the other players who were new and the more experienced against the more experienced! This should have just been common sense. Uber did not make this a priority and SMNC lost a lot of the players who would have been really interested in this game when it first came on steam.The other reason I stopped playing was because of the pile of dogshit this game calls a community and the fact that I hear it's gotten worse as the game dwindled down to a small one tells me that the absolute death of SMNC is imminent.You would think that the small veteran community nowadays would band together, grow up, and attempt to build the playerbase by ACTUALLY BEING PLEASENT TO PLAY WITH, but no. Let's all be a bunch of angry ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and dig the hole a bit deeper with every single match until there is literally no one who wants to play this game.The terrible matchmaking early on wasn't enough to make me stop playing, but the horrible attitudes of the community along with it was enough to make me uninstall. So congrats there, veteran community. You keep driving away any chance of this game making a comeback because you can't stop being ♥♥♥♥♥ to the new players (and eachother) who might have actually enjoyed this game all because you want to, ""win"".Well congrats! ""Your winner""! What's the prize? AN EMPTY GAME TO GO WITH YOUR INFERIORITY COMPLEX!+1 for getting the Big Rigs reference.			"

												Don't let the lack of players stop you from playing this game. Yes it is true, the community is mostly dead and those who are still here are way better than you are. Play it anyway. I'll explain why, and then I will explain how.Why should you play SMNC even though it has no population and you will get spanked:The SuperCrossfire mode came out in spring of 2012 and there is still nothing like it. SuperCrossfire is intense, and will make you incredibly angry, but it is the most satisfying game I have ever player. Don't play SuperCrossfire, PLAY TURBOCROSS. When you see these reviews saying that they can't get into matches, or get into them infrequently, they are talking about SuperCrossfire which requires a full team before the match begins. In a perfect world, we could play that mode, but the world sucks so we have to play TurboCross. Even though TurboCross is watered down SuperCrossfire, it still has no equivalent. Believe me, if I could find a third-person shooter MOBA with jumping, dodging, grapples, and class-synergy, then I would be playing it instead (assuming that more people played it). Here is the low-down, Uber spent millions on this game and it shows. Unfortunately, they didn't make money from it so it has been abandoned. But again, there just isn't anything like it and what it does is amazing.The basic idea is that you and your team are supposed to help your bots advance in two lanes in order to take down the shields of enemy turrets and eventually take down the money-ball. There are two lanes, so even though you may be pushing one really hard, you have to worry about how the other is doing. All of the maps are symetrical. Now, a lot of players just don't understand how important it is to kill bots. Killing bots is the most effective method of winning the game. Of course the other team will try to kill you while you do it, and you don't want that to happen. Why don't you want that to happen? because while you are dead, you kill less bots. Kill bots, push your lane, take out their turrets once the shield is down, do the same to the money ball. If you see that the other lane is having the same done to it by the other team, switch lanes and push it back to atleast the middle. Oh I forgot to explain why this is fun. It's amazing. When you and 1-3 other teammates are pushing a lane together and you make progress even though the other team is trying to kill you, you feel like you are making something happen. This is a different feeling than coming in first in a race or having a high kill-to-death ratio. Pushing a lane is slow and must me sustained. When I die, I worry about how far back my lane is going to get pushed and whether or not we will be able to push it back to where it was. It's different than k/d, it just is. Other third-person shooters just don't offer this. How to play with a low population:Play a Pickup game of Turbocross on the North American server after 5pm EST preferably on the weekend. Yes, I know that this is limiting, but it's what you have to do to play this game that no one else has made yet and is ahead of its time. It will take maybe 10 minutes to find your first game, but after that you are in rhythm, so most of the players of your last game will show up for the next. You will see the same names on different days, there are not many of us. Be nice because you will see them again. They will not be nice to you, I am sorry. Stay near your team and kill-bots. Stay on one lane until you know the maps. Eventually you should ask someone what the annihilator is. Good luck. If people knew what this game was like, there would be a lot of people playing it, but it looks like Team Fortress 2 and when it don't play in a similar way, folks think it is a bad game. SMNC has major flaws, but there just isn't anything like it and what it does is valuable.			"

												2 Years after this game being abandoned by the Devs, people still play it AND there's no game like SMNC, it's a one of a kind game that needs to be known more.The game can't really be dead, because there's people like myself who don't want to let this game go, it's a really special flower that won't ever die.Besides the low population, what else does this game offer, quite a lot actually!Pros:Lots of pros! (Heros) all of them bring unquie styles of gameplay, like the quick moving Assassin, to the grapple monster Veteran, to the beatboxing Robo Hobo, to the charging Tank, to the bot pushing Leo and a lot more!Like I mentioned, this game is one of a kind, a 3rd person shooter MOBA with lots of bots you can spawn, like Fuji bots, Bouncers and the Jackbot.The commentators are some of the best in gaming, both feel genuine and are so much fun to listen to, I never get tired of thier lines, despite listening to them over a thousand times.A lot of music! From hawaiian music, rock and roll, digital music, banjos and a lot more!Mascots who give you bonus items! Like Bullseye gives you money, churros and Bacon! Juicebot who gives you fruit which fills up your juice meter! And Chicky Cantor who gives you a huge boost when you defeat him.You can get some free items and boosters! You can connect your Facebook profile to SMNC and get a free assault kit! Which includes the FIreball set, 2 taunts and I think a booster too! There's also a guide which gives codes for boosters too!

Unquie looking maps!Has a unquie sporty feel that no other game has created so far.Voice acting is really good and the personality of the characters are great! (Except Gunslinger who is boring and Combat Girl who is just a Sterotype and boobs)Cons:The low population  (Like I mentioned) and the only gamemodes you will be able to play is Turbocross and Blitz, Supercross is 100% dead, you have a higher chance to win the lottery then to find a Supercross match, Blitz is also hard to find matches, speak with players in the chat and see if they want to play, also the most common players you will come across play this game a lot and stomp games over and over, or new players who have no clue what to do... speaking of which...Very steep learning curve, this game is hard to learn due to the lack of a good tutorial, there is one called Training Camp, but you don't learn anything major, like Products, Endorsments, which pros are more deadly or HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO KILL BOTS!(Judging by Turbocross since Super is dead) The balance is all over the place, all the heros (Except Leo and the Veteran) have something OP in them, from Gunner's rocket, Tank's Grenades and charges, Karl's burst, Gunslinger's r*t*rded DPS, Support's Airstrikes, Combat Girl's and Megabeth's.... EVERYTHING! There is at least one OP thing about most Pros, and you will notice them quickly.Do not buy any items, you can unbox most of them thanks to a glitch, if you use a key on a chest/crate/treasure ball, the key doesn't disappear, meaning you can get thousands of rare items.The community is bad, mostly filled with as*h*les who complain and b**ch about everything, there are nice people, like when I came back to this game, a friend gave me some items! Thanks again!Small amount of maps, there's Gun Mountain, Loco Moco, Bullet Gorge, Downtown Spunky, Grenade Arena (My fav,) the Training Camp, and the Blitz map, the normal maps have tons of exploits of them, like Downtown Spunky Megabeth can rocket jump onto a building and attack all the turrets below, Loco Moco's mid can be spammed by Sniper pros and Supports, you can attack the money ball UNDER the map with Assault on Grenade Arena and more. Plus Gun Mountain is the worst map in the game, for $750 you can activate Shelly, aka clear a lane with no effort.The Devs are very shady, while they said they cannot update this game due to the lack of funding, they went on to kickstarter and got their next game funded called Planetary Annihilation, during 2014 they attempted to fund another game called Human Resources, however Planetary Annihilation wasn't close to being finished as it was missing promises from the Kickstarter, which was one of the biggest reasons why Human Resources fell, addtionally they ditched the orignal MNC IN THE SAME YEAR IT WAS RELEASED ON STEAM FOR THIS GAME! As of right now they have pretty much been silent with MNC franchise, just a word of warning when you buy some of their products as they aren't trustworthee, sorry Uber but you lost A LOT of trust with A LOT of customers.Overall this game is one of a kind, lots of upsides and downsides, and I can understand why you don't enjoy this, but give this game a chance, hard to learn, but a lot of fun in the end.If you want to see the current population check the link below.http://steamcharts.com/app/104700 "

												Its dead jim, but seriously it was good at one point then the devs decided not to update the game anymore. The Good1. Maps are pretty good and well designed (with supercross in mind) 2. Character balance for the most part is alright3. Good skill ceilingThe Bad1. Small playerbase that is divided by 3 seperate game modes (try dividing 50 players into supercross, turbocross, and blitz)2. Supercross thier bread and butter of the game is dead. Why is this bad you may ask, its because all of the maps, characters, and even products are balanced around this gamemode. (hell even the bots are balanaced for supercross)3. The team comp in higher level play will allways have a assault simply because he deals high damage from a far range, can chase and the sky is the limit for him. His jetpack recharges rediculously fast and it can be angled to go higher then intended by  charging into ramps or by granade jumping. Using the jetpack has no set backs for assault, no aiming penalty like in the first game. TL;DR Assault is OP. 4. Massive Air is still a broken product that they haven't fixed even though it was reported months ago. To put it simply it turns a bad player into a mediocoure one, by speeding them up (which was unintended) and making them harder to grapple (another unintended side effect). To people that don't know what Massive Air is its one of the products in the game that was only intended to give you better jump control. 5. While I'm on the subject of products most of the products in the game are useless. A product to the people that never played this game are passives which activate on certian conditions and even only activate on certain levels. (example parting gift, it activates from level 1 and on and only activates on your death, it heals your team for 350 health and scales with the teamates level) You will only see the products money magnet, juicy spunky, and over armor being used in this game in higher level play or Massive Air for the above reason. Any other product is seldomly used.6. If you took a look at the chowder (beta builds for SMNC) forums, the devs never really listioned to the people who were trying to balance the game, they instead opted to make more characters and more gamemodes instead of fixing the pressing problems in the game which I listed some above. (also one of the devs got wrecked in a beta scrim and opted to nerf veteren out of spite and not game balance)7. The community has divided into two parts, super try hards and people who just wanna have fun, the sad part is the latter part of the community for the most part is dying off or going to other games. Really don't bother unless your are decient at the game which can only happen if you managed to play it before supercross died off for good.8. This is probiblly the killer of the game but doesnt apply anymore since the ques for supercross are dead but still could bring to light why supercross is dead. At level 0-20 when you first get the game you are put into ques with people of your own skill level (aka a newbie camp) so you dont have to worry about vets stomping you. The moment you reached level 21 you are put into the general que and many many people would get stomped, causing them to quit the game because they weren't ready. 9. The in game voice chat is dead, and has been dead for over a year now. (stopped working Novemember 2012) The devs still didn't fix this issue.10. The game hasn't been patched for almost a year from me writing this review even though they got a volunteer to fix the bugs in the game (apperently they messed up the coding really really really badly in unreal 3) said bug fixes from the volunteer never got into SMNC, and the only person who was working on the bug fixes got reassigned to work on thier other game Planetary Anhilation.11. The free character roster has been the same 6 characters for 9 months from me writing this review, the rouster is supposed to change weekly to let people try out the 18 characters before they buy them.All in all DON'T PLAY THIS GAME UNTILL UBER FIXES IT (which sadly will be never).

												Since Steam had the gall to recc me this game in the new Steam Discovery update, I thought I'd write a review of the game in it's current state since it's abandonment. This game used to be GREAT. I bought Monday Night Combat a few months before Super MNC was released, and enjoyed a few hours of it but never got into it addictively. When Super MNC came out I was all over it. It was free2play, had a lot more options, characters, and got quite a bit of hype from a tie-in with Team Fortress 2 and one of the first games to incorporate Steam trading. It had a multitude of modes, a competitive but somewhat friendly community, and there were little to no problems besides a few occasional glitches to ruin the experience. Then the devs/publishers threw the community under the bus. They insisted while they were working on Planetary Annihilation that they'd continue support for this game, even if it meant just minor updates/champ rotation/fixes. But they outright lied, and never officially announced abandoning the game and left the cash shop open. The matchmaking is completely broken, there's some BS number in-game that states how many players are on, and the community is just a few random vets with complete newbies who have no idea the game is dead, with a huge gap of experience/character upgrades between these two groups.Uber is by no means a helpless small indie developer that doesn't have the resources to continue support for this game. Uber received over 2 million US dollars in Kickstarter money (with a project goal of 900k) for their new game, Planetary Annihilation, which has turned out into a slight disappointment in my opinion; although a few people in the Steam User Forums will insist the game's poor performance and their promise of offline -play is only because ""they [Uber Entertainment] just needs more money/time"". After receiving this large sum of money, Uber also charged $90 for alpha access to those who did not donate to their Kickstarter, and $50 for beta, all the while keeping silent on Super MNC and continuing to let it rot. This gives you an idea of Uber's recent shortcomings although you're free to look into them yourself and come to your own conclusions.Another recent Super MNC reccomendation writer stated that Uber has stated on their forums they have interest in reviving this game if ""given the chance"", but they've had plenty and I hope these are not empty words. I'd love to continue to convert friends back to this game, even if Uber didn't do content updates but fixed matchmaking and updated Pro rotation.			"

												At this point in time, I cannot recommend this game to anyone.For starters, it has been abandoned by the creators.  The game revolves around a set of classes, or ""pros"".  Back in its heyday, the pros would be a free rotation, where 5-6 of them were free, a few of them were on sale, and the others were full price.  Since it was abandoned, the free pros haven't rotated at all.  This leaves you backed into a corner of hoping you enjoy one of the free pros, or spending money on a pro you have no idea you'll like.  Not that I recommend you even get that far.Secondly, the community is completely cannibalistic.  In higher population games, this isn't a problem.  This genre in particular (MOBAs), has quite an inclination to rage fits, ♥♥♥♥ talking, and general immaturity even more-so than you'll experience in Call of Duty.  Again, in higher populated communities, this isn't a big deal, you'll just move on to another game and have less than a .01% chance of running into the same jackass twice.  Well, SMNC has less than 200 active at peak times, and all the people playing this game are a rotating cast of alphas, betas, and pro players.  So if you like getting your ♥♥♥ kicked by the same pub stomp team over and over again, dive in!The chief game mode this was designed around doesn't even function anymore, due to low population/lack of interest from alpha/beta/pro players.  They would rather instant-gib you on the more deathmatch like ""Turbocross"" game mode.  There's a sick sense of enjoyment they get from stomping the ever living ♥♥♥♥ out of new players, regardless of the fact that this drives them away within an hour of play.  If you don't believe me, sit in on them while they converse on mumble, or spend a few minutes on the Uberent forums.So, if you like getting stomped, an impossible learning curve, horrendous population/matchmaking, and no further development from the company, this game is for you.  In its prime, SMNC was unique, fun, and had an awesome community to be a part of.  Calling it a shadow of it's former self would be an understatement.  A year or two ago, this game was a 5/5.  Now, it's a 1/5.  Tawokwww.GuildLeaders.com "

												This game was cool when it first launched and was in ""Beta"". Then it turned into one of those infinite betas that never actually finished but still had a premium cash shop you could spend real money on anyways.Before finishing the game Uber decided to start work on Planetary Annihilation, after which Super MNC died and was taken over by trolls and whiny teenagers. Co-incidentally to this review (not) Uber recently ""launched"" Planetary Annihilation, another unfinished product that doesn't even have offline single player or the ability to save skirmishes against AI. (I do hear it has the ability to crash, or run at less than 60 frames per second 99% of the time.)At this point, I say avoid Uber's games, they take money for unfinished products and then move on to their next cash grab.Inb4 Uber announces a new game before finishing PA or Super MNC. (Hah, finish this game? Uber abandoned it a year ago, that's not gonna happen.)Edit: Only one month later than I wrote this review Uber announced their latest game, Human Resources. Once again they are Kickstarting a new game before any of their old games have been finished. I really want to like their games, they look really cool, but they're all unfinished.			"

												SMNC is a game I really want to recommend, but I cannot. While I have enjoyed this game for well over a hundred hours, the developers (Uber) are no longer creating content for the game. The source code has been given to someone outside the company who is not being paid for his work and therefore content patches are nearly non-existent. On top of this, there are still numerous issues within the game and the fact that the community is also nearly non-existent does not help; SMNC was quite popular at one point, but now since the dev's don't care and are working on another game (namely Planetary Annihilation) many players have obviously left for greener pastures, myself included. Overall, the IP has great character and I truly enjoyed my time with SMNC, however I cannot reccomend it any longer.			"

												I will never forgive UberENT for what they did to this game. At one point this game was an incredible ammount of fun and I'll always remember the pure joy it brought to me. But a combination of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ monetization and poor development ultimatly killed. This ♥♥♥♥ could have been big, it could have been amazing. It was out way before Overwatch and Smite, it could have been a MMO giant. The potential was enourmous and I will never be not mad at UberENT for dropping the ball so hard.			"

												Don't even bother. This game is a waste. The game itself was good. It was really fun. However, pretty much no one plays it now. It's a miracle if you find a match to play in, because there is no one online. The game is so dead, I'm surprised it is still on the Steam store to be honest. I mean, you can't even access your inventory on Steam anymore, which I know will have upset many of the past players of this game as a lot of players will have put money into the game. If this game ever somehow has a massive revival, then I for one will be playing it again, but that doesn't look likely, and quite frankly, it's a huge waste, because this game was brilliant. It's an absolute pity.			"

												SMNC, the sleeper hit I ended up loving dearly. It's a huge shame Uber has a habit of making games and never fleshing them out. This could have been an extremely popular game if they didn't abandon it. While ""MOBAs"" are not for everyone, this one combines FPS elements into the core game. This makes for the best FPS/MOBA on the market in my opinion. There has never been another game I've ever enjoyed as much as this one. FPS or MOBA. Please Uber I'm begging you, come back to your red-headed step child and give it the love and care it needs to flourish.			"

												Well, after so many hours I can say without any hesitation that I know about 100% this game has to offer.I was there when it came out of beta, I saw it being developed, I saw it fall... slowly. It was and still is quite a ride. I know its history, I kinda know people who play, not personally, mostly in the arena and chat, all of them have unique play styles even those I despise. I just want to say ""this game is awesome"", but that just wouldn't be enough.So, without further delay.Super Monday Night Combat,  a third person blood sport arena shooter pact with adrenaline and excitement. Taking place in a distant future with 17 unique characters (pros) to choose from, all with unique skills and abilities. From slow and tanky to fast and slicy, thrown into one of the 5 arenas to fight for money and fame.Good things:The graphics are satisfying, with plenty of options to modify in your menu so even those coal running pcs can handle it.Sound, sound effects and music is clear, fun and spot on. The characters, their abilities, their weapons and map hazzards make unique sounds that are clear which is very important considering the fast pased gameplay. Even the announcers are helpful as they give you tips, inform you if something important happens or about to happen.Gameplay is fast paced and responsive as long you have at least decent connection.It has a tutorial level, training camp where you find basic information.No way to boost your gameplay performance with real money, you have to play and buy such items with in game currency, basicly no pay to win bs.Teamwork is encouraged.Bad things: The developers no longer support this game. The servers are up and not comming down any time soon as far as I know. Support with technical issues is still up too if you find yourself in troble with something. But the further game development has stopped.Population is low, still you find games in turbocross only which takes a few minutes at day time, but there aren't enough people for supercross or in general.A few bugs here and there but nothing critical, just annoying.Can't think of anything else bad. Nothing else bothers me.Conclusion:3rd person view team arena combat filled with fast paced gameplay. This game can be compared to Battleborn and Smite, but still has its own unique taste. It is free, easy to set up and get going, but hard to master. If you like something like that or would like to try, then this game is definitely for you..			"

Super Monday Night Combat is an innovative, third-person arena shooter.Pros: Graphics, Sound, Controls, GameplayCons: CommunityFrom the sleek Assassin to the hulking Jackbot, the graphics look superb.  The music and sound mesh well with the gameplay, with the roaring crowd, gunfire, and cheeky advertisements.  A controller or a keyboard and mouse work very well.  Finally and above all else, Super Monday Night Combat is simply fun, standing out among numerous FPS clones and DotA-style mobas with unique and challenging mechanics.However, one simple flaw serves to demolish all fun to be had: the community has dwindled, leaving Super MNC's pick-up-and-play style a thing of the past.7/10			"

												How to play this game:1: download the game2: Play it till lvl 20 when you get the pyro hat.3: Uninstall the game.Some tips:+Play Blitz. Blitz is the fastest way of leveling up+Invite everyone to your game, the more the people the more experience everyone gets.+Ask your team for tips. Everyone is there for the hats and everyone wants to get out of that game the fastest way posible+Use these two codes in the game store: 4070-9098 2718-2818 They will give you an experience boost and shorter the suffering.+The matchmaking is garbage so be patient.+Mute the comentator. And put your favorite music while you play. The voice chat doesnt work so you'll only miss their obnoxious and tacky comments.Also this game is stupid, the character designs are horrible, the matchmaking sucks, the game is stupid x2, the help are text walls, there are missoginistic jokes in, the community is full of people who just wants the pyro hat and toxic tryhards there was a lot of potential in this game but it was wasted in stupid decisions.

												Well I think it's safe to say the game is dead now, which is a shame because it's still one of the best MOBA's out there, and it's still a ton of fun if you can find a match with full teams. It's a shame the developer abandoned it, as it would still be alive and well if they didn't just bail for focus on Planetary Annihilation (I'm pretty sure they bailed on the initial build of that and ""re-released"" the same game for an additional cost for the initial buyers). Had they kept updating this, they likely would have had funds for future failures elsewhere, but they would have kept this gem and it's community alive. I recommend it because it was an awesome game, but you'll need to be patient with it if you want to find a match to play now.			"

												This is a class based 3rd person shooter along the lines of a MOBA. I've given it a shot 3 times and really, it just failed to capture my interest like TF2 did. Its got quirky characters, a good art style and fun weapons, its just I'd rather be playing TF2. Like a MOBA game, there are bots on each map that allow you to level up your character so you can actually have a level advantage over other players on the map. So basically attack bots and avoid players until you get a level advantage to take out players all while collecting experience. Its a good system, it just made me want to play TF2. There is a lot of player customization too, which is nice, but eh.While I have only played 15 or so hours, I felt that spawn killing was far too common, because so many new fresh players come to Super MNC hoping to get TF2 hats that they don't understand how to play. A skilled player can just dominate an entire map and one player can overpower an entire team. The tutorial was pretty bad and I didn't really still didn't understand the game upon my 3rd time playing it. I feel a lot of people must not understand it, because there are players asking what they do or why the other 'players' are so dumb they walk into shots fired, when they don't understand the 'players' are bots, not actual humans.Really, just get your TF2 hats and get out or don't bother playing this game. TF2 is a superior game, but if you understand MOBAs and love 3rd person shooters. Then this game is totally for you.			"

												Like almost everyone who plays this game, I came for the TF2 hats. And to be honest, I was pleasantly surprised at how fun it was. I especially liked the co-op mode, which is like MvM in TF2 except infinitely less stressful and more fun. In fact, the only reason (granted, quite a major reason) that I'm not giving it a thumbs-up is that it's essentially dead. Its developers have adandoned the project entirely, and the last time new content was added was about 3 years ago. That means that almost nobody's on, and the few that are tend to be salty tryhards that are too stubborn to admit the game is long dead. Valve, while not necessarily taking into consideration the desires of the community, constantly updates TF2, and for that reason it's more fun overall. My advice is to only download this game for the hats, and avoid spending money on taunts and cosmetics.			"

												Ladies and Gentlemen.I would like to present:ALPHA MONDAY NIGHT COMBAT.I can't really describe how much potential Monday Night Combat title had. UberEnt really ruined it.If you want to play something FAST PACED, then I recommend simple, Monday Night Combat. SMNC is nothing more than Alpha MNC. A lot of good stuff were implemented but a lot of stuff were also ruined.Same goes with the prices. First introduce GOLDEN GUNS - 10$. A 10$ for a F-ing CHEAP Photoshop edit.Not to mention how many times UberEnt scammed people. Some people ACTUALLY PAID for ASSAULT PACK (from store) but suddenly they decided to give Facebook users ASSAULT PACK for FREE.Don't spend any cents on any UberEnt titles. They will ruin more games.Sincerely- Coverop			"

												---Let's be fair: I am primarily just writing this ""review"" as a retrospective rather than ""should I give money to this game""-essay.I'd say it's still worth writing this, so here goes:------Here are some bullet-points why I don't recommend this game:- You can only queue in a single queue at the time.Before the more or less accidental release from the closed-beta-phase, there was a time you could queue on all regions / servers / datacenters.Granted, there was only single game-mode also, the ""SuperCrossfire"".Had this been feature however re-added as they UberEnt wanted to, the queueing would have been a lot less of hassle.Here is a link with a  screenshot with ""Ekanaut"" himself more or less confirming they wanted to re-implement the feature:https://forums.uberent.com/threads/remove-region-player-counts.30497/#post-448477- Imbalanced ""Meta""Primarily this goes to actual ""meta""-things called ""Products"", since you cannot equip or otherwise buy & get inside battles itself (same things are with ""Endorsement"").To put it simply: There were a lot on Products / Passive-buff that either were for the most part really useless (especially the ""Death & Respawn-effects"" like ""Snappy Comeback"" that gave 30-seconds run-speed-buff every time you respawned; an very counter-productive-buffs you for the most part don't want to die at all in this game);and simply over-powered(E.G.""Hot Hands"" that has the base damage of 20-damage/second for 5-second-period to each enemy you grapple / grapples you every 10-seconds; only way you could semi-counter this as to either have a ""pocket-medic""-team or using a product called ""Asbestos"" which in practice halved the burn-durations).((I may have some numbers slightly wrong. But point still stands some products were simply far too over-powerful...))Aside for the Death and respawn-products, these meta-buffs didn't have a counter / downside-effect (aside maybe for the Respawn + Death-products), so it was for the most part pointless to ""not"" carry all the three product-slots filled.- Exploits and generally UberEnt-folks endorsing thisRanging from far too easy spawn-point-camping (both player and bot / ""minion""-spawns) to players going to out-of-reach-spots where they're for the most completely safe (especially flying to those places with character called ""Assault"".Biggest exploit being ""turret / ""tower""-cheesing"", which means damage the turret out-of-the-reach or otherwise from angles the turrets cannot counter at all (primarily by ""clipping"" gun-models through walls or poking behind corners, since the turret / towers only aim the center the of the character-models).In all scenarios the developers for most part simply say ""Git gud!"", to summarize it best.Exploits itself probably described the ""majority"" of the players the best: If it helped them to win, they did it, always.Actually, the player-spawn points ""deserve"" its own section:The biggest flaw of it was that it only had three very narrow doorways (like you could barely fit two player-characters next to each other next to these, or maybe you couldn't at all (or at least this is how it seemed)).Due how narrow these doorways are, for the most part players inside the ""spawn-dome"" had pretty much zero-chances to fight back the campers outside, especially if there was extra walls nearby to hide behind (""Bullet Gorge""-arena being the worst offender of this by even allowing higher-ground vantage-points thanks to jump-pads!).And considering how really easily / abruptly the ""primary""-mode (""SuperCrossfire"") ""snowballed"", it was simply just horrid...---There are few things however that still makes me wish we could remake or otherwise revive this game:+ Replay-functionSure, it wasn't the most intuitive just like replay-systems generally are. But it's far more better than having no replay-system at all.+ Player-charactersDefinitely the biggest draw of the whole game was the character-roster. Pretty much everything is just right; just right; I really find anything that one could ""improve""-about them (aside maybe related to following thing).And my goodness, the animation: Even in 2016 I've yet to see as perky or otherwise this good'&'smooth ""cartoon"" animation.Whoever people part of the animation-team(s), I really hope to see more games with these animation (styles?).I just wish they could have included rest / all of the old animations plus lines from the previous game (""Old"" Monday Night Combat (1)) (mainly the lip-sync and such).+ World, Lore, WhatnotsIn semi-symbiosis with the character-roster is the world-building.From the arenas itself to announcer / commenter-talk / banter, this game certainly feels like a real universe instead of just a game with random characters that just happens to be there. I.E. the characters actually feel like having a genuine purpose there fighting / being gladiators in these arenas (I.E. to simply put: They're specifically constructed clones(?) fighting for the entertainment of people watching).Basically, for the most part I don't question at all why this all is happening (at least I don't; heck I'd be more than happy to watch sapient(?)-gorillas duking out with ""Leonardo Da Vinci"" all day, if I could that is).+ The gameplay-itself was actually goodExploits aside, the gameplay itself was really good.They could have made the gameplay-better by making the exploits not worth (E.G: making turrets take less damage the further you were away from them, alongside not pushing with bots / ""minions"").But otherwise the pacing, abilities / skills (aside maybe for the lack of ""telegraphing"" or other indicators / tell-tales), everything gameplay-wise was actually solid and really-really good,Best thing was of course that bot / ""minion""-kills were shareable; as long as you kept damaging / ""tagging"" them, you had a chance to get a bot-kill thus level-up plus get money for in-battle-purchases.I personally think relating all damage to singular ""damage-rating""-stats was actually quite clever.In case you'll more info what I am talking about, I have a quite detailed guide written about it:

((I highly recommend reading the UberEnt-forum version too for more up-to-date / non-""link-rot""-version of the guide.))And of course, it was an actual 3-dimensional ""Shooter MOBA"" with Z-axis and such; jumping especially had a purpose (primarily to dodge ground-slam-shock-waves).------So yeah, Super Monday Night Combat ""was"" a good game at the base.But unfortunately the developers failed / were apparently not willing to to make this game more fair-and-square and fun to to play (true, fun is subjective thing).At least the players who got for the most part those who got spawn-camped, cheesed, or otherwise beaten due exploits for the most part more than likely didn't have fun.---------			"

												My best MOBA experience.  But it died due to a short lived balance issue that was more minor than most balance issues in MOBAs out there.  Namely Smite as a whole, Dota 2's time of Troll Warlord or Juggernaut = automatic win, or League's current toxic instant death on low cooldowns meta.  We really need to repopulate this game so it'll get worked on again so League and Smite will stop getting the playerbases they don't deserve.			"

												OMG This game is awesome! A little bit of a learning curve at 1st and definitely very team based gamplay but fun as hell. I'm totally addicted!.Edit/Update...Too bad, once again Uber totally gives the finger to everyone who supported and loved this game and they walked away and abandoned, left it to die. They did the same thing with the 1st Monday night combat and I will never play or support anything again that Uber Ent. has anything to do with. I spent over $1000 on SMNC. Uber can eat a ♥♥♥♥.			"

												A great and funny game.Though this is free to play you have NO possibility to buy ingame advantages.You can use your steam wallet's cash to buy great looking armor and weapons. This stuff has no influence on your stats.You can also buy boosters but they are totally worthless and won't influence much. :-) So don't worry.This game is more about tactic than about going after kills. The more of the enemy bots you kill the faster you level up. 2nd is you shouldn't get killed. Third is: Destroy the enemy.If you are interested in this game, just try it. It is free anyway. Just one important thing:DO NOT START SUPER CROSSFIRE GAME MODE.Because of the small playerbase it will take forever to get a match at Super Crossfire. Just play TURBOCROSS. You will find matches even faster. Sometimes I have to exit the lobby and restart so I get a match after about 2 minutes. But that's really the worst case scenario.There are even some nice guides.

												Ehh...Ehh...I don't know, this is the kind of game I wish steam would add a 'maybe' recommend button for. So ima lean towards the 'No' button and let 2~5 people downvote this before reading. Anyways, It's like TF2 but it didn't trap me into it as well. I'd still recommend giving it a shot, it's still fairly fun and there are a few people who still play it...at the right time of day. It's just more of a race of 'who can make the next TF2 clone' to me. Most recently was Loadout and now Blizzard is making Overwatch...Not that it's bad, I just wish people published more unique games rather then making re-makes based off of another hit game.			"

												This is a great game, if you know what you're doing. Fast paced lane action, I think this combines FPS and MOBA almost flawlessly (with the exception of getting oneshot by the turrets :P) Learn each of the different classes (pros in this game) in the training zone BEFORE you play them in a ranked match. My personal favorite is probably the Assassin, despite how hard she is to play (i.e. bouncing off the walls to end up backstabbing someone.) Overall, tons of triggerhappy fun, free TF2 items, and humor that'll keep you laughing while on the edge of your seat. This is so much more fun with friends too! (Skype calls, you never fail to amuse me.)			"

												Matchmaking is dead.Community veterans is only way,but they are agressive.And was not fixed for 1+years...Again,this game is also imbalanced thanks to no updates and such.It was good,but from now its a dead trash.You still have *hope* to it? No,for now. The devs currently working for insanely hard Planetary Annihilation(which is unbalanced). Well,how about balance your updates?So,positive reviews forced you to dislike mine? Well,how about counter to that...The game imbalances are coming...First,this game has an abuse with...Massive air. Yes abused. It gives a speed boost if you bunny hop,and well,it wansn't fixed snice then. Another disbalance is cheesing. Snice a player can keep damaging a tower to pervent backing its shields up(in crossfire)or just destroying it by staying out of its range and shooting it,this makes another *hole* in gameplay.Second,this game has a different network,which makes players who has a higher ping to shoot MUCH less accurately as ping increases. Those who have a low ping have an upper hand in accuracy.Third,a good team will always have an assault,because of his quick recharging jetpack(which is OP),grenade lanucher(also OP)and has no aiming penlaty while doing it.Oh yes,keep saying its good,actually its IMBALANCED. For now. Till the devs will listen to us.Still downvoting? Scroll down through negative reviews,and you find old ones,that explain everything bad about this game.			"

												Super MNC is the most F@#%!*& SUPER CRAZY AWESOME 3rd PERSON SHOOTER MOBA OF ALL HISTORY OF CRAZY MOBA'S IS JUST PERFECT AND..... DEAD!In my opinion, is the best moba game of all history, SMNC contains everything, or almost everything you can imagine, explosions, robots, weapons, a gorilla, lady with guns and much more. No need spend real money to get good itens, of course if you pay you get itens more fast (and buy outfits only can be puchased with real money), but if you play a day or two, maybe three you can buy a new character or new gear to up your abilitys. unfortunately the game need players, much much players, you need wait a long time to enter or create a game with full teamsPros:-Amazing-Simple-Very very very funny-Guns-Beautiful girls with guns-Explosions-Crazy gameplay-AmazingAgainst:-Missing players-I was another topic, but I forget it			"

												A fast-paced third-perdon shooter. It's really fun. All game modes really focus on one central thing (which isn't bad.). Escorting robots to the enemy team's ""moneyball"" , whih is guarded by rocket turrents, and destroying it all, while defending your own. You pick a ""pro"" to fight as. They each have their own skills and pros and cons. You can upgrade your skills, as well as your offensive (more damage, etc.) and defensive (more speed, etc.) (for the match being) in the heat of battle. There's a mascot that contantly runs around dropping money (which can be used to buy powerups in battle) and health items, and juice. Get enough juice, you become overpowered for a short time.    Another reason to get this game is you can get two hats for Team Fortress 2.  Bad thing is the game is dead. The devs no longer update it or anything. But should you really care? No. Play it. It's worth while.			"

-note-outside blitz mode its best to ask in chat for a invite.A fps that plays like dota2. The main game consists of pushing lanes and taking out ""towers"" to get the the opponents money ball.You start each match at level 1 and can level upto 15 and on each level you can upgrade 1 of your 4 powers.As you play you will get money for bot & player kills.You use this money to activate turrets, jump pads, spawn bots, power-ups, Shelly (fires rockets in one side of the level damaging opponents) and a annihilator that will kill all the opposing teams bots.There is also a blitz mode where you try to defend a money ball through as many bot waves as you can.The game has many characters or pros for different play styles and it helps game play if teams don't have to many of the same kind of pro on a team.Sadly most that can get a game now just play blitz mode because of the rampant exploiting in the other modes.Another problem is the levels anyone starting fresh will get matched with high level players (do to low population) and they normally just beat the crap out of you wile trolling and calling you names.The game is no longer updated and there is even a glitch for opening an infinite about of treasure balls.it's a fun game but its in a sad place do to neglect.

In the old MNC you could place turrets now you can't is just like in Dota2 , League of Legends , etc. once a turret is destroyed is destroyed for good .The game has it's own bad things , you hardly farm credits for the stuff you want .... and that sux , but this new MNC has plenty of new champions which i like . My favourite still remains the asssasin , i don't know to play something else and i don't wanna learn ;D If i recommend it  ? Yes , I really do , and you know why ? Because despite the things i hate from Super MNC this game has great potential and I cannot deny that . Ofcourse the matchmaking still sux but the game itself is wonderful , So let's play :D			"

												Honestly would have been a great game if UberEnt didn't abandon it without warning.  This was the third-person DotA-esque experience before SMITE came out, the team shooter with unique hero abilities and shiz back when Overwatch was still just that super vague Project Titan.   Had a pathetically bad F2P setup though which is what really shot it in the foot.  Gameplay-wise none of the team-based/MOBA-ish shooters to come out so far have really tried to capture what SMNC and its predecessor (Monday Night Combat) did.   Really was a gem.  Too bad it was left to rot in maintenance mode when it could have been a huge name if it had a more competent team running its monetization model.			"

												This game right here. Had a lot of potential. A botched launch and lack of new characters hindered the already tiny player base. Those that were left were hardcore into the game and there wasn't enough players for MM to make good matches. So the new players get stomped, say ♥♥♥♥ this, and uninstall. Game is so dead but god damn was it fun there was active players.			"

												Tbh I enjoyed playing this game when it first came out, but couldn't play it much becuase it was too laggy. When I finally got a better PC I reinstalled it, but the game had already died out so I stopped again. Then I started playing again to get the TF2 items but it was difficult with the lack of players which resulted in long queues to even play. I wouldn't recommend downloading the game becuase there are no players to play it, but I'm not giving it a bad review/recommendation cause the game was actually a lot of fun when you did get to play it.

												This is a great game and I'm having loads of fun playing it. Yes, the community isn't so big anymore, but if you actually try you will always find someone to play with. Personally, I play almost exclusively the game mode ""Super Blitz"" where you and a team of up to 4 more players fight off waves of bots to defend your Money Ball. Around 90% of the time I manage to get a full 5 person team together. That isn't too bad if you ask me.The Pros (characters) are fun and unique and each game a new adventure.			"

												Dead? No. No supported with updates? Yes. Bad? No.Super MNC is a Dota x TF2. A very enjoyable game that will give you a vast ammount of time of fun. Each class has personality that will always be entertaining (well until it just gets annoying).It can be hard to get a lobby or game going at some parts of the day since the game is more barren than it used to be. The only things that keep this game alive are people that still enjoy the game at base and people like me that went to get TF2 hats which I still didn't get the final peice after 11 hours.It is free and you can get hats for TF2 so I recommend it and I know that some of you people that have 100s of hours in this game hate me for it but deal with. The devs don't update the game with content and you can get free hats for a more popular game. I'm sorry.			"

												Unique looking and excelent graphics, unbalanced and not newbie-friendly gameplay.Some characters are overpowered.Complicated upgrade system (products, endorcements etc), complicated menu, NO kick voting in case a hacker joins the game or someone is abusing a glitch.All followed by an un-friendly community (Some players were reported multiple times but nothing happened, bullying problems ) and a very close community (Few people are online), sometimes servers are down.From my experience what I enjoyed the most are the graphics and the unique interaction between the player and the 3rd person shooter as well as the great animations.I would reccomend the game this game to someone who is characterised as ""Gaming Pro"" but definitely not to someone who has the same experience as I have ( low ).I really regret spending money on this game to buy new characters.Uber, on their try to make a new game with fancy graphics forgot that the gameplay matters as well.And not only that but they try to make people forget that this game is a rival of Monday Night Combat, by removing support ( But you still have to pay Monday Night Combat to play!""What I see is a company with great graphic skills to try desperately to make a new game to attract players.

												If you're looking for something a bit out of the ordinary then you might want to check out Super Monday Night Combat, it's a MOBA game mixed with a 3rd person shooter and it works surprisingly well.The game looks good, has a great sense of humor, and the controls are responsive and easy to learn. The gameplay mainly centers around killing bots on a lane to escort your bots to turrets and eventually the opposite team's moneyball. Fairly straightforward, but it takes a few rounds to learn how things work. A lot of playable characters so there's sure to be someone who fits your playstyle, and they're adding more all the time.If you feel like trying something new, this is for you. Just be sure to play with some friends.			"

												Super MNC is an TD like game with FPS elements and RPG. Maybe you can it also describe as a Moba. The aim is to destroy all robots of the other teams. For that you can built-up turret and uplevel them. Your character is important, too. You can choose Assassin, Supporters, Strikers or Assault. Many things in this game are fancy like gorillas as chars or to kill a chicken or the juicy boy. Guess that should be funny.But for Newbies it's a lot of distraction from the main game concept. The easiest mode is Blitz with 5 players destroying waves of robots. After round 20 it's getting nasty. Here can only the Pros survive. You'll gain a lot of XP here.The other mode is Crossstrike where 1vs1 to max 5vs5 can play. you have to check everytime the map and support your robot armys on their way to the other team's core. That makes fun.But for some reason you will get in this mode only about 10% XP of Blitz mode.That wouldn't be neccessary to explain, if you don't need the XP to equip you char with better endorsements. And though the game is F2P you can buy XP for real money 6500XP = $3. The prices are annoying. For a complete outfit you can pay $15. You should test it once and try to reach all achievements. In Daytime there are only 40 players inside ...			"

												I'd recommend this game firstly because of it's originality. The Moba-Shooter mix, the nice colors and graphics, the either fast or slower paced gameplay depending on which gamemode you choose, and also the backstory and characters background / personalities makes it a very unique and awesome game.However the player base is thin, and most importantly the learing curve is steep, which has and will make new players quit and never look back on the game.But i can assure you, once you get past the hard times and get to know how the game works and which pro does what, this game will bring you some of the best hours, the best adrenaline rushes (especially when you close in for a kill) of your gaming career.

												I guess I'll post a short piece: It's a MOBA done as a 3rd person shooter with a bit of character customization. The style of it is done as a futuristic televised arena. There's a vid on the store page that explains the gameplay, so I won't really get into the details here. I'm going to recommend the game because it is fun  - B U T - The game has lost a lot of momentum being 3 years old and getting players to stick around is going to be difficult. If they did, maybe it would draw more players in. Maybe. But then most people don't want to put that kind of effort into it when their game itch could be sated elsewhere. I'm only guessing that a lot of the recent negative reviews are sour because there's a lack of player base and having a healthy player base is really important for a game like this.  "

												I played it to the point where I got the TF2 hats.  Didn't understand a thing.  After pouring time into Dota 2 and LoL, it makes a lot more sense.Certainly not bad, its a MOBA with third person shooter centric gameplay.  Even without knowing the basics of the MOBA genre, it was fun because ""shoot the other color"" is a pretty basic combat to grasp.  I'm pretty sure my teammates were raging at me because all I was doing was firing whatever explosive weapon I had at the bots and jumping around like an idiot, but every once in a while I got a kill or pressed that big middle button that made bots explode.  Even without understanding the in depth mechanics of the game, you can have fun if you can actually find a match.  My main issue is that there are a limited number of characters and it does the League thing of making only a select few available for free.			"

												The Monday Night Combat series consists of two 3rd person mobas.If you need a refresher on what a 3rd person moba is, then go take a look at Smite.Smite is directly competing against other, big name mobas such as DOTA2 and League of Legends.What makes it special is the third person perspective.Super MNC brings a LOT to the moba table, but at the same time, leaves you with so little...While other mobas are all stuck in a self-perpetuating cyclone centering around the high fantasy artstyle, Monday Night Combat is sports themed. Thats right, kids. Sports. They even have commentators and sponsorshipsThe world of MNC is robust with many sound assets and nice, shiny icons. However, after a week or so of playing, its easy for any gamer to distinguish a clear lack of content.The ""Pros"" (otherwise known as ""Heroes"" or ""Champions"" in other mobas) all have their own unique abilities, weapons and roles making teamplay a very interesting and engaging experience. Fighting 5v5 alongside an army of lesser warriors to achieve a common, territorrial goal. Just like any other moba.The big difference that you will see after prolonged play in Super MNC, is the clear lack of pros. Big name mobas will release new characters once a month, on average. These competitors also sport enormous rosters, all tweaked for balance. Though I will argue MNC is balanced to some degree, there is no customization outside picking from a pool of limited characters. The downfall of this game is a clear lack of community involvement in light of the limited roster.Uber went into this with the best intentions, and for a while it was good. However, the moba genre takes an incredible amount of maintenance to keep things fresh. Especially in a market so competitive.If you liked this game, or want to see what a 3rd person moba can do, check out Smite. Otherwise hope on DOTA2.This game will always hold a special place in my heart. I bought the original, I played with friends. I made new friends. I laughed at many of the voices, and many of the gags in this game will always bring back warm feelings. The sad fact of the matter is that mobas cannot stand the test of time. When we look at it, every multiplayer game will eventually reach its demise.Farewell.			"

												Pros:- Brilliant concept. The game presents itself as a future sport like The Running Man or Rollerball, leaning heavily towards the aesthetic of Smash TV.- Beautiful game in every way. A bit light on art assets, but what's there is gorgeous to look at and listen to.- Compelling Gameplay. The 3PS/DotA mix works much better here than the original Monday Night Combat. Metagame and strategy are equally important to shooter skills and teamwork.Balance: (not really a pro or a con)- The game is ""fun"". It's not really set up for competitive play. There are lots of random elements, such as bacon drops. Damage is slightly randomized. For most things this can be forgiven, but when your Jackbots can spit Bacon right into the enemy base, things get extremely crazy.- The cash shop. This is why the game is free to play, and also why the game never made money. The ecomony, while robust on paper, is infinitely exploitable via Steam Trading. The game needs to retain players to sustain the cash flow and - for the reasons listed below - that never happened.- Super Blitz mode is a decent way to farm Combat Credits and work on your PvE skills, but it will MELT YOUR FACE. It's impossible to win by design. The ""goal"" is to keep your Moneyball alive for as many waves as you can. You will fail eventually. You can buy tokens to repair your Moneyball and turrets during the round, but that's sort of cheating.Cons:- Matchmaking is completely broken. There is no ""ranked queue"". Everybody above level 20 gets thrown into one gigantic free-for-all and it sucks for new players. Newbs don't have flexible product loadouts or any endorsements (runes) worth mentioning. Combined with being generally unskilled at either the shooter or DotA elements or (god help you) both, newbs consistently get rekt every game until they can scrape together a decent understanding of the game mechanics and unlock most of the pros and products.- The Practice Game mode doesn't work. At all.- The tutorial is terrible, to the point of being arguably non-existent. The Training Camp is essentially a museum that showcases the various gameplay-related objects and lets you practice interacting with them to an extent. The ability to practice against Jackbots and Chickey Cantor in nice, but there isn't any particularly useful information to be found here, apart from what everything looks like and what each thing supposedly does.What I would suggest after touring the Training Camp is running a few solo Custom Games so you can at least figure out how lane bots spawn and why killing them is important. Then close SMNC and watch a few gameplay videos. Perhaps uninstall entirely. Your call, really.Turbocross is the only mode with decent queue times at the moment, and that's due to the drop-in/drop-out nature of the mode. Turbocross is rebalanced to play like old MNC, minimizing the importance of the DotA elements. If you're REALLY DESPERATE for Overwatch, you might enjoy killing time here.			"

												This game could have been great but it has too many flaws to keep me interested after I win the second of two Team Fortress 2 promotional items. The tutorial isn’t even remotely helpful, the learning curve is insane, and there’s no way to learn how to play the Pros (the playable characters) without having to play with other people, who are almost always far more experienced than you. Matchmaking is the only real way of playing, but the problem with it is that you are pretty much guaranteed to wind up against people far out of your league and paired with new players who are just as confused as you are. You should learn to play with friends. That way, you won’t have to worry about people with freakish experience and you can help each other win the hats for TF2.			"

												Would be a good game if there were actually playersThere is no good tutorial or explanation on what is going on. It may seem very simple but the game is fairly complex with its MOBA Elements.Sadly the progressing in this game is very slow and especially if youre new you will be matched with players that have hundreds of hours of experience compared to you, since only the old experienced players are still seen here. Due to the lack of players only 1 Gamemode is ""playable"", you won't find a gamelobby/players when searching for any of the other ones, which is sad because this game had so much potential.Basically its a ghosttown, since the last update was 2013.

												Super Monday Night Combat is a 3rd person MOBA game that the developers stopped caring about, and everyone else also stopped caring about.I had the game way, way back, and I liked it a lot. It was comedic, interesting (I had no idea what a MOBA was at the time) and just fun. Then it died. Nobody plays anymore, hitting about 150 at peak play times. Try dividing those into 3 different game modes. The classes (Or ""Pros"", as they're called in-game) are varied to a degree, enough to make them different, while fitting into the same basic archetypes. They were pretty interesting as characters aswell, such as a Superhero, a stereotypical gamer, a gorilla in a tux, Leonardo Da Vinci's clone, things of that sort. They used to switch every week, letting you play as 9 of the 18 or so classes, and you were able to buy the ones you liked enough to keep playing as with real money. The current pros haven't changed in at least 6 months because Uber doesn't care about the game anymore. There's customization abound, with each Pro having a good 9 or so weapons, and enough costumes to keep you looking different from the rest, if you're willing to spend the large amounts of money to buy them. This game was very, very Pay to Win, no weaponry aside from the standards could be used for free, but you could enjoy yourself none-the-less when you were losing. The camera was a little wonky and the gunplay wasn't the best, but it was a good game when it came out.As said, I really, really liked my time with the game. So why am I giving it a Not Reccomend? Because nobody cares anymore, that's why. How do you play a multi-player only game with no community? How do you try every Pro when the Developers don't think about switching them anymore? How do you enjoy an unplayable game?You simply don't.			"

That bieng the case, Super monday night combat now has broken ingame chat from what i read, inaccessability to modes that require que's. and has not recieved any new content or updates for too long.The game's fans have been ignored, let down, and forgotton about, a game that had potential to soar with popularity, earn the developers bucket loads of bucks, and grant its fans hours upon hours of mindless and intense fun.

												Best third-person DOTA style game out there, in my opinion.  It is free, with a free hero rotation.  You pretty much only pay for cosmetics.It is very funny, with lots of wacky characters, odd moments, and homorous ""play-by-play"" commentary.  Overall, I love this games style.  But don't let its light-hearted presentation fool you, SMNC can be quite the challenging game.It is unfortunate that any further developement has seemed to seize.  Uber seems to have abandoned SMNC to work on their crowdfunded project, Planetary Annhialation.  Hopefully with that project nearing completion (or so I think it is) we will begin to see updates to the game soon.  As of this date (10-9-14) the last update to SMNC was released on March 18th, 2013 (well over a year ago).			"

Special note for TF2 players: Just get in, do the achievements to get the hats and get out.Do NOT buy this game nor its original and not free counterpart, Monday Night Combat.The developer, Uber Entertainment, has abandoned support for this game for more than a year; not officially, mind you, but dead silence on anything from the company on the MNC/SMNC front as they are concentrating support on another game of theirs.While this is a fun, balanced 3rd person MOBA, mixing Team Fortress 2 and DOTA, as well as being one of the few games that is not only ACTUALLY hilarious, unlike other games where the jokes are funny once and never again, this has such an extensive library of well-written lines, it is sad that the developer decided to sabotage the game for a quick buck via the F2P & in-game store model.

The eye-opener for everyone:Okay guys, just let's be straigth now:This game has just has a lack of everything. The game itself is very onlogical, it doesn't look and feel familiar to as example TF2. It's a real pay to win game, if you have played this you really will know what pay to win means and never call a random game pay to win again. And what I just find very sad is that people spend lots of money to buy ingame goods and now the developers went this far that they have deleted everyone's inventory... Why? Its simple, they know that the game is dead. It is just a waste of time playing it guys, only a few people are playing this though, in a very boring gamemode. Don't think that you can download the game and later go play this. Almost all modes are dead and if you really want to play the one you like, the matchmaking servers will kill you because the download time of this game is just quicker than just playing a mode of the game. There is no real community. And everyone comes for the TF2 items. Listen up buddies, it's not worth it! Any idea how long it will take? Awkward controls, awkward third person, everything is just awkward in this game! So please guys don't play this nor get in touch with it, nor download it. Think about your children, your wife, the ones you care about! (This was just a little joke, don't take it very serious.) I also heard that the devs will maybe revive the game, or they are busy with another projects or maybe even a big one! If this is true, I will edit this review, but as how it's now I don't think this will happen... The last update of this game was in 2013 so yeah. Well, this was my review about this trashy game! I hope you enjoyed reading this!			"

There's alot of things to be said..Gameplay Pros:Well, I enjoy the MOBA/Tower Defense style it has to it. Lots of scenery & colorful things to look at, easy to spot enemies, numerous buttons to press to activate certain things that'll slightly support your team! Unique classes as well, and to be honest, there is ALOT of Team Fortress 2 in there. But hey, that doesn't matter here. The gameplay is honestly easy to manage, very smooth.During PVP, its easy to get caught up in a fight when you're in a lane. But as I said earlier, it is extremely easy to spot enemies, they stand out so much - Which isn't always a bad thing.Gameplay Cons:Major M1 Attack bug, I'm sure this is known as well. If you fire a full round and it auto-reloads, the next round you fire will be non-existant until you have at-least 5 bullets left in the chamber. No damage will be done during that time, and it even does the firing animations/muzzle flashes!Horribly unbalanced! And for all the long-time players out there, you better agree on this too; Endorsements are a thing in this game - Basically gives you anything you can imagine, Attack Speed, Reload Speed, Attack Damage, Jump Height, Reduced Damage Received, the list goes on. Meaning, if you barely started this game and you enter a PVP match against someone who has at-least 40 hours in, you will get shredded.Soundtrack:I do enjoy the soundtrack in this game, just like the old Monday Night Combat it kept the genre of Rock. Otherwise it wouldn't of made sense..Although there is some conga music there..Voice Acting:The voice acting is good, could use some work here and there but for the most part, it's good! I grew tired of hearing the Annoucer's voice though, he's so damn annoying. If you lose a damn match, he'll jump on you for it. ""OHOHOH, HAHA. I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER BECAUSE THESE GUYS..SUCK!""Conclusion:I played this game to Level 20 for a Team Fortress 2 hat, as much as I LOVE Monday Night Combat - Super Monday Night Combat was meh.6.5/10 "

												This game is amazing. If you've tried getting into games like DOTA and League of Legends and found that it's just not for you, this might tickle your fancy. It's hard, but it's easier to get into than Dota or League. It's also a shooter, not an RTS. I recommend watching TotalBiscuit's ""WTF is...

												SMNC is best described as a fusion between Moba (DoTA) and FPS (TF2) genre's. Choose a Hero, join a team of 5, push creep wave's into enemies base, win game. First and foremost - this game is difficult - it's a full of FPS and if you start doing badly, by not killing enemy creeps etc, you will be lower level than enemy Hero's. And then they will eat your face. It's a game very high on teamwork. It's a game you have to sit down and give a while to learn, before it starts rewarding you with joyous victory. Stylistically, this game is one of the most lushest, comedic experiences I have come across, F2P or not. Each character is voiced differently, and the commentators who run throughout the game are both Awesome and incredibly varied. As a F2P game it should be noted that only vanity items cost any money, so feel free to give the game a go, if you feel that this is a genre you could enjoy. Highly, Highly recomended.			"

												It's good if you like internet argument simulator, homophobic slurs, whiny entitled children who think they are cool for using gay as an insult and eat their own faeces.Gameplay is average but a bit unbalanced, the population is very low and only one game mode is active, the others being dead from abandoning players, made a very similar copy to TF2's mann co store, such as treasure balls being the SMNC mann co crates.The game's developers seem to have largely started to ignore this game, hasn't been updated in a long time now and a few bugs are persistant in the game.Credits come along slowly, which might be good except everything costs so much, so it takes weeks to get a product you want unless you constantly win.It only has a few maps meaning the variety is little and it becomes stale quickly. Very unwelcoming to new players as training does not prepare you for an actual game in any way.Community is hostile and throws homophobic slurs, hate against the disabled and whine to an excessive amount. Even if you're doing good, you will still get harrassed in the game.Report does nothing as there is no one managing the community any longer except maybe the forums. All in all, it is mediocre. Gameplay is average but the community is the worst you can get. But if you like aggrevating the overly sensitive and hostile players, this game is for you.			"

The many classes include Assult, the all around class, Assasin, the fast class, Supporter, your TF2 Medic and Engineeer all in 1 class, and much more! Gamemodes include Crossfire, where you try to destroy the enemys moneyball, or Blitz, where you defend your moneyball against a horde of robots! This game is by far, a one of a kind fun shooter.

												Don't play this game, just don't. If you expected anything than force donate, moba non-balanced game, with a lot of features you have to find out by yourself and about which game doesn't tell you anything than it's not for you. Just playing it to get the TF2 hats. Consider that this game is extremely non-friendly to new players and you will suck. A lot. Buy gunslinger or sniper and dominate the ♥♥♥♥ out of opposing team. Yup, some classes are just too OP. Also almost noone is playin this game so good luck finding a playable server. TIP: play on North America, EU and  Australia are completily non-playable. But the matches are pretty short, max 10-15 min and full of action. Also donate is pretty cheap. But still i won't recommend it. Unless you want 2 hats for TF 2. GL and HF.			"

												I actually liked Super MNC for a time, heck I played the original MNC on the Xbox 360. But for some reason, I kinda got bored of it and didn't feel like going back to it ever again. The idea was original (at least to my knowledge), becoming a world-wide sporting league of the future. The Characters were unique and were fun to play, and the arenas each had their own unique spin and had showed different ways to outmaneuvering, and outsmarting your opponents with Traps, Turrets, and Bots. The game was fun for a while, but it never really stuck to me, as probably what happened to most people. This is just my personal opinion and experience of the game.			"

												This game deserves another chance at life. Even after playing for my first few hours, I could tell it was a great game. It's in no way ""pay-to-win"", fairly simple to learn, and crazy-fun when you have a full team to play with and against. In addition to competitive, there's also a cooperative game mode to change things up. I would recommend this game to people who enjoy Team Fortress 2, DOTA, League of Legends and anyone who enjoys a strategic third-person shooter. Let's revive this gem.			"

The game is very good and the idea is original, but the developers dont update it anymore. It's player base is too low and the game has tons of unfixed bugs, crashes and old stuff. Don't waste time or money with it.It's easy to learn, fun and very hard to find a game due to the player base being next to non-existent in the player department. The game developers have also neglected the game completely, giving up on updates and any further content. This also means they have left only a few server, forcing you into creating a lobby and waiting 30 mins for someone to join.It's free, it's DEAD and it's a good game to play for an hour or two, by yourself or with friends.

Although the game is dead (due to bugs and no desire from the development team to continue working on this - no new content etc) it's a great game, different perspective on the world of mobas.Good ideas not enough development.

												This game deserves a lot more attention with chaotic PVP matches, robot wave survival, and a few other game modes. this game has become a favorite of mine but it may require some money here and there but it'll be worth it just like any other F2P game- pay-to-win or master your skills and earn the rewards through skill and hard work			"

												- THIS GAME IS NOT UPDATED BY THE DEVELOPERS ANYMORE! - I have over 400 hours playing this, so read it to the end. The game is very good and the idea is original, but the developers dont update it anymore. It's player base is too low and the game has tons of unfixed bugs, crashes and old stuff. Don't waste time or money with it.It's easy to learn, fun and very hard to find a game due to the player base being next to non-existent in the player department. The game developers have also neglected the game completely, giving up on updates and any further content. This also means they have left only a few server, forcing you into creating a lobby and waiting 30 mins for someone to join.It's free, it's DEAD and it's a good game to play for an hour or two, by yourself or with friends. Give it a go, but don't expect anything in the long term.			"

												It's a great game, one of my favorites of all time. But in its current state? Nearly impossible to find a game.I wish they'd just release their assets to help keep the game alive. Like, let us form our own servers and stuff, you know?Matchmaking doesn't work if enough people aren't actively playing, and since new players can't find games fast enough, they just end up quitting. imo, matchmaking gave this game a really bad rap.Uber, if you're reading this, don't underestimate how many of us truly loved this game, and would gladly keep it alive if you helped make it possible.

												Super MNC provides a fun, free, and interesting game to fans of shooters or ARTS games. Being a sequel to Monday Night Combat, this free to play third person ARTS game adds more influence from Dota along with evolution in style and feel. Each character, or pro, plays similarly to some others but have unique weapons and abilities to them. The art style is eclectic, ranging from the outdoors or urban environments of each arena to the differing styles of each pro. Like MNC, gameplay is a mix between TF2 and Dota, with more Dota style to the game. However, a new mode brings back the faster pace from the original MNC. In vein to games like LoL and Dota 2, weekly updates change pro rotation and add new features while a store offers cosmetics or pros for a fairly high price. SMNC is a unique kind of free to play multiplayer open to all the masses with strong developer support.			"

												For a rather small player base, it is still a regularly fun game to play for an hour or so. Though the only mdoe I have played is Super Blitz since I didn't find an interest in Team Deathmatch modes for this particular game.This game however does not get enough credit with it's corny lines and fast-paced action. Though I can only vouch for it's Super Blitz mode. Which pits 5 players of various player-chosen classes against hordes of robots while the announcer of Super MNC yells and cusses you out. So far I have only reached round 47, but the action is still incredibly fast and packed with bullets and explosives. A very fun play once in a while, otherwise it's very repetitive. Class customization allows you to boost your character how you want to, but not without it's side effects in the case of 'Endorsements'.I would say that if you have an interest in Team Fortress 2 or Gotham City Imposters, you should give this game a try as it's also Free-to-Play.

												If you guys on steam honestly want my opinion this really does have to be THE worst game ive played ever! Not only is it confusing at first what to do when I was in training mode i didnt even get to kill any npcs at the same level i was at. Just a bunch of stupid 1 shot kill robots. When I actaully was put in a server at level 1 I tried numourus times to kill at least ONE person  but I couldnt. There is no rank server you just are thrown into a server of random ranked people who could be Level 36 and you're just level 1 and have no idea what the heck you're doing. The classes I could not tell the difference apart they all looked the same.  The game for me was just a horrible experience. My score is 1/10			"

												Barely playable MOBA. The matchmaking mixes players regardless of their level, resulting in unbalanced matches. The game only gives you 6 characters to choose from, the rest of them is locked behind a paywall (You want to purchase this guy? 7000 gold. Good luck. You only get like 50 for a won match). Needless to say, premium characters are way stronger than basic ones. The netcode is terrible as well. Often grappling your opponent doesn't register and the game tends to jitter because of lag.The game is REALLY slow paced. Everyone does a low amount of damage and has a lot of health, including bots/turrets. As a result, the rounds tend to drag on forever.The nail to the coffin for that game is its terrible community. If you ask for advice, you're bound to be patronized and insulted by elitist players. SMNC is a waste of time. The only reason you'd want to play this atrocity is because of 2 free TF2 hats earned by completing achievements.			"

												As many past reviewers have said, if you are looking for an active multiplayer experience this game is not for you, as the player pase consits of less than 10 average players. HOWEVER, if you can get a bunch of friends together, you can still play this game and as a F2P title, I guess this could workout.However, if you are like me, and have a lack of friends, this game can still be fun if you like wave like defence games, with a slight tower defence element (more like money ball defence.)There are 3 main modes: Turbo Cross (dead) Crossfire (dead) and Blitz (sorta dead but you can solo play this at least.) As I stated above, I have no had the chance to play the crossfire & turbocross modes much as they player base is minimal, however I have played 1 game of Turbo Cross, and as a noob I will try to review these game modes. Turbo Cross consists of a very moba/dota 2 style of play, with PVP elements. Waves of bots (vreeps) spawn and push certain lanes towards the enemys money ball. You as a player have to push with your bots, destry enemy bots, and assist your bots in taking down enemy turrets. The team wins by destroying the oppositions Money Ball. Blitz takes the bots and pits them in increasingly difficult waves against you, where you/ your team must defend your money ball for as long as you can. Pretty much all my playtime on SMNC and MNC are from Blitz mode, as I really do personally enjoy wave like survival games, and the tower defence elements are so small and simplistic that I am not turned away from this. In conclusion, if you want a game to play with your mates, then I suggest picking this game up as it's F2P, however that is pretty much all this game can offer multiplayer wise at this stage unfortunately.

												This is definitely one of my all-time favorite games. Its a great blend of third person shooters, and MOBA style lane pushing. Part of what makes it so great is that it does not take itself seriously. Have you ever gotten a power up from eating bacon? From riding a giant chicken? From beating the living hell out of a green man with an inflated head and a baseball hat? You will now!The player base is small so occasionally its a little difficult to find a match to play, but on the bright side, being such a small base has lead to a pretty tight community. You'll meet the regular players pretty fast, and many of them will help you learn to play better if you ask. Enjoy the costumes while you're here. Sure you can be ole Captain Spark... Or you can be the badass Captain Romance, straight off your mom's private book collection, now featuring a huge inflatable duck, glowing eyes and a ticking pocket watch!Come for the fun, stay for the fun, 100/100.

												It's a great game, but it's dead now. Matchmaking is bad because of the lack of players. Actually, most of the problems are caused by a lack of players. In terms of gameplay, it can be a bit hard to get into. You either really love it or really hate it. Besides a few passive stat buffs, there is no item building or anything like that, so the character you pick is locked to a specific role. A role you have either have to play a lot or research a lot to play well.However, SMNC makes up for the lack of character variance with its gameplay variance. Giant chickens, lightning strikes, dangerous robots, all accompanied by the best announcers you will ever hear. You will never play a game like this anywhere else. Not for free. It can be annoying sometimes, but the good far outweighs the bad.			"

												A poorly crafted game that steals from gameplay from Dota 2 fps hybird and mostly relies on sex appeal and comedy to attract players, the game has no matchmaker and will chuck players baby new players with very little little of the player base that this game has you will often see the same players over and over and most of those times they will be people that spent money on the game and will have overpowered characters which they have professionalized at or much commonly using 100 different hacks and there is only 3 maps and can feel very limited. The average graphics and menus (for 2012) can sometimes make this game feel barley playable but most of the time you will feel bored with them and feel like something is lacking, the game itself past the one hour mark after or when you get used to the as stated before comedy and sex appeal becomes repetitious majorty of female characters are barley clothed and characters are not orginal and some will do bad impressions of actors.. The biggest advantages of this game is TF2 hats and its a F2P (crippled with micro transations)Only reason to play this game is for the tf2 hats, Which will take 5 hours  (with XP boosts) if you win regulary and 10~12 hours without xp boosts without xp boosts (if you regulary win) as soon as I got the hat I uninstalled this game from the my computer, only play this game if you want the tf2 hats			"

												This is game is mostly dead, just to let any of you who might be interested in it-know. Uber hasn't updated SMNC in about 3 years.If you are interested in obtaining the Flamingo Kid and the Triclops hats in TF2, it takes approximately 224 afk games of Custom Blitz (a mode which you can play by yourself.) Just leave your computer open and start a new match every few minutes or so, and you'll be able to get them fairly quickly.Oh, and the game itself it a mess. There are too many conflicting art styles with the characters and game; even the main menu music can range anywhere from smooth jazz to hard metal rock. Animations are very choppy and get stale after a while. I can't really comment on the gameplay (as I only played a very few matches with actual people,) but I can say that grapple spam is very prominent, and basically lets you stun-lock your foes to death if you time it right.3/10 Overall. So much potential, it's a shame the developers let the game go so easily. Would only recommend this game for the free hats.			"

												Anti-recommendation.This game is completely inaccessable for new players in any way, shape or form. The player base is primarily composed of hardcore players that spent hundreds of thousands of hours playing Monday Night Combat, as well as people that spend too much time playing MOBAs as well.Essentially you have a toxic envoirment for any new players; no one will ""teach"" you how to play and expect you to know how everything works from the get-go. The mechanics and even the controls aren't explained to you - I had to be told at least THREE DEGREES from friends that knew how to play that there was even a button to assign skill points!Just as well, there is no tutorial system whatsoever, there isn't a balance between setting players up that have barely started playing versus those who have hundreds of games under their belts, and all in all they seek to make the game less fun for newbies like me.If this gets out of beta safely it will be a marvel.

												NOTE: Game currently has little players and some of them are just cheating... Who ♥♥♥♥ing cheats in an almost dead game? Jeez, some people... Get a life.Best MOBA ever. The objective of the game is to push your bots (minions) to the opposing team's base center (called ""moneyball""), by destroying their defensive turrets (note that only bots can remove the turrets' shield). Only the bots can bring down the moneyball so you can shoot it. Killing the opposing players is good, but keep in mind it is not the objective of the game. I've seen teams with a lot of kills lose the game because they forgot to push their bots. This is not CoD ;)This game is so fun and underrrated I could cry. Since I discovered it I cannot stop playing it. It has a good dose of humour, gameplay is very good, player base is hilarious (don't take anyone too seriously), balanced matches are very intense. Game relies a lot on teamplay, although very good players can tip the balance. Sadly too few players, but usually you can find turbocross matches, although these matches can be a little too harsh for newbies sometimes, as usual players are already somewhat experienced.Some bugs appear from time to time, but nothing really annoying. Cheaters sometimes appear to ruin the match. These sad little kids with no life or skill have nothing better to do than cheat in an almost dead game. They think they're so 1337 because they can cheat. My main strategy in these cases is just leaving the match, not worth your anger. But don't confuse good players with cheaters ;)Shame on Ubersoft for not caring about this game anymore. PS: if you're new please don't pick assassin, it's not a good class for beginners. Good players ♥♥♥♥♥♥ you with assassin doesn't mean you can play her as well as they do. And btw cloaking is NOT invisibility.			"

												I was super into SMNC back in late 2012-really early 2013. It was a fun game, if one that was flawed as hell. Unfortunately, the game just never found its footing, only breaking 1K concurrent players in the first month of its life, dwindling to only a couple hundred after just a few months, and was ultimately abandoned by its creator less than a year into its life due to a lack of interest.Is there much sense in writing a review for a multiplayer-only game that hasn't had more than 100 concurrent players in three years? Probably not, but screw it. I consider this some sort of closure.I mentioned earlier that the game was heavily flawed, and it was. There were a lot of bugs, matchmaking took forever even during its glory days, the game's balance was never quite right, the amount of grinding to unlock new characters without paying an obscene amount of real world money was ridiculous, and in retrospect it shouldn't have been surprising that the game tanked as quickly as it did, even with one of the biggest cross-promotions with TF2 at the time.So then, what kept me hooked for months?It was fun, in a broken sort of way. The blend of decent third-person shooting and MOBA elements was pretty unique at the time. The production values were pretty stellar for an indie game, with a nice TF2-style art style, funny dialogue, and some wonderful Borderlands-esque black humour/satire. The two main modes were addictive, and matches rarely outstayed their welcome unless you were getting stomped into the dirt.It's funny, actually. In many ways SMNC's ultimate failure feels a lot like what would happen to Battleborn four years later. A decent game that just never took root and died young. It's a sad thing when an IP with such promise never blossoms, and after the horrific commerical failure of SMNC I can't imagine we'll see Monday Night Combat resurface ever again. But I hope it does, someday.			"

												One of my favorite free to play titles!Do you enjoy class based shooters like Team Fortress 2 or Tribes Ascend? Do you enjoy MOBAs such as DOTA 2 or Smite etc? If you you said yes to either or both of those questions you owe it to yourself to give this game a shot. Right when you start they have an optional tutorial level where you can test out hero abilities, learn about the different AI controlled enemies (called creeps usually, bots in this case), and get a feel for the environmental weapons and events to help ease you into this hybrid style of game. Naturally a veteran of any of the previously mentioned games will want to skip over this, but you can leave the tutorial from the menu anytime so I recommend checking it out at least for the environment attacks.There is also a co-op horde mode which can be used for increased training before the real deal or as an alternative to regular matchmaking should you find high wait times* or have a more PvE minded team. It lacks the strategy of defending towers or spawning creeps, but is a good way to practice shooting, coordinating team abilities, or having absent minded fun. *Wait times are currently ridiculous in the 5v5 modes due to low player countSuper Crossfire is the name of the game's main entree. You only have two lanes and one jungle so team fights happen often and are never far away from you. One lane usually has 2 people and the other has 3, causing one of the lanes to be constantly pushed and therefore in need of defending. Alternatively you can have a fifth man roam between the lanes seeking the enemy roamer or hiding for surprise attacks. In the middle of all the fighting and pushing, events are constantly occurring in the jungle like a free money spawning ""enemy"", a Roshan like boss that gives a buff on defeat, a creep wiping laser and more. This gives the game a perpetual feeling of motion and speed never allowing boredom.There is another game mode which takes the premise of Super Crossfire and makes it more shooter-esque. Damage is increased, speed is increased, turret shields do NOT come back, health regen changes from DOTA-like to Halo-like, and other changes to creeps and players. This mode is great if you want a faster match or are less fond of the strategy layer.In Short:PROS+ Great Hero Variety+ Multiple Maps+ Multiple Modes+ Map Events+ Perfect Balance of Action and Strategy+ Excellent Humor with Top-Notch Voice Acting+ Amazing Art Style and GraphicsCONS- Long Matchmaking/No playerbase - game abandoned by devs. (The developers would like to revive it though)- What's left of the players are the most toxic of the community- No new content planned (heroes, maps, etc.) again due to abandonment- Matchmaking isn't separated by skill so new players can get destroyed by long time playersIf you can get 4 friends to try it with you a great game is waiting to be discovered even if you stick to the horde mode. If you can find 9 friends you've eliminated virtually all of the cons to this game.9.5/10			"

												Terribly optimised game. Never connects to ""team server"", cannot form any kind of game - including offline matches.When you can get in a match, the rules are terribly explained and ""pro"" classes automatically win. You are juggled around everywhere because of faulty servers and the UI is appalling.Just play TF2 instead.			"

												There's a reason I only played ten hours. Most people that I knew got turned off after one and a half. Broken matchmaking systems, the lack of dev support, waiting for literally up to ONE AND A HALF HOURS or so for either L0Z0rThaP3ngu1nofDOOM, xXxDeath_MasterxXx, or juan.santos2005 to join in, the fact that the top guide nowadays is made specifically to get people in and out as fast as possible, and the fact that the majority of the 40 people still playing this game have turned into a toxic mess rivaling low tier competitive LoL or DOTA just makes it a awful game to be on. The hat's you get from this game for TF2 look bad, and the cosmetics you get in this game are overpriced to oblivion AND look bad. If the Mann Co. Store from TF2 and EA's cosmetic DLC system had a baby, it would be the Uber store, which currently in a eternal sale because of how little it's been used. If you like old memes and wasting cash, look no further.Along with ugly costumes, it has honestly one of the worst class buying systems out there. Heroes of the Storm got nothing on this. Basic characters, like stronger tanks or longer range characters, have to be unlocked with hard earned THOUSANDS of coins (The TANK class, for example, needs 4500 coins). You only get like 40 coins per win/loss. This is a problem, and often leads to new players get destroyed by older, richer, and more class unlocked players.	On the bright side of this mess, the combat's in SMNC is alright. With the 5 classes you get unlocked, out of the game's unlockable 17, being fun to use when you finally do good (rarely), and offer different playstyles which spices up the game a bit. Blitz is pretty cool as well, a Tower Defense sort of deal against the robots that gives lots of XP on completion. Use this if your grinding for that last TF2 hat, you're going to need that last boost after spending time during the dead hours of the game.In short, with a tiny community practically rivaling DOTA/LoL levels of toxicity, overpriced and ugly cosmetics and hero unlocks, ridiculous grinding for ugly rewards, and a horrendous amount of waiting, even for a dead game, the combat and game modes can't save this from not getting a recommendation.

Name: Super Monday Night CombatVariations: Super MNCDeveloper: Uber EntertainmentDate: 2012Relationships: Sequel To ""Monday Night Combat"" (2010)Genre: MOBA, TPSOrientation: MultiplayerPopulation: Few Who SurvivedPerspective: 3D - Third-PersonTimeflow: Match-Based, Real-TimeSkills: FingersSetting: FuturisticStyle: -Tags: Complicated, No Campaign, No Story, No Tutorial, Noob Unfriendly, RPG ElementsModel: F2PContent: MicrotransactionsPlatforms: PCReview: Futuristic TPS MOBA game with complicated rules and few game modes, including typical lanes-towers-nexus-5v5, defend-nexus-from-waves and something else I couldn't try. Why? Simply no players, miss Queue is just lost and doesn't know what is she supposed to do with these 10 people online. All games are created as custom games with no exceptions, and invitations are sent through chat.	There is no tutorial, just bulsh*t youtube video that says 3 words about each thing in the game, leaving you wondering about 80% things. That's how developers respect new players. Not even all controls are explained (and you can not change controls as far as I know - I played few training games and 1 multiplayer before someone finally explained me how to switch weapons, Jesus.	Rules are so complex that after watching this 7 minute video you still won't know anything. Go to Practice mode, and spend good 30 minutes running around the map clicking on green rays (about 20 of them if not more) - then tutorial voice will tell you information about different things in game. But still, even if you manage to remember all this sh*t, don't expect knowing everything about the game.	There are hero classes (heroes are called 'pros' here), minion types each with weaknesses and advantages, turret types, level ups and abilities (usable or toggle), different jungle mobs, super-powa self-buff, different vendor machines on map selling stats and buffs, purchasable jump pads, deploying minions, map objectives like 'annihilator' that destroys all enemies when used, items providing unique bonuses and more - I don't remember everything honestly.	Visually game looks nice - futuristic cityscape arenas in sport style, minions looking like droids of different shapes and sizes, and characters looking slightly close to Team Fortress 2 guys but less comic. And of course cosmetic things you can buy make it even more beautiful. But.. there is no point doing so. Game is so dead you can't even try it.	I never tried original B2P Monday Night Combat, but I'm afraid that if Super MNC is so dead than orinal is nothing but a ghost town...Class: III - Dead BreadVerdict: NoReviewed: 1.11.2016Approach: Steam - PCTime: An HourDeeds:  1 Multiplayer Match Played (Don't laugh great achievement in such conditions) "

												After playing monday night combat on xbox as one of their indie games i fell in love with this game. The characters and the concept of it were just perfect and i coudlnt wait till this F2p second coming was gonna be on steam.But, sadly it just didnt get the players it needed. People right outa beta just crub stompd the poo outa the newer players and i think i left people to not wanting to come back. Sadly you couldnt fix it though, at its peak it only had around 3-4k players i think? (maybe a lil more?). You cant exactly make skill based match making with so few people imo.Then they started adding different game modes which was the beginning of the end for this game. You cant add 2 diff game modes and expect it to not cripple your player base by taking a small community and then spreading it out even more.Finally the last straw for me was when they decided to just jump ship and start on PA, completely dogging anyone who put any money into this game (i didnt spend money but boy did they get plenty of my time). They said (UBER ENT) that they wouldnt just leave this game while working on PA, they could do both. Well 2 months after they said that they gave some swan song forum post about how all their resources need to be on PA and they will go back to super monday night combat when PA is in a good place. Now im pretty sure this games about dead with prolly like 100 people playing if youre lucky (maybe 2-300), they are liars, would love for them to prove me wrong, but why would they come back to a dieing game. I bought a computer JUST to play this game, thats how much i loved it. But UBER said FU community, we got your cash, off to the next ponzi scheme/half finished game with a premium shop. For this they get a big fat NO. Not because the games not fun, but because these goofs dont deserve a good review or anyone elses money. Anything theyve made is dead. Let that be your guide into wether or not you should consider planetary annialation.... UberEnt - money grabbin like its hot since 2008			"

												The only reason anyone in their right mind would play this game is because of the tf2 hats you get. I only played one game, and I think I'll die before I get the level 20 hat. Oh well. Basically, I have no fun playing it, and it takes 10 minutes to find a match. And when you are in game, you realize how lazy the developer is. The game looks like a bad copy of loadout. Or a Team Fortress 2 wannabe. When you are done with the game, it is one of the biggest reliefs you get in gaming as now you know you dont have to play this crap for the next minute. You get a prize with incredibly annoying music at the end of a round, and its usually something useless that you will never use. Not to mention, when I am looking through the people online, its the SAME 20 people from yesterday evening that was online. Oh, and don't even get me STARTED with the announcer. At first I thought he was the only good thing they did to this game, but later figured out I had to mute the announcers voice to prevent my ears from bleeding.Final Summary: Puts the UNREAL engine to shame with it's lazy developers and annoying announcements. 1/10 Would NEVER play again after getting the hats.

												Well done, Ubi - you took a great xbox 360 game and concept and ran it into the ground with DRM, mandatory registration and even requiring the practice mode to be online. The pay to play (and win concepts) are so transparently there, it's laughable. I'd recommend this as a skip - if you want a halfway decent moba / turret game, go with battleborn or dungeon defenders.			"

												I really hope this game dies. That sounds horrible but the game is so monotonous you do the same thing in 3 different ways over and over. It really bugs me that its a pay to win to. There are people who wasted $20 on this game and instantly kill you repeatedly. I mean at first its fun, then when you reach level 5 it gets a little boring, then at level 10 you understand why people dont play the game and respect it, then at level 15 you get really bored of the game, either quitting it or pushing through to get the stupid hat, and at level 20, where I am, YOU JUST HATE THE GAME AND WANT IT TO DIE AFTER IT GIVES YOU THE HAT THAT TURNS OUT TO BE WORTHLESS.

												Well. I went to download this game because it looked alright, but truth is, it is almost the worst game I have ever played. There are NO players, the game is put together more like a tf2 clone than a MOBA, and the tutorial is worse than not having on at all.This sums up my experience: Wait 15 minutes for a match, then someone is global chat FINALLY responds to me, telling me people ONLY PLAY TURBOCROSS. So I queued up, got into a game, and proceded to get rekt. I asked for some helpful hints, and all I got was someone calling me a noob. Duh, 1st game.Aside for the face that there are literally 6 people on at one point, they are very toxic. The fact that this game even has the audacity to ask for my money makes me extremely upset. I waited a half hour to download this, and played for an hour. This is time I will never get back.Take my word for it, this is a horrible game, and you will only waste your time. Get Dota/Smite/Lol/Strife/Heroes of the Storm instead.			"

												What happes when you take the original Monday Night Combat, make it free to play, and then update it for a year before abandoning it? This ♥♥♥♥ing thing. When it was active it was pretty solid and fun. Now, the servers hardly work, at one point you couldn't even log into the servers. If they ever take the time and attention to devleope this game, you bet your candy ♥♥♥ I'll play another 500 hours. But as of now, do not even consider playing.			"

												super monday night combat was a awsome looking game but when i got in omg it was hard. Well for one thing it took forever to find a match and some of the gamemodes are dead. When i finaly got into a match i began to play but after maybe 2 minutes they were telling me to get out i didnt respond back and the mechanics were a little diffrent from some games so i was confused for a bit. The gameplay was intresting for awhile then it got slowly degrading and boring. This game looks good no doubt about that but the lack of a community and veteran players hating noobies just draws away from the game. In a 1 to 10 score i give it a 4/10 the gameplay is not bad but a little confusing at first and second is the community being dead with whats left of it not completly willing to let new players in.

												Super MNC is great fun (despite some elements that can feel cheap or frustrating). The blend of shooter and MOBA feels fresh and unique, and combined with the over-the-top combat-sports world created by Uber, Super MNC is a blast to play. You may even be tempted to spend some money on it, given how awesome some of the costumes and taunts are (do yourself a favour and look up the Gunslinger's Judge Dredd uniform and Captain Spark's Action Hero taunt).Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2012/09/super-mnc.html "

The comical commentators were great to listen to while rolling around as the assassin, stabbing FACE! I love this game, absolutely love it.Unfortunately the game is dead. There are 603 people online at any given time. To be fair I rarely have a problem finding a game but there just isn't anyone on anymore. Also the interface is a bit confusing. It looks pretty bad but once you get used to it, it's easy to navigate. Overall I would recommend this game to people.Come back and play! This game needs a community!!^_^			"

												This is an extremely fun, simplistic 3rd person shooter MOBA. There's skills that you can upgrade upon leveling up, but no gear (weapons, armor, etc) to buy. There are power ups you can buy (bonus health, speed) (...and by buy, I mean buy with currency earned during the match.)  With the same currency you can also spawn creeps, rebuild destroyed towers, upgrade towers, activate traps, etc.However, the game is dead. Only a handful of people left playing, so good luck finding a match.			"

												I do NOT reccomend this game to anyone who wants a good Free-To-Play shooter. I got this game because it seemed nice and also for the Team Fortress 2 hats. It seemed ok at first, then I realized the game seems like a ghost town in a sense that it seems like not many people play this game, also it's major problem is that it's Pay-To-Win, I've played multiple times and those that payed for the virtual goods had a much bigger advantage than I did, also after every match you earn coins and XP. If your F2P then sorry you don't get too many coins. If you want a good F2P shooter that ISN'T P2W, Team fortress 2 or Planetside 2 are much more viable options.			"

The blend of shooter and MOBA feels fresh and unique, and combined with the over-the-top combat-sports world created by Uber, Super MNC is a blast to play. You may even be tempted to spend some money on it, given how awesome some of the costumes and taunts are (do yourself a favour and look up the Gunslinger's Judge Dredd uniform and Captain Spark's Action Hero taunt).Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2012/09/super-mnc.html "

												This is why in my opinion every game needs a singleplayer mode. Multiplayer experience is completely dependent on the amount of other online individuals who also play, so this game is basically bricked seeing as it has such a tiny community.

												Very Good. Its pushing to become its own game by using the ""Buy keys for crates for hats"" tactic, but it has so much potential. So long asit doesn't end up having fifty different HUDs, needed ""Purchase Only"" characters, or pushes for a eSports mode, since, you know, it's already influenced by sports enough.			"

												I do NOT reccomend this game to anyone who wants a good Free-To-Play shooter. I got this game because it seemed nice and also for the Team Fortress 2 hats. It seemed ok at first, then I realized the game seems like a ghost town in a sense that it seems like not many people play this game, also it's major problem is that it's Pay-To-Win, I've played multiple times and those that payed for the virtual goods had a much bigger advantage than I did, also after every match you earn coins and XP. If your F2P then sorry you don't get too many coins. If you want a good F2P shooter that ISN'T P2W, Team fortress 2 or Planetside 2 are much more viable options.			"

												I played this game when there was an actual community and it was so much fun. The gameplay was great, for me. The comical commentators were great to listen to while rolling around as the assassin, stabbing FACE! I love this game, absolutely love it.Unfortunately the game is dead. There are 603 people online at any given time. To be fair I rarely have a problem finding a game but there just isn't anyone on anymore. Also the interface is a bit confusing. It looks pretty bad but once you get used to it, it's easy to navigate. Overall I would recommend this game to people.Come back and play! This game needs a community!!^_^			"

												You want that sweet Pyro hat right?  Well I hope you have plenty of time on your hands, because you rank up at the lowest pace imaginable.  you can completely dominate in blitz and then get ♥♥♥♥ on when you go to see how much xp you get.  I was lucky to get 12 xp after annhialating in blitz.  Honestly, even just the gameplay modes are a huge joke.  It's just frantically jumping around and dodging endless amounts of robot fire, hoping to spray down a moneyball for 5 minutes.  So those looking for that Pyro hat, this game is not worth it, i'm sorry, just move on without it.			"

												I played this game when it first came out.  The game itself is quite a bit of fun.  But unfortunately two things kill it.  The absolutely horrible player base.  Little kids who do nothing but yell at each other.  One day maybe games will require age restrictions to play and things will improve.  The second thing is no match making.  You get people who played for literally a year playing with people who just started today lol.  That killed it.  The game is dead.  If you are looking for a 3rd person moba try smite, its an actual moba.			"

												While the concept of this game might be good, it is a bit badly done.* Some things need real rebalancing. For example:- You can grab enemies in melee range and perform a cool animation which makes them lose a chunk of HP. Sounds neat, right? While doing that, everyone can shoot the two players and the poor victim can be grabbed afterwards. There are issues with who grabs who first and in the end of the animation, the victim gets kicked forward, so he can fall into a pit & die. You can make it worse by getting a product, which sets anyone who you grapple / grapples you on fire.- There is a class skill in the game that spams your screen with colorful, spinning ads (from the game, not actual ones) while also covering your HP which is in the upper middle of the screen.- Some classes have trap skills. Those can't be destroyed by enemy team as far as I know.- Some of the items, skills deal either terribly little damage or way too much.- Some bots have pretty huge AoE attacks that throw you back. Often out of the field. Respawn time takes up to 40 seconds later in the game.* The game is a bit dead.			"

												High skill gaps, overpowered everything. No chance of winning unless you've been playing for a long time. High levels have tons of extra advantages and do nothing but steam roll everyone. Your damage is like 4 hp per shot while their damage is like 1/3 of your health. Even when you play safe, you have no chance of even getting a kill while you can't even leave your spawn. The shooting is no better than mediocre and the MOBA elements do not satisfy anyone.I thought this game being broken and unbalanced were just beta problems, but even now the game is horrendous.0/100			"

												i  m not sure what to write here but here a recipe of pancakeIngredients:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs, at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

 What would've been an amazing game destroyed by poor execution The only people who play anymore are either here for TF2 hats, OP level 100 players with all items, or just straight up hackers.So, what does togera think of SMNC?I like the game, the game is fun, the characters are funny and memorable but why can't I reccommend it?Most of the time your loadouts, Costumes, Products, or whatever will not even save after hitting save.Empty lobbies...and the never ending que...Hackers.....Hackers...(script kiddies as far as the eyes can see...)Overpowered Classes+Op products+Endorsements = *Your going to have a bad time.The worst part about the hackers is there is no vote kick and no first person spectate so you have to go and download the matches replay to watch them and see if they were cheating or not!The only lobbies that work are Turbocross and all the private matches, all the rest will plunge you into a never ending que.

												Dead, boring, and repetitive. One of the worst excuses of a Pay-To-Win game. It seems as if many reviews note that the only reason they downloaded this game was for the TF2 hats which, surprise, aren't worth it.0/10 IGN			"

												I saw many reviews of this game saying this game has a terrible matchmaking... of course it have because the game is already dead, but if much more people starts playing this game, the matchmaking is good. i played this game when the game has not ''dead'', and the matchmaking has good ;)This game is good, so much fun, intensive in some way, a new way of moba in my opinion.This game don't deserve to be dead, and the community of SMNC could be better but for that,this game needs a lot more players to play. A perfect community don't exist ;)It will be hard on beginning to learn, but if you play FPS games and games like dota 2, it won't be so hardJUST DOWNLOAD AND PLAY :D			"

												After a brief 10 or so minute match, I remember why I hate this game. Stupid lame-♥♥♥ leavers who suffer no repercussions other than the fact they will have to wait for the game to finish (but if you dont wanna play it, its not like you cant just go play another game), dumb ♥♥♥ teammates who think anything is possible if you insta-lock the commando and go for grab kills on a tank who is 2 levels above you and worst of all - ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t connection services. At the start of the game, there were about 200 more Europeans than North Americans playing this game. Now, there are about 60 Europeans playing and about 700 North Americans which leaves you only one choice - to play on a server that is on the other side of the world and hope that the enemies are from Europe as well, but if they aren't - massive NA advantage over us Europeans. The gameplay is solid and fun, but only if you have friends to play it with, and even so, endorsements and products make the game too OP for any newcomers.			"

												Well, this game, although people say is much better than Team Fortress 2, is not! This game:Has awful graphicsHas player view (in case you forget what team you're on or something?)Has VERY AWFUL GRAPHICSHas bad gameplayCharges you to play with much more strange and useless charactersHas Spells maybe? It's hard to tell because the graphics become so bad!What even is it?Who came up with the name, for god's sakeTry and find your way around this! It's like a maze!2/10 At least they have combat (which is hard to understand, mind you)Save Yourselves! And your PCs!			"
