												How can this even be considered a football management game? It is just roulette with players non-stop. You cannot stop anyone from signing your players and you cannot renew contracts with higher asking prices because players reject them. Players do not recognize when you offer them more wages in exchange for higher transfer asks. This is just a really awful game in all. I had a player whos agent asked me for 118,500 per season and a 850,000 transfer sum, well, I offered him 500,000 per season and a 25,000,000 transfer sum, he rejected. Tried again and offered him 10,000,000 per season and a 10,000,000 transfer sum and he rejected it. I tried this with every player just to test it and every player just declines.There is no way to call this a football manager game at all.			"

												awful, gimmicky, dull..... the match engine pays little attention to your tactics you pick, individual player orders are non-existant... training is shocking, i mean, you are limited to how many players you can train.... a number of language trnslation discrepancies within the game.... inability to 'sort' player by skill, position etc... having to go to one screen to do one thing then going onto another screen to another, and keep flitting about between screens is laboursome....the command function...Wtf?? really, just buy fifa if you want direct input into a football game, or buy Fm20xx series of games if you want a decent manager game.... this is very much like fifa manager , except(gasp....!!) less depth...

												This is not a Football Management Game, it's a ""player defense game"", I can't concentrate on tactics and matches because after every match the risk is to lose 2-3 players every time if I don't increase wage and decrease player's clause. It's stressful and frustrating. Without this problem this game would probably be ok. Probably. Sadly it's not Pc Futbol.			"

												FCS is a realtime managing soccer game, with heavy on the managing part. You can pause it and issue commands to the players but they rarely live up to wishes. You pick the cards you want to bring in to the game and hope for the best, but more then once the opponent crushed me easily just by scoring from half the field. Clearly iam not a good manager. I recommend the game but you need to give it some time before you starts to understand it.			"

												The overall concept of the game is pretty fun and reasonably easy to get used to.  major problems that do need to be fixed are;-the game crashes all the time/save files keep corrupting (could just be me). -other teams keep buying my players even though i just signed them 2 games ago. -the value of players needs a touch up. Also you can only decline or accept a clubs offer.-counter offers need to be added.6.5/10 if the above things got fixed/adjusted in the future it could even push for an 8/10.			"

												My score is 7/10. Interesting, entertaining and a bit addictive. It's perfect for those that enjoy managing your own soccer team. Not easy but not too much challenging, so you can spend a nice time playing it. There are some bugs but, as i could see, they aplied fixes frequently. Give it a chance, as far as i'm concern, it has been a good spend of money.			"

												The game looks nice, it is a game which shows the football simulation witha a personal touch. It's certainly has some bugs and that can disturb when playing. But it looks thaht they are solving and fixing the bugs.Also, it's another philosophy of the game and you see a tendency to set the guidelines themselves and create a model of game that is enjoyable and entertaining.My opinion is that this game is seen potential and can become a very good game. We have to see the evolution of the game, that have a lot of work.			"

												I’ve had a lot of fun being able to make my team greater. And i’ve loved the possibility of making decisions during the match, and not only during the week. Being able to choose the starting lineup, adjust the tactics, sign new players, expand the arena... the interface allows everything to be smooth, fast, and fun.			"

												The game is fun to play and the idea is good. However the game crashes constantly, it is unstable. As a software developer I understand this happens, so please give us a time line on when are you guys going to fix the problem, until then I will just keep practicing on the game.			"

												This devs are obviously not going to solve the ""quit to desktop"" issue; i have given them more than 4 months to solve this issue but im not going to support them anymore. My review is now negative; they haven't solved a sh*t and they don't do anything about it..I'm sorry but you are irresponsible and your game is full of bugs; this is not even an Alpha and you label it as a finished game.. shame on you.-------------------------OLD REVIEWGame still have some bugs (like shutting down during 2nd season).But im sure they will work around it and solve it asap.I liked it so far; it's more arcade than simulator and i am not looking for a too complex game such as FM16.-----------------------------			"
