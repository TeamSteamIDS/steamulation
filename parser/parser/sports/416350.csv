												This is quite possibly the worst $5 ive ever spent, the controls are awful and it only offers partial gamepad support. You don't even have to press any buttons to start rolling backwards in pre season. There is an option to configure controls but it was not detecting my gamepad. Seems like a mobile port.			"

												3.2/10 - Mini Bikes Bring on Micro Fun!This game could have been a winner with a few tweaks; however these didn't happen and you are left with a pretty poor racing game. The biggest complaint is the actual racing; if you fall behind the pack there is no chance of catching back up. This really sucks since there are interesting maps, power-ups different racing modes.The game really got me excited with the power-ups; it reminded me of our beloved Mario Kart. The problem is if you aren't in a pack of racers you will never get to really utilize these power-ups since the map is so curvy and the other racers will already be half a lap in front of you. No controller support and barely enough keyboard customization. Worth $0.20-0.30; just so you can make a profit with the cards. Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

												Ok, i watched the trailer to the game and i tought: ""this game looks cool""Well, its notThis game is pretty much a Mario Kart, but for mobile port and then converted to pcIs it good? Well, lets see:PROS:-Driving is kinda cool-Variety of Power UpsCONS:-Physics are terrible-At the start, races seem impossible to win-AI crashes into you, you get wiped-Players bike starts flying out of nowhere-Tracks are kinda booring-Game informations says that it has multiplayer... where?-Graphics are terrible-You crash into AI, you get wipedThis game as potential but as it stands right now, you should avoid it.

												It's not a bad little game, controls are a little tricky to master but after a couple of races it's a piece of cake. The only downside is the front lobe lobotomy AI players, no concievable race-line whatsoever, I always feel uneasy when lapping the slower bikes, get past 'em quick otherwise they'll crash into you because they have all the track etiquette of a seagull.

												- Awful collision detection- Moronic AI- Terrible controls- Bad physics- Little controller support- Poor optimization- No online multiplayer- Leaderboards don't workHowever I am a big fan of MotoGP and the characters are cute. As much as I hate this game, the amount of time I've spent on it shows that I've found it fun.Only play if you're a big MotoGP fan.			"

												If this game got released more than 5 years ago it could be a lot of fun. But it's kind of bad. In terms of steering.But sounds are also not pleasant.			"

												I like games like this, ofcourse with gamepad. Unfortunately it's a first game which I can't force using my gamepad property. I can't set accelerate or brake (my minibiker accelerate or brake all the time without my action). Game launcher - nothing. Game setting - nothing, x360ce - no effect, same with JoyToKey and Xpadder. So I give up. Sad :(			"
