												Started off good, but its too easy to get stuck.   If you do someting wrong, move out of turn, throw a piece off the board, make an illegal move, your just stuck there clicking every button hoping someting will change.  no message, just stuck and forced to re-set.   after a few re-sets, i had to bial.  Keep trying guys, I'm not going to ask for a refund (was only .99c) and hope that you improve the product.   Good luck.			"
