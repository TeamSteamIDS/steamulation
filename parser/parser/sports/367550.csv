												If you love Sports Management Sims and Rugby League, this is the game for you. Various updates over the 2013 edition, including a 3D (kind of?) Game Day which is a joy to watch compared to the 2D sprites we're used to. Pick your favourite NRL or SL team and take them to victory. Or even pick a lower tier team just for fun, such as a US team and build them into a force.Upon tinkering with the game a bit more, I highly recommend you read the Starters Guide from the launch menu. It will help you tremendously. I also recommend you take your time to learn the game properly; it's very daunting at first but when you sink a couple of hours into it and fully learn the mechanics, it is very rewarding.The only downside I can see is there are a fair few teams/championships lacking proper logos which were included in the 2013 Edition. Hopefully these can be sorted out in the future, I may have to play around with the Player Editor (also a great feature) and see if I can fix some names and player stats manually. The game is also very pricey which may deter a few people. But I've sunk 50+ hours into the 2013 edition and with modern rosters I can't wait to sink 500+ into this one. This game isn't for anyone, but if you're a Rugby League enthusiast who wants a Sim game akin to Football Manager, this is just for you.			"

												pretty ordinary, no way this is worth $40USD. feel pretty ripped off honestly. the developers havent done their homework on the NRL what so ever. apparently Luke Robinson (Huddersfield Giants) is a better half back than Adam Reynolds (South Sydney) John Sutton is listed as the Rabbitohs best goal kicker even though he is only 7/15 lifetime 58%. seems like a massive super league bias when i look through the ratings of players. they dont understand how the NRL Feeder teams work. the NSW cup teams seem to work as their own entity with their own players. none are associated with the parent NRL teams as they have their own reserve squads and junior teams.

												Rugby League is my first sport. I have played semi pro and watch every game i can. This game in places can be a little basic for example during contract talks and transfers. The UI is difficult to handle also but is picked up over time. That said i highly recommend this game to any league fan. It is the only real manager game for this sport and they also has full backing from all the teams, meaning that all the players are on there with full profiles and pictures and all the teams have official names and stadiums. Once you get past the awkward UI the game is huge and quiet detailed. This game allows you to manage all aspects of running your own club from training to finances and all in between. You are able to start with a sunday league team right up to super league and international. As a Wigan fan they were my first team and it was fun interacting with the players i know and love. As a side note season 2015 is warringtons year ;-P			"

												Finally, the day has dawned when there's a rugby league management game of real, genuine quality. It isn't perfect but this is a huge day for the sport as we finally have a management game to be proud of. If you are willing to learn the nuances of what you can do here, this title is as in depth as any you might come across in any other sport. It isn't perfect and will need to evolve over time, but this is the first game in a new franchise and is a fantastic effort. I was fortunate enough to have early access and I am addicted. You can take a tiny club up and down the divisions (my spell in charge of my local team Blackbrook resulted in relegation before immediate redemption the season later) and the level of detail you can work on is huge. Stadia, academies, training facilities, gyms and so on. Each one will chip away at making your team better and making more available to you. The 3D match engine is surprisingly impressive and you can see the calls and tactics you come up with being put into practice, which is a really good feeling when you have success. You can have team calls that work with your preferred style of play. You can concentrate on attack like Leigh or you can concentrate on the gritty, rough defence like a Shaun Wane ""inspired"" WIgan. There is so much detail to go through that you can have different experiences in different leagues. Different tactics prosper in the lower levels when you have less tactical nous at your disposal. The NRL has a higher standard of player and will not hesitate to punish you or your team for making errors or not being fit enough. I can't praise this enough - it isn't as vast as Football Manager and anyone expecting it to be so is being unrealistic. The difference in budget is massively pronounced. But it is absolutely the king of Rugby League management games, and it is a crown that I have been waiting for a title to take for a very long time.  Well,well worth a buy if you love rugby league.

												It is with a heavy heart that I give this a thumbs down.You don't know for how many years I badly wanted a game like this and here it is and it's not what I wanted exactly. It's getting there though and I thank you for the effort!Cons-Interface is unappealing and a chore to navigate.-Hard for a new player to get a handle on what they are doing. -Ratings are way off on some players(Adam Reynolds who is South Sydney's number 1 goal kicker and premiership winning halfback is average, when someone like Alex Johnston is instantly World Class on the back of one good season? 2 players in the Souths squad yet to make their first grade debut have more value than Adam Reynolds? If I start a game I may as well sign a new halfback to replace the one I have who is one of the best in the game in real life!)-Some players are missing entirely. I understand someone like Kirisome Auva'a being suspended for almost the entire 2015 season might have been hard to simulate in-game but you'd have been better off having him unrealistically available from the start than not to have him in at all.Pros-It's a Rugby League Management game.-The development team to time to actually make a freaking Rugby League management game and they came as close as they did to getting it right!-One of my initial concerns has been changed from a con into a pro and that is the Australian League system is set up unrealistically. Why is that now a good thing? From a gaming perspective, I have come to realise that I much prefer taking teams and battling for promotion and against relegation than like what a more realistic simulation of the Australian game would be. What would be the point of ever managing North Sydney in the NSW Cup(or any lower grade Australian team) if the NRL team I am the feeder club for keeps taking my good players and all I have to play for at the end of the day is the NSW Cup? With promotion and relegation added in, I can actually get North Sydney to the NRL and battle against the best teams in Australia for a competition trophy that actually means something! I now hope they never fix this! (or if they do, there's 2 modes of the game where you can play either a realistic simulation or the current setup).I understand that some of my examples of cons are rather specific but I've seen similar concerns that people have with their own favourite teams so I think they are valid points.Some things I'd suggest.-Tidy up the interface and just generally make it more user friendly for player of all skill levels.-Work on the ratings of players. If your development team is small, get some volunteers like FM do. If I had the tech knowhow I'd be more than willing to volunteer for rating for some players.-Have more happen at the start of the game to draw a player in. I remember playing International Cricket Captain and you'd go through budget phases and signing players to contracts and setting up training for the next few weeks and so on.As things are, it's a thumbs down but if you're undecided and reading my review and you can get it really cheap, you love Rugby League and don't mind tinkering with some ratings at the start, it'd be a thumbs up.Edit: I notice someone marked my review as 'unhelpful' How in the hell was my review unfair? I wasn't needlessly critical, I tried to be constructive with my review and gave suggestions as to what I thought could improve and you'll notice that despite giving it a thumbs down I thank the developers for their efforts and even advise undecided people that this game might currently be a thumbs down from me but it might not necessarily be for you!You're a jerk random thumbs down person!Edit:-I notice 3 people now have given a thumbs down to my review.Is it because It says 3.5 hours played? Ever thought that because of crappy internet connections in regional Australia that maybe I play steam games offline? Especially ones that don't have any need to be online like this game.Edit:-It's now up to 5 people marking it unhelpful? *Tears remaining hair out, dresses in black and writes bad poetry in a graveyard*			"

												As a massive RL fan and someone that has been playing management games for 20+ years I have to say this has some ups but many more downs. The ups - Finally a licensed RL manager game is released, that probably is the only upGood player listingsThe downs - Massively overpriced for what you get.5 minutes game time to complete a set of six tackles which in real life take 60 seconds - that is a joke to let that slip thru to the end product. 15 years behind leading sports manager games - football manager seriesLay out is confusing, looks animated and very amateurishWatching game play is like a throw back to old EA sports games more than a decade agoPop up menu at each click makes me want to drop a bowling ball on my footPlayer stats very inaccurate, actual salary cap is nothing like real life, player wages inaccurateThe more I play the more I am disappointed, the RL had a great chance to put their brand on something good.But this is what was produced, I hope someone will go check out the FM series of games and suggest they geta serious management game going in 2016 based on facts and not fantasy from someone sitting in a room somewherethrowing this into a bowl and saying ""here you go everyone, its a fantastic RL Manager package"".......... it is not.I would wait until this game is on special before you buy it, you will get sick of it very quickly and return to more credible manager games like the FM series. Fingers crossed if this RL games continues the developers will bin this and have a serious rethink, older sports management game players dined out on this stuff pre 2000. Do better next time, much better.			"

												This is a decent stand alone pc game. Pros :- Best rugby league management game available- Real time match interaction engine is very good- Many different tactical paths to take- Becomes addictive to play after a whileCons :- Lower level leagues don't have proper logos- Transfers are too light hearted- Screen resolutions are limited- If you compare this game to the 20 year running, 100 man strong Football Manager series, you'll see the gulf in quality and budget			"

												An excellent basis for the series to push on but feels slightly dated for a modern management game in places, though an excellent effort considering the size of the development team and resources available to them.Nicely detailed with licensed teams and players, youth systems, good tactical options to play the style you like, ability to upgrade all sorts of club facilities, player pictures also a nice touch.Just needs polishing in some areas, for example, by making the user-interface smoother and easier to navigate and improving the match day presentation to look more 2015-like (matchday can be satisfying at times when you're watching your players implement your tactics as you want, but it would be nicer for it to be prettier, as when you've spent hours perfecting your tactical plan you want the reward of being able to watch it implemented as something nicer to look at. Team selection needs to be made a smoother process (changing positions around can be a touch tedious). Also contract/transfer negotiations are too simple and easy.Overall a very enjoyable game that's essential for any Rugby League / management sim fan. Look forward to further, improved installments.Additional note: Please pay for the game and support the small development team so they can continue the series.			"

												i love sports management games and rugby league was one ive been waiting for ages. At first when i opened up the game i wasn't sure what to expect, and after playing a season and a half I realise it was an alright purchase. i mean was it worth 40$USD maybe not, but you will be spending hours on end trying to get the right set up and the right team. i do wish that buy players was a little bit more different, the look of the game feels a little bit 'cheap'. cant move teams beside controlling rep teams, cant make your own manager have to take control of the current manager, they are just some of the little annoying things i had with the game. things i do like about the game the tactics aspect was interesting, controlling everything to do with the team from alliance squad to u21s to the main team, bring players up from each squad, to finance aspect. it is a nice game and do hope next year they do make it better and tweak with some of the issues. 6.5/10			"

												I'm a big fan of sports management sims and I wanted to learn a little bit about rugby, so I gave this game a shot. It has a rough interface, but once you tinker around with it for a couple of hours, you can work through it. It's basically set up exactly like a simplified Football Manager, so anyone familiar with that series can probably figure this one out rather quickly.It's not overly complex and it's fairly easy to take advantage of the other teams to build up one's own club and get out of unwanted contracts, but it's amusing. Breezing through while letting the AI work out most of the tactical stuff makes the game inviting enough, even for someone with no knowledge of the sport. I did manage to learn how rugby works in the process, so I'm pleased. I'm a little confused as to why this company feels the need to release two separate products for each type of rugby given that both are very similar, but I guess that that's how things work.			"

												I have previously played RLM2013 and RLM2011, which were freeware. The game is not hugely removed from RLM2013, save for a 3D match engine, some ""feats"" (special once a match boosts awarded to your team when your player skill counts are better than your opponents) and up to date data base incorporating the new ""Super 8"" ""Middle 8's"" and ""Lower 8's"" league play off structure.  Overall I enjoy playing this game. It is the only decent RL managment sim and if you like RL I would recommend you bought it. Don't worry about ""value"" - a fairer price in my view would be about £20, but I will happily pay a tenner to the top man who has invested time in making an RL game (Union seems to rule, and I am really not interested in club Union). For constructive feedback,  I do think it could be improved with a little more polish. Team names could include background and font colours in tandem with team colours (rarher than just black and white/grey), team logos are not present for international and rep games (if offical RFL/NRL backing held, why on earth not?). These are easy and cheap wins I think.  Better presentation on the 3D engine would be helpful too - though FIFA Football quality is obviously not expected would be good to see something at least as good as FM2014. There's also too many dodgy named Albanians and Nigerians etc created (I know RL has some global reach but never seen an Albanian RL and my London Broncos team now has an international calibre Albanian..really?!Still a worthy game and worth it if you like RL.

												At long last, rugby league fans have a management simulation to enjoy. RL is quite a small sport, certainly when compared to football, but given the success of Football Manager over the years it always puzzled me that fans of rugby league didn't have the opportunity to enjoy a cerebral, strategic management game given the tactical nature of the sport.Well, now we do.There's a 3D match engine, which you can change to a 2D top-down style if that's your preference, and you can see the plays and tactics you selected being carried out by your players. How your team plays is totally up to you - recruit speedy backs and play a wide, expansive game or construct a juggernaut of a pack to rumble over the opposition. In defence it's entirely your choice as to whether your boys concentrate on conserving their own energy and just make the tackles, or whether it's a case of grinding the opposition players down with bone-crunching 3-man tackles.The level of detail is absolutely staggering; there are real people I know playing for tiny amateur clubs who are in the game's database. The research that has gone into this title is truly impressive and I don't doubt that many an amateur player will buy this game and be surprised to find himself in there.I look forward to this game turning into a successful series and really growing its fanbase. If you like rugby league, if you like strategy games, if you like football management games and fancy a challenge, get into this.			"

												I would love to give this game a recommend, unfortunately due to the pricetag, I can't justify it.I am a hardcore Rugby League fan, and as such I enjoy the game - it's fun to take my favourite Rugby League team (and indeed my local NCL team) and try to gain success, however there are some key issues with the game which need raising, and in my opinion make it unworthy of the full £30 (GPB) price tag:1. The interface is clunky, the colour scheme depends on what team you're playing with, and as a Castleford Tiger manager the bright orange is just offensive.  The navigation around screens is difficult, requiring a player to enter and exit multiple screens to do simple things - instead of simply selecting a player and being given menus to deal with them (for example, contracts, physio, doctor, etc.) one has to navigate to different pages for each action one wants to take.  This at present is the largest failing of the game in my opinion, and one which I hope is worked on significantly in future.2. There are inaccuracies in the game which could be easily rectified with some simple research - for example the number of representative games is not reflected by real life (although I do enjoy being able to coach Yorkshire in the War of the Roses series), whilst some players cannnot be picked for the correct representative teams (The Burgess brothers, all Yorkshire born and bred, are only eligible for Lancashire in my game) - Whilst this can be fixed with the editor, I feel it should not fall on the player to input simple correct information into the system.3. The game, whilst fun, is still one in it's infancy in terms of features and depth - whilst this would not normally be a criticism, it is the main reason I am not giving the game a recommend - the full £30 price tag is not justified by a game lacking in depth as this does. A more reasonable £10-15 would have changed this from a no-recommend to a recommend.Examples of the lack of depth include player contracts/transfers, the relationship between player and manager (the ""morale"" system simply seems to be a case of giving players down on morale some game time), game mechanics that allow for a little more in-game strategy and tactics (perhaps creating ones own attacking moves?).So, tl;dr:1. Interface is clunky and hard to manage, and downright offensive to look at if playing with certain teams.2. Many mistakes in the database.3. Game is not deep enough in content to justify the price tag.If you are a hardcore Rugby League fan with £30 to spare then it may be worth getting the game to sate your desire for an RL management game, furthermore I do hope that the developers go on to produce further, more polished versions of the game.  This game is not a bad effort, and I honestly wish I was given options other than simply ""Yes"" or ""No"" on the recommend front (a ""Depends"" would be nice).			"

												Massively DisappointingAs a lifelong rugby league fan and lifelong sports management game fan, I was greatly pleased (and surprised) to see this appear on Steam.I willingly coughed up £30 (which seemed expensive) out of enthusiasm and intent to back a smallish developer, who've produced a game for a niche market.  A mistake.The game feels like an abstraction of Rugby League, rather than remotely realistic.  The matches don't play out realistically as the match clock ticks over at a speed which means each team only get a handful of sets of six each half, hugely impacting on the scores etc.  A big mistake and one which should not have been made.  A much better idea is to adopt the Football Manager style of highlights or actually watch a complete match with action accelerated at accelerated time, so everything would play out better.The playcall system where you can boost defence etc temporarily plays out like a weird card game during a match - again, bizarre and not realistic.I could list more but I won't. It's not fair to compare to the behemoth that is Football Manager, but compared to deep (yet relatively low budget) management games like OOTP Baseball and Front Office Football, this seems like a lame duck.  And more expensive too.  I don't like bashing games and devs, but I have to say something here.  £10 might be a fair price for this for some.Game uninstalled after 2-3 hrs play.So imagine my excitement when I see that Steam offer refunds (amazingly I'd never realised before).  And imagine my disappointment when Steam tell me my application for a refund is rejected on the grounds that I bought it too long ago.So £30 for 2-3hrs of ""experience"". Not good guys.OK - so it's the best rugby league management game?  No competition though - it's like saying it's the best looking turd in the sewer.EDIT: For a decent RL game, buy the latest Rugby League Live game - it isn't management as such but it has a career mode/be a pro mode and is a good game.

												I definitely think there is potential. The NRL and Australia leagues have been a bit poorly implemented. Also, some of it is rather confusing. Particularly the training etc... I was getting breached for not enough players being promoted and it took forever to work out how to actually fix this. By far the worse bit has to be the presentation. I find it awkward and ugly. However, there's definitely some good things within it. I think the games themselves work well and definitely a good base. Hopefully, the developer takes some feedback and works to improve the game itself. I'm happy to support it, but there's still a bit of work to go.			"

												[This is my opinion]As a big rugby league fan, I do absolutely love this game, and will spend many hours on this game in the future. I played the 2013 version of this game and there is definitely a huge improvement. Good points:- Ability to change between 2D and 3D match views.- Realistic Super League Squads (Updated 2016)- More Realism- Includes the Magic Weekend fixtures & World Club Series Matches (St James' Park, Newcastle. Although not sure whether the 2013 game included this or not)Bad Points:- The menu systems can be hard to navigate for new users, however a rough tutorial is supplied.- I experience a bug at the end of matches, meaning I have to re-launch the game, and re-play the match.As a Rugby League Fan, the game is fantastic and enjoyable. There are a few little things that could be improved, but it's nothing big. I recommend any rugby league fan, NRL or Super League to buy this game. "

												Its a decent effort, finally we have a RL Manager game!Takes a little patience to get into the game but once you're into the game its easy to get addicted.Like any new game it needs a little work. As I've seen in other reviews more research on player quality is needed, it beggars belief that some players ratings are higher than others.As a proud Yorkshireman, I took over Yorkshire for the representative games only to find my star players - Sam, Tom and George Burgess are in the Lancashire team, when they should be available for Yorkshire. Funnily enough the one Burgess I didnt want, Luke was available for Yorkshire)Good start to what is hopefully a yearly project, with a litte more research into player stats RLTM could become a massive success. I'm sure that there are people out there willing to volunteer with player stats and profiles.			"

												As a big player of FootBall Manager series, I am very disapointed by this game ...This game looks like it has been developped more than 15 years ago, do not buy it more than 10 bucks ... it does not worth it's current price.			"

												I would recommend this game if you are a rugby league fan as it is arguably the best simulated rugby league game however my game regularly randomly crashes unsure if it's just my pc or the game itself			"

												Have been liking the game until the 2016 season update. Unable to play previous saved games as it crashes. Any help to have the updates and continue to play previously saved games?			"

												I could say a lot about this game,good or bad........If I had to some up this game with some typical quote I would maybe say ""shows potential"" or ""work in progress"" I've decided to put it up as I do recommend this game because I personally judge this as the best of a bad situation.I've been waiting years for a game of this type as an avid rugby fan and gamer I have mixed memories of the ""Rugby League"" and ""Rugby League Live"" games but besides Rugby League 2/3 which are both way out of date now and honestly there ""franchise"" modes are so minor in comparison to this game,I'm just glad to see a rugby league team management simulator.In terms of good qualities,the amount of detail added to the rosters was pretty incredible the fact that amateur clubs rosters are the actual rosters is very nice.The ability to manage any country,state of origin,war of the roses side is very enjoyable.The simple fact is this a genuine rugby league game which at least has detail and the ability to represent your favourite players and clubs.Now negatives the price I'm sorry but this isnt really good value for money,the price is simply too high for the game.The player calibre system,I understand it and I hate it,the fact that every champ player gets proff and has pretty much no chance of ever doing better is an embarassment,like a factor is Jordan Lilley who played for Featherstone was Proffesional however now hes on Leeds would be National.This system is flawed and I hope that they either scrap the system or they make a way to jump between calibres.This game needs to upgrade the NRL players to be a lot higher than the SL even as a Super League supporter I must say that the NRL deserves a higher grade than SL.To summarise if you are like me and desperate for a new Rugby League game,go for it but if youre not too bothered I'd say there's a lot of better games for your money.

												In my opinion this is extremely over price.Downside:-Constant pop ups everytime i went to another section.-Confusing if you have never play this game before trying to find your way around the UI.-getting a warning email, making the correct change but still getting the same email over and over again?-compared to other sport management games very poor.-Championship manager 2010 (diff sport i know) is a much better game all round, and thats from 5/6 years ago?! -Extremely over priced.Goodpoints?!-if your looking for a rugby leage sim, perfect.

												Recently downloaded Rugby League Team Manager, for the Rugby League community its a god send of a game, its a niche game. Good thing about the game is that it is also moddable, I recommend any RL fan to get this game.			"
