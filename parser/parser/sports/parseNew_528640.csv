												considering i read somewhere this was a 'completetly rebuilt' game and not a update to 2015 - i'm massively disappointed so far. the transfer market is exactly the same, players aged 21 or 33 at the same level are valued the same, you cant even see the transfer market, loan list or freebies - you have to scout it each time (so if you only have 1 scout and send him out looking at the player, team, league - then your screwed). i get that you need to 'scout' players but why can you scout all transfer listed players instantly and get their stats, yeah if i wanted to just view one player (george north for example) - i would need to either scout his club, position and have to wait a few days. masking player stats would have been a better way of handling this. frankly the transfers opperate awful.one of the bit user feedback on 2015 - was the interface, still as frustrating at before - and because there are more features, its takes longer to remember everything.staff - as far as i can see, every staff member in the world is employeed??? am missing something, so again you have to scout staff and then a 'transfer fee' for the staff member. to promote and talk about 'new manager profiles' .... wow desperate times, its one or the other, thats the feature!i really enjoyed the first game and put in nearly 100 hours, this after 2 hours i was massively disappointed, is it better than 2015 - yes of course, but its no where near what i expected. will this negatvie review be amended down the line to a positive - possibly! for me, its a facelift, and a poor one at that, majortity of the game is the same as 2015, and for £30 its expensive... especially compared to other recent releases around the same price point (FM17, motorsport manager and planet coaster)			"

												10hrs GP:I've played the game for 10 hours now and I have so far only experienced one bug, so I'm not sure what other people are doing, maybe it's their OS? The menus aren't very laggy, taking less than a second for each click to respond and load the corresponding request, so I don't really know how much quicker people want it?The game is very enjoyable, and is definitely like many other strategy games, I've just reached Christmas and I've now got a set tactical game plan, and I've promoted a few academy players. I've slowly overhauled my staff and the team training is much more effective.I think the problem is, because the game looks rough, it's hard to see past this on first viewing. It's the same as every game, when you get used to the interface, everything is quicker and you look past what it looks like and instead focus on what it does.Would still recommend!2hrs GP:Right, firstly I need to say this will be a working review even though I am reviewing after 2 hours, because I feel there needs to be some balance after seeing the first couple of reviews.It's rough and ready, but it's good. You can't compare it to Football Manager and their level of detail as they have much more money and have been developing the game over decades, not a couple of years. Plus rugby is far more complex in terms of tactics and positioning.The database is a bit iffy, Manu Tuilagi has around 40 power, and Harry Thacker has apparently reached his potential at the age of 22. However, I restarted the game a few times, and the attributes and potentials changed for just about all the players. So I feel the game may have a randomiser similar to Football Manager where it randomises some attributes to create an original experience each time you start a game. It creates an air of luck, it is a game and you can't expect to replicate real life exactly.When playing, there isn't a database of players, you must scout for the position/team/league, and then view the players from there. This for me is more realistic: attributes, value, potential, injures etc. all change from day to day, so it doesn't make sense to have a spreadsheet full of players, you need to scout them!My favourite feature is during the match, you can choose the kind of kick off, choose the play you're going to do off your set piece, and choose what to do for a penalty. Which gives you much more control compared to just watching the players do it themselves.The match engine is a bit raw, but it's only been a few years in development, what do you expect? The defensive positioning is poor, but it is just a game, you can't expect to see or implement a Paul Gustard style blitz defence. The interface is rough and it's not the cleanest or neatest. But it is understandable at the very least and I feel I'm getting my head around it.Give the game a go, it is enjoyable, but don't expect it to blow you away.			"

												Massive problems with this game! There are a number of instances and triggers which cause the game to stop working in the match engine. The game is almost unplayable at the moment!Major issues: -If the bell is kicked to touch in the opponent 5 metre, all the players will run round the ball endlessly, you have no option but to restart the game.- If the ball is kicked in to the 5 metre area or in to the dead ball area, the same thing happens.-If you click anything in the menu whilst the game is running as or immediately after the half time or full time whistle the game crashes.Medium issues- In the team picking screen you cannot always click ont he player you want to select, you first have to auto select the team and re-do the whole line-up, very frustrating if you just want to change one player.Minor issues-The scrum half sometimes puts the ball in on the wrong side of the scrum. Nowhere near game breaking, but surely this could've been noticed or fixed before release. As a prop forward this is bizarre to witness.If there issues are fixed I will, change my review to positive and amend the comments, as otherwise this game and series has massive promise. "

												Only played a few hours on this but a huge leap forwards from the last version. There are a few small bugs that need ironing out but I'm sure will be ironed out very soon, as patches released on a regular basis. Main bug I have found is that if the ball gets kicked into the 5 meter zone, the home team surround the ball and stand there. This has happened a couple of times and only way out is to reboot. The community have made mods for the logos and data which greatly improves the appearance and realism, hopefully someone will do a mod for the player pictures as the in game ones are very poor.On the whole a very good game with immense potential			"

												Was really excited to see the game available for Mac this time around and bought it at the slightly steep price of £29.99 (I think £19.99 is pobably more like it). It certainly isn't as detailed as Football manager but it has most of the features you want from a manager game and I'm pretty pleased with it overall.The main issues for me are as follows:1) The game engine isn't wonderful (I prefer 2D versions anyway). The twirly dance of doom that occasionally happens when your players kick forward is the main issue for me - the ball crosses the try line but even if you get there first you don't score the try - instead all the players dance around endlessly and you're forced to restart the game, which is annoying if you're winning!2) There are a few incorrect positions assigned to players which is maybe a tad lazy but can surely be remedied with a minor update.3) The absence of the Super 14 teams and players is a bit of a drag but again, with more licensing this can be sorted.Overall it's not perfect but it's still pretty good fun and ticks a lot of the boxes you'd expect from a sports management game. I look forward to the future updates which will make it even better.			"

												This is a positive step forward for this new franchise. A lot of people are dissatisfied because they might have been expecting a radical difference from 2015's version. If this is to become ""the FM of Rugby"" like everyone hopes then it is going to take time and steps will be tentative. The look of the game is, for me, much improved. I like the new menu and interface improvements, it feels fresh and definitely an improvement on the vanilla layout of last time. I do think the menu system is a bit complex and that the game needs a tutorial of sorts to get people into the swing of things. Gameplay wise, not much has changed but there has been attempts to move forward with new additions. There are several more needed - a generic ""search"" function for players and staff is badly needed but it doesn't stop signings - you can sign pretty much anybody that you want to eventually. It's nice to see that licenses have been added to and it would be a major coup if more could be obtained going forward. The updates released have settled the game down a bit and it's pretty solid now. The match engine has showed (in my opinion) a lot more ambition this year though that is something that can continually be improved and sometimes the game gets ahead of the engine.Overall I do like RUTM17. It isn't perfect and I wouldn't expect it to be. Two games into a franchise will not yet yield what everyone wants from the game but it's a positive step in the right direction for me.			"

												I don't usually play sports manager games, but I thought I'd give this a shot since I'd played rugby in the past. I'm glad to say that I ended up enjoying this game a lot. I really liked how immersive and realistic the game was, ranging the spectrum of emails, training sessions, facilities, finances, and more. It's clear that the developers really paid attention to detail and went in-depth with it in order to provide a strong gameplay experience.Initially it was a bit unclear to me how to play with the different settings, especially being able to control the team in individual games, but after a few ""Advance Screen""s I got the hang of it. Perhaps a more A-to-Z walkthrough entry in the manual, or just a walkthrough in general. I'd definitely rather the developers focused their energy on bugfixes and new feature additions though. And I think part of these perceived ""difficulties"" actually help make the game more accurate and realistic. For example, I had been neglecting my emails for a while (got too excited with the actual matches), and thus had missed some facilities warnings that led to me getting fined. I guess that's part of the process of actual sports management, in that you do frequently get overwhelmed and it's a lot to keep track of.Last but not least, the theme music is super catchy and lends a great energy to the entire experience. I'll have that rock song stuck in my head for a while to come. Kudos to the team at Alternative Software!			"

												Not a perfect rugby management game by a long way, but easily the best rugby management game available at the moment. It is better than the previous version of the RUTM with some much needed improvements. Certainly a must have for any Rugby Union fans who enjoy management games. It does take some getting used to so give yourself time to get used to the game			"

												I really hope that my review is able to help you; if you would like to know more, post a comment, and I will endeavour to answer.As a long time player of Cricket Captain and Football Manager, I was especially keen to get stuck into a management game focused on my beloved rugby.  I have not been disappointed - the game is really excellent, although there are a couple of things that I personally would like to see change.- I really like the interface - it is easy to navigate and easy on the eye.  - From a resource management point of view, this game is excelent - one has to manage finances, staff, players, a long term plan (attempting to please the board and also grow the stature and infrastructure of one's club etc).- Tactics: I really enjoy matches and the tactical side of things, although I slightly prefer the FM (and even early Championship Manager) approach of having sliders for everything.  The team calls are fun, but I would rather have to analyse my team's strengths and weaknesses, adjust a whole host of tactics with sliders (so I don't do silly things like try creative passes with a prop etc).  There is so much potential in rugby for multiple tactical elements one can control, from individual decisions, to varying team philosophies.  Some of this is already in the game of course.  One can vary one's attack ""expansiveness"" in 12 different zones on the pitch and change one's defensive system in 4 different zones on the pitch, but I think individual instructions for each position would also be nice.- Matches: These generate realistic score-lines and are enjoyable.  If you want a hands on approach, you can ad-lib defence and attack parameters and also decide when to kick, although it seems to be difficult to clear the ball to touch!  I'd personally like the clock to operate in real time, but with ""boring"" passages of play skipped (as in Football Manager).  If this were to be altered, one would then have more stats at the end of games for things like knock ons, penalties etc.Overall though, the matches as they are, are great, but I am sure that the developers are planning to improve the player animations, movements etc with time.

												I liked this game, Good update from the 2015 Version. Not as much detail as Football Manager and there are some statistical/Positional errors on some players. Also doesn't have rights for Southern hemisphere teams but still very enjoyable game,For the most part I think the 3D engine is quite good, and feels like you can definetely change the outcome of a tight match with tactical choices. Occasionally there are some issues with players running off the pitch and in silly directions but overal thr feel of the match is quite realisticOverall this game is a bit rough around the edges and could do with abit more depth, But is definetely an improvement on RUM 2015 and is definetley the best Rugby Management Game, available at the moment, So would reccomend a purchase if you like Rugby and Management games			"

												Good update from the 2015 version. The interface is much nicer and easier to move around. Lots of new things to get used to, such as the transfer system, getting staff etc. Also the changes during the match for choosing different plays, etc. is a very welcome change and makes games more fun to play. Obviously still a few issues, such as:- The defence is still rubbish, with players just randomly going walkabouts during the games. - Player ratings are all over the place, with random unknown players being the best on your team. - When any player gets sent off/sin binned, the no. 7 will move into his place and you can't move him back, which is quite annoying to have someone like Chris Henry playing at inside centre. But I do know it's a work in progress and will hopefully keep growing and I'll keep supporting.			"

												1.) The positives:If Rugby is your favourite sport, this is the best Rugby management sim currently  available to buy.The general feel of the game is pretty good - the layout is very simple and it doesn't take you too long to get used to navigating your way around and working out each little game facet..The player/league database is pretty accurate and up-to-date, although only certain teams from certain leagues are licensed (Aviva Prem, Pro 12, Top 14) and for some reason if you decide to coach international sides, the player's names are not licensed when they are called up to their international squads (something which I found slightly bewildering).Some of the competitions are also not licensed, eg: the Six nations is called the ""NH Nations"" - but if you can get past the lack of full licensing, this IS an enjoyable game.You can take over a club - build your club facilities, set your own tactics, bring through and cultivate your own youth teams, sign/loan players - even set your own ticket prices. I have spent many enjoyable hours so far, and I would normally reccommend a game like this -  however:2.) The negatives:If you are looking at this game, hoping for a Rugby Manager sim which is similar in style and execution to the Football manager game series - think again.  This is absolutely nothing like Football manager, it is clearly years behind in it's development.First of all, the tactical side of the game I found massively wanting - you only have the option of setting extremely basic game tactics.   You can manually select players for line-out and scrum, but that is about it.As a result, I quickly found a tactical system within about 1 hour of game time which was almost unbeatable, and with an average Northampton Saints team which has struggled in real life, I went the whole calendar year unbeaten, winning the treble in my first season. I repeated this feat for the next three seasons, using the same tactics, and almost the same players. I then took over as Italy manager and won the six nations grand slam at the first time of asking using the same tactics, beating england 40-0 in the process. Basically, this lack of in-depth tactics has made the game incredibly easy to beat - it is just not challenging or realistic whatsoever in this regard, which I thought was a a massive shame, as there is the basis of a good game there.The second major negative point is the 3-D match engine.  Far from the crisp graphics and smooth flow of the Football manager series, the 3-D engine on Rugby union Team Manager is one of the worst I've ever seen in a sports sim game.The players run around randomly, rucking at random intervals.  This chaos leads to an enormous amount of glitches, the most common of which are passes which go about 10 feet forwards yet are still counted as legal, and nearly always lead to a try. There is also a glitch which occurred in about 30% of my matches where sometimes a player would get possession of the ball, and run 50 metres the opposite way down the pitch to his own try line, and the ref would blow for a scrum to the other team in the try zone - sometimes even blow a try to the opposing team! When you're in the opposition try zone powering towards a 78th minute try to win the game and this happens to you, it's incredibly frustrating.  The only positive thing about the 3-D  match day engine is the team call system which is used - it makes for an interesting dynamic, but is incredibly frustrating to me because like the general game mechanics, there is the basis of a good game there, it just needs massive development.Overall, if you're a fan of Rugby, this is an enjoyable game, but it is so mind-numbingly easy and  incredibly riddled with bugs and glitches, that it is not worth it unless you are a seriously big fan of the sport like I am.At £29.99, this game is almost the same price as Football Manager, but it is absolutely light years behind it in terms of the experience it offers. I say this - don't waste your money. "

												This is an excellent game for diehard rugby union fans who want the opportunity to manage their own team. To start with you get to choose from hundreds of different teams to manage, across multiple divisions (I went for my home squad of Plymouth). I then got to go into the pre-season and choose who I wanted to play some friendlies against before we got into the proper matches. The amount of information displayed on the screen can be overwhelming at times but the game does assist you. When not sure what to do just click the Advance Screen button in the top and it will either take you to the next day or notify you of things that need doing. You get to sort out training sessions, manage and make repairs to the grounds, respond to bids from other teams and even sound out scouts to get some new talent for you. The lack of a descent in game tutorial does mean you will have to discover some of the features yourself, but the instruction manual gives a reasonable overview of most things. My favourite feature though is when your team plays a match you can either just simulate it and get the result straight away, or manage the match. Decide what to do during kick offs and choose plays during scrums and line outs. It’s a nice addition and you get to watch the match as it is being played out (sped up of course). If you are a fan of sports management games and love rugby then this is a solid game for you.			"

												So far the game is below ok. I think the menu layout could use a right click menu options to view specific information quickly and a pop up box explaining what each stat does within the game. One big note to developers is your 3d engine needs a massive improvement because I had to restart the game due to my players had the ball, decided to kick then suddenly every player in the match (including the opposition) started to go into a twirl like dance for the full 40 mins of the game. I could not do anything apart from restarting the game within match game menu.That the major disappointment of this game and will need to get rectified quickly. Thankfully the game has the option to simulate instead of choosing to watch the match in 3d but disappointingly even if choosing to simulate, there is no text commentary, straight to end result of the match. The 3d engine is crude, it like watching Domark's International Rugby Challenge which is bad, see reviews about the game on the internet, you get what I mean bad.It not Football Manager in terms of statistical depth of information but I feel it should be more polish for £30. Better choice text/colors to be easier on the eyes, more stats, better placement of information on-screen. It not £30 after playing the game, it should be £5 quid. If the Developers set the game at a bargin price at £5. I think you guys would have more favourable reviews and encouragements for a game that is may not be the Football Manager but not a bad attempt. If you going to set the price at £30 quid, then I expect this product to be quality not dog♥♥♥♥♥♥with bugs in the game code.£30 for a sub-par 3d engine, terrible music, terrible mouse clicking beeping sound for every menu option I click on (thankfully it can be turn off on the options menu) hard to read match anaysis, I should not need to be asked to choose team tactics which prevents the match to continue, it should continue to play either I choose a tactic or not and there are some interface design quirks within the game, for example, when checking a box to choose a specific task then I decide to uncheck the task, it would not?. It not garbage but it should be better for the price. Nah, Thumbs down.			"

												Once again we have been spoiled by Alternative software , giving us a awesome new rugby manager game , this years release featuring some great improvements on the previous version , if you have a look at the improvements it is clear that Alternative software does listen to its fans , I also want to give a big thank you to Dave and the rest of the Alternative software team for the quick response on the forum and keeping us up to date when steam was being a bit slow on releasing the game , now on to the new features !!Calibre changing -This is in my books the big change that bring an entire new element to the game , taking a young amateur flanker or centre and seeing how he develops to being a world class player on the international stage , this encourages you to play youth and go shopping for some exciting young guns on the transfer market , older players also start to loose stamina and calibre as they grow older and just adds so much to the game .New match engine - The new match engine offers so much more than the previous version , being able to select where and how to kick , that option of pressing spacebar to make a quick cross kick to your winger or a grubber into the corner it all keeps you on your toes and keeps the excitement going .The editor - Being able to move players around between clubs and removing them , I also like to look and feel of the editor International management - Now you cannot just go and coach any big team , you need to earn it by winning some trophies and I love this .There is much more new features but these are the ones that stand out for me , I said on the last game that the next version will be the make or break one and well Alternative software you have certainly stepped up and made us a bloody awesome rugby game !!! I am sure that this will not be the last RUTM and that in 10 years you will still be releasing RUTM on a yearly basis. 8 / 10			"

												I've just requested a refund for this game. Here's why...Took several attempts to run in the first instance (only did so on ""Simple"" graphics quality)When watching game players will frequently all gather around a ball and just circle it. Because the ball never goes out of touch when they do this, the game never ends. Only way it to restart the match.Awful, I mean truly awful menus, user interface, and lacking any sort of visual quality. Nothing has been thought though and I suspect the testing of this product was minimal.The only positive I can find is that this game actually does use real play names, league names etc and not just made up ones. It makes it enjoyable for the true rugby fan- but only up to a point. I'm life long rugby supporter and have been waiting for this release, but honestly it is atrocious! A real shame. :(			"

												An extremely disappointing and frustrating game. I'm no stranger to sport mangement sims and certainly no stranger to this game in all of its previous incarnations. I can't get anywhere with this. 15 games into my first season as the Exeter Chiefs and I haven't won a single game, lost all my pre-season friendlies and now I can't even score let alone win. I'm not missing anything, I'm training my players, I have a squad containing world class players, I've tried changing just about every tactic out of desperation, I've even tried auto-manage, but whatever I do I can't get anywhere. I've become so frustrated with this game I've given up and I won't be playing it again. Aside from that, there are numerous bugs to contend with, like the stupid dance that some of the players appear to do on the pitch, players rucking against thin air, players and ball moving from the try line to the sidelines as if an invisible hand has just picked them up and dumped them there. For the price of this game I was expecting a lot more but this is crap and I want my money back. A fiver, I wouldn't pay any more than that it's not worth it.			"

												Currently an absolute disgrace. Playing in 2D or 3D mode kept on ending with conversions not being taken and the game cannot progress. Simulation doesn't seem to account for the players abilities as the results were unrealistic to say the least. Menus are unresponsive and blurry. I can only say currently AVOID at all costs, I wouldn't be happy to have wasted my time on this if it was free.			"

												Great game, the simulation has gotten better with some of the fixes.Still a couple bugs, modding is very easy but i think the modding might have created some bugs.They have been great at receiving feedback and interacting with users online.			"

												Terrible. Trying to be football manager and failing spectacularly. I purchased this game last night and started playing it straight away. I was excited for the first Rugby manager game I've ever played. Overall I was very disappointed with the game play. It was not intuative and rather clunky. I played one game in 3D and thought it was complete rubbish the 3D animation was awful and the flow of the game was terrible. It was difficult to pick the team as it let you select the players but it was not obvious that you had picked you match day 23 as you could easily deselect someone and not realise. As a rugby fan I'm hugely disappointed by this game and will have to make do with football manager until a decent rugby manager game comes out...			"

												EDIT: Just to make this clear - I have only played the game for less than an hour and it wasn't for me. The screenshots are representative of the gameplay, so take a look at those and make you own judgement. If you can get past how the match engine looks then there is a lot of depth to the game, even from my short experience.I really can't reccomend this game as it stands - I'm a massive rugby fan and have been waiting for ages for someone to create a compelling experience like Football Manager for rugby.I'm not expecting the best graphics ever, but it should at least look vaguely like rugby. The scrums are just a mass of players in the same place. I can forgive the errors in the database (numerous spelling errors, positional errors and main squad players i've never even heard of for my team Newcastle Falcons) but if you're charging £25 I'd expect the engine to look better than the original Pro Rugby Union Manager which came out in something like 2005.I know it's not all about graphics, but there needs to be some form of immersion created by the depiction of the games.I really wanted this game to be great, but couldn't get past the problems with the match engine (including a bug that caused me to restart the game when all the players on the pitch were running round the ball but no one would pick it up)			"

												bought game, but it would not work on my laptop. Well over spec for the game, but it would not run. asked steam for a refund but they felt i had played the game for more that two hours. imposible. so teh team at Alternative software spent two weeks trying to fix it. but not being anle to find a solution they have refunded me my money. I woud say purchase their software but avoid using steam if possible. so trying to get help out of steam customer ""lack of"" support was like trying to get blood out of a stone.			"

												Really poor game. Graphics are very basic, menu system is limited. Gameplay is very poor.Overall this is certainly not a game worth paying for. In fact, if it was free I don't think it would have long term appeal either.Great shame, as I really wanted a quality rugby management game.			"
