Early Access Review
								(EDIT: Recent changes seem to have made ZP a much more enjoyable game, with much less frustration and much longer games. Thank you, DEVs.) One presumes that most gamers interested in pinball have some degree of experience, so this review focuses on what makes Zaccaria Pinball what it is, and specific information on each table posted seperately. What all potential players DO need to be aware of is that these tables were produced 30 to 40 years ago as physical pinball tables by Italian designers, so few of them have been seen before in North America. This review will hopefully receive revising as needed.(A listing of far more information, as well as details on each and every individual table, will be posted on the Zaccaria Pinball discussion page. Hopefully, pretty much most of what people will need at this stage may be found there. This is only a small portion of it here. Thank you.)http://steamcommunity.com/app/444930/discussions/0/358415206080779382/http://steamcommunity.com/app/444930/discussions/0/358415206080766569/ZACCARIA PINBALL – CHANGES TODAY’S PLAYERS SHOULD TAKE NOTE OFLane Lights/NudgingAll of the Zaccaria Pinball tables came right at the cusp of the “flipper-changed lane lights” era, so none of them have this (now) long standard feature. This absence strongly changes the dynamic of the game, requiring the ball to traverse lanes far more times (for the average player), requiring more aiming skill and a different strategy. But overall, older tables will generally require increased skill.One aspect of the increased skill, as well as the lack of control over lane lights, is an increased benefit to nudging. This player is required by circumstance to play one-handed, with a controller. As it is far more difficult to accomplish substantially more actions with what amounts to just two fingers, I am unable to specifically comment on the effect, need, use, or advantages to nudging in Zaccaria Pinball. Others will be more qualified, and no doubt will be anxious to help. It should be safe to say that nudging is substantially more crucial in Zaccaria Pinball than in newer tables, or tables that originated in digital form.Sound EffectsThe original Zaccaria Pinball tables came at a time when sound was finding a more significant place in pinball. As such, even ZP tables that might be expected to have great sound, such as circus or military themed tables, may have almost no sound at all. And the several tables that bravely use voice acting may present largely unintelligible phrases. But a few of the later tables really do have great sound effects, and considering historical context, weak sound should not be considered a negative.The Dreaded OutlaneNow for Zaccaria Pinball’s dark little secret. Numerous tables present a strong argument of having been specifically designed to feed balls into outlanes. Many, or most (or all) players will have games where every ball leaves through an outlane, never having been touched by flipper. And they will be on the same tables. (This reviewer had one table quickly direct nine out of nine balls to outlanes during testing. But this extreme case may certainly be an anomaly.) Seeing the ball “ladder” up the slingshots into an outlane is one of the most distressing actions in pinball…and in Zaccaria Pinball is far from rare on several tables. Experienced players will see all the design elements, such as lowered outlane barriers and slingshot strength and angles, which encourage gravity to consistently act contrary to the design of a long-play table (and the wishes of many players.) Safe to say, identifying those tables by name is neither prudent nor necessary, but they are the minority and they do not attempt to hide. Please keep in mind that these tables were designed to be coin operated, so games of extreme length were not always in the best financial interest.CamerasWhile Zaccaria Pinball has wonderful control over camera views, there may still be some issues to be considered. This reviewer has been playing computer pinball in portrait mode exclusively for well over a year, and Zaccaria Pinball makes this incredibly easy. Simply set your monitor to portrait view through Windows, Zaccaria Pinball takes care of everything else instantly and automatically. But what this player found on two i7, Windows 10 laptops is that by using any of the seven default ZP camera views, left and right edges of all table were lost to the degree that outlanes weren’t even a trace on the screen, much less the outlane flippers that can be so vital. But the problem may be the solution: camera options.It appears that Cameras 1 -3 may be fixed, but 4 – 7 are easily modifiable. Since option changes appear onscreen as they’re chosen, select the camera in that four camera range that shows the view you prefer. Then change the FOV (field of view) setting to something around 60%. This should allow you to see the entire table, and further tweaking may provide even better results. (This basically emulates Fly Cam, which, if one might think adequate to SHOW the table, would be adequate to PLAY the table.)Options!!!	It may be safe to unequivocally state that there has NEVER been a pinball game that allowed the player such a remarkable degree of control. There are far too many selections to go into in detail, but the scope should be indicated. For example, this player likes to play Zaccaria Pinball with the background sounds of a tropical island, playing in the early evening during a thunderstorm on a tables that looks as if they’ve been played for many years and not cleaned (much like this player, in fact.) So that’s EXACTLY what I do. Or a more urban player may wish to play as if in an arcade (the default) or an airport, on a brand new, spotlessly clean table, sunny mid-afternoon. Players may change the ball to granite or glass. Or make the sound of the rolling ball or flipper strike louder or quieter. Changes can also be made to physics, but unless you have selected USER as game mode, they will have no effect. USER mode has its own leaderboard, but this player’s single experience was that the leaderboard wasn’t populated. (What would be the point of a leaderboard of miscellaneous and widely varied laws of physics? A 1% slant generated score compared to a 99% slant generated score?)Experiment with options. It adds variety, and it’s fun to see the capabilities (and in the case of Camera, players may have little choice.)TOP DOZEN ZACCARIA PINBALL TABLES (in one opinion)BlackbeltCircusDevil RidersEarth Wind FireFarfallaHot WheelsMagic CastleMexico '86Soccer KingsSpace ShuttleStrikeTime MachineNOT-TOP DOZEN ZACCARIA PINBALL TABLES (in one opinion)Cine StarFire MountainLucky FruitMoon FlightMystic StarNautilusRed ShowStar GodStar's PhoenixSupersonicUniverseWood's QueenThank you			"

Early Access Review
								Speaking as a pinball table owner, I can say Zaccaria Pinball is quite an accurate simulation, although not absolutely perfect. Some aspects of the physics of the tables are being adjusted on an ongoing basis during early access, but the game is already in a state that I would say is virtually complete. The tables themselves are authentic tables manufactured by Zaccaria, an Italian company which existed between 1974 and 1988. On first sight they don't match up visually to later tables, particularly those of U.S. manufacturers who often market their tables with tie-ins from Hollywood movies. However, the Zaccaria tables do have a beauty of their own. Their characteristic style is representative of the popular cartoon art of the era in which they were made. Being quite old, the tables have fewer toys, ramps and rails on the play surface than you would typically find on tables from the late 1980s onwards. They also lack the l.e.d. display fields and more complicated rule-sets typical of later tables.For anyone too young to have encountered these tables for real, Zaccaria Pinball (the video game) is offering the experience of playing historically accurate and still highly enjoyable pinball tables on your computer (or other device), which is practically the only way these days.In terms of playability, these older types of tables can be less forgiving, and due to the simpler rule-sets, the games aren't as engrossing as many you find in Farsight Studios' The Pinball Arcade. However, you have exactly the same issue with the older electro-mechanical and early solid-state tables in The Pinball Arcade.Pixel Magic, the makers of Zaccaria Pinball (the video game) have done a superb job of rendering the game and it looks amazing. The only exception is the back glass, which looks a bit strange close up. The under-surface lighting, reflections from the table glass, and even optional fingerprints and scratches help to create the illusion of playing something well used and real. While it might not provide quite the buzz of some other contemporary pinball video games, it achieves a higher degree of authenticity and is still still very enjoyable. I have no hesitation in recommending Zaccaria Pinball.			"

								At the time of review, I cannot even describe how amazingly well done this game is. Magic Pixel does a way better job at getting fixes in even before the game released out to the public!Try it before you buy it; the game comes with Time Machine for free, and everything else you'll have to pay for (free with a score limit; similar to what Pinball Arcade does). Heck, get Gold Membership and save a huge chunk of DLC.			"

								+++ Gold Membership Review +++[+] pro:+ Superb simulation of (relatively) obscure historic pinball machines from Italy. +/- Late electro-mechanical and early solid state area (ca. mid 1970's - mid 1980's)      The SS area machines are only the very beginnings ->      so,  that means simple rules but hard mechanics by comparison to 1990s and later pinball      machines !!! - more pure flipper pinball, less gimmicks.      If compared with Pinball Arcade, a handfull of the tables here is like Central Park / Big Shot / El Dorado and the rest maybe roughly Gorgar, Black Knight or Centaur level from the game play mechanics.     Only the last Zaccaria table from 1987 had a multiball.      No Wizard Mode or dmd games here.    Just to preserve you from disappointment. Ok.+ Pure and fast flipper gameplay. I find it very addictive. No artificialy inflated esoteric rule sets.Games are normaly very short. But that makes you always wanting 'one more try'.+ Very cool early electronic sounds. Like Flight 2000 or Firepower, but sometimes even better!+ Free customizable camera settings+ Lots of visual options starting with different ball skins to even fingerprints/scratches/brakes on the glass.+ Different ambient light settings (morning, afternoon, midnight etc.)+ Arcade, Simulation, User Mode (means own physics settings) each with different highscore tables.+ highly customizable physic settings for the User Mode+ additional game modes (have not testet yet)+ Extra 'pillory' highscore table for cheaters !!! (lol)[-]  con (not really):To blate on high niveau:- Only negative I found is that till now one can not change to vertical screen orientation for portrait mode in game, but has to use the nvidia/whatever GPU controll panel.[] Conclusion:VERY recommended.Must buy for every pinball connoisseur/collector.Pinball newbies should download this one, Pinball FX2 and Pinball Arcade for free and spend some time with the free tables and THEN decide what suits them best.Virtual Pinball Simulation Olymp is Pro Pinball Ultra Timshock!. (thats like to own a real table, arguably even better)Only next stage would be to buy a real pinball machine for thousands of $€$.			"

								FOR NON-PINBALL PLAYERS:Pinball is something that requires being willing to dive deep into the depths of game/physics mechanics. If you play a table and think ""all pinball is the same"" or ""you just whack balls around"", you don't get it... yet. You should give it an honest try before judging, because pinball will blow your mind if you give it a chance. Have a friend explain it, or watch some videos about the magic that is...P I N B A L LFOR PINBALL VETS:Zaccaria supplies some European recreations that most of the American pinball audience has never seen. They're primarily in the EM/SS eras, are absolutely brutal, but always make you want to play just ooooone more game. Can't say I'd ever pop quarters into these machines (too brutal for my skills), but digitally: I'm hooked!Things to NOT expect:- Fancy DMDs (not including ""remixed"" tables)- Crazy lightshows- Complex rulesets/missions (not including ""remixed"" tables)- Music (for the most part, and not including ""remixed"" tables)Things TO expect:- Fantastic and rarely experienced EM/SS table recreations- Incredibly hard-yet-satisfying flows- A much higher (and thus more satisfying) learning curve than standard American tables- Being forced to become a master of your flippers and ball... there are no random flipping points to be had hereUNIQUE Pros:- !!!! COMPLETE CUSTOMIZATION (camera, lights, physics, reflections, table dirt/scratches, etc)... THE #1 pro to this suite !!!- Custom ""Extra Game"" modes/challenges not available on the original tables- The best graphics outside of pre-rendered applications (Pro Pinball Ultra)- ""Remixed"" tables that turn the old school EM/SS tables into DMD era titles- A *ton* of achievementsIf you play TPA: this has the customization you've been wanting and could only get from 3rd party sources (because Stern is too afraid of letting digital be an interactive catalogue or ""lower class"" market, the fools)If you play FX2: this has the non-IP-oriented tables and environment customization you've been cravingWhat's missing (at the moment)?- True pincab support (seemingly on the docket, but we'll see). The game works fine on my pincab, buuuut you won't utilize multiple monitors or a DMD. Still, *fantastic* to play on my full-scale pincab... it can only get better from here :)- Plenty of wishlist items, but as-is it's something I have chosen to play far more often than the other suites			"

								If you are not familiar with Zaccaria Pinball when it was released as an app, this is one of the best compilations of online pinball currently available.  It has feature settings to be able to adjust all major functions and options, FAR exceeding those of Farsight Studiios, Pinball Arcade, MicroSoft Pinball Arcade, Pro Pinball, and other games of the past.  For historical reference, Zaccaria was a pinball company from Italy in the 1970s and 80s, and made a multitude of creative tables that unfortunate for most, have been lost to time.  Many titles were extremely low production, such as ""Spooky"" which only 60 were made.  The game collection is more respective to a proper simulation on par with TimeShock!  The best part?  Pick the tables you want to own, and try them all.  You will not be disappointed.  It seems that the only way this game can go is UP from its current state of development, as it is already very polished, in its translition from the mobile world.The ball physics and game optimization needs tweaking right now, that point is clear.The game engine is ""stalling"" even on high end systems.My credentials for recommendation of this game are simple.  I am a pinball collector and historian, and have been so for 27 years, owning well over 650+ game, many Zaccaria titles, and still have a robust collection spanning from 1972-2013.  The respresentation of Zaccaria games is accurate, with the exception of some of the animated backglasses that are not depicted.For example, ""Spooky"" has animated ""Tootsie Roll Mr. Owl"" eyes that move back and forth in the backglass on the real game and are missing on the simulation.Let's see the comparative review listed right now...only words listed, ""Score Limit"".Extremely ""insightful"".Games are not free to make, except in the world of fruitcake cluster$#@! uneducated jack wagons millenlials that believe that they are entitled to something for NOTHING.

								I've been playing computer pinball simulations since David's Midnight Magic and Pinball Construction Set on my Commodore 64. Bought just about anything that claims to be pinball, including a few truly execrable titles. This is definitely among the best. The improvements and responsiveness of the developers to constructive criticism and bug reports has been quite gratifying. If you like pinball at all, consider buying the whole Gold Membership DLC. There's a tremendous value there and the achievement implementation is quite compelling, with novel modes such as Lamp Hunter and 90-second challenges. Some less-happy reviews have been frustrated that some of the customization options are available only through DLC (Bronze Membership). Just go ahead and get the Gold membership which has both the first 30+ tables and the customization options. If you're used to the more modern, deep-rule games seen in simulations such as Pinball Arcade, you'll need to take a bit of time to get used to these. Some table designs are repetitive, but once you get tuned in to the table, the subtle differences really make you think about how you're controlling the ball.  And if you prefer Pinball FX to Pinball Arcade, you might not like these tables at all. The Zaccaria tables are an older style with limited programming and very few novelties. Some ramps, second playfields; multiball is rare. The one modern remake table released so far (Shooting the Rapids 2016) is a strong first effort and is a good demo for the potential of their engine. It's not up to the standard of a table that you might get from a Stern, but it's definitely more than a re-skin, with interesting added features including a rotating bagatelle (on which the ball often gets stuck, so learn to nudge gently).

								Review of early access paid version with all tables.Fans of 70s and 80s pinball are gonna love this.Great physics, beautifully recreated tables, and huge configurability from Devs who engage with the community and respond quickly to requests and bug reports.'Early access' but it's already in a fully playable and polished state, a few minor bugs still present if you look hard but the devs are fixing those and adding improvements fast.The nudge system could do with a little work and the slingshot triggers are too sensitive, but other than that I can't think of any negatives for this wonderful simulation.Try it, then buy it all.

								This may be the closest thing to real tables, very authentic pinball. Love it!For an in depth review check out the other reviews of the more 'pro' players. I am not even going to attempt to write a detailed review as I am a casual pinball player (I just wanted to give a thumbs up) :)As a casual player that is used to Zen's FX2 these original tables are much much harder (simulation mode). There are a few tables that are more forgiving, but a lot of the tables can already drain a ball before you even had the chance to use the flippers, nudging is mandatory. Luckily you can buy single tables that you like as dlc's and skip the ones that are bit to frustrating :) Thumbs up!Small edit: You can also play on 'arcade mode' which is a lot less extreme when it it comes to the ball bouncing of the bumpers and slingshots (much less drains than in simulation mode) and you can customize the table difficulty to your liking!

								First off, this is very much like Pinball FX2. The exception is these tables are like they would appear in real life, and some are actual reproductions of real life pinball machines. These machines are much older than the more modern ones that appear on Pinball Fx2. Im pretty positive in fact ive played some of these at a arcade in the 1980's before.As for control, it uses my logitech F310 controller as the flippers for it. It works pretty good with this controller. Be aware that i personally have had issues with the right flipper getting stuck sometimes, as on pinball fx2 too causing this also, so it might be just be my personal controller causing it.As for the game, it is pretty good. I recommend it to pinball enthusiasts that enjoy pinball old school style.UPDATED: this game works fine with no controller issues with a XBOX 360 PC controller.			"

								This was a real surprise to me when this showed up and I was curious to see how well the machines would look and play. When the gold package was available for only $5 more, I decided to add it to my growing collection of simulated pin tables. I've been playing pins for over 55 years and have 10 real pins in my collection. I was very delighted to find that the program sports a huge amount of customization and display resolutions. I play my sim pins in 2160P and portrait mode and these tables work great along with my xbox 360 wireless controller. These pins tend to be old school designs but capture the period very well with beautiful artwork and lighting. The designers did a great job of providing an almost unlimited amount of customization from arcade to real sim settings. Job very well done.			"

								I love pinball (real and video game).  I snatched this up as soon as I saw it.  I like all of the customazation features that this game offers but getting the proper camera angle for my taste was really nice.Then I started trying out all of the tables and was disappointed.  They are too freaking hard.  Then I realized I suck and just need to get better.  This is what pinball was always meant to be.  Hard, frustrating, and requiring proper use of nudging to keep ball in play but also very rewarding when you have a great game.I also like that these tables are fairly simple.  A lot of the newer pins are too complex and over the top gimmicky for me.			"

Early Access Review
								If you like pinball but want to play something with a lil' different feel and look than the Bally, Williams, or Gottlieb games then Zaccaria Pinball might be what you're looking for.These games are generally much simpler than pins from other manufacturers, especially compared to what was being put out in the 80's and 90's by Bally, Williams, and Gottlieb, but that is just part of what makes them fun and enjoyable.  You can figure out what you have to do with any of these pins to ramp points quickly and then its all about getting the ball to do what you want to make it happen.The striking art, unusual layouts, and quirky sound effects somehow all come together to make these pins great.  At the time of this review the game is in Early Access status so maybe its a good idea to wait a bit while they finish tweaking things.  But so far the devs seem to be doing a great job at it (4 updates in just a few days!) and do respond from time to time in the forum to player's comments so I decided to give it a shot and buy in anyways.I play Pinball Arcade quite a bit and in comparison so far the game feels essentially complete to me.  Stability is actually better than Pinball Arcade at the moment!  (Farsight just did a update a day or so ago that changes the menus and some other things and now Pinball Arcade locks up on me fairly regularly  :/  )  Only real issues IMO right now is the ball physics (I think it needs to be heavier to be more realistic), ball-on-flipper handling (ball suddenly ""acts"" heavier when it touches a flipper), and speed on the playfield (too fast right now!  especially for their 70's era EM machines) and some other minor tweaks like slingshot sensitivity.  There are options in the menus to tweak some stuff to help there already but I just can't seem to get it right with them.  They do help though so things are hardly bad at all with the way the game plays right now either at default or with tweaked settings.  I'm sure they'll get worked out over time.  Or at least the devs will give users the option to tweak those things in a menu.  They already let you tweak almost everything else!  The sheer amount of adjustments you can make to the game are impressive and are an area where Zaccaria really has a leg up on Pinball Arcade already.  The way the menus are set up is also better too IMO, even after Pinball Arcade's recent update (though I will say PA's new menus are a step in the right direction).  They're very clear and intuitive to  use.  All in all I think for pinball enthusiasts this game is nearly a must buy.  Its nearly impossible to even find a Zaccaria pins in the real world anymore and typically they're in sad condition.  This game gives you the chance to play ALL of them in proper working order the way they should be played!If you're not much into pinball or have never tried it I think this game is still worth give it a go:  it is free to play 1 of the tables so you can see if its for you.  They're quick playing games that are easy to learn but hard to master and whimsical themes really lend themselves well to some casual gaming styles.  Give it a shot, you'll probably like it!Other info:  I bought the Gold version of this game with all the tables for about $40 which seems like the best deal overall since it had all the games.  I think there are some settings the Gold version has that the free version don't but none of them really are needed.  Its stuff like changing the ball materials and flipper colors according to the store page description.  Nice to have but IMO its more for enthusiasts who like to tweak everything just so.			"

								Simply put, this game is boss.Let's be honest here, every pinball collection on Steam has its flaws. Pinball FX has neat tables, but they're all fantasy tables that could never exist in real life and rely heavily on achieving table goals for enjoyment. The Pinball Arcade is full of real tables, but focuses on the more bombastic American releases, providing a lot of eye candy and fun tables but not a great overview of the basics and development of pinball over the years (something most collections suffer.) Most other collections are not only significantly smaller, but often feature less than inspired table designs or janky physics.Enter Zaccaria Pinball.I've never seen any of these tables in real life. I've never HEARD of any of them. I've never heard anyone so much as mention the company. These are not the most complicated tables you'll play, or the most unique in gameplay, but what they lack in those areas they make up for in presenting an excellent picture of the evolution of solid state pinball tables and provide arguably a more authentic ""classic"" pinball experience than the more complex (and, admittedly, arguably more important) titles featured in The Pinball Arcade.The artwork on these tables -- and in the game in general -- is gorgeous, a fantastic fusion of 70s/80s neon and graphic design with modern computing power. Tables even offer the option to provide dirt and aging to their surfaces, letting you recreate the feel of an older system rather than the prisitine look of a brand new table. The physics, as well, offer a great amount of options, allowing you to customize the feel to be more TPA or more FX2 depending on your preferences, and overall the collection feels great. Tables feature little in the way of music, but mechanics and sound effects sound great, and the horrible digitized speech you just KNOW matches the original samples only adds to the flavor.Interface is a mixxed bag, with an obvious leaning toward touch screen optimization on menus and large, unwieldy icons in place of what could have been far more elegant lists and drop-down menus, but it's usable, and feels better to navigate than the new TPA interface at least, if about equally unattractive.In short, Zaccaria is a great pinball game. The 80$ price tag feels a bit high, but at 2.00 a table it's cheaper than or on par with offerings from the game's nearest competitors, and at 1/2 off for the gold pack it's a steal.			"

								Zaccaria Pinball is one of the best pinball games and it's got an awesome number of tables! It's so addictive, and the ball travels and bounces exactly as it should, and the tables are coloful and striking without distracting from the ball. For me, what's great about this game is that they are exact reproductions of real-life pinball tables, like the ""The Pinball Arcade"".In this game, you hit a ball up with flippers, and keep it bouncing around a play area to score points and there are special shots you can try to do to score bigger points.I and my brother worked after school and on weekends in order to earn the pocket money to get these virtual tables onto Daddy's computer, and it's such a lot of fun! If you like pinball, you'll love this game, and if you don't like pinball, then Zaccaria is the game which will change your mind!			"

								These pinball machines have a wonderfully weird, sleazy, dirty, funky edge to them... like faded memories of arcades from childhoods in an alternate universe.As a huge pinball fan in NJ since the early 80s, and an emulation and Pinball Arcade fanatic in recent years, the Zaccharia tables are an absolute joy to get to know, since I'm so unfamiliar with them. In all my travels, I don't think I saw or played a single one in the real world, and encountered just a few in emulation.All these games are fantastic, and the execution here is top notch. I expect to be playing this for many years.I strongly recommend getting the Gold Collection, with all the tables, as the variety of games is part of what makes it so great.On the downside, the interface is a bit clunky, but I've gotten used to it. Also, there are a LOT of options, which is good - but it did take me awhile to get everything set the way I like it. I think I still need to fine tune the cameras some more.Bottom line, if you're a pinball fan, you need to get this. There's something very special about this collection. "

								Zaccaria Pinball in two words, freaking, wonderful. If you want a pinball game download this one, and it's FREE![PROS]+Amazing Atmopshere. You are in a room possibly in a penthouse with people talking back and fourth, it feels great!+Sounds. When Magic Pixel was making this game, I bet sound (right behind graphics) was there most important choice. The sounds in this game are FANTASTIC! I'm serious! From the coin clicking in the coin door, to sounds from the machine, it sounds so real. It really makes you feel that you are playing the real machine+GREAT GRAPHICS! Reflections, lighting, shadows and the pinball playfield looks SO GOOD! It gives it that ""real factor."" You can play the machines at night, and it makes the playfield light up with all of it's bright lights. If you look at the images that this game provides, you will be shocked! To get these graphics, you must have a good lookin moniter.+70s to 80s pinball selection. There is a lot of pinball tables to select from, but you can only get one for free. Anyway, if you are a fan of 70s to 80s pinball, be sure to play this, EM to SS, this game has it all. There isn't any 90's pinball tables on this game, so don't get excited if you enjoy those![CONS]*Note - Some of these points may not mean they're cons to you.- One free table, the rest you have to pay in packs. You get one free table, and the rest of the tables cost money. Not, you can still play the ones that cost money, but you get a score limitation. Usually that limit is low, meaning you can't play a lot of pinball on the certain table.-These are Italian Pinball tables, not American. If you are a fan of Bally, Williams, Stern, Gottlieb, etc., you may not like this game. This game is focused around Zaccaria Pinball tables, not any others. I am a fan of Bally, and I still love this game! If you are looking for American tables play, Pinball Arcade.Overall, if you love pinball, PLAY THIS GAME! Even though you may not of heard about these tables, they are fun.			"

								i have previously owned a Farfalla pinball machine some years ago and i just want to let the developers knowhow happy i am to see this simulation. it's physics is just the same as the real table, and when i play it, i get to remember how it was. i haven't played any other real zac tables, so i can't compare them to their respective simulations   i really love the artwork and atmopshere that is presented with this collection, and can't stress enough how close they have reproduced especially Farfalla. Only thing missing that i have noticed is that the pink move ramp drop targets are not displayed correctly.    So a very big thank you to those that made this possible and i have no hesitations in recommending Zaccaria Pinball      to anyone   best regards:)  "

								Already a top flight game and it just keeps getting better! The Gold pack is the only way to go if you enjoy pinball. The pinball machines have been recreated in suprising detail. There are many options for lighting, sound, physics and any other thing you might want to change. The different game modes and extensive achievements to complete gives this game tons of replay value. The developers have been consistantly updating the game and are active on the Steam forum, showing they listen to what players want by fixing bugs and adding content based on suggestions. Easily the best digital pinball experiance for the money, I highly recommend this game!			"

								I haven't played with a lot of pinball games since WinXP was installed onto my device, but I tried this gem the other day. I have and AMD HD7850 (midrange card) and the game looks beautiful with every effect, the gameplay is still smooth with them turned on, the physics are realistic too... Got a little dizzy with most of the camera angles, so I used the fist one. <.>I was just playing casually with ""Star God"", and it really sucked me in. For me it brought back my childhood and I can strongly recommend it. 2$ for a level isn't even bad either if you can stick with each for a few hours. Thumbs up for the DEVs. :)			"

								Zaccaria Pinball is a ""Free to Play"" Pinball table simulator game.  It worked, looked good, sounded good, played ok.  Has serveral control modes, high score leaderboards, achievements.  Playing by mouse is not recommended. You get free access to the Time Machine table with 1 ball and 2 players and the rest of the buyable tables are limited by a low score limit.  The Time Machine table has a time limit on playing the bonus 4 ball by credits, you can earn credits on scoring the table but if you run out of credits, your flippers stop.  I put a link to video of a real Time Machine table.  Try it, you might like it.For more info:Review.

								TL/DR version:  If you enjoy older pinball tables then this is a buy.  Game physics feel good and controls feel snappy and responsive.  Where this is notably different than other pinball simulators is the in-game table presentation can be tweaked; lighting effects are fantastic and offer substantial options for customization and camera positioning can be finely tuned as well. I particularly enjoyed the option to enable wear on the playfield which gives the table the look of a 30+ year old pinball table that's seen some serious use over the years.			"

								Let me start by saying I use this game solely on the Oculus Rift, which I recently got (without touch for now).  The VR implementation is very nice.  Also, if you buy the bronze pack, you get a crap ton of options for effects and settings on all the tables.  Almost all of the tables are old school and unforgiving, made by one company (Zaccaria) thats not Bally or Williams.  I love that you can hear the ball rolling on the table...also a setting for that.  The lack of themes like movies, shows, etc is pretty apparent and the themes are fairly generic.  If pinball arcade ever does VR I'm all in, those tables are much more personal for me.  If you get the 10$ VR its for all the tables....so for all the tables and VR and Bronze...whoopty do package on sale I think it was 40-50 bucks or something like that.  In my opinion, worth it.  There are two 2016 tables that are not included in their packs though....good tables too, 3 bucks each.  Again, worth it.  The game has the most achievements I have ever seen, which is awesome for a pinball game.  It is also loaded with different modes like lamp hunter, etc, that I will probably never even get to on every table.			"

								If you are into pinball then take the plunge. I bought the gold package because as far as I'm concerned you can never have ""too many"" pinball tables. Pinball was the first thing as far as games are concerned that I played as a teen (showing my age there.) Pinball always took whatever consumable income I had.I have never seen any of these tables in real life, but as some people have mentioned in other reviews, these were European tables. I would label these tables as ""quarter munch-ers"". If I were in a bar & was getting in my pinball fix, I would have only played them for a game or two because of how fast the balls drain & it's game over. Considering the fact that you no longer have to keep feeding these games quarters to continue playing, that factor no longer applies. These tables will certainly make you refine your play style. If I were to compare these tables to Pinball FX, I would say that these tables are more realistic, there are no fancy animations, no bells & whistles, just hard core pinball. With the gold package you can adjust the tables in any manner you choose, which is a definite plus in my book. This does have a minor downside though, it takes a while to figure out what to change before you have the tables set up to your liking. Since the entire catalog of Zaccaria tables is not represented here, it leaves open the possibility of seeing additional tables in the future.I'll admit I'm a pinball junkie, but if you are like me, go for it. It will be money well spent. I now have another timesink to enjoy for quite some time! The replayability of these tables is endless.Rating: 15 out of 10!			"

								Zaccaria Pinball seems like a pretty great pinball game. Its got a ton of different tables right out of the gate, but with free limitations on them. Most can be purchased as DLC, that may be a big negative for many people but it is what it is. Overall I would have to say this is one of the best pinball games we have on Steam, if not because of the more than decent quality, then because there are just a very small amount of them on Steam to begin with.

								Zaccaria Pinball is a nice additions to anyone's collections of digital pinball.  This game has a wide assortment of various pinballs put out by the company and each one has a varied play and style.  I thoroughly enjoy getting to play these  games on a personal level.  I never had the chance to play ANY of them as a kid, but was foturnate enough to play one in life just this year (7/31/2016) Time Machine st a play in Lyons, Colorado called amazingly enough Lyons Pinball, a very imaginative pinball indeed, with quite an array of things to figure out to get a rocking score, still working at your monster score Chewy!  The phyics seem fairly solid and the game play is fairly fluid.  I had no problems playing this on a AMD Phenom with at  AMD Radeon HD 4500, and it played the same as it does on my i7 4.0 GHz with at Nvidia GTX 1070, so presuming somone wished to play and enjoy the game, this game will work for you. I like the fact that the development team at also pinball players and work to make the games play just as they do in real life. I like the fact as well that they often involve the community in the development as well.  The pricing on this may stand in the way of many gamers, but let me tell you, piece it together, it makes it more enjoyable getting it a bit at a time and figuring out the machiens as you go.The VR version will get a separate review as I still have not played it yet, hope to in th next day or so.  Also a further recommendation, seek out the Community Hub, lots os great players that are more than willing to share views and opinions. Digital Pinball on Steam has a very good community of mostly friendly gamers who love to talk pinball and direct you to any resources you may need. "

I played Pac-man, and all of the other popular video games clear up until this day.Looks and sounds cool.I wish they had an ""arcade room"" mode where you could stack a few tables next to you for the ambience... also maybe some other ambient arcade noises from the era would be cool too.Nice of the company to share this.

								(Edit: I just found the options menu. This is the real game right here! So many optionnnnns!)INCREDIBLY polished pinball game. The free pinball one doesn't have any BGM, but the others do. It has full controller support, and it works well. The sound effects aren't obtrusive, and the lighting effects are subdued for a pinball game. The free camera mode is nice, and the models aren't pixelated. The different game modes are fun, and vary the gameplay a bit. Only put-off for me is the multitude of achievements. For a 100% achievement hunter, this would be a time sink. An impressive one, but still.			"

								Zaccaria Pinball is listed as Free to Play, which in reality is basically you getting the Time Machine table free and demo access to the rest of the tables. Time Machine is a pretty good table. Other tables I like in the collection are House of Diamonds, Strike and Soccer Kings. The tables are from the 1970s and 1980s so they mostly have a vintage feel. Most tables don't have any multiball. If you're like me and like playing The Pinball Arcade, you'll probably enjoy playing most of these tables as well as long as you don't mind the older design sense and lack of later innovations like ball locks, outlane kickbacks, ball saver and subtables. At the time of this review, the game is 50% off with the early access discount so the Silver Membership bundle gets you all 36 tables for about $1.00 each. The physics are pretty nice. Once in a while I'll have a ball physics hiccup but it's uncommon and minor. I guess that's partly why it's Early Access. They've been pretty good at updates and fixes so far.			"

								Only played a couple hours in VR but can already see its a fantastic translation to VR.Scale is fantastic, I really love that the motion controllers can be used for plunging nudging and flippers if you wish or you can use a traditional controller and keyboards.(Pincab controllers work too)Graphicly Its probably the best PinBall simulator out there,In VR it doesn't feel like the visuals have been pulled back at all. Set to have subtle reflections and realist light glow effects its a startling real experiance.If you enjoy 70's and 80's style Pinball this is a no brainer. 15 dollars to add VR to all existing 38 and all future tables is a great deal. Plus its got infinate replayablility unlike alot of the experirmental EA VR games we have on SteamVR currently.Definately a AAA quality product I can't wait to see some of the original tables inspired by the originals they release.For any Vive owners looking for something different to have fun with They can't go Wrong with Zaccaria's Pinball.

								The UI, table design, sound, graphics, and controls are all really great if not better than the competition. The developers are also very active, it doesn't take up too much disk space and the price is nice.The physics are still a work in progress. As it stands, I would take the floaty, way-to-easy-to-shoot-the-ball-into-ramps physics of Pinball Arcade over what Zaccaria offers.The remake tables are a tad dull too; they just don't feel like real machines, let alone recreations of past machines. But, since they're a separate product from Bronze/Silver/Gold, you can just opt to not buy them.Regardless, I still recommend this game. I just wish they'd somehow fix the physics, change/add sound effects to suit the originals, and give the user the option to make electro-mechanical tables use bell tones instead of the horrible beeps.

								Unless you are into ancient pinball suggest you pass it up, although it doesn't look too bad at first i find it unplayable except for the first table. Never heard of Zaccaria, a miracle considering my age but these tables are worse than the crap Gottlieb used to produce. I guess everybody it's own thing but this royally sucksUpdate:Couldnt help myself but to try and get all these achievements, all the add-ons with various modes and challenges have made it very interesting for me, I still don't like the physics on some of the tables in sim mode but it makes for a challenge. The best thing I would say are the developers, they seem to be on top of it, comparing to Farrsight anyway. Therefore I would recommend this game now vs not when it came out			"

								A very good, very pretty recreation of some real-life tables, and now some originals and remixes of the classic tables. The physics are, for the most part, great. About as good as The Pinball Arcade if not a little better. Just be warned that right now the game is in Early Access, and unless you're a real pinhead looking for a fix you'll probably get frustrated very quickly with the constant tweaking of the graphics and physics engine.The developers seem to subscribe to the ""If it ain't broke, break it"" philosophy, so maybe for now just keep the freeplay client installed and play around with the tables until they finally ""settle"" on a finished product. I went ahead and purchased because it was worth it for me to get to play these tables with no limits, but mileage may vary.			"

It's like an antithesis to Pinball FX2 which in my opinion goes overboard with it's visual effects and unrealistic gameplay.I love the old-school feel to Zaccaria Pinball!The look of the tables are heavily inspered from pinball machines from the 70s and 80s with quite basic rules and very mechanical switches and bumpers.  I love the audio with its creaks, buzzes and clanks.Looking forward to see what'll happen as this game moves through final development.			"

								This is a really great pinball game. You get one table but at least you can try the others without being limited to how many times you can use them like other pinball games do. Plus this one is good for people who want more realistic pinball games. It also doesn't have annoying media themes like other pinball games sometimes do (for example marvel comics and such) and instead goes for original ideas which I prefer.			"

7/10 Multiball Plays(why not 10/10? Read my review below to find out why; I still do recommend this game though!)KINDA LONG SEGMENTED REVIEW, MOSTLY FEEDBACKA Brief Review From a ""Free"" User Point of ViewAs I haven't paid a cent for anything within the game, I was limited to one ""Time Machine"" table off the bat. You may think, ""Well that's no good!"" How wrong you are. I even have a plethora/miriad of tables to choose from, that allow one free play session each. So, I found myself lost ""in the zone"" with it's mid-end hardware PC support, it's crisp graphics, smooth controls, and the awesome triggers, easy UI, nostalgic pinball gaming and even the ball plunger. Though, it's not all shiny and happy for me....I would like to see a drop in price of buying new tables (i.e. instead of $1.99 USD, make each one, like, $0.99 USD) because, I'll be honest, the price for a single table, is a bit steap. But I haven't uninstalled ZP because of that one little issue *wink* or at all!What I Would Like to See Available to Free UsersI would absolutely love it if they had a weekly free table, and if you reached a high enough score or some other requirement (i.e. ""Get 3 Multiball Plays in One Game,"" or ""Hit The Left Ramp/Ball Lock 12 Times"") in order to unlock it permanently. A rewards program like that in Zaccaria Pinball would not only grab a lot of attention, but a lot of users and their clicky fingers to download it (unlike other pinball games I've tried out).Will I be Spending Money For Any More Tables?Most definitely! As I stated before, you can try each table out for free, once (sadly just that), so you can make sure you can buy one you like. I plan to delve money into this title as soon as they agree it's a good idea to either bundle them by theme at a good and decent price, or drop the price of each individual table.			"

								If you enjoy playing older-style pinball games - ones that are focused purely on scoring loads of points with a minimum of gimmicks and razzle-dazzle - you aren't going to find a better way to play than Zaccaria Pinball. While the more famous Pinball Arcade is host to all the licensed, fancy, crazy tables most people remember, Zaccaria's games are from the generation before that. Gameplay is fast, simple, and addicting. Drains are extremely frequent and sometimes seem downright unfair, due to how pinball games were designed in the 70s, but the brief nature of the games means it's very easy to get into a game and make a quick attempt at a high score, as opposed to the lengthy sessions you'd need to play a more modern machine. If you can stay in play on a Zaccaria machine for five minutes on three balls, you're doing well.What really makes this game worth my recommendation is the work that has been put into making it replayable. Quality of Life features are everywhere - a quick and easy restart, ways to sort the tables, the ability to try any table before you buy it, constant bugfixes and updates - I've been playing for less than a month and Magic Pixel has added two new game modes and two new tables in that time. Every game has TWELVE leaderboards, and with over forty games in the collection, that means you have over 480 leaderboards to compete on. The games themselves are hard and unforgiving, yes, but Magic Pixel has done everything possible to make them presentable to the modern player without actually changing them into something they aren't.If you play the free version (which includes Time Machine and free trials for all other tables except unlockables) and you enjoy it, I highly recommend the Gold Membership Bundle. It works out to just over a dollar per table, with the ability to unlock more tables, and is definitely the best value. The ""remake"" tables, sold separately from the bundles, attempt to bring Zaccaria into the modern era, which is good if you like both kinds of pinball and TPA and Zen aren't doing it for you, but are separate purchases. I can't comment on the VR DLC, because I don't use VR.In short:+ Free trial is generous and, as long as you don't touch the options, never gets pushy+ Beautiful graphics with faithfully, lovingly reproduced tables+ Fun, quick gameplay you can quickly restart if you mess up or get screwed over+ Tons of modes to play and leaderboards to compete on to increase replay value+ Updated frequently to fix bugs and add new content by developers who care (unlike Pinball Arcade which is ignoring months-old bug reports)+ Some of that new content is added for free, such as the ""Story Mode"" that went live in March 2017.+ Achievements actually mean something! You can unlock free tables by getting lots of achievements.- Having to pay for options is a little silly- The tables themselves tend to be ""drain monsters"" and some drains can be hard to swallow, so this game isn't for everyone- Unlike PBA, no background information is given about the games besides their original release date, even in the ""Story Mode"", which is more of an endurance challenge, not a story. If you want to learn about Zaccaria's history as a company, turn to Google.			"

Early Access Review
								When you updated it from the old way of the ball physics to the current one (October 2016), the older one felt MUCH more realistic than the new one. The way the ball bounces around now is way too much compared to real life Pinball. The old version of ball physics was a LOT more realistic. I hope you bring back the old ball physics, since you mentioned that it will be better, but it really isn't. I feel like there was nothing wrong with the ball physics earlier, and now you changed it to be more of a video/arcade game, and not a real life simulator. I hope you bring back the old ball physics. I understand that the game is in Early Access and all, but I'm pretty sure the old ball physics was the closest to a Pinball simulator I ever felt in any video game version of Pinball ANYWHERE! Coming from a Pinball Professional, I am telling you that changing it back to the old ball physics or making this one much more realistic will help it a lot. Thanks.			"

								This is a strange beast.  They did an awesome job simulating a pinball machine in every detail including sounds, visuals and realism, I have no problem with the simulation as a simulation and the variety of boards adds to the allure of this title.  Thumbs up on all accounts for the simulation part. Now the not so good news.... After playing every pinball machine several times I have come to this conclusion: Sure it's a great sim, but it's like a great car sim of a Yugo, who wants to drive a Yugo sim?  The pinball layouts and design are just not gamer friendly as compared with Bally for example (Bally is very polished).  Am I a great pinball wizard? no, however these poorly thought out designs are just not fun in my opinion. Summary: There are 3 or 4 of their pinball games I do like, and  even though not perfect, they are challenging and a great simulation anyways - I like a challenge and the sim is so good it makes up a bit for the poor pinball layout design/gameplay.  Great leaderboards system too. I recommend it only if you play a demo of all their games until you find the ones you like, dont' buy all of them - it would be a waste of money $$$.			"

								First off, the 3D graphics are way, way better than Pinball Arcade. Unfortunately, the tables themselves are really, really boring to play, and that includes the 2016 remake table I bought.Second, the monetization system is horrible. First I had to pay 100nok to play in VR, which placed the pinball machine in front of a well lit window. Who, in the history of pinball, has ever thought it was a good idea to play a pinball machine in front of strong, direct light? Second, when I went into the menu to change the lights, the game takes me out of VR and into a purchasing screen where it asks for me to buy a 60nok ""bronze edition"".I can't recommend this. It reeks of desperation, sadly.			"

								Update #3~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This has been a fun ride.  I've hated, loved, hated, and loved this game.  Yes, that many times.The physics in Simulation mode got changed to something I don't see as realistic at all after my Review Update #2, so I left for a while.  I came back and fixed the physics in User mode to some degree, so now I'm back in love with the game.Improvements that made me update the review are: challenge modes, and a free table that you can unlock with achievements.  (Amazing!)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Update #2Someone has been working really hard at making this the best pinball game ever.  The latest update is quite amazing and I highly recommend this game in it's present state.Almost every issue seems to have vanished and the tables are much more fun to play now than when it first entered early access.  A few tables are similar, but for the most part, they are all very different and require different strategies.It's still in early access, and the developers have been taking a lot of suggestions and working to make it more realistic and fun.  Watching my score climb up the leaderboards is my favorite new feature.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Update #1 I am recommending this title now.  It still needs work, but it's really changing into something much better than when I wrote the review.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Zaccaria Pinball is similar to ""Pinball Arcade"", ""Visual Pinball"", and ""Future Pinball"" in that it tries to recreate a real life pinball experience.  ""Zen Pinball"" is totally different.It's an Early Access title, so here's my thoughts on the development of it.The game is very stable.Some tables are frustrating, and it's clear that they were designed to munch quarters.Sounds are accurate, but many tables have no background music.Table designs released very close together in time are very similar to each other.  It's awesome for the history aspect, but it would be nice if they released a re-imagined dream version of each table along with the original.  Something like that would really seperate this title from the pinball masses.Seeing as it's Early Access, they give you a Free table, and each table as a demo, I'd say give it a try if you're a pinball fan.  If you don't care about the history or are easily frustrated, you may want to pass.  ...for now that is.I am a big pinball fan, and I almost recommend this title as is, but it is not quite there.  ...yet			"

								EDIT 24.02.17:The physic got another make-over. This time they are much better. To the point that I feel like I can actually recommend the game.The physics aren't fantastic but they are passable and if you've really got the itch for old solid state pinball you can have some fun with this.My recommendation is based on the physics improving, as I've seen in the last few weeks and that trend continuing. There's work being done at least and the devs don't just throw out table after table without caring about the gameplay. It's still not perfect but the recent updates gave me confidence.EDIT 15.02.17:The physics have been reworked. The ball is a lot more lively now and at least bounces. While having improved, because they are at least not dead boring anymore, the physics are still not what I'd call good.At least work is being done.I still can't recommend the game. The physics are still wrong for a lack of a better word.Original review:The current physics are absolutely atrocious. The ball is dead. It just doesn't bounce off of anything and on many tables will just plummet straight down whenever it hits anything that isn't the oversensitive slingshots. It feels as if the ball weighs 50 pounds and instead of rubber the boundaries are made of felt.Because the ball is completely lethargic most machines play godawful or even unfair. Never will the ball bounce to not run down an outlane because bouncing isn't something the ball in this game does. The plunger is also extremely weak and you'll have to use full force every time to just get the ball on the playfield, resulting in many drains straight down the middle. See, the ball will just thump against the stopper above and fall like a shot airplane instead of bouncing back.Have I mentioned yet that the ball doesn't bounce?You've got customization options that do jack ♥♥♥♥. If you think you can get the ball to finally bounce by pushing the slider for elasticy all the way up you're mistaken.It's a real shame too. Visually the game is nice and the custom options for lighting and such can solve all the visibility issues you might have. I like the tables too, as early solid state tables are my thing. They just all play extremely bad due to the ball physics being the worst I've ever encountered in a pinball game.I will change this review should that ever change.			"

Rating: 9.25/10Paid: NZ$0.00 (Free-To-Play)Review:Zaccaria was a company from Italy that made pinball and arcade machines from 1974 until 1988, when it suffered bankruptcy.For a free game, this is really good. The graphics are superb, I actually feel like I am playing the game in a real room, not pushing keys on my keyboard to control a 2D machine.You get a free table at the start, and then the other tables are free to play once. But I haven't played the other tables because I'm still addicted to Time Machine (the free table). The game saves your scores and places you in the world rankings. In the game, it says (without getting in the way) how many points the next person has, and if you are to have a bad round, the game only saves your best score, so it's not possible to go down in a ranking.I just have to warn you, this game is addictive. I'd swear my computer opens it and I just start playing it. I've also managed to friends and family to enjoy this, so why don't you grab that $0 that you were putting towards anything with a $0 price tag and give Zaccaria Pinball a go.And let me end this off by saying, holy sh♥t this has 720 990 1461 1635 1959 achievements!!!

								I like it. I'm a fan of computer pinball. This game reminds me of real pinball machines. I bought the gold pack and the Achievement Pack for under 50 dollars (both put together, and i even had money left on a 50 dollar steam card.). I'm not really sure what's different about the silver and the gold (maybe something about including bronze options???), but i went for the gold. The Achievement Table Pack is a great buy because it's like 7 more tables.  um... this is like real pinball machines.. i own 3 other pinball games... pinball hd, pinball fx2, and pinball arcade. now, i own Zaccaria Pinball. i always used to put my pinball initials as zzz. so when i saw this game, i was astonished. when your editor comes out, you should hold a contest to make like first, second, and third place in all aspects of design. that would be cool. then you could sell those winning tables, or edit the honorable mentions. or something... i don't know. i like all pinball games.. this is a really good one. the realism i like about it. and... you don't have to buy like a million table packs for a lot of money. if you get the gold and the achievement... that's almost all the tables right there. i love the top scoring thing... which shows your score and rank vs. the other players in real time.peace. very nice.

								I paid for the vr support before trying because I was enthusiastic about having some new tables to play after playing the heck out of Pinball FX VR. I guess I'll write it off as a loss and hope they use my money to make the game better somehow. I just don't know how they'd do that.  I HATEd every table I played. And I played them all. Most of them had it's own moment of spurious BS. I define spurious BS as being able to laucnch a ball and watch it immediatley bounce uncontrollably into an outlane. The kind of thing that makes me throw my hands up and quit in disgust. I don't know if it's just my bad luck but my mood steadily dropped as I played from gung ho to completely cheesed. I will never buy any of these tables and, in fact, as soon as I had determined that was how I felt, I immediately uninstalled the game and won't look back.			"

It's fun and feels pretty close to what a real pinball table feels like (I may be old enough to actually remember the pinball heyday). But the interface, and all the stuff they added onto it, it just feels a little clunky and somewhat confusing. Also seems like an engine to get you hooked and then continually pay for additional tables.If they had focused more on the actual gameplay of pinball, which I sort of would have expected on a pinball game, I would recommend it. But there's too much added on here to distract from the good job they did there, it's a no for me.			"

								i don't know how they got the so-called screenshots to look so good but there is no way on earth those screenshots are actual gameplay of this game. naturally you go into this thinking, how hard can it be to make a nice looking, half a room and a few inanimate objects? well it must be tough because this game looks like 2006 in 2016 on my furyx. everything is blocky, all textures look like low res scans of old photos and nothing is round but the ball itself, even the buttons for the flippers are like octagons instead of round circles and the scenery outside the windows is just blobs that vaguely resemble buildings, it's like some old playstation 1 ♥♥♥♥. you guys are gonna have to bring better graphics than this in 2017 if you expect people to be interested in a pinball simulator, i don't give a ♥♥♥♥ how good the physics are, retro graphics are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, that's not why people buy a top-shelf graphics card every year or two. i will not be spending a dime on this product in the future if the graphics don't get up to date with current standards or better. they could have done this on the unreal 4 engine and had practically unlimited graphics possibilties. like pool nation fx for instance, another free to play game. how did they manage to get their hands on unreal 4 engine while this game literally looks like unreal 2004? ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.and i don't care how realistic people say the physics are, i have seen the ball do plenty of completely impossible things like turns and twists out of nowhere. the ball can be going one direction and then suddenly going another or even making a u-turn in the middle of the table, i ♥♥♥♥ you not, i've watched this happen, even im my limited time with this product, the bugged physics are quite apparent.also, what they give you for free is nothing short of a cheesey demo with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rules. it seems no matter how many balls you have left, you are playing on a timer. in other words, you can be doing great, waiting for the ball to return to the flippers and then suddenly, game over, flippers stop working. like some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ arcade cashier stooge just pulled the plug out of the wall and said, ""closing time, i don't care where you go but you can't stay here."".i don't want to give them any ideas but i am surprised they don't charge extra money for the screen resolution and antialiasing.well, ♥♥♥♥ you too, magic pixel kft. i don't see any reason to spend my money or time on your product.

								while the physics and the graphics are good the tables are quiet boring and simplistic. I should have researched Zaccaria pinball tables on their website before buying this simulator.the tables are very simple and probably ranks extermely low in terms of complexity and challenge.no hard feeling toward the engine again ,, it is the tables that are bad by design.note: i purchased the gold membership pack ... maybe i am an idiot right ?

								While the graphics for the tables are highly accurate, the overall feel is of a mid 2000's Playstation game.  The controls are ""mushy"" and feel slow to respond.  The physics seem off.  Maybe I'm just spoiled by other pinball simulators that are free and of higher quality.  Go check out Future Pinball.  It's not being actively developed any more, but there's tons of real tables for it and some real gems that are user created.All in all, this Zaccaria Pinball game is worth exactly what I paid for it.  Nothing.			"

								Norton views this game as Malware. I wish I was joking but something in the EXE file outright ticked norton off. Please fix this game so that there is no malware and then hopefully I can play this game again soon.Other than that it is a great game. Simple, easy to learn, difficult to master, the ""Overtime feature"" (As I like to call it) allows you to try and boost your score further after draining all your balls with the length dependant on your skill.Overall, it is a positive experince except for the antivirus going ballistic. hence the thumbs down.

								Zaccaria Pinball is excelent in VR. Classic tables, modernized versions, the ablitly to change the environment to all different times of day and night. Walk around and get close up to the tables to really inspect them. The ability to play standing or seated. Buy Zaccaria Pinball VR or you are so lame. So lame.			"

								Zaccaria Pinball Review - Raymond KTSummary (Kind of): Zaccaria was founded by three brothers (Marino, Franco, & Natale) and was the 3rd largest manufacturer of pinball machines in the world (behind Bally & Williams). They had created and produced more than 35 different pinball machines between 1974 and 1987. Zaccaria Pinball has tones of awesome customization features which affect to graphics and physics aspects of the game. As well as there is a camera editor. Graphics Tweaks: Room Light, Metal FX, Particle FX, Dynamic Light, Reflection FX, Glow FX, Motion Blur, Lightmap, Colors Physics Tweaks: Flipper Size, Playfield Tilt, Flipper Force, Ball Elasticity, Ball Friction, Slingshot Force, Bumper Force, Ball Velocity, Plunger Force, Flipper Tap PassA very good, very pretty recreation of some real-life tables, and now some originals and remixes of the classic tables. The physics are, for the most part, great. About as good as The Pinball Arcade if not a little better. Just be warned that right now the game is in Early Access, and unless you're a real pinhead looking for a fix you'll probably get frustrated very quickly with the constant tweaking of the graphics and physics engine.The developers seem to subscribe to the ""If it isn’t broke, break it"" philosophy, so maybe for now just keep the free play client installed and play around with the tables until they finally ""settle"" on a finished product. I went ahead and purchased because it was worth it for me to get to play these tables with no limits, but mileage may vary. "

								Zaccaria Pinball is absolutely amazing!! This is by far the best pinball simulation ever made, (that I've played anyway). I like it even better than Pinball Arcade, and that's saying something because Pinball Arcade is absolutely AMAZING!! I really love how you can change the time of day that you play the pinball machines so as to accentuate the lighting of the table, (I especially like playing during a storm). It really adds to the atmosphere. Amazing job!!! I could play this all day.			"

								Really a treat!  I'm so glad I bit the bullet and picked up all of the tables while they were on sale.  I see some others have mentioned the physics of the ball is off but I haven't noticed (note: I'm an amateur when it comes to pinball).  The table select menu is very colorful and cool.  All of the tables I've played so far are fun.  I guess it'd be nice to be able to pick different locations for the room you're playing in but the default space is fine.			"

								It seems to have all the functionality of Pinball FX 1 and 2. Theres less flash then the fx tables considering a lot of them are liscensed. FX seems to play and flow a bit smoother. Zaccaria has quite a bit of variety from the demos of the tables I play. Definitely some ""cheap moments"" where the ball flies out of bounds randomly, but I feel like thats just a part of pinball itself. The tables are styled after great classics, and some are direct remakes of real tables. Tables are also a bit cheaper due to the fact most of the tables aren't liscensed. The sound effects sound right, but sometimes they can be grating. Especially vocal samples. Overall it's a great game, and most of my complaints are finnicky. If you love pinball, and need something different from Pinball FX this will definitely work, and since it's early acess hopefully they will improve on any minor complaints people have.			"

								These tables are faithful reproductions of the actual pinball machines (You can go on Youtube to compare the game to the real thing).  The thing I notice about Zaccaria tables are that the original designers seemed to get lazy as some of the tables are very similar to one another and feature the same design elements.  A few of the tables are extremely frustrating because there is little to do, or the ball naturally funnels to the center of the table so that it goes right thru the center of the flippers everytime, or seems to find the outlane too often.  But I imagine that this is a flaw with the original table, not the video game itself.  I suggest you give it a try and only purchase the tables that you find enjoyable.			"

								A great game.  It's more old school pinball, therefore it is a bit tougher than other pinball games but it has a great one more game hook to it.  I enjoy picking a new table and playing it until I get in the top ten on the leaderboard (or so . . . the VR version doesn't have that many players).  I have this for the Vive and it's really bloody close to having these machines in real life (and I own  pinball machine).  One of my go to VR games when I want something a little less tense or active.			"
