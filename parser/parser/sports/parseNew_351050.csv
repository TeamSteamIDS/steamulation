												As always, this is an excellent cricket simulation game. Unlike the last few versions, this one has some much needed new features/improvements. To name just a few, the added Indian domestic leagues (which will please many). The ODI and T20 match engines have notably improved with much larger scores now possible. The lesser teams like Bangladesh and Zimbabwe have been given more attention leading to more accurate team selections. There are many more little improvements for the better that you will find out as you play the game.Overall, I honestly think this is a game to get for any cricket fan.  "

There are many fantastic new features including fielding coaching, new leagues, new stadiums, pitches and graphics, as well as a really accurate game engine across all three formats.If you love cricket, then you HAVE to get this game!I will post more after I have clocked up more hours!

												I'm very pleased to say that this year's Cricket Captain is probably the biggest step forward the series has seen to date - they've eliminated a lot of stupid bugs that have been in the game for ages, and their 3d graphics actually look pretty okay now, with added shadows etc. The match engine has always been the key of the game, though, and it too has been updated to better reflect the aggressive cricket of the modern era, throwing up fantastic results that mirror real life in an unpredictable way, such that old Cricket Captain games would not have been able to manage.8/10, biggest improvement I've ever seen in the series.

												Cricket Captain 2015, the same game every year with given a tiny application of makeup and making no progress whatsoever. The thing is, Cricket Captain is basically a Cricket Manager game, minus 90% of management features that are needed to make the game interesting. But let me get the pro's out of the way with first;The match engine is brilliant, the statistical information available to the player is brilliant. The one-day and 20-20 match engines have been tweaked and are better than previous instalments. Graphics have finally gotten a facelift, but animations remain the same as in previous versions pretty much, thus edges mostly go in the same areas and not always to shots that make sense.To demonstrate the laziness; the animations for the umpires to signal 'byes' is the real life signal for leg byes, this has been like this for the past three or four instalments, it can't be that hard to fix surely?Outside of the match engine, there is almost nothing for an aspiring manager to do. Yeah, there is team building from the transfer market, and the promotion of youth players. You also get to adjust the budgets a little, but the initial funding doesn't change (aside from prize money), there's no opportunity to build the club up as you become more successful. There's no chance to look more in depth at a youth or reserve team, and you can't hire a specific number of physios or coaches. Training is limited, staff numbers are linked to the budget but never anymore than numbers rather than actual personalities themselves - a batting coach who is aggressive for example, or a bowling coach with his own philosophy - nope, they're just generic numbers.And that, really is the problem with the game. It's a spreadsheet game, with all your time spent looking at statistical averages. Best batsman number 1 will always be replaced by generic youth product number 51, because there are no personalities in the game, nothing to indicate ability (outside of averages), nothing to indicate talent (outside of averages) because there's no staff to talk to, no youth team to develop and team to mould in line with bigger games such as Football Manager.The whole thing, is just a numbers game without any real flavour to it. The hardcore fans and cricket nuts will pick it up as usual, but aside from reading the numbers and possibly playing around with tactics in the admittedly decent match engine there's nothing outside to keep things interesting, no media, no discussions, no personalities, training events or anything that adds spark and interest. Nothing but your imagination and the bland numbers popping up as each match goes by.For a series that has been around for a long while now, they really need to get with the times and produce something more than a match engine.

												I have loved the Cricket Captain series for a long time, and I buy it every couple of years. This version is as much fun as always and looks a good deal slicker than previous versions, which is great.I still feel like the series is a little lazy, especially when compared with sports management simulators where there is more competition - e.g. Football Manager. A few small changes could make this series so much better.One major failing is that it is impossible to be sacked or to move counties or countries once you have started a game. I think it would be great if the Board of your team (domestic or international) set seasonal goals and would review your position based on your attainment of the goals. These could be based around performance in competitions, development of youth players, marquee signings, or anything like this. Similarly, fan satisfaction would be a great feature - are the fans happy with the performance of the team; are the attached to the players; do they like the style of cricket you're playing? If so, more fans should turn up to games and the county should make more money.In international cricket, each country's pool of talent seems to remain fairly static despite retirals and regenerations. This has in the past been frustrating as a New Zealand fan. There should also be a mechanism for a team's prestige to change, so that if you manage NZ or WI or whoever to be the no.1 side in a format, other teams will want to host longer and more regular series against your team. It is frustrating to have a great player in a New Zealand shirt who can't have a real crack at breaking records because he'll only play 60 tests in his career. It should also be possible to move international teams to keep variety and interest.I love the statistical elements of this game, especially that retired player stats are now saved. The kind of people who love cricket and play these games love statistics, so keep them coming! The more the better! For example, saving players' scoring areas over the whole of their career, saving as many quirky stats as possible about your nation or club (e.g. all time best XIs, players of the season, most runs/wickets in a 2/3/4/5 match test/ODI/T20I series, most matches, most matches as captain, boundary totals, most % runs in innings, etc). I'd also love to see Decision Reviews introduced (a really important part of captaincy these days), and realistic rain delays in one-day cricket with Duckworth-Lewis adjusted totals.A few small changes like this would make the game feel more real, more immersive, and ultimately more enjoyable.Still, I love this series, and would give this game four out of five stars.

												The usual slow evolution rather than revolution for this series, but sensibly priced.  Fans of the series will want it just for the updated database, but there are significant improvements as well, not least the essential changes to batting aggression in limited overs matches.  Anyone else who knows, and cares, what the difference between a seam and a swing bowler is will want it as well.  To them, recommended.  To anyone else, forget it.  Probably.

I can also see fans of management type games like Football Manager even enjoying this too. If you love the sport you will love this.

												Cricket Captain 2015 follows exactly the same format and game play as every previous version going back 15 years.  The only noticeable changes are to the graphics on the highlights.  These however, still look very poor and dated.Everything else remains the same as previous versions and this new release follows the same path of them updating stats whilst keeping the gameplay and interface identical to previous versions.   You can also now play the Indian FC league too.  If you already own a recent version of cricket captain then this new version is little more than a database update.  If you don't own a previous version then it is worth buying as it is still a fun game although after years of very little development to the actual game play it does feel a very tired series now.

												A newcomer to the series and not an overly passionate cricket fan so it's surprising how much I am enjoying this game.As a long time player of the Football Manager series, sports management is a genre I love, although this is the first time I've enjoyed any cricket game. If you know nothing about cricket do not worry, I'm no expert but after a couple of hours playing this my understanding of the game definitely improved, the subtleties of this fine sport are revealing themselves to me as I play and I can now watch a real match and follow what's going on.If you like management sims and sports games I recommend you try this, if you love cricket then I assume you already have it, if not you really need to get it.

												Well another year and another version of Cricket Captain.The difference this year is rather than a tweak here and there instead we have 2 major enhancements in terms of the new Indian domestic league and the new highlights offering which is absolutely amazing, plus a large number of smaller chnages which massively add to the overall feelgood fasctor of the game.Additional data (2nd XI averages for all 3 formats) is now easily available when it comes to either team selection or the purchasing of ne players which although might seem a very basic change it will benefit so many of us once the contracts section kicks in - havent we all bought that 18 year old with a 45+ 2nd XI average to then find out he stinks in both 50 and 20 over games!! ..... not any more as you see how he has performed so no more guess work.PLayer averages against each international country - yes please .... sorted!!If only you could coach fielding and keeping as well as batting and bowling... now you can :)Wish I could see the batting aggression for squad without having to select a player ..... now they are all displayed on the main squad screen ... simple change but a quick win!The best version of this great game by a country mileWell done guys!!DVDDD "

ICC13 contained one of my favourite saves to date, and it was always going to take a good new edition to make me leave that.CC14 did go some way to doing that, but I found myself straying back. Not so with CC15 though, this is the most polished version to date. Thoroughly enjoyable, I've once again found the enjoyment I got from sinking many hours into the game.

												I've played every Cricket Captain game since it's inception many years ago and I've thoroughly enjoyed the series.  I probably don't need to get each edition as some have been nothing more than a databse update with a few minor additions, but this is clearly the best cricket management game on the market.  Nothing comes close.So should you buy it?  The short answer is yes.  The three major leagues in England, India and Australia are all well covered and there are plenty of options to play both in and out of the game.  You can be a hands on coach and play every ball, go a little less with every over or even sim through games you don't feel you need to play.  It really is good stuff and you can get hours of enjoyment out of it.  With a few seasons under my belt I've been able to build a very handy side in all three formats as the contract system works well.There are, however, a few things that need to be mentioned that haven't been fixed in years.1. - There is no true way to see just how good a player is or the potential they have.  The only way you can tell is at the end of the season when you sign their contract - if they ask for a higher amount (eg. above $50,000) then you can be assured you are generally getting a good player.  However outside of this it's hit and miss.  I've signed players for big bucks that have been a huge disappointement.  Why?  I don't really know.  Adding in a system like this would be sensational and help decide the make up of your team better.2. - There are some incosistencies with the AI.  There seem to be far too many LBW's and often when you change a batsman's aggressiveness they can go out in the next over.  The AI is generally pretty good but be prepared for the odd frustration here and there.3. - The training system is only decent.  There are plenty of options to choose from but there is no way to tell how well things are working.  This ties into being able to see how good a player is or the potential of how good they CAN be with the right training.  Fixing this would be excellent.Outside of those criticism's this is an excellent game and if you can sink some time into it you'll thoroughly enjoy it.			"

												Everything you want from a realistic cricket simulation... apart from one thing.  You are only allowed to win once in a while by total random luck.  No mattter how poor you opponent is or how great you are for the first 75% of the match, the simulation becomes a nonsense for the remainder of the game.  The computer will score 200 runs for no wicket in the last session, or you will lose 8 wickets if you are batting.  This game is not a simulation it is a script, and like most repetative stories it eventually becomes boring.			"

Well luckily for you, it's easy to navigate around because absolutely nothing has changed in about 5 years. Everything is the same except for the obvious player names, a few more teams and updated statistics.If you play other management games such as Football Manager or Pro Cycling Manager, there's somesort of an improvement year on year and you'd expect that from pretty much every game you play but this, i actually can't find anything new at all. It's so dated and i've tried to get into it but i just can't. Not recommended if you're looking for Crickets answer to Football Manager			"

												This game is a lot like other sports management games and is pretty in depth. Best thing about the game is that most things are pretty straight forward if you are smart enough to be a cricket fan. Very enjoyable and easy to get into if you are a fan of the sport. Other fans of the game talk about the game being nothing more than a roster update but little things that make the game more realistic are added to every version. This version had had the Indian domestic tournaments added which I have been waiting for for about a decade ever since I played the 2005 version. The one thing I hope the developers  decide to add to the game is a comprehensive editor which would add a lot of value to the game. That minor hiccup aside, this is a game I would recommend to people who like cricket and sports management games.			"

												Unless there are a lot of subtleties to Cricket that this game misses and I'm just unaware of, Cricket Captain 2015 deserves far better than a 'mixed' review level. I knew next to nothing about Cricket, but I do play a lot of sports management sims. I don't think there's a major game of that genre that I haven't played, and this seems like one of the better ones. The in-game graphics are outstanding for a management sim, just compare it to OOTP and FM. The management isn't as deep as those two games, of course, but it's good enough to satisfy me. What I really like about CC 2015 is the fog of war regarding players. You don't have visible attribute settings that tell you exactly how good a player is. You get told what his tendencies are and what his stats are, and you work out from there if he'll be a fit for you or not. If a player is performing crap, you think, well, is he just unlucky? Am I using him wrong? Or is he actually crap? The player attributes make most management games easy to win; this game on the other hand is a great challenge. In OOTP there are a sizable minority of us who play using 'stats only', where we turn attributes off and evaluate players based on performance. If you're an OOTP player who enjoys that style, you'll love this. I'm very happy with this purchase.			"

Posted: July 29, 2015
												I’ve never played any of the previous games in this series, so my review is based solely on this game.If you’re a fan of cricket (and if you’re checking out the game, then I’d assume that’s a given) then it’s fun to pick real players to play in your games.  You can also pick young up and coming players, and if they turn out to be good enough, you can watch them progress, hopefully into great players.Firstly, the UI looks dated.  It really could do with an update.  There’s relatively limited ways in which you can influence what’s going on during a match, so a lot of it is out of your hands.  That in itself isn’t so bad, since that’s basically what happens with Football Manager.  Probably the biggest problem I have with the game, though, is lack of information.  There’s limited stats available to help you to make informed decisions.  For example, there seems to be no way to judge which wicket keeper is better than any other, since there’s no actual wicket keeping stats available, not that I’ve ever found.  You can assign trainers to players, but it’s extremely difficult to tell if it’s having any affect.  In Football Manager, for instance, you can quite easily see what affect your trainer is having on the player, and whether you’re wasting your time trying to improve that area of the player.  You also can’t hire and fire trainers, since they’re nameless and faceless.The game is fun, but really could be a lot more fun, and only if it undergoes a serious make-over, and it really does need one.  If there’s a 2016 version of this game, and it still essentially looks and plays the same, then there’s no way I’d buy it.  An updated player database wouldn’t be enough to make me put down the dollars.			"

												When I was in school, my math teachers always insisted we ""show our work"" - we had to demonstrate what steps we took to get from the base equation we had been given to the answer we came up with. I once got a 0/100 on an assignment because I didn't show my work. The teacher wrote the score on the page in front of me and scolded me in front of the entire class for it.Cricket Captain 2015 is very much in that same boat.The trick with most sports managment sims is, they demonstrate an athlete's abilities to the player through an attributes system; for instance, in Football Manager, Gonzalo Higuaín is better as a striker than Carlos Puyol not just because that is his natural position, but also because he has a much higher ""Shooting"" attribute, and probably several others that reflect his strengths. This is done to give the player a general guideline for whether he should expect success, failure, or something in between in a given matchup or scenario, even though it won't always work exactly the way the numbers dictate.Cricket Captain 2015 does not do this. There is not clear and present attribute system, merely a series of standard cricket statistics and nebulous ""Form"" and ""Fitness"" ratings. Yet, the Form rating is hardly perfect, because I frequently have players with one-star Form wildly outperforming players with three- or four-star Form, and Fitness doesn't have any effect at all that I've noticed or had explained to me. The manual explains that batsmen also have a fatigue rating during matches, but fatigue is only visible for bowlers, so you as captain don't know when to dial back the aggression on your batsmen and try to let them recover for another big push. Unless you just recognize the names of bowlers, you really have no idea who will be good and who won't until they've taken a couple of wickets, which doesn't reflect the intense scouting and scrutiny of high-level sports. The player is given little control over what his team does, which can lead to a lot of frustrating big overs for opposing bats and wickets lost for your own side.This is made all the more frustrating by the fact that there clearly is some sort of underlying attributes system that the player just isn't allowed to see. I get messages through my training sessions that players have improved certain attributes. What were those attributes before, and what are they now? Being able to see those things would allow me to adjust what I'm instructing my players in, so I know if I'm wasting my time trying to make a bowler more accurate or trying to make my young wicketkeeper a better fielder.Despite a manual that does offer a few useful tips, the developers don't seem to have taken into account that this could be someone's first deep exposure to cricket, as evidenced by the lack of a tutorial of any kind. I've logged almost four hours in this game and still don't quite know what everything does. A scripted T20 or ODI match to help players get a feel for how the game works and how the sport works.The game also lacks pretty much all forms of polish. I've had games where the field completely disappears and leaves the players standing on a black screen during highlights. There is no music of any kind. There's an option for menu sound, but there is no menu sound. These things are baseline in video games these days, so their absence is duly noted here.For all the flak I give this game, I don't think it's that far away from being pretty good. It just needs to do a better job of giving its players information about why things are happening the way they are. Overall, if you're a die-hard fan of cricket with $25 burning a hole in your pocket, that probably won't stop you from finding some measure of enjoyment from this game. Everyone else should hold off and see what the 2016 edition looks like.			"

												I played ICC2 (?) back in 99. I wheel it out ever year, for a couple of weeks but lost my CD recently. So took plunge and bought this. Wow what a disappointment. Essentially the same game as 99 one, with some worse features (i.e. all info not on one screen as previously). I expect if you have any evolution between this and 99, there is no need to get this game.What really did it for me though is the games are obviously pre-ordained before you even play. I played the same game 4 times, on 4 new start games (1st Notts v Middlesex) and got the same result with virtually identical scores, whatever i did. Middlesex 450 1st inns, notts 270 odd 1st inns etc. Classically on the 3rd attemp, I had Middlesex 240 odd for 8 (batting second), when 9 & 10 both scored 100's to get them to 450 odd. on 4th again batting second had them 130 odd for 6 and last 4 wickets put on 300 odd to get to the 450. REALLY....... that's just bad and I felt the game was playingme. A terrible game and a waste of my time and money. I loved ICC2 but this isn't worth the effort.AVOID			"

												I really enjoy being able to play fantasy test series using the all time great players, but I would very much like to see more South African players from the years that they were banned from Test cricket.I suppose that more all time greats, from all the test playing nations would be a good thing.Apart from my preferences, this is still the best cricket game I`ve seen,			"

												I would love to say this game is good but it is flawed as anything. In terms of batting you set the level of aggression and let your batters do their jobs, Problem is you tell them to block and defend and they will all get out slogging for 6. Madness. The bowling, your bowlers will spend overs and overs and overs bowling on a pitch that has apparently no demons and you cant get a wicket. Even if you have the best bowlers in the world. When the opponents play on the same pitch it is like a mine field. You get such limited control over how bowlers bowls and the plans that it isnt immersive it is just dull. The series has been released for so many years now that they should be further ahead then they are. It seems like they have just spend all their budget on getting Jonathan Agnew to do commentary and then remembered that they need a game to go along with his voice. It is too basic to be worth it, the foundations might be there for a good game but so so much has to be done.			"

												Painfully frustrating game.There is no way to tell the talent of a player when you recuit them, some basic scouting would make this game far more enjoyable. There seems to be little or no effect of coaching. Batting is a joke with seemingly your team going out LBW 4-5 times per innings, the wicket keeper drops ever catch when bowling (again no way to tell of his actual keeping ability), the bowlers get hit for 4's constantly when bowling defensive... GO figureDon't waste your time trying to figure it out, go play a soccer management sim at least there you can recruit and develop players and have some actual idea of their skill level.			"

												A testament to how English the developers are is how Lyth, Ballance and Buttler can actually bat in this as opposed to real life.Recommended for anyone English or who otherwise has dreadful teeth. "

												I'd like to give this a positive review, because there's no other decent cricket games out there, but I can't. In short it's not great.Tactics are thrown out of the window. Batting is random and out of your control.  And the only way to get someone out is to bowl at the stumps over and over and over again, which isn't exactly fun.In my case it's definitely not been worth the rather large amount of money I spent on it.

												This is a wonderful cricket simulation game - hands down the best I've ever played.  I think I've sunk something like 400 hours into this game and its 2014 predecessor, more than any other game I own on steam.  This game has two weaknesses that I think account for most of the negative reviews on steam.  Its true that this game lacks some of the wider elements of sports management that other high profile titles have.  Its strength is its match engine though, which performs well across all forms of the game (one dayers, tests and T20s) and can still give the occassional surprise. Seriously, I've played this game for 400 hours plus, and every game is still a nailbiter. The other weakness is the fact that the game is evolving only slowly - I think most of the negative reviews on steam relate to disappointment from people who have bought previous editions and were hoping for more from the latest.  That seems to be true to a degree, but doesnt change the fact that this is a great cricket management game.  Its also the case that the game is developed by a very small team - I imagine it cant be easy to make a living out of a game like this.  So for me I'm happy to pay for updates to keep the game moving forward.  If you love cricket, do yourself a favour and buy this game.			"

												If you have any recent version, don't bother, the upgrade is not much except for a player list, but if you haven't had a version for a while it's worth a go.Being able to play the Australian Domestic teams was great, but the problem is the 2020 still doesn't work, it's impossible to score enough runs to make it competitive, and the one day isn't much better.  It's amazing that they still haven't fixed this, but the 4 day version and tests work well.The gameplay is good, and there is improvement with things like physio and coaching, so it's better from a management point of view.  Overall pretty good.			"

												I find there is plenty to enjoy about this game. I've bought and played plenty of versions. There is a good historical scenario series between Eng and Aus. I the fact you can design your owns sides using greats from yesteryear for all the test playing nations and have games against each other.I've been playing the 20/20 World Cup and after a steep learning curve i got to finally win a world cup with the West Indies. A niche' game, yet easily the best niche' cricket game there is.			"
