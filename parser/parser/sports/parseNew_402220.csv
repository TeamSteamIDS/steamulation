YouTube™ Video: Apoch Plays w/ Dana and 'Lift It' | Humor Play (Early Access) 

			Views: 468		

			NOTE: This video was initially 45 minutes long. I cut it down in hopes to at least turn a boring video into something humorous, but still gives you an idea of what playing this game is like.		

Trolling/jokes aside: This could actually be an interesting reverse RPG title. I commend the developers for doing something different, however the execution is too basic to really be fun. Everything looks the same, not to mention like it's the PlayStation 1 days once more, there's no variety in training other than mashing the up button, the battle controls seem archaic... there's just little fun to be had in such a basic title with honest-to-goodness anti-RPG ideas that genuinely seem fresh in a world of RPG Maker titles.The other big issue is the cost. Nearly $10 for this title is just too much. The comedic ""so bad"" value of the Johnny Bravo simulator is lost once you realize the island is populated by the childeren of the Sega Dreamcast's Seaman creatures, leaving you to regret such a high priced title. $4.99 US is even pushing it, but would have been a little more justifiable to the game's shortcomings...**EDIT: At some point, the price for this game dropped from $9.99 when not on sale, to $7.99. Just pointing this out, as I have no idea when it was done. I think it's still a bit too steep (I stand by my $4.99 suggestion), but it is a little more tantalizing a price point than the earlier $9-$10 ticket for admission.**			"

								3.2/10 - About As Fun As REAL Weight Lifting... Not Very.When I saw this game I was pretty excited, but this only carried through for about 3 minutes of gameplay. The world is quite repetitive; there are 20 different gyms with only 2 different formats, Vendors that sell protein powder out of fish market stalls etc.. Yes, it's Early Access, but it's definitely dead! Last update was Jan 3 which is insulting and confirming.Actual training and weight challenges were both the exact same; identical buildings across from each other. You complete 'reps' by mashing the up arrow repeatedly for 30-50 seconds, you don't even have to try that hard to be victorious. It's a terrible game and it's dead. Don't waste your dough.Overall, Worth $0. Don't support garbage and developers that dip out! Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

								Have you ever been a gym junkie? Well I have found the game for you. It’s our second day of running 89AM Studio’s games and today’s game is Lift It. If you’re a recovering gym junkie or want to experience that life style then you may want to check this game out… That is until you wear out your up key. You see, shout out to Xavier Woods of WWE fame, this is the game that is all about the up up but not the down down. Every task you perform at the gym is a race to see how fast you can press the up arrow key. Every single bloody task.You see you can lift it, you can bench it, hell you can even tread mill your way to glory and fame but every single one of those will be a repetitive press of the up key. The game may have been a quality game – well at least better than what it is – if there was any thought put into the game design. Why not have the tread mill be a combination of left and right arrows signifying the moving of your feet. Weight lifting could could be up and down to signify the fact that you’re raising it and lowering it, squats could be an arrow key and a down key to signifying an action of bending, etc. It wouldn’t take much thought but the monotony of the actions would be decreased and you may want to play further than ten or twenty minutes into the game.I had to laugh when I saw that the first non-player controlled character was ‘old master.’ He looks like what I would imagine a 20-year old Asian gang member to look like. Quite funny and no disrespect at all meant at all to the gang members. The graphics appear to be straight out of the very first year of Information Technology programming class’s programming language and it plays similarly too.Given that it’s still in early access it’s too early to earmark this one down as a dud but a lot of work will have to go into raising its level. Given that the developers have worked on and released 3 Coins at School since putting this one out into early access it is doubtful that it will receive the attention that it desperately needs.			"

								Hey you! do you like pushing your keyboard button multiple times? Does your arm get sore from that kind of junk?!This is the game for you! Quite literally its the best game to be a pusher. You have to do four challenges! THATS RIGHT.Oh, sorry thats just exercising! Time four by eight and you get to push the button up and down furiously thirty-two times!Literally played this a few minutes. Wouldn't mind anything else about this game but the pushing.			"

								Man, the desire to meme here is real, but I'll try my best to keep it professional:Lift It is not worth any meaningful amount of money, however if you can acquire it through a bundle, Steam sale, a friend playing a gift prank on you, or drunk Steam shopping, you definitely should try it out. Lift It is a hellish mess of glued-together concepts, awful 3d models, and repetitive gameplay elements, but boy did I get some good laughs out of it. I'm genuinely curious if 89AM Studios is a couple of 15-year-olds making a project for a programing class or if this game is the work of some present day gamer David Lynch; either way this game is equal parts horrible and genius. Let's just break it down shall we?Pros:+Described on paper, this game has about everything your modern gamer desires in one package.+Hour(s?) of amusement .+There's multiplayer?.Cons:-Graphics of a year 2000-esque PC game with random 2010-ish gloss and water effects thrown in.-Characters models all look deformed or addicted to steroids.-There's a couple of pre-set resolutions to chose from...all of which look awful on a 16:10 monitor.-No option to change the controls what-so-ever.-W&S keys move forwards and backwards, but A&D do not strafe for some reason.-You walk slow as hell and the sprint key makes you run at a hilariously inhuman pace.-Even with being able to run the game world is entirely too big.-I don't think there's a text menu in the game without a spelling or grammar error.-The core of the game is mashing the up key. That's it.-I'm not sure it's possible to 'beat' the game without using a macro to mash the up key as fast as technically possible. I barely beat the last 'boss' with a macro set to mash the up key at .01 millisecond intervals, so be prepared to flex those finger muscles if you plan to play this legitimately.-The game is also entirely grinding. You mash the up key to gain stats. You then mash the up some more key to beat gym leaders and get ""golds"". You spend the golds to buy armor and fight people. That's the whole game.-Golds also take entirely too long to earn; in order to unlock top tier armor you would need to play this game for hundreds of hours.-Fighting is stiff, confusing, and boring.-I can't even begin to describe the music choices in this game. I can't walk into a gym without laughing hysterically because of how amusing hearing a 'hard rock' version of Auld Lang Syne is.-NOBODY'S BUTTS ARE ANIMATED. WHEN YOU RUN YOUR BUTT STAYS PERFECTLY IN PLACE WHILE THE REST OF YOU MOVES.-Dying just punts you back to the main menu; hope you saved!-The ♥♥♥♥ing eyelashesIn summary, 10/10, get in the alpha early and start getting those GAINZ			"

								[English Review]First, I thought this game will be bad of everything. The menu is amateurish, graphics is awful, gameplay is weird and repetitive, animation is like a robot, NPC doesn't have a good A.I., world area is boring with weird building for a gym on this gym island. So, everything in this game is awful when you look at it and not to play it. Just try the game a little bit, because I found this game is hilarious funny and made my day with a good laugh. I'll never had a good laugh while playing a games recently than watching a good comedy movies. Yes, it is bad but it so good. It is horrible game but genius when you look at it in the different side. Confused !?Pros :+ After playing this, the gym is the best place to build from your fat or skinny body to your dream body.+ Good Soundtrack+ Hilarious funny+ Lift Weight is fun+ Who doesn't want dance with Sarah ?+ You can made music from burp+ Sport RPG games+ Gladiator arenaCons :- Outdated graphics- Empty world area- Weird physics, especialy when run (shift key) made you run like the flash- Dumb AISo, I can't recommend this game if you want a good games. But if you want an entertaining games that made your day, this game is one of the best choice. It is bad, but it is so good !10/10 wanna go to gym again and workout with dumbbell for 10 reps.______________________________________________________________[Indonesian short review]Lift It mungkin akan menjadi game yang paling disukai sama Agung Hercules, kalau dia sempat main game ini di steam sambil jualan bakso. Terutama karena ada goyang astuti di game ini. Pokoknya salam barbel, kalau tidak goyang barbel melayang. TGBM rules !			"

								Alright, listen, this isn't a good game.It doesn't play very well, 75% of the game is grinding that will mess up your hands by making you mash the ""UP"" key and the sword fighting is like playing Mount & Blade on tranquilizers.But the thing is, Lift It somehow manages to be amazing.It's such an incomprehensible, surreal mess of concepts and themes, you'd be hard-pressed to hate its soul.I hope this game goes places.If the developer(s) keep(s) at it, this pandora's box of muscles and swords will definitely be a must-have, if not for the gameplay, then for the bewildering experience it will provide.tl;drItalian/10, strongest game I've played in years.

								Welcome to Gym Island. A location fit for only the biggest of the big. Lift It is literally a peace of art. The game allows you to Bench, Squat, Deadlift, and use the Treadmill to your heart's desire. You will become the best, the biggest, and beat all of the Gym Owners in order to face the next one. Similar to Pokémon, except your muscles are your weapon. You'll press the upward arrow on the keyboard so you can work out beyond your physical strength. There's also a weapon system and islands to fight monsters on, but I doubt I'll play long enough to reach that. The game is for fun, and a good time passer.Pros: More realistic than me at the gym, a time killer, and if you're too lazy to get off your♥♥♥♥♥and work out - a good gym workout.Cons: Looks and feels like a game straight out of the early 2000's.
