												Wow, I am simple amazed. ATARI has finally nailed it, the compilation is great, controls are very customizable for each title (mouse, keyboard or gamepad), including gamepad sensitivity. I'm using a Razer Sabertooth and had no issues with controls on various games. Ease to access a multitude of titles, including a fast access / recent played games list.Some pluses as original boxes, manuals and other reliquia add value to the package.Totally worth it!			"

												Why yes, I have played Atari today.And it was amazing.As a collection, it's a great value. Contained within the Vault are faithful emulations of the original Atari arcade games, such as Asteroids, Centipede, Missile Command, and my personal favorite, Tempest. It even introduced me to a few I'd never had the chance to play, before -- Crystal Castles, Black Widow, Liberator, and Major Havoc are great fun, and I'm happy to have had the chance to try them out. Heck, even the original Pong arcade cabinet is here.Then you have a selection of perfectly-emulated Atari 2600 games, complete with 3D models of the original boxes and scans of the original manuals, to boot. (Even the aforementioned arcade games are represented with 3D recreations of their cabinets, too!) Many of them play best with multiple people, and thankfully, Atari Vault gives you the option for not only local multiplayer, but online multiplayer as well, on top of high score leaderboards.Controls for each game are fully customizable, from a gamepad to a keyboard. Which is great, considering that a few of these games used to be controlled with a trackball or paddle. I used a Steam Controller for most of these games, and the touch-sensitive circle pads actually worked really well for paddle controller stuff. I found it could be somewhat over-sensitive at times, requiring me to adjust the settings a lot, but it wasn't a terrible inconvenience or anything. And -- I'm not sure if this is a bug or what, but -- on a few games in particular, pressing a button that is normally bound to an action (fire, special action, etc) causes it to open the game menu AND perform the action. That proved to be rather annoying, but it only happened a couple of times to me.As for the overall game selection? Good, for the most part. While there's a few stinkers in there -- mostly a few of those sports games, painfully-boring ""learning games"" intended for very young children, and I'm not sure why an intriguing but nigh-unplayable prototype of Tempest for the 2600 is stuffed in there, but yep it's there too -- a lot of them are good, simple fun, which offsets the bad. Warlords is a blast, Yars' Revenge is a classic, Millipede is great fun, and Asteroids... well, it's Asteroids. It's hard to screw up Asteroids. The arcade versions of some 2600 games are obviously the superior version, but I like playing both of them, just to take note of and enjoy the differences. Though it's definitely missing a few 2600 games I would have liked to see (no Jungle Hunt? Battlezone? Berzerk, even?), it's a great collection on its own, even if most of the better 2600 games were produced by other companies or based on licensed properties.Criticisms? Well... emulation quality is fine, sound is okay, the menus and options are fairly easy to navigate... I suppose some of the manual scans are a bit on the fuzzy, low-res side, so it makes them kinda hard to read at times. And the ""soundtrack"" isn't very prevalent anywhere except the menus, where you are bound to spend essentially 5% of your overall playtime in. It sounds fine, if a little forgettable. Maybe an option to include tunes (or your own personal songs) during gameplay would be welcome? (I for one like to play the Tempest 2000 soundtrack while I'm playing Tempest, but that's just me.) These aren't serious or grating issues for me, though.Now, despite my glowing praise, I would have to say my recommendation is ""conditional"", in a sense. By all means, these games are classics, and I believe it's important to preserve and remember them. Reintroducing these titles to the newer generation is also something I enjoy the prospect of. But, well... if you aren't nostalgic for these games, then you should be aware that these are from a very different period of videogame history. These games are very simple, both in concept and design. Reading the manual is usually required. They may confuse and frustrate you as easily as they can inspire and entertain. They can potentially offer hours upon hours of enjoyment, or you can play them for five minutes and get bored. Yet, at twenty dollars for a hundred games, there's not much risk involved. Why not give it a try? Set a few high scores while you're at it, too.TL;DR, a great collection of Atari classics and an excellent value to boot. You really can't go wrong.			"

												Disappointing execution of some classic games.  The biggest issue is, sigh, as always, controls for the trackball and rotary dial games like Tempest, Warlords, Centipede, etc.  It's simple, right?  Map the mouse to act as a trackball or dial?  It shouldn't be that hard.  It ISN'T that hard, seeing as how many other pieces of software manage to do this just fine.  But not Atari Vault.  Either the mouse can't be set to be sensitive enough to make the game playable (even at the highest sensitivity setting) or it just flat-out doesn't work.That said, the joystick games work just fine, either mapped to a keyboard or with a variety of gamepads.  Even there, though, you cannot turn v-sync on and so most games exerpience ""tearing"".  Just really lazy execution here.  The in-menu extras like manuals and PR documents are cool, but are scanned in low-res and sometimes aren't even legible.  The overall presentation is slick enough, but there wasn't enough attention paid to detail and the result is that this product feels slapped together as just another lazy appeal to nostalgia.When will game companies give us an alternative to legally questionable means of playing these classic games?  And I don't mean packages thrown together with a few games (or even 100, which is still a fraction of the number of games available for the Atari 2600 alone), but a truly viable commercial option for playing classic games?  If you were hoping Atari Vault would be the first one, no dice.  Save your $20 and stick with alternative options - you know what they are.			"

												This is what I've been looking for, for a long, long time.Lemme just make this short, as there are 100 of these games, that everything feels so spot on. GRAPHICS: As I boot up the game, I'm treated to an organized menu of game right from the getgo. Each game is represented by a Cabinet, complete with the original art that you would find right on the real thing. Getting into a game of Black widow to check out the graphics of one of the games, It looks exactly like how I remember it from the good ol' arcade down memory lane. You can clearly see what represents what, and best thing is: It all runs clearly on your computer screen. I ran this on a plasma screen TV, and there was no quality loss on the resolution. For other things, you also getbonus Art from the original covers, and even the Manuals for the games for newcomers, Or if you're like me, for Nostalgia-driven Nerds. Loved looking through them then, and I still love looking at them now.SOUND: Just like I was stuck with awe at the menu, the theme for it is fantastic. Something I will never get annoyed with. Going into black widow again, the sounds are spot on. All those beeps and blips from the good ol' days are back again, and they sound fantastic. Nothing to complain about!Gameplay: Now here's the Shining Jewel on the Golden Crown: The Multiplayer Capabilities, and the Leaderboards. The Leaderboards are just what you expect: They show all the top scores out of your friends, AND in the world. Wanna be the best? Better get crackin' at those Top scores! There's 100+ of these games, so you're in for hours of fun and hard work! And the biggest, and greatest change, is that you don't even need to be at your friends house in order to whoop him at that game of Warlords! Yup, there's ONLINE MULTIPLAYER. Me and a buddy both got the collection and tried a game of Asteroids to see the lag issue, and I can safely say there were no problems on either end. It's seamless, and it works perfectly.Controllers are no problem, either! like using a Mouse and Keyboard? GO ahead! Xbox One controller? No problem! I spent a few minutes testing a bunch of controllers I had, including the Keyboard, Mouse, Xbone controller, A U-TRAK Arcade Trackball for Missile Command (Just for that authenticity, and my Very own USB Arcade stick, and ALL WORKED FLAWLESSLY. No input lag, not even on the trackball which I was worried about the most!OVERALL: Guys, even if you're a Gaming Veteran like me, or even a gamer starting fresh and new, this has fun to be had. It's One hell of a collection that I myself, am glad Atari brought over.			"

												Come to relive the classics, stick around for 3D Tic Tac Toe and Video Pinball!No course in the history of video games would be complete without this collection of games.  As you play each game you'll recognize bits and pieces that helped shape the games we play today.  Personally, as an old fart gamer, I remember each and every one of these.  I played them all for hours on end.  I know for you young pups it's hard to understand how anyone could spend hours playing most of these games but in their time they were the most awesome games ever!!So what do you get for your hard earned money here.  Well you get 100 classic Atari games.  A handful of them are Arcade versions but the greater majority of them are Atari 2600 games.  Controls are a bit funky but they were with that Atari joystick that we had to keep taking apart and fixing all the time too.  There's certainly some standout games like Asteroids, Centipede, Missile Command, Tempest, and Crystal Castles.  There's some seriously retro ones for you game historians that want to say you've played the earliest of games like Pong, Breakout, Outlaw, and Combat.  Then there's a host of ones that have been forgotten Yar's Revenge, Sword Quest, and Haunted House.  I think there's literally something for everyone in this package, if you like seriously retro games.Trouble is, most of them you'll end up playing long enough to remember the game or see what it was like, then never play it again because the new games have so much more shiny lights.  There are however a handful of games on here that might keep you coming back.  3D Tic Tac Toe is an awesome game in concept.  When I told my 20 year old son about it (he'd never even heard of it) and explained how to win he asked why nobody ever picked up that game again and remade it.  For all you pinball fans out there you have to try Video Pinball.  I think it was one of the very first video versions of pinball ever.  I remember literally sitting for hours playing the same game.  If memory serves me correctly I maxed out the score once.  BTW pro-tip on that one, you can nudge the table and it's helps, a lot......  Checkers, Chess, and Combat might be fun to play online or locally with friends.At the end of the day it really depends on who you are and what your gaming tastes are when determining if you should get this one or not.  If modern graphics and depth of gameplay are super important to you then I'd say don't get this.  If you hate grinding or repetitive gameplay then you probably shouldn't get this.  However, if you love retro games, seeing where your modern games started from, or are an old fart like me that wants to relive a little of the old days of gaming this is a great gem and should be in your collection.  Personally, I love it and recommend it.  Your mileage may vary.			"

												AWESOMENESS HAS LANDED , Surround and Space War 2600 , (especially DOCKING aka Space Shuttle) , 2 of the greatest 2 player games ever made , YAY !!! YES !!! with online multiplayer ^^ are the icing on a HUGE cake ! Space War note : forward is thrust , left and right are for steering only . ""Shared"" option on Docking is by far the best  NOTE: Getting the settings wrong can impair your 2600 game experiences / if you think you can think outside the box , try playing Surround with ""wrap"" on / Space War is mostly better with ""wrap"" on , and ""sun"" on can liven up simple battles. DEVS HAVE FIXED initial control issues so just buy it please to swell the numbers available for multiplayer - ok can we have Williams/Midway Vault next please ?			"

												If you enjoyed the classic Atari acrade games and the subsequent 2600 console cartridge games, you'll love this collection.    It carries a lot of nostalgia with it and brings back a lot of great memories.  Works perfect with both my Steam controller and my XBox 360 controller.  Nice customization options under the hood.  Hopefully, other publishers like Midway, Capcom, Techmo, Taito, and Activision will follow suit and release their classic arcade and console collections in a similar manner.Note:  Overall, I've found that the games in the collection work better with a Steam controller than an XBox 360 controller.

UpdateEdit: Since an update came out to issue black screen/control issues present on release for some, I have to mention that here. So if you read a review writing about control issues, be aware that most of them are patched already.PingEver wondered if could you play Pong against one of your friends online? Loved watching Sega Fanboy Mark of Classic Game Room playing Centipede and Missile Command and eagered to do the same? Well, now you can. And it would be a huge mistake not to do that.Atari Vault brings you hours of fun. In the last two hours I realized how I suck at Breakout, still it's fun to suck at it. A great collection of Atari 2600 and Arcade cabinet games for a fair price.The devs did a good job here. You can play two-player games online with a friend, however, you should know that there's not a large chance to just find an online game with some random folk to play with, so you have to discuss it in advance.There are only a dozen of achievements, but when you get them you can feel like you really achieved something. Even if it doesn't seem so by just reading their description. Like ""Clear a screen in Super Breakout"". Doesn't sound too hard, does it? How hard can it be to clear a screen in a breakout game? Well, it is. So you'll find a good challenge here.PongPros:A great collection with nice emulation and a lots of funNo FPS-lock (sadly it has to be mentioned)Steam Controller support!!! With different pre-set profiles for the games.Leaderboards and achievementsOnline playGreat menu musicIt has a neon grid intro. Neon is the future! Or at least it was in the 80s!You have an Atari logo on your screen when you start it. At that very moment you already feel it worth the price!Be aware:The graphics options are a little bit ""barebone"", all you have is resolution, bezel art on/off and vector emulation style. However, the latter is a nice touch!The main menu is not too intuitive to navigateUnless hundred thousands of people buys this, be aware that you need someone if you want to play online. I don't think there would be a great chance to just hang out and wait until someone plays Pong with you. It's sad, but multiplayer CoD is somewhat more popular than multiplayer Pong.Bonus CitySure, the graphics in the 70s and early 80s weren't that good, and the games looks simpler in today's standard. Still they give you a great challenge and hours of fun. Get it if you can enjoy a game without fancy 3D. Then feel rad when you spend hours playing Super Breakout on your $2000 gaming rig. :)			"

Posted: March 26, 2016
												This is a review specifically for people who are intending to play this on a arcade cabinet, in which case, DONT GET IT.The game states it has full controller support, I bought this game to play on an arcade cabinet and is causing many issues with its stick and button configuration using a JAMMA style configuration. IT ONLY NEEDS A JOYSTICK AND 3 BUTTONS and the 2 gamepads with a joystick and 8 buttons each apparently isn't enough!!Issues I came accros within 20 minutes:-Player 1 and 2 are swapped with no way to change the order.-The UI interface is not allowing me to use the joystick to navigate and is asking for a D-Pad that does not exists forcing me to connect a keyboard and mouse.-The button configuration does not allow me to to change what button starts a game, it wants the Xbox Start button which does not exist on the JAMMA arcade controllers attached to the cabinet. so the only way is to connect a keyboard and hit esc to start.-It crashes about every 5 minutes.-Half of the games I tried did not work because they required a D-Pad instead of the joysticks for what ever reason.-The menu's often freak out and don't allow selections to be made after swapping menus a couple times making it impossible to switch off the side options panel until restarting the application.-Some of the games simply don't load, it just silently closes the application.This makes me extraordinarily sad because I was extremely excited to run this on my arcade cabinet and play these amazing games. Hopefully they will either fix these issues, or I will have to wait for a different developer to make a similar application that actually works the way it should.			"

			Atari Vault Steam keys can be grabbed at over half price though♥♥♥♥♥at https://www♥♥♥♥♥com/r/atarivault ... Today is 24th March 2016.		

Powered up. Saw Atari logo, expected the worst. Instantly p*ssed myself with excitement after realising you can spin virtual arcade cabinets around.Calmed down. Played Centipede. Got addicted. Went to change trousers.Checked out Atari 2600 section. Drank pint of water in excitement at seeing you could spin the original game boxes around.. AND READ THE MANUALS.. P*ssed myself again.Played Tempest on the 2600. Was amazed at how much tweaking you can do to the controls, and the entire general slick presentation of the package.Came to wright this review, and rehydrate. Based on what I've seen and played so far, would wholly recommend. Well done Atari. One thing though guys... No ET?			"

												Atari Vault collection is some of the greatest games the 2600 platform offered and it doesn't disappoint. Upon first loading I intended a quick 5min look, 2hrs later I was still glued to my screen. ""They don't make them like they used to"". While some other packs might nickle and dime, Atari provides great value for money with a well arranged group of classics. Some may only entertain a few minutes for nostalgia sake but I can all but guarantee others should keep you coming back for more. Personally I feel there's enough to justify the price with the included 'arcade/cab' games.Few things that made it stand out was UI. Both clean and quick to navigate with some well thought out categories. Most games instantly loaded and I was able to drop back to the main screen without troubles. Didn't have many issues with controls but I agree with some other recommendations in saying rebindable options for certain games would be nice. What impressed me most was the overall 'performance' and when I say this I mean how things looked on modern screens. Often when emulating older games I've run into issues with screen tearing and otherwise. Not only was it smooth but currently using a 120hz panel that some modern games have had issues with. Inclusion of leaderboards and local/online multiplayer for many of the games is just the icing on the cake. Atari Vault gets my recommendation as one of the best retro collections on steam and is well worth checking out or adding to your wishlist.

												I still despise Atari for their actions against Jeff Minter and TxK (seriously, you and Jeff would make a good partnership, given the correct circumstances. TxK really should be out on Steam by now, especially after the lack of quality games by Atari as of recent.).But this, Atari Vault, is a very nice compilation of classic games regardless. Used to play the old collection on the PS1, but the controller made it hard for me sometimes. Using a mouse here probably is more comfortable, especially on games like Tempest, Centipede, and Super Breakout. (Shame that Battlezone didn't make it, but oh well.)Worth getting during a sale.			"

												Excellent collection of 2600 titles as owned by Atari. The arcade titles feel limited but are spot on in quality. Also to play Red Baron and Asteroids in this condition is a dream.  It appears to have some homebrew since one 2600 game dated to 89. Combat is awesome in multiplayer online. I am planning on getting a steam controller to find out how well arcade Centipede works. But as far as the emulation goes this is top notch. It s about the same as the Atari collection on the Ipad but with multi controller support and other features it is a great improvement. I will choose this over mame anyday.			"

												If I knew that Skiing, Pac Man, and Space Invaders weren't included, I would not have purchased the Atari Vault, other than that Atari Vault is pretty spot on when it comes to nostalgia, gameplay and overall recreation of the old Atari home system. Any one born just after 1970 should still have these games in a drawer somewhere. If you are a millenium you may, be it a small chance, enjoy these old time pixel games that ignighted a video game revolution that still persists to this day.

												I have played Pong in multiplayer. This is heaven.First, sorry for my english :)This bundle interface is pretty well done with the 3d visualization of games boxes and even arcade machines in simplified 3d models that you can turn around. You can kind of navigate in the menus with an Xbox360 controller, sometimes I had to use the mouse, but probably because I missed all what I can do with the controller, I guess. Nostalgia at its best, in a modern presentation. You can host a multiplayer game or join some, probably more for friends than randoms, because there won't be thousands, even hundreds, playing them in multi or hosting a game and waiting for someone...I've bought it for Breakout and Yars Revenge (it was a blast playing it again!).I would recommend it for a nostalgic trip only, not every old good Atari games are there but there is enough for a couple of nights trying some. If you don't understand them, there is scanned manuals that you can read and zoom. I would have liked modernized manuals instead of scanned ones, because sometimes the fonts are hard to read.*Note: the problems in the paragraph below don't exist anymore, since they patched the game and controls so it's way better*There are some games that either with keyboard, mouse or Xbox360 controller, the contols don't feels right. Especially Breakout, the paddle feels like mouse acceleration effect, not very good. But this is saved because there is other games... I read somewhere that they recommend the Steam controller, but anyway I would say be aware that you can have some frustrations with some controls in certain games.You have a leaderboard for 17 of the 18 arcade games ( Pong have no ""score"").I have bought this on another website and it included 20 Intellivision games pack and 40 Colecovision games pack, so I could not be disapointed with Atari Vault price for sure. It worths what Atari games are inside are worth to you. :)			"

												I purchased Atari Vault only for the arcade games.  The initial release was unplayable, but there have been two major updates that have improved the product greatly.  Any reviews prior to update 1.0.2 are obsolete.For Missile Command and Millipede, there is still a significant issue with the trackball control in that if you roll the trackball fast and let go, the object that you are controlling with the trackball will sail too far resulting in imprecise control.    I have tried to change the settings for the mouse in Windows 10 OS to a slower movement, but this did not help.  There is a ""follow mouse"" option, which annoyingly shows the image of the cursor, and is therefore worthless.Fortunately, the trackball works fine as a surrogate spinner in Tempest, Pong, and Super Breakout.  Tempest has a cheat mode that allows the game to start at any bonus level without the need to earn the level, just like in Atari Anniversary.The games that use only buttons, including Asteroids, Asteroids Deluxe, Space Duel, and Gravitar, are perfect as far as I can tell.  Asteroids Deluxe even has the option to hide the background.There are other emulators, such as Atari Anniversary, Atari 80 Classic Games in One, and others, that for the most part handle the trackball issue better than Atari Vault, although Missile Command in Atari Anniversary moves the site in a diamond when you move the trackball in a circle.The developer is very responsive to feedback and is courteous.  Issues with the trackball notwithstanding, I still highly recommend Atari Vault, because Tempest, Asteroids, Asteroids Deluxe, Space Duel, Gravitar, and Black Widow are awesome and work perfectly or essentially perfectly, the developer is committed to Atari Vault, and because most of the other emulators will not work on Windows 10.  Hopefully with enough support, this fine developer will bring more Atari games and perhaps arcade games from other companies to Steam.I love the music in the intro.I nominated this game for the ""test of time"" award.  Unfortunately it has been some time since the developer has posted.			"

												While the job that the developers have done is very admirable in bringing back authentic replica versions of every arcade and Atari 2600 console game in this collection, for me.. a kid who grew up loving these games..All of these games have aged considerebly since I loved them so much back in the early 80's.  For almost every game here, there are probably dozens of games that do it better in every way for FREE available online.If you are wanting to buy this to try and re-create all the fun and joy you remember having playing these games back in the 80's, like I was hoping for.. you might feel disappointed.  However, if you go in understanding that this collection will really only hold a significant value as ""nostalgia"", then it might be worth the price.I used to be a Missile Command and Arcade Asteroids fan back in the day.. but this collection while true to the original games just didn't have anywhere near the same appeal today.  This collection was a refund for me, with the possibility of picking it up again if it goes on sale at 50% to 80% off.. should that ever happen.Hope this helps someone make a choice while not making too many people shy away from a purchase.  ..Remember that you always have 2 weeks and 2 full hours of game time to refund this collection if you decide the value isn't there, just like I did.

												Very good compilation of games, but could use a few more. Would be awesome if Atari could work with some other rights holders to make an expansion pack including other famous games from the 70s/80s that they didn't publish/develope themselves.I only have 2 gripes. My favorite of all, Warlords seems to be majorly glitched. I can't even play the game it's so bad. I will start, and no matter which corner I choose, the computer players just don't respond... so I'm essentially playing a multiplayer game solo. The weird thing is when I hold down the action button to hold the fireball, if the fireball is on a computer shield, the computer shield will hold it, like I'm somehow controlling the computer players. It makes no sense and I don't know how they could have screwed up the game so badly. It also sucks that there's no forums for this game, so I doubt this will ever get fixed, unless another player can give me a fix/workaround?2nd problem is that, while the game includes multiplayer...every single time I've tried multiplayer, there are literally 0 other players on. And I try a bunch of the games. What good is multiplayer if nobody is using it? I know this isn't a game problem, it's a community problem, but still. Maybe I'm just trying on the wrong days/times? (I've tried weekdays/weekends+afternoon/night, really don't think the bulk would be playing mornings...) The game isn't even that old, so it's weird there isn't anybody in multiplayer. I want some good competition, but can't get it. I'd like to play competitively in Warlords, but there's nobody to play against and the game itself is broken lol.Despite all that, I will still recommend the game. Just be warned that one of the best games included is majorly glitched (to my knowledge the other 99 are fine), and if you are looking for a large multiplayer community, sadly this isn't the place. The menus and 3D cabinets/game boxes are all great to look at (some are a bit blurry), and there's a lot of promotional pieces from each game's heyday thrown in to check out as well which is really cool. There's good customization for each game, and the main menu has a nice, catchy electronic tune.If you are really into retro games, it's a great buy (moreso for the arcade games than Atari 2600), but if you only have passing interest, I'd say wait for a sale.

												Atari Vault is a collection of over 100 Arcade and Atari 2600 ranging from sports to blowing up asteroids in space. With this massive selection of games to choose from you will likely spent hours just trying all the games and staring at the included scans of the box art, arcade machine or cartridge for each title. It is both a love letter to those that loved the old Atari company and a great introduction to games of the past in one convenient package. These are quite clearly decade old games with no graphical improvements whatsoever so they will obviously look outdated and the only addition to the graphical presentation are some nifty borders unique to each game. The biggest feature to this collection of games is the ability to use controllers for each game and have custom bindings on a game per game basis which really helps keep you playing as you can fine tune to your liking and never worry about it again.  Most of the games had optimal controller bindings but games like Brickout or Warlords that require a paddle simply do not play well on a controller and makes precise movements much harder. Along with the controller you can use either mouse or keyboard which can also be rebinded however you please. For games that were originally for the paddle using the mouse is really the only way to properly play them if you plan on being any good at them. Now highscores have much more reach than bragging in your local arcades hangout as each game has their own leaderboards to compete against your friends or people around the world. The second biggest feature of this compilation is the ability to play with your friends or random people online though I was sadly unable to use this feature over the course of four days testing as no one plays online. You can be the host and try to set up a match while still being able to play games which is nice but without a community it is kind of pointless. Hopefully it gathers a following in the future but if you are looking for online play you will need to find a friend with this title as of now.  While the games themselves have no improvements I was pleasantly surprised to see the Atari Vault running at 2560x1440p @ 165hz. It makes little to no real difference in the games but it's always nice to have it running at your monitors native resolution and not locked at 1080p 30fps like so many modern games. With Arcade games you can change the lives, difficulty and various other factors while the Atari 2600 games require you to first boot up the game before being able to change anything. It's a nifty little selection screen that is a far better alternative than getting up, flicking the “game select” switch on the console and wondering just what it did if you no longer had a manual. For those that don't know, most Atari 2600 games had multiple modifications to the core gameplay that you could choose from in order to keep the game from getting stale. It also retains the Atari 2600's feature of being able to choose whether to display in color or in black and white if you so choose.  100 games is quite a lot of content no doubt but keep in mind that these are very old games where the point of them is to play for fun or for the highscore. It is primitive compared to today's games and most don't even have music, only bleeps and bloops. With that out the way they are still as fun to play now as they were back then. Even without the realistic graphics and captivating soundtracks of modern games there is still something immensely charming about a pure focus on gameplay and sound effects so primitive that you can't help but kick back and relax. These are the type of games you'd play when you are short on time and want some quick fun. Get in intense dogfights in the Red Baron, continue to suck at Centipede and out drive bandits in Fatal Run all before work or school. With 97 more games to try out and plenty of them having different modifiers to the gameplay you’re bound to find a couple of games that will have you hooked and wanting to make your way up the leaderboard. Atari Vault is definitely a must buy title if you have fond memories of playing Atari's 2600 console or arcade machines and a perfect title for those wondering what gaming was like back then.			"

												Nic Reviews #2:This is a really fun game, dont get me wrong. But it has some problems that are evident. 1. too many dud games.    there is just way to much junky games, and not enough fun games, or arcade ports. Atari shouldve talked to Namco or Midway, and try to get some of there 2600 and Arcade ports onto here. 2. there are not 100 games here. over 30 of the games are ports of the arcade versions of the games. so your getting 2 centipeds, asteroids, missile command, and others. so whne u buy this, keep in mind that yr not getting 100 games.3. The ""Museum"" part of this doesnt wokr very well. In this game, u can look at the manual and stuff, or promotional stuff. well, when u try to look at a manual, it barely works, getting broken up, and is hard to read. other than that, this is a really fun compilation of games. if u want an arcade fix at home on steam, this is what u should get it.

												I am an old school kind of guy. I bought the Atari Vault for one reason and one reason only: to play Centipede.  While I am sure the game is using the original programming it doesn't work very well with either a game controller, mouse, or trackball (which is my preferred method of control for this game). My character keeps moving after I've completely stopped the trackball. This is different than the arcade unit where the shooter would stop immediately and makes it almost impossible to achieve the level of accuracy needed to play the game well. I implore the developers to fix this and allow the game to be played as it was intended.			"

YouTube™ Video: Atari Vault (PC) - Retro Flashback 

			Views: 796		

			Buy Atari Vault from Green Man Gaming and help suppor the channel: http://gmg.pxa.ca In this episode of Retro Flashback, I do another deep dive into a recent retro collection.		

Whether or not you're going to be into Atari Vault comes principally down to your personal taste in retro games. If you want to experience some of the oldest entries in the Atari arcade and 2600 catalogues, you've come to the right place. If you want to experience what many consider the best games on those two platforms, maybe not so much.The package of Atari Vault itself is largely excellent. Code Mystics specialises in bringing retro games to modern systems and they did a great job here. The emulation is excellent, the presentation of the menus and the bezel artwork is well done and there are a bunch of visual historical extras you can look at, though the scan quality varies. All the games that support two players have full local multiplayer capabilities and to my great surprise, online play! I have no idea how well it works as I unfortunately couldn't find any games. The arcade titles also have online leaderboards which is a very nice value add.The controller support is a bit of a let down. Controllers are indeed supported and you can remap the buttons to boot but navigating the menus with a controller is clumsy and unintuitive and there's really no reason for it. You'll often find yourself getting frustrated trying to figure out how to get them to pick the thing you want. For a collection that begs to be played on a TV, this is kind of ridiculous. This can definitely be patched and I hope it is.As for the games, they're some of Atari's oldest offerings. Many of the arcade games are vector based and look quite good, plus Code Mystics added some options to adjust the vector display intensity. Some true classics like Tempest, Major Havoc, Asteroids, Crystal Castles and more are in this lineup and they play quite well for the most part. This is the part that really impressed me. The Atari 2600 line is decidedly more of a let down for me. There's some gems in there like Yar's Revenge but to me, most of the best 2600 games came from third parties like Activision and this being an Atari published package, you aren't going to find those here. Many first party Atari 2600 games haven't aged well at all and if you really are gushing with nostalgia for them, you'll find them pretty rough to play and largely uninteresting.Overall, this is a very nicely put together package that's had more effort put into it than many others. Whether or not you like the games on offer is going to be down to what you like so take a look at the list first and make sure it's what you want before putting down money. If you are into those games though, there's no better way to play them.			"

												I was on the fence for a long time with this one because of the mixed reviews, but in the end I'm glad I made the decision to buy it. Yes, it doesn't contain Pitfall, or Skate Boardin', or Space Invaders, or Pacman. Those games aren't owned by Atari, and the developers have made that clear in the discussion forums. They also provide a comprehensive list of which games ARE included, so if the game you want isn't on there, don't buy it then whinge it's not included. They've done their best with what they could get, and it is remarkably comprehensive.Frankly, it's worth full price for Yar's Revenge. It's still staggering how the same programmer could be responsible for both the best game for the system (Yar) and the worst (ET) but I guess that's just how things go. Combat is just as much fun as it's always been. Adventure is interesting, if perhaps a little overambitious for the hardware but it still does it's best (Check out the Intellivision game of the same name for a really good early exploration game). Circus is wonderfully bizarreAnd of course, you also get the arcade classics of Asteroids, Centipede, Crystal Castles, Missile Command, Pong, Super Breakout and Tempest (MUCH better than the Star Wars games).That's only scratching the surface. I'm not much one for sports games but I'm sure I'll check them out at some point...but that's already 11 brilliant games for your money. Yes, it would be nice to have other games you remember from your childhood...they might appear in the Namco Vault or the Activision Vault or whatever at some point, but there's nothing the current license holders can do about it.As for the implementation? Seems to be just about flawless. You can customise your controls and the display, response time seems good, and the menu is fairly easy to navigate. I'm not sure if they're just ROMs running under emulators...a couple of things in the arcade games suggested they're running something based on MAME, but does it really matter as long as it works? Having the original bezels, cabinet pictures, box artwork and manuals are a bonus, even if the scan resolution is a bit small at times.Oh, and THANK YOU for a Linux version!The only thing I don't really understand is why the installation is 1.1Gb given most of these games are 4-16k in size...

												My experience with Atari Vault is that the games which use trackball do not track correctly.  Tempest is one game where I've seen this, apparent slippage in the tracking which results in delayed movement, or no movement even though I'm moving the ball.  Also, I'd like to see the tracking made reversable between positive and negative movement on horizontal and vertical plains, once the tracking accuracy issue is resolved.  Thank you.			"

												I have got to say that this collection brings back a LOT of memories. :) I used to own an Atari 2600 and had over 50 carts for it and some of my favorites were Combat, Yar's Revenge, Adventure, etc. I picked up this collection for iPad and Android as well but the Steam version is REALLY nice to be able to play on my 32'' TV. If you're an old school gamer, you will NOT be disappointed! :)			"

												I enjoy some retro and arcade games and use Linux Mint as my main OS so this emulator ticks these two boxes. Great collection of games for the price (I bought it on sale) and works very well on a Lenovo computer from 2011 running Linux with integrated Intel HD Graphics 2000.			"

												The best Atari compilation to date! The emulation is smooth, the controls are good, the games play great and the game selection is really good. The only problem is that there's no Battlezone but then again, Rebellion bought the rights to Battlezone so Atari can't use the IP anymore (which probably explains why Sprint 2 is in there instead). Overall, this game is definately worth the $20 I've spent on it and you should definately get it if it's on sale.			"

												100 games, but they are mostly ones we have seen before in other collections.  The presentatoon is slick and pleasing with 3D rendered boxes and cabinets looking sharper tha n ever before.The online multi-player is what wil lset this title apart from any previous ones.  Dozens of the game can be played online, and it really breathes new life into old classics.  Games like Combat! Outlaw, Surround,  Bowling, Basketball, and even 3D Tic Tac Toe feel new and vibrant when playing against online foes.  I have not enjoyed these games this much in 30 years.There are few bugs though.  Some games offer multiplayer whre there is no multi-player to be had (i.e. Basic Math). Also, games exit out abruptly and don't let you see the final score.  This is espcially apparent in mutli-player games where there is no option to rematch or replay, and the game ends before you can even see who won.  However, even with this issue,s it's a great package and shows a lot of promise if Atari can keep it going.   For an update/DLC/version 2.0 I'd suggest adding any Lynx games Atari has the rights for, as the Comlynx games would play well here.  Also, any classic 8-bit Computer games would be nice, including Star Raiders, Caverns Of Mars, etc. Ditto for 5200 and 7800 games.    Also, 2-player cpin-ops like X's and o's Atari football would be awesome to play online. "

												The games themselves are indeed the classics but two player controllers can be problematic to set up. The arcade classics are true to the originals and really give the 70s and 80s game vibe. The classic Adventure for Atari 2600 is included and it is still just as fun as it was in the 70's. That is: it is a blast and if you haven't played it, you should give it a go. I would buy this for that game alone.			"

												I've played a lot of old Atari collections and this is one of the crazier ones. It's a pretty broad selection with several 3D arcade games I've heard about, but never played. For example, Major Havok is an insane genre mashup and is seriously worth checking out to see how ahead of its time it was. Some games are hillariously bad simulations or brain teaser quests that require you to read the manuals (which are included).The UI is weird and bubbly, but does a nice job of labelling all the mode selection. Mouse input does ok for replacing paddle wheel controlls, but doesn't feel right in the trackball games. Overal a very well tought out and excellent preservation of the good and the bad.			"

												A great compilation but without proper controls it's just not worth it. These games were meant to be played with original hardware...paddles and joysticks. While I found the controls to be ok and solid for most games other games were pretty much unplayable (mainly the paddle oriented games).The pricetag is also IMO slightly above what I really ended up getting but that is a matter of ones own personal financial situation and opinion etc.Overall, I'm glad these are released now and then on Steam or consoles but I can hardly recommend this for PC users where emulation for the whole experience can be had for free and sometimes done a whole lot better. Also, try hooking up and original Atari 2600, the gameplay will always be better with real hardware.			"

												TLDR; Poor selection, weird glitches, and lack of compelling features make this one a meh. Full steam controller support is nice, though.First, almost all of the 2600 games are shovelware while most of the ones you hope for are missing due to licensing. You don't get River Raid, but you do get... Concentration. Yay. The nice part is that every game comes with the original manual/flyer. It's really awesome to look over this classic stuff. You can also look at the full boxes for the 2600 games and the cabinets for the arcade titles. The manuals for the 2600 games are especially important, as you'll have to read most of them before playing the game. They might be simple, but they are NOT intuitive. But that little bit aside, it's a disappointing collection. Weird resolution options, game glitches, and lack of display options hold it back. It does keep things at the right ratio by including nice bezel art, but why the lack of screen filters? Why make me select the options for the 2600 at a menu instead of flipping switches on a 2600 itself? That would have been an awesome touch! "

												This is the best Atari colection yet-surpassing the greatest hits collections of the past.  The emulation is more accurate than previous attempts and the HD display configurations really make for a crisp look.  It's hard to go wrong with a collection of 100 games such as this.  at $20 or less.  That said, I hope the following items will be patched soon:-Some of the sounds are still off, emulation wise.  My prime examples include Major Havoc, Black Widow, and on the 2600 side, Circus Atari (how you can mess up the sounds on that one, I do not know).-Trackball/paddle control.  Horribly innacurate and imprecise.  Not sure how the Steam controller works with it, but it can't be much better than the actual mouse.  -Since emulators can do the controls and sounds more justice, you would think that a collection you're paying money for would be able to do them at least as well. This is still, by a wide margin ,the best compilation you're going to find on Steam, and better than any previous Atari collection yet seen.  Hopefully we'll see an Activision (2600) collection on here soon as well.			"

												If you loved the old arcades (you're over 40!) then this is great because of the simplicity of Steam integration - no more messing with malware-ridden emulators. However, please note that there are only 18 proper classic arcade titles - the other 82 are from the Atari 2600 which is way too basic for my tastes.The menus, layout & control config are simple & reliable, and the global hiscores are welcome.Two issues so far: there's no VSYNC or frame limiter option, which is just plain stupid, and the second time I run a game the display is shifted towards the bottom.Recommended, but only just, and then only to encourage further development. If the publisher made many more decent arcade games available within this Steam wrapper I'd happily throw money at them. "

												Atari Vault includes many nice vintage arcade games. This game is fun to play for me at least. I like to play simple vintage games with not too many controls, and they can be played in short stints too. It is great to have these arcade classics to play with modern computer.Quality of the conversions of these games seems really good, although I haven't played the original games. 18 original Atari arcade cabinet games included was the main reason for me to buy this game and the games of Atari 2600 are a great bonus.Arcade cabinets show up as a copy of the actual cabinet with original artwork. With Atari 2600 games there is original gameboxes and original manuals, and when you are playing a game there is original switches of Atari 2600 computer.			"

												I have a Tempest and a Centipede machine in my basement. Next to them is a real Atari 2600 with many of these games. Anything I'm missing, I can play in an emulator. Even so, it's really nice to have all these games wrapped up in a nice package.Still, this package could use some work yet. I have a Steam Controller, and this takes great advantage of it: Every game within the vault has its own tab in the controller settings, so you can customize per game.But, some of the controls are buggy. Playing Black Widow, hitting Fire Down always seems to trigger the Menu instead. Playing Tempest, I can't quite seem to get the sensitivity right when playing with a mouse.Even with the bugs, though, I don't regret buying this at all. A few tweaks, and this is perfect!			"

												Fun for the whole Family! (of 1 or 2)  :PThe good:Most Games appear to be playable. (Haven't tried them all yet)Contains the game manuals and box art for the 2600's gamesA good buy for anyone not wanting to jump through hoops to play old Atari games. (Less than 10U$D in my region, otherwise maybe wait for sale)The chosen games are fun (the ones I have tried)Able to customise keyboard and mouse controls for EACH gameThe Unknown:There is an online multiplayer function that I haven't tried, nor can I be bothered to try. It's an interesting idea and I appreciate it. But playing Atari games locally with a second player is more fun as you can laugh at each other failing at retro games and the keyboard/mouse controls (which probably don't hold a candle to the original controls like steering wheels ...)The Bad:Would be nice to offer updated graphical reimaginings of the original games as a display option, like the Atari classics collection on PSP. (not sure what it's called, but it was a solid game with good design)Apparently won't work with ""arcade controllers"" according to hardcore fan who tried to put this in an arcade cabinet.  Doesn't have Battlezone. Red Baron is fun, but Battlezone is a great game that should not have been left out.No E.T. or Indiana Jones for the masochists.DLC anyone?Conclusion:It has a nice interface to choose the games from at main menu. Box arts and manuals are nice. Games are fun. Multiplayer is good idea if it works. BUY if you just want something to play while waiting for the next Hitman 2016 episode to come out, or if you're like me, spend that some that large sum of money you got from your Hitman refund when you found out about the always online DRM policy.BUY NOT if you already have a source for the original game files and you can get them running on modern or retro hardware of your choice			"

												Wow.  An awesome blast from the past and a great opportunity to introduce my kids to the games that are still crazy fun to play.  And I'm loving the inclusion of the gallery art and manuals.  Great detail.  I hope this sparks other additions or releases from other companies.  How about some Defender and Joust?My only complaint is around multi-player.  It would be great if it kept you in-game after ending.  Then you can easily play another 2-player match.  Right now we have to host and invite again for every single round. "

												Someone wrote a review that its only Atari 2600 games - not true. I'm not sure where they even got this from as when you first launch it the default is to browse about 25 or so custom/classic Atari arcade games. They are great and play just like the original - just need some pizza, beer and some friends :).On the 2600 games - I admit I never was a huge fan of them (even though the system came out when I was a kid) - they play as expected. Interestingly enough - the collection doesn't include ET. I guess not even Atari could stomach that one again.			"

												Although it was nice to see Lunar Lander, it doesn't work well with the Steam controller. The throttle is twitchy on the right pad, which leads to a crash. Even more depressing is that the ONE game I was hoping to see wasn't there... Why didn't you include BATTLEZONE?  It was put on the Atari Arcade Hits CD released for PC many years ago, so how hard would it have been to add it to this release?			"

												Deflinitely one for those with the nostaliga of gaming in the 80's.  The claim of 100 games is a little loose, but that said still good value for money.A lot of the games port well to the PC and the controller (I think a game controller is pretty much a must have), but unfortunately a few port very badly.  Back in the day you had analogue controllers with dials on them to adjust bat position in games like pong and breakout.  Unfortunately this doesn't translate well to a modern controller and the speed sensitivity is terrible.  There's a few games of this style on the compilation and they fall into one of two categories, either the bat moves so slow it's unplayable, or the bat moves so fast, it's unplayable.Moving past that you'll find some true gems, a few versions of asteroids, some truly unique arcade hits like Gravitar and Black Widow as well as yes another version of asteroids called space wars (we got colours).  Classics like Crystal Castle port very well and are pretty much as addictive today as they were.So in short, do all games port well?  NO.Is there enough that it's worth the money?  YES in my opinion as I'm a fan of many of these games from the 70's and 80's.You'll need to be patient, you'll need to learn how to play the games but they're still great fun the mechanics in many of them are sound and there's something soulful in playing the predescessor to modern RPG's, Adventure.

												Most of the other Atari collections have come up short, but this one seems to be comprehensive, and done with attention to detail. For instance, you select the different games by rotating through a lineup of either the arcade cabinets or video game boxes, both being historically accurate. There's also included scans of the instructions, and nice touches like being able to select between a modern options menu, and one that looks like the Atari 2600 switches (nice bit of nostalgia).If there's any downside, it's that this doesn't really capture the range & quality of the Atari 2600 library, but in all fairness, that's due to the fact that these are all games made by Atari, rather than 3rd party licensed games like ones from Activision (which was an *entirely* different kind of company back then). I'm obviously not faulting them for this, but I am naturally inclined to want to play those games now. That said, the game selection is really the best that Atari had to offer, and it's a fantastic lineup.It was easy to get sucked in by the gameplay of classic arcade titles such as Centapede & Asteroids. It goes to show the appeal that action-arcade games had back in the 70's & 80's of very short, but fast paced intensity that uses a risk vs. reward system to encourage your skill level to determine your score. Speaking of which, there are leaderboards, both local & worldwide, so you can see how terrible your skills of deterriated from age... Or maybe that's just me. Either way, this is a collection heavy on the nostalgia put together in a nice package. Worth picking up!			"

My game gets lag when the menu and everything pops up but the actaul games work fine. Ummmm id say 5/10. It lacks alot of better games for example Berzerk which is my favorite on the actual Atari 2600. Id say buy it if you are into these kinds of games.			"

												This is amazing! Definitely worth buying.I never gre up in the 70s 80s or 90s so never had any of these classic games but I still had my experiences with 2d pc games and nintendo ds and ps2. I now have a huge obsession with classic games and bit genres and chiptune music. This hits perfectly for me as it is hard to get proper classics liek these and the ones you do find are remakes. not the same. when it is supplied by atari themselves however, it is the real thing and it all runs perfectly. great controls system compeltely re bindable. You can rotate the arcade machines and boxes and read every detail on them. also see all the old articles and posters of their releases and read the full original box manuals of all the atari 2600 games.There is no Atari E.T included but I think we can all guess why. Still would be fun to try though.Has best classics like original pong and asteroids and breakout and many more great ones!Definitely reccomend buying!11/10			"

												This is the best Atari colection yet-surpassing the greatest hits collections of the past.  The emulation is more accurate than previous attempts and the HD display configurations really make for a crisp look.  It's hard to go wrong with a collection of 100 games such as this.  at $20 or less.  That said, I hope the following items will be patched soon:-Some of the sounds are still off, emulation wise.  My prime examples include Major Havoc, Black Widow, and on the 2600 side, Circus Atari (how you can mess up the sounds on that one, I do not know).-Trackball/paddle control.  Horribly innacurate and imprecise.  Not sure how the Steam controller works with it, but it can't be much better than the actual mouse.  -Since emulators can do the controls and sounds more justice, you would think that a collection you're paying money for would be able to do them at least as well. This is still, by a wide margin ,the best compilation you're going to find on Steam, and better than any previous Atari collection yet seen.  Hopefully we'll see an Activision (2600) collection on here soon as well.			"

												Let me specify the obvious, this isn't for everyone. If you consider yourself a retro gamer, by what extent? Just because you like NES games, it doesn't mean you will like this. Atari is for those with nostalgia or with real appreciation of old school games. This compilation is quite massive. If you were to try and collect them all in real life, it would definitely be a spendy investment of both time and/or money. On paper, that makes it worth the $20. However, ask yourself before buying this an important question, how often do you actually plan to play this?While I feel majority of retro gamers prefer hard copies of the games they play since most of them are also collectors, I feel the few that don't care about having a hard copy also isn't above emulators. Illegal or not, lets not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t around, not a single god damn person on this planet is innocent of crimes. The real question comes down to whether or not you want this for the multiplayer or you're scared of lawyers knocking on your door. We all know if you really badly wanted to play these games on your PC, you were before they were officially sold on Steam. Don't lie. While you keep all of that in mind, I will list the game's strengths and just its strengths. The truth is, there isn't a whole lot to improve. I mean, they could implement save states, but most of these games don't really call for them. We could toss ideas all day about what could have been in the game, but they ultimately don't impact the review or warrants discussion in one. Truth is, this game is probably one of the best attempts on Steam when it comes to creating a playable collection of retro games. They did everything right, there is only nitpicks to be discussed. It has online play, it has steam features like trading cards and achievements (though the achievements is dreadfully lacking), and it has as many of each game versions as it possibly can (I wouldn't be surprised it has ALL of them, I don't actually know!). If you find yourself fancy of retro gaming, especially to this extent, and have some mates that also are down to some multiplayer, this is one of the best or even the best collections to date for old school Atari games. Let me warn you though, not all the games have multiplayer in the traditional sense. I haven't tried multiplayer since I have no friends that would fall under the retro gamer category, but I'm confident a lot of them are either turn based, players look at different screens to play their own take of the game, or they don't have multiplayer at all. Some do have same time multiplayer though and are fun, so don't be too alarmed by that. However, I would have enjoyed they ""modernized"" some games to allow two players on screen with slight adjustments.* Overall, despite the limited time I've played, I've seen enough to know it's a good purchase for the right people. I do not agree with the price tag, that was beyond ambitious. It is getting a thumbs up since it's a good game and delivered near perfectly on its goal. I suggest you wait for a sale or wait until you have a friend you know will binge through all the titles with you. It has local multiplayer, so perhaps you know someone in real life that will make the price tag more worth it.I'd give it somewhere around 7 or 8 /10Pros-Possibly the largest collection of *legal* retro games I have ever seen.Online capabilitySteam CardsCons-It could have been polished even better with more modern features as optionsIt's very pricey for what it really is. A lot of these games are not worth more than 10 cents anymore, so $20 for a hundred of them is a tad too ambitious. * I did not play online, so I could be wrong about them not adjusting online gameplay to modern standards, however I speculate they didn't based on previous installments of games like this and my experience with them. Please comment if I'm right or wrong.			"

												I purchased the Atari Vault because I'm a fan of Warlords. I used to play Warlords on the Atari 2600 with my sister and father many many years ago. We had 4 paddles. It was great fun. The three of could all play simultaneously.Playing warlords on the Atari vault is lacking. The mouse barely moves the sheilds in Warloards in both the arcade and 2600 version. Moving of the sheilds was originally done by paddle on the Atari 2600. A mouse doesn't work properly in Warlords. It barely moves the shield. Even it at it's at maximum setting. Playing warlords with keyboard doesn't cut it. The shield doesn't move fast enough. Warlords  can sort of be played with a joystick, but doesn't campare to what it was like playing it with the paddle.Super Break out somewhat well with a mouse and it set to it's maximum setting.Centipedes doesns't work well with mouse. You see the mouse cursor in the game and the centipede shooter follows it around. The mouse cursor is extremely distracing. You confuse it witht he centipede shooter.I do not reccomend the Atari vault for players who are getting it to play the paddle games.			"

Running it in it's native resolution would be nice as well as I owned an asteroids deluxe for a few years. also, the game freaks out if you try adjusting the resolutions. a glitch maybe?Graphical settings are malfunctioning. They need a patch. Game stil run really well.Still, I would recommend this for anyone looking for original atari games! the 2600 games are just the cherry on top.

												This Game was a disapointment, It would have been realy cool if they had the whole Atari 2600 game library, the controles was also to sensitive, and there were a few glitches with pong,  beside the few issues i guess it was fun but not as fun as i thought it would be. Better off buying an orginal Atari 2600 console off Amazon, nothing beats the classics, If your looking for an Atari game to play on steam i recomend shadow ops its a hidden gem ! :) I hope you guys enjoy the game though!

												This plays (barely) like a greatest hits of old classic Atari games, but it really lacks content.  There are so many games left out (mainly due to rights/legal issues) that it's like (for those of us that remember) going to some kid's house who only had a few games in their collection:Yar's Revenge?...................Sure.Asteroids? ........................ You bet.Video Pinball.....................  One of my favorites.Dodge em ........................  Yup... Another FavoriteBut where is Superman?  Star Wars? How about the old Imagic games?  How about the old crappy arcade ports (even the dreaded Pac Man)?And we all deserve to play the ultimate evil of retro gaming.... ET The Extra Terrestrial!Buy it on sale.

												I got this game to play with a friend of mine and while the package is great in terms of the games and presentation. On the arcade game side when we tried to play online it would work for about a minute and then the games wouild start to slow down to a crawl to the point where we needed to turn the game off. We tested a few arcade games and all gave us the same results. Crystal Castles we could make it to the second level and then it would start to slow down drastically.On the Atari 2600 it seems to work fine. My only complaint there is say for example in Combat or Combat 2 once the match was over it would kick us both out and disconnect the game forcing you to restart hosting the game and sending an invite. I tried to see if there was a port that needed to be opened but not finding one yet we put both machines in DMZ mode and still had the problem. We both ended refunding the game but we will repurchase if the multiplayer gets fixed.			"

												Analog controls work great now!Playing games with analog controls on a mouse or steam controller are a dream now. Tempest is quite a revelation. Default controls may need some tweaking, but with minimal effort, I get into an experience that feels addicting and seemless the way it should. Steam controller integration is impressive. Well done.Well worth the price, especially considering the addition of the Atari 2600 games, excellent stuff. From all the extra work they put in after the product was released, you can tell they wanted to make a definitive one-stop for all the classic Atari games we love with any control scheme, and I think they did that.

												This game made me so happy that my friend on skype noticed and said it was weird and out of character for me. I was playing this with a steam controller, which is absolutely amazing. I am very impressed with the depth and thought they put into the steam controller integration. Nearly every game has its own control configuration which you can customize yourself (although most are fine with the pre-made configuation), though some games (like warlords) just seem to not want to be controlled at all even with xbox 360 or mouse+keyboard.The detail goes even farther with images of all sides of arcade cabinets, and the boxes and manuals of the 2600 games. The best word I can use is ""charming"", but its also useful.My favorite thing about it is the online. Being able to scroll though a bunch of old games with someone on skype and saying ""lets play pong now, and then surround after that"" is just an amazing thing that I cant quite describeFor $9.99 its absolutely worth it, $19.99 is probably pushing it though. If you have a steam controller and like some classic games, its definitely up there near ""must own"" territory, especially during the sale			"

												Let's face it, there's nothing that will perfectly emulate that childhood feeling of holding an actual joystick that broke at the slightest twitch, playing Atari 2600 games on an old CRT TV, or those classic arcade machines. And no, those plug and play consoles don't come even close. However, the Atari Vault is the next best thing. Sure, it's not a woody Atari 2600 or a huge colorful arcade cabinet, but aside from a cool collection, would you really go through the hassle of playing some Centipede? I wouldn't, but I'd love to find out what happened to my old Atari console, and Atari in general. Among all the awful stuff they put out lately and the descending path they're on, the Atari Vault is a gem every gamer should have it in their library just to play some old stuff now and then, or show off to bratty kids who won't appreciate their CODs.There are a lot of games, 100 to be more specific, and I kinda ran through most of them in a frenzy, because yeah you can do that, and with ease, but I'd like to start a full gameplay of every each game from start to finish just like livin' the 80s. There are two main categories, arcades and 2600 home console, but there's also a list of categories sorted by genre. The colorful interface is snappy, the game screens looks totally rad and the menu music is jammin'. Sound is about right on par with the originals,at least as far as I remember, while the graphics are spot on, with the added feature of changing the visuals with three options, (paraphrasing) full screen, original ratio and CRT simulation. There's a lot to play with here and I hope there'll be more support for this compilation of beautiful old games.If there's one disappointing thing I have to point out is that there's no DigDug, which was a great game and really flashy for its time and those limitations.

												This could have been an amazing purchase with just a few tweaks.  Unfortunately many of the best titles are unplayable on my system.  For some reason the video on my system renders the ""line' based arcade games as a series of groups of intersecting hash marks, rather than as understandable objects - Asteroids, Lunar Lander, etc.  Also, I'm shocked by the titles which are ~not~ included in this package, many of my favorites:  Space Invaders, River Raid, Pitfall, Indiana Jones (to name just a few).  I'm surprised a title so recent would have video problems like this.  And the game selection is a missed opportunity.			"

												Great retro game package. Classic Atari arcade games from back in the day as they were... back in the day. Missile Command, Pong, Asteroids, Asteroids Deluxe, Black Widow, Red Baron, Crystal Castles, Centipede, Millipede, Tempest, Gravitar, Lunar Lander, Super Breakout, and more.  You can play the games with the cabinet art or without. Configurable controls for movement and firing button(s) were easy to set.  I had no problem configuring any of the controls to what I felt was comfortable for my style of playing.Another part of the game includes an emulator for the old Atari 2600 Game console.  There are too many games included in the repository of games to start naming them off but they have everything from Asteroids to Warlords. Well almost everything as I didn't find E.T.. The emulator feels like you are playing those old emulated games on the old Atari 2600. They did a great job bringing those old games back to life for a new era. These are not the old games redone. These are the old games with the OLD graphics from an Atari 2600 (blocky... 8 or 16 bit... retro).The Atari Vault game package also includes some nostolgia box art, original game manuals from the cartridge games and old arcade cabinet art for each of the games offered. Nice touch for those retro game enthusiasts like myself (especially if you have a Rasberry Pi or Steam Box arcade project going and you're looking for the perfect art for the cabinet or whatever). The graphics for the games themsleves are EXACTLY the way they were in the old games or at least so close I couldn't tell the difference. I felt like I was standing at a cabinet instead of my PC.I highly recommend Atari Vault for any gamer who appreciates classic Atari.  Many nicely done classic arcade games in one package from an era when Atari first hit the market and having a pocket of quarters was the way to play video games.Rating 9 of 10. The package would have gotten a full 10 except there were two games not included... ""Battlezone"" and ""Star Wars"".  Two cabinet style games that were from the old vector graphic days of Atari and I would have liked to have seen those games included. There was also no E.T. game in the 2600 Emulator. Petty I know... but I find the probability of them doing a DLC package to include the games they missed... very low and they probably should have just included them if they hadn't planned on future DLC. . If they do indeed do a DLC addon package for this... I will revise to a full 10 on my review.As usual... buy on sale.			"
