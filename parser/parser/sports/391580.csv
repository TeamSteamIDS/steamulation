												Casual it's tagged and casual it is.  Great fun though for an hour or so.  Unfortunately the LUCK factor is very prominent. There's only so much you can do with 'good tactics' .Still I have enjoyed this simple board game very much. The mechanics are working as they should and the graphics are suitably subdued.  Perfect game to spend your inbetween hours on.			"

												Senet is a board game for two players against AI or hotseat, like an easier version of backgammon. It was created by Egyptians in a tech park (""smart village"") outside of Cairo, Egypt.The second video on the store page shows some of the gameplay. The game is quite similar to backgammon, except you're playing in the same direction, and a blockade (sort of) is formed by two or more pawns in sequence - there's never more than one pawn on any space of the board. The game provides little backstory. It is a single player against AI (3 levels of difficulty) or hot-seat two-player gameplay. The game runs fine even on older computers.The pieces move across the board in a Z-shapes path, i.e. right on the top row, left on the center row, then right on the bottom row; your aim is to move all of your pieces off the board before your opponent does. Since there can never be more than one piece on any square, you can generally only move to unoccupied squares; you can also swap position with an opponent's pawn if it has no other pawn adjacent to protect it. Your ""dice"" are 4 sticks colored red and white; the number of whites is your roll, but if you have all red, that counts as 5. You get to roll again on any 1,4 or 5, as often as they keep occurring; play switches to your opponent as soon as you roll a 2 or 3 and make your move. To reduce swapping in the endgame, every pawn needs to reach the 5th to last square (with the paddles), from there, a 5 moves it off the board, 4,3 and 2 move it to end squares where it needs to stay until moved off the board with a throw of 1, 2 or 3 respectively; and a 1 (which must be taken if no other pawn is movable) moves it to the water square, which moves it up a row to the rebirth ankh, or if that's occupied, to the first unoccupied square before it; the same thing happens to pawns that get swapped out on the end squares. Strategy is generally to keep your stones grouped (any group of two or more is safe from swapping), preventing the opponent from forming groups and setting your own stones back, while trying to swap his own stones back.I'd say that games are faster than backgammon because pawns that get ""hit"" don't move back as much; and the strategy is slightly easier, for the same reason. The rules are easy to pick up because the game marks all of your pieces that have legal moves.If you plan to play against a friend, I'd recommend the tablet version (iOS or Android) since that's more comfortable than hotseat on a PC (the board is probably too small for a smartphone screen though); but there's nothing wrong with the Steam version. You're getting a simple board game, no bells and whistles; while you could easily make your own board or use a free flash version (or Tabletop Simulator for online multiplayer), this'll provide an AI to play against on your own and helps you learn the rules.

												According to the description, Seneth is an Ancient Egypt table game. Most probably, its an oldest game that requires players to use counters on the desk.The idea of the game is quite similar to backgammon, as you start from the one side of the desk and the point is to move your counters to another one, while bothering your opponent to do so. However, four sticks are used instead of the rolling dice.It was my first experience with the game, so I would like all novices to understand how easy it is. However, you'd have to practice and think in advance in order to become really worthy player. The rules are described in the main menu; everything is quite simple and understandable, so once you'll enter the game, you'll find out how to play fast enough. Let's move to the most important aspects of the game:
Music. Music in the game matches its overall appearance great and even adds some notes to its atmosphere of an Ancient Egypt. Music is calm and cute, it doesn't go boring and never bothers you while playing.Graphics. The game looks quite beautiful and nice, furthermore, enhances an atmosphere of an Ancient Egypt.The eyes don't go tired even after playing few hours in a row, so you can hold even quite long sessions with no pauses.Gameplay. As I mentioned above, the game is quite easy-to-master. There is nothing complicated in controls, though it's a table game. There are few difficulty levels that make the game much more interesting.In conclusion, for those who're still not sure: if you're a fan either of Ancient Egypt theme or of table games, you'd better buy without even thinking. Refill your collection with one more exciting and interesting game and enhance your playing skills.			"

												Egyptian Senet is a casual game based on the most ancient board game in history. Overall, this game offers a very relaxing and fun experience, and it's perfect if you wish to just chill out in your spare time.Before starting to play Egyptian Senet, you should really read the rules and learn how to game mechanics work. They are still fairly easy to understand, so you don't have to worry too much. Also keep in mind that there are different difficulty settings, to suit your taste.Once in game, the gameplay is simple to understand, but at the same time very fun and engaging. There's a local multiplayer mode available if you wish to share this experience with a friend. On top of all of this, the design is great and accurate. The illustrations are cool and they contribute to the atmosphere of the game. Overall, I strongly recommend this game. Whether you enjoy board games or not, you will still find Egyptian Senet fun and fresh.			"

												The board game itself is not bad, and its long history does add to the charm. I like backgammon type board games, and this is similar, with some strategy but also heavily reliant on the luck of the dice. The idea of keeping it alive by bringing it to modern gamers is something I can appreciate.Unfortunately the digital implementation is very rough, aka: it works and that's about it. Even for a mobile game it doesn't feel polished and the small asking price is no excuse here. Calling the graphics basic is an understatement, the music loop is very short, there is no tutorial, the few pages of written rules make no sense if you haven't already tried playing the game (and oh god that font), plus the AI isn't challening even in the highest difficulty. It just isn't really enjoyable to spend time with. Which is a pity, because I do think that a physical board (or a better app) would make this a fun game to play with a friend in short bursts.As it stands, sorry, good idea, bad computer game.			"

												Based on an early board game played by Ancient Egyptians as early as 3100 BC.The rules are simple, based on the notes of historian Timothy Kendall.The gameplay itself is part strategy and part luck.Strategic moves include moving in groups, blocking your opponent, and even knocking them into the House of Water.Luck is based on dice roles, or in this case, stick throws.Instructions on how to play the game are available from the main menu.It supports local multiplayer, but sadly no online play.Although it could technically be played with a screen sharing app, with one player moving the others players pawns based on verbal instructions.Overall, I enjoyed the game.

												I have always loved playing board games different then the usual. At the price this one is very unique and worth while to any game collector who likes to play something different every night. It didn't take me too long to figure out the rules. I spent a couple of hours playing before I knew it. The only real lacking component of this game would be to polish it up a little more. The rules were plain text, though it was still easy enough to follow along. Overall good value for a different kind of game.			"

												It has that mistic of being an ancient game while it is actually fund to play and exciting. Always read the rules first. THIS GAME IS LOCAL MULTIPLAYER, not Online Multiplayer.

												Egyptian Senet is a casual puzzle game that can be played either solo or with a friend on the same device.At first I was a little confused but after 5 minutes of playing, as well as rereading the tutorial I came to fully understand the rules.Pros:Easy to learn but unique gameplay ( reminded me of sorry!)Hot seat multiplayerInteresting musicMultiple difficulty optionsLow price!Cons:No save game featureNo internet multiplayerIn summary, the game is great for killing time (took me about 20-30 minutes a game), but I do think it would be a lot more fun with internet multiplayer. It would also be nice to be able to save single player games so we could finish them later, but other then that I think this game is pretty solid. "

												It's a small and modest indie board game, it doesn't try to be big or epic, it's just a casual board game.I've played this game with a friend and it was pretty fun. It is a casual board game that resembles backgamoon, but I guess it is a little bit easier (cause I cannot understand how to play bg but I've learned to play this one pretty fast).You can read the rules before starting a match, but it is pretty easy to understand the game by just playing it, even more easy if you are playing against another human.If you want something to casually play, with a friend or not, and like board games, I totally recommend this one.

												NOTE: I received a key explicitly for reviewing Egyptian Senet. How I perceived this game whether it’s positively or negatively is entirely up to me.Egyptian Senet is a casual board game in which you have to move all of your pawns to the far end of the board. It's somewhat similar to backgammon and checkers, It is also the earliest known board game in history.PROS : Price -  For what it's worth the game is pretty cheap (Less than $5)Gameplay - At the start I was pretty confused on the rules and set in the game but after 5 minutes i was having fun, It's more fun and exciting if you are playing with someone since the game is designed for 2 playersNo Bugs - It's no suprise that no game-breaking bug is found since it's a board game with no delicate mechanicsCONS :Graphics - The game could be better if the graphics would be improved.Multiplayer - Hotseat Multiplayer is nice but i think the game's replayability can be lengthen by having a online multiplayerOverall : 7.5/10 - Egyptian Senet is great game for it's price i would recommend getting this on sale for the optimal ""Bang for your Buck"" "

												What started as a good idea to combine Egypt and a boardgame ended as a deception for me. This game is like Sorry! the boardgame with the annoying rule to land on the goal precisely. The music doesn't sound anything like Egypt. The pictures are good but there is no animation, just sliding pieces and premade roll of sticks (as dices). The rules are printed in a long text to scroll down instead of a neat tutorial. Overall, who wins the game is purely random and I don't like.			"

												Initial play review here. I've only played one round against AI so far. However, here is my constructive critique of the game.First off, allow me to say that obscure, archaic board games are something that fascinate me. I just saw this on sale, and could afford it, so I grabbed it. I'm not particularly picky about graphics, music, or visual interface. As long as it more or less does its job, I'm happy. Yes, the interface and graphics are simple, and the music isn't amazing, but that's not a concern for me. The gameplay mechanics, from what I can tell, function as they should. Senet is a game of luck. There is a little bit of strategy with whatever moves you end up being permitted to use. It's more like thinking ahead, or even prioritizing. Mostly, however, it's luck.Try not to be intimidated by the game at first, given the lack of a tutorial. There are instructions, and yes, those instructions are a little bit difficult to comprehend in the manner it is written. I encourage you to give it an initial play-through against AI. Just dive in, and do it. My first playthrough started with me knowing little to nothing about what to do. But within minutes, I was picking up the pace between moves and turns, and soon found myself almost instinctively getting a feel for the game. My first playthrough was a victory.Pros:- Very light weight file size- Very low system requirements (aside from requiring at least Win7)- Simple and straight forward interface- Easy to learn gameplay- Game is based almost entirely on luck; some but very little strategy involved- Personal opinion: Being based upon a real life ancient Egyptian board game is entertaining- Single player (vs AI) and Two Player modes- Different difficulty levels vs AI- Different interface text language options.Cons:- Lack of screen-resolution options- Lack of window-mode options- Lack of in-game volume slider (sound toggle and music toggle only)- Lack of guided tutorial.- Readable instructions are present, but difficult to comprehend at first.Overall, if you enjoy obscure, archaic/ancient board games, and don't care too much for trivial matters such as graphics, this is the game for you. It indeed does play with a very casual atmosphere, but I feel that perhaps that's what is intended with board games, especially from ancient times. I feel that they were likely used as simply ""something to pass the time when feeling dull and bored"". It's definitely a great boredom killer, and even more fun for history and mythology buffs.
