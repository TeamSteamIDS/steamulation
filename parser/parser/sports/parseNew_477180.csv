								In my honest opinion the lack of content is just overwhelmed by the simplistic joy of playing this game. Hell, even in this state playing Shard Games gives you that magic moments of self-appreciation when you make a skill move and and kill your enemy to FREAKIN MOON. Crossing my fingers for devs in hope that they keep their (i believe) hard work and deliver us a non-stopping ""bomb-this♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥man"" action. I give this game 7.8/10 with the only (temporary, i hope) downfall being lack of easily everything (players, content etc. in the initial release... But then again, it comes clear enough when you see EARLY ACCESS tag. Well, that is certainly not the worst of the worst of the Greenlight, so - we'll see what comes next.P.S. I do really like that ""sunny garden"" map. Maybe it's just marble.			"

								This game has potential if it ever gets of the ground. That being said at the moment this is blowing yourself up simulator and you dont even get to see your body ragdoll. Has potential but isn't met.			"
