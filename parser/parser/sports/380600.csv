Early Access Review
								Fishing Planet when it came out was good. Early access, full of glitches and bugs but delivered a fun fishing experience. Then a few months in they started to do choices that were taking a lot of the fun away. Then they recruited moderators left and right ""with years of experience""... from where? Guantanamo? If you made an issue public they tended to try talk it away with different excuses, and darn you if you didn't settle with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t they served you. Forum ban. Haven't experienced it myself, but seen quite a few people being banned. Even Castaway_Dave, 1200+ hours in the game and probably one of the nicest guys in the game, have been banned for making a point of a huge glitch concerning weather patterns in Michigan and going into inventory and VOILA weather has changed.....!  They decided that better he goes then fixing the code.Enough said. Read the pros and cons  and decide forr yourself.Pros:- It's a fishing game- graphics... sadly list ends thereCons:- Never ending list of bugs and glitches- Staff, support staff and forum moderators are probably the most unsympathetic and unprofessional people you will ever experience in a ""mmo"" game out there. (Can be useful to experience as a reference for future games)- Forum moderators engage in discussions and tend to ban if they don't agree with you, or if you make the public aware of issues that they don't whant anyone to know about. (just a couple of examples)- Oh and if they read this post they will surely do their outmost to get it removed or otherwise respond to it in kind to these ""unfair"" charges.			"

								Got banned from the game for playing this game a lot... Yeah really.. I found a bug and told people about it and I got banned because it means less money in the pocket of killerwallet. Eitherway check it out its a good fun game and I would have kept playing it. I made a video of the bug that got me banned and I'd link it to show everyone but the dev filed a tastey copyright infringment notice on it so it's gone. The idea here is that if people don't know about the bug then you don't have to worry about fixing it. I'm guessing the devs hate me because I exposed the fishing mechanics that this game uses to spawn fish. Basicaly there are no fish in the water and one just spawns based on a dice roll from a few factors when your bobber lands. Moral of the story here is don't play buggy and broken games by money grubbing early access devopers who only care about making money and not about making a game that works.Edit: I reached out to support about my ban and video take down.Support (sent by *****@fishingplanet.com) Using game bugs as cheats and disclosure it on a public channel without sent to the developers is and act of cheating and disrespect to developer, In your home country it also a crime.You violate the EULA in a section of using bugs and cheats and not notify developers about it.Even more, after we move your thread to bug section you start a new thread with the same links, also send them to players in chats.This behavior is unacceptable. We suggest to remove the second video from your channel, or we will need to ask youtube to take down all FP videos from your channel because of EULA violations.Me:Not sure if you are trolling me again but:""Using game bugs as cheats and disclosure it on a public channel without sent to the developers is and act of cheating and disrespect to developer, In your home country it also a crime.""First the bug was never used as a cheat but merely a way to go under the river. Second the developers are disrespectful to their community. Also I did report this bug on the forums so, no.  And again WTF are you going to try and arrest and sue me under? The CFAA? GL.""You violate the EULA in a section of using bugs and cheats and not notify developers about it.Even more, after we move your thread to bug section you start a new thread with the same links, also send them to players in chats.""What is this contradicting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t?

Don't worry I deleted all that trash from my channel. I would hate to have anyone even think I supported a developer like you.Also run your emails through a proof reader. Those mistakes are unprofessional.Have a wonderful day.			"

								This game is aiming to be a fishing simulator, realistic fish habits, movement, etc. It's not too realistic that it takes away the fun of it being a game. It's very different from other fishing games I've played. I'd love to see what updates they add to make the game even better. It has a lot of kinks but I expected as much.Pros:- F2P- Not pay to win, you can only buy exp boost or extra credits (earned by just playing the game)- Lots of unique features from other fishing games- Not just a ""catch & reel"" game- Easy to learn after a while- Different fishing methods- Pretty graphics/animations- Other players are pretty helpful, especially when trying to learn a new area- All DLC content are just items obtainable in-gameCons:- Tutorial is bad, by bad I mean, confusing + teaches you almost nothing- Really heavily targeted at fishers right now- F1 (help/keybinds) is messy, they should probably color code it- By multiplayer it means it has a chatbox in-game (Hopefully they're adding other players or something like that)Overall still a great game, and one of the best fishing games I've played. If you have time, want to try something new, or enjoy fishing, give the game a shot.			"

								Freemium. P2W. Broken line mechanics. Shady DLC treatment. Community sacrificed for 3D models (for some reason). Bite rates decreased. Prices inflated. Mobile-game cooldown mechanics. $100 for one year of ""Premium"". $50 for unlimited license to one area (Alaska). Lack of direction, lack of communication, poor economy management that leads to consumer punishment. Do not make in-game purchases, as it is a waste until fixed.EDIT 01/22/2017: Communication was provided freely during closed beta to ""eQ"" a.k.a. Hegert, who relayed to me they are ""Public Relations"" for Fishing Planet while in my stream.  All issues still stand other than a minor improvement in line physics (most techniques still broken).  Would recommend said ""PR"" not being snarky to players simply because they disagree with current system - as we're quite capable of 'calculating'. Especially zero, which is remarkably the same amount of money I will be putting in from this moment forward.			"

								Could be a great game. I can NOT recommend in its current state.As it stands they keep nerfing the fish. Keep messing with the feel of the fight...At the moment it is nothing more than a ""Shoot fish in a barrel"" type game.There is no variation in fishing tactics, each fish can be caught by using 'X' bait at 'Y' spot.Also the forums are scrubbed of ANY type of criticism. Players get permanent forum bans for saying anything about the game in a negative way.My son's perma ban resulted from saying ""Ok you can go catch the same fish 1-2000 times in the same place with the same bait. Enjoy your awesome fishing Sim.""No warning or anything, so be careful what you say if you do try to speak in forums.			"

Early Access Review
								I put just about a 100 hours into this game, life got complicated for me so I stepped away from it for a few months. Come back to find ridiculous pay to play schemes. When I was playing intensely I set myself the goal of buying unlimited licenses for all the areas using ingame cash from catching fish which was very grindy but totally possible to do, now its baitcoins or whatever they call it to get unlimited. It had a well balanced economy, now I look at prices and my mouth falls open. The durabilty and pay to repair items is ridiculous, in the real world I have fishing rods from my great grandfather that still work beautifully with out having to ""repair"" them after fishing for a day, so I see no practical gaming reason for this mechanic. Sure I snapped a rod once in the 25 years ive been fishing, ten minutes later with some bamboo splints and string I was back to fishing. Yes I should get a new tackle bag, the one that was given to me as a kid is pretty worn out, But I think it will last me another year or two.This was a great game once upon a time, a bit grindy a bit buggy but overall I was astounded at the promise it showed and laughed at other lesser fishing simulators. I bought some real money dlcs to support what I thought would be the greatest fishing game of the decade. Now? Nope, im too old to fall into this money trap. Perhaps one day it wont be like it is now and I sincerly hope so. Until then, farewell.			"

Early Access Review
								This saddens me. As a real life fishing enthusiast, I was absolutely thrilled when I found this game on Steam about a year ago. It was fun, the leveling up to 20 or so wasn't too grindy (well it was, but not overbearingly), and all in all it was a relaxing game to play after a long day at work, or right after waking up and sitting down with your morning coffee. I even felt bad about such a decent game being ""free,"" so I purchased a few of the DLCs.I fell out of the game, for no other reason except for playing other games. I reinstalled the other day, and firstly found out most things have changed. For one, when I logged in, it told me I needed to repair my broken items. For the low, low price of $20,000. Yes. Twenty thousand dollars. I was in the process of saving money last time I'd played, and I didn't even have half that saved.Ok, I said, and moved on. Then I tried to go to a mid-level lake (Florida isn't technically a lake, I know) and saw it would cost nearly all my money to go there once. Screw it, I said, and went there. Peak fishing wasn't until late afternoon, so I skipped time. Well I misclicked, and instead of 4pm, I clicked 3pm. No biggie. I hit T to forward time again. There is a damned cooldown on waiting. But don't worry, if you buy Baitcoins, you can bypass the wait time! I then spent about an hour trying various baits that the game told me particular fish in that area loved without so much as a bite. When I did catch one, if I remember correctly, it was worth about $200. So, $8000 to go there for the day, and $200 per fish caught? Seems fair...That summed up where this game has gone, and it saddens me to say that I'll be uninstalling it and hoping a less money-hungry company makes a game where this one decided to abandon gameplay for cash grabs.PS: Don't worry, you can buy Baitcoins with your trusty Steam wallet and convert them to in-game cash, so as long as you're willing to spend $50 or so, (1 coin = $100, and $50 gets you 1090 coins, $10,000 to visit Alaska for one day) you can go to any lake in the game!

								EDIT: Pointing out the developer response to this review, located in the review comments below, was literally ""LOL"" then mocked my review because I hadn't played in a few weeks (you know, maybe because they ruined the game by the time I got back and there's no reason to log on anymore?). Here's another thumbs down to the kid they hired in their PR department giving childish responses to their customers reviews.TL;DR = Game was awesome, F2P, people paid because it was worth it. Now after the update, it's a freemium game complete with timers and cooldowns THAT THEY ADDED specifically to get you to pay to skip it. (That right there says enough, but by all means read the reviews and their own update log to see all the other fun crap that made half the playerbase leave since then, and you can go verify player pops to see yourself. I encourage it.)Was a good game until the new update. Update changed many core mechanics, got rid of DLC items people already paid for (they lost the items as they no longer exist in the game) and basically some of these changes, like the home lake change, got rid of things players spent WEEKS farming for. That's FARMING TIME, not while you are at work or school time.Game is much more ""give us money"" in every way now, and they ADDED annoying crap like timers and cooldowns (facebook games, anyone?) that you can, of course, pay for to skip or speed up.Basically this was a great game who people put money into because they liked and enjoyed it, and now it's some freemium crap with all sorts of gameplay additions to make it more difficult for you while not adding much to the game, but of course, you can just get out that wallet now.....Thankfully I type fast, and this only took 2-3 minutes of my time, but that is all the time I am willing to still put into this game, and just crapping on it more in this review seems redundant.

								The game is ok, but the people running it don't allow you to give help to others to find the best fish. They will ban you because of it and give any excuse other than the truth. They keep upsetting a lot of people with their attitude in the forums, short answers and lies too. Before the last update they promised more XP for Common fish and Trophy fish, but they lied and put the XP down on ALL fish types and upset the community. Now they're banning people and without warning, even though posting in the forums that people will get a warning first! I wouldn't trust them so far as to throw them. If i were you steer well clear of this. It isn't that good anyhow, well not anymore!Now this developer has the audacity to accuse me of abuse thrown at their developement team on my REVIEW!!! See people this is the sort of thing you have to put up with, a bunch of LIARS, nothing more, just plain liars. I did NOT give them abuse, I have witnesses to the fact, that was BEFORE they took DOWN MY POST IN THEIR FORUMS, to hide the truth no doubt!OH and another thing ALEX, you NEVER WARNED ME AT ALL (again you lied) you just BANNED ME WITHOUT WARNING YOU LIAR!!!!!!They DON'T like NEGATIVE feedback and try their damndest to get rid of it, they ban you if they don't like what you say, they accuse you of things that you didn't do and don't allow you to protest. Take this on board before you get into playing their simulator. HERE's PROOF;This is part of the evidence within their forum (the rest has been deleted by them);alex  [developer] 3 Sep @ 6:01pm Originally posted by spotme_2:You didn't warn me before you banned me! Why? And in particular the reason you gave wasn't sufficient. You should have a word blocker in place to prevent anbody being offended in the first place. I used a few bad words, but none were aimed at anybody within the lobby, yet you banned me hours later...All i've been doing is trying to do is help others so that they can enjoy your simulator, so basically doing you guys a favour in reality, and this is what I get? Really poor guys, really poor. And now you post this, saying you will always make warnings before banning...?Yes, we banned users without warning lately but from now we shall give a chance to correct the post prior to ban.Last edited by alex; 3 Sep @ 6:Now hide that truth ALEX the LIAR DEVELOPER!!!! YOU BANNED ME WITHOUT WARNING. That was out of order and you damn well know it, you lied on more than one occasion, and because I pointed this out you banned me from your damn forum, so don't tell more lies and accuse me on my review, that I gave abuse towards your team, because the evidence is there for ALL to see how you people are!FREEDOM OF SPEECH you liar!YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!Footnote:-Well said Nordek. If they had simply warned me instead of a ban without warning, I would simply had stopped doing what they wanted me not to do, and I would have just carried on playing it. But they went too far (especially Alex) and gave me another ban without warning from their forums because I asked why the ban, and pointed out that they lied about the raising of the XP on Common & Trophy fish, basically I was seeking the real truth behind why they banned me.Furthermore he then slanted me on my very own review of their simulator with more lies, accusing me of abusing their staff, and basically saying that's the reason they banned me and also lied about warning me to be simply polite! I've been nothing but polite in every way possible, however he took something personal and turned into something rather pathetic to say the least and certainly over the top in banning me for what can only be seen as helping others with trying to catch Unique fish. Which by the way others do frequently day by day on their simulator. Which makes me wonder if they banned me for doing just that, are they then saying they are going to ban all that do that very thing, just because they don't like it...? Seems rather silly to ban people over something harmless as helping others enjoy their simulator, which in my opinion would simply help them to grow...But hey, what do I know?			"

Bans should be temporary in order to serve as a reminder of the discussion rules. Permanent bans should not be issued in most cases.""and ""Don't argue with your fans.""The mod as been know to perma ban to censore negaitive feedback on the claims it is abusive which is fine but perment ban are not best practice. This is a sign the mod does not care to give people second chances and let the commuity grow but to show off his power (in my opinion) and argue with commuity when people disagree with him as shown in the video when he refers to the commuity as Children.Honestly, it's fine for a mod to be a little ban heavy but when he repeatly agrues with people then bans people that don't agree with him it a little too much.

Early Access Review
								DO NOT BUY DLC----------I really enjoyed this game before the update. The mechanics were great although it took ages to level up without dlc and premium. My biggest gripe is that I recently bought the Anniversary DLC that came with some great gear like the Fishfort Keepnet 660lb and lots of 6/0 spinners and lures. After the patch they nerfed this DLC (even though i had already paid for it and was using the items prior to the patch) so that the keepnet was replaced with a 440lb limit and the lures and spinners went from 6/0 hooks to 4/0 (this is just some of the nerfed items). They essentially took my money that i gladly paid for the dlc because of its great value and specific content, and stripped me of several benefits that it originally came with. This is unacceptable, a shady business practice to say the least, down right theft to say the worst. And this, folks, is how they treat paying customers. This is very unwise considering its a free to play game that relies on community support through dlc and premium purchases. Its fine to play for free, just dont trust them with your money. Right now this game holds a monopoly on the market for fishing games, but all that might change if a large developer brings out a paid game that does just as great a job without the freemium content this game relies on. In any case, my wallet is now closed to these developers. Heck of a way to celebrate their anniversary. This review will remain negative until they return the items they took from this DLC in their original glory.			"

								..... This is disgusting. I really enjoyed this game when it was first introduced. I'm sad to see it going in the direction that it is headed, as this was one of my favorite games. I like some of the new innovations and fish, but the game mechanics are becoming much too annoying. It seems as if you guys are now doing this for money and it also shows that you guys have no clue what you're doing. You are ruining this game. We were promised boats and other tackle a year ago. All I see with every update is new DLC and garbage game mechanics. This is despicable. Return the mechanics to their oldest form, and I promise you, there will be many more players that will enjoy this game daily, and possibly want to spend money on it, which is obviously what you guys want...

								I thought the game was fine before the update. Travel and gear costs were reasonable, if you didn't have the dlc it was still a joy to play because the bite/hook up ratio was fair enough to keep you busy. Premium was/is expensive, but if you played without it, it didn't really subtract any fun from the game (you'll just lvl a little slower). What this game had before the update was large sociable chat rooms, loyal players who would pay for dlc/premium to support game, it was enjoyable, and an outstanding community. Now there are pay to play blocks everywhere, the economic system in game has changed and made everything more expensive (I thought it was fine the way it was), only 5 people in a room together at a time now, hook up ratio is just low enough to make the game unenjoyable and mundain. I used to genuinely love to play this game but it is now at the bottom of the 'totem pole' for me. Sad to see a game with such potential ruined.			"

If you are a fisherman in real life, or if you have never fished in your life you would get enjoyment out of this game. This game is like crack and I can't get enough! There is so much potential with this early access game and from the way the devs are constantly updating facebook, they really care about the community. Community is another point I want to hit on. Everyone that ive ran into so far is willing to help the inexperienced and I love that! There are so many games now a days with bad communites that it can just ruin anyones time in a game.

								6 Months ago this would have been a completely different review. The developers of this game originally stated that this game would always be a F2P with a premium option to speed leveling, etc. Gold (Baitcoins) would never be available to purchase and were a reward for catching Unique fish. Well, I took a couple months off of playing this game for life reasons, and I come back to find this game is now completely P2W. Gold is now a purchase item. Home lakes are apparently gone, so instead of being able to set your home state and return to your favorite lake cheaply, you have to pay exhorbitant prices to travel each time that you want to go. A license that I ground for hours to obtain, now costs about $20 real money to obtain. This developer has essentially lied to their community through and through. I would not recommend this game anymore. It's not even fun with all the nerfing they have put into the game. Really wish I had never spent money to support these lying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s by buying premium and DLC. If you don't mind burning massive ammounts of time on a P2W that you'll never get anywhere with, go for it. Otherwise stay away.			"

								I really hate to post this review, as I greatly enjoyed the short time I had with this game. I came back afer not playing for about a month only to find prices in game jacked up to the point it simply isn't worth playing.I have seen many reviews commented on by the developers about how money needs to be put on the table, and that you can't expect it to be truly free to play without some sacrifice. I myself put food on my table by writing software, and take it from me, people that write software in this manner do not mean well. They think that you are a sucker, and if you continue to give money as they reduce functionality, then you are what they think you are and you deserve what you get.The only way to change the outcome is to uninstall. Without a decent player count, the money supply is cut off. They have two choices at that point: cut bait and move on to another cash grab, or restore gameplay to a decent state.I will gladly change this to a positive review if the devs come to their senses, but I doubt it will happen. Devs rarely change tact if they have a cash grab on their hands. Hard to change your spots once they have been seen.Oh well, it was fun while it lasted. You guys actually do have decent chops at making a solid fishing game. Shame you squandered it.			"

								Edit on January 19th (original review done in response to the first update of the 0.7.0 beta):The devs are beginning to tweak some things and do bug fixes. This is a good sign. While I still have issues I listed below, I'm happy to see devs working on things like line physics, astronomical prices, gear balancing, and other bugs. Check out DIscussions for info.Edit Feb 20, 2017: Short summary of game status: The ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game economy is starting to feel like Cold War era dropping sad lonely rubles into a rusted coffee can to take down to buy my loaf of stale bread and 12 pieces of toilet paper every week in my holey fishing outfit I can't afford to repair. 0.7.0 Beta pre-release review (early Jan 2017): Cons: I really enjoyed the game but the game is now being updated and features special currency (""baitcoin""...) that effectively locks the good gear behind real money. The normal game currency is becoming severely devalued to the point where 10x increased cost is the new normal. This equates to a grind to catch all the fish you need to pay down the 10x travel costs, the 10x daily access fee, the 10x daily fishing license, then make 10x a profit after that to afford all the average gear upgrades so you can then pay the next 10x travel cost, 10x daily access fee and 10x license to go to a better location suitable to your level, so that you don't sink yourself into a cash and experience hole by staying in a low-level area. Yaaay.Avatars have been added to the game, but no way to disable them so you can't quietly fish without several others standing on top of you, nor are you able to do anything about someone using their avatar to block you. You have to move and hope they don't follow you, or leave the map and lose the enormous fees you paid to fish there. Because of the avatars, the room size has been shrunk down from 20 to 5, so the fun, social aspect of the game is currently, for me at least, not there anymore. The game mechanics for the rod, reel and tackle have changed in such a way that lures hit the water surface like a brick, lines are so fine they're difficult to control, setting the hook on a bite will jerk the fish out of the water and send it flying way overhead. There's also something called a pond pass which also costs real money. You can, of course, also buy baitcoin with real currency to have access to the associated perks in the game.Current players who have shelled out over the past year+ with time, money, purchase of DLC to support development of this early access game, are in the dark about what the plan is to convert their current bank, gear, purchased content, and time invested. There's been comments but no official announcement, and the release of the beta is supposedly now only a couple of days away. I'd have loved to shell out a monthly subscription fee for this game without all the b.o.l.l.o.c.k.s. they're adding in. Even the premiere level which you buy with real money costs additional real money for baitcoin.Pros: Looks like some of the graphics got a touch-up.			"

								I reviewed this title a while back, and while I didn't recommend it then I was too leniant on its cons as I really wanted the title to succeed, and I believed in the developers.It is also a good looking title, and feels good in many ways.I dont believe anymore, the developers are frustratingly similiar to politicians, they react to positive posts that are 'harmless' but completely ignore any serious questions, like ...- Why is the drag setting so limited ? 7 Settings only (0 - 6) ?- Why does heavier tackle struggle to cope with small fish ? A 0.7 kg smallmouth redlining a 9.1k line on a 10.5 kg reel on a heavy rod ? At half drag setting ?- What EXACTLY does the message 'Fish tried to bite and escaped'  ? Specualtion is , hook size is wrong but that doesnt make sense as the same hook can catch a 5.1 kg striper and a 0.9 kg smallmouth , so what fish is struggling to take that hook ?These questions could be easily answered and the whole debacle put away for good, but no answer.There is also the unrealistic mechanics in place, like...- Catching 'uniques' , you dont just fish away and have a 'whopper' take your bait... nope you check online videos or lists, or your own excel spreadsheets for 'proper timing and rigs' and fast forward time to the 'correct window' and for an in game hour or two you try catch 'uniques'. You cant be patiant as the time is ticking away, the window is small and the in game time is accellerated.- The game gives you charts that show when the fish activity is at its highest, but that doesnt include 'uniques' , outside that particular window they are close for business utterly.- The game has 2 types of in game stores to buy tackle and baits, the megastore that has everything but you cant use it when at a fishing location, you have to leave the location and then access the megastore, and the pay travel to return to your fishing location. There are store local to the fishing location but they make no sense, more often than not they will not stock the bait you need for that location (Wax Worms for Sunfish in Cali - not in the Cali shop).- Hope you dont like catfish or panfish, they aint worth a damn according to this game, nope you need to catch bass, pike and Salmon for any decent exp and rewards.- Physics are mess, the fish will be staring at the sky with thier tails facing the bottom yet pulling on your line while being dragged sideways while the fish is in a vertical posture. You will often need to drag fish through the ground, your rod will attempt to use ninja clone techniques while fishing (double rods) and your fisherman will often reveal that they are blue aliens when the skin colour 'washes' off.Defenders of the title will pull out the old Early Access defence, yet  the title has 4 current DLC packs and has had 2 event DLC packs, 6 DLC packs since August, yet the title has numerous mechanical faults which have been brought up pre-early access during its close beta period, and not addressed.Looks good, feels good but is not a very good simulator. the more time you invest the harder it gets to ignore the cracks but the developers seem to be staring at stars if you look at their 'roadmap' ... cars, boats, houses, worldwide locations, customisable avatars... they havent even got the basics down yet, nor even added features that should of been in place long ago like quests and tournaments.It is the better fishing sim, but in a rather limited race and with very poor competitors its hardly much of a endorsement. Try it out but dont expect much in terms of simulation... its a casual feels good looks good arcade game, with some bare minimal simulation.			"

								I'll start this off with saying I do like the game despite its problems and slow update pattern. But as it stands with the long list of bugs/glitches and slow updates I cannot recommend the game as-is until a more realistic update schedule is put in place. However despite the game, that is not the problem nor is it the main concern I have about the future of the game... Its the forum moderator that is ultimately killing the community from the inside by deleting and even banning people for posting anything even remotely negative or critical. I'll tell you about my experience, and you can make up your own assumptions. This has been going on for a long time now and people have noticed how bad the power-trip of FlaGuitars has gotten over the last 6 months. There is even YouTube videos coming from reputable tubers about the community-horror censor-machine that is FlaGuitars.I have always been very out spoken in the forums and have called out FlaGuitars directly when he has spoken down to people, called them children (in a round-about sort of way), and even broken rules set out in the steam forums ToS by dishing out, what I found to be, offensive, derogitory and insulting replies to people who have called him on the deluded way he handles forums posts that do not adhere to his selfish, bullying attitude.The most recent case of this, some one, (rightly so) asked why his forum posts keep getting deleted after a few hours. Being a victim of this unprofessional practice FlaGuitars preaches in the post, I posted a reply detailing my experience with exactly the same issue as the OP. I named FlaGuitars (as he is the only moderator on the forums), and gave an accurate, detailed desciption of what happened to my previous posts n the subject. Less than an hour later I was banned from the forums permanently for 'Foul language and insulting a moderator.' Which is kind of ironic, as all I actually did was speak about FlaGuitars censorship in the forums. To think that FlaGuitars find his own acts 'insulting' is a joke in itself, considering the amount of people I have spoke to he has directly insulted and offended by talking to them as if they were children, (which is also against the steam ToS).So in a nutshell, if you are happy with being treated like a 2-year old with no intellect and can happily follow a dictatorship-based community, and play a game with a never ending list of bugs, then by all means download and have a go. I'm afraid that if FlaGuitars carrys on his ban-wave of destruction, then this community is going to be dead before the game even comes out of EA.Note : I am also of the firm belief that the devs are unaware of the enourmity of the problems this one guy is causing to their game they have worked hard on, and I dont think they are getting fair bug reports due to FlaGuitars removing them in such a manner.If a dev ever reads this, you really need to hire another fourm moderator with better people skills that can take critisim. Mark my words, he will destroy your community.Thanks for reading my review.~XPS : Details of my ban can be found here :http://s26.postimg.org/nn83un4gp/ban.pngEdit 1: I did not receive a warning, which is in the community rules set out by the development team (your superiors, yes there are people above you), I need to have received before a ban of any level is dished out. Way to break the rules once again, I am the proof.""The bans may last one day minimum. From now on we shall always make warnings before banning.""http://steamcommunity.com/app/380600/discussions/0/527274088388296207/Edit 2:Thanks to reviewer Rezeak for finding this :https://partner.steamgames.com/documentation/moderating_best_practices#Banning""Bans should only be issued when someone posts in violation of the Steam Community Rules And Guidelines. Bans should be temporary in order to serve as a reminder of the discussion rules. Permanent bans should not be issued in most cases.""Edit 3:More proof FlaGuitars deletes posts he makes that are personal attacks.http://s26.postimg.org/6v3y9jtqx/rev3.pngOh, the irony...Edit 4:Links with proof/experience of others :http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rezeak/recommended/380600http://steamcommunity.com/id/CactuszGaming/recommended/380600/http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198054395134/recommended/380600https://s26.postimg.org/dfkz4hsux/mod_fourm1.pnghttp://i.imgur.com/9fLx8Nu.png

								The new update is designed to destroy equipment you grined together (or bought) so you spend more cash on new gear.Radically shifted to buy-to-win. Follow the changes but dont fish with anything you like to keep right now. It was ok with most players to make the game more challengeing (as it was easy, 3 fish sizes and ""hit the spot catches"") but that is not what this last update is about as things stand. I bought a couple of the DLCs, and tried permium for a bit to avoid grind but not spending a dime more until we see if these changes are permanent.			"

								This game WAS the best game on here for the several months I played it  before the ""big update"".   Well, folks, the devs have completely RUINED it with all the new criteria that must be met to play it.  Forget the pure pleasure of throwing a line in the water & see what happens.  I had a reel drop from 95% to broken on ONE fish. It must have been a nice one, but I'll never know.   I have been fishing for 55 YEARS, and I have NEVER broken a reel in my entire life.  Only one of MANY changes that have resulted in a BAD experience with this game as it is now.  I've lost several thousand in-game bucks since the new & improved version came out.  Can't afford to travel anymore, lose too much $.  No more big fish; even with modest drag settings, the line (or reel or pole) breaks because you can't retrieve the fish.  Still limited access to the trophy & unique fish because of very poorly placed paths & clear areas.  Wear & tear on the equipment?   Totally unrealisitc.  Of course if they make it wear out quickly, you have to but it more often.... but really?   I'm still using the rod & reel set my GrandDad got me for my 13th birthday.  Come on, for cryin' out loud !!  You made really HORRIBLE decisions concerning the game play here.   Admit it and fix it !!!!!			"

								It was a fun game but after the 0.7.0 patch it's gone down the drain. It seems now to be focused in player's real wallets instead of getting people to have fun and enjoy the game.The interface overhaul went into the wrong direction. Line physics are completly broken.What you paid with gold currency ingame had, most of them, the stats changed for worst.Just avoid it.			"

								Easily the best fishing game out there and not because there aren't many fishing games out there but because the game does a great job at immersion with beautiful visuals and audio and you can just relax. Of course by relaxing, I don't mean that the game is easy, if you want to go for small fish go ahead, that's easy, but if you want some nice largmouth bass you gotta work for it!DetailsThe game is full of small little awesome details. Like I only realized recently that there are actual fishes in the lake! I always thought that the game was random and it assigned a fish to your hook (based on location and bait etc...) when you caught one, but no that's not how it works! You can see them if the water is clear and shallow! They move around your bait, poke it, hit it and if you're convicing enough, they'll bite it!Learning curveFirst thing I'd like to mention is that, you don't need to have any actual fishing experiences in real life to be able to play and enjoy this game!The game can be hard at first, specially after you level up once or twice, all the new equipments that unlock can be overwhelming. There's a tutorial at the beginning of the game but it doesn't cover a lot of the stuff you'll need to catch bigger fish later in the game. So you'll have to look up tutorials and read item descriptions to figure out how to work with the new rod you just bought.Although there are some pop up tutorials here and there after you level up, catch a new fish or buy something new, I'm not sure exactly how they are triggered, but they give you some essentional info about for example how to catch a new type of fish.Fuzzy Logic, No RandomnessAlso there isn't an element of randomness to this game when it comes to catching fish, by that I mean that the game uses a fuzzy logic recognition system. What does that mean? It means that when you're trying to catch a fish by for example a retrieval method like Stop&Go (there are multiple retrieval methods in the game), your consistancy in luring the fish determines the quality of the fish. That's not randomness, that's as close as you can get to real life simulation! I love these devs!The DevelopersSpeaking of the devs, they are great and they know what they're doing. They are active and constantly fixing the game and notifying about the server's status etc...TL;DRIt's an awesome fishing game, with some suprising great little details. Try it, you won't regret it! No need for real life fishing experiences.8.5/10 "

								I don't review games. I don't really think anyone cares what i have to say about them. But i can't hold my tongue on this one anymore.I used to really enjoy this one, in fact it was my go to game, until they ""rebalanced"" the game a couple of months ago. I could log on, kill a few hours, have fun chatting with folks and catching fish. Since the rebalance, it is nothing more than a grind game. And a slow one at that.Heres what I used to  like: The game worked. rod and line physics were reasonable, i could catch enough fish to make a few in game credits and didnt have to micromanage.All of that is broken now. the fishing line is like rubber. the rods are like slinkys. The fish don't bite enough to keep things entertaining. Costs are so high that i can't see how a new player would get anywhere. Heck I'm having trouble making the new economy work at level 38. And the social aspect is ruined as well. They added stupid 3D avatars that basically fill up every fishing spot and ditract from the experience. I can't turn them off, so I fish alone to keep from having <insert name here>'s arms and rod in my line of sight.The devs have claimed that they fixed some of the issues by lowering travel costs at certain places and tweaking the physics. I don't see any improvement.The way i see it, its a game. It should be entertaining, and this just isn't anymore. If i want to catch only six or eight fish a day, I'll wait for spring and walk down to my dock and do it in a couple hours.I would have recommended this game 4 months ago, now I just can't. If you want to fish, go to a real lake.			"

								Well as a last resort I'm reviewing this game. I've been playing this game from within 30 days of launch. It has had it's ups and downs. About a year after release this game was pretty good. Great physics, decent amount of lures maps etc. Then the devs announced they were try to get the game picked up on a console. Suddenly the devs began to cram features and items in at an alarming pace, and began to refuse to fix known bugs and play issues. Suddenly the game physics got worse, and lag spikes abounded. Did anyone fix any of this? No but they did ad avatars, so that people you don't know can jump up and down in front of you while you're fishing... YAY!The current state of the game is unplayable, not to mention the times the economy has been ""tweaked"" where the only result is you have your hard earned money stolen. I don't recommend this game for anyone who wants to have fun fishing. If you like grinding games like cookie clicker then sure play it.			"

								Fishing Planet was a game with tons of Potential when it first released.The game has since initially grown in popularity and success, at first the dev'sdid some unique things, like tournaments where they actually ponied up and payed out real life cash for the winners.They released more content more places to fish, they brought out competitions etc.At first glance it seemed like a game heading in all the right directions.And then you started to see the true end goal.  To make money!  However, why should a gamemaking money be that big of a deal its sorta the purpose of a game is to make its developer's money!Well its how they have done it,  at every turn they make the economy more brutal.  They introduce wear and tear on your rods and reels, now they have even started to nerf DLC content, yes stuff people already spent money on is being rebalanced???  Why so they can sell a new replacement for it!!!  Your premium currency formerly Gold has been readjusted to baitcoins...  and they same things you could have purchased with you gold 10 times over you can now only afford once after the transition from gold to baitcoin.  Even the tournements are broken, 2 fishermen do not have equal odds to win, it depends on who has spent more money and has the better gear?!?  Fishing Planet is a game that had tons of potential that is now nothing more then a slow agonizing grind, you need to be an accountant with HR Block in order to navigate all the travel fee's and licensing fee's and then you have to have a plethera of time on your hands in order to catch enough fish to pay off all those fee's.....  There is no casual fishing as any fishing trip in the game demands a commitment of time just to break even.It possible things could change in the future, the game seems to change and update frequently, but most of the changes have been in the wrong dirrection.  And for that reason I cannot recommend this game and suggest you check out IceLakes instead....  while its only Ice Fishing its a fair more enjoyable experience!			"

								Okay.This game is the most fun I've had in any fishing game so far. Seems like there is a fair bit of expansion to be had, and I'm thrilled everytime I have a bobber drop.Don't get me wrong. This is a bit of a waiting game, but fishing is about either finding fish or lucking up to hit that 10% of the water that fish reside in.Did I mention there are fish in this game, and you can CATCH them!?Great attention to detail as well. The black crappie I just caught looks like one I just caught last weekend.Edit as of 9/16/15This game is so relaxing I've started using it as a sleepaid at night. Its almost as peaceful as camping in real life, I just wish there was a volume mixer that was more than just music, and effects.			"

								""That's boring."" You're right, it isn't exciting, but you're missing the point. It's meant to be a relaxing diversion, and that it certainly is.The tutorials have recently been updated and have greatly improved the ability for new fishers to learn to play, too. I still recommend checking out some player-made guides and tutorials, but they're no longer vital.The thing that sets this fishing game apart in particular is how tactile the controls feel. The 'grind' isn't bad unless you want earlier unlimited access to new fishing regions, and the premium equipment doesn't appear to offer a real ""advantage"" over the common type. There isn't a competition or race. It's all fishing, and that's all I could ask for!While there could be many updates to be made in the future, it's pure shoreline fishing for the time being.Still Fish outta 10 Written at the time the game self-declared as Early Access, didn't leave Missouri ingame yet.

								I love fishing, I live in FL and fish all the time.  I've been dying for a fishing game that's worth anything since sega dreamcast was around.   I want this title to do well, this game has all the right ideas, all the things I would want in a fishing game.   Since it is early access I won't harp on game mechanics and physics as I know they will improve.  My biggest problem with the game is its just not fun.  Let me explain, in Fl in real life I go to a lake I can catch many species using the same bait by adjusting I how I present it to the fish, where I'm from bass,bluegill,catfish,etc,etc will eat a nightcrawler.  It may not be optimal but it happens.  In this game its not like that at all, I find myself searching guides after frustration sets in.  You then find to catch this species you cast in this exact spot, during this time period, with exact leader setting at this amount, using this exact lure or bait and then grind for hours using that exact setup.  There isn't really any rng.  Once you get the xp needed to reach next lake you then go to guides find exact spot and grind for hours on the next fish.  To me thats not fun.If you don't like grinding you can spend 150$+ of real money to get the better lures, and xp boosts.   I probably don't play this game mostly because of the costly dlc that comes out that you need to buy if you don't want to play for 12 hours a day to compete with others.   The very first day this game came to steam I spent 20$ for a weekly boost of some sort and it does not go by game time it goes by real time so it forces you to play alot to make it feel its worth it purchase.   I would rather this game be 40$ and come with all content then claim to be free to play.   Its free to play to get you in the door then when you feel the grind you pay out the A##.			"

								Turned from a great, fair fishing simulator to a pay to play cashgrab.... R.I.PIf you are on the 2nd highest level, have enough gold and cash, they simply add 10 levels ( where 1 lvlup needs more xp than 20lvls did together), raise ingamemoney-prices about 5-6times and convert your gold into ""coins"" (1000gold = 100coins) while the gold/coin-price stays the same.... thanks, but NO THANKS!

..:: HONEST REVIEW - NO BS AND A** KISSING ::..NOTE: Since this game is in EA this review will change with time (or not if developer keeps breaking his own game).MyScore: 4+ 

Gameplay: 6+/10
Graphic: 5/10
Audio: 6/10
Developer: 3/10Pros:- currently best fishing simulator on the market***- many fishing locations, fishes, baits, gear, etc.- sometimes can be fun,*** - best in genre doesn't mean good in general...CONS:- Since update 0.3.0 game is just unrealistic to the point where stuff breaks when it shouldn't or doesn't work like it should. Update brings a lot of nonsense to almost all parts of the game ultimately gimping gear, fishing mechanic and fish AI. - Update 0.3.7 doesn't fix anything (durability system is still broken/gimped, values for gear strength are messed up and so on...) and brings even more issues with bucket full of boring content. There is nothing more anticlimactic than small pond (which they call a lake haha) filled with pretty much same small fishes which are on starting location in this game.- Developer bans people for bringing up negatives about the game on the forum. They keep ignoring any negative opinions even when opinion is supported by loads of valid arguments and facts. Basically if you have negative opinion and you want to share it on the forum TO HELP THEM UNDESTAND WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE GAME YOU ARE VIEWED AS HATER. It doesn't matter how many facts and valid arguments is behind you .. you still are treated as hater whos ""supposedly"" attacking developer and they will remove you from forum. It's pretty much gaming version of ""Amy's Baking Company"" from Kitchen Nightmares.- Their Early Access statement is just one big pile of bs:""...our team is aiming to deliver the most realistic and fun sportfishing experience...""""...Our main priority is to ensure uncompromised realism of the fishing experience...""Update 0.3.0 is putting this statement to the grave.""we intend to use Early Access to polish everything out by fixing any bugs and introducing new features with the help of your feedback""They not only not polishing things they IGNORE feedback and push low quality/broken content while adding new DLC for 30-45 euro. Greed at it's finest....""...should take us approximately four months, with a full release planned for November 2015.""They claimed to have game polished in around 4 months... it's been 10 MONTHS and they not only didn't polished anything they also are nowhere near releasing this game. Game in current state is all over the place with bugs, gimped mechanics and psychics. Just mess... - Moderator deleting video evidence of game breaking bugs on the forum. Gives false excuses saying that my line broke becasue it was at 0% when in video clearly is on 94% and keeps talking about me not using ""pro"" meters which would show that my line is at low % which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t becasue its irrelevant what meter i use. The point is that small fish broke heavy line and it shouldn't happen so they want to hide it by deleting any evidence. Game is broken and it's reflected in 0.8kg fish breaking 3.6kg (and even 4.5kg) braided line like it's made of paper.Evidence:

			Fishing Planet - Update 0.3.7 In a Nutshell		

- Most of positive reviews is bogus and there are even threads on the forum calling people up to deal with negative comments. I guess they want to do everything to boost dying game.- Developer which doesn't understand how bad his development strategy is:FP lost most of initial player base and after 0.3.0 even more ppl just left.- Developer making fishing game doesn't understand how fishing gear and physics works.- Another developer abusing Early Access,- Only one server:Game server is located in NA so Europe and rest of the world is screwed by over 130ms ping causing game to lag,- Bad development decisions:They working on VR when almost no one can use it or can't afford it while delaying development of more important key components.- Quantity over Quality:They keep adding stuff without polishing audiovisial components and mechanics to setup solid base. They keep changing and messing up what was working fine.- Some sounds can get annoying to the point where you turn of sound or there are sound which shouldn't be there,- Recommended System Requirements are a joke:My specs are above it and on max settings i get avr. 25fps while facing water.- Outdated glitchy and average graphic: On low setting it looks like something from 2005. On full setting foliage still looks bad... only water and lilypads looks good but game cause PC to sweat like it's some freaking Witcher 3 or Crysis,Our ""avatar"" in the game is like some weird human shaped alien which glides above ground... Srly???!!! They could deal with it in a creative way... oh wait they aren't creative.- Graphic lag/Freezes/Client - Server lag: Basically everything from switching windows in UI, switching rods or people posting on chat cause performance issues sometimes to the point when you get 3-4 second freezes or you can't cast lure properly,- Complete lack of optimization:Game is so many moths in development not to mention 8 in early access and they still didn't optimize game,- Boredom caused by how easy to catch are biggest fishes:It ain't unique/trophy fish if you can catch 10+ of them in one IRL afternoon. Basically game spoils player with trophy and unique fishes being childishly easy to catch.- Grind:There is nothing funny in catching over 300 fishes all pretty much same size just to be able to move on to next level,- Boring  grind events:Basically grind based event where you spend few IRL days to get useless rewards,Lack of creativity is they key problem.- Irrational decision making:Basically they make decision which doesn't make sense e.g.  crankbait have damage indicator but soft plastic lure doesn't... rod is damaged while it's not even under load... and so on...- Rubbish, ridiculous and overpriced  DLC's with existing Pay to Win factor: Right now if you buy DLC you get mostly gear which is for free in the game + 3 rubbish skins for ONLY!! 45 euro... what a nonsense.Again lack of creativity is the key problem.FP developers: Good DLC is affordable by everyone even those who gain steam money by playing other games so 1.99 euro is perfect price which everyone can afford and support your game. On another hand balanced DLC have content which doesn't add pay to win factor and still brings something fun to the game, e.g. custom made crankbait's with regulated lip/weight or fishing rods with custom shaped handles and ""accessories"" on it + custom textures, etc. I do not recomend this game and play it only if you're desperate person. At first it can feel good and you can have a bit of fun but soon enough grind will kick in and all the bugs and glitches in the game combined with grind and boredom will simply make you angry to the point where you will uninstall. Only thing keeping this game alive is group of scrubs ready to spend 30 euro on DLC ;) My prediction: This game will end like Euro Fishing.			"

								Was fishing somewhere, did not play for a few days, now I don't have any more credits and therefore can't play the game any longer. Forum says: contact support and ask them to reset your credits counter. Sadly I can't find a way to contact the support. Even their website only says ""Play the game"", yea, nice joke, but no chance to contact them.Until that crap isn't handled, I have to say: nope, can't recommend that.So if anyone can tell me what to do, that would be nice./EditSo people told me the developers are ""pretty responsive"" on Facebook. Ok, I just deleted my Facebook account because of reasons. I don't want to go back. I have this game on Steam, the developers need to have a contact support system, like a mail address, or contact on the Steam forums, which they don't. Nowhere in the game or here you can even find out who developed this game. Other people tell me that I am stupid and should log in every day for the bonus credits you get this way. Good idea, I only need somewhat above 2000 credits, so by this method I would need... months of logging in into a game I can not play, just because the developers don't have a support system so I can't tell them about this bug a lot of people have, according the forum threads.So please stop calling me stupid or giving this review a thumbs down or calling me troll. I do liked this game, it was pretty relaxing, but I can not play it anymore because of some very stupid bugs, which are bugs and not game related things that I did wrong. It's a bug when you don't play a game for weeks and the game tells you after coming back ""Well sorry, you now need 2000 credits to play this game, but if you tell anyone on Steam they will say you are a troll, and by the way you can't contact us. Maybe on Facebook, where you just deleted your self. Yea, life sucks""			"

								I've recently started to play this game and it truly is a great game. That said, the latest patch that basically introduced pay to play is worse than a mobile phone paywall game. The leads on this game clearly have nothing in mind but cash and it's obvious, especially this early in development as they 'test' these paywalls. I'll update this if things change but : Great Game but will be basically locked behind a ton of your money.			"

								Total cash grab. Could have been a great game, fishing with friends online would have been awesome. You can't go two seconds without some sort of popup telling you to buy premium. Not only that but the fishing, although it has some accuracy, is for the most part arcade style and brainless. Put on the right bait and cast, and you catch the fish. Simple as that.			"

								I used to love this game, paid for DLC and all that .. this new patch has killed it. the random rooms are empty , kinda ironic as you don't ge to enjoy the new 3d models lol.. but a more important thing to Note: If you buying DLC from them, they will and have in this last patch removed DLC content such as the iron maiden keeper from holloween dlc. I loved that item  lol.. but who cares how I feel about it.. I paid Real Cash for it and others they have removed from the game. I did not get ""baitcoin"" or what ever it's called for the items I paid real cash for after the patch, I did not get the 100 extra coins as a gift.  I've sat down and worked out the math to double check this. based on their patch notes and the exchange rate they gave.. i'm owed several hundred more ""premium"" cash for the stuff they took from me.  this should be illegal. the people in charge of this games are low, dirty thieving jerks.. I know they have to pay for the game dev some how.. but stealling from your Dieing player base of loyal fans via removing their Paid Content is a ♥♥♥♥ poor excuse. Do not Trust this game or the people behind it.  side note, as a fishing game option, it is one of the better fish games out there.. but it's not worth the loss of real cash you might want to pay if you did like it.. and pay wall? holly crap.. i've never seen any casual fisherman ever pay several grand to drive to a lake to fish.. what the hell were you thinking.. even with todays gas prices lol.. wow..

								Fishing planet, Well where do i begin,some may say missouri... me i say from my childhood playing games by the likes of ""big ol bass"" and ""championship bass""to name a few, this is the kind of game i had been looking for, for years!Having read the ""roadmap"" for this game it sounds like it may fast become one of my favourite games of all time, now thats quite an achievment considering my gaming history.anyway, on to the game itself,in its current state its pretty darn playable considering its still in early acesswhen playing it draws on real life knowledge, like what habbitat does a perticular fish like, what food does it like, is it line wary or will it just have at anything going past ect.For me this firmly plants it in the Realm of actual Simulator, instead of those simulator wannabe games.Fighting a Fish: you actually have to fight it instead of just reeling in, lest you break your equipment or risk loosing the fish.The Tackle : Tackle variety is Decent in its current stat with many Baits,Rods,Reels,Line,Lures and much more(to unlock items you have to be the correct rank or higher (you dont have to pay for a thing to unlock it all))The World : the fishing planet world is based off of three main things currently; Level,Cash,Gold. You gain xp/levels for catching fish, the better the fish the better the xp, the same is said for cash which you use to purchase things like new tackle,bait,Licences and moving home to a new state should you wish. Gold is a kind of Special currency only aquired by catching really nice fish called ""unique's"" (you can also purchase gold using real money should you wish) you can use said gold to purchase special items, These Include : special baits, premium rods and reel's and better wearable equipment.MY experience in Fishing planet- having bought a couple of the DLC packs i thought ide have a look to see if anythings on sale considering its black friday, and i noticed there was so i decided to buy a 360 day premium pack, shortly after buying i noticed the pack hadnt apeared in my ingame inventory like normal when i purchased the DLC so i thought ide leave it a while since the servers had just come back up after some maintence, but still nothing, i thought it must have had somthing to do with the maintence that had just happend. so i decided to email surport and query what had happend. The staff responded Quickly, They are also really pleasant and profesional and after a few emails back and forth solved my problem. You can really tell These developers do Care about there players and about making there game better.I was pleasantly surprised by this considering the tarnish that some early acess games/Dev teams leave on players.Overall this is a really enjoyable game and i cant reccomend it enough to anyone who likes Fishing or even if you've never been fishing in real life but want to give it a try.Totaly worth the time and money ive spent on this game.

""The Best Damn Fishing Simulator Ever""	  Honestly I can't think of any fishing game I have ever played that was better.   First of all the game is absolutely beautiful, the environments are very natural and serene. The water dynamics like ripples and splashes in the water are amazing. Also there are many locations and over 34 types of fish with more of both to be added in the future.  The fishing is very realistic, sometimes you can almost subconsciously feel your mouse tremble as you see a nibble and set the hook. The fight of the fish is very satisfing especially with big ones, where battles can last over five minutes.  Fishing Planet is a very relaxing type of game that you can lose hours playing. It's one of those games that you don't have to be constantly at the keyboard. You can sit back and relax while playing or get up and walk around to strech your legs, go get a snack, yet your still in the game.  The game works on a level based system where you earn XP points by catching fish. As you increase yor XP, your level rises. Higher levels allow you access to better rods, reels, baits, lures and tackle in general. Higher levels also allow you access to the other locations where the fish get a lot bigger thus the need for better gear. The best kind of free to play model, you don't have to pay for anything. You can purchase three things with real money; in-game cash, a premium account which gives you increased xp for catching fish and DLC packs. None of these are required to play the game however. You have complete access to everything in the game for free, with the exeption of having to grind a little to earn the higher tier locations and equipment.  This game is in early-access which means it is basically an alpha. Which also means it is not completely finished and has aspects of gameplay not yet added like boats, free roaming and multi-player. These features will be added in the near future but the lack of them still does not undermine the playability of the game. Even without these features the game is still wonderful to play. It also has bugs and game mechanics that will be rebalanced as well. This is the nature of all early-access games. I played a few early-access games and this one is in much better shape than your average early-access game, try it for yourself.  In closing, Fishing Planet is completely free to play, is a small download about 2gigs and runs well on even lousy computers. Highly addictive and also very satisfying as well, what do you have to lose? Fishing Planet is an absolutely a must own game if you are any fan of fishing.  "

								The game is in ALPHA and yes there are tons of things wrong as far as bugs go but is is playable..After 60+ hrs in game I have to say it is a  SIM that has the normal grind for gear like all games do. With that said it is FREE TO PLAY (so why not play it?). IMO it's FTW=FREE TO WIN cause you can buy everything in the game with ingame cash that you get by playing!!!NO PAY TO WIN!! yeah sure you can get a prem account but that only gives a xp advantage.As for graphics is really polished and looks great! Sound gets abit dull and boring at times but its ok. So in the end is it worth playing yes for me anyways cause I am a fisherman and I know this is just a game and not real life..I give it a 10/10download it see what you think foryour self			"

								Best fishing simulator/game I ever played.You can play for free no problem, it just takes you a bit longer to reach your goals.Whenever I'm in the mood for fishing, but weather is too bad, season is just wrong, or health prevents me from doing it IRL, I can just get on here. Add a great community to that, and I got all I need.Is it good? I think so. 343 hours logged and about to add more.Are you a person that needs something to happen every second in your life? Then this is probably not something for you.  This is a simulator, not a fish-reeling game.But if you want to relax, join us with a rod and reel by the shores, and perhaps come on teamspeak as well for a good chat, and if needed, some help.

								It was fun for a while, but it bacame obvious after a few hours that they have tuned thru a recent update to make progress very slow. Low level fish pay a currency based on size. Catching bigger fish pays more currency, but are gated by tackle. This tackle is gated by level. You must pay currency to travel to fishing locations, and for example 220$ to go to the first unlocked lake. It took several hours of irl gametime just to nearly recoup the travel cost. So be prepared for alot of time invested if you want to advance without paying real money. The task is repetitive, based alot on chance, and even your victories aren't really rewarding. All in all i think its tuned to far towards long grind. You'll grow bored before you get to the fun parts. Good luck.			"

								I am a level 10 newbie, that being said, I want to go to faraway places and catch unique fish and not drain my wallet to get 5 fish. I used to fish in Missouri for about 225 credits and I could come out the other end with at least an extra $70 from catching catfish. Now they decided to downgrade the price to $1800 (did I say downgrade, I meant jack up by %800). Now, in order to gain any money from Missouri, you would hve to catch about 100 pounds of young channel catfish if you wanted to come out the other end with any hope of gaining money. What a shame because this game showed some promise, and, I bet, if they had not inserted these P2P and P2W schemes, people would have bought more DLC's because they saw that this game was a well-crafted, fair fishing simulator that was made for the purpose a game should be made, for fun. Now, If they wanted the option to allow players to donate with special bonuses (premium accounts), then I could understand, and there is no shame in making a video game for people and gaining money from it, but when you pull a theHunter on me, you can't seriously believe anyone will enjoy your game. If I wanted to throw away my money, I would have just gone to a strip club. At least then I would get some fun in the end. Game devs, if I could go back 6 months, I'd like to see how many times you slammed your head into a brick wall to come up with this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. the updates were for ""balance."" If I was on a tightrope I was your definition of ""balanced,"" I'd be ♥♥♥ up on the floor right now. All in all, I would have rated this gme a five out of five if they reverse all of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t they put in it.			"

								I have found heaven. Its a virtual fishing bank where the beer is always cold, the bugs never bite and there are no fish & game wardens.  The physics are really good.  Graphics are really good.  Gear is really good.  Its really good.  Each species seems to behave accordingly.  Bluegill/pumpkin seeds nibble and dart, bass confidently leave the scene of the crime as if nothing happened until you plant the hook and crappie run like hell, etc..  And I'm only mentioning a few of the species using bobbers with various leader lengths.  Did I mention its a really good fishing simulator?			"

								I'm hooked.All puns aside, I downloaded this thinking I'd delete it very quickly. However I started playing and that changed drastically. Not only is this in-depth (although I don't know much about fishing), but it's easily accessible and personally I find it very fun to play. It isn't an action packed game, but get the right techniques and you get rewarded for it. Reeling in big fish is an exciting struggle and you do actually feel good when you land it. It does have microtransactions, but if you play the game well, you aren't forced to use them, it encourages smart playing and research, which I find to be quite interesting. It won't be everyone's cup of tea, but it's free; so download it and give it a try, you may be pleasantly surprised! I know I'm excited to play this tomorrow.			"

								So I played this game for probably more hours in a couple of months than a couple of games I have owned for a year or two and I can tell you that alot of this time was fun. Until you get to the grind. If you are looking for a fishing simulator I would honestly wait for maybe a year and see where this game is in that time. Fishing isnt about catching and I dont believe the devs and many people actually realise this, its about the thrill of catching the fish, the fight and the thought that you have the chance to not catch anything or catch a fish that you can put in your personal records or the local newspaper. I am level 17 in this game right now and have caught hundreds of fish, If I was on a trawler boat sure I would accept that number but once you are grinding from what I have gathered 313 fish to get 25000 xp for level 18 to get to a new lake and actually catch some decent fish is rediculous, the process of getting this 25000 xp is pretty grueling requiring you to constantly fish the same old bass in the same old spot at the same old time with the same old lure with no real skill involved (promised dynamic fishing system not implemented). So the only way to get this XP is through ""Farming"" call it what you want this is not fishing its catching, when it gets to the point you are catching a fish every cast every day on the same lure it is catching, after a while this is no longer fun. When discussing this I have had the typical ""well go fish somewhere else"" ""stop calling it farming and you will eventually stop thinking it is a grind"". I am sorry but since I spent nearly a month in each of these spots ""farming"" it is boring and also ineficient as the lower level places give you less XP as you expect. Sure its a fishing game but not a simulation game like advertised which is sad to me. I thought the game would be fun and exciting after the new fish fights, It didnt. The only I see to really fix this game is to remove this XP system completely let people fish again, let them have fun, not every game needs to be about one upping people of stats, let people fish a spot and try to catch the biggest fish to drive a competition, lower the frequency of catches and the game becomes a fishing SIM the way it should be. Keep the money system and add more premium currencey tackle for revenue but please for the love of god dont turn this in to what everyone is comparing to a fishing MMO where it is no longer fishing. Even a license system like the hunter would do me but everyone knows that that would never work because funding a f2p game is a bad thing as as soon as money becomes involved it is p2p (Sarcasm)...

								Loved this game when I first started playing - great graphics, great physics, great ""Feel"" to it - you really do feel like youj're out there on the shore casting and reeling in, and when you get a strike you feel the battle with the fish. But...Then in the course of a day or two something changed. Where before I was pulling in a decent number of good-sized bass with my spinning rod and jigs, suddenly I go hours without a single bite. I went an entire 2 days of a rather expensive fishing trip not getting a nibble, on a lake that had always been super productive the day before, and yes I was fishing with the right bait, rod, reel, hook, and at the right time of day. I went from 3 dozen trophy bass in a few days to no fish at ALL.  Needless to say, it was obvious they had made a change to the game that decreased the number of strikes bigtime. To make the game more ""Realistic?"" Maybe. After all, who can really go to a lake and catch 20 23 lb bass in 4 hours? But you know what I have to say to that? If I want super-realism, I can get in my car and drive to my local lake and stand around for half the day casting and reeling and not catch a single fish. The reason I want a fishing GAME is so I can escape to a fantasy world where I can catch a lot of fish, unlike in real life where I basically suck at it! And no I'm not saying the game should be some easy joke where anyone can just grab a pole and catch a ton of trophy fish, no skills required. But for those of us who took the time to learn the right equipment to use, the right baits that work with the right kinds of fish, the right times of day, and the right techniques to use to catch each fish (stop and go, slow and straight, lift and drop, etc.) - we should be rewarded with good catches! And yes, plenty of them!Not sure if this is a temporary setback, or not, but time will tell. I can say that if the game mechanics have now been changed to the point where I have to sit around for hours at my monitor not catching a damn thing - just like in real life - then I probably won't play Fishing Planet any longer. Plenty of other games I can escape into for a few hours to get away from reality that provide the rewards I'm looking for in a game.			"

								****Update**** Ok really can't tell people to play this game when they make a game where you have to get licenses and obey the law and then when they come to Florida in real life they can't do the same including breaking federal law buy catching and keeping a  protected species. But the worse is the spin control of erasing my posts and others calling them out on it. No bans just poof posts gone. They should own up to it, apologize and move on. They did the fishing ,they posted the pics of them and fish. They need to own up to it. 


Announcement: Fishing Planet iCast Odyssey (teaser included) 
Fishing Planet, Aug 5, 2016

			Hello fellow anglers! As promised it is time for us to tell the story of our journey to the iCast 2016 show and how we explored the fishing America.		


I would not recondmend this game. The game has some redeeming qualities but since I am not endorsing this game I won't mention those few items.1) Yes it is free to play, at certain levels though it is pay to win because if you want in a tourny you have to be lvl 17+ in order to have access to tackle that will catch the target fish or a fish keeper big enough that will let you be competitive, So until your high enough level to get those items it is pay to win IF your interested in tourny's.2) Fish mechanics are horrible. Everything from how a fish strikes to the mechanics of the catch are pretty bad. When the game started there was a huge cheat inbedded in the mechanic that allowed for almost instant catches, ever since then they have been trying to ""fix"" it but it has never really gotten there, they should have scrapped the whole thing and started over.3) Super grindy (understandable to a point) but the game squeezes you into certain lakes ao it basically spend all your time for a big group of levels at one lake then when old enough move on to another....The worse thing is they DO NOT tell you any info but you not being old enough for a lake equipment wise. I lost over 6 hrs of play (making money) only to pay the extra to ""move"" to a new lake and find out that I couldn't catch anything worth while because I was not old enough to buy the ""magical"" bait that only the fish in this lake will strike lol..4) Going back to the mechanics...the fish are all caught in ""spots""  Yep, spots, no wandering fish no moving targets and although fish in RL are often caught in ""spots"" only when those spots are active ( ie that special cove you are lucky at alot is because the wind blows often into the cove, increasing the food chain and the fish will move into the cove following the increased food chain, when wind doesn't blow into cove, no fish in cove) So it would have been far more realistic to have either multiple spots that change because of weather except there is no real changing of the weather( you have 2 weathers rain and no rain) OR just have fish wander all over and not have any stupid spots since they couldn't realistically simulate the other aspects of fishing like weather and water conditions.5) Now to squeeze out more money they have an equipment damage, destroy and repair system. Which is horribly stupid. I have been fishing with the same 3 reels and 3 rods for 25+ years ( I am in my 40's) I understand they need to get paid this is thier job BUT... Picture this... you pay 250 in game currency to do a few days of fishing somewhere. You forgot to repair your pole or lets say you want to goto new york and fish pike which will eat your pole alive. It is possible to end up destroying your pole before your trip is done, wasting all kinds of money. Now yea it would be the stupid players fault for not paying attention but moments like that should never happen in a game....NEVER...and no it did not happen to me but was the first thing I thought of when I played with the damage system for the first time.6) The game is full of ""non-explanatory"" moments. No in game pop ups or stuff to help keep a player from making mistakes like going to a fishing hole too early in level or joining a tourny that your too young to have the ""tools"" to compete. You WILL eventually waste money on something and have a ""wtf, nice of you to tell me"" moment. How uch time/money wasted will be different but sooner or later you WILL make a mistake somewhere, even if it is buying a lure that won't fit a pole...(yes only certain lures on certain poles)7) Which then brings me tooo...certain poles/reels ect.... This is a major say whaaaaat moment. For starters you can only bobber fish from a ""special"" pole which makes me giggle becuase NO ONE uses these poles in RL. They are alot like the old style bamboo poles as kids we would use in that they are really really long. But these things have reels. Basically the whole idea that I cannot take 2 poles (one 6 1/2 foot spinning set up and one 7 1/2 foot casting set up and fish with that everything and use every type of lure/bobber ect is just re-tarded. Other than special things like here in Oregon fishing pike or salmon you need steel leaders, salmon you need a very stout pole (think deep sea size pole). But other than a few specialty fish you can fish for over 30 ""game"" fish in this country using the same two poles I mentioned above.I still play every once in awhile to scratch an itch but casting in the same spot 150 times in a two hour period is just not fun. Not using my brain to figure out where the fish might be, is not that much fun. So when I do play its usually about 15-30 mintes because after that I want to hang myself with some spider wire.What they could have done to make it better:Real fish movements based on weather,time,moon phase.Real fish actions after hooking.( not enough variety)Total openess in fishing tackle I can buy and what set-ups I can use.NO DAMAGE SYSTEMNO magical fish spots.Find another way to make money other than breakage ect. Tourny's for ALL players broken down by level brackets with fish that CAN be caught by lures ANY player can buy not just DLC items like tourny's are now unless your old enough.Sorry but I really hate the whole pay to play feeling hiding behind a mask of well ""if you level long enough you can play in those tourny's for free without the DLC"".....You shouldn't let a player join if they can't fish it and be competitive against others.....

								Ok so this is my first Steam game review. This game is so good I am spending part of my Fishing Planet time to write this. I love everything about this game except one thing, which i will get to. First the pros:  1. The amount of details the developers put into this game is unreal. Every fish species has its habitat you have to fish for it in just as in real life and the habitats are true to life. Even the action of the lure you are using is a big factor just like real life. Same with the bait. Just like fishing in real life combine all those factors and execute your cast and retreival properly and you may have a chance at the fish your hoping for. Odd are though, that it will be just another Bluegill.2. For an early access game, in my experience this has the least amount of bugs, personally I haven't experienced any.That being said I have heard in game that others have been experiencing visual glitches. As for game mechanics, i have heard nothing. 3. The graphics are quite decent and doesn't bog my graphics card down much, if at all, and im running max settings on an old NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460. The water looks good, pretty realisic. The only thing i would say is add a little more such as the occasional fish jump and more to the fishing gear section such as sunglasses. So if your wearing polarized shades you can see past the glare and be able to see the fish underwater. I know that would be a lot to add but it would just improve the overal appeal of the game and add to the realism of the fishing in this game.The only con is the license system. Now i know this game revolves around realism but come on, the only thing worse than buying a license to fish in real life is buying one in a game. Every. Time. You. Go. On. A. Fishing. Trip. Unless you wanna spend an absurd amount of in game money for several months worth of fishing. Here's the thing, I live in Upstate New York, The We'll Charge You For Everything Except Taking A Shi%, Oh Wait We Charge For That Too State. and i only have to buy one once a year. And only for a measly 20 bucks at WalMart. I am just glad they don't make you pay real life money for in game licenses, or else i wouldn't play. But catching fish doesnt earn that much money especially when fishing trips in game are ridiculously expensive coupled with expensive fishing licenses. But if i wanted to not be able to afford to go on a fishing trip i would just shut off my computer and sit at my desk and not go on a fishing trip. Lower the prices of travel and licenses, but if you want to keep the prices so expensive have the fish earn more money seeing as that is your only source of income.Other than that i love this game and i would recommend it to anyone and everyone. I know some random guy's rating doesnt matter much but ill give it a 9/10, and if the income and/or prices change for the better ill change it to 10/10.			"

								Well, I played this game for almost 100 hours then it got very boring and i had to farm to level up. Then the new update with the new AI, fight mechanics and of course the new strenght meter came. It got waaay worse than it was before and i stopped playing. I came back to see what happened and yet every single fish escaped for low line tension (even if it wasn't low) and i had to fight a 1 kg trout for like 15-20 minutes. It was the best fishing game and the devs ruined it with the new updates and I'm sad because i really liked this game. :(			"

								Was addicted to this game, racked up 209 hours of game play in a little under 2 months. They increased the cost of everything, unfairly converted your gold (200 gold = 20 baitcoin now, wtf? ) increased the cost of licenses by 10x, just plain ruined the game.Fish and lure behavior completely ridiculous now, gotta pay to ff time... On and on. Do something better with your time then spending it on this ripoff.UPDATE:Had to add this. From the early access section on the store page.Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?“The game will stay Free to Play but the starter-packs and in-game purchases WILL COST LESS IN EARLY ACCESS, in comparison to the final full-version retail prices.”How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?“We will have an intense and fruitful Forum interaction between the development team and the Community as well as weekly Twitch Q&A sessions that help us gather ideas, feedback, and any possible bug issues.We perceive the Fishing Planets Early Access community as one big family that is helping us shape the game’s evolution and prioritize the development process by giving their votes in support of certain features and ideas.

A perfect game for relaxingLast time i played a fishing game it was on a PlayStation console. Since then i couldn't find any fishing game which would be interesting and fun. Fishing planet combines simulation with arcade and the result is pretty good. The game is realistic enough to keep you playing, try different baits and lures, time of day etc. and it's arcady enough to be fun for casual players.Gameplay is pretty basic, you choose the lake or river, pay the money for transportation, buy the licence and go fishing. The are countless baits and lures, rods and reels. You choose the correct ones, cast the rod and wait. If your equipment is low level it can break very fast, but if you use it correctly it wears pretty slow. You can buy equipment to store more things (you can take limited amount of things to the lake with you).What i don't like is the licence system. I'll try to explain. There is in-game time, you arrive at the lake in early morning and time slowly ticks while you're fishing. You also must buy a licence with in-game money, but licence are valid only for the time you purchase it(1 day, 3 days etc. You can buy unlimited licence but it cost crazy amount of money) so if you purchase a licence for 1 day it is valid for 1 day in real time while game clock stops when you quit the game. I think this is not fair. People after work don't have much time to play, they purchase the licence and play maybe for an hour in the evening and the next day the licence expires. I think licence should be tied to in-game clock and licence time should freeze same as in-game clock when you quit. If developers want money they should make and sell new lakes as DLC instead of items or boosters.This game is free with in-game purchases for real money, so i guess this is the reason. Developers want people to buy licenses for real money. Anyway you still can fully enjoy the game without spending real money. Leveling is very slow but it wouldn't be fun to level up fast in my opinion. If you're short on money you get some each time you launch a game and there's free lake where you can farm money and exp.The graphics are acceptable, it could use some work. There are maybe 10 or so maps which are very small so it shouldn't be too difficult for developers to make them look better, after all you stare at the same environment for hours so it would be nice if it looked better. game runs steady 60fps all the time. Water on the other hand looks amazing and realistic. Well you kinda expect that from such game anyway.Developers made a good work on the sound department. Sounds really add immersion and make you feel closer to the nature.All in all the game is really fun, a perfect game if you want to relax and listen to the sounds of nature. Try it, it's free :)Pros:Great performanceYou will not get bored after 5 hoursGreat variety of fishConsIn-game purchasesLicence system			"

								One of the best fishing simulators I have played in a long time. Many modern aspects of fishing such as the licenses, locations, and all the stuff you can buy in the shop are amazing. The variety of both fish and shop items makes this game actually fun to play. It requires a little patience but not so much that your waiting 10 minutes for your bobber to move. Developers definitely listen to the community and have added so much such as competitions and new items in the shop.			"

								5/23/2016Still hold out hope they can get things back on track but with each update it seems less and less likely. Before update 0.3.0 back in March this was without a doubt my favorite game and I played it any time I had a bit of free time to do so. After the update though the new fishing mechanics were/still are so unrealistic it’s more frustrating than it is fun. You’ll literally fight a fish for hours in game and hope that after all that work that this 5lb fish doesn’t completely spool your 30lb line in the end like it’s a shark or whale. I’d hoped they would fix this and kind of bring down to the level at which it was before the patch but so far we’ve still got these fish that are obviously on steroids. Never in my life have I broke a rod or reel. While they have slightly fixed this issue they still break way too easy in the game, I think we may be using glass rods and reels. They also made all gear wear out so now you need to repair everything pretty much constantly, which eats a good chunk of the profit you earn.  The only logic I see here is they wanted people to have to purchase more in game currency as before you could play the game 100% free (buying a membership grants you 50% increased experience so I always had a membership for the boost and to help support the game) with no issues. You still can but the less experienced/new players really seem to struggle now.Two good things that came in the patch were the gear matching (however the way it’s setup means that having max rod slots is all but mandatory to avoid constant gear swapping) and they fixed the right mouse button spam that plagued the game. To be completely honest I wish they would have just fixed the right mouse button spamming and left the reset of the fishing mechanics alone as they were fine. In the end it’s probably still the best fishing game out there however the player base has really dropped off in a short amount of time. I’ll keep hoping they bring the game back to its former glory but as for now I’ve all but completely stopped and I wont recommend the game in it's current state as the fun factor just isn't there anymore like it was before the big update.**Updated 1/4/2017**Stopped back to see if any progress had been made to fix the game and came across the Beta notes. Seems the Devs have decided to make some changes to things that may have helped the game. Instead of removing the level caps to lakes they've increased the level cap while also limiting what you can get XP for (no longer for achievements). They are getting rid of Gold finally AND replacing it with BaitCoins, which appears to be the same thing only harder to get without spending real money, imagine that!! Permanent licenses will be gated behind BaitCoins, ggwp Devs. Forwarding time will also be gated behind BaitCoins... Basically everything that was good about this game has now been changed or is behind a paywall. Good lord this game used to be so good, it makes me sick to see what the cash hungry morons have done to it.			"

								If you want to be able to post any comments about the game that might be negative based upon over 700 hours of playtime.. I would not recommend it... I was banned from the forums for making comments that are not nearly as negative as others in this game.  The reason given was that .. ""my opinions do matter"".. even though i claim they do not.. WEll if they do matter... then i would not be banned.. But I am.  Of course, as one player said... we should be happy to be able to speak at all.. bc in some places people are punished for this.. especially Women.... well i can understand now.  It is very sad that as a player that has purchased almost every possible DLC, in further support of development of the game.. of a development team that has grown by money paid by people such as me, from 5 to 20 members, would ban a player for making comments negative.  I have played more than 700 hours in this game... and i can't comment about anything.  The game could be great, if they actually allowed people who have played to make comments, if they actually decided also to update the community in steam about progress... where the game is based.  However, they don't update you in steam either.. none of this development team believes it is important to update the community in the forums of steam.  Instead you have to go to a radio show on twitch if you want to find out any information one that lasts hours.. or, also, if you would like to participate in the beta of this early access game.  This is very sad given that it is dedicated players like myself who would like to see this game succeed... They should think about how they treat customers.  They allow moderators... not even in development, to close threads of discussions as they see fit, and to ban permanently members who have been loyal customers.  It is hard to say i do not recommend this game but my feelings about these issues seems every day more to cloud my opinion...I still love to fish.. and it can be a very nice fishing simulator.. too bad the team making this game does not think more of their customers.

								STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME I agree with most of the negatives, this was a great game that didn't make you feel like you have to pay for stuff now this is just fishing for your wallet(fishing pun).STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME till they wise up(Not gunna happen) or a another developer makes a fishing game, all these people did was see they had the only game on steam worth a ♥♥♥♥ if your an angler or enjoy fishing games. im an angler in real life I can tell you half the money they want to play this game or buy DLC can buy me alot of fishing gear in real life $50, $60 and $70 bucks for half ♥♥♥♥♥ DLC thats as much as  AAA games coming out! We need to be smarter than this. The game is in early release as well that means they could still go for your butt-hole if they wanted, I bought DLC and some of it is gone, that doesnt feel good.(yes im mad) thats my fault i know.

								The best fishing sim I've played. Not perfect, but absolutely better than the competition.Pros:Immensely diverse range of tackle, gear and baits. This is kind of a double edged sword as the depth of options makes for a steep learning curve; selecting the right gear for the right species is problematic, especially for starting  players. One needs only to take note of the subject matter within the in game chat channel--this almost invariably consists of players asking 'which hook/leader length/area do I need to catch X fish'. That said, I don't think the brevity of tackle options should be considered a negative. This balanced a little bit by the number of guides and info videos available online--most of what you need to learn can be gathered pretty handily outside of the game.There is a wide vvariety of fish to taget and while most do share similar rig preferences, there's still enough nuance required in order to land trophy and unique specimens which makes for good challenges.Calender events serve as a way for players to catch fantasy fish which are worth fair amounts of in-game currency, which can be used to purchase the best gear and baits. Nothing is locked behind a paywall, although special offers do come along seasonally which gives people the option to purchase extremely high end gear at lower levels--in this sense, the game is technically pay to win. Fighting fish is a fun, and unlike Euro Fishing, the physics which govern these are intuitive and intelligible;  striking, reeling and lure retrieval mechanics are all well concieved  and work consistently, and solidly. The graphics are pretty good for an in dev game, ambient noise is realistic, and the locales are pretty enough to look at.Cons:Perhaps ironically, Fishing Planet is possibly too realistic. Missed strikes, incorrect rig, lure and bait choices can result in lots of time spent winding or watching a float bob for no result. It pays to do your  research before heading out. It is also quite grindy; levelling is slow especially in the teens, and this is exacerbated by the fact that gear access is level restricted. In order to catch fish which yield worthwhile cash and experience  relative to your level, you often find yourself needing gear you can't access. The result is that you wind up grinding out fish which are no challenge to catch, and yield little rewards and experience.It's a bit off kilter and hopefully the devs correct this in the future as this is probably the biggest, and most monotonous flaw in the game.As far as I can tell, unique and trophy fish seem to drop at inconsistent rates depending on the species. Trophy catfish in the starting area are common, yet you can expect to reel in dozens of bass before landing a trophy specimen. Post patch, alligator gar have become impossibly rare, whereas unique redear sunfish are caught hand over fist. It's a broekn system which requires an overhaul.Overall, and  considering that Fishing Planet is pre-release, it's definitely well worth playing. The foundations for something great are all there, It just needs some refinement. And there's enough to keep you interested in the interim.Score: 6/10			"

								Hate to write this because it was my favorite game ever, but I played this game everyday for about 3 months, I even bought 2 dlcs. I quit playing for a couple of months, came back and they have just made it too hard to play without it draining your money, they have jacked up the prices to travel, prices for liscence, bait, tackle, and now even charge for things that they didn't before. I didn't mind spending money on dlcs and a premium account before, but forget it now. Its a shame because this was an excellent game, I hope they figure out that they messed up and correct this, but sadly I doubt they will. It all boils down to GREED.			"

								This game was the most fun for the month that I played  it, but after the STUPID update man, this game is a poo poo dumpster trash game. Can't land anything, all your equipment, I MEAN THE BEST REELS IN THE GAME, can't hold up to a 3 lbs fish? WTH? This game is not realistic, how could it be? I still have my reel from when I was a kid a freakin ZEBCO 202, bought it for 10 dollars in 1970? I reeled in catfish with that night after night, and after cleaning it up ready to go again, so how is this update realistic? I never EVER had to balance lures and line and reels, if I wanted to fish with a bobber and a spinning rod, GUESS WHAT, I did it and you know what else, I CAUGHT FISH!!!  Bad update sorry to say, and this game will die out UNLESS something is done and things are reversed!			"

								This game showed a lot of promise when I first tried it out.  I opted to set it aside and wait for it to be completed.  That was quite a while ago and it hasn't made much progress since.  Now it looks as if it is going to be pay to win with microtransactions and I absolutely will not support a movement that is ruining gaming for consumers.  Make a good game worth paying for and I will gladly pay what it is worth.  But if I'm going to spend my money on fishing gear, it's not going to be virtual.   "

								While improvements has been made to fix the broken massive-update, which broke the physics and made extreme slow-downs, I still can't recommend it. It is not relaxing and exciting to actually fight on to catch enough fish to pay for the licenses and fees and continuously fixing the degrading euipment. It's not fun, especially that they now further nerfed the biting ratio of the fish and it seems like the peak times are short  and the fish stops biting abruptly, right after peak time is over. People need to rely on youtube videos to go to a new place and immediately start fishing exactly as the youtube video instructs them, because they are afraid that they gonna run out of money if they don't cacth the necessary amount of fish to keep them playing. This isn't fun, but a crazy grind and every single fishing lake is reduced to a 4m^2 spot, where everyone fishes at a given hour to catch a few trophies and uniques. Nobody cares about the rest of the lakes and rivers, nobody cares about the bush and trees. Your game is basically a few tiny spots to fish for the fish now , that gives the most xp and money, nobody cares about the rest of the fish and nobody really cares about what other lures baits out there, beside the most effective ones.  90% of the lures and fishing gear is irrelevant. 90% of the fishing spots are irrelevant and uneccessary90% of a game-fishing day is irrrelevant and unnecessary.90% of the fish are irrelevant. After a while everyone figures this out and the game is reduced to about 5 fish worth to catch with about 5 different lures and baits and that's it. Befor you judge others or me, I have paid over $30.00 in DLCs, that's pretty much the full price of a finished game, and this game is still early release. Fishing is suppposed to be fun, not a struggle.  Unless the developers aiming to make a survival game and the players have to depend on their wallets to survive.  It's a quick way to become unpopular, if you ask me. This review gets updated,, whenever any updates applied and changes the gameplay to either direction.			"

								So this game used to be very enjoyable.  You could casually fish, relax, pass time, and move from place to place with a little work.  The F2P model was good, and I even payed some money to support and buy some gear/tackle or lisences.  But the latest changes destroyed the game for the casual player, and really felt like an all out cash grab.  Advanced licenses require real money, travel costs from lake to lake dramatically increased.  Now playing feels like an all out grind from the get go instead of an enjoyable progression.  It really did have the potential to be a great fishing game/simulator, but at current build is a game fueled by greed on the developers part imho.			"

								Advertises Multiplayer and Co-Op capabilities. These are not currently part of the game, therefore negative review. I understand that this game is in Early Access, and because of this it can't be judged in the same way as a fully released title, but if it was at least mentioned in the store description that multiplayer had yet to be implemented I wouldn't mind. But the fact is that multiplayer is advertised in several locations on the store page, even though there is literally no sign of it being even close to available within the game itself. Therefore, negative review for false advertising or clickbait, whatever you want to call it.			"

								I was somewhat skeptical about this game at first due to the free-to-play model, since F2P games have catfished me one too many times and most modern fishing games are pretty crappie. As it turns out, Fishing Planet is a kick bass simulator that has hands-down the most in-depth modeling of fishing as a whole. Licenses, catch/keep systems, leader lengths, tackle box storage, real and artificial baits...it's all here. Everything from fish activity cycles to river drift is modeled in a way that's accurate, but still fun enough that you won't want the developer's head on a pike for making something that's as slow as the real thing is sometimes. The early game can be annoying since panfish are near-worthless for leveling up and will often make it difficult to get at the more valuable channel cats, which is a load of carp, but once you get over that hump, your options quickly open up for gear and species, and fights can become really cutthroat. I played a lot of fishing games back on the NES/SNES, and even for someone as pickerel about their fishing games as I am, I'm enjoying Fishing Planet a lot. ...salmon.			"

								Sadly it was one of best fishing game when it was starting in 2015. Now after recent update turned up to be typical money grab. Before u could just chill daily for 1-2 hours and fish on your favorite spots nowdays people are asking around for specific fish to make up for all travel / lures expenses (not to mention baitcoins and gear that it exclusive to that currency - after update u can't get any of those from unique fishes as it was back in times) .

								Up until the newest patch this was a good and relaxing game to play, to gain vitual money and xp was a little long as both are needed to go to better areas and get better equipment but this was acceptable as you could hone your skills and tecniques. Now the new patch is here and they have increased the fish IQ which now makes the fish unrealisticly intelligent. Now they can remove the bait off your hook without causing a disturbance to your float, when you do manage to hook one they race off to the weed beds and wrap your line around the weeds which snares your equipment, leaving you to try and rescue your equipment while the fish saunters off giving you the preverbial 2's up. Let's be real Devs....fish are thick, don't give them something they never had in the first placeNow your equipment deteriorates at an alarming rate...how can throwing nylon line into fresh water once knock 1% off it's durability, salt water possibly...maybe. I assume the reason why they have now changed players equipment to be made of tissue paper is so that people will spend more of their hard earned in game cash, which now is even harder to get as you can't catch fish to sell.Well done Devs you have done what all other failed computer game creators have done, listened to a very minor group of annorak players and broke the cardinal rule, DONT TRY AND FIX WHAT IS NOT BROKEN !!Due to this recent patch you have lost alot of players, maybe you will see the errors of your ways and change things back making this enjoyable and playable again,if not then I wish you well in the pits of obscuredom which is now where this is heading.

								This used to be a half way decent game, but after the update it has turned into a complete money grab. You can see this when you leave the area where you were fishing and it tells you that if you had premium, you could get a lot more in game currency for the fish you caught then you would if you dont have premium. Another place where this crap is shown is how the game makes you pay even more in game currency to be able to keep (and in turn exchange for credits) fish that make the fishing worth while. P2W			"

								Great Simulator, Nice Progression, But The Grind Is Real+ Does a great job of simulating and the best fishing game around+ All 3 different types of lines (Mono, Fluoro, Braid) all have their strengths and weaknesses but overall the lines are balanced+ Nice Progression System+ Grind is Not that Bad (until you get to level 16+)however the bad parts to the game a few issues with bugs such as the teabagging in Florida or the game giving me frame drops a second before i get a bite to help tell me ""hey i'm getting a guaranteed fish on the next second"", and finally the fish flying around in circles at times when you go to reel it in.the grinding is pretty acceptable that you don't need to get premium so long as you have the skills and the patience to grind.. However when you get to level 16, the grind is so unbearable that the developers have basically forced you to want to get premium beyond level 16 as the xp scaling is so much. At this point the fish give between 45-60 xp per fish and the next level requires 15k xp and you only make about 3k xp per game day. At this point it takes you 3-5 real world days just to go from level 16 to 17. and from level 17-18 (requires 25k xp) it will take you 5-7 real world days aswell, making the grinding so painful at this point without premium. it took me 3 painful days just to go from level 16 to 17 and when i got to level 17 the xp gain did not even improve so i am either forced to get premium at this point or endure the pain of grinding. at this point i have decided not to continue playing the game as i would have completed it without premium but the grinding is just unbearable now that i can't sit there and grind so hard to gain one level per week.so take your time with the game because when you get to level 16 be ready to shell out for premium.

								Fishing planet is the ultimate relax experience. Moreover, despite being F2P is not by any means P2W and not repulsive in graphic/simple stupid gameplay terms.In fact, graphic is nice and close to imitate realistic pond and everything you can find around it- logs, plants, boats etc. Audio is calm and minimalistic. Besides intro music (which is great) there are only sound effects which is actually a great decision as it fulfills the calm and silent atmosphere of fishing contemplation. Birds, water and mosquitos are the perfect background to sit back and chill out.As for gamplay it is really more complex than throw and tow. You get yourself into two main ways of fishing- spinning and angling. Spinning is where you go for the fighters and predators. You must master several techniques of spinning as different predators respond differently to given bait and its movement.When you get tired of fighting you can take out your angler and do some peaceful casting for some less fierce fish. There you have to know what given fish likes to eat the most, where they hide and at which depths. There is a lot to learn and fishing blind and random will result in small blue basses. When you do your research and come prepared, you will get comparable results with big largemouth basses and heavy catfish as there is very little randomness in this game. If you know what you are doing you will get results making it very high commitment-high reward game. It will never make you feel you lost your time, even when you pour many hours into it.I covered barely some of the aspects of the first fishing place, there are more really challenging lakes as well as more types of fish to catch. Although being still in early access, game provides countless hours of fun and relax and there is lots of competitive stuff planned for the future.Moreover its free, so you can try it out with no money loss. Although when you try it, you will feel that the devs deserved some monetary gratitude for their tremendous work that is far superior to good ol' Trophy Bass series in every aspect.			"

And turned up the prizes on everything at the same time?!?

								As far as a fishing game goes, the ""game"" outweighs the ""fishing"" portion by a large margin. It seems to be all about slowly building up your gear with incremental upgrades at prices and stats that are set with only competetive balance in mind. The gameplay itself is very simplistic and doesn't feel very natural. There is no walking around a lake or getting in a boat- you pick one of two or three spots on the map and you'll be teleported to that particular ten square feet of shoreline where you can clumsily sprint to the water's edge and begin ""fishing.""  It's never difficult to tell what the developers are focusing on in a game, particularly when the game is in Beta. In Fishing Planet, you can loot through the tutorials to quickly see that there *are no tutorials about how to fish* but instead only tutorials about how to navigate the menus and buy new equipment. Equipment, mind you, that is most easily obtained through DLC. You didn't misread that- the game which isn't even out of Beta yet is already charging for extra content. Yeah, that's what the world has come to. You'll spend more money on this game that you would just buying a rod and reel and going to your local pay lake.  So what about the fishing game mechanics? Well, there are a couple different cast types, but I had to figure out how to do them through the in-game chat because there are no key mappings to look up, nor are there tutorials for the game itself. There is no way to adjust the strength of your cast and there is no player skill involved in casting. The bobber appears to be giant and really messes with your depth perception because it seems to always be the same size regardless of it being in your hand or out in the water (which I believe was intentional so you could see it better in the water). But doing that is a moot point, because there is a torrent of meta information always flowing to you that the game insists you should have, such as a large display showing your bobber and the water level on it, as well as information about reeling in your lure too early. The process doesn't feel very developed, and the mechanics themselves are extremely lacking. Any chance they'll work on making the game flow better or flesh out the base gameplay mechanics? Not likely, they seem to be solely focused on adding new fish to the game and new items for the in-game market, like fireworks that you can set off.  So yes, it's a game. Is it fishing? That's debatable. I don't have a problem with develpers looking for a profit, and that's not where my complaint is. My beef with the game is that the CORE GAMEPLAY has taken a backseat to the in-game market system, and that sets the tone for the whole development process. What you see now in gameplay is likely what you'll see as a finished product, and there are hundreds of fishing games out there that offer better fishing mechanics. Pro Bass Fisher for Windows 95 was a great one, and honestly beats this game in every aspect but graphics.			"

								This can be a great game if...its not pay to win. Eventhough its free to play, i will definately buy this game and its next series if the game developer stop making money from selling their ingame item, instead they should make a great DLC and sell it to customer. New player get nowhere with slow xp and good item as the game developer intended to do. Stop squeezing money from customer and give what they really deserve then this game will rise to be big tittle in fishing game			"

								Other than the small crash issues at the loadinga and quiting, I really wanted to enjoy this game. To summarize my short opinion of it so far:Pro's:- Brilliant Scenery!- Starts off slow, you'll need to have the patience to get to the Intense fishing before you really start to enjoy it, so hang in there!- Relaxing Music and feel to the gameCon's:- Limited movement space, the player has very limited space to move, which is surprising with the amount of places down the river. To move to a new spot, your basically having to do a 2 or 3 second load to that spot. Overall, there was not much point in adding Character movement. I was hoping for a bit more freedom in movement and allowing the player to explore the scenery beyond.- Crashing at the fist Loading Screen, Note: Don't Click or press anything whilst on the loading screen, If you get the Please wait pop-up. Then click please wait and it should eventually load.- Crashing on Quit..The crashes will obviously get fixed eventually though. :)			"

								I am really liking this game so far and I'm really glad I found it. Probably the one of the best fishing sims I've played. You can do most things you can in real life like adjusting drag, jerking your rod to get free from snagging some weeds, choosing where and what time to fish, etc. I'm not gonna lie, it'll take you awhile to level up and you'll probably be catching a lot of bluegills when you first start because certain fish needs a certain bait and time of day to get. Not to mention where you cast on the body of water and how high or low you set your bobber/leader can also make a difference. Took me some time to get to level 3 so I can get the casting spoons for bass but when I got them, it was worth it. There's also an in-game chatbox where other players can chat with one another. I found this useful. The majority of the community is just great in this game. I did however, run into a few people arguing on chat about irrelevant topics and a player who told everyone that they suck and he is the best fisherman on the server but most of the people are willingly able to help each other out if a player needs help or tips on how to do things. The game kinda tends to be a bit laggy at some times but not a lot. Anyways, with that being said, this game is still a great and relaxing simulator. It's free, why not try it out? :)			"

Early Access Review
								A wonderful fishing game thats a little rough around the edges.This is an early access review of Fishing Planet. As of this writing, the game is currently on version 0.3.8 with an average update cyle of one every other week. I also have 400 hours in this title since August of 2015. I am a liesurely angler and have only recently reached level 21 in game.Fishing Planet is what I would consider a pseudo-simulator. The primary goal of the game is to relax and fish, though tournament style fishing is planned. As anyone who has fished in real life would know, you're never guaranteed a catch. This is the main point where Fishing Planet leaves the ""true"" simulation. It must balance gameplay with realism, and as such, catch rates are generally higher than what you would find in real life. On the other hand, you are offered a wider variety of rods, reels, lines, tackle, bait and misc. equipment designed to target a range of fish in a range of situations. You then couple all those decisions with your retrieval style, such as straight retrieves, stop and go, lift and drop, among others.That being said, what is planned and what we have currently are two different things. If you come into Fishing Planet at this time, expecting a perfect simulator, you will be disappointed. Fish currently have spawn boxes and set times when they spawn. Venture your lure outside this box or through this box at the wrong time of day and you won't find anything. Fish randomization is something the devs are working towards but, for the time being, the same general strategy is required. There are guides and spreadsheets detailing where to cast, when and with what lure/bait that will, hopefully, be rendered completely obsolete in the near future.There is a leveling system in place to limit where you can fish and what fish you can realistically catch. You can't just hop into the game and expect to catch 20kg Muskie immediately. You'll first need to catch smaller fish worth experience and credits to level up and purchase new gear, as well as licenses to higher tier lakes. The devs have recently ended a test in regards to removed level locks on lakes, and as such, it may be removed on all lakes in the future. If that's the case, your only limiting factor will be gear. You will still have to earn your gear by leveling up or bypassing level locks by purchasing DLC packs focusing on certain gear types such as heavy float rods or ultralight tackle. These DLC are completely optional if you wish to take your time and fish.Waterways are currently limited to North America, specifically, the United States. However, there are plans for European and Asian waterways in the future. Fish species are diverse and dependant on where you are. Current species include, but are not limited to Gar (Alligator, Florida and Longnose), Bass (Largemouth, Smallmouth, White, Peacock and Striped), Catfish (Channel, Blue, Flathead), Panfish (Bluegill, Crappie, etc.), Pike, Trout, Salmon and more.Graphically, the game is beautiful. Water physics are a sight to see. Ambient noise is great though some lakes can be a tad bit annoying to listen to.There are some rough spots though. They range from physics (fishing launching into the air) to fish AI bugs (fish don't even bother fighting on ocassion) to equipment bugs (drag exerting tension on the line even when not under any load). None of them are major or game breaking, in my opinion. Your mileage may vary. I currently would recommend this title to anyone who enjoys fishing as a leisure sport. Perhap, once tournaments are added, more competitive anglers will have something of interest. Arcade anglers, however, I fear would not find this fu. There are no easy-mode toggles such as underwater cam, reel assist, automatic tensioners or the like. If you don't know how to fish from real life experience and are unwilling to learn the basics of how fishing gear works, you may find this a difficult title to pick up.Just remember that this IS Early Acess, which means things are always changing. As such, don't get too comfortable with how things are. If something is easy to exploit, expect it to be changed, if there's a bug, expect it to be fixed.			"

								A fun game, ruined by the latest update. Physics are terrible, controller buttons can no longer be modified, and the prices of everything have skyrockted to the point you'll have to pay for everything. I can understand in a Free to play game you need to make revenue, but this is crazy. I'd have gladly paid a moderate price to just buy the game, but the devs want $60+ per year to play, and that's not gonna happen. There's a lot of other great games out there I can easily spend my time with and never miss Fishing Planet. Goodbye....			"

								858 hours waiting to see  if this EA would finally take off and mirror the the boast of its creators. Sadly whilst graphically its 10/10 that is all it has going for it. As for realistic . Not even close. Now don't go on a hate rant I am evaluating the game on its description by the creators. Simulation od real life fishing. Come on guys who are you kidding it isn't even close. You cannot use the mosty used cliche ""it's early access"". Hooks that even Jaws would have trouble swallowing and floats normally used for mooring boats too. A game where every single facet is hinged upon the drag max on a reel!. How ridiculous.This game is doomed and it seems all the devs are interested in is putting more and more content in to a broken game. The rod reel physics have never worked from day one even if they have come a long way since the winch and haul method. Then comes  the cheaters  that were forewarned long before they arrived as in  all games some must win at any cost and pat themselves on the back for comfirming they are the lowest form of life breathing on the planet. How on earth do you expect to simulate a lake when there are no fish living in it. Spawn spots are not natural and are just pockets on a lake where 90% is devoid of any life. I played a 2D coded fishing game for 16 years and as a simulator it was spot on in every area and is still to this day the best fishing simulation ever produced.  It is a shame that despite describing themselves as fishing enthusiasts( reading between the lines meaning never picked a rod up in their lives) they do not posses the knowledge to make this game a worthy title. 6/0 hooks 30lb line with bloodworm as bait and being pulled all around the lake by a 15lb fish does that sond like a simulation of any fishing scenario any angler has ever had. The game is disjointed and a mess tbh. They are putting too many thumbs in too many pies and diluting what they have created. For a non angler it might occupy your time for a while but for any real life angler it's safer to stay on terra firma than engage this nonsense 2/10			"

								I've played this game for almost three hours, and by played I mean I've sat on the loading screen trying to get it to work for almost three hours. Nobody online seems to have any solution or advice for this problem, 0/10 fishing sim, 11/10 loading screen simulator. Think I'll stick to my local pond when I want to fish.UPDATE: While my time played now says 41 hours I assure that all 41 of those hours were spent on the infinite loading screen, thats right, i've spent almost two whole days just trying to load into this garbage. Once again no one seems to be of any help, an email sent to the developer after REQUESTING I EMAIL THEM THERE  went UNREPLIED to, and while the community did try to help they offered no new information other than what I had already tried. From some of the stuff I read about this game it doesn't sound enjoyable to begin with. Paying for rod and reel repairs just to make players spend their in-game money, really? As an avid fisherman I can asssure you rods do not need to be ""repaired"" regularly if at all with special exceptions such as a broken tip or guide, and reel repair? Just oil and lube twice a year and most decent reels on the matket today will last a lifetime. I wish I could not reccomend this more than once, I understand this is a game but they are marketing it as a simulator, so lets at least simulate accuratly shall we? You can handle big fish just fine on light tackle unlike this game would have you believe, also I've seen several ""tips"" while sitting on the loading screen that are just flat out wrong. If you enjoy this game, hey go for it, but if the dev's are gonna market it as a realistic fishing sim they need to try MUCH MUCH harder.			"

								This WAS a very fun and playable game if you like fishing.  However, I have to agree with my fellow ex-fans, in that, the devs have turned this game into a rigged slot machine where the house is the only one who wins. I have slowly and methodically been turned off by most of these ""updates""  over the past several months.  If that was intentional, GOOD JOB! I no longer play it or spend money on it like I used to.  If this was unintentional, my first question is,  Who the heck let the lunatics run the assylum!?  The things that were broken, barely got touched.. like the damage to equipment from general use, fish not biting after a certain rank or the totally useless fishing atlas for a few examples. One trip to a fishing spot in this game and the equipment is damaged with just about every few casts.  It was fun at one time..honest.PRO: I got to reclaim some of my hard disk space on my steam drive.			"

								This game used to be good a long time ago. But it is not now. I remember when I could come home from work and relax and catch fish on fishing planet. It was good times. Then changes,and more changes and now you might as well call it line throwing simulator because I guess the virtual fish has been fished out because I never hardly catch S**t anymore. It is a game, and should have some fun during the relaxing game play. But there is no more fun to be had.You sit for hours in game time catching nothing. This game is broken and I closed my wallet to it a long time ago. I do still come back to see if it is fixed and fun again but it just seems worse every time I do. I have a love for fishing planet from the past but a true hatred for what it is now.			"

								I'll post more when I can, but I'll be the first person to disagree with people regarding the updates.  Uniques and trophies should be just that, unique.  This update fixed that.  No more guarentees son, deal with it.  One thing I don't agree with is the durability, but it is what it is.  The updates added a lot more realism to the entire aspect, no more reeling in and just going ham on a fish.  Time to actually use speed, timing, and drag to wear that fish out.  All the keyboard warriors are upset about that, makes me think they haven't caught the big one or had the patience to deal with a lackluster day IRL.Take it easy, cast a line, and enjoy the damn game.

								Needed a break from Fallout and couldn't decide which game I purchased from this Christmas sale to download first - saw this and logged about 100 hours in a couple of weeks-for free. XP and dollars given for catching fish make leveling up and buying new gear interesting, good graphics, different locations unlocked with XP, dozens of kinds of fish - fun game. worth a look.			"

								With almost a full day of gameplay I want to start a first impression review for people both in the know how for fishing and new to fishing games (like me. Yep, I'm a CSGO/Team Fortress player, not a simulator/fishing player. BUT I've fished in my life time): Pros:  This is the first game in a long time that has had me ""hooked"" extensively. The gameplay is fluid and accurate. Stepping into the game I was expecting 1 of 2 things: Confusing and unnecessary game mechanics OR pay for the ""best"" equiptment as do MANY other fishing simulators contain. Starting and Controls: BOY WAS I WRONG. Off the bat the tutorial gives you the need to know basics for fishing in general which is easy to use and from experience really an amazing portrail of the sport in real life. After you understand the simple and relaxing controls you're off fishing on your own. Gameplay: USUALLY, games like this would start you off with fish in tiers (Example: Start bluegill, then catfish, then bass, and so on). However, you're able to start going for either bluegill, catfish, pike, or bass right off the bat. When it comes to fishing in this game, real world knowledge is amazingly potent in this game. A HUGE plus over other fishing simulators! Catching a fish in this game gives a SUPER rewarding and that's why I'm enjoying every bit of the game play. Market Model: There are free to play games I play without spending a dime but are annoyingly hard and VERY long to progress through where I just get burnt out and stop playing. Then, there are games where a majority of everything in the shop can be achieved... PURELY BY PLAYING!You don't need to spend anything to achieve special currency. Yep, ""premium currency"" is awarded through achievments and special fish. Yep, just like the games of old, you can unlock special stuff just by playing the game! DLCs? PSSSSH. Though their DLCs give you and edge early on, you can completely farm up to get all the items in the DLCs just from playing.Also, the in game currency is made fast with a bit of work BUT no where near grindy or slow as many other F2P models out there. This game's F2P model is a HUGE plus being a F2P player. Great job!!! Cons:   Lack of Variety and Content: One thing that slows you down is the fact that there's only so many fish you can catch. To many people this can bog down grinding and cause interest to droop off but it's what I expect from a game that just went into release. I know for a fact there's going to be A LOT more content to be added here such as tournaments, quests, missions, and more fish and equiptment. Though on the plus side to this there are varients of the current fish you can catch and personally that's good enough for an on release game. Grindy(ish): Yep, Grindy. Big surprise there from a F2P game right? Well, as to be expected. Every game with progression has a grind but I feel like this game handles it fairly well to a point. Upon reaching lvl 15+ there's a huge gap in exp gain that causes the game to really slow down. However, this is in place so the level split between casual and hard core doesn't grow too far apart.In all honesty this is a good move to prevent inbalances when tournaments get released. I would like to mention this is changing a week after this post to increase exp gain all around. The low level grind is decent up until level 10 and then you feel the monotonous grind thereafter. Like I stated! They're changing this in a week so this will change for sure! Entry Level Steep(ish): If you have experience fishing or used to fish like me, then you'll be just at home here. Like I stated in the pros, this game is SPOT ON with relation to real life fishing.However, if you're completely new to fishing, you might have a hard time getting started since every single fish has their own way of being caught. Though this can be a problem for a little bit, there's PLENTY of guides on youtube, guides here on steam, and help in game. Verdict:  Honestly, I went in with expectations set by many failed misses in the fishing game genre from years before but I'm knocked on my ♥♥♥ with how well this game came to rise up to what has been sorely missing in this genre of gaming. The F2P market is both gameplay derived and not pay to win, the gameplay is spot on and rewarding, the graphics are beautiful as all hell, the physics are nice, and importantly to the genre, this game is really accurate.Though there are kinks here and there with lack of content and poor entry level, this game hit the spot for an alternative to FPS, RTS, and Strategy games that I'm used to playing.I really hope the devs continue to keep the game in the positive heading.

Seems like it is nothing more than a cash grab.  A game with so much promise that was already enjoyable was just trashed.It is sad, but this is not the first time I've seen developers kill their own product because they don't understand their customers.

								Fishing, those young days with dad fishing on the bank. Oh to relive them.WAIT,YOU CAN .....Fishing Planet (but minus dad)Its the best looking and detailed fishing simulator I have played in a very long while. I have had played many in the past, and whats even better is that this game is completly free to play and own. You do not have to spend a coin, not a single one. (optional)Enough said, if you like fishing or want a stress free game without having to kill something every 2 mins then simply give this a go.Updates are coming in fast, the game is growing and gets better.Another fishing sim just got released costing money, I would avoid that one for now and stick to this..Its FREE.......

								I do want to go into to much detail why this game is good. just read this and download and you will see why!PREMIUM ACCOUNTS, PURCHASES AND F2PAre premium accounts obligatory to play the game at some stage?NoPremium accounts as all the other things you can purchase for real money are absolutely optional.You can play through the game without paying any real money. You will get anywhere and will catch all the fish there's available in our game. What do I get from premium accounts?With Premium account you get a 50% boost in experience you get per each caught fish for the duration of the account, a pack of licenses,a money pack. In simple words premium account just lets you level up faster.Is there any specific tackle or content I can purchase only for real money?No.Infact, quite contrary, there content you can unlock only by playing the game.So, do you have a membership?No.Premium accounts are more like boosters. And are optional.that right premium are optional so yes the game is free! fish while you earn.Sorry DTG Fishing step aside there a new king in town!			"

								Being a lover of fishing I thought that I would give this free game a go and I have now racked up  140 hours so far. I like the game a lot and there are many friendly people online to chat with in game that share hints and tips on the best times to fish.It can take a long time to level up if you do not have premium membership but that is part of the challenge and as you level up this unlocks better tackle in the shop for purchase so one day you can land that dream fish.The game also contains two types of currency; gold which is harder to come by but is earned by unlocking achievements or catching unique fish and silver which is the main in game currency which is earned from catching the remaining fish types plus also unlocking certain achievements.If you download this game and your a fishing lover you won't be disappointed.

								I liked that Game alot  until the new Update came online Today, they totally killed it. The Travel costs for any Lake are so expensive that you just cant afford it without buying real Money Currency, the new Time Skip Function is a Joke! Each Hour you Skip gives you a 5 Minute Cooldown, so this means Basicly that you are trapped for across 20-30 Minutes until you can skip the next Time and if the Weather is Bad you are many more frustrated because you dont Catch any Fish to Pay the Day to be there. Really 500 Currency Money for ONE DAY?? And those is the lowest Price there-.-. The Fish Catch Mechanics got changed by far, the Fishes bites 4-5 Times until they take the Bait or they just Disappear and stop biting. Me and my Friend was 1 Hour at Missouri in that Time we filledmore than 40 Pounds in our Nets and now after the Update Patch we filled just 20 Pounds. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ANYMORE ON THIS GAME.

								Well they wrecked it. It was a good game but now due to a poor update that has made it a look at the scenery rather than catch a fish with unstable rod and float or lure action. Travel costs make it prohibitive to learn a new lake as you spend so much money getting there and a huge daily fee that if you find a spot fish bite occasionally  you dont want to waste it.  All the money I have spent on the game and with this latest update they ripped it all off me. A monthly license for Quanchkin is 192000 dollars so I paid 500 bait coin for the unlimited..... bait coin i had was paid out at a 10/100 ratio 10 bait coin for every 100 gold so ripped of big time.  It has become a money grabbing venture by the devs who just dooo  dood all over their customer base. So summing up  fish dont bite no money coming in it costs alot to travel so choice is stay at free starter lake forever or buy in game cash with real money to play the FREE fishing game plus the insane amout it costs for rods reels baits etc.12 montha ago I would of highly recommended this game so sad what can happen in 12 months			"

								before lastest patch i would recommend this game. the game has became way more grindy, all gold that i had before the update has been changed to baitcoin at a ratio of 10gold to 1 baitcoin, you would think items would be cheaper, NOPE, infact it cost more. All the hard work farming uniques have became a waste of time, cant even farm unique redear's anymore to get baitcoin to buy better gear/bait.  Also all DLC that cost real money has been Nerfed, no one bit happy about that. Use to be able to enjoy the social side of the game with 20 people also fishing on the same map, but now lucky to see 1 person. I feel bored just waiting for a bite with no one to chat with.			"

								Free fishing game!  Thanks!Great looking graphicsLots of different fish to catchPeaceful music and soundsThe game is peaceful and a time passer, the fish are pretty easy to catch.  Fishing Planet helped occupy my two year old for a few minutes while he helped me catch some fish.  I got bored pretty fast on this game and do not think I will be playing it without my son.Edit:  I wanted to add that you can switch your tackle up, adjust drag, reel speed and bobber depth, travel to different fishing holes in a few states as you level up, travel to a couple different holes in each map, and adjust the time that you would like to be fishing.  Then once your there fishing you have very limited walking area allowing you to go from side to side on the shore for a short distance.I'm giving this game a thumbs up for what it is, a free time passing fishing game.

								This game is a conundrum. The graphics are beautiful, the effects like bugs skimming the water are stunning, the background ambience is incredible, and the actual gameplay stinks. They spent so much time making everything realistic looking that it feels like they forgot to allow time for the actual mechanics of the game. If you throw your line in the water and a fish bites at it, you have to wait for quite a while otherwise it says ""strike too early"" and you lose your bait. If you wait to long, it says something like ""Strike timed out"" and you lose your bait. The actual window, it seems, for being able to actually hook the fish is around 2.5 seconds out of the entire ""strike zone"". Add to that that it's nearly impossible to buy anything OTHER than bait like grasshoppers and worms and such, and when you can, you can't even use it because you can't buy the correct pole for lures, the game becomes infuriating. Wait to download this game until they actually fix the mechanics and make the game more open. After all, why should I wait until I'm like level 50 to be able to buy a particular fishing pole? Are they saying that in the real world, I can't buy a really nice setup unless I've been fishing for a long time already? No...a salesman will sell you whatever you want, even if you don't know how to use it.			"

								EARLY ACCESS REVIEWPros:Looks nice, graphics are fairly goodHas a more realistic look than most fishing gamesCons:First and foremost the game has a misplaced focus on locating fish rather than the catching of them.It can takes hours finding the right spot, time of day, right bait to find what your looking for and when you finally hook one, you can reel it in quickly without much trouble at all. The ""fish fight"" aspect of the game  is virtually nonexistent.The game claims to be ""multiplayer"" however is simply a single player instance with a chat box in the corner.No customization at all, any gear other than what rod and reel your using doesn't change your appearance at all, in fact you never see more than your own two hands.In its current state the game seems like little more than a tech demo, the maps are small, and it get repetitive rather quickly.VERDICT:I can't recommend the game at this time.The developers I think are dropping the ball, or what has been the case for many EA titles, the game is just a cash grab. They seem to prioritize how players earn experience over the fixing of major bugs in the game. In the first week of release they adjusted fish spawns and exp rate three times and have again since then. Balance in a game like this is important, however all these changes have been ""nerfs"" to experience gains to slow player progression. In a normal EA title this would be fine, however this one sells a premium membership in the cash shop that gives 50% bonus to experience. Early Access or not, if your going to have a cash shop people expect to get what they pay for and not have the game changed in a way that devalues what they purchased. Quite frankly the actions of the developers thus far throws up the   ""cash grab"" flags in my opinion.			"

								Since the new update has caused mostly moments of frustation, I'm changing my review.. Before the update, you could use the best gear you could afford and while it may have taken awhile to reel in a fish, atleast your line didn't go all slinky and a 4lb fish take 400+ ft of line. The game was good the way it was, but I do appreciate the devs trying to change things. For me personally 500+ hours logged a change this big kinda stresses me out. Maybe it won't be the same for you..so I won't say it isn't worth giving it a try, so I will atleast still recommend you try it... After all it's free. P.S> Devs I appreciate the time you put into ""change"" but I hope you plan to supply us with decent float rods in the shop. We've been asking for this for a long time now. How can we pull in 20+ lb catfish and others on bait rods when we only have the best float rod- a gold item the Fenix that cost 40 gold.. that can't handle anything over 17 lbs?? ...maybe to try to convince us to buy DLC? Hope you don't become P2P...I happily bough DLC when it was optional. Honestly......new rods and sufficient gear to match this change in the update would have solved this whole issue. All 20 levels I have been waiting for a better float rod. Still yet to be seen but I know ya'll are working hard and I do appreciate that.			"

Such as getting banned for telling the Moderator that there is alot of bugs that they could improve on and maybe helping to really make the game better but no they get banned because its foul langauge. Another bad aspect to this game is the forums. Yet again getting banned becasue you can not have freedom of speech  and i'm sure saying you'r baby sitting the game forums is kind of insaulting towords us players but hay if you want to be that kind of person . Do what you want but heres a question. If this game has so many bugs and problems why dont you just take the litle kids advist and not bannding them for trying to get a point towords acullay fixing this problems .

								I enjoyed the game previously. But now, it becomes a pay to play game. Utterly frustrated after few hours. Travelling cost too much, yet the reward per fish arent that rewarding. I found myself grinding money at Lone Star Lake most of the time, and just waste it all buying licenses and expensive travelling cost. Not worth the time for free player like me...Gonna grab my real fishing pole in head to the nearest fisheries instead..			"

								I used to love this game and would come back to it from time to time just for a relaxing free fishing experience. I particularly love the fact that the developers used to be adamant that it would stay free with only real money purchase being the premium membership. Everything in game had to be earned and the best stuff had to be earned by catching the best fish. Now since the last update you can only get the best gear by paying real money and the prices of everything has skyrocketed to ridiculous amounts. Probably won't be returning to the game until changes are made to make the game great again.Pre 0.7.0 this game was a 10/10 completely free fishing experience.Post 0.7.0 its a 3/10 freemium experience at best.

								I have to agree with what people are saying this game was great until 2017.Normaly a game is considered pay to win if you can not play it without paying money, the problem with this game since the update is it is beyond that.Even when spending Money (no matter how much) there is no progression possible, the ingame playmoney system is broken beyond everything. You would have to fish the same lake for at least 3 ingame days to get any type of profit which can without any problem be 12H real life time, this is absurd.So the only question i have to ask is: How do you call a game that is not even pay to win since you cant win no matter how much money you spent ???

								This game is the best fishing game on the market. I have an old pc, but it used to be a strong one, even though it's performance got worse this game can run with beautiful graphics with a stable fps. The gameplay is awesome if you like these kind of games. And this game is free-to-win so it s a really big 5 star rating on my part.Pros:+ Free to play, really you dont have to pay a dime to enjoy it+ Awesome graphics+ You dont need an overpriced PC t run this+ Really relaxingCons:Uhmm... none?

								Im really gonna miss this game. Guess I will just have to go too Fishing World. Im level 32 with over 340 hours invested. I supported this game I bought premium, I own all but 2 of the DLC content they have up for sell. You noticed I used the word supported cause I will never spend another dime on this game with the way things are now. I really feel like I just got crapped on. They removed items from the game that I paid money for. This so called upgrade to the Heavy Casting pack, Its not a upgrade its a peasment cause they took the 660lb Fish Net out of the game so you couldn't carry as much fish and would have too end your day sooner.  Thats fine but dont screw with something that I paid my money for.  If it came with the DLC leave it and figure something else out. The amount of money it takes to travel too and making it back while there has become way more difficult but not impossible if your willing to spend the money. But the licenses that you have to buy to fish there is completely insane. Adanced Unlimited License for Alaska is 1000 baitcoins. In the Premium shop 1090 bait coins will cost you 49.99.  All I can say is WOW WTF!  WIth the introduction of the 3D avatar's, that causes even more problems. For example in Flordia there are 3 small T docks to fish from and when you have 5 or more people standing there it's hard to see. All you see are fishing poles and fish flying in front of you.  These are just afew issues the game has now, there are many many more. With just these examples you should be able to see where this game is headed. But it will not cost you to download for yourself and give it a shot. Only thing I can think of is maybe they were bought out by EA.  If thats the case Origin's Vault is needing more games.			"

								Attention ! Freemium on sight!Game used to be lots of fun until patch 0.7.0 this month when they screwed everything: game mechanics, paid DLC items nerfed or missing (i've spent real money on them DLC, i wouldn't encourage anyone to do it now tho, it's not worth it), game  is lagging all the time bcs of the 3d avatars they introduced you cant be with your friends in your room anymore unless u pay cash money ,economy inflation is impossible to bear with, fast forward time was introduced a cooldown to make us pay even more money, basically its a money grabber not worth spending your time and cash on it until they take seriously all negative reviews the update made many of us publish and fix it...

								This game is great in general: graphics and gameplay are well done. But i can't recommend this game to anyone because of his xp system. It's a grind fest, where you must play a whole day getting the same fish if you want to level up and get access other areas. It's not fun, it's boring as hell.EDIT: after some comments:I did not mean that i will get the same fish when i cast with specific bait/lure and on the specific spot. I mean you have to ""grind"" on the place that give a better, let's say xp/hour, in order to level up your account to get acess to new places/fishes. Trout are a example, i have some friends that spend the whole day getting trouts to gain a single level. And there are fishes that just dont ""worth"" the time because this exp system. I like to get all the fishes, but some species just dont worth the time you spend there.Another thing is that when i get a fish, i don't feel ""rewarded"". Fishes don't really fight, it's easy to get a trophy fish without even care taht your line may break. And since you learned, by yourself or saw any tutorial, how to get a specific fish, the AI of the game will always work on the same way. So if you cast on the same spot with the same lure in the same time (i heard that some uniques are caught exactly at the same minute of the day), you will get the fish. There is no ""random"" things that always happens on fishing irl. Some times you will get a fish on the ""wrong"" place and time and this don't happens here.Anyways, i read the last news and looks like they will improve exactly what makes me dislike the gamWhen this happens for sure i will change my review to positive, because the game overall is good.

								So I log into FP for the first time in a few months and see that I can travel to Canada again for the holiday. I also see there is changes with the way the game has money. I have 32k.... cool, I spend 4k on a license and 11k to get there. Well - when I try to pull out a pole - none. So I go to inventory and find nothing. I'm now assuming everything is gone.Not happy. I try to buy a new reel at 12k and a pole...not enough money.At this point, I'm really frustrated and irritated enough to quit and uninstall the game after a being around since it got on Steam. I bite the bullet and go home... only to find all my stuff there. Now I wasted all that cash.I'm writing because I'm at the point where I finally frustrated and hope you guys can fix it - maybe return the in game money I started with.....if not, it's been fun and well, I'd rather spend $20 for the game and not have a F2Pay kind of set up and may look at the Euro fishing game. I wrote to them on Facebook and the answer I got was lame:""Hello, every time you go fishing you have to make sure you have everything you need - from gear to lures etc, that works in real life, too.  We also stated in update notes that all gear has been moved to home.  Therefore we cannot do refunds, because nothing happened due to bugs. You can however go to a free lake and get yourself up & running there.""I don't want to spend 5 to 15 minutes reading game notes of drastic changes. NEVER before did our inventory stay at home. We log in and our items were on our body and in our bags. Bad excuse. So - I'm uninstalling and will be looking at Euro Fishing or hell, I'll get a pole out in Minecraft and have a better time. What a shame. It's beatiful, relaxing and all that I like. This last patch for Freemium just blew it. Not going to dump money into another game like Planetside 2. I will pay the chunk ($10-50) up front and call it good from here on. Milking people for cash is lame anymore. Good bye Fishing Planet.			"

Because progress in this game is incredibly frustrating and impossible if you don't invest tens of hours catching the same fish over and over again.I just finished a 5 hour fishing marathon. 150 fish caught, for the next level I'll need approximately 90 more. To reach the next area and be able to fish some different species I'll need 2 more levels. frustrating to say the least.I'll definitely change my review into a positive one as soon as this grind of hell is over.

								Best-looking, realistic fishing game I have ever played. Fantastic graphics, fishing options, locations -- it looks like the developers have done their work building the game. This was a title I could potentially have seen myself playing and contributing to for a long time. Potentially... A *potentially* great game, but, like many online competitive titles there is a huge problem with rampant cheaters and hackers. Unfortunately, this ruins the experience for players who don't cheat, and also raises the red flag. Cannot recommend.			"

								Great fishing game. It's not a perfect simulator, but what is, aside from pressing a button and a train moving on tracks? The devs are extremely friendly and active, working to make an interesting game. Fishing requires some level of thought, and can be an exciting experience for some species, and a relaxing for others. Some new patches and content comes buggy, but the Devs HAUL to fix such problems, (including mechanics that the majority hates ,etc). It's beautiful and alot of fun without spending a cent, so try it!			"

								So yea... once you learn the mechanics and the all around gameplay, it's kinda relaxing. However, I have to ask is it now a precedent to have an early access title thats free to play and also have Paid DLC? The game could use work, so what am I getting at? Idk, just seems like a simular tactic that other F2P titles have pulled as well (Ark).			"

								The developers have taken something wonderful and absolutely destroyed it. I havent even gotten into actually playing the updated game yet. I opened it, looked at the menu, saw how I can no longer fish where I have already earned, and for me to do so I'm supposed to pay $70 for just 30 days access? To that one lake? Are you stoned????

								- Game looks beautiful! An amazing feature for any free-to-play game anymore.  - Item mall (real life money items/features) are more for convience.  All of the content in the game (different areas you fish) are capable of being unlocked by leveling and using in-game currency for players who choose not to spend money on the game.  An ideal way of doing the Item Mall.  Only thing I can see people having issues with it is when tournaments are unlocked and players who spend can get a certain lure a level early, but that's far from pay to win in my eyes.- For the most part the community are more mature players.  But with any free-to-play game, you are going to see some immature idiots trying to ruin your experience.Overall this game is pretty addicting, fun and requires patiences (it is fishing after all.)

								One of my favorite games of all time... I've been playing since launch, through many different versions of the game and always liked it and adapted to the changes... the gameplay is still fantastic IMO and offers an experience unique from any game on the market. Regarless of that, I  cannot recommend the game in it's current state and they have basically turned it into a pay to play game loaded with in game purchases that they force on you fairly hard. I wouldn't even mind buying the game as part of early access but I won't be purchasing premium or paying for dlc or money (all of which I've done to support the devs :/ ) while the game lies in its current state.

								This game sadly turned into a cashgrab. Aside from the ultimate showstoppers: cooldowns and timers, there's just everything tweaked towards making you pay unless (unconfirmed) you set a VERY considerable amount of time aside. I haven't seen that though. So it might just be impossible for a working and living human.The game doesn't resolve around fishing. It's more or less an economy simulator set in the fishing scenerio. They have ""travel costs"", daily access fees, daily fishing licenses, gear upgrade costs, lure costs, bait costs... Everything costs, a lot.All that just to make you grind mindlessly by the way. Yes, there are other locations available, suitable to your ""level"" though.It kills the spirit of fishing. Fishing can be fun anywhere, not just in your ""level zone"".It also teaches you nothing. At all. It's just a gear show and a grind fest. What a missed oportunity.Instead of all the timer mess they could've just named a price (e.g. between 50-100€/$) where you can buy everything and be done with the cashgrab. But they didn'tAlso it seems they There would've been so much potential, for example VR. But sadly it seems the game is made for money, not because the devs actually like the sport.			"

								I use to enjoy this game, use to play it a lot, use to love it. Recently, i've hated the game every second i've played it. They're pushing pay to play. I suggest not spending a dime and letting the game fail so they learn as a newbie dev team that they can't do that. Updates are another thing, they give you a date and or time and they fail to reach their end. The game is horrible now. The devs ruined this for lots of players. I seriously hope this game fails, and everyone leaves it so that they have a ""fully developed"" game with no one playing it because of how stupid it is now.			"

								Right now this game has 13 DLC packs, totaling approx. $285, but this game is free-to-play apparently.I can buy 4 triple A titles at release (and have change) with the total cost of the DLC, and this game absolutely does not equate to 4 titles.Prices have been inflated (they haven't scaled; everything is actually more expensive) and perm. licenses now require currency that as of right now can only be bought, or scrounged up over dozens of competitions. (assuming you place) Some licenses alone cost $50. (Alaska)The new, insidious, and exploitative economy is designed to push players to just buy DLC and premium currency instead of playing the actual game. I would argue that the game, as of 0.70 is as - or even more difficult, than it was when it first released. In the 2 years this game has been out, The dev's promise to deliver a quality free-to-play experience has manifested into a trap to sate their greed. Fishing Planet is taking advantage of its monopoly on the fishing simulator niche here on Steam, and it's disgusting. It is a former shell of the principles by which it was founded, and I find the avarice of the developers appalling.   The developers do not derserve to be rewarded with your money or your time for their deceptive practices. Stay away.			"

								A great game, with a great community, however a horrible moderator who doesn't believe in or allow freedom of expression within Forums.The Good: Good graphics with varied fishing locations and species of fish. There are plenty of fish to be caught and plenty of locations to catch them, the developers have done a good job of try to emmerse you in the game play.Great community, every time that I have had a problem or not understood things the other players have taken their time to help give advice, point me in the right direction, and in general to be pleasant and helpful.Game play, at first things can be a little confusing and even a little over whelming in the choices or rod, reels, baits, lures hooks, etc..,, however with a little effort and a few questions asked a person can have a well balancd set up and be catching trophy fish and unique fish.The Bad.No freedom of speech within the forums. Even if your post violates none of the Steam Rules or the rules of Fishing Planets forums the modrator refuses to allow open and honrst debate regarding the game or any problems encountered while playing the game. If it varies from his opinion you will be banned.Sounds, the sounds seemed canned and antiquated. The dove sounds like a whistle kids make by blowing into their hands.Not enough communication from developers. Not much more can be said on this topic. without communications the user feels left out and abandoned. Synopsis. A very good game that is fun to play and a great break from blowing stuff up all the time. After a long days work the game is a great way to relax and enjoy fishing at home. Whether you buy content or use what you are awarded as you level up, the game is a blast. The best gaming community I have seen in a very long time. Definitely worth the time to check out.			"

								I would not recommend this game for anyone except maybe the people who like mini games. The graphics were okay, water had some problems and its a fishing game so it's important. Real water doesn't just move up in one spot about ten feet while its a still lake and there wasn't any point where you could actually see the fish in the water even if the water was crystal clear, which is my favorite part about fishing is seeing the fish in the water. Before I even downloaded the game, I read and met all of the minimum requirements, and even all but one of the recommended requirements and when I log in the game says I dont even meet minimum requirements. My computer isn't a bad laptop or anything I bought it specifically with high graphics games in mind and put quite a chunk of money into it and before I even start playing this game tells me You dont have the minimum requirements and the game is going to glitch out on you. Get into game and all of the controls are screwed up the tutorial spent ten minutes telling me to press one button while the actual button that I had to go hunt and peck looking for was across the keyboard. After that shenannigans I get past the tutorial and get into a private room and I cant move because the game keeps telling me I dont meet the minimum requirements. After a week of constant failures on this game I just gave up even trying. Ive had better fishing experiences in my pool to be honest and would rather play any of the major console fishing games before I deal with this. I understand that its early access but usually you include the tag Alpha Test or something on your steam page so that people know its going to be terrible to play and you're honestly going to spend about an hour working through glitches.

But it's easy to rank up and start earning more money to afford better equipment and then the game becomes really fun. For being a free game I was really impressed with the quality of the graphics and the gameplay, there are some bugs but this is a early access game so that's not a suprise.

								F2p done right here. Even right now in early point of the Early Access, without much to do, other than grind experience and chat with other players at your fishing spot, this game truly shines brighter than the other fishing sims and games I have played so far.So many rods and lures to choose from, with different kinds of lines and reels , its really the fishing game to try out.Even at this point there are good amount of spots and a lots of different fish types to choose from.I personally love the leveling system, and the unlocking of better equipment and clothes through ranking up while fishing. Cant wait for the tournaments, quests and duels which are coming on a later date into the game. They will make the relaxing fish grinding even an better experience for us in the future.And about the microtransactions.This game definitely isn't another TheHunter, if you know what I mean. You can easily play and enjoy this game for full of its content for free and enjoy it as much as anyone. The ingame currency is easy to obtain and gets you the gear and licenses you need for the fishing spots without too much work (Or work at all, cause its fun to earn ingame currency while fishing and turning the fish in). If you are interested in fishing or just fishing games, I cannot recommend this game highly enough for you. "

								This game is amazing!!!Def the best fishing game I've ever played actual fishing part wise. Why the negative score?They changed it so you can no longer have a home state. This means you have to pay for travel EVERYWHERE now. The first one past the begining lake is $1800. It takes me about an hour to get that $ when I am f2p. Then the best is that if I make a mistake and have to go back, that $ is not refunded at all. Lower travel costs or bring back a home state option and I'll change the review, for now I guess I'm just stuck of the Lone Star Lake.  "

								A quality F2P model and amazing, in-depth (no pun intended) game.It still feels like i'm playing somthing I bought for the price of a small AAA title.It has a suprising amount of attention to detail in this game, very immersive, relaxing and even very exciting at times.Has a very well polished economy and progression system, my only complaint us when you're starting off and bankrupt yourself by accident by over-shopping. The only way to get enough money back to go on another fishing trip is to wait a day or two for daily login rewards.Overall very addictive and satisfying game.Ps. would pay for preimuim or DLC to by a gun and shoot that mongrel Mourning Dove and Woodpecker			"

								Great game. Caters to the outdoorsman, as well as the MMO player. Which I happen to be both. Has many aspects of great mmorpgs, level progression, gear upgrading. As you level up you unlock access to new livewells, rods, reels, lines, lure, bait, and fishing equipment. The leveling is at a good pace, and the money system is NOT pay to win. You get cash for every single fish you catch, you also get experience. While I've never put 1$ into the game, I consider myself pretty decent at it. It's all about finding the right spots to fish, and using the right gear, as well as different techniques to control your lure. The fights are exciting and nailbiting at times. When you just know you have that trophy fish on the line,and you don't want him to unhook. Also, there is unique fish, and Trophy grade fish, which will give you very huge rewards, unique fish also give you money for the cash shop, which you also recieve a chunk every time you level up,and the reards increase every level. If your not sure about it, JUST TRY IT, us gamers need to support these developers who think outside the box and make great games. This is true progress in gaming, not another copy and paste sword and board, or korean grinder. This is where its at, you must try! Look me up when the friends list goes live and let's nail them!

								As of today this game became grindfest fishing 2015. At higher levels you are now expected to catch over 1200+ fish to get 1 level. There is no way in game to farm gold any more for buying better gear. Highly recommended to stay away from this game until more content for XP and Gold is added in.			"

								Let me star this off by saying I am one of those that is VERY lery of F2P games. Its not that I have an issue with the sales model.....If done properly it works very well for some games. But thats where it all falls apart, because 9 times outta 10 it is NOT done properly. To many games say F2P but then hide huge amounts of content behind paywalls. To many say F2P but are actually P2W.......And EVERYONE here Im sure know full well what I speak of....I could name games but would rather not....That having been said......This is a great game, and a GREAT F2P model. Even the DLC on steam is mostly stuff that you can get ingame playing without ever paying a cent (or there is comparable from what I saw).I have not purchased any of the DLC yet but I plan to, seems a great way to stock up on role specific gear AND this honestly has potential to be best fishing sim ever..Im willing to throw some $$ at that!!!I have purchased the 3 day premium account. Can say these packs or more than reasonably priced for what you get..and brilliant you can use your steam wallet for this!! I did level to almost 4 before getting premium to get a feel for the game. Yes it is a bit slow...but its fishing, everything is a little slow ya =) It did not seem to slow or unfair or overly grindy at all.Great game thats 100% playable with ZERO investment, but well worth every penny if you do decide to spend a bit.

								I really enjoyed this game, bought most the DLC and spent money in game as well. Not because I felt I had to but because I enjoyed the game and wanted to support it. After the most recent updates you feel more like you have to spend money. These cool downs on fastforwarding time when your net is full is a game ruiner. I feel as though the game has lost its direction. I know a business needs to make money but I cannot see profits rising this way. People like myself will leave because although it was a good game theyve ruined it. Sad really. I dont mind spening money on games when I feel like I have the choice, when I feel like there is no choice you can count me out.			"

								Good game, very addictive. It does have a few glitches, but I've only run into funny ones (fish you caught spinning like a helicopter, fish going into the forest and rocketing out above you). I can't wait for what this game will add, because it's in early access, so it'll be exciting. Also, for real life fisherman, this is probably the best you will get. It's pretty detailed. Graphics are nice, fps is smooth, overall fun.  (Only request is- going to new lakes is a bit expensive and hard to get your money's worth, so I'm stuck at missouri. Oh well)			"

								I really really really liked this game, and would have rated it positive up until the latest upgrade which did improve a lot of things, but the new absolutely positively horrendous abysmal fishing gear damage model is just sooooooooo unrealistic that I'm quiting the game until I read or get an email that it has been improved.  I just can't comprehend how the developers, which were doing a really got job up until now IMHO, could have gotten that part so completely wrong without some kind of maliscioius intent on their part.  I was helping the effort by buying a couple of DLC packs at $50, which is close to what one would pay for a new popular title game, but this current damage model just blew the game out of the water and off my play list for me.I suggest anybody who is interested in starting this game now wait until you see news indicating the developers have instituted a MUCH more improved damage model.It simply sucks right now!

								Absolutely the best fishing game ever!And it really is 100% free, if you don't mind some grind you can earn all the in game cash you need to buy equipment, on the other hand if you are the impatient sort and you want to help support the devs you can buy a DLC or some in game cash to move things along but that is totally up to the player and not needed to enjoy the game.The grahics are beautiful and the fishing simulaton itself is about as close as you'll get without actually leaving the house.The game is really quite relaxing with the sounds of leaves rustling in the breeze, birds ect.And the really nice part is that for an early access game it has a lot of content, I have not been playing long but the game seems to get updated on a regular basis s it will only get better.Really one of the best casual games on Steam, nothing to lose by downloading it.

								The tournaments were designed so that lower-level players are doomed to fail because they pit you against high-level players that have better gear, and most imporantly a bigger fishnet. That's not an easy probem to get around, other than DON'T PLAY RIP-OFF TOURNAMENTS!They must have put the monkeys in control of development because human intuition and inginuity are nearly non-existant, at this point.I would have written a better review and given Thumps Up about a month or so ago, but now they've decided to set it up for failure, it seems.

								You can buy actual fishing licenses cheaper than you can in-game....What are these devs thinking? All the way up to $99 for a years worth of VIRTUAL fishing... You can fish in 2 spots on 1 lake for free at first. EDIT: Apparently with the exp you earn you can eventually gain the in-game currency and buy the licenses to fish elsewhere. But the exp was updated and nerfed so low that this is an absolute GRINDFEST. And that lake gets old and boring very fast, as well as the .5 lb Bluegill. Also the menus are a mess. If you have the virtual money to buy something it can still be blacked out with no explanation as to why...Multiplayer is NOT implemented at this time. The devs lie and ban on forums without warning... This one is a line breaker. Game 6/10 Execution 1/10			"

								I've played this game quite a bit and I honestly enjoy it. If you're looking at this game then you can probably guess its a bit grind and time consuming because its FISHING. So the grinding is honestly enjoyable. Theres the thrill of catching trophy or unique fish which keeps me going. This also makes you lvl up quickly. If you do decide to go premium, you get a 50% exp boost  which is not a game changer so this game is definitely NOT pay to win. Also I'm not sure why but the loading screen is a little long when you're opening the game but not like 1 min long so be a little patient.			"

								I love this game.  The fact that it's still early Access is very exciting to me because as good as it is now it will only get better.  For those of you scared off by the thought of spending money on a free to play game rest easy.  If you never spend any real money your gamming experience will not suffer.  As of right now the only thing you can purchase is more in game money which is easily earned by catching fish in game.  If you like you can buy a membership that comes with a small xp boost but that really just speeds up the game.  If your not in a hurry to level up or buy gear you can play for free and have the same experience as those that choose to pay.			"

								Pros:- The graphics for the tackle and other items are well done. When you buy items from the bait shop or pro shop it looks like you're actually purchasing a real item.- The environment graphics aren't perfect but they are nice.- The imposed limit of what you can buy when on a fishing trip is interesting. You are limited to buying small things like extra bait or line but if you need a better rod you have to cancel the trip. It makes planning crucial.Cons:- There are certain combinations of items to catch certain fish, and certain spots to catch them. There is very little variety other than the size, length, or quality (trophy or non-trophy) of the fish once you figure this out.- Bugs and unrealistic physics. Sometimes when you cast you will just drop the line into the water at your feet. I was told by many other players that they experienced this bug. If you yank a fish out of the water sometimes it will send it into this ridiculous orbital spin where it goes sailing around your body. I ended up not having to struggle with fish anymore because I would yank them from the depths of the river and they would go flying into the sky and right up on the riverbank where I could just reel them in as they sat there.- Two forms of currency. A lot of items in the game can only be bought with gold. You can earn it without any form of micro-transaction but it just doesn't make sense. When did you ever go into a Bass Pro shop and try to buy something with gold coins? These aren't always things like special rods or reels...they are consumables like grasshoppers...- No weather effects.- Poor day and ""night"" cycle.- There really is no multiplayer in this game. You fish by yourself and you can chat with other players but you never see them in-game.-  Extremely limited by fishing locations. You can only travel the space of about 20 feet along a bank or dock to change where you fish. You won't be finding any secret fishing holes. Part of the fun of fishing is exploring and finding your own spot.			"

								This makes me happy. Way more happy than most games I currently own. Sure its not for everyone, but few things are. It helps to know a lot about fishing and tackle going into the game, as the tutorial teaches you almost nothing. You will want to have a decent PC to fully enjoy this game's beauty. I would love to see better textures/clarity on the actual fish you catch but thats minor, as you only see the fish for a few seconds while deciding to keep or release.  Its slow going to get to level 3 where more gear becomes available. Wish I could turn the birds chirping down or off or maybe they could just make them chirpy at dusk and dawn. No bug spray required. Can still drink beer to your hearts content in your own home while fishin for some bass.9/10 as a Fishing simulator......Cant really compare this game fairly to any AAA titles out. Or even to most games. Its in a class of its own.			"

								Fishing Planet was a good romp for a while. The grind set in pretty hard after Colorado however. Even with recent XP bumps, there didn't seem to be any reason to visit the next area. North Carolina had more spots for snags, less XP, and generally less progression than Colorado. So you're faced with the prospect of grinding out three+ levels of trout instead of feeling like you're getting somewhere by moving on to the next area. I skipped the (somewhat miserable) New York area entirely after a couple of trial runs there.But if you can ignore the grins and stick to the starter area and Colorado, you'll see what a beautiful, relaxing game it is. You can certainly kill some time and drink a few beers, maybe even kindle your interest in real life fishing. But unless there is vast improvement in the progression, don't let it become a major time sink. Just enjoy the good stuff, and hope the bad areas get better.			"

								If you like the old school fishing games you'll be in for a treat with this game. Keep in mind as of this review it is still a beta. So far, I have made it up to level 4 and it has taken a bit of time, but being a fisherman myself in real life the leveling hasn't felt unrealistic.  Going out and not catching a fish for a period time can and does happen and while I can't sit down and play this game for a very long period of time I do find it enjoyable and even relaxing to a certain extent.The game overall I can recommend, but if you come into it expecting a super-exciting fast-paced game this is not for you. If do however enjoy fishing and want a simulator that is fairly close to the experience give this a try I don't think you'll be disappointed.   "

								Game started off good. But now isnt that great... Was one of those games that the devs got too money hungry and ruined it in the long run. Yes it may be early access but trust me when i say the devs changed. I use to enjoy this game but recently i played it again and it deleted all the stuff i owned. Good thing i only wasted about 12 hours. rather than days or weeks			"

								At this time, I feel that this is a freemium game that requires paying to enjoy, and the price seems quite high to be honest.  I normally like to support devs that are working hard on making an awesome game; however, for a reasonable price.  It is not for casual players, unless you don't mind fishing at a single lake that my circle has begun calling noob lake.  Everyone in the game is now from Texas, and that is the only lake you can reasonably fish until you are at least level 16 when you can get decent sized nets.I have calculated the cost of going to the next level location, which is Missouri, and it takes a minimum of ~20 lbs of the most profitible fish in the area, large mouth bass to break even, but only if you spend baitcoin (the in-game premium currency) to get an advanced license permanently.  The good thing is you can earn some baitcoin through achievements, leveling, and by logging in every day for a bonus (every 5 gives 1 baitcoin).  So getting these licenses is not impossible, just takes a loooong time if you want to stay free.If you have plenty of time to grind fishing noob lake, then go for it.  If you really like fishing, get bored easily in the same spot, but don't have a lot of time to play (like me), then stay away.  If you are a hard-core fishing nut and don't mind paying quite a bit of real-world money to do whatever you want to do, then this game is for you.			"

								If you want a fishing game this is the only one you need. People complaining about grinding? It's fishing, it's fun and it takes patience and getting to know what the fish like. You'll be able to start catching fish right away without that, but if you really want to be able to catch the a trophy or catch a unique fish then you'll need to do your homework.The community is very friendly and willing to help you out regardless of your knowledge of the game and it's the first online community that has been able to elicited a smile during the hours of playing over the last few days. If you don't have a little patience or a little drive to try and figure the fish out then the game isn't for you. All the information is pretty easily available and there are plenty of guides on the steam forum and within the game itself if you ever get stuck. The gear choice is a little overwhelming at first, but you pick it up quickly.			"

								So far a very promising game. There is a lot of potential here and the devs claim to have realism at the fore-front of their minds. Realistic game that will get you addicted quickly. Once these future updates come out this will be a game for veterans and players new to fishing alike.  It should be noted that there is a lot that needs to be tweaked, fixed, changed, added to and so on. This game is still Early Access and is only a small representation of what they are planning on doing with the game as updates start to roll out. Please be patient and check back often for updates.  It's too early to start listing pros and cons due to the amount of changes that will be taking place. Everyone has their own opinions, instead of reading what others think check it out for yourself. In this case you more than likely won't regret it. So far overall great game. High attention to detail and realism. Will only get more so by a large amount in time. Enjoy. :D			"

								Alright im gonna make this review quite short at the moment because i haven't really got that far into the game when i write this. First and formost i gotta say.. Wow.. This game.. If you fish in real life and love it this game will pull you in and keep you playing! This is one of the most realistic and fun fishing games ive played in a LOOOOONG time. You actually gotta use real tactics, use the right lure/bait, right rod, line and depth. This is not some arcade game where you just throw out a lure or a bobber with some bait and just catch fish.. But that's the best part in my opinion :)Many of you that has seen theHunter for example on steam might think ""oh is this one of those games where you have to pay real money for licenses (Yes there are licenses in this game but ALL of em can be bought with ingame cash even unlimited ones so you don't have to keep paying every time you wanna fish. And keep in mind if you buy a license for  example 1 day it will actually last for 24 in real life hours)For now this is a wellcrafted, fun and very realistic fishing game with ALOT of potential to be one of the best ones out there. With more updates coming (boats, saltwater fishing more lures, baits and fish) this game will keep me busy for a very long time :) And don't let the bluegill ""farming"" let you down in the begining :P It really opens up after level 3. Bass fishing is extremly fun! :D I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves fishing :) A big thanks to the devs for their hard work trying to keep the servers stable and pushing updates at the same time :)			"

I don't have a problem with spending on a game, but not when it has this many flaws.  Bugs are a very serious and legit problem issue with game play.  Expect to have to close and reload this game multiple times while playing.With all the bad, the game has serious potential.  I have been waiting for a legit fishing game for a long, long time.  This almost gets it.  Probably the best I've seen for incorporating action in the bait.  Most fishing sims before just were a straight retrieve more or less.  Others were also too arcade like.  I think that is what disappoints most.  They have all the elements, just failed to put the pieces together right.			"

If I want that I will go to my local lake and spend the day there, not on a computor.Now heres the best part, ALL the egomaniacs that got to full level before the patch, Now what the Deves to make the game haeder to play. thats right it it harder to catch fish, make currency, get leveled. see thier already on top, and don't want anyone else there. Would I recommend this game, maybe. if you have money burnng a hole on your pocket or have hours or days to just sit and waist, sure play it.

								There should not be any negative reviews on this game. If you like fishing and you like video games. this is perfect. The best part is it's F2P done right. I've had it for a week, no premium account, and I'm level 15. I earned every bit of gear I have. Have advanced unlimited license to everything I unlocked so far. This game is great. I will occasionally buy in game credits down the road just to show support to the devs for such a great game and a perfect F2P model			"

								As I reeled in what felt like my millionth .4 pound bluegill last night, I realized ""wow, if I were fishing for bluegill in real life with worms right now, I'd sure to be catching more than just them!"" This game has great mechanics as far as the catching of fish, casting lines, watching for a strike, etc..  But the grind as it stands now is just horrible.  In reality, no arbitrary level of experience blocks me from catching different species.  I really wish the game would throw a few line-breaking bass, pike, and catfish into the mix while you're still in the newbie phase of catching freight train loads full of bluegill.  I also wish it would let you advance beyond bluegill/crappies more quickly, as I'm bored with these two species of fish.  The sizes of fish really don't vary all that much, either.  I'd like to see some 10/12oz bluegill, some trophy pounders, and some itsy-bitsy ones that you have no idea how they took the bait in the first place.Other than that, I am definitely excited for the future.  This is an early access game, and a free-to-play one at that.			"

Early Access Review
								Every day has been getting harder. Losing the will to go on without my sweet Mary is taking away my ability to perform daily tasks. It's only been 3 days since she passed, but it feels like years. Fishing Planet took everything. It started during the Steam summer sale. ""Honey, I added $50 to the Steam Account! What games would you like me to buy?"" As if possesed by the will of Satan, my head turned 360 degrees as I said ""Fishing Planet."" I didn't even know what Fishing Planet was! I've never heard of it before I said it out of impulse in that moment. She told me that the game was free and that we didn't even have to add money to the account. I punched her for talking back to me. We passionately made love as the game downloaded, for we were eager to embark on this gaming experience. 1.2... 1.3... The gigabytes ticked away like a grandfather clock, and when the hour striked, it was finished. We both rushed to our computers to get ready to catch some sweet sweet seafood. The tutorial took a real toll on me; while Mary had no problem passing it, I could not catch a single fish. I'm normally a pretty tame guy, but this drove me to nearly punching a hole in my wall. My wife came over and passed it for me to calm my nerves. I hear a frantic chant from across the room, ""Honey, look! We can fish in Missouri!"". We lived in Missouri, so that was a pretty cool thing to hear. We traveled to our next destination, but as I spawned into the river, the flashbacks began to haunt me. July 14th, 1973. Me and my father were fishing in the same river as was depicted in the game. My dad said, ""Son, there is nothing more valuable in life than patience."", as he could tell I was getting fed up due to my lack of catching anything. ""I know dad, it's just a little stressful."", I respond. After a few hours of sitting near the river I start to scream because I haven't caught a single thing all day, while my dad was reaping in bass! This is when I learned that paitience was more than a virtue. My dad wasn't just trying to teach me a lesson, he was protecting the lives of the human race. ""This is why you needed to be patient!"", screamed my dad as a storm started brewing in the air. Suddenly, the river drained and the daunting hand of Satan tore the riverbed in half, taking my father down with him. It was a tragedy that I will never forgive myself for. As the flashback ended, I realized 6 hours had passed and I had caught nothing. However, my wife was realing in bass like there was no tomorrow! I knew better than to get angry, but something came over me as I started screaming satanic chants into the air. The sky turned black as a meteor struck our house. I was in the living room, but Mary wasn't so fortunate. She was struck directly by the meteor. I couldn't believe I had let this happen again. I lost my father, my wife, and my house. All to Fishing Planet.			"

								Still in it's infantcy but extremely fun! Don't think it's a point, click, wait for fish, click again, done, you caught a fish. There is real stratagy involved. I was pulling in 0.4 lbs bluegill one after the other until I was blue in the gills. Then a fellow fisherman just down the shore privied me to some tips on how to catch different fish and the very next catch I made was a Young Trophy Bass. Just like real life, you have to out smart the fish, have gobs of patients and simply enjoy fishing. If you can meet that criteria then Fishing Planet is the next best thing to literally going fishing.			"

								This is a pretty fun fishing game.  Can be a bit grindy, but it's enjoyable and relaxing.  If you're looking for a chill experience in a game of skill, this one is for you.Graphically it's pretty decent.  I don't have any issues with it on my machine, and find it faily bug free for the time being.  You get the odd lag spike every now and again, but other than that I haven't noticed anything game-breaking.A few things I'd like to see:Additional Weather Effects.  Rain would be a nice addition.  Wind would also be a good simulation addition to add to the challenge of placing your cast.Better social aspects.  Friends lists would be cool.  A guild system (fishing clubs?).  A slighty improved interface for going over your equipment.  It'd be nice to easily compare items to one another on mouse-over...like a hover box when you look at something in your inventory to compare to what you have currently equipped.  That's my two cents for now.  Back to the water for me.			"

								Pros:  Most realistic fishing game to date.  Think ""The Hunter"" but with a higher moisture content.Very active Devs that listen to the community and actually seem passionate about fishing.Wide range of fish from bluegills to bass to pike and everything between.  Muskies in the future.Simple but effective casting/retrieving systemCons:Fish ""hot spots"" are all you need to know, cast same area over and over againGrind - you'll find yourself casting the same spot over and over landing fish over and over to levelLocations limited at this timeMost of those cons should be fixed once they add more locations and boats.  Being limited to a few shore spots at this time really causes a lot of repetition but once you can float around the lake that should make things much more interesting.If you like fishing you will like this game.  If you don't like fishing you might find this game boring at its current build but in the near future things look to be really opening up. "

								Fishing is boring as ♥♥♥♥. However, with the magic of digital money, one-touch shopping, time-advancement technology, unlimited supply of fish and the serenity of nature, void of rednecks and loud ""pro-anglers"", fishing is pretty fun. Gets grindy after awhile from fishing the same fish at the same spot, and really i started to miss human connection in this game. Sometimes I fish, not for the sport of it but I fish because I need someone to accompany me, you know? Im really lonely in there			"

Newbie Review: Fishing PlanetHello everyone! This is my first review ever for a game on Steam, and I do intend to get better at it as I continue reviewing my favorite games, so don't be too harsh on me, OK? WARNING: A lot of text ahead! Please skip to TL;DR if you're not into this kind of reviews.This game popped up on Steam, and my first thought was ""A Free-to-Play fishing MMO? What's that?"". This game was free to download so I decided to give it a try. This game is in Early Access  so many features are absent at the moment but the core gameplay and the main mechanics of the game are absolutely clearly visible and I like them a great deal already. The game has a small but concise and precise tutorial, and a hint system was added recently so anyone new to the game in particular or to the genre as a whole will have a decent possibility to dive right in without any significant problems. In my first 30 minutes or so of gameplay, I realized that getting experience and unlocking new equipment was quite hard and similar to a grind of some kind, but the developers are constantly working on the game and they did improve the experience gain system, leveling up become easier even without a premium account (I hadn't put any money into this game up to this point and I think it won't be necessary at any point in the near future, and this I also like a great deal). This game does require a little bit of fishing knowledge to get the full experience out of it. However, this doesn't mean you have to be a fishing expert to play this game properly. I went fishing (IRL, I mean) a couple of times so I have some basic information about where to search for fish, what bait to use and so on. So, from a casual gamer and a newbie fisherman standpoint, this game is quite easy to understand, very chill and relaxing (awesome graphics and sound effects do get the work of chilling you out done quite nicely), and of course it is reasonably entertaining. As of the moment of this review being posted, there are no multiplayer components in this game aside from the chat (which, to be frank, I haven't even used yet), but it doesn't take a lot from the game in its current status.As of right now, this is more of an enjoyable single-player fishing sim than an MMO, but the game is still quite good. Controls in this game are quite intuitive and also there is a full key binding map available if you press F1 in-game.I have very little to say about the negative aspects of this game, but there are some nonetheless. First and foremost, you have a limited amount of fish you can catch and carry away (in other words, your storage capacity is limited, just like IRL), but there is no clear indication  on the interface itself of whether you have storage capacity left or not. You have to go to your inventory and check that from time to time. In my opinion, it would be more comfortable to see your storage capacity indicated, for example, in the left hand bottom corner of the screen. The second  annoying thing in this game is that your hook may get stuck, the popup says you can free the hook, but out of 10 cases of being stuck I didn't manage to get my hook back. It's either an annoying bug or my hands just being not straight enough (which is indeed a possibility when it comes to gaming).Now, I quit this extensive babbling, and get straight to the TL;DR SectionTL;DRPros:- awesome sound and graphics- intuitive controls- relaxing gameplay- true F2P, very few premium items- constant improvements in the gameCons (those will hopefully get fixed)- no multiplayer just yet- your hook often gets stuck and you have to cut the line most of the time- no indication of spare storage capacity directly on the HUD, it may be usefulDo I recommend this game? If you are into fishing or fishing simulators and want to relax a little bit, then give this game a try right now. You will need to play about 15 to 30 minutes after you have completed the tutorial to make your mind about this game in its current state. Bear in mind that it will get updated. And I also may need to update my review if the devs introduce some major changes (which they hopefully will).P.S. If you have time and desire to do so, please give your feedback on what I need to do in order to improve my reviews. Healthy and reasonable criticism is also very much accepted. ))			"

								There is a bug which when you are traveling that makes the game load for a while and nothing will happen, and if you restart the game it will work but all your money you spent on the travel will be gone and you are still in the main meny.This makes it (atleast for me) impossible to travel since I don't have any money.

								I've played almost every fishing game ever.Fishing Planet = 9/10. Will surely be the best fishing game available once they add everything else, boats, kayaks, new locations, tournaments, etc.This game is for true simulation/realism lovers. You hear the grass, trees, just the right bugs, the water, your rod and reel, wind, air, nothing else. Reminds me of heading out to Granny and Poppies old farm house, catching grasshoppers and fishing the pond, or fishing under the bridge out by Snow Hill Road for bass and catfish with my buddies. I really miss bass fishing back home, this game gives me my fix! I have played almost every fishing game ever created. I'm a die hard. This one is by far the best. Not for arcade fishing lovers. This is the real simulation of fishing.			"

								I really want this game to be good. I understand it is in EA, so I'm hoping the problems get ironed out. It needs a modern video settings menu. Because this game with awesome HD textures maxed out would be beautiful! Also there may be some stability issues, I had 2 crashed in my time playing the game so far. Controls are surprisingly intuitive. Make the fixes, and when you are ready to sell this game, don't do freemium. The market for this game is going to be mainly people who love to fish, you won't pull in non-outdoorsy people to play this. Make it great, and I'd bet it would do well at $30.  "

								This is probably the single most greatest achievement in my life. I have never played a more perfect game. To the way you cast, to the astmosphere, this game has it all. The world looks beautiful as I stand by the water casting my line, and then I get a bite! I reel it in a little, let it pull, and then pull it out of the water! I've never experienced anything like it before! There is even a multiplayer part to the game! You can fish with all of your friends! As you all fish in the same area you can see what everyone else is catching around you! My friends and I all had a blast sitting here one rainy night, all fishing together. It was a great experience and I hope that everyone else comes and joins us too! And if that wasn't enough to get you to get this game, then perhaps me saying that its free will get you to come and try it out! Plus the game is super easy to get into! Even those that don't like fishing can simply walk around the beautifullly constructed world. I can't wait to see you all down by the pond!			"

								Great game so far. It has really great graphics and it is really in depth in terms of fishing. The only problem is that it shouldn't be free. Even if you only charged a dollar you could start making money to improve the game. A game with this detail should really be a paid game. Keep up the great work! I give it a solid 8/10			"

								Fishing Planet is a fishing simulation sport game, where you play as a fisher and buying licenses to different regions and catching different fishes, either SP, MP or co-op cross platforms.First of all, the game spare you the smell of fish, and secondly you get the game for free. The game offers a perfect overview of a fishing experience while thinking about life. The game starts to throw you through a tortorial, how to fish, what kind of bait to use and many other advanced fishing techniques.You will have a inventory as player, where you can move around the fishing spots or travel by plane to find and catch better fish at better locations. You have the option to change time according to best time of catching fishes etc. When you catch a fish you can either release it or keep it to gain a reward. The reward is being used to buy better bait and other equipment. You do have a option to buy ingame cash for real time money, to get better equipment to catch better and bigger fishes.For a free game, with a bunch of DLC's, the game offers a great fishing simulation sport game for those who loves fishing or wishes to learn about it. So if you are sitting with a fisher feeling in your stomach and want to learn something or relax in your home and run away from the fish smell, then this game is for you. Here is a demo:

								This is probably the single most greatest achievement in my life. I have never played a more perfect game. To the way you cast, to the astmosphere, this game has it all. The world looks beautiful as I stand by the water casting my line, and then I get a bite! I reel it in a little, let it pull, and then pull it out of the water! I've never experienced anything like it before! There is even a multiplayer part to the game! You can fish with all of your friends! As you all fish in the same area you can see what everyone else is catching around you! My friends and I all had a blast sitting here one rainy night, all fishing together. It was a great experience and I hope that everyone else comes and joins us too! And if that wasn't enough to get you to get this game, then perhaps me saying that its free will get you to come and try it out! Plus the game is super easy to get into! Even those that don't like fishing can simply walk around the beautifullly constructed world. I can't wait to see you all down by the pond!			"

								After some time i came back to this game, happy to play it again since i had quite a few hours of fun.As of now the prices to play are of the charts, i played around a year ago the price increase is seriously over 100x easily1 day adv. licence in florida is now 4000 for example instead of the 360 it was before, also travel costs will add another 1800. Baits drastically increased in price.Amount of online players, low. +-1.450 as i am righting thisIt takes days and days to break even on your trips as non premium player, even when going after more expensive fish like trout and bass. I have to say that the game is very enjoyable to play, it looks nice too, only the economic inflation is too extreme.Sadly unistalling. "

								At one point I supported this game. I even bought the DLC for it. Recently they actually removed DLC items from players accounts replacing it with inferior items claiming balance issues. They have added cooldown timers which effect players that are even playing with a premium account. They want you to buy baitcoin to bypass this timer. Shouldn't premium time in the game bypass this?The best lures are now locked behind a paywall of baitcoin with no real way to earn baitcoins in game.Went from a decent fishing simulator to a real life work-out for your credit card. Don't believe me just check out the DLC it's priced the same as a AAA game.Update: January, 19th, 2017.     Now the devs are having the mods deleting any negative threads or posts on the forums.This shows that they are aware they are in the wrong and are trying to purge the forums of any of their wrong-doing. I'm just glad that they can not delete reviews. If you do try the game I would strongly advise against giving this developer any money. They sold us DLC then ripped us off.			"

								This game changed the way I live drastically. Now, I will acknowledge that it appears I only have approximately six minutes played on Fishing Planet, but let me be honest: Those six minutes were damn well near the best six minutes of my life. I changed from an isolated and depressed 30-year-old man with an anime body pillow into a 30-year-old virtual fishing master with no time to be distracted by my animated girlfriend. The simple, yet elegant act of catching virtual fish encouraged me to contemplate my life and motivated me to abandon my sweet high-school waifu and become a competitive E-Sports fisherman. I was an atheist until I played this game; I'm now a firm believer of Christ and this game is a clear reincarnation of him. I have achieved a state of Nirvana. I am God.			"

SummaryFree to play but works best with a quite expensive premium account. As a simulation it's quite amazing with different types of fish having different habits, preferring different baits, and each kind can vary greatly in size. You really need to plan your approach and know your trade to be succesful. Definitely not that easy to learn and pretty hard to master. I can easily recommend this one, if you are prepared to buy premium, at least in the beginning, to level up a bit and have more fish to choose from.Pros1. It's free so you can check it out for yourself. 2. There are many different kinds of fish, including normal, young, trophy, and unique variants. Each fish has its habits and preferences so you can't use the same approach all the time, you must really tailor it accordingly.3. While premium account really helps a lot, it is not a requirement as there is no way to simply buy levels or high-level equipment without hard work. Premium speeds it up significantly, but if you are patient enough, you will achieve the same thing. The main hindrance of not having premium account is cash - you really need to make your stay in each state profitable and this is much harder without premium account and lower prices for fish that you catch, especially on lower levels. 4. Graphics are pretty good.5. Community is really friendly and other players can tell you how they are so succesful using in-game chat. I have not encountered even one instance of real rudeness. 6. There is a lot of gear to choose from allowing a lot of customization. 7. You can always check which fish are available at each lake, along with what to catch them with.8. There are a lot of decent guides on Steam and YouTube so you can learn the ropes without too much trouble. 9. The game is pretty stable and I haven't encountered any game-breaking bugs. 10. I love the travelling system. You can't just go anywhere you please, you have your home state, and each trip costs some money - you really need to plan them well to make them profitable, especially at lower levels. 11. You can still catch quite a lot of fish, contrary to most reviews here, it just takes skill and luck. I can catch 35 lbs of catfish in about 15 minutes, although I never really counted it, and I don't have a very high level, nor DLC or baitcoin gear. Cons1. There are some graphical glitches, like people warping across the lake, but nothing annoying. 2. Premium account is pretty expensive.3. Rooms are small, I would love to play with more other people, exchanging experiences and competing. 4. Weather changes are definitely not subtle. Note - I do have a premium account, I bought baitcoins once, and own no DLCs.			"

								At first, my thoughts were ""why on earth am I playing a fishing game when I don't even like fishing?"". However, I quickly began to realise that the people who play this game are all really nice and they all seem to contribute to the fun, relaxing atmosphere of the game. In my opinion, Fishing Planet has a lot of potential, perhaps as a game perhaps aimed at an older audience, and could even attract people who are inexperienced in fishing, such as myself, by going into more detail in explanations and tutorials, etc. Overall, I'd say give it a try if you want a relaxing and peaceful experience, and if it's not your thing then just uninstall it.

								While this game is far from perfect it is one of the best fishing games out there. The game is very grindy but it can be a lot of fun. It's definitely not a game that appeals to a wide audience, but those of you who have played other fishing games I think will find this one pretty good. It's not an exciting game and doesn't have the same level of interaction that many MMO's do, but if you are looking for a casual way to relax and catch some fish than this will probably fit the bill nicely for you.Pros:-No one way to catch a fish-Casual pacing and style-Great graphics-Stable-Simple interface-Great variety of lures so farCons:-Very Grindy-Repetitive-Basically a single player game with chat-Not a lot of reason to chat with other players except to get help on fishing setups-In-game music needs a lot of love.-No true bottom fishing-Not enough GUI flexibility yetI'd consider this game to be in the middle of beta as far as content and bugs. It has a few key features still missing and a lot hammering, but can be enjoyable for those playing now. They have a lot of features still to add that are planned. I do wish that the patch cycle would speed up a bit.			"

								Fantastic game for a game just coming out of beta Graphics are amazing , Controls not too difficult. Minor down sides its very slow placed ... takes alot of time to level up( I know its a simulator) my advice to whoever is just starting listen to music while you play this game it definitly helps alot. I forgot to mention the Community is very friendly most of them are beta testers and they give alot of tips and tricks into catching certain fish. I definitly recommend this game. 10/10 hope to see you in game!			"

								Firstly, let me clear something up, I am not a fan of fishing in real life or in a game. However, that does not mean I have not enjoyed the good things this game has had to offer, and it was surprising that I have enjoyed the game as much as I have.Pros:-The game has a very relaxing atmosphere, beautiful environment and great gear and fish to experience in different weather, along with a satisfactory amount of locations (would like to see more though, much more)-The battles you have when you finally get a fish on the line can be pretty epic, and the disappointment when you lose one equally as epic and heartbreaking, but enjoyable none the less and a large reason of why the game can be so enjoyable.-Managing your gear setups, and having the right gear for the right fish and situation, really defines this game from a point of view of what makes this a strong game and as close to a simulation as one might imagine of a real life fishing experience in that regard.-Now (last update) you can see your friends fish as they have added the ability to see other people fishing in the same room. Yet to decide how this feature sits with me, but for now it’s been fine.-New Dynamic Fishing system, so you have to go and search out the fish, unlike before where they were static and predictably always in the same locations.-The feeling of when you catch something rare or big, such as a new personal record this can be very exciting. Sadly, these moments become less and less frequent the more you play the game, nevertheless this is something that makes you go back for more.-Helping each other out, friends and even strangers happy to help out with tips and tricks to catch certain types of fish, it is nice that people share information to help each other catch more fish more frequently.Cons:-The Grind, initially you have a reasonably decent progression, and you get new things, get new types of fish, unlock new locations and all seems to be going ok. Then as you level up to higher levels, though not the highest, more like between early and mid-levels. You realize how much of a grind you have ahead of you, just to unlock a new thing like a new area, new gear and new fish types. The grind is brutally painful.-Premium unlike some games where you can earn a premium status, this game requires real money transaction as the only way to get yourself into a premium status. Very Money driven new implementations in last update. And premium people get more game currency and xp rewards, so It makes it less grindy experience if you pay for it. And after every ingame day, the game reminds you of your status as premium or not. Just to let you know how important it is to have premium. This new feature really pisses me off.-Last update has increased the costs of things across the board, while the ratio to earnings was reduced. So the gap was increased. The game was already out of balance in this regard, now it is more so. Coupled with the fact that catching fish is more challenging now, it simply means more grind, for both pay and free players.-""Fast forward time"" while fishing now isn’t just a simple necessary feature, no they decided to try and monetise it by adding a cooldown. So when you fill your bag after a day’s fishing and need/must forward time, you can find yourself waiting around doing nothing for the cooldown to run out because they forgot that if your bag is full you shouldn’t have to wait for a stupid cooldown to go home for the night to come back the next day. And if you do pay to have premium, you don’t even skip the cooldown, you simply reduce the cool down. This feature was incredibly badly thought out and implemented and should be reverted back to how it was.-The new system of lure fishing doesn’t seem to show properly, it was supposed to be fixed, but it still only works randomly. And furthermore to this, some of the other techniques like twitching seem to be broken now, so hopefully they can fix these things. Also the Fishing Rod Physics are now bugged in latest release which also needs fixing. Don't know why they update the game with bugs as clear as this, worked fine prior to update, makes no sense why they would break it and release it broken.-Licenses last a real life day. Instead of a game day. This is so ridiculous. If you only have 30 mins to fish one night, well too bad you pay for a full license. The costs really add up and hurt, the game is not friendly to casual players. It is heavily trying to stimulate long play sessions so that you might actually get some value from your playtime. Otherwise you can find yourself losing money, because of the stacking costs of Licenses. You could basically end up in scenario where you spend 5 or more in real life days fishing just one day in the game, however you have to pay for 5 Days’ worth of Fishing license. Simply makes no sense.-If you make enough money in a day, but don't have enough before going to your trip to cover the costs of the 2nd day, yes you pay to fish in game daily in addition to licenses. The game simply boots you back home, essentially losing the benefit of being out fishing. So even if you made say 10k and have plenty of fish, the game doesn't know to use what you caught to pay for the next day, watch out for this, it is really annoying when it first happens to you. It will simply force you home, even though you made more than enough to cover the costs. The message says ""Stay ended"" your stay on the pond has ended, you don't have enough money to stay longer. But you do, the game is just so badly made, that it won't recognize it. Really infuriating.-Lack of an audio cue for when you need to strike, (as an optional feature, would be great) because it really can be rather sad at times, that I have to sit there staring at a float all day hoping for a bite. Would be nice to be able to look at something else and have an audio queue when I need to strike and reel in the fish. Visual only cue is a bit limiting of times I’m willing to play the game. As it does take a certain amount of focus, an audio cue would really allow people to do other things while not missing out on catching the fish, because they are forced to stare at the float intently.Summary:Barely Recommending this, the game has its moments and it is free (time is money so the term free is used loosely in this case), so it is worth at least giving it a chance. You can have some relaxing moments and some excitement too all in one, but I do find I have to be in a specific mood to play this and I have to allow enough time to make it worthwhile. If you are into fishing, then It would make sense that you like this game. And if you are not, give it a try, who knows you might learn something, I know I did.			"

								While the beginning is pretty boring what with catching Bluegills and all, it's worth it to get to level three so you can start using lures.  Bass and Catfish are possible at level 2, but you'll probably catch more Bluegills than anything.  Once you get some spoons and jigs, the real fun begins and levelling goes much faster from there.  I sat down with a six pack of beer and before I knew it a couple hours had passed and I was out of beer.I like that the game tries to teach you proper fishing techniques, which you can then apply to real world fishing.  I've learned a few things and will try them out next time I get on a boat because shore fishing in my area is pretty poor.  Overall it's a great game with lots of potential.			"

								It's so close to being a good game that I wish I could give it a neutral rating instead of a Good or bad rating. The Good: The graphics and physics of the game are well done. The environments look and sound really good, lots of realism and depth. When you catch and reel in a fish it seems like one of the more realistic games I've played. There are a number of places you can fish and a number of species to fish for making it very diverse in the long run for someone that has reached the max level and unlocked / bought all the gear available to them. The Bad:  Your ability to enjoy this game is completely dependant upon your willingness to spend REAL money, and how much you're willing to spend. It's also dependant upon you being able to grind. If all you did was play the free version of the game, it's not enjoyable. It's boring, too much of a grind to ever really be fun. You waste too much in-game currency traveling back and forth between bodies of water as you level up. It also limits the amount of in-game cash you can earn by the size of your stringer, which is expensive to upgrade so it's a catch-22 getting out of low level, boring areas unless you open your REAL wallet and spend REAL money on one or all of the 3 things this game pretty much forces you buy. In game you have 2 currencies: A cash currency and a baitcoin currency. Cash is spent on average gear, baitcoins are spent on high-end gear. Both of the in-game currencies can be farmed by grinding (spending hours fishing while knowing where to fish, what to fish for, and what to fish with), OR you can skip the grind and just use real, hard-earned money to buy the currencies. The cash is cheaper than the baitcoins. Of course, this is how all free-to-play games make their money. For you to enjoy the game at the highest level you'll be spending a fair amount of REAL money on a regular basis. The game baits you into spending money on yet another near-necessity if you plan on playing a lot: A Premium Account!  A premium account allows you to grind through levels (40 of them) at a 50% increased rate over someone that has a regular account. Lets not forget that you also  make in-game cash about 50% quicker. The premium account monthly subscription is $14.99 per month, the cost of a WoW subscription. And then if you plan on bouncing back and forth between lakes fishing for ""fun"" fish and buying ""good"" gear you're going to be burning a hole in your real wallet paying for in-game currencies to make that happen. Why? Because the game charges you THOUSANDS of in-game dollars to travel to a particular body of water, but you cannot recover the thousands you spent in a single trip. So if you leave the lake, with a stringer of, say, $1,000 worth of fish, you have essentially lost money fishing there. How do you recover that money? By fishing the starter lake, which is little more than a pond, for HOURS until you've made enough to afford another trip! Or, <suprise suprise> You can just use your credit card to buy some cash to get out of the little pond in Texas and do some real fishing. Imagine that!  PAY TO WIN ladies and gentlemen. Those who pay to play will leave the average player in the dust and enjoy fishing more bodies of water for more species and sizes of fish. Its just that simple. SERVER DISCONNECTS AND CLIENT FREEZES I just had a server disconnect while reeling in maybe the biggest fish I have ever caught.  In 6 hours of playing I've had more than a few server disconnects and client freezes. It's not my computer. I have a custom gaming PC that I keep updated and CLEAN! I have a 300 Mbps connection, a Nighthawk router, and my NIC is a PCI-E Wireless AC1900 card with 3 high-gain antenna. In almost every game I play my ping is lower than just about everyone I play with and it's rock-solid steady. How this could be better: Stop charging people in-game currency to travel back and forth between bodies of water! I understand, and even like, spending in-game currency on gear. That makes sense to me. But this is a video game. It shouldn't feel like WORK to have to grind out money just so you can go fish where you want to fish.  And also: Fix the server instability issues.

								I'm an angler in real life and I play games as well, so I can review this game from both perspectives.As a fishing sim: this sucks balls-the listed species for each fishing location lie; there are only 6 species shown when there may be more and it says, for example, ""pike"" or ""trout"" instead of the actual species like ""grass pickerel"" (which is a member of the ""esox"", or pike, family)-getting snagged in this game is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  Once you get snagged, often for no reason, the hook is stuck forever and the only way to retrieve it is to turn up your drag and yank repeatedly until the hook comes out. 9/10 times the line breaks and you lose line and a lure.-this is a free-to-play game that has a leveling system and premium currency.  That means a lure you want requires real money to get (just use that money to get an actual lure and go fishing) and you can't fish for what you want to fish for since 1. some of the starting map's fish and all other fish from other lakes require a ""license"" that costs money and 2. equipment required to catch fish may be unavailable until you reach a certain level.  I guess this is a simulator because you literally pay for lures, line, rods, reels, bait, and everything else you could fish with in real life.-fishing, in real life, is rarely consistent.  Fish will change feeding habits and locations without warning.  Then why does fishing planet have tutorials where you can catch fish in the same spot again and again?As a game? Hmm....-as i said before, the free-to-play model is ♥♥♥♥ and I don't want to give them money.  TheHunter, a game with a similar business model, is actually good with this and I gladly give them my money.  For some reason, it has worse reviews due to the free-to-play model.  That makes zero sense.-The gameplay mechanics are broken.  Fishing in real life is more exciting.-Say you have the license to fish for something you'd want to catch...There is NO information how to fish for species.  NONE.  You have to google it just to know where exactly to cast and what bait to use.Plus, it sounds like they are banning people with negative things to say on forums? I haven't experienced this but it sounds shady.quit this and play TheHunter or better yet,  The Witcher 3. That game is dope.  0/10			"

								I have played a bit and I think I understand enough to write a review. Here's the skinny: First off you don't have to pay a dime for anything to enjoy this game. It has, by far, the best payment model of any free to play game i've played. You don't have to spend a dime on anything. Ever. Everything sold as DLC is also sold in the shop. This does not mean that buying DLC is bad. You get some real bonuses for buying DLC. The number one bonus being that if you buy a DLC package then your rod/reel can never fully break. Second most important bonus is that you can repair most of the DLC items with in game credits instead of in game gold. Now, before you trip on the Gold/Cash thing this is where the payment model shines. You can earn gold in game and it's not hard or impossible. Flat out, not a pay to win by any means of the phrase. Gameplay: It is skill based. Also, being good means having knowledge.Last is the community. Nobody will tell you to, ""Die Pleb"" or ""Roll out, Noob."" Everyone is there to help everyone else.			"

								I have been pc gaming for 30 years, at least.  Last time I had played a game so addictive was when the first silent hunter came out.  Let me be plain about it.. this is the best game , of any genre , i have played in many years.  Who needs summer with the bugs and heat when you have this? the graphics are awesome, the fishing is extremely realistic, but graduated for newbies, The locations are varied as are the fish at each location. The community in chat is one of the highlights of the game.  I have yet to run in to more than a couple of a holes... everyone helps everyone,,high level to low. ( except in a tourney..lol).  And you NEED them,,, there are many hidden ways and tricks to get high level fish  ( Trophies, and "" Unique"").  Youtube has many videos ( some good, some bad), that can help but i prefer hunting on my own..but sometimes it 's a grind,  But the chat  community is golden, as i said.The only suggestion I have would be to have a guide to at least tell you  how and where to catch a unique or trophy species.. especially for newer players.  Otherwise the only way to find them is if someone tells you the special spot, time of day, and bait to catch tmem with.  But an outstanding game overall... AND ITS EARLY ACCESS!!! truly worth a few bucks for the DL'cs and soe gold and exp, boosts.  Amazing gaming experience!			"

								The best fishing simulator in steam, at least for now.Pros:- Free 2 Play- Realistic (kind of). You'll need basic knowledge about fishing to be good able to play and enjoy this game, every rod and reel feel different and you'll need to match it with certain line, certain bobber, certain hook, certain lure/bait, certain technique and certain time of the day to land certain fish successfully (don't forget to buy your fishing license or you'll be fined). So many varieties, at first you'll be overwhelmed by it.- Fishing shop. You'll feel like browsing a real fishing shop website, although to buy something you need to meet the level requirement.Cons- Damage mechanism need more polishing, it's a bit unrealistic- Certain items only available in a limited time DLC- Need more contents (not really a con as it's still in early access)9/10			"

								This game is pretty realistic in terms of fishing mechanics and bait types. The graphics have the potential to be incredible if your computer can handle it. I have a Nvidia Gtx 960 superclocked and it runs the graphics on the best settings pretty well, but obviously if you lower the graphics settings it will run at a higher framerate. It can be a little bit of a grind sometimes to get the higher level items, but it still is fun. Since it is a free game there are micro-transactions, but they are not in your face about it and you can easily play the game without them. If you like fishing you will definitly like this game. If I had to give it a rating I would give it a 8/10 since it is a free game with great graphics and good gameplay.			"

Developers really captured the essence of fishing on this one.They nailed it with the graphs, the ambience, the mechanics, plus it's a really FREE TO PLAY GAME.There's nothing in the game you cant buy by fishing and earning achievements. Not spending money, or owning any of the DLCs does not hinder the game at all.If you enjoy fishing, you'll really going to love this game. It's the next best thing. "
