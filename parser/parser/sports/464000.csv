												This is a quality game.  Textures, animation, voice are all excellent.  It's an arcade game and has online scoreboard where you can compete against many others for high scores.  Love it!			"

												A fun trio of active games. They're relatively simple arcade games with a lot of polish, but the VR perspective really makes them shine. I'll be playing these a lot. Fracture is probably my favorite.			"

												ARCADE SAGA is great! imagine games like holoball, racket nx and those longbow games on steroids! 3 polished games with high replay value at a fair price. i like ""fracture"" most, it's an insane fast first person breakout in vr. lots of upgrades and online leaderboards, it's VERY well done!

												This is probably one of my favorite goto games of the 90+ VR games I own; but lets be honest, this game is priced a bit high. :)  Each game is essentially $10 and though there are upgrades you can save up star points to purchase and arguably there are endless hours of gameplay to try and beat your previous score or work the public leaderboards and different game modes to change things up; end to end though you're looking at a minute or two per level.With that said, this game is a lot of fun.  Fracture by far is my favorite.  It plays like HoloBall and has a classic Brick Breaker feel to it.  What is nice is as you advance the levels, not only do the bricks change and technique requirement changes, but so does the arena.  Sometimes you're in a square or sometimes in a dome making the physics of the balls bouncing different so you have to plan your shots accordingly.  The summoning of the ball is a unique feature as well.  Took me some getting used to but once I got the hang of it, it’s a handy feature!Smash is a variant of Fracture in that you’re in a narrow corridor and try to get the balls past the opponent at the other end.  As you advance there are more obstacles, speed variables, mines, etc. to make it more challenging.  You use shields in each hand to hit the ball and add spin to send it to the opponent’s side.  Still ends up feeling the same as Fracture from a mechanics perspective but that is not a bad thing.Bowshot is my least favorite but not terrible.  It is another bow shooter like many others out there.  The charge shot which sends a blue ray to hit more blocks is probably one of the more unique features I’ve seen compared to others.  If you like bow and arrow games, it isn’t bad, just not as fun as the others in my opinion.I posted some raw gameplay footage of a few levels from each game if you’re interested:

			This game is a lot of fun. Fracture is my favorite of the three and they are basically $10 each as the retail cost is currently $30 USD as of the posting of this video.

												MY ARM! lol oh man this game keeps you going for hours. This game is a great game to pass time. You will definently get your money's worth if you purchase this game. You have everything from shooting things with bows to using shields to repel balls into the opponents goal to crushing the s**t out of a ball using a lightsaber bat!Pros: Hours of fun only reason I stopped was because my arm got tired! and even then I could just change game play to a different type of game. Cons: 0IMO GET IT!			"

												Extremely well polished. From the graphics, to the music, to the power ups and achievements it truly feels like you are stuck inside an arcade game. There is voice acting, a small 'plot', well done tutorials, and three games to choose from which helps keep you from getting bored. Thus far it has been a blast. It shows off the Vive system fabulously and really feels like a AAA game. I highly recommend getting it if you are a fan of the old classic arcade game feel, albeit with a modern twist.			"

												I am really enjoying this game!  The brick breaking game is fun and challenging and has for ""worlds"" to unlock which equates to 40 levels, four of which are boss fights.  I have already gotten 8 hours of gameplay out of it and I still have a lot more content to unlock!  The archery is fun and also has 40 levels I think.  The shield blocking game as well.  It's super polished.  I thought it was worth the price!There is a bug or ""feature"" where world 2 of the brick breaking game doesn't unlock unless you hit ""Next"" after beating the first boss.  Don't hit ""Select level"".  Then you need to beat the bonus round and 2-1 in order for it to unlock!  I don't know if its the same for the other bosses because that's the only one I did.  Took me awhile to figure it out.  It was frustrating.			"

												I can see myself playing this game more and more with it's repayable nature and online leaderboards.Upgradable ability's are the icing on the cake, although i wish Smash was a online playable game of it's own!

			A enjoyable mix match of 3 types of arcade style VR games for the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. I can see myself playing this game more and more with it's repayable nature and online leaderboards.		

The graphics are great for what it is, but won't blow your socks off. The price like i say at the end of the video, is one too think about before purchasing this product. In the short while i have played this (I can't wait to faceoff with the bosses) i would say no to anyone critical over the pricing of there games. But taking into account it has a online aspect in it's leaderboard i would assume some of it will go towards the servers keeping track of the scores. I don't know. I have found no reason to give this anything but a thumbs up and look forward to seeing you on the leaderboards! "

												Update...I'm playing this a lot. Yep..worth the money and I'm not just saying that because they paid homage to Sinistar.If the dev team can roll out a player vs player online mode to scratch that discs of tron itch then this game would be super worth it.			"

												This is a very well made game in every aspect.  Great music, good graphics, leaderboards for instant feedback, boss fights, lots of levels, power-ups, upgrades for weapons, and it gets you a great workout at the same time!  They have started to introduce multiplayer which will just add to the playability that's already there.  Must have game in my opinion.  20+ hours so far and many more ahead.I currently have no dislikes for this game.  Great job devs!			"

												Not enough in this game to warrent a $30 price tag. There is barely any depth to the gameplay that is here. Bowshot is decent but less satisfying than The Lab. Visuals are polished but simple to a point where not much amazement can come from a series of cubes. If you are interested, wait for it to go on sale, paying $30 will leave you dissapointed.			"

												I love VR and have been so excited to see it grow, so I've been happy to buy a lot of less polished games for the sake of experiencing something new and supporting new studios doing VR. I was excited to see this because I imagined it as ""first party"" content. Something polished and worth waiting for. Wow. No. I was very wrong. This is probably the least polished and least fun game I have played on the vive. I bought it one of the first days it was out and all the reviews were glowing. ""The kind of game that sucks you in"" ""You will want to play for HOURS."" ""The sound and visuals are top notch"". It sounded perfect.I would be disappointed by this game if it cost even $5 because of how unfinished it feels. Free VR games have felt better. I look forward to each level ending to give me relief from having to play these games. The three games are incredibly simple and, more importantly, not fun. In all of them the physics feels so sloppy and floaty that it's hard to predict how to actually play/move. Bowshot is fast and chaotic but feels like you're just being assaulted by so many things that it's a race to (your) death. I would pick The Lab's archery game ANY day.Fracture has just the most insane physics, and to 3-star the levels, you have to destroy EVERY block. That isn't hard in a regular ""brick breaker"" game, but in this one you're standing in a room with block floating 100ft above you trying to hit a 1ft diameter ball at it. Not at all satisfying. I would guess that maybe I'm awful at this game, but even doing what seems to be terribly I'm in the top 100 global scores so...either no one is playing, or no one is winning. Smash is a little fun...it's like Holoball but worse. The physics again are weird and floaty, the impact of the balls feels off, the randomness of the powerups is bizarre. And it all takes place in what feels like a futuristic sewer pipe. That brings me to my next point. The visuals? Garbage. Muddy textures, no shadows, poor reflections, static background. It's really about as poor as I've seen in any VR game. The sound too makes me embarrassed for the creators. The voice of the main AI sounds like an announcer at Chucky Cheeses and they call themselves the ""We"" which, in that high pitched enthusiastic voice, is impossible to take seriously. All in all, I have not had any fun in this game, I am disappointed by what they delivered, and I feel faily lied to about what it was. The $30 price tag is outrageous for this type of game, but I can only hope they use those funds to make something more...			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but I think I hate it:- In Smash, the ball will rebound at crazy angles or gain unexpected amounts of speed so frequently that there's little point trying to predict where it will go and it becomes purely a game of reflexes.  Don't try to tell me it's the product of a realistic physics engine, I don't believe such exaggerated spin effects would occur in real life.  Also, many opponents can cheesily fire it back at you from the middle of the level; the player is given no such power-up.- In Bowshot, the enemies shoot at you and their indestructible shots are often very large.  In my 2m x 1.5m play space, it's not possible for me to get out of their way without flattening myself against the furniture or onto the floor, often ending up in corners of dodgy tracking and having the world spin nauseatingly.- I feel like the huge global high score table at the end of the level is taunting me.When I complete a song in Audioshield, I feel elated.  When I finish a level in Arcade Saga, unless it was one of the first few levels on Casual difficulty, I feel like I've been beaten up. "

												There is no original gameplay in this, for a steam backed VR special it's lacking. The graphics are good but smash makes no sense, tracking in that is dreadful. The other is a pong remake that is just a rinse and repeat style game. Bowshot kinda has some potential but it's extremely tiring with the same arm movements.			"
