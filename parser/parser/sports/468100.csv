Early Access Review
								I loved playing Wave Race on the gamecube and hoped to get a game in the spirit of wave race and i have not been disappointed. The pros: - Great summer holiday feeling with really nice fresh water- Could be a successor to Waverace Bluestorm, very similar feel but also feels fresh- Good wave physics, makes fun to dive in- Tons of modes incl. Freeride (like in Waverace :-)- Very intense gameplay with good weather effects - Graphics is from clean/functional (what i like) to really beautiful- I counted 40 courses in 9 different enviroments!- Couldn't see any bugs (Early Access, but nearly finished i think)Cons:- No replays (that would make the game perfect to me)- No course with snow/iceThank you Zordix-Devs for making this great game. I love to play it.			"

												what i liked about this game was the complexity of various gamemodes, and the funny easter eggs, and such as multiplayer mode with lots of different maps and other things as customisation. and i also liked the realistic graphics with water.But the best thing is: i played this game at the company's office!!!!!! it was sooooo cool.what i didn't like about this game was that it can be a bit weird with the first person camera angle, but nothing else seems to be problematic.i would recommend this game to anyone that likes fun racing but also i recommend it to anyone that loves great games.i give this game a strong 8.5/10 :)			"

Early Access Review
								Great modern update to Wave Race 64!Ok this has nothing to do with WR64 officially but its obvious that game inspired this one.Forget 'Blue Storm', this game controls much better than that game and feels much closer to WR64 than that game ever did.The game is good. It has the feel of Wace race 64 but with much more tracks and obviously much better graphics. The control feels lovely to me, i was weaving around those bouys and getting 'Great' scores on my first race!.If i'm being honest, i did feel the price was a little high for a new Early Access game, but the game already is crammed full of content (something like 12 tracks/worlds each with multiple tracks).If you are a fan of Wave Race, or just old arcade style racers in general, give the game a shot, you WILL like it.

Early Access Review
								If your looking for a water racer like Riptide but much better, then this is it. Decent enough arcade game for £15.Personally, I was hoping for an enhanced version of Wave Race 64 or Blue Storm(probably because plenty were saying it was a Wave Race successor). What I got is a kind of  game you'd find in your local arcade with a full size Jet-Ski attached. Great for a few minutes fun with your mates. It just doesn't feel like your interacting with the water in general, and in particular the waves. There are waves(big waves at the 'Shipyard' course) but you can't utilise the wave, like getting air or dipping in to it to keep control- you just cant pitch your craft in the water or air. I can see waves, but it plays flat! Over a few days I ran 3 championships several times in Aqua, then 1 in Wave Race 64 on an emulator, then twice on Blue Storm on my old GameCube, then played Aqua again. Even Wave Race 64 seems light years ahead when it comes to riding the waves and overall interaction with the water.Why didn't the developers reverse engineer the Wave Race games(the 'classics' as the developer calls them) if that's what they were going for?Of course, I can't blame the developers that they chose not to make a next-gen Wave Race. I suppose they've got to produce what they think will make them money.			"

												Important note for review: There are two types of personal water crafts (PWCs) in this game. Runabouts (the large sit-down type) and Skis (the nimble stand-up type). A review after 4 hours:Let's get the negatives out of the way first, because you're probably worried about them and decided to look at some reviews first. I was aware before buying this game that it had a reputation for aggressive AI, or in other words: opponents that like to ram you. Well that's not quite the case. The real cause of that is the vehicle ""mass,"" or ""weight."" Both you and your opponents are very easy to knock around. In the Ski division this isn't really a problem, but it heavily affects the Runabout division. Why? Size. You just make contact far more often, and frustratingly it really does affect your racing lines, which is already tough to keep tidy because you're driving on water. Also, in theory, the runabouts have longer tail sections (sticking out past the axis on which the watercraft model pivots) making them easier to spin out.Now, I was sure to play at least two thirds of the tournaments to get good data, and while these things do occur, they don't happen near enough to deem it ""game-breaking."" But they sure are noticable, so you can never quite feel safe knowing your lap can be ruined in an instant.Player Solutions: Never intentionally make contact, and if you're hung up on an opponent just get off the throttle. Usually their racing line is messed up too, so the sooner you get off of them the sooner you can pass them.Developer Tweaks(?): Maybe try increasing the ""weight"" of the runabouts so they don't react so drastically with collisions with opponents. Also, if it doesn't make aerial spins look weird, maybe trying moving the turning axis a bit to the rear so it's less easy to be spun-out by opponents.And now for the Positives!-This is easily the best looking PWC racing game I have ever played.-Fun, especailly in the ski division.-Sense of humor.-Surprising amount of customization, including 1 or more areas for color changing on the PWCs AND a satisfying character creation including height, build, gender, multiple faces, eye color, clothing & gear, hair, and even some basic tattoos.-Don't like the announcer? You can pick a different one! Don't like either of them? You can turn them both off!!-Satisfying controls and trick system.-Challenging tracks! The other racers won't be the only thing challenging you as you progress, and there are many variations of the tracks and 3 weather presets. I'm 2/3 of the way done with both divisions and I feel like I haven't raced the same course twice!-Pop culture reference from the year 2000. I won't ruin it for you, but it made me smile and I had to mention it somehow. -Decent music. It's not licensed music like back in the days of Splashdown for PS2 but it's enjoyable and not too weird or generic.-Compatible with an Xbox One controller but will also automatically detect an Xbox 360 wired controller. No setup required, from my experience.-Free roam mode allows you chill out and check out each unique area that each of the multiple races are routed through.Conclusion: If you're a fan of watersports games new and old from Splashdown to Wave Race to Riptide GP2, then Aqua Moto Racing Utopia is totally worth the buy. At 30 dollars, this game looks great, has plenty of features for a modern entry to the genre, and presents a good challenge. I'm happy with the purchase, and I hope the developers continue to support this game and maybe make an outstanding sequel in the future! One can only hope. Devs, thanks for keeping the genre alive and here's hoping you get even more funding for the future.			"

												I got this game in Winter Sale and hoped that it was like the good old Nintendo Wave Race.I played it for like half an hour and was pretty disappointed: The setting and the races were just like Wave Race, but the handling wasn't at all, it was not that hard to control like Wave Race (except maybe for the big wave map ""oil rig"").Another day I gave it another shot with 3 friends and i have to say that after I spent some time with it, I really enjoyed it and played the solo races afterwards as well.The setting and the graphics are gorgeous, the maps are diverse, you just have to feel good at these locations. Combined with the first person view it get's pretty immersive and you feel the flow (although you see less and it gets harder that way, of course).The gameplay itself is less based on just controlling the vehicle (like Wave Race as i mentioned before) but on fluidly and tightly getting around the markers, which feels like drifting with a car. If you get used to it (which happens quickly) it's remarkably enjoyable.In contrast to some other early access titles i played, this game has no (apparent) bugs and you can see that the developers put love into it. There are the small things like the ego view, the multiplayer minigames and of course the local multiplayer feature itself which will keep me coming back.The downside is, that for nowadays, it's not a lot of content. I think that the game is actually somewhat overprized, but if you get it in sale, it's alright....And I wouldve liked an polar type map, even if it's not realistic, but no blame for that. "

Aqua Moto Racing Utopia ReviewIntroduction         How much mist aggregates under the elusive solace of a calming spray of mist such as Six Flags in the middle of a summer’s day? My brother and I when we were younger used to spray each other with water guns soaking each other in the calmness of the water. What makes water so calm when people bathe in its alluring hypotonic and hypertonic solutions? Aqua Moto Racing spreads out this mist on the elusiveness of the skin when others go through the waves of life. Does water hold only physical attributes, or also, an enchanting calm during tribulations and storms in life? It is a known fact that water for ages has calmed the soul as well as relaxed the mind to reach its stable conditional state. Aqua Moto Racing Utopia provides us this same peace which is rare to find in the clamor of normal day-to-day life in the real world.What separates Aqua Moto Racing making it unique are the nine different environments included as maps in the game. It ranges from clear blue water to dark water with a combination of low waves closer to sea level, then those extreme waves in which force you to keep your balance to make it on top of the leaderboards. Environmental examples are Aquatic Dream, Metropolis Trip, Inside the Dome, Oil Rig, Exotic Waters “ Jungle River,” Tricenter Arena “ Triple Ripple,” Mangrove Mania “ Alligator Swamplands” and much more. It is a blend of Wave Race 64 with the water physics of Hydro Thunder Hurricane, although more improved. How will it stand up compared to other games in its genre? Let’s now dissect it to find out.Gameplay/Mechanics     The objectives differ in comparison based on the game mode you select from the main menu. There are a variety of different modes from single races, time trial, tournaments ( water boat and jet ski), racing cups, and, of course, your final stunt championship competitions. When entering Aqua Moto Racing Utopia for the first time, you may want to get yourself familiar with all the controls, actually write down all stunt combinations having a cheat sheet on hand in dire emergencies. The tutorial does not do the game the justice and praise it deserves because it forces you to perform types of air stunts when it is a course that has the smallest amount of waves in height, making you unable or very hard to steer, control when pressing LT to execute the stunt across an inclined ramp. Usually, with racing games, I skip the tutorial and head over to the actual game modes, the meat of the whole game in itself. Races pit you aside seven other computer controlled players at different difficulties of beginner, novice, advanced, pro, and expert. The objective normally is to steer carefully around markers called buoys on their designated correct side; red, right; yellow; left.      The level of difficulty determines how many of these buoys will be placed in the water. Usually, they are either placed diagonally in a zigzag pattern or evenly spread out around each lap. There are three laps in the tournament, career mode. Every lap is the same as the previous one and follows a general pattern of buoy placement. Water physics play a huge role in this game by controlling the speed and velocity in which you travel. The water, of course, controls the motion of your jet ski, water boat determining which maps and sections of each environment will give you the best advantage in racing to perform stunts of your choice and get air time. A boost meter fills up when you perform stunts having hang time through hopping across ramps, and when maneuvering around the buoys. You are rated on your performance right after you turn through either a rating of great or perfect.      Luckily, you can auto reset your waterboat and jet ski if you need to, in case, you get into an area where you get stuck or are not out of bounds in which the game will automatically reposition you within three seconds of time. I find that the advanced cups in the racing championship are the most challenging so far because it is the first time you have players bumping against each other, railing each other similar to all Dirt games made by Codemasters. I can only imagine the rage that would be induced if later I intend to try to play Aqua Moto Racing Utopia online with people bumping me right and left so I purposely miss the buoys and become disqualified. You are automatically disqualified from a race if you miss three buoy points. Now, sometimes, as is the case with one particular map variation called the Oil Rigs, you will have too much hangtime sometimes where it drifts you to the sides of the map, thus missing a couple buoy points when heading towards getting in the top three placement at the end of the championship cup. This is rather unfortunate but is something that has always been included in rally racing games as well as games like Split/Second for consoles back on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.      The last notable feature of each race, are the obstacles you encounter. Mainly, only in the swamplands where you have to drive through marshlands to beat the rest of the crowd. Sometimes, you can accidently make the mistake of peering off to the side, hitting branches and twigs, completing wiping out and resetting your position. Racing is the easiest of all modes and is fair, accommodating to gamers. We can customize our primary, secondary colors on our water boats and jet skis from a whole color palette of natural colors used in painting, art. The second mode besides racing is the stunt mode. The stunt mode places a time limit much like Dirt 3 did within one of its modes. In this, you have to generate as many stunts across ramps, either air, water stunts or a combination of both in the allotted time limit provided before us.Presentation     The graphics are on par with the Wii U according to modern-day standards. The developer has stated this is the very reason for the lower video ram recommended requirement. They are able to use far less out of video ram sources for the Wii U, the main system the developer is developing this game, for their target audience. They have pushed back the release date by a week to advertise and market the game properly. I  support Zordix AB in their marketing and advertising decision, too few games these days get the proper publicity and marketing needed when they are not made through the famous AAA game studios. My only complaint when it comes to this is, I see a game like this having much more success if released in the summer time when people enjoy the water and feeling of wanting to embrace the cool atmosphere of water parks.      The visuals use bright colors on the water levels with real-life rocks, corals, and true to life piers, sand. Imagine all great water-themed Nintendo 64 games reimagined with new state-of-the-art graphics that complement the year 2016. The splashes of water can be heard when dolphins come up and go underneath the water. Palm trees are lush, clustered together. The soundtrack is filled with relaxing zen music that calms and soothes the soul. Interestingly, it is perfectly aligned with good audio that reminds me fondly of great water; summer themed games on the Nintendo 64.Replayability Length- This game is very replayable with new vehicles to unlock and the higher difficulties of advanced, professional and expert. Overall- 9/10- ExcellentDisclaimer     A review copy of Aqua Moto Racing Utopia was provided by Paul Ryan of Brash Games.			"

Early Access Review
								Hello everybody,let`s have a look at this early access game from ZORDIX AB.AQUA MOTO RACING UTOPIA is an interesting game mix.It feels like WAVE RACE 64 and TONY HAWK SKATEBOARDING had a baby. Why?Thats what i want you to tell.AQUA MOTO RACING UTOPIA, lets call it AMRU from now on, is a Wave Race game.You know this fast Jet Skis they have in every Shark Movie? These are the stars in this game.So, after starting the game you can create a profile and design your own driver. And believe me, there are many possibilitys. From Head to Feet you can choose your clothing and also the form of your Driver Body. You want a Hulk? No problem, get the muscles. Unintendend funny ist the choice of the face, because some really don`t fit well to other Body forms, but after creating our driver and choosing a country flag we are ready for racing.At first, there is a nice tutorial that helps you to master your first steps. The Tutorial shows you how to race and how to make stunts with your Jet Ski. The steerage with the Joypad functions very well and that Jet Ski did all i want, but it took time. Like TONY HAWK SKATEBOARDING you have many button combinations to make some nice stunts.  If you can`t remember the combinations you can call  the Stunt Steering Page each time you want.After mastering the tutorial it is time for some real challenges. You have the choice between  Championship, Free Gaming or Multiplayer  Games. The Championship Gaming is split in a Race and a Stunt Mode. Beat other drivers  and be the first. Before each competition you have to choose your Jet Ski. At the beginning you have a basic Jet Ski but you can collect coins in the Competitions to buy better ones. Like the Boards in TONY HAWK the Jet Skis have a variety of skills like Speed. No you can`t arm them with Kitty Bombs or other weapons. This is a sport game, not a survival game. Completing the Tracks will also open new levels. In the Free Gaming you can create your own challenges or simply do the tracks alone.In the Multiplayer Levels you can have Fun with local friends or online. There are many options like Racing, Freestyle or Party Games like catch the flag or Duck Mom. As you can see AMRU has many, many features to have fun.  I took my time to learn to play with the Jet Ski and i really enjoyed  it. Pro:The Graphics are not like Crysis but very atmospheric. The game catches he enviroment very well. All is very detailled with some nice extras like dolphins. On one card i was in an Alligator Swamp, but there were no alligators. Hey Dev,  simple idea. Go to the Party Game, put some alligators into the swamp und call it survival mode. Well, i think that will get some trouble with the age rating, eh? Okay Bad idea… yes i know its a sport game, not a survival game. :-)Okay, back to the review. The Music fits well into the competitions and i like the Idea of collecting coins to buy better Jet Skis. There are many, many maps and competitions to master and for more impulsion also achivements. Con:The other drivers should be overwork. If you drive into other drivers it feels like you  collide with a wall. They also can push you away but not the other way round. That mean they push you to crash and a crash cost you much time. At the beginning of the the second map is a tunnel and it happened very often that the other drivers push you into the wall. That sink the fun. But hey it is early access and there is much to do.  So, dear Dev, keep up the good work and i`m excited for more things to come.For an early access game it has many Features and  you will have fun.  You should give it a try, also because there are not many games like this out.Enjoy.  "

												This game is simply amazing and quite similar to the old wave race series of games, but with more of everything. Solid gameplay mechanics with the simple concept of driving a jetski or a runabout model watercraft at sea and in canal races. It might be challenging at first, but a lot of fun and very addictive once you get the hang of it. All it brings makes it really stand out in the racing genre as special. Aqua Moto Racing Utopia gives you the option of playing two full blown career modes, a whole single player league full of championships for jetskis and one whole separate league for runabout models. On top of that - a freestyle league where pulling off the coolest stunts on time is all the fashion. There's tons of different maps and tracks that will immediately test your split-second reaction time as well as your tactical skills. While none of the diverse ""exotic"" worlds where the action takes place use their real name it’s obvious which they are. The quality of the sound effects, original music and the voice actors really help make it more entertaining. My best tips:* First make sure you got a great controller, like an Xbox, Steam controller, or similar. * After discovering the quick turn button and all the clever rotation stunt tricks I could do in the air I had a blast! * Use the right stick while you're driving to do stunts in the water. It will load your boost. * Chose wisely among the jetskis to find the right one for each track. * In the duckling mama party game you slow down if you have too many ducklings. Stay cool and steal the other's ducklings just before every 20 second pass when score is added. Then lose your ducklings and steal them back again before the next 20 sec pass. * Try out the first person camera for a truly great sensation of speed, especially in canals. To sum it up, it's like the classic wave race and stunt games combined, into the most addictive racing I've experienced in quite some time.			"

												I agree with Super Phillip, this is probably a Top-10 Game of the Year, for me too. I love arcade racers be it in water, mud or outer space. It's extremely expensive but if you look for competitive water racing it's the best option you have. The content is of high quality and there are lots of championships and other game modes. The realism, in particular the jetskis and how the character leans from side to side, is quite spot on. If you're serious about arcade racing and enjoy the challenges water brings, and you don't mind spending a buck or two, then I can recommend Aqua Moto Racing Utopia.			"

												Just bought Insane, Stunt Mania, and finally this game for some racing game nostalgia. Now this game is very different from the others since it's a water racer. There are ten good looking exotic venues showing off a variety of styles. The waves keep the game fresh and fun as I have to adjust speed and direction all the time to master them. I like the huge amount of tracks and unlockable watercraft of different capabilities, some suited for top speed and some for sharp turns and freestyle competition. This game clearly rivals any ordinary car racer. If you're looking for a hard core racing ride on water, this fantastic game is for you. THE GREAT+ Great offering of serious racing+ Massive number of races+ Massive number of watercraft+ Outstanding water simulation+ Polished and refined gameplay+ Amazing soundtrack+ Online and party games to play with friendsTHE LESS GREAT- Sometimes too agressive competitors- No online leaderboards  "

												I took the plunge! As a long-time fan of the Wave Race series, I recently picked up Aqua Moto Racing Utopia after reading numerous reviews commending how advanced and detailed the water physics are. After just an hour with the arcady simracer I can honestly say that I consider it my go-to racing title. The controls are phenomenal. The soundtrack and settings truly are top notch. Finding new racing lines feels great. The different weather settings are awesome, from rain to sunset. The venues are convincing and well implemented as is the hard boiled AI making little ""mistakes"" here and there, feels very alive. It can definitely give you a run for your money! The engine sounds, doppler effects when you get passed, water noises, etc etc all are very well done overall! I also really appreciate the attention given to the jetski movement in how it responds to the aerodynamics in the air and the forces of the sea, very cool!. Being able to race online with my friends is also a welcome feature. If you want to experience some of the best water physics that racing has to offer I strongly recommend this game.  "

												Hi everyone,It's surprisingly enjoyable in Aqua Moto Racing Utopia to figure out how to tackle the waves with the control stick. And use the other stick to perform stunts, both in the water while driving and in the air. It's great to see some up to date 2017 water graphics, a variety of high end jetskis lined up to chose from and beautiful real world settings. Each setting has custom music playing, which is pretty cool, instead of just one track over n' over.And the best of all is you don't have to be a pro-gamer to have fun with it. You can always try to beat your own records instead of going for the #1 spot. The next championship is unlocked if you are among the top three in the total standings.We played it with some friends, a couple from Australia and I can with deepest warmth recommend the party games. No thumbs up for Aussie beer though.  "

Early Access Review
								This game is more fun than I had expected. Its focus is arcade over sim.-About 9 settings/tracks with some small variations in them. -Some decent waves (you can feel a bit) and they/the water is visually appealing.-Solid controls and stunts for turbo. -I like that you have to brake often (althought its instant like on the road) so are not going full throttle all the time. -They have some jetski upgrades from 2 categories. -Its still in early access too, but no bugs were noticed. I will say that Riptide GP / Renegade is a bit more fun and jetmoto crazy as this is a bit more realistic but not sim. Regardless its a good and rare game worth a few hours.			"

												Its more of a simulation with weak turning. I think its a little too realistic, I was expecting more of an arcade experience. With games like Riptide 2 and Riptide GP: Renegade being such fun and arcade like, this one just feels sluggish to me. Its definitely more realistic than both Riptides, and considering the prices of both Riptides and HydroThunder  in the windows store, this one is a tough sell unless 80% off. Sorry to sound so negative, but it you are like me and love arcade racers, this is just boring. But in the defense of the game, there is no mention of arcade anywhere, so maybe I just have unrealistic expectations.			"

												This game is fun and different from other water racing games I tried before. You race hard against competitive computer-controlled riders and you perform stuns that would break your neck in real life to charge your turbo. The cool part is that waves are formed from the watercraft and you see and feel them which shows the programmers care about details. And there are a bunch of increasingly hard riders to beat. It's still a new game, thus the high price. I was fortunate to get it during a Steam sale a couple of weeks ago. If you like arcade water racing you should get your booty wet too.			"

												Gave this a bash again today after it sitting in my library since early access. Have to say the commitment from the developer has paid off, the updates have improved the game. Issues with the mechanics of the game have been mostly ironed out.Might be a high price point, but if this is you're niche in the world of gaming, it sure is a pretty looking update of those jetski  games from the 90's.

								Omg love the game after the update! Haven't played much on my account but i have played with friends. The waves isn't as bothering anymore and the stunting challanges and stunting in general is much more fun!I recommend you to buy this game!			"

												Skill based games like Aqua Moto Racing Utopia are the best ones. It only took me minutes to pick up the basics and I'm still learning new stuff like cool stunts and better paths around the tracks. The whole game feels very well balanced. Really hard in the later championships just the way I like it. Impressive water effects. It feels like I'm riding on real water. Really good music fitting each venue. Congratulations to an outstanding game! 9/10			"

								Fun little racing game. It's a bit unpolished (early access), but I haven't seen any game breaking issues. If the videos and screen shots makes you interested, you shuld give this a try.			"

												Thanks for a gr8 game! I felt just as happy as my avatar rider's crazy celebration when winning my first cup. Man, I've been looking for a racer like this for ages.  It's soo cool to ride a Jetski. If you're still developing the game, please add some more parkour moments, you know, like more things to jump on and slide on. Thanks!  "

								This game is fun. The physics could be better but game is still early. Handles are good but water physics are lacking (think GTA water physics). Very much like Wave Race 64. It was one of my favorites as a kid. Playing this now sure beats playing Wave Race 64 on a emulator!			"

								I like this game. Im trying to.get my other friends playing it to since it would be a lot of fun to play many friends. I get a funny feeling of playing mariocart but on water. But i have encountered some bugs that needs a fix. But since it is early axcess i can overlook this. But i sometime think that the waves make a little to big of an impact on my steering, it would be better if there where obvious parts with waves and some parts with almost nothing. Today i would rekommend this game, and after some updates i think it will be awsome to ride in the water.One of the best things is the first person mode, thou there is this mode in a lot of other games i have never been playing it on top of water which gives it fast feeling. Would love to play this with an oculus.RegardsEvald			"

												i know i only have a little time 6 attempts, and everyone else likes it . I have to confess more of a simmer and im older than most people here im sure but controlling it is sooo frustrating, i fix boats for a living and accounting for loose arcade feel to be the waves are strange in that instead of just up and down they twist you around and cause loss of aim at last momentr and times out on me    I wish there was a mid choice besides yes or no...I dont recommend			"

												It's actually pretty good. - the graphics and gameplay are solid. When I was abke to find multiplayer, it  seemed good as well. It does have flaws: the sound and  music (and announcer) could be better e.g. there's a seagull sample loop that is just sloppily pasted on the audio canvas; the power-ups and coin pick-ups don't blend with what is a ""semi-realistic"" style - too nintendo 64. There are 3 different career modes - runabout, ski, and freestyle (i.e. tricks) which give it variety .I haven't played it enough to tell whether the maps get repetititive, but overall it's a good game.

												My one big problem with this game is the computer opponents just crash into you and you ALWAYS come off worst...ALWAYS.They just pile into you and knock you off the course. If this was resolved the game would be really good. Wave physics on the jetski isn't at Wave race levels but Nintendo have much bigger budgets to spend on such things.Fix the opponents problem and I'd recommend this all day.this has now been improved but crocodile swamp is still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t with opponents ramming tou into objects that spin you 180 whilst they are unaffected			"

												As someone whom has 6 jetskis standups and sitsown. (Kawasaki 550,650 kawasaki x-2 tigershark 770, Wet-Jet, Wet-Bike and also a hovercraft and ride frequently, i know what it feels like to ride irl. This game has a very similar feel especialy in 1st person view that puts you right behind the bars. A similar feel but easier than actualy riding.  Others have compared this to wave race and its more like wave race 2.0!  Even better and more to do.+great graphics+runs very well on an average to date pc+never gets old (many jetskis to choose from, sitdown and standup, many tracks,  different difficulties, many tricks)+easy to pick up and play +great game to play from a few mins to many hours+couldnt find any bugs+devs r nice and helpful-could use more upgrades but def not needed.I def 111% recomend this to anyone even looking at this game on its steam page. If interested in this game or already own it i would strongly recomend getting the devs other game that is coming out soon similar to this but with snowmobiles! I will def be buying that game as well.64/10 -waverace  =D "
