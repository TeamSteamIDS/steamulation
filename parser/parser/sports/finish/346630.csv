												I got this in a bundle and for the 29 cents US I paid, it was fun.Think of it as a very simple, single entity (dual personality) version of Trine.  Very much so in that the Thief swinging mechanic and the Wizard telekinesis mechanic are extremely similar.  Death is back to the last checkpoint and there are alot of them so the frustration factor is a little lower, despite some tricky spots.  It is shorter than Trine and at times a bit more of a grind, but it is a decent and very underplayed game. At 4.99 it is hard to justify, perhaps 4.5/10, but in a bundle (and it has been 6 times according to Enhanced Steam), it is an easy 7/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												'Plazma Being' is a 2D platformer, it's based on the ability of re-placing the objects and manipulating the enviroment in order to solve the puzzles. Puzzles are good enough, though they are not surprising you when you solve them. They might be pretty easy to solve and it's fun trying to find a way to the solution. However the physics in this game are not so complex and it makes this game kind of dull when it comes together with the generic art syle. Also, it takes time to restart when you fail. I wish there was a faster and easier way to do it.Overall, it's a solid game with a few flaws but definitely worth a playthrough if you enjoy platformers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you want a nice puzzle platformer with some story, not too long, and also you can live with fact that it is an indie game, so graphically not the best (but great mechanics in the game, and gameplay > graphics), also if it is on sale (-75% = 1,25 euros), go for it, you can spend nice 3-4 hours in this game (3,3 hours is my game time, i've completed whole game and also achievements in that time :) but i really love these kind of game, so i have an advantage :) ). Is it hardcore platformer? No, but some parts can be, especially last level, with boss. Is it hardcore puzzle game? Not really, but again, some puzzles can be harder, and you have to work with gravitation and game's physics. Is it worth 5 euros? I think yes, i've enjoyed this game, and the only con is graphics (not really my cons, as i prefer gameplay, not graphics :) ).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
