												A very simple, straight-forward MiniGolf game. The fundementals are not bad, but each hole seems to be a variation on the original hole with some obstacles in the way. I was hoping for something a little more picturesque, or elaborate. Winmills, Some kind of theme to the overall course, anything could have made this a fun game. As such, it felt very repetitious and was overly simple with a hole in one being easy to score on several holes of the first course. Normally, I can find at least a few positive things for a game, but even the music annoyed me to a point, it was like Harvest Moon on repeat, Save your money folks, The PGA games, or even some of the Tiger Woods games offer so much more value for your buck.

												This game rubs me the wrong way in too many places for me to be able to recommend it.  For one, there's only local multiplayer and not online multiplayer.  Next, the camera controls are limited in that you can only change the angle by changing your shot angle.  I would like to be able to zoom around the hole freely so I know what I'm getting into, say, over a hill (which you can't see over from where you're standing).  Also, getting the ball in the hole is referred to as ""pocketing the ball""...is this billiards or golf?  There's also no golf terms like eagle, birdie, bogey, double bogey, etc...it's just Par+0, etc.  This is as basic as miniature golf gets and frankly, it's not enough to justify the price tag.

												Firstly, let me remind you about the lack of online multi player - which they have since edited the store page to indicate this, AFTER I brought it, partly because of that point.Visual ""next"" prompts get annoying too, especially when I'm trying to lower my score to match PAR, even on single player (one to begin the match, another to indicate I'm to play).Graphics are good, but I wouldn't say overwhelming; on a few occasions the graphics glitched out for me and the camera was placed under the map for some reason. 5/10, over par with a bad handicap. Much prefer 3d ultra mini golf, even though it's probably over a decade old.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

One-Sentence SummaryA simplistic, bare-bones minigolf game that suffers from really bad physics, stiff controls, dull gameplay mechanics, numerous bugs, and strange interpretations of minigolf rules and terminology.Pros+ It's a no-frills, straightforward minigolf game (sorta)Cons- The ball moves and feels like a weightless ping-pong ball- The wall deflection angles are really wonky- No camera free-look controls, zoom, or map to plan shots- The swing mechanics are not fun and require no skill- The single music track loops quickly and gets repetetive- ""Par"" for every hole is a hole-in-one!  What?!- Strange boundary mechanic and ball drop rules- Numerous bugs and odd design choicesFinal ThoughtsI've been looking for a nice, straightforward minigolf game without all the wackiness and superflous zany things that usually are often put in to ""spice up"" the core game.  3D MiniGolf, on the surface, looked like it might fit that criteria.  Unfortunately, the terrible ball physics and lack of ability to plan shots really detracts from the experience.  I think a simple two-click swing mechanic could have worked OK in a simple minigolf game like this if the ball physics were at least somewhat realistic, but as it stands it just feels like you are smashing a ping-pong ball around in some alternate universe where momentum and deflection angles do not exist.Additionally, for golf/minigolf enthusiasts, the strange use of terminology and rule interpretations make the game seem like it was programmed by someone who has never actually played a round of golf in their life.  Things like par for every hole being a hole-in-one make it impossible to score below par.  The use of the term ""par +1"" instead of bogey or just flat out a number of strokes.  Strange boundary lines on the actual green which if you don't cross you have to drop your ball again from the start.While I respect the idea and ambition to create a simple, straightforward minigolf game, this one needs a lot of work and refinement in order for it to actually be any fun to play.Suggested AlternativeGolf With Your Friends, also available on Steam, is an excellent alternative for those looking for a simple yet well-made minigolf game.

This is by far the worst minigolf game I've ever played.I spent twice as much time waiting in between holes and shots than I did actually playing the game. When I did get to play, it was monotonous and infuriating.Pros:● NoneCons:● Physics are horrible!● Hole designs are boring.● Aiming is a bit wonky.● Slow loading and obnoxious menus.● BuggyThe physics are downright awful. Good luck figuring out how much power you need to get up a hill or across a slanted platform because the ball will not react how you expect it to. This can cause the levels that aren't just a straight shot to the hole to be immensely infuriating. Sometimes the ball will bounce off something and then start spazzing out, bouncing up and down repeatedly until it comes to a stop.The hole designs are boring. Half of them seem to be straight shots to the hole which make the added obstacles pointless. There are some with ramps and slopes that take a thousand tries before you hit that one lucky shot that works. These are super obnoxious. The rest, while they have a few twists and turns or bounces, are still really boring to look at. The courses have next to no decoration. A lot of holes have unfair pars, so if you're in challenge mode you get restart the level a million times to hit your shot perfectly for that hole-in-one. Some of the holes also reset or move your ball if you don't land your shot in the marked area. There is seemingly no point to this feature.The aiming seemed a bit off. The aiming arrow is really short and practically useless. I swear I always had to aim slightly to the left of where I thought the arrow was actually pointing. Not to mention when the game sets you up for your next shot, half the time it points you in the complete wrong direction and have to slowly turn yourself the correct way.The most obnoxious thing of all though is how much time is wasted not actually playing the game. When you start up a hole, it takes a few seconds to load, then you need to click past a menu that pops up, then you have to watch or click to skip the hole preview, then it tells you it's your turn and you have to click continue again (Even if you're in single player!), all before you finally get to shoot. Then once you shoot, sometimes your ball takes forever to come to a stop and there is no way to skip this. You just have to wait. Then as I said above, sometimes on follow-up shots the game will point you in the wrong direction, further wasting your time. For every hole you get to repeat that process over and over again.Lastly the game is buggy. When I alt+tabbed out of the game I could not get back in. The game would just not come up. It happened multiple times and I had to kill the game through the task manager. One time I went to load up a new tournament and the game just hung on a black screen forcing me again kill it through the task manager. If you try to turn the music off (it's repetitive) by moving the music slider to 0, it does work, but every time you restart the game the music comes back until you go back into the menu and click on the down arrow again. Also, if I hit the hole but the ball bounced out/ringed the cup, half the time the game would play the sound effect like if the ball had gone in. Then of course there was the ball spazzing out, bouncing up and down sometimes as well.I had hoped for the best, but this game was the worst. I've played free Flash golf games that were way better than this. If you're thinking about buying this game, don't waste your money. If you already got this in a bundle or something and are thinking about playing this game, don't waste your time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
