												Cheap copy of Plants vs. Zombies. Probably ported mobile game, running at 720p, no graphical options whatsoever and everything locked nicely at 18 FPS... Don't touch it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Basic InformationTitle:  Battle Ranch: Pigs vs PlantsDeveloper:  PlayboomPublisher:  PlayboomGenre:  CasualGeneral ImpressionAs much as I wanted to find a redeeming point for Battle Ranch, sadly I could not. The interface and graphics seem like a cheap Plants Vs Zombies rip-off and the annoyingly repetitive sounds make it a challenge to play even through one hour. I could not withstand two. It tries to add some tower defence flavoring of its own but fails miserably. Sure, it’s cheap and has Cards and Achivements. I would still have a hard time recommending it since a game has to provide some form of entertainment, right? Not this one…Strong Points+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- Almost copy-pasted gameplay and interface.- Repetitive sounds.Rating 4/10 This review was submitted for SUPER Giveaways.

Cheap clone of Plants and Zombies not worth your money or time2/10 ★★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆A shameful and lazy clone of Plants vs Zombies. In every aspect worse than the original. Nowadays browser games look and feel better.Don't, simply don't! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												PvZ with boars instead of zombies. I run it at 1280x720 in windowed mode and I find the graphical assets to be just fine, they more then get the job done.Yes PvZ is a more polished game but if you are looking for more of the same vs hairy pigs... this is your huckleberry lads!If you're on the fence on this one just wait for a sale, with the card drops it probably pays for itself.

Battle Ranch: Pigs vs Plants is not a terrible (I would say ""poor"" instead) game by any stretch of the imagination, but it provides little unique to add to the Tower Defence formula, not to mention the established kings of the genre. It's cheap so you can give it a try, but do not expect much.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Battle Ranch is basically ""Plants Vs Zombies"" but with a few added perks and a better seeding system. I personaly like the way you grow seeds/collect plants instead of sunlight and you have livestock you may grow/sell.This 1$ game was crashing my 1000$ Video Card...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I do not know many games that tried to emulate and challenge the original master of the line tower defence, Plants vs. Zombies (PvZ). Battle Ranch takes the same basic principle and, frankly, merely does it again. They should have at least made the turrets something else than fruits. Still, there are some differences for its own merit.Every level throws a bunch of different zomb... uh, I mean freaking boar vikings at the ranch and you have to defend it by planting defensive turrets. There are both fast-loading pea shooters and burst turrets with longer reload-times, turrets with slowing capabilities, debuffers and outright defensive plants that block enemy movement or projectiles from hitting your plants. There are single-use items like bear traps and different area-attack bombs all the way to the slowly replenishing banana missile silo. Mobs sometimes drop special single-use items as well. Defences are no real innovation in tower defence but adequate enough.There is a good variety of different enemies from the basic grunt through more enduring varieties to ones with special abilities like flying, fast moving capabilities or tunneling under everything. There are several tanks too. Alas, within these special capabilities the boars do not differ more - every boar of a certain special type looks and behaves always exactly the same way. It would have been nice to see some variation or maybe stronger or weaker types of the specific specialities. However, noting that almost all the game graphics files are plain images, some crazy graphics mods might become available in time.Different from PvZ the six-row field is divided into two separate parts: the garden and the turret field. Field hosts your defensive capabilities while in the garden you play a constant mini-game of planting and harvesting fruit for score that's used to buy turrets. There are 18 different garden plants, one for each turret type. They differ from each other with their reharvesting times and score production rates, and in addition few of them have to be replanted after harvesting. You get a full score (i.e. a star) from a level if you harvest all of the fruits required by the level.One thing that's nice is that you don't have to click every single fruit you harvest - simple slide by the mouse cursor is enough. However, annoyingly enough the frame rate appears to be locked to 15 FPS, resulting in clunky animations. Also, the PC port (Battle Ranch was originally a phone/tablet game) has merely one resolution available, which is a huge oversight. The early levels are also super-easy so I'd wish there was a turbo button to speed things up. That or it should generally be slightly faster paced. Also, you can't redo levels: you have to play through the whole thing again if you miss a star for that season perfection achievement.The story mode has 50 levels divided into five seasons (the regular ones + unpredictable) plus a couple of special levels for each season. The only differences between the regular seasons are the fruits and the obstacles that you have to clear to fill the whole garden: grass, stones, tree stumps and snow are just reskins of the same stuff, as are the ""tools"" required to clear/harvest them. In the unpredictable season and bonus levels between stages some special effects can affect the garden and your plants, like rain grows more grass to block the garden (minor annoyance) or localized tornados destroy plants in random locations. Unpredictable season is clearly the most challenging (and suitably, the last one) of the otherwise easy story seasons.After story you can hurl yourself into the bonus games and mini games: there's a pure gardening mode and a long defence mode with several stages of enemies with the same fruit defenders. It's a shame there were often just one or two levels of the more intriguing mini games like the one where the field is filled with treasure chests, each one containing either a boar or a weapon to use againts them, a click opening the surprise. Myself, I found the puzzle levels of Boarmania the most interesting, for in those the roles are reversed: you are given a set amount of boars and you have to destroy the gardens behind rows of defensive plants. There were 15 levels of these but I wouldn't have minded having more.Like any farming game, this one also has a silly garden for you to waste hours with. Any garden plants can be planted there with a set fee and you'll get some money for the plants thus harvested. This is probably the most viable way to get the two grindy achievements (get 1 million dollars and harvest 100000 fruits). Fortunately, you can hire a slow-walking but tireless farming gnome to do the harvesting for you and let the game run on the background while you play something else. Nevertheless, it's still going to take a lot of time if you want them. I've effectively AFKed some 50 hours of my game time and silently grinded the fruits in the background while actually hacking away at knights or ruling vast kingdoms elsewhere. Oh, and there's also a barn with potential (and quite expensive) cows and chickens and stuff but I figured it was a waste of grinding time to grow chow for animals (unintentional shout-out to vegetarianism).In effect, there's about 30 hours of real playing involved. I'd call it Above Average and in my opinion it's worth its list price of 7 euros especially if you loved PvZ, maybe about half that if tower defence still tickles your fun bones. The oversights in porting it to PC dull the outlook, though the devs have said they are at least looking into the resolution matter. Modding might make it more interesting even though there's no Steam Workshop at the time or (AFAIK) planned out.If you're sceptical whether you'd like it, there's a demo on the game's Steam Store Page. Initially I tried it and was satisfied to buy it at launch, but it's also a good way to see whether you can put up with the resolution, clunky animations and the similarities to PvZ. It's convenient that you can continue the full version from where you were left in the demo.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
