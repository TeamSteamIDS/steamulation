												Poker Night at the Inventory is a Poker game made by Telltale Games. It is available for €4 and is worth a lot more than that. Poker Night at the Inventory allows you to play Texas Hold'em with Max, Strong Bad, Tycho and the Heavy.So what is this game all about? Well, you play as 'The Player' and you play Texas Hold'em with 4 pretty well-known game characters. A Characters will sometimes use an item to play. If you beat that character, you will get that item in Team Fortress 2! While you're playing the characters will discuss about life, underwear and other kinds of useless crap. Call, Fold or Raise, and try to beat them all!Verdict--------This game offers a lot of fun for just €4. It has beautiful cinematic graphics, features 4 famous game characters and allows you to play poker without spending more than €5! Do I need to explain this any further? Just buy the freakin' game!This game will keep you in the Inventory for at least 25 hours. If you want all unlockable items you can be found at the Inventory for 50 hours.Score: 81/100			",191,22,2,31,5,3,16

												A decent hold'em poker game, where you can win four items of Team Fortress 2 game (which is not of any interest for me) and listen a hilarious in-game chat of 4 fun characters: Max from Sam & Max series, Strong Bad from Homestar runner, Heavy from already named Tea Fortress and Tycho from Penny-Arcade(dotcom). All of them are lovable. It could be very relaxing, dealing cards, and listen idle, yet clever chat of those four. For some time, at least.Game have only one downside: once you heard all the lines characters were going to say... and win all 4 items from them... it is getting bleaker. Losing colours and taste. And if you're an achievement hunter... well, I wish you the best of luck. Achievements in the Poker Night are very logical and good ones, but some of them are connected to winning the hand with certain combination. And yeah, to made complete of this game, you need to get a straight flash.Well, again, good sides:1) Proper, enjoying poker. If you set difficult level at hard, it will be quite challenging. No, you'll not win every hand with all-in tactic, like some other reviews said. You gotta try to be a good player. A cool and smart one.2) Not only you'll be playing poker with worthy opponents, but they'll be entertaining you in the process! And every of them has a different behavior, which you'll need to learn for make sure you're winning.3) From those of us who are playing Team Fortress, the items you'll win should be a good reward to play a night or two in poker.Bad sides:1) No matter how clever and fun are the lines from all four your opponents, they are limited. And after you heard them all, in all combinations... it is not so fun anymore. And even beyond that point, sometimes, there are lines which feels out of order. Like when Heavy guy is folding cards before you, and then starting to banter you with something like ""In Mother Russia you're quit when you're dead"". C'mon, man, you're folded too!2) So the game wears off... but if you want it with complete achievements, you need damned staright flush! And that's a bummer. Chances to get that combination... not high.3) Finally, there are some stabilty issues, especially when you're trying to change skins of background. So after several attempts to change something, I decided to stick to the main theme, the reason of stability.I have two marks: ""Khorosho!"" (8/10) if you are playing for the items and not for long. And 7/10 - if you're collecting achievements and getting bored with all those repeating lines again and again.			",725,237,45,155,101,5,232

												+ Visually appealing+ Funny dialogue, but gets repetative after a while+ Unlocks add incentive to play- Predictable AI is too easyEver wanted to listen to some of your favorite video game and internet characters say kinda funny things to each other while you play a basic poker game? Maybe? Well maybe you should give Poker Night at the Inventory a try. Naturally, the addition of character antics slows the game down quite a bit, so if you want to really play poker, this game will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. Additionally, the character AI is very predictable after you've played for a bit. Tycho is conservative, Heavy is aggressive, Strong Bad likes to bluff, and Max is aggressive to the point of stupidity. Once you learn their tendencies and tells, the game becomes very easy.It's fun for a while, a nice game to relax with while enjoying an adult beverage. By the time you unlock most of the stuff, though, you'll probably be bored of it. Good thing they made another one!73/100A great poker game for people who don't really play poker. Worth about 2 bucks at this point.			",122,58,1,25,15,5,23

												Too bad tf2 items are the main reason many people are buying this game and, what's worse, most of these people don't even play it, they use cheats to unlock achievements to get their tf2 items.This game is surely entertaining even if you don't play tf2 and if you don't know any of these characters.Their dialogues and voice comments are still pretty funny and poker overall is pretty interesting game, of course if you bother to learn at least the basics of it before you start playing.Even losing in this game feels good, it's just a friendly game with interesting characters where there are fake money at stake.Better use this instead of gambling your real money, you know.And use the saved money to buy more tf2 items.Requested: list of tf2 items you can get from this game.[wiki.teamfortress.com] ",1322,536,38,187,137,11,206

												If you're looking for some long story about how Sam, Tycho, the Heavy and Strong Bad all ended up playing poker ... well, there's not much of one. It's just the four of them hanging out and playing at The Inventory, an underground club that supposedly has its roots in Prohibiton, but offers nothing more than a setting. And that's fine, because really, this game doesn't have a need for a story. Visually, Poker Night's a good looking game. The Heavy, Strong Bad and Max all use models from Valve and Telltale's games, respectively, and their animations are very smooth. Tycho's model, on the other hand, is brand-new, and oddly enough, he's the one who looks a little out of place from time to time. There's also a few graphical glitches if you move the game along too fast: in one instance, I couldn't see my cards for an entire hand because they never actually loaded. I'd folded too quickly and skipped to the end of the hand before the game could make the change, it seems. Another cool little feature is that in the background, the characters will appear as you knock them out of the game. They don't do a whole lot, but it's kind of cool to see Strong Bad playing the arcade machine, or the Heavy at the bar after a bitter defeat at the table.Where Poker Night excels, though, is in the chatter at the table between the Heavy, Tycho, Strong Bad and Max. The scritping and the actual voice acting itself is spot-on, a testament to the abilities of whoever's responsible at Telltale for writing this game's dialogue. Tycho's voice is a bit jarring at first, but you get used to it the more you play, until it seems natural. What's also great is that each character's quirks are also included in their dialogue: for example, there are Heavy's ""funny"" stories about summer camp that are actually quite morbid, and Tycho's obsession/lust over giraffes makes it into the game, the latter of which made me laugh out loud the first time I heard it. In short, they've nailed the spirit of all four characters perfectly. My only complaint is that they engage each other, but never really bring the player into their conversations. You kind of feel more like an invisible observer than a player at the table with these guys for the bulk of the experience. Outside of their clever quips, the actual computer players seem... well, I'm not sure how to describe them. Maybe a bit erratic? At times, they seem to take unnecessarily big risks or make strange plays, like going almost all in and folding. At other times, the AI seems to know exactly what the flop, turn and river cards are going to be ahead of time, and is able to make strong bets based on that knowledge. I know part of poker is that the game can turn on its head with the draw of the right card and make a winning hand a losing one. But in Poker Night, it feels like those sudden moments are, at times, manufactured by the game more than they would occur naturally. Poker Night's gameplay pretty much boils down to good ol' fashioned Texas Hold 'Em, the kind you see on TV. It helps a bit if you know what beats what ahead of playing this game, as it makes it easier to gamble, but you can definitely pick up how to play over time. Navigating the in-game interface to make calls, raises and folds is relatively simple. Plus, in addition to the new items, winning games unlocks new tables and decks to play with, giving you the opportunity to customize the game's look a little bit.On the downside, there's not a whole lot else you can change. The AI has two difficulty options - normal and hard - and you can adjust the level of conversation that goes on as well as if it’s censored or not. But you can’t change anything about how much the buy-in is, presumably to keep people from somehow gaming the system to get the Team Fortress 2 items easily, what blinds start at, etc. Maybe adding in a few other options that unlocked once you had all of the items would have helped keep some replay value. All this boils down to Poker Night's biggest problem: it gets repetitive very quickly. Once you've heard Tycho and Heavy's tenth Class discussion for the twentieth time, it loses a lot of its initial charm. On top of that, with no real options to modify the game's stakes, you're always playing the same $10,000 buy-in game once you have the new Team Fortress 2 items. Thankfully, Telltale's included the option to right click through any conversation as a means of speeding up the game's pace and perhaps saving your sanity. The only bad part, of course, is right-clicking takes a lot of the fun out of the game because you're not getting those interactions anymore. In the end, for 4,99€, you can’t really go wrong, and this game delivers way more than the typical ultra-budget title. On top of all of the TF2 enhancements, you get the added fun of seeing some great characters in a funny setting. It's fun, it's cheap, and it gets you Team Fortress 2 upgrades while letting you play poker against a bunch of fun characters. It's a good game, even if you don't play TF2. The controls arent great and the poker isn't the best, but it's still a blast.			",2254,865,87,235,310,22,348

												Enjoyable as almost every other poker game, but not only that! With added features, including gameplay based reactions and story based informative conversations between your playmates-characters from other well known games, Poker Night at The Inventory genuily creates a feeling of a poker tournament played with your friend as if you were really there.You will hear a few entertaining and interesting dialogues at The Inventory club, sadly a lot not so interesting or exciting ones. After a while I clicked through the most of them just to let the game continue. Althought there are some precious and fitting ones. My favourite is this one said by Tycho, because I'm Czech and its nice to see we are not totally unknown to the world ""Checking is lame. Unless you are Czech.

Whether you're looking for a review made in 1 paragragh or in a multitude of them, I hope you enjoy the review(s).Moving along...I decided to do a small review on Poker Night @ the Inventory. It's a simple concept made for a simple video game based on a (simple on paper) complex card game called Poker which everyone probably knows.If you don't... well... shame on you, because it's really f*ckin' fun! (Avoid real money bets though, there's a high chance you'll lose your car, dog, wife, house or kids with all the betting and stuff...)Anyways, Poker is nicely recreated in this video game format... mostly.You play against popular video game franchise characters, naming Max (from the Sam and Max series), Strong Bad (I have no idea), Heavy Weapons Guy (from TF2) and that's it...The dialogue is well done, it's funny at times and it keeps the mood going without boring you. The fact that the AI is solid for the most part also helps a lot. However, after a couple of hours, the dialogue WILL repeat itself over and over, making you skip it constantly after 3 hours of play, which isn't very good, as you can probably tell.The gameplay is basic poker, you got your flushes, straights (and hom... bad joke, sorry), full houses (which you won't have if you play on casinos, more like ""empty houses"" hahaha, get it?! God, what's wrong with me?), two-pairs, your classic ""poker"" and more...Everything plays as it should... like a poker game...There is one thing lacking though... and that is the possibility to bluff.You can bluff, sure. I mean I did go ""All-In"" when everything I had was a ""pair of twos"" or an ""Ace-High"" and all the AI ended up folding. Bunch of chicken ♥♥♥♥♥...Anyways, it felt like luck more than anything else, bluffing is supposed to make you feel good, you can trick people into thinking you have a full poker of Aces when in fact, you only possess a joker and a Magic: The Gathering card. Where do you think the expression ""Poker Face"" comes from? Exactly...The lack of a bluff system (which no poker video game can ever do, I think... maybe ""Next-Gen"" can fix that, LOL!) takes away a bit of the strategy of the game. However, it's enough to make the game fun enough to play, to listen to the characters talk (Heavy and Max are awesome, Strong Bad came to me as annoying) and to generally, have a good time!And I had indeed, a good time! Even the luck felt PERFECTLY balanced to either f*ck me, or f*ck one (or more) of the opponents, not too unfair or fair for me. I actually remember ending up the very first round of the match going All-In alongside 2 other characters, which was hilarious!********************************TL;DR**************************************I'm dragging a bit here, so, sorry. Anyways, funny dialogue that can get repetitive after a while (but that's expected), nicely balanced luck (in my case), basic poker gameplay, nothing special to talk about the gameplay. And finally, you get TF2 stuff! Only problems I had were related to frustrating luck (some matches in a row just weren't clicking for me) and the lack of bluffing (quite impossible in video game format). OH! AND NO MULTIPLAYER!!!! WTF, TELLTALE?!So overall, I had fun. The game costs (only) 3,99€, on sale, you can get it for 0,99€ or even less! It's a perfect game to spend your time in work breaks (lengthier matches won't last more than ~45 minutes (and even that's pushing it!)).The obligatory gaming industry scoring system for Poker Night @ the Inventory is an arbitrarily pointless 8/10.Small review my♥♥♥♥♥ Ugh!

""I AM SORRY. I DO NOT HAVE THIS MONEY... I DID, BUT SASHA HAS BEEN VERY GOOD LATELY, AND I WANTED TO GET HER GIFTS. THE MONEY IS GONE. I HAVE NO CHOICE...""Telltale Games - these dudes got it in their name. They're able to put some kind of story even into the poker based game. Isn't that awesome? Instead of basic poker game with just table and cards on table, no dialogues, annoying dealer and just that feeling when the only thing you are focusing on are the cards, Poker Night at the Inventory make you feel that you're really part of the game, part of the table and fellas around you are ""real"". Graphics are just awesome, dialogues are very very very-well written, your company is well-choosen. Most probably it'll get repetetive after 100/200 hands but when you play for special items, it really freshen up the gameplay. Dialogues are also very repetetive after while, but they are so great, that possibility it gets annoying for you is very low.After few hours in, when you win all the items, and fully enjoy it and all you want to to before uninstalling the game is 100% achievements, the fact that few of them are luck based really ruin the day for you. Getting Straight Flush or Quads is really rare. Me myself, I got Quads twice and Straight Flush once. It's random algorithm so some of you may get Straight Flush even at the start of your very first hand.This game cost 4,99 dollars, during sale 0,99. If we take into consideration, what kind of stupid and bad games are there available for way more than that, 0,99 is absolutely nothing and don't even think twice about it. Same goes with Poker Night at the Inventory 2.However, Governor of Poker 2 is better game for me, as it was that thing which brought me into real-life and online poker. Hopefully I'll do review for GoP2 soon, and I fully recommend you those three games if you're fan of poker!Bonus Point: Strong BadRating: 7/10 ",105,13,6,7,13,1,6

												I am recommending this game solely for the humor between the various characters in it - they are, for the most part, witty and original, and their nicknames for eachother are great (Heavy calls Strongbad ""Tiny Heavy"", during some great moments). The only character I was very whatever about was Tycho, he comes off as a pompous annoying know-it-all, but it only gives the others an opportunity to crack wise at his expense. The actual gamepay should be simple enough right? No. The poker mechanics are horrendous. On occassion you will find that a pair of whatevers will beat a flush, or any other weird combination. The actual gameplay has been riddled with bugs like this since release, and that was several years ago. This is the major downside to this game, but the humor completely makes it worth it nonetheless.Another minor downside, if you can even call it that, is that the achievements are moronic. One achievement asks you to get a straight flush, the probability of getting that in Texas Hold 'Em ""is approximately 0.0311% (0.0032% for royal flush and 0.0279% for non-royal straight flush)"". Other such achievements include ""Get a hand with 3 kings"", ""Get 4 of a kind"", and so on. While sure, getting these cards would be quite an achievement, it is still a major nuisance if it is the only achievement you lack from having 100% of the achievements - even for someone (like myself) who does not strive for 100%'ing achievements, lacking that ONE achievement would make anyone want to go for it.Nonetheless, game is recommended still, it is very funny and witty, and makes for a great pastime.

Everything is better with a group of friends!Everyone knows doing pretty much anything feels more fun with a group of frineds, or even just with fun and friendly people. And that's how Poker Night at the Inventory feels like!The players in Poker Night at the Inventory may not be the most friendly ones but they certainly are fun to listen to. You are placed in a poker table with Max from Sam & max, Heavy from Team Fortress 2, Tycho from Penny Arcade and Strong Bads from Homestar Runner. If you are familiar with these names you may notice that they aren't the most friendly faces but that doesn't mean it'd be annoying or unfun to listen to them while they're babbling about random stuff.Aside from the funny dialogue theres not much going on with the game. It's Texas Hold'em with colorful characters and neat graphics. It's basic yet fun. If you are fan of Texas Hold'em and video games you will most likely enjoy this game.One of the main selling points for this game are the rewards your opponents can place as a bet if they don't have enough cash with them. If you win them in a hand and they run out of cash you will get rewarded with their unique item they just bet in. You will be awarded with an Achievement and an in-game item for Team Fortress 2. If you are not a fan of Team Fortress 2 the rewards will be quite useless.Poker Night at the Inventory is a fine game. It may not be the most polished one but it holds up as a Texas Hold'em game very well. It has unique style and fun characters and is a game that feels fun to jump into a match of Hold'em while listening to them talk. If you get annoyed of them or you've heard all of their jokes million times you can always mute them. So if you are looking for a solid Texas Hold'em game with some chracter this is just the right game for you. Although if you are not familiar with video game culture you may not understand any of the jokes since they pretty much revolve around the characters and their universes.For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!

Even though I think I've heard most of the dialouges between characters several times, it is still entertaining to listen to them chat, and their gasps and faces of shock when you go all in is also funny.

												So, Poker Night At The Inventory, the game where you play Texas Hold'em with a rabbit, 2 out-of-the-ordinary people, and... whatever the hell Strong Bad isSeriously though, this game is amazing, I absolutely love it.I assume the majority of us got this game for the tf2 items. If you are one of those people, or you're a fan of Sam & Max,  Homestar Runner, the Penny Arcade webcomics, or a poker player in general, I'd recommend this game to you in a heartbeat.The story is as simple as who you play as: you are known as ""The Player"", a silent poker player who's arrived at the inventory to play poker with 4 other fellows. The Inventory is a secret poker place hidden from society in case those ""in charge"" decide to essentially ban Poker for a second time.There you have it, that's the story: Nothing more, nothing less is known about you; the rest is playing some number of games of Texas Hold'em with the Heavy (tf2), Sam (Sam & Max), Strong Bad (Homestar Runner), and Tycho (Penny Arcade webcomics) for stakes of $10k.Now onto the aspects of the game:Graphics [9/10] - The graphics are their own personality, likewise the characters' models match their respective traitsAssets [7.8/10] - I run a fairly average computer with a lot of memory left, yet I run at somewhere between 30-40 fps ingameAI [9.8/10] - The ai of the game is, I feel, unbelievably realisticSoundtrack [10/10] - The soundtrack is stupendous, I love it: I listen to this whenever I need think music playingAtmosphere [10/10] - Between the soundtrack, the dialouge from the characters, the game looks and feels amazing and almost believable to be sitting down playing poker with these charactersOverall score [8.7/10] - The big killer for me was the fact that the second game runs much more smoother, despite having more stuff going on: other than that, this game would've gottten a 9.6/10			",31,4,0,1,4,2,3

												If you enjoy poker, casual gaming and good company then this game is worth every penny and more.The game in its basic form is just Texas Hold'em poker, easy to play and clean layout.  However there are many achievements to unlock, items to collect and even free unlocks for Team Fortress 2.The witty dialogue between your opponants gives you immersion into their world and the background music, which I enjoy immensely, comforts you at the table.I've owned this game for many years and I still pop back for a round of cards with these chumps.  So grab a drink and join the fun at the Inventory club.			",22,6,0,11,23,2,8

												If you're buying it for the character roster, get it- Listening to conversations about whether or not Max shtupt Mama Boscow or Heavy trying to get Strong Bad to join RED team is really enjoyable.If you're buying it for the TF2 items, get it*- As far as I know the weapons you can get from this game have been patched so that they are untradable. This is the only way to get them (but bare in mind you'll actually have play the game to earn them).* [ Don't take my word for it though. If you're a trader I wouldn't bother.]If you're buying it for the poker, don't bother-As far as I can tell, there are WAY better poker games on steam (quite a few I've seen that are worth less) so if you want to play poker, get one of those instead.That's my view of the game, but you should probably check some other reviews first. My experience of the game is pretty limited, so you might to look at some reviews that are better than mine (which is all of them). There. I've shut up now. Thanks for reading			",15,2,0,0,2,1,1

												Poker Night at the Inventory is a fun distraction, but I felt the only reason I had any emotional investment in it is that I wanted to win the Team Fortress 2 items which are only available through this game. This made me ask myself ""If I don't buy items in TF2, why did I buy this game to get some TF2 items?"" I suppose the answer is that I get to play a game in the process of obtaining those items, but the AI seems much too random in betting patterns to provide a truly enjoyable poker experience. Which means you are really just working to earn those TF2 items; and on top of that you have to pay money just for the privilege to work for them. I'd say buy this if you want to win the TF2 items, but if it's poker you're after there's surely better games out there. Or better yet just grab a real deck of cards and host your own poker night with your mates. 3 out of 10, would not bet.			",507,127,7,26,23,2,37

												It's a freaking poker game. How can it not be more straight forward than that. The side conversations and the unlocks are nice. As it stands however. The game isn't all that great. For three simple reasons1) Facing the same characters over and over again. No multiplayer. And no ""DLC"" or ""extra content"" where you can switch out the other characters for brand new faces. While it is nice to hear the side conversations. It can get pretty old. Pretty fast.2) Luck. Now while this may sound dumb and stupid. There are instances where you might have a lousy hand, but! In some odd concidence you won. Outta nowhere! Where as the other card players could've easily beaten you. Now this might be a game mechanic or just sheer dumb luck. Whatever the case maybe this shouldn't be a thing.3) Weird A.I. Now, if this was against other players then the game might be more fun. But the A.I. in this game is weird, For example, and depending upon how lucky you are when you start a new tournament. The other card players might go all in. Outta nowhere! Which means if you got a great hand than the other opponents. You might actually win the game right away with no real sense of tension OR knock out half of the competition before the game can really progress anywhere.In the end Poker Night is a perfect game for Poker fans and achievement hunters. Yes, this game does have a tutorial and a cheat sheet to understand the 'card hands' and whatnot. But like what I stated; luck really runs the show in the game. If not then the weird A.I. does. If your an achievement hunter and a poker fan. This game might be up your alley. But for anyone else, you might want to pass.			",95,27,0,34,11,4,25

												This game will get you sunglasses in TF2 so that's why most people bought it. It's a fun poker simulator that I enjoyed. You can bluff pretty easily is my only gripe. I like hearing the stories of the characters too, even if they're repeated. But let's be real, that's the only reason you'd buy this--there are free Poker Simulators with better AI than this that you can find easily online. But this one has some love to it simply because of the characters.			",230,51,8,20,20,5,34

												A grand poker game featuring some great characters and hilarious (though crude) dialogue. As far as card games and gambling games go, I grew up on Hoyle Casino. This is much less serious, but I find that I actually enjoy it more for a short pickup game here and there.The game isn't exactly overflowing with content, achievements or deep progression but it also does not require an overflowing wallet to pick up.If you sometimes enjoy kicking back for 20-30 minutes and just playing an amusing round of Texas Hold'em then I would definitely consider adding this to your Steam Library!

												everybody loves gambling but no one wants to lose money, oh wait a sec. this game is for people who either know how to gamble and like it or people who want to learn how to gamble. In Poker night at the inventory you play the game texas holdem (gambling isnt poker poker is a seprate game so the name makes no sense) texas holdem is probably the simplest gambling game I know of, each player gets 2 cards and who ever gets the highest card combo wins. the charecters in this game is Strong bad who is by far the most ""up him self"" funny, Max, well I love max, I remember me and my friend playing sam and max save christmas together, it was challenging, hillarious and really run, tycho, I don't really know much about him so I cant quite say much about him, The Heavy, oh my god this beast of a man made it in to a underground cassino (how the hell?) this guy is off tf2, if you don't know what tf2, you are missing a big piece of your life. to conclude this review I would reccomend this game to as I said before: people who want to learn how to gamble and people who like playing gambling games. (a idea for poker night at the inventory pt.3 is please, please put in a multi player function)			",29,2,1,1,4,2,0

It's like saying the game is Windows-compatible, as long as you're on Vista or older.Only wasted a quid, thankfully.

AUDIOHilariousVISUALCobbled TogetherDIFFICULTYAverageVIBERelaxingCRAVINGPokerON SALEFrequentlyPROS: TF2 items seem to be the main reason many even bother with this, but it's a fun game on its own. Lots of deck and table options, some with cool on-screen effects. Bantering between characters is funny, it's interesting to watch this motley crew come together under one roof. CONS: Weirdly laggy during the beginning intro and generally not well optimized. No display for your current hand means a potential win may slip by. There is no way to completely silence the characters, making their more long-winded checks and folds annoying (especially after a long time playing.) Texas Hold 'Em only?? Where's seven-card stud!WORTH: As the best Poker game on steam currently, I believe this game is worth full-price. If you play TF2, you're going to get items for it, to boot!OVERALL: It's a shame people are brute-forcing this game for TF2 items and uninstalling.  You knuckle-draggers might've looked a little more distinguished after a few games of Poker. Like a monkey in a hat. Nevertheless, if you are having trouble getting all the items and achievements for this game, I have a comprehensive guide you can check out!SCORE:7/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon ",309,150,6,54,38,3,41

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine Poker Night at the Inventory is a game developed and published by Telltale GamesThe game is visually appealing however there were some frame rate drops here and there sometimes. The game offers some funny dialogue but can get repetative after a while and the unlocks add incentive to continue playing the gameOne major flaw in Poker Night at the Inventory is the very predictable AI which makes the game too easyIt's fun for a while, a nice game to relax with while enjoying an adult beverage. By the time you unlock most of the stuff, though, you'll probably be bored of itPoker Night at the Inventory is a great poker game for people who don't really play poker RECOMMENDED :)  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Much like my experience with Poker Night 2 I freely admit that I didn't have a lot of familiarity with the characters. I don't read Homestar Runner, Penny Arcade, or Sam & Max, and I don't play Team Fortress 2. Still, I feel like I've gotten to know all of them a little bit better through their table banter.Seems like it's become my pattern to play sequels before playing the first installments of any series. The absence of a dealer character in this game is jarring after coming from GLaDos, plus the purely cosmetic effects of Table and Deck themed skins felt a little light.Fun game but I must once again make a note of my hatred of luck-based Achievements. I need a Four of A Kind and a Straight Flush for my last two Achievements and it really sucks.			",368,121,4,38,24,4,56

												It's good I guess. I played Poker Night 2 first and I felt bit spoiled here. You play with half the money then the sequel but you get to play with new characters at the same cost as the sequel. You play with Tyron (whoever the ♥♥♥♥ he is), The Heavy (Or Heavy Weapons Guy), Max and Strong Bad with the owner being the dealer which made me miss Glados as the dealer. I just miss her little insults she would make at you but to make up for it, it has a more friendly astmosphere to it. Instead of having Ash and Claptrap having a passive agressive talk with each other, You got The Heavy having a friendly talk with Max about his childhood which I like because it feels less compative and more a friendly match but with this, you get a lot more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.This game is more unfair to you since I somehow got a flush which then gets beat by someone getting a royal flush out of  ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere and when you finally got some money, its very little. I mean, I won a match with a royal flush and get $900 from the main pot while THE ♥♥♥♥ING HEAVY GETS $380000 FROM THE ♥♥♥♥ING SIDE POT WITH A PAIR OF 2s. THAT IS JUST SO MUCH ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T. You can change the difficulty which is a ♥♥♥♥ing lie since you are stuck to normal and you can't change jackshit. You can change the table conversations which yet again does jackshit and you have to turn on the strong langauge which is just so stupid. Hey Telltale, I'm playing Poker by myself in my room. I highly doubt I'm a 8 year old who can buy stuff from steam by myself.There is more to talk about but it's just more whining. I only recommend this if you like Poker Night 2 and want to see the characters and here more lines or want the poker version of Dark Souls.			",51,2,0,4,1,2,0

												Here's my review for Poker night at the inventory.Let's begin shall weWell honestly not much to say about a game like this, its just mainly poker as the name suggests but with a few extras here and there.Gameplay wise its very well placed you are first welcomed with a nice introduction. Then the real game begins but its just poker as we know not much to say here but fully perfect at what it does.It is really addicting though now it makes me wanna play poker in real.Graphical options are many. On low still look pretty  considerable.Sound track well luckily its very good and catchy as well, makes poker fun in another way.Characters well some interesting one's here. you have heavy from (teamfortress 2) obviously. Max (the bunny) from sam and max. Strong bad from what i dont even know of actually. Lastly tycho from a comic or something.Now having all those characters really makes it into a interesting game, sometimes heavy tells you a story (though mostly hes sad awww). Max well the most least serious and mindless character here as when any of the other characters lose they always show angry faces while sam hes always cool. Strong bad well this is one angry fcker. And tycho well best way to describe him would be to say he always folds unless he has a very good set thus making it most harder to beat him.Promotional tf2 (teamfortress 2) and Borderlands 2 in-game items. A neat addition.Over all worth it?Surely if you are interested in a poker game at all this is worth a try. Good for tf2 items if you wanna get it alone just for that. A recommend game at only a price of $4.99 dollars fully worth its value.A poker game as the name suggests, well paced, polished,great ost,nice presentation and good graphics for its genre.===================================================================Click me and follow us as Curator ",167,22,8,12,13,2,29

												Cons:-Could have done so much more with the game to build off of a great themed poker idea to keep players entertained, unboard and replayability. -Got boring after the 5th tournament.  Same thing over and over and nothing new other than winning 4 in-game items that only TF2 new players would want as they have no items of real value to put into their slots.-Conversation settings need to be turned on High in the Options menu to get the most & best conversations in the game.Pros:-Cards randomization feels fairly accurate to real-life, something that almost all video games & poker sites stuggle with.-Cool poker themed game with a 'Rounder's NYC Feel.-With the conversation settings turned on high, surprisingly there are a lot of conversations where I didn't feel bored or even heard the same conversation twice in a full gaming session, and surprisingly colorful stories that was unexpected.-Has a nice optimization & action mechanics that's welcomed.-I waited a year until it went on a real sale and purchased it for $.80 cents for I & II.  Being 30 years old growing up during the arcade days, we spent like $10-$20 a day where that kind of money actually meant something of value, just on quarters in order to play 1 round on a arcade machine.  So I look at it as fair entertainment value for my money, even if i'll only play it once or twice in my life.  I knew this before purchasing it and decided to purchase it for the experience to see what it was all about and to say to myself I played it.If u get it on an amazing $1 sale then feel free to pick it up for the exp, but you can also pass on this game and not miss out on anything in this current gaming era.★★☆☆☆ Mediocre Game - 2/5 Stars			",504,255,7,92,37,4,88

												I don't have much time playing this, but whenever I do boot it up it never ceases to be worth my time. Out of all the games, I guess that Poker Night is what puts me through a rollercoast of emotions the most. I get bummed out, I get super happy, I start getting cocky and then I am reminded of my humbleness by Heavy and his horseapple hand.What I most like about this game is that it has some things that few single-player poker games have: different AIs and bluffs. If you pay enough attention, you can figure out the different playstyles of your opponents, whether the hand is good or not for them and even if they are bluffing.And like every poker game, a lot of weird stuff happens here too. For example, this last tournament I was in: one of the hands consisted in a flush. On the table. Everybody gets a flush. YOU get a flush! And YOU get a flush!But I had the ace so I won the hand. On the same tournament, it was down to me and Max. Max had 500 dollars. I won with an ace high.Insane things like these is what makes Poker Night at the Inventory a remarkable card game, and if you love yourself some poker and you do not have the money to splurge on actual tournaments, I sincerely reccomend this to you. I bought it a couple of summer sales ago along with its sequel and ""Papers, Please"" for the grand total of 20 reais (about 10 dollars). Even if it's not summer sale, I'd say this game is worth its price.Some things that do upset me a little are the little sound bugs here and there, and sometimes it does freeze as if it is thinking. Also the mouse sensibility is stupendously weird and no matter how much I fiddle with the settings I can't get it to work normally. I guess my mouse will be drunk forever whenever I'm playing this game.Also, the subtitles censor the word t w a t. I don't find that upsetting, I just find it unnecessary.			",31,7,0,5,5,2,1

												I will be brief. ""Poker Night"" is the kind of game you just wanna enjoy sitting back and playing. Sure it's unpleasant at times if these opponents pull a fast one on you and somehow come out on top with that River card out of nowhere, but other than having variable luck (mainly against your favor), it's a pretty fun game. Besides, there are times where the cards may go in your favor making your all-in bet not such a bad thing after all. There's amazingly cool graphics and wonderful dialogue to help add to the fun atmosphere. And the storyline behind this game is admittedly well-thought out.If you're a card gamer that enjoys some good Texas Hold 'Em, or if you're a guy who just loves to laugh along with some crazy, witty one-liners from pretty well-known gaming/comic/television celebrities, this game may be right up your alley. Or should I say right up your winning hand? :P			",8,2,0,0,0,1,0

												Words cannot express how much hype I had when I first saw the trailer for this. All of the characters (except for Tycho, who I was honestly unfamiliar with at the time) together was just something so hard for me to process. I also somehow didn't expect it to actually be a poker game before release, so I had to learn it.Thankfully this game is pretty easy to handle once you get the feel for it. I think most sales honestly came from TF2, where you get some unlocks from this game. But I honestly find myself revisiting this every now and then just to hear all the characters talk to each other. Especially Strong Bad and Heavy, like TF2 and Homestar Runner together was a huge thing for me. Almost disappointing all classes couldn't wear the Dangeresque shades, but I still wore them proudly.Actually diving into it. Of course all the characters are amazing, granted you recognize them all. And it provides for some  amazing talk between them all (and you will eventually hear all the lines if you play it enough). You get rewarded (as said above) not only for TF2, but you can also unlock different tabletops and stuff. Granted you're good enough at poker unlike me. In the end, it's really just that. A well planned out and put together poker game with 4 very memorable characters all from different series.Unfortunately Poker Night 2 was an unfair mess that was truly annoying (at least in my opinion) and had sorta boring unlocks for TF2. Forgetting about that. If you wanna see Homestar Runner, Sam & Max, Penny Arcade, and the TF2 universe combined just to play a simple game of poker, this is definitely worth the $5.

												Poker Night at the Inventory is a fun and surprisingly complex poker simulation. As someone who has pretty much no real experience with poker before playing this game, it's good at explaining the rules and immersing you into the game quickly and simply. There's that addictive quality of ""just one more round"", hoping to increase your balance, or to get the varied achievements or new items, that's a mark of quality in a turn-based game.But of course the real draw of Poker Night at the Inventory is the characters. If you're a fan of Homestar Runner, Team Fortress 2, Penny Arcade, or Sam & Max, or even if you aren't, the characters are going to make you laugh and come back for more. The dialogue is pretty fantastic, with all kinds of fun and dark humor (wait until you hear The Heavy's story about the Engineer). All of the characters fit well into their canon personalities, and even have playing styles that reflect them (e.g. Strong Bad likes to bluff and act all macho with large bets, so he can be vulnerable to called bluffs but is unpredictable about how good his hand really is). This is what really brings the immersion into the game.I would recommend this game to anyone who's interested in poker and/or the IPs involved in the game. It can give you hours of fun, laughs, and a decent challenge for a pretty low price.			",266,183,5,63,65,3,66

												Great game.The interactions between the characters is quite amusing and disturbing.I'm glad someone made a game where you can somewhat ""interact"" with the characters in-game.Although, because I have gotten all the achievement items, I feel like the game is slowly getting boring.Though I do still have a few more achievements to go.I'm afraid that after a while, it will slowly get boring. The characters beginning to say the same things.I wish there was more to win upon achievement items within the game.Other then that, I love the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
