												I bought this game because it reminded me of Champinship Manager. Unfotunately, it's nothing like it. There is little gameplay involved. All you can do is trade players, set up a tactic and press ""Continue"" a hundred times until there's finally a match. There's no ""Training"" option or anything else you would look for in a soccer manager.A plus point is the tutorial section though. Sure, it's very minimalistic but it serves its purpose well and shows what can be done in the game.The game seems to have serious performance issues as well. Loading, saving and basically doing anything takes forever. Kinda hard to believe that this new game struggles, where the old CM 01/02 was so much faster with its huge database.The GUI is not very optimized. Tables are small and leave much space of the rest of the page. Elements like arrows feel kinda awkward to interact with. The date display is also really small.I really want to like this game, but until the performance problems are fixed and the one or other feature is added I would not recommend this game yet.

												I think there's a lot of potential with this game.  It's very basic by nature and those who, like me, spent hours upon hours playing Championship Manager 97/98 many years ago, will recognise the likeness and the 'nod' that this game gives to the old CM series. That's definitely a positive thing for those who want to run through season's a lot quicker than is possible on FM.  It's clear the game is in its infancy as there is indeed some improvements needed in certain areas like searching for players more easily (i.e you cannot filter player skills at the moment) and at least having some kind of basic scouting system too.  However, I believe the game offers a sense of CM nostalgia that's worth tapping into and offers a completely different product to the FM seies by focusing on just the football and none of the other role-playing and media nonsense.  It also seems that the developer is keen to take the game forward and does interact and take on board feedback/ideas on the game's discussion board.  Definitely a thumbs up for players looking for a management game that is most certainly stripped back to the bare bones that allows you to glide through season's.  It is not, however, a game for FM purists who enjoy all the ballyhoo and bravado that comes with that title.			",0,0,1,0,2,0,0

												Great game if you like FA Premier manager on the PSX. I wouldn't compare it with  CM or FM manager, and it's true that the FM series are 'realistic' but I don't want to deal with time consuming tactics, response to players and analysis of the game. 	                                     							  	So some people might ask the question: “then what are you doing in this game?”  The response is simple: 1#Basic tactics 2#player contracts 3# Scouting players from all over the world 4#Selling/loaning/buying players 5# In season edits are possible via Steam file>Save game> Player1>Preseason>.  Basically it's a great game if you like the retro football manager games and don't want to focus too much on the players and the tactics. ",6,0,0,0,3,1,3

												Very poor game that is very overpriced.  The fonts do not scale properly making it difficult to read/play, even when playing in windowed mode. Whilst graphics are really that important for a game of this type, the ones that are there are really poor.  The way that names have been changed is awful.  I don't mind if games are amateurish and I like to support indie game producers, but this game is too much.			",60,8,0,2,15,0,18

												I wish I could upvote, sadly I didn't manage to play a single match. Both times I tried to start a game, it crashed mid July, long before my team's first league appearance.Hopefully it will receive some optimisation and some QOL improvements in the future (blurry fonts and constant need to press continue I'm looking at you!). Also, player filtering by stat value or values would boost the player search usefulness hugely, I hope there is a way the dev can implement it.I wish the best of luck for the game and the developer, I hope someday I will be forced to reevaluate my review. Until then...**Update 4/3/2017**Crashes : Fixed !Constant press Continue : Fixed!Player filtering by skill value : Implemented !Now the game looks and feels much more enjoyable, I started a league just to test the improvements,and it has all the CM feeling I wish it would have. Congrats to the dev for actually caring about the player base feedback, I feel that this game will only get better in the future.If you like old school managers, this one is definitely recommended !

												I am a fan of sports management genre. While its overall design is below average compared to the competitors, still Global Soccer Manager (GSM) have its own selling point. Pros* Whole world localization * Original concept of football management* Easy customization * Straight to the point features* Comprehensive in game guide* Excellent developer supportCons* Lack of game depth* No workshop support* Basic interface designIt is probably the only game that still sticks with the original principle of football management, there are still room for improvement to make this game competitive in terms of playability. Hidden gems with big potential, I would recommend this game for those who looking for straight to the point, casual football management game. Score: 7/10			",74,10,10,10,19,1,25

												TL:DR bottomIt's like a demo version of Championship Manager 92/93. But I'll still recommend it even thou it feels and plays like a 30 year old game.For the price, and considering what epic s*h*i*t*show FM has been the last decade or so competition is surely needed, and this developer seems to have it's heart in the right place. CM of yore took about 10 years to hit its high point around 2002 before if went downhill, and given some money and enough time this game has yet to do the all the errors Football Manager is currently doing. You'll get a few hours outta this game, and hopefully developers are still incentivised to broaden this ""proof of concept"" into a better and more complex football manager. 90's football manager are still far superior and more fun than this, but given time to expand this show promise. Look at this as an investment. Showing developers that there is a market for a proper competitor to SI.TL:DR: Buy it, if not only to give a big middle finger to Sports Interactive for the utterly horrible direction the monopoly flagship of this genre is headed.Pros and cons are quite simple: A pro is that this game has nothing of the superfluous timesinks that football manager does, the con being that it doesn't have much else either yet. The game engine runs like cm'93 but without the pressure bar giving you little indiction if you have the initiative, and it lacks depth still when it comes to player management.
