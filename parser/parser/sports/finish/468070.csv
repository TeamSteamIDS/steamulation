Early Access Review
								90 minute fever may be the most important game of your life.I've played since January , first in alpha version, so now live version. Play evolves constantly , and one of the great parts is that developers really listen to the players.To be early access game has many basic features that make it playable, fun and competiv.It is also important to know that it lacks some essential features that many might miss , like for example to see the development of your players , individual tactical instructions during combat , use made ​​turnements, advanced statics from the game.Nevertheless, all these things come consecutively, and the progress the past six months makes me have my full confidence in the developers. The very best advice from me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								If you're looking for a competitive football management game where you compete against other real-life managers, 90 Minute Fever is definitely better than anything eles currently out there on the market and there is a lot more to come with regards to features and improvements.It's already possible to sink several hours a day into if you're into your management games, but you can also check in for ten or twenty minutes a day and not have any issues.I came from Football Manager Live and there is no doubt that 90 Minute Fever can be a worthy replacement. Would highly recommend this to any football fan, especially those who love Football Manager and want an online experience!			",110,15,4,18,49,2,23

								A long time i waited for a real time manager game. 90 minutesfever has a lot of things i wanted already and also a lot more to come. If you are a manager game addict i am sure that you easily can get addicted and spend a lot of hours playing game with other real life managers, searching for the best players on the market or potential new stars.. Also the developers are very nice people that hear and respond to any issue-complaint you may face and the community is one of the best !!!I am really happy to see that at last a manager game like this was created and lucky i started played it from the start !

								I am a big fan of Football Manager 2016, having recently discovered the series and replacing FIFA in my life with it. Despite this, I am not sure if I will be buying FM17, and that is completely due to 90 Minute Fever. I have only had the game a matter of hours and I love it. Whilst it is not yet as in-depth tactically and administratively as the FM series, I have huge trust in the developers to take it in that direction and it is already huge fun to play. The direct opposition to other players is a huge boost and makes winning feel so much more rewarding and they have got the transfer system absolutely spot on. I can see that this game needs improvement to become truly life-consuming, but I love it already and cannot wait for updates and improvements.As a side note, I don't use steam much and so I really struggled to download and launch this game and then creating a club was very dificult for me. I emailed the suggested email address for help and resigned myself to wasting my weekend waiting for a reply, and even considered giving up and undownloading the game and giving up. Instead, I recieved an email in minutes from a super friendly, kind and obviously capable person (whom I assume is a dev) called Kris, who helped me for no additional charge and was just generally as friendly and as helpful as I could possibly want. I would pay for this game just off the back of how helpful the dev was, and highly recommend it to all audiences.			",4,0,1,1,4,2,2

 NOTE:  I recieved this game for a 2 months subscription due to a promotion by WorkTheSpace and the developers of the game.  This is also for a beta build that is missing features such as staff and an advanced match engine.So let me preface this review by saying what this game is not.Firstly, while it is heavily based on Football Manager, it is not a ""ripoff"" of Football Manager, the closest comparison however would be to an MMO version of Football Manager. Positives So firstly, what are the positives?One thing is community, in 21 hours of the game, I have only seen 1 negative comment in the chat which ironically was due to the community helpers asking for people to share their opinion for the game. Everyone that I have spoken to so far has been very nice and very helpful in certain aspects of understanding the game.The next positive is the fact that everyone starts on a level playing field. When I first launched up the game, I saw that I had an absolutely stunning 21 year old left back who was the best that has been found so far, but I was suprised to see that when I played my first league match, he also had some very good players.This game is not like Fifa 16 Ultimate Team where you have to buy coins or FIFA points to buy half decent players and there are zero microtransactions in this game (as of 18th July 2016)One extra part of the game I like is the ""negotiations"" tab. When someone accepts a bid for their player from another team, instead of that player going instantly to that team, a 24 hour blind bidding process starts where other teams try to sign that player. This system not only prevents cheating but it lets casual players ignore the mostly tedious manual scouting process that Football Manager offers.The last positive is that you can actually sign legends in the game in the form of a ""youth intake"" in the Youth Players tab, so far none of them are available, since they ""unlock"" from the 24th July onwards if I remember correctly, but it sounds like a very good system and the developers also have the player's wikipedia pages linked to them if you want to learn about their history. Negatives However there are a few negatives to this game aswell.Firstly, the match engine so far is not nearly advanced enough to be considered adequate, there are some stats that are far more important than others, for example strikers with good finishing are typically much better goalscorers than ones with better dribbling or better physical stats.One other feature that is suprisingly not in the game yet is the lack of a rating system for your players, in Football manager you have a star system that represents how good your player is compared to the rest of your team, however here the star system is used to represent reputation which seems somewhat meaningless considering a simple post in the chat can increase a players reputation due to the people viewing his player page.The last negative is the fact that you need to subscribe to play. The price is very tempting I must admit, and it does enable users to pay a small amount and if they dont like the game they can just not renew their subscription, but for long time players you have to pay a lot of money just to play the game for a year.This game has bucketloads of potential and I just hope that the developers will keep updating the game. I advise that if you wish to buy the game, get 3 months first and see how much the developers update the game.TL:DR+ Not P2W+ Very good community+ Actually fun for casual and serious players alike+ You can buy legends- Some features are lacking- Match Engine needs an overhaul- No direct rating system			",307,25,8,34,65,5,41

Early Access Review
								I find myself writing this review to try and be fair to the developers whilst at the same time hopefully helping some potential buyers from purchasing this game under false impressions.  I don't know exactly how one is supposed to review an Early Access game.  Everyone seems to be doing it differently.  I believe this game should be reviewed in its current state, but it clearly also matters where the game is going to end up as well, and it also is extremely important in my opinion for EA how well the developers are supporting and progressing their game.  First and foremost I would say: read the information on the store page, especially the Early Access information.  I have no idea how on earth anyone could possibly buy an Early Access game without reading this information first, but it seems many people do.  This game is in the middle of being developed.  Anyone expecting a completed game is going to be left disappointed.   That being said, I find the current state of the game highly enjoyable, as do many others, but it is certainly not for everyone. I believe it is causing a problem that is potentially misleading people, both with positive and negative reviews and comments, that pretty much everyone seems to be constantly comparing this game to Football Manager and the no-longer-existent Football Manager Live.  It is absolutely ridiculous and wholly unfair to the developers of this game for it to be compared to either of these games.  One of them is a single player game and the other one doesn't exist.  It just doesn't makes any sense to me. If what you want is a single player football management game, then you should not be reading this review - you should be playing Football Manager.  You should only stay here continuing to read my review if the online multiplayer aspect is important to you. What this game should be getting compared to are all of other online football management games that do actually exist.   Games like Hattrick, Top Eleven, Virtual Manager, Trophy Manager and the 100's of other games like these.  The thing that initially drew me to 90 Minute Fever was  precisely because of the online aspect and their promise of no pay to win elements as I absolutely hate any games that have these.  From all of these other online football management games the best experience I could personally find was playing Hattrick, which is in theory free to play but in reality you pretty much must have a membership package in order to play properly which can cost upwards of 20 Euros per month.  90 Minute Fever costs a fraction of this amount to play and in my opinion offers a vastly superior play experience to all of these other online football management games, even in its current state.  It's an added bonus for me that it also comes with the promise that it is only going to get better and better and better.   It is obvious that this game has been designed to have no pay to win elements, which is critically important for me - I wouldn't care how good this game were - if it was pay to win - I would not have any interest at all. This game is extremely challenging.  It is PvP on a balanced, well designed and fair playing field.  It is clearly designed with the long term in mind.  That you need to build towards goals over time.  Anyone who is unable to handle losing is going to struggle with this game.  Anyone with a 'win now' mentality is also going to struggle.  For me this is great, I want a long term and engaging challenge.  But this type of game is not for everyone.   I would say as a general rule, if you have ever quit and loaded up a saved game in any single player football management game because you lost a match you feel you shouldn't have lost - then this game is not for you - it's as simple as that.  There are no second chances.  Every single result has to be earned.  It is ruthless, it is challenging, it is emotional and it can be extremely frustrating at times.  But all of these things are what make the play experience so rewarding.  I want my success to have meaning, and the only way it will have this is if it is a real challenge to achieve it. As many other users have said in their reviews, I also feel this game has huge potential.   More importantly, I believe this game is going to live up to its potential because from what I've seen from the developers I am very impressed.  They are engaging with users, working seemingly all hours of each and every day, are very responsive, are highly active on the forums and have already released a major update to the game despite having been on Early Access for less than 1 month.  They are clearly very passionate and committed to developing this game.  How the developers engage with their community, how they support their product, and how much progress they are making to further develop their game, are in my opinion, the most important things by far for an Early Access game, and the developers behind this game I believe are right up there with the best you're ever likely to find working on an EA game.

Early Access Review
								Ive been playing this game for around 11 months now so i would say i can give a decent viewpoint. The game is an entry level FML comparison and offers a great experience for those that enjoy footy management sims. It has both custom and  real life players which return as 16 year old legends Such as Paul Gascoigne or Valderama etc and every season these should increase in quality.Game play is good, you customise your team name, colours etc then analyse a starting squad, dont sell to quickly and look for some bargain quality players which are frequently available cheap. Then set up your tactics and compete against similar level opposition in qualifier leagues.The best bit about this game which differs from FML is that new guys can compete very fast and its proven time and time again in regards to finances and results.The second best bit is the auction style transfer system which does much more to eliminate and possible cheating which burdened FML. The ME is good but could be better , but i believe it is at the foremost of their upgrade plans along with a 2d engine and staff/stadiums.Community is great and one suprising factor is the developent team play in game and often contibute to discussion.Overall , a very sound investment.PS, i want to have Dirks babies xxAny questions whilst playing, you can see me at team name Borussia teeth.

								Exelent football manager game. Game that every true football manager player must try. I highly reccomended the game. I'm playing Football Manager Series from the beggining, and I always have fun playing it back somethinkg is missing. Then, when Football Manager Live was avalible back in quite some years from now, i ralased what. MMO.90MF gives, for me, all aspect of true MMO fotball manager game, and it's not even finnished. But I could play it like it is. Community in game is great, ME is decent, transfer sistem and transfer market done perfectly. Gives u a chance to be a big or small club with equaly satisfaction felling. There is no pay to win features in game, so only your skills in picking players and select right tactic counts. The game mechanic is done in a way that newcomer can be equal with the most experiance player in game in matter of season or two.This game is apsoluty ""must try"" for any football manager fun.

								""This game is legitimate trash I feel ashamed I put hours into it""The reason I have 100+ hours is due to the fact that nothing comes close to this game in terms of what it is, imagine something like dayz but dayz is the only zombie survival online mmo out there. You get the jist of it. The problem with this game is how random it is, you're literally playing with dice every match no players feel any different to one another unless a striker has 17 finishing. The updates takes months and they are so small and they do not justify the purchase I have made for this game. Took about 6 months since I've owned the game to add staff to the game thats just an example of how slow the updates are.The game takes no skill at all just have a striker with 17 shooting and you'll be banging about 35 goals a season, easy as that.The community consists of about 60 people and mostly ai who will stomp you regardless of the fact they have players out of position and with bad stats.This game has no way of telling you how well your team is doing with their formations etc because every game is random no matter who you're playing. e.g I could stomp a team with Theirry Henry in it then be stomped by a team with ali dia it's that stupid.

								quality game, Closest thing to FML since it closed 6 years ago. it is still a work in progress but getting better all the time.  I signed up for 12 months after seeing beta progress.  Sure it can be frustrating at time but its addictive :)Throughly recommended and at 12 months for £2.50 a month is not expensive at all. ",1,0,0,1,1,0,1

								I was one of many who felt a great loss when FMLclosed so when 90 minute fever came along i thought to myself lets give it a go hoping it could replace the void lefy by FML. I have to say i am not disapointed one bit, the game is so playable and thoroughlt enjoyable. The developers are constantly adding new features and are also willing to listen to any ideas we have to offer. they dont just listen though they act on any ideas as well. Although not the finished article yet i honestly believe this will surpass FML eventually. If anyone is in two minds about purchasing the game then all i wil say is give it a go, i dont think many will regret it.Hopefully see you all in gameKevStrummerville FC			",4,0,0,0,2,0,1

								Highly recommended! I am completely hooked despite that the game is very much still in development. The devs have been able to provde enough content to keep us interested. It is not only about football - it is about building a solid economy and a vibrant and friendly community (who to a large portion have been in exile since FML was cancelled 5 years ago). The money you put into this game quickly becomes a very very low hourly fee and I realy hope the game will survive and prosper to become the wonderful produt it has the potential to be.

								Still a rough stone but steadily becoming a diamond! Almost everday its massasing your brain and pulling your cheeks up to make you smile.Sometimes its a win sometimes its an attribute increase of one of you young upcoming stars.Sometimes its a nice joke or conversation in the world chat window jokes about what attribute you would like to see in your wife, finishing or workrate.All in all a nice game where its own attributes are still increasing day by day to become its own world class.

Early Access Review
								There is way too much to say(have over 1800 hours on record in this game), so will try to simplify:- they claim it's ""no pay to win""; however, they have set up a patreon page and every monthly built is ran by the patreons, who get special insights into the game and private session with devs; - transparency is the biggest problem: they invented a lot of concepts to provide themselfes with plausible deniability. This results in stuff like ""100 users complain that X does not seem logical"". Sure enough, the reply is coded in ""well, there are hidden attributes you can't see"" or similar, each time amounting to either unverifiable or only verifiable by those with direct access to the DB(so devs)- they hate free speech; plain and simple, they implemented a chat-ban feature where people can ban you from chatting without providing any reason or evidence; the idea is ""if enough people blacklist you, then it must be a problem""; this has resulted in a group-power dynamic within the game; People are getting banned daily for speaking their minds.- they are UK-centric: if you are not from the UK, you will wonder why all uk-based legends in game have incredible stats, way better than most brazilians or argentinians or any other nation; if you don't subscribe to a worldview where UK players are better than everyone else, you will hate this- the ONLY part that is attractive about this game is the MMO aspect, because as a Player VS AI game, it's at least 10 years behind FM series. So you would think they would put emphasis on the one thing they have better than FM. Sadly, it is quite the opposite: save for a few cases, in general, absentees is rewarded, so is dodging games etc ... - warning: they also lie, so many people were deceived into buying this because on their sale page they showed a 2d match engine which still doesn't exist; this is false marketing, i will report this @Steam and hopefully they will make them remove the false marketing.There are a few lads that i found in-game that have made the experience worth it, outside of it i would not recommend this to anyone who enjoys logic and hates communism.(they have implemented extremely marxist philosophies in-game: it's not about merit, it's about spreading the wins, as they put it oh so ""veiled"").Last year, i exposed the devs on outright lying to non-technical users(am an experienced developer myself), they banned me for months from speaking, if you are ok with basicly being abused by larger groups and not being able to say anything in chat because ""someone could get offended and he who is offended is always right"" then, by all means get this game.In short, i don't recommend it at this stage or at least until they change their authoritarian ways. They have no problem taking monthly fees from you for months and then banning you for an opinion which sheds the wrong kind of light on them. They never even consider stopping the creepy stuff they do(btw, the devs are competing with the userbase while having access to hidden attributes, database etc - and you can see how lucky they get each time with their buys, it's uncanny), they only ever do ""damage control"". No intention of changing their scamming ways, sorry to report.			",7,0,2,1,3,2,9

								This is already a very addictive and enjoyable game to play, even at this stage of development. When all of the planned features are implemented the game is going to be brilliant! The game will especially appeal to ex-FML players like myself!I've really enjoyed being involved in the beta testing of this game for the past few months.  The progress the developers have made in that time has been impressive.The developers are very hands-on and I have had a lot of contact with them.  They have a very clear vision of where they want to go with this game, and have excellent reasoning behind each design decision they have made.The fact that this game is NOT P2W is hugely important to me.  The main draw for me with this game is that to do well you have to use your skill and judgment, not your wallet.  Everyone pays exactly the same monthly subscription and contends on an equal footing.I'm looking forward to having more tactical options in the game and especially to the 2D match engine being introduced so that I can get a better view of how my tactics are working.  At this stage options are limited from a tactical point of view but the developers have been developing the match engine at a good rate and I have no doubt that the finished match engine will be very good.Overall, I can't recommend this game highly enough.  It's hugely addictive and the community is very friendly and helpful.  A must for any footy fan who is bored of playing management games against the computer and wants the challenge of testing themselves against ""real"" people!			",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

								If anyone ever played Football Manager Live, the online version of Football Manager before it got shut down a few years ago, this is as close as you will get to that experience again.It is currently in the beta stage and far from finished but there is enough going on to occupy a manager for a few hours a day.I'd say it is a risk running a subscription fee during this process as most players are getting free month codes and it will be hard to determine the games population once those run out but I believe the finished product will well be worth it.It does need work as I said but the developers are open with the players and have already implemented a few suggestions so they are wiling to cater to their customers if suggestions are sensible and can improve the game.Recommended for any football fans that want a decent mmo experience at football management.

								A new genre for any Football Manager fan. its basically football manager as an MMO, you create a team name and badge and get given a sqaud of players. these players are of mixed quality but at a level that can compete with more established teams, The transfer system is set in a way to promote fairness and resrtict cheating by using an ebay style auction system. working your way through the divisions while assembling a team made up of real life retired players and random generated players adds another element of strategy to the game, while the ME needs more development i understand that the devs are focusing as much time as possible on creating a brand new ME which is due fairly soon, and in my honest opinion i think that once the new ME is released this will be an absolutly awesome game.

								(Early Access Review)The base game even in early access is very good; and while I haven't read ANY of the reviews posted on this game, I suspect that new players with little patience or an aversion to analytics may find the early access version boring at times, and for that reason I would say that ""adults"" are the target market for early access.So if you are a sucker for management games and love football then definitaly give this a go. If you also enjoy playing the fantasy football leagues (e.g. FPL, etc.) and are forever tinkering away at your team while fighting the urge to do extra transfers each weak then this game is a must-buy. Your FPL team will love you for it. The exciting upcoming feature in a couple of weeks is the introduction of youth leagues. I suspect this will more than adequately satisfy those that find 90MF a bit slow at the present.  For it to be truly great however (as with most mmo's) it could do with a larger base. So don't be shy, you'll just make the game bigger and better and have a say in how it evolves, Based on the effort, comittment, communication, involvement, and approachability displayed by the Devs and Admins I would rate this game as having tons of genuine potential beyond what is already a good game.There are no smoke and mirrors about this dev team - they are working to make it better, and genuinely value your opinions and in my experience have been fantastic. You will see the devs/admins actively engaging the game community via the forums, podcasts, and often hangout online in the game chat lobby where they are willing to answer random questions, take feedback, provide updates, and generally listen and respond to the player base on the smallest to the biggest issues. In this day and age, i find this level of interaction very refreshing and as such should be celebrated as a big positive. So for those that can relate to my review, my Buy/Sell/Hold recommendation is:    BUY ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								For all those of you looking for a new FML, I have one thing to say. Forget it. This game, at least at the time being, is awful. The match engine is totally random. There is absolutely nothing you can do and change the outcome of a match, unless the engine wants it. The match is only commentary at the time being, consisting of like 10 phrases. There are no corners in the matches.  Player stats and positions don't make sense. Players with awful stats for some reason shine and others with decent stats just don't. Positions do not matter, a player that plays naturally as DC and performs, will perform even as an AMC or ST. Game economy is broken already in my opinion and the ""returning stars"" feature is a joke as these players will become superstars even if they play regularly or not. Overall, this game should not have been released yet. I really hope that it will manage to become something close to FML we all miss but at the time being, I feel that it is one of the worst games I've ever played.			",13,0,0,6,1,0,5
