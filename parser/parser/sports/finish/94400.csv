This game is truly amazing as a local vs. experience. Plus, the sound track on some of those stages is amazing. Great game, increadibly precise, but accessible. Tons of fun!			",132,38,0,19,9,1,24

												You're at the last part of the level and one enemy stands in your way. It gives you this giddy feeling, those 5 seconds of a showdown, staring down your opponent, waiting to see who's going to make the first move. The adrenaline starts pumping after you charge in for the first swing and your opponent counters and knocks your sword out of your hand. You're swordless. You close your eyes and take a deep breath as your opponent charges at you with his sword. Seconds before impact you leap and flip over his head, grab your sword, turn around and throw it right through his head. As he falls to the ground you spit on his body and sprint through the gate to the cheering of thousands of spectators.Then a giant worm eats you. Victory.This game rocks. I'll start off with that. You got these tiny little guys with swords fencing for their lives back and forth as the bodies pile up. This is the kind of game that you can actually be skillful at, by watching the o0ther person's sword you can try to figure out how to counter what he's doing. It has a mortal combat type ladder single player where you play through a bunch of levels against harder and harder characters and I've managed to get about halway up. Not sure if there are lives but if you lose you continue from the same character you don't have to start over.I'm most excited for the multiplayer though, I can't wait to invite some friends over to play this because this is one of those games which will cause a lot of screaming and yelling. I just played a random person through the matchmaking a bunch of times and it worked flawlessly, I'm excited to play more.Also in the multiplayer section where there's offline and other options for multiplayer there are a whole sleuth of ""variants"": Slow mo, Fast mo, boomerang swords, divekicks, throwing and other stuff.Really not a bad learning curve. Yeah, the first couple of rounds you can't figure out what the hell is going on, but after 15 minutes of trial and error I was leaping, stabbing, and doing a lot of other weird♥♥♥♥♥♥ Music's not shabby, you got the shwing shwing of the swords in there so I'm happy.The game makes you feel like that guy from Princess Bride with those wiggly swords.The bad: No windowed mode, and the how to play menu is broken to all hell. Just check the controls and go with it.It's just a fun game, it's got a lot of replay value and it would always be cool to see more levels or maybe... hats?			",195,40,11,27,40,1,13

												Probably few people have heard about Nidhogg. At first glance it's a simple 2D fighting with 8-bit graphics. But is it really?　I CHALLENGE YOU TO A PIXEL DUEL　　There is no plot in Nidhogg. Instead, only fights with a computer opponent or with other people in online. The meaning of each battle is not killing the enemy, but in achieving the opposite end of the map. Four keys for movement, one key for punch and one key for jump. Sounds easier than it actually is. In fact, fightings are very funny and full of madness, but not without subtleties of the combat system. I advise you to play only in the company of friends. Singleplayer and online battles with strangers doesn't bring much fun.　NOT ENOUGH PIXELS　　Nidhogg has enough of advantages to buy it. But there are some unpleasant drawbacks. Too few maps, quickly bored gameplay, inconvenient system for playing online with friends (A friend is not always able to connect to your game). These shortcomings, in fact, are not much spoiling the gaming experience. If it were not for one thing. Too high price. Seriously. It should cost twice less, judging on how many content in it.　Multiplayer:　　Online: ☺☺☺☺☺OOOOO　　Co-op: Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ 　Storyline: Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ 　Graphics: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺OOO　Gameplay: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺OO　Complexity of the achievements: Some achievements will make you play this game for a long time. And not all of them can be easily performed.　　　Nidhogg is a game with a so much　　fun and madness, but with so few　　levels and other content. If you're don't　　mind to spending so much money on it,　　then you'll are sure to spend a few fun　　evenings.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　To buy or not to buy, that is the question [6.5/10].

												Way too expensive for what it is. Although it's a very fun local game or just to play online with a friend that's close, there's barely any content here. I believe there's just 4 maps in this, only 1 type of weapon, and no netplay with random people. Once in awhile it's fun to pick up and play, but definitely not worth the price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nidhogg is a fast paced, local multiplayer focused fencing game developed by Messhof. In Nidhogg you take up fencing and fight one on one matches against AI or other players through local or online multiplayer. The aim of the game is to make it past your opponent and run to the other side of the map.+Awesome pixel graphics+Simple gameplay, all you have to do is stab your opponent and run to the other side of the map, it might sound boring but it's actually really entertaining, especially when playing with friends+The different maps are very different to each other which provides some nice variation for the game+Nidhogg can be enjoyed in Singleplayer, Local Multiplayer and Online Multiplayer/Matchmaking+The fast-paced side-scrolling nature of Nidhogg makes it perfect for playing in Local Multiplayer and things get pretty intense, making Local Multiplayer pretty exhilirating and the best way to enjoy the game+Nidhogg features a tournament mode which allows 3-8 players to play Local Multiplayer+The soundtrack is great and fits with the game well+The fighters in the game are all brightly coloured and blood basically acts like paint for the maps so you end up with some pretty cool designs on the floor if one area of the map gets particularly bloody+Both the KB&M controls and the 360 Gamepad controls are very good and very responsive-Nidhogg has a severe lack of content due to only having four maps, for £10.99 that kind of content really isn't good enough-Singleplayer gets repetitive (thanks to the lack of content) very quickly-Until recently Online Multiplayer wasn't very good (due to lag mainly) but it has been fixed, sadly it would seem not many people who own Nidhogg know that it was fixed since the game's Online Multiplayer remains pretty much deadVerdict:Highly Recommended, but Only When Discounted (6.5/10)Nidhogg is a great, fast paced fighting game with awesome graphics and simple gameplay, sadly the game is very much let down by its lack of content and high asking price. If you're looking for what is one of the best Local Multiplayer games on Steam and you don't mind paying the high price then give Nidhogg a go, if not, wait for a sale.No drama, Just Reviews.El K.

												This game is somewhat of a double-edged sword. If you have a friend (or enemy) who is in the room with you, this game is great. Otherwise, you probably shouldn't get it.The game plays like an elaborate dance; two players fighting for the honour of being consumed by the titular serpent- the Nidhogg. The controls are simple: one button jabs your sword, one button makes you jump. The real beauty is how the mechanics blend together. Swords can be moved up and down to reach a jumping or ducking enemy. Swords at the same height will clash, and can block the opposing player's attacks. Swords can also be knocked out of a players hand by some particularly crafty swordplay. Jousting with your sword fully raised throws your sword through the air, which is hard to dodge, but leaves you without your best weapon. Thrusting in midair results in a divekick, a techniquie used to relieve the enemy of their weapon (that is, if you don't impale yourself on their weapon first). The result is an EXTREMELY intense sword battle. Matches can last for seconds, others can last for half of an hour or more. The ducking and dodging and jumping and running blends brilliantly with the game's glitch-art style and kickass music. You can play this before the start of a lecture. You can play this at a party, with a tournament of eight players. You can use it as a substitute for rock-paper-scissors in decision-making situations. It's become one of my go-to games when friends are over (see also: touhou 9).However, this only applies if you have real-life friends. Sure, the game has online play, but it's horribly laggy and bugged, with no sign of a fix. The lag ruins the crucial fast-paced action of the game and usually results in the host player winning. Because of this, you'll be very lucky to actually find anyone through the matchmaking service. The single-player mode is basically multiplayer but against a series of bots, which each have distinct playstyles and weaknesses. It's very much like playing against real players, but nowhere near as fun as having friends to play with in the same room. Additionally, the price is VERY steep for what the contents of the game are: only four (admittedly BEAUTIFUL) levels. Overall: One of the best local multiplayer games that exist. If you have real friends that can come over and play: get this game ...but get it during a sale. If you have no friends: sorry, this game isn't for you. Go out and make some friends instead!

												This is my first review on steam.This game is awesome to play against friends, it is intense and purely skill based. The biggest problem with this is the multiplayer system only works when it wants to so you can't even play online with your buddies unless the ""Server"" is feeling okay. When the server is working which is probably isn't right now, you are unable to customize the online multiplayer match which is a huge part of the multiplayer experience in nidhogg. In conclusion this is not a $15 game. I am glad I bought it for $3 and it is worth that when it is working. Offline mode locally I am sure is the only use for this game. Do not pay $15, beyond waste.			",116,29,1,19,14,0,23

												Don't always go for the top reviews like I did with this one. This game looked fantastic in the videos. It actually is if you go by the single player mode which doesn't last long and (more importantly) local multiplayer. Local multiplayer is where this shines. If you engage in this frequently, get it. I only have occasional local multiplayer games and this is why it was a bad purchase for me and might be for you.There hasn't been one update since this game's release. The guy ignored EVERY support request and then had the cheek to release it on the PS4. Why is this a problem? The netcode is HORRIBLE, and latency is the most important factor with a game where reaction time can be very important. If you play online and enjoy it consistently, get back to me, because that would be the first I've heard about it. Players will teleport more than in Counter-Strike in the '90s and is more buggy than the Master Chief Collection.			",1371,539,52,154,143,18,198

												I have been looking forward to this game for a long time, and figured that after 3 years of ""development"" (or what ever they were doing with it before releasing) this would be a really well polished game, and it is to a great extent. 	The offline 2 player duel gameplay is simply amazing, hectically fast and fun twitch game. Playing with a friend could grant you countless hours of fun. The graphics are beautiful. If this was a freeware game it would be great, if it was $2 it would be great, however it is priced at 15$ which is too much to pay for the amount of content (which is 4 arenas and a tacked on single player mode) 	Now the bad things are, as some people have mentioned; The ONLINE multilayer is currently  unplayable, a big bummer for me. Another really big bummer is that in fact, it does NOT have ""full"" controller support; It does support fancy Xbox controllers, but it would not recognize my lovely SNES style USB controllers which other games recognize just fine. So ya, this coupled with a 15$ price tag and lack of content leads me to a thumb down :( sorry. 	Once again it IS a great 2 player offline game, and I will be playing it a lot when I have friends over, but its not worth 15$. Wait till this game is cheaper and patched for proper controller support and online play, then it will be worth it.EDIT: GOOD: I have had a few good online games with minimal lag, but it is rare with random matches. BAD:  Game variant options do not seem work in online matches.			",237,73,1,17,50,2,40

												Nidhogg provides some of the fastest and most enjoyable monochromatic bloodletting one could hope to experience.   The premise is simple.  You are a pixelated swordsman in a territorial conflict with your opponent, most often your best friend sitting right beside you.  Each standoff is lightning fast, and invariably ends in a gratuitous splattering of blood.   Kill your opponent with a well-timed and well-placed lunge, hurl your épée at his head, or just knock him down and rip his heart out.  Savagery is encouraged, and provides a hilarious counterpoint to the civilized image of fencing.  Once you have managed to kill your opponent, you can progress to your goal until just seconds later, he respawns and you must again defeat him to progress. Lose, and he gains ground on you. This ebb and flow continues until one of you reaches the final screen where the winner is given a true hero’s sendup: He is eaten by a flying worm.Nidhogg is not just a circus of inanity and violence, but is some of the best fun you can have with your friends.  Controls are responsive, animations are fast and smooth, and landing consecutive killing blows provides a jolt of dopamine that keeps you coming back for more.  There are multiple arenas to choose from, each one visually unique and designed to make you rethink your strategy.  Some corridors are too tight for jumping or sword throwing, so both your opponent and the landscape will make you think on your toes.Visually, Nidhogg exhibits a unique combination of minimalism through pixilation and solid colors.  It highlights the expression of characters through animation rather than textures.  It is aesthetically arresting and securely has its own style.  These visuals are elevated even further when coupled with an exceptional soundtrack by Daedelus.Nidhogg could have provided only the core one-on-one experience, but if you look deeper there are a lot of extras.  There is a tournament mode supporting up to 8 players. There is a multitude of variants in gameplay to explore. There is a single player experience pitting you against an increasingly difficult array of AI personalities.  Additionally, there is an online multiplayer component, but at the time of this review, I experienced some unfortunate glitches.  In several matches I experienced moments where I killed my opponent, but immediately the game changed states, and my character unexplainably died.  It wasn’t often, but it was often enough to sour the experience.  I’m told that the online component is still a work in progress, so if you don’t have a friend handy to play local multiplayer check the forums for progress.Nidhogg was first shown in 2010, and since then Messhoff, comprised of Mark Essen and Kristy Norindr, have worked to shine the core game into a full-fledged release.  Nidhogg is available today on Steam for $11.99, and if you have friends, it is well worth your dollars.			",195,34,2,32,11,2,38

												Nidhogg is not bad at all in terms of gameplay. I won’t go into much detail because the trailers and such pretty much show what it's about, but its damn fun to play. The combat has a lot of options and things going for it and nicely juggles both complexity and ease of learning. The music and visuals match and mesh with the feel of the combat excellently. I can easily see how co-op can be a blast with friends, or the tourney potential. So why is this not recommended? Because the devs cared more about the game’s style, raw gameplay, and media hype then its long-term substance or support. You’re playing this game and having a lot of fun, and then before you even hit the one hour mark you find yourself thinking “that’s it?” and then it’s all downhill from there. Singleplayer consists of you fighting a dozen or two progressively harder AI opponents, however the stages start looping after opponent four. Yep, only four stages. There’s no story to speak of or even an attempt at one, and once you’re done with it you’re left with nearly nothing else to do with the game. Multiplayer is dead, D-E-A-D. Its features are minimal and in terms of functionality the MP barely worked when the game came out, and then because they never fixed it people gave up on it entirely so there’s no one playing. This game deserved more support and more features and updates from a solid company. But because it didn’t get that and most likely won’t ever, I am sorry to say that charging $15 for this is broad daylight robbery and I cannot recommend it. Only buy this if it’s on sale, and with the understanding that outside of being a weekend distraction or occasional hour of fun with a friend this game has no value.			",354,63,2,52,29,2,59

												Nidhogg embodies the aggressive, intoxicating thrill of competition. Through hazily defined personas and their ethereal exacting movements, a simple duel is transformed into a bustling frenzy of close saves, impossible luck, and overlapping cries of victory and defeat. It only took one match for me to fall in love with Nidhogg – to be hooked by the overwhelming energy that erupts both inside and outside the game – and hours later each round continues to bring with it that same feeling that I’m discovering something incredible for the first time and desperately need someone to share it with.In the most concise and direct of terms, Nidhogg is a two-player fencing game which calls back to the simpler times of 80’s arcade classics like Joust and Pong, but bridges the generational gap with a precision and adrenaline that would have melted the insides of the quarter devouring machines which have grown extinct over the last 30 years. Nidhogg’s indirect heritage doesn’t define it so much as provides a sense of place for Nidhogg where so many other games are quickly lost and forgotten. Already it feels like a classic I’ve loved for years and a staple game that is kept installed eternally as part of an evergreen collection of multiplayer games.Nidhogg works so immensely well because it’s the sort of game you stop thinking about almost immediately. Controlling your swordsman in Nidhogg is impeccably intuitive as they move and react contextually and clearly, causing you to forget about how your controlling them as you focus all your attention on what you’re actually doing. Nidhogg feels much like a spontaneous dance between two people attempting to kill each other. It’s not about executing a particular move or performing a perfect counter block, but allowing yourself to be taken by the moment as you and your opponent flow together in a blur of kicks and stabs as you fight against each other in a deadly tug of war.The organic interplay which develops over the course of a match helps keep Nidhogg from ever feeling one-sided the way many multiplayer games do. Everything which takes place during a match is the dual result of two players colliding and reacting with one another, which forms a dynamic that feels cordial and joyful. Even during my worst matches I often found myself erupting in laugher over my own mistakes and haphazard attempts to regain ground, because even when I’m losing Nidhogg’s ridiculous pace and explosions of pixels are still ludicrously fun to be a part of.To me the lifespan of a multiplayer game is almost entirely based on whether or not it’s enjoyable to the person losing, and I’ve never played a competitive game where me and my supposed competitor have fallen into such fits of laughter precisely because we’re losing. Nidhogg is a brilliantly tactical and engaging beast of a fighting game, but that it can also allow for a much friendlier mood and feel satisfying even when you’re outmatched is a remarkable achievement very few other games can boast.I suppose it has to be mentioned though that there is one rather enormous qualifier to recommending Nidhogg, that being the requirement of another local player. Though there is a single player mode it feels like a lifeless shell of its multiplayer counterpart, only potentially worth venturing into as a means of practicing advanced strategies against increasingly tough AI opponents. The online mode as well, despite being fairly functional, can’t compete with the feeling of having another person in the room with you (even more so if you are playing against random players). It will suffice if you have absolutely no other options, but I found myself growing tired of it fairly quickly and wishing the person I was playing with was sitting next to me instead of on the other end of the internet.I desperately hope that whoever is reading this won’t be hamstrung by a lack of local competition though, as with another person in the room Nidhogg is a phenomenal experience that takes only moments to sell itself but has had me repeatedly stuck in place for hours at a time, always shocked when I finally look at the clock and realize how long we’ve been playing. It’s a finely tuned machine you won’t notice and a catalyst for the delightful multiplayer mayhem that few other games have come anywhere close to matching for me.Developer Messhof understands that multiplayer means more than putting two players on the screen; that making sure multiple people are having fun isn’t as simple as letting them play together, and that creating a friendly competition in a space where there can be only one winner is perhaps the easiest thing to screw up and the most imperative to get right. Nidhogg doesn’t assume what it’s doing is easy the way a lot of similar games seem to, but knows if it can get it right that the end result is an atmosphere and enthusiasm that can’t be matched. Wow, did they ever follow through on that one.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. ",845,336,29,79,64,6,112

												This is certainly a fun little game that is best played at a party. It gets lots of laughs. What you see in the trailer is exactly what you get - it is fairly bare-bones, which is ok because it works well. What is not ok is the asking price. Fifteen bucks for what I believe is only three levels and very little options just doesn't make me happy. I got it for like two bucks and I still don't really play it all that much.My main problems:-Too much money for not nearly enough content (not to compare or anything but Christ I got Minecraft for 13$)-They could certainly add in more variation (I mean idk - how about different fighters/colors/levels/weapons/etc.)			",561,162,5,75,79,8,72

												The game is fun, but the price tag is way too steep. The game does provide some pretty fun 1v1 moments with friends, but you wont be playing for a long time. Wait for a sale, and make sure you have someone to play with.			",140,12,1,10,10,1,12

												Excellent dueling game... unfortunately that means it takes two to make it any fun. Quality game that's hindered in my opinion by being somewhat overpriced (and it hasn't had any good sales yet either).Too many good games that sell for similar or cheaper for this strictly 1v1 game to compete based on value for price.EDIT: It just got the sale it needed. Consume, at this price it's most definitely worth adding to your gaming portafolio.			",2198,857,88,271,225,28,362

												Want a fun little game where the pure aim is to stab your friends repeatedly and run to the other side of the map? Then this is the game for you!Pros: The game is fun, fast paced, keeps you on your toes, music is perfect for the game and comedic moments are never far behind.Cons:It's very limited, you fight your way to the other side of the map then rinse and repeat.Matchmaking is terrible it takes too long to find an opponent unless you are playing against friends, this is primarily due to the fact that having very little to do in the game results in short play times and once you've done it there's really no need to go back.Overall:It's not really worth the money for what it is. It's very fun but the fun will soon run out. I would only recommend it if you have the money to spend on it for only a couple hours of fun. ",505,97,11,63,45,4,72

												Nidhogg is a simplistic fencing game, the winner being the one who comes out on top in a contest of deadly tug-of-war, with a welcoming art style, dynamic soundtrack, a polite attention to detail and incredibly pleasing vistas, this game warms you inside, as you physically and mentally try to out-do your opponent and advance screens. The price isn't totally agreeable, £10.99 ($15) is a tad steep in my opinion as there isn't too much to do alone. However, this game shines in its co-op fun factor. Attemping to line up your friend(s) on your sword like a pixelated shish kebab is very amusing and you'll find yourselves having a blast whenever you're together and Nidhogg's involved. If you've got a buddy to have a 'stab' at this game with then do. Other than that, it's most probably worth getting for yourself in a sale, and only in a sale.			",357,48,13,18,26,1,11

												Gameplay always comes first, beyond story or visuals. Gameplay is what makes a game tick. And gameplay is where Nidhogg shines.It's tense tactical game where your skills as a player matter as much as your ability to lure and trick your opponent. It's a subtle give and take, of establishing patterns only to break them, of intimate moments of stillness and caution as the two of you step back and forth anticipating the first strike.It's a game where all are equally matched, where true skill decides the victor rather than the perks, upgrades, boosters of so many other gamesThe simplicity of the controls hide a surprisingly tense and strategic game. One hit kills and there's a wide range of moves and maneuvers at your disposal. While I love Samurai Gunn's lightning fast speed and more varied maps, Nidhogg's slower paced, more cerebral challenge is absolutely addicting. And while you may be able to leap through the air with ease in Samurai Gunn, your moveset is far more versatile in Nidhogg. The smooth animations give each fight a fluid dynamic feel.Not that the visuals are bad either. The surreal graphics and chunky pixels give the game a style all its own. And while the number of maps may seem small, it's definitely a case of quality over quanity. Each map is unique, with its own eccentricities to be mastered from the concealing high grass of the Wilds to the collapsing bridges in Clouds. Not only that, each map consists of several areas as you and your opponent push back and forth to victory. Epic 20 minute duels are not uncommonI rarely play online games, but Nidhogg has me hooked. This is a must play			",486,90,9,35,36,2,34

												Nidhogg is a side scrolling fighting game which was released in early 2014. You duel against another sword wielding foe.  You have to get to the other side of the map before your opponent. In order to do so, you must run, jump, throw your sword and slide past the other enemies. The actual gameplay is very simple, just kill the other guy really. This can be done in a number of ways, the most common is just to kill the enemy in a sparing match. You can also disarm your opponent by knocking their weapon out of their hands leaving them very vulnerable with just their fists to fight back with. You can get quite technical if you want though, by wall jumping, dive kicks and knocking down enemies by sliding their feet out. Nidhogg has a single player mode, which is quite enjoyable, but can be completed in about two hours if you have any sort of skill at the game. The single player is essentially the four different levels repeated over and over increasing in difficulty. While I did have fun playing this mode, the real fun from Nidhogg comes out of the local multiplayer mode. This will pit you against your friends in a duel with the same mechanics as previously mentioned, things get competitive very fast, so watch out!  We also have an online multiplayer options available, however there were no players online every time I checked so I would class this as a no go zone.The graphics are a very simplistic style, which actually have a nice look to them; this is the type of game that doesn't need fancy textures and shadows to make it more appealing, as you hardly pay any attention to the graphics due to how fast paced the gameplay is. The single player mode of Nidhogg is about two hours long, so if you are purely looking for a single player experience, this may not be for you since there is not much replay-ability for single player. If you have friends who you can hook up a second controller with, Nidhogg really shines there. The majority of my time on Nidhogg was spent in a local multiplayer mode and it's an absolute blast.Whilst I think the price of £10,99 is quite steep for this game given the lack of single player and online multiplayer content available, the amount of fun you can have in local multiplayer redeems it slightly. So I am going to recommend Nidhogg, but only when it is on sale for anything under £5.  This is certainly a game I will be keeping installed for when friends come round. Tom's Score Card1) Stay away 2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must play

												It's funny and competitive. No other game lets you that much control over your sword. The fighters are nimble, and the controls are smooth. As much as it's amazing when playing with someone, it's boring alone, and the online is dead. Buy it only if you have IRL friends. Also, to play only in short game sessions.			",102,55,0,10,19,1,13

												This game is so simple and silly, it reminds me of the 1v1 play sessions as a kid in my pajamas with my best friends fighting over the controller.Best way to enjoy the game:- Invite people over (blackmail them if they don't want to come)- Boot Nidhogg and shove a controller in their hands- Give them a minute to figure out the controls- Scream ""PREPARE TO DIE""- Win- Repeat until tournament is complete			",34,2,3,3,2,1,4

												I love this game, I love it soo much. But I'm nearly very close to giving it a thumbs down due to the somewhat buggy gameplay and shallow content. I have played this game extremely competitively and have a current record of 9:11, and from that 27 hour experience I can say I've speculated about every mechanic in this game down the very brim and have noticed extremely miniscule mistakes in the programming. This game needs to be more polished. Thank you. 7 / 10			",482,85,5,41,50,2,35

												This game is a work of art.  Definitely a masterpiece.  The swordplay is very interesting and different from many other games.The online multiplayer, however, is severely broken.  There is currently no indication that the developer intends to fix the problem, yet they are offering a 2-pack purchase option.Even if online multiplayer was working properly, even with the unique gameplay, the price seems far too high for the tiny amount of content this game provides.  You can ""beat"" this game and see everything it has to offer in less than 30 minutes.  For the same amount of money you can find many, many other high quality games on Steam that will provide more fulfilling experiences.			",547,135,27,46,46,5,51

												Fun bag of chips type game.  Okay at parties, not much else.  Even at parties it won't be the life of the party, but it might have a couple good bites.  If you get it free or super cheap it's reasonably fun.It is absurdly overpriced though.  Also the online netcode is/was awful, leading to less people online and thus worse ping and a worse experience and ability to troubleshoot in a vicious cycle.  Do not expect online to be fun other than to laugh at the jankiness.I am not recommending this game only because of the price point.  If you can get it for a buck or two, then fine.  Otherwise spend your money on something better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												4 years in development, reviews scoring it 9/10, many ""indie"" awards won...Yet this is a game that barely works, and SOME bugs were fixed literally 22 months later after its release. It's a good local-multiplayer game for breaks don't get me wrong, but it is sadly full of issues.-Terribly overpriced: very basic gameplay in 4 maps for 15 euros. Steam Workshop would have been great...-Bad netcode: do you know the feeling of waking up from bed, only to realize it was just a dream and find yourself back in bed? Yeah, same feeling. I would not recommend this game if you plan on playing online, friends included.-(Keyboard) controls: everytime I launch the game my mapped controls go back to default. Also I have yet to know which button is used to select options in the pause screen. Controls during gameplay are fine, though.-It's supposed to be a competitive game, but it is overall so shallow, monotonous... It makes you close the game AND wish it could have more content at the same time.			",366,44,32,18,32,5,30

												This is certainly one of my favourite local multiplayer games. Although it's 2 player, this actually works in its favour as it means you can have a great game with a smaller group than many local multiplayer titles, and it's so fun to watch that it works well with spectators.From a small series of moves, Nidhogg produces often hilarious fencing moments, either from daring displays of skill or comical misjudgements resulting in failure. I'd like to see more environments in this game, but it remains a great one to have in a collection to pull out when you've got guests over and there's a bit of a lull.			",108,67,0,14,20,1,35

												Very fun game but the multiplayer netcode is awful. Don't expect to play this with anyone who isn't local.edit: Part of my problem was I had some minor packet loss. After this was fixed it went from unplayable to not bad.I still don't think it is great netcode but its not as awful as I had originally seen. My friend and I could play it together but there were a lot of times where it made no sense (someone would die but the other player was too far away to kill them). Its not great with latency, so if you and your friend are not in the same country I wouldn't even bother with multiplayer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You fight, yet you do not fight. This is a dance, one of death, and of desperation. It is a series of brief, brutal, yet exceptionally precise fights, which spin out into a tug of war woven over various arenas. You roll, you kick, you throw your sword, you panic, you grab the ledge and haul yourself up, you knock your foe down, you grab your sword. You kill him.He respawns ten feet away.This pattern repeats, music constantly shifting with the feet, and on occasion terrain of the landscape upon which you fight. In castles, upon clouds, in dungeons, with lava erupting behind you. A constant barrage of visual information, yet your duellist is kept simple, a monotone duellist with a white sword, and his movements are slick, precise and razor sharp. You move, he twitches, he adjusts his sword with a tap of the key, he lunges, he riposts, he rolls, he grabs his foe and kills him in a bloody manner. He runs forward.Then he gets eaten by a worm. WINNER.This is not a game you win. This is a game you play, and you perfect. The art is the fencing, everything else is just icing on the deliciously precise cake. Dark Souls pared down to it's most barest of essentials, fighting games without their glitz, a relentless focus on two things : You. Your sword.Are you quick enough? No. Be quicker. Be better. Respawn. Try it again. Die. Respawn. Again.Welcome to Nidhogg.			",1647,571,92,264,280,18,321

												Before yoy read my review for this game, I'd like you to look at my hours, yes, 2 hours. However, I played this game in offline mode, alot, and because of steam then, it never recorded my hours, I have tried co op with a friend of mine, so I at least have perspective on this.-You may now read the review! :DNow, to be fair, I DID have fun playing this game. Sure, at first glace it just looks like a simple game; but while the controls are very simple, the actual combat is extremly complex (stabbing, hand to hand, throwing, catching, etc). To put it simply, it's generally a good game, it's fair, it's fun, and it is very challenging to keep you interested if you're into this. Overall, I'd say for this genre of fighting games, it's perfect. But you look above and see the thumbs Doooown. Two main reasons.1. If you are not really into fighting game, but you do enjoy them, then it seems perfect to get this game; don't. Honestly, the game doesn't give that much content, there are only 4 levels in the game, which is understandable, since the actual level design is marvelous, but for most people who play fighting game, they want levels where you can perform combos and such; where in Nidhogg; it's not about combos, but about speed; so really, this game ISN'T under most fighting game genres. To put it short; it's just generally not a fighting game; it's just a game of tag, with swords.2. The price; even if you are into this game, and the game alone, honestly, for 15 bucks, I could buy the binding of isaac for 5 dollars, and get about 10 times the amount of content in this, I'm not even kidding. Isaac aside; there isn't much play value if you don't have a controller (Sure, you can play without the controller, but it's extremly awkward using the keyboard at once when you are in a really tense situation); and even if you do, you'd probably get about 15 hours worth, before you and your friend gets bored entirely. While the game is VERY well made with excellent work, I'd only get this game during a sale; to me, the game is worth about 6 dollars at the most.One thing I would like to note that, this is simply my opinion, because alot of people in the review section have good points about the game, if possible, give this game a go, it didn't satify my tastes, but it certinly did for alot of other people. So who knows, maybe you'll be that badass ninja guy who can throw his sword like a boomerang, and kill 2 guys in a single swing. Who knows!			",165,38,0,17,16,2,5

			Fight! We've survived a duel to the death to bring you our review of Nidhogg. Narrated by: Josh Script by: Val and Josh Please like and subscribe for more reviews, gameplay, and discussions!		

While many wait for the next big title, smaller indie games fill the gaps within the major AAA releases. Among these titles is Nidhogg from developer Messhof. At first glance the portrait displayed isn't anything that would take a spot in a respectable museum but take another look and the fine details may surprise you. Nidhogg's image may not be of this generation or the last few for that matter but for all it's simplicity does its transcend to the height of AAA titles?	Focused on it's combat Nidhogg offers very little in content, the single player consists of dueling several enemies within the four available stages in side-scrolling fashion. The goal is the same throughout, make it across to the opposite end whist in numerous duels of death. The respawns are unlimited but once either makes it across 3 screens the game is over and the victor is eaten by the Nidhogg, the world tree chomping worm of Norse mythology.	If there is anything that Nidhogg does extremely well is its combat, the intricate system requires quick reflexes, perfect timing and finesse. Considering the simple premise, the multitude of stances and moves offer up a good amount of depth.  Duels expanding across the pixilated canvas aren't uncommon and it's a testament to how deep the combat is. Stage hazards do play their role but in the end the better fighter will come out on top. It's any easy game to get into and one that offers up some intense moments with duels reaching ridiculous heights. 	Without a doubt the visuals of Nidhogg are not the main attraction, it's sprite based aesthetics do enough to portray the environments and figures throughout the world. Though limited the end result gives Nidhogg some visual charm and identity. Seeing the floor and walls painted with the players matter is chuckle worthy and a nice touch displaying the chaos among adversaries. 	However, the small amount of stages leaves much to desire, considering how simple the levels are it's hard to imagine why any DLC has not been introduced. Stages present little in the imagination department with minimal inspiration. In light of how much was presented in the combat one would imagine a larger emphasis in the level design to promote replayability. 	Nidhogg's multiplayer is crippled by the absence of any online lobby system that could in fact strengthen the competitive mode drastically. The limited online mutliplayer consist of single encounters unless played locally via the bracket based tournament mode. The idea behind the mode is brilliant but why it isn't available online is a major misstep in the design. 	Nidhogg is a charming experience that could of been greater if not for it's lack in content and multiplayer options. The simple to execute yet deep combat system is offset by many other flaws in design. Nidhoggs first attempt has the most important aspect of any game of this style right, it may be completely lacking in narrative but definitely a game made for competitive multiplayer. Playing with some buds is fun and Nidhogg does a great job with contact kills allowing you to embellish every neck break or impalement of a friend.  It's simple, stupid, and addicting fun.  Pick it up on a sale, the asking price might be a bit steep for the short but humorous experience.+Great Combat+Unique Identity+The Nidhogg has no Mercy-Lack of online options and lobbies-Cloud stage is weak-Lag can be an issue-Flat soundtrack6.9 ",133,10,1,4,3,0,6

												My first online match had me cackling with glee. Fast paced fencing! You can change from low, mid, high stances plus you can hold up to throw your sword in a last ditch effort. It's the most fun I've had in an arcade style game in a very long time. Don't let the simple graphics fool you, there's a very well thought out combat system here. You win a round and then try to advance screens in your direction so if you want to try to avoid combat after you win a round you can be a coward and beeline for the finish. Ok, enough typing, I have fast paced fencing to get to.			",340,81,29,16,32,3,14

												Give me a moment here, I want to make sure I don't miss any of these. Ahem:•	WINNER: Indiecade Game Design, 2013•	WINNER: IGF | GDC Nuovo Award, 2011•	WINNER: Eurogamer Expo, RPS Indie Game of the Show, 2010•	WINNER: Fantastic Arcade Excellence in Design, 2010•	WINNER: Fantastic Arcade Bloodsport of the Year: 2010•	FINALIST: IGF | GDG Excellence in Design, 2011•	FINALIST: IGF | GDC Grand Prize, 2011Those are the nominations and awards the newly released indie fighter, Nidhogg has listed on their home page. It was enough to make me pick it up without hesitation.I don't often define the quality of a video game by how many awards it's won, but when I start losing the ability to count them on my hands, apparently I do. A good thing, too. Nidhogg is all kinds of awesome.A DUEL TO THE DEATHThe concept is remarkably simple: 2 players go head-to-head in a half duel/half race to the death, both equipped with fencing swords and capable of more than a few tricks to give an edge in battle. You begin facing your opponent in the 'middle' of a map, with an opening battle. Battles are fast and furious beyond imagining, often ending within a few seconds, which ties into the gameplay mechanic wonderfully: upon killing your opponent they'll need to wait a moment to respawn, allowing you to press forward toward your 'goal'. Win a battle and you're given the 'goal light' allowing you to move forward further; lose, and your opponent gains it instead. So long as you maintain the previous kill you can pass-by your opponent without engaging and edge closer to your goal - should they fail to stop your approach.This 'tug-o-war' mechanic is the single most endearing indie game element I've felt in a while. It's relentless, and the feeling of achievement after finally managing to push an opponent back to the end, before summarily being eaten by Nidhogg, is one of much glory and admiration. Simple, sure. But so very, very rewarding. Easy to learn, too, and likely near-impossible to master.MATCH MADE IN HELLSingle-Player Mode consists of fighting steadily more challenging opponents, one after another, on one of 4 maps. So, naturally, if you want to be playing Nidhogg for more than a few hours, you're going to need to go multiplayer.Sadly, the online matchmaking within Steam isn't great. Assuming you can actually find a game, there's a good chance one of you will be lagging horribly — and when you're playing the type of game that you can't play with even the slightest amount of lag, matches can often lead to aggravating experiences. Assuming you have a few friends playing, and you're all within the same global region, this won't be a huge problem. And if you're lucky enough to have more than a few friends playing, then Tournament Mode will likely give you the greatest experience of all. I know, personally, playing live on Twitch, that this feature will make for 99% of all my time playing. WORTH A BUY?At $15~ I can only recommend a purchase here for players with friends planning to play with them - for now, at least. Which is largely a shame, as the gameplay offered in Nidhogg is truly exceptional.Possible improvements include visual upgrades to characters to simulate some form of character progression; as it stands, every game is the same and with 4 maps there's limited variety. You'll be relying on your opponents to entertain you; if they do, you're going to love Nidhogg, if not, you're likely going to get very bored, very quick.ABOUT THE AUTHORCody Hargreaves, better known as  Excessive Profanity[twitch.tv], has been writing reviews and articles in the gaming industry for 7 years, across various websites and publications.

												While by modern standards Nidhogg is minimalistic in both features and aesthetic, the joy and entertainment derived from gradually learning its frenetic, deliberate, and simple combat system is enough for me to consider this one of the best indie fighting games I've ever played. Though it is admittedly lacking in level or character selection, what's present is beautifully realized, from the abstract woodland creatures gambolling in the tall grass to the vortex of light pulsing behind cloud bridges. The soundtrack, while only comprised of four tracks, is perfectly suited to the technicolor slaughter.The game offers online play, but I would only recommend this if you're planning to joust in-person. Any amount of latency would kill the pinprick precision integral to the swordplay. Like any good fighting game, the best part is learning and adapting with each match, and there's little else sweeter than witnessing your opponent wince and hearing the spectators clamor after a meticulously-timed riposte (or a rude and random divekick, whatever works). It succeeds equally well as both a cuthroat, competitive tournament game and a night drinking's casual diversion.			",31,11,0,4,2,0,2

												Short and Sweet Version:  This game is very basic.  You try to go one way, the other guy the other way.  The controls aren't nearly as tight as I would like them (or perhaps too tight?).  And the sound track to doing this back and forth non-sense is very repetitive and uninspiring.  The sounds are about what you'd expect, but perhaps a grade below that and the gameplay, although as responsive (sometimes, sometimes not) is about what you'd expect.I would price this title at $3.  If you spend any more than that, you'll feel as cheated as I currently do.Overall - very disappointed for what I paid for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If you're in the same room, you can play on the same keyboard or have someone on the keys and the other on a gamepad. The controls are easy to pick up, but the gameplay is just so addictive. Can't beat the feeling of disarming the other guy and watching the spray of pixels when you poke him. It's more than a simple fencing game. It's a back and forth struggle full of swordplay, chases, and satisfying comebacks.			",73,17,4,5,6,0,2

												In short, a game of tug-o-war with a variation. A neat side scroll-er with a simple game play idea and graphic. Nidhogg with wonderful controller support is a game that mirrors fencing and you must defeat your opponent and advance to the next stage. When you defeat an opponent, you only have so much time to run to the next stage before he reincarnates. The controllers are simple which include hitting an opponents body or head... and if you catch their swords on an up sweep you can disarm them. You also have the ability to throw your sword. It's a neat game, it's fun for what it is, but the fun doesn't last extremely long. Only reason I got it was it was listed as local co-op. I'll recommend it but with caution.RATING : 6.75/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign N/A Visuals / User Interface C+ Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ ",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

												This game is very well-made. I say this because it requires skill to play, is fast-paced, has wonderful backgrounds, and simply has an interesting and fun concept behind it. It's also very satisfying to fake out your opponent with a tricky sword maneuver and jam a rapier through his head. Additionally, the soundtrack is phenomenal! However, the replayability of the game is limited, as there are only four maps and the online multiplayer is a bit rough around the edges (it's much better and more responsive while playing local multiplayer or singleplayer), and once you beat the singleplayer campaign you need friends who enjoy playing it as much as you do. Overall, I would highly recommend this game, as it is entertaining, satisfying, and while it is easy to learn, it is difficult to master (but very rewarding when you get it down pat). I actually have more hours on record than Steam reports I do, because I've played it on a different computer and the transfer of playtime between computers was not very good; I have about 10 hours more than the amount shown above invested in this game, and I still play it and recommend it heartily. Well worth the money, and well worth the time you'll spend playing it.			",112,9,1,9,9,1,5

												Right now, not worth the price, at all.  The game isn't even true 16x9 widescreen, game has unexplainable lagspikes on my brand new 700 series GPU Gaming Laptop.  And the combat itself feels more frantic and ""beat to the punch"" based than actual super fast paced methodical skill-based combat.  Has good ideas, and my opinions can change on the complexity and eventual mastery, but right now it's just ""feels"" too frenetic to be any real skill-based 3rd Strike (if you will) type gameplay.  So it's a good pick up and play game.  Soundtrack wise, it leaves a lot to be desired.  nothing really to say there, nothing is really good at all...Visually, it's a minimalist type paintery style, sort of, but I don't particularly think it excentuates the raw gameplay as much as another artstyle could.  But heh, it's unique, and it looks alright.  Multiplayer should be fun at least.  Anyway, just my first impressions.  But definitely not worth a $15 pricetag imo, much better games at cheaper or exactly that price.  And Volgarr The Viking remains the undisputed king of recent Indie games recently with Race The Sun at #2 imo.  So anyway, yeah, 7/10 if you want a score.			",904,208,20,81,42,4,69

												I have a about an hour or two in this game, but don't let that discourage you. GAMEPLAY: Niddhog has very good gameplay, easy to learn but difficult to master at its finest. You hold your rapier in three positions, low, mid, and high. You can strike from any of these positions, and if you hit your opponent who is at the same guard as your attack, it'll be parried. Moving your blade up/down onto your opponent's guard will also disarm them. You can throw your rapier, do a jump-kick, and do a sweep while crouched. You can also roll on the ground, which has the implication of rolling under a high-guard and getting behind your opponent. Overall, the combat is good. Also, each unique stage has special areas and can be used to your advantage. Such as the cloud level where you can fall down if you don't move. GRAPHICS: The graphics, although ""pixellated"", are aesthetically pleasing. However this is where the game starts to fall. The second ""cloud"" level, is very, very bright and flashes very fast. I'm not epileptic, but I was straining to see in this level and I have no idea how an epileptic would deal with it. But otherwise they're good. COMMUNITY: Now here's where the game falls apart further. It has a good, active community. However this is useless as the netcode for the game literally doesn't work. There is no online play, so you can only play locally/LAN. A game that'd otherwise have a very long life is made a gimmick because of this. There are no multiplayer tournaments, matches with friends, or community events. In this sense, the game's simplicity kills itself as it doesn't last when playing alone. The game is good, but I can't recommend it. Due to the non-existant support post-launch, the broken netcode, and lack of news about the game gives it a bleak future. 5/10, good game but it's average.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: September 25, 2014
												I really WANTED to like this game. I'd heard such great things about it, and it seemed like it should be right up my alley. Unfortunately, it was just let down.First, the gameplay. Nidhogg has simple but slightly awkward controls that certainly can be mastered but aren't particularly fluid on their own. If you're expecting fighting-game style precision, you're going to be disappointed. Once you get past the tutorial, the movement options feel fuzzy and unreliable. The basic combat is... okay. Most actions happen so quickly that it's humanly impossible to react to them, so it's mostly about anticipation and taking risks, and be prepared for a number of frustrating deaths where it doesn't even look like you were touched by the opponent's sword.I realize that everything I just wrote is directly contrary to what most other critics are saying about the game, but I can only call it like I see it. I've played plenty of other games in this niche, and they all felt better than Nidhogg.The one place where the game is fun is local co-op, which is the entire point of the game I suppose, but it's fun for the ""wrong"" reasons. Playing with a group of friends makes all of the ""screw you, that was stupid"" moments fun, because you  all get to taunt each other the whole time. So basically, the game is fun with friends precisely *because* of the stupid and lopsided moments that in any other situation would just be frustrating.Claims that the game's graphics are ""beautiful"" are overstated. There are one or two impressive setpieces that will probably catch your eye, but the game as a whole isn't particularly nice-looking. The style is unique and expressive, but it's not objectively pleasing by any measure. Also, the game really needs a colorblind setting, because my character is practically invisible to me against the backdrop of the second stage.My final complaint, which others have echoed, is that there's not nearly enough content to justify the $15 price tag. I normally don't mind paying a little extra for a good game, but this is definitely more of a $5 title. If it's on sale for that much and you're looking for a new game to play at parties, maybe this is for you, but otherwise you're not missing much by passing it up.			",218,41,1,27,19,2,34

												First things first:This is a party-game, meaning it´s supposed to be played with many people on a couch, screaming, laughing. Think Smash Bros, Towerfall, Samurai Gunn, etc. Don´t fret though because the game does have online multiplayer.The simple goal of Nidhogg is to get into the endzone, that´s it. Too bad your opponent has the exact same goal.What ensues is a glorious tug of war, because who ever got the last kill is the only one who can proceed. And killing there will be lots of, because besides being a race for the goal, Nidhogg also excells at being a Prince of Persia-style fencing game. Although appearing rather simple, the fighting system is pretty deep and complex with parries, blocks, feints, jumps, rolls, wallmoves, different attack stances, you can even throw your blade at your opponent. All of this lightning-fast action is presented in a very stylized fashion, reminescent of the good old days of the Commodore 64 and it fits the game perfectly. Animations are fluent (and very gory in a cartoony way), backgrounds are very retro and sometimes deliberately convoluted or hard to see your character in. Though featuring only 4 Stages on the date of this review, it´s more than enough to get going and further deepens the Retro-Arcady-Feel of this game (yes, leaving things out can actually give a product more character rather than taking it away)Sound and music are nothing to write home about but they get the job done with little screams and clangs here and there.Nidhogg is a game it would definetely reccomend if you grew up with titles like Barbarian, International Karate (Karateka) or even the wonderful Moonstone (which NEEDS a remake). It´s fast, deep, satisfying, a definite skill- AND mindgame when it comes to the fencing. People looking for a lot of content and fancy graphics will surely be turned off by this game but tournament-fighters and retro-fans should try it.One final word about the pricing, I can understand that 11 bucks (or how much that may be in $) is a steep price but devs gotta live too and I´m sure it will be in a sale sooner or later. So consider helping the guys (the guy?) from Messhoff out by getting it right now!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would recommend this game if the devs would ever fix the netcode. Whoever is hosting the match gets priority. Good luck being able to jump at all if you're not the host. It seems they've abandoned updating altogether. As a single player game, it's fun but it gets redundant fast. This game would only be worth it if you can do local multiplayer. At least this game has that.			",257,40,2,11,11,0,5

												 I just had a five minute one-on-one duel with a random person.  It can be ♥♥♥♥in’ INTENSE.  You can die and respawn as many times as you like.  The goal is to get to the end of the level in whatever direction you have to go, right for me, left for him.  Stab, jump, kick, punch your way through him.  Even if the game ends up with him almost winning, you can push your way back to your end of the level just because it becomes so nerve racking for the other person that a chance for you to push back opens up and you make a mad dash for the right side of the screen.  The battle wages on room through room, back and forth.  Orange and Yellow blood bathes the floor while sword upon sword exchange hands as they are thrown through the air.  A lucky stab in the face brings your opponent’s hands to your sword as you stand still for but a moment, the character grasping at the sword.  You thrust forward and the color orange floods the floor below.  You run forward.  He spawns in the doorway ahead of you.  You can’t throw your sword.  You have to charge him.  You see that he has put his sword just too high.  You charge.  You duck and roll all the way through the doorway and stand and stab him in the back.  You keep running.  He spawns again, this time getting a lucky sword throw to your face.  Lives are traded.  you finally make it to the next room.  You are beating him.  This is your territory.  The ground is clean of blood and swords.  you charge.  he spawns just before a pit and makes a nervous jump, falling to his doom.  You laugh!  You wait for him to respawn as he recollects himself.  You both realize that that pitfall was a mistake.  An honorable man lets your opponent have a fair fight.   You beat him.  As he dissolves in to orange goo behind you, you run for the final screen.  You make it.The screen flares up in brilliant red as the sky catches fire.  The music picks up.  Everything is waiting for you to make the first move.  You charge.  he spawns.  He knows you could win if you get past him.  You make a jump.  You dive kick in to him.  His sword goes left, his body crumples.  You charge to the right.  he runs to the left, hoping to respawn before you can make it across to the end of the map.  He respawns.He knows your tricks.  he knows you will jump above him as he spawns, sending your foot in to his face.  He is ready.  You know he knows your plans.  You prepare for the inevitable.  There is no time to change plans.  You must act.  You jump.He jumps.One of you will press the kick button at the right time.  If you press it at the wrong time, he will kick you to the ground and rip your proud head off your yellow neck.  You kick.  Your feet meet his feet.  He falls.  You charge.The croud is doing the wave in your favor.  You have done it.  You bow to your opponent.  Your hands are sweating.  You crawl to the finish line, barely able to stand.A giant worm flies towards you.  You are eaten whole.WINNER.			",171,22,5,11,15,1,14

												I will recommend this game for the near perfection of a duel.  It offers strategy, depth, and no overly complex rules.  It's very well put together and can make some amazing situations.As always there are things to watch out for:Technical issues-  These are not too terrible, but be preprared in every 3rd or 4th game to lose or win a fight due to a network hiccup.  As always I assume they'll be fixed as I played this near release.No idea the future:There's no communication on what the future for this game is now. There's a great game here, but all games have room to grow. I have no idea if any improvements are incoming.Complaints I would not worry about from other people.Only 4 maps.  Consider it like a fighting game.  They may have 12 maps, but it's really a background swap.  Here each 4 maps represents a completely different battlefield.  If people clamour that much for more maps they could easily doa pallet swap and call it a day.			",279,39,7,26,29,5,66

If you like PVP at all, and are looking for a game that can be a ton of fun without a big time commitment, you can't go wrong with this.

												If you have some local friends to play with, this game is excellent. The combat is surprisingly deep and even after a few days I still find it really fun to play in a local setting. Spectating people chanting and cheering when someone is disarmed and slain is one of the things that just can't be coded in to the game. Eight player tournaments are also spectacular, but this is an even less likely scenario for most prospective buyers. There is a single player game that is adequate for times where you'd like to play but have no one to play with for the moment, but this mode is not nearly as interesting as battling with other humans.Yes, there is an option to play online. However, online multiplayer still has a lot of issues that seem to vary between being ""fine"" and ""massive desync; abort everything"". It's a shame, but I can't recommend this game that doesn't treat this game as a local multiplayer game the time being. There may be a day where that's untrue, maybe even soon, where it'll be absolutely fine online. Until then, consider this game only if you have at least one other person to play with. If you are willing to slog through some horrible connection problems with some people, there may be some fun matches to have, but the cost-benefit of that could potentially be very low.In short: great game for local multiplayer. Very interesting and fun mechanics. Promising online multiplayer that is currently very unreliable.			",393,100,2,42,33,3,48

												Nidhogg is about competitive dueling. I first played EggNogg that was way more hilarious with the swords bouncing around, so I entered Nidhogg disappointed as it was more 'bland' and the different parts of each level are too short to allow longer play and more frequent comebacks. EggNogg had one single level with more variety inside, while Nidhogg has less variety inside a single level but more variety overall with the different levels and their unique twists (grass field to hide in the Wilds, narrow corridors and moving floor in the Mines, concealing clouds and bright colors in the Clouds, and a few pits plus a big central area in the Castle). I will give something important to Nidhogg over EggNogg though: the controls are more reactive and the game is more balanced. It feels good to play, and it leaves a lot of room for improving skill and reading the moves of the opponent. (Edit: However EggNogg+ now has reactive controls that even includes wall-jumps!)So what else does Nidhogg have? AI players for a single player mode, these opponents are actually quite good and each AI seems to have its own way to fight and unpredictable movements. Good point here. There are nice local multiplayer additions such as an 8 player tournament mode, and the possibility to change the game rules for local 1 on 1.Last but not least, there is an online multiplayer mode. Having friends to play with seems like the only reasonable way, as the matchmaking is literally empty and on the rare occasions that there is someone else playing, expect painful lag as they are likely at the other side of the world.So then, here comes the big question. Why am I not recommending this game? I enjoy playing it, I want it to have more success but.... It took so many years and does not seem polished enough. It is not possible to change the color of the players, my logitech controllers are not recognized by the game, the different areas in each level are too short to allow for more tense play (the central area in the castle is the best place for comebacks and tension building up), the online part of the game has the merit to exist but didn't get enough love, there are no arrows at the start of the game to show who is who, and, for all of that, I find that the game is too expensive for what it is. And apparently I'm not the only one thinking that way, seeing all the comments in the forum and the fact that the online multiplayer is quite empty.I can only recommend this game on sale or if you know you will often have friends over to enjoy the duels. I realize that I am too severe because I probably expected too much and the free game EggNogg biased my judgment a lot, but Nidhogg was around for a long time and the result still lacks polish. Although I guess that it is expensive to compensate for the small niche market. But a fundamental issue for me is the lack of players online, and the insane lag on the rare moments that a player is found (it can even happen often to see the same scene rewind with each time a different player dying, wtf?).

												Entertaining, but the game desperately needs additional features and some bug fixing before I could ever recommend it, or play for more than the odd rare match.  Online multiplayer is incredibly laggy, there is no option for local lan play which I see as a huge omission, there is no way of directly choosing to play with a friend so you can't arrange to play people, and the menus need better mouse support or a different UI entirely.But, the gameplay is there, and that's the biggest hurdle.  The aesthetic is solid, the gamemodes are varied and interesting, it's got most of what it needs to be a good multiplayer game between friends.  It could be lots of fun, if they could make it so you could actually play with those friends without dealing with 20 rounds of matchmaking roulette to get paired and a ruberbanding stuttery mess when you finally play.  It's just pretty hard to actually enjoy the game.  I hope for future updates, but I'm not holding my breath.			",512,150,5,89,66,4,79

												Don't get me wrong, this game *is* fun. However, at full price, in my opinion, it isn't worth it: You need to play multiplayer to have any real enjoymentThe barebones graphics are bland rather than charming, the levels repeat (3 levels)There is an easy exploit (run, roll, strike).If this game *was* $1, it is okay... but I have payed for and played **MUCH** better games at the same price.The positive aspects of this game: The controls (on XBox controller) are *great*!It's great fun to play with a friend (but gets boring quickly)Very cool idea... it just needs more to it. This feels like the base of a greater game. If this game is on sale, and you want a good local multiplayer game to stab your friends with... go for it.However, on it's own, I do not recommend this game.			",344,103,10,51,49,2,56

												Only get this game when it's on sale (-75%)! It's a fun multiplayer game. You can confidently play it during a house party and you'll see that it'll be a hit (though I only did it once since the game ""Broforce"" is much more entertaining at house parties)! Also note that the achievements are very easy to get (except one, which is super hard, bordering on impossible).

												Nidhogg is a small game developed by an indie developer Messhof. While the game isn’t the longest one I have ever played, it is definitely THE best local multiplayer game I have played in a long time. You can literally spend countless hours playing the local multiplayer against your friends. However, if you like to play with your friends, then this game is for you, but if you do not like the local multiplayer, I still recommend that the game is not very long, this needs improvement.In Nidhogg there is only one objective , kill your opponent by out-stabbing them by using only three sets of stances, high, middle and low. While it may sound simple at first, the game is really hard to master, and sometimes it gets a little bit frustrating when you get stabbed couple times in a row. After you kill your enemy you have to run to the right in order to advance to next level, the enemy can do the same thing, the first one being the easiest and the last one. I don’t know what’s the point of that but It’s kind of hilarious and random.As I have said before, the single-player consists of 17 AI opponents, which is great but the same can’t be said about the level variety, there is only 3 or 4 different levels which are re-used during the 17 battles in the single-player. I really wish that there was more variety in level design, maybe we’ll get them in later updates. The art style is what I love the most about this game, the player animations are also worth mentioning because of how smooth and realistic they are, and also it feels really satisfying when you stab someone. On the other hand, the game also has some flaws, one of them is the online multiplayer, it is seriously lacking in features and is very unstable, I kept being disconnected from matches, and I have experienced serious lag during several online matches.
