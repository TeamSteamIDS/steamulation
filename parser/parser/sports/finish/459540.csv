												So in light of all the rampant negativity toward this game, I figured I would talk about it as well. All in all? It's good. Not great. But it's fun and has a lot of charm. The price point is a touch steep for me, and I don't see it having all that much longevity, about 3 hours for a playthrough, or so. Replay value will probably trail off pretty quick, too, as you exhaust the dialogue for the girls you like best.  That in mind, waiting for a sale might not be a bad choice. Still, it's definitely worth playing.Most of the reviews I've seen cite the resolution as a major flaw of the game, and quite frankly that baffles me; not every indie japanese game that barely gets a translation at all can get the Fruitbat treatment. Japanese games don't tend to support higher resolutions. Very often UI elements lock the game to the default resolution. I could see it being an issue if you have a tiny monitor that you're running above its native resolution, but if you happen to be that corner case, you are going to have other problems on a daily basis anyway, resolution of this game being least among them. It might be annoying, sure, but to say it makes it a terrible game by default would be funny if it weren't so sad. The game is perfectly playable as is. Saying it's some sort of criminal cash-grab because they didn't add higher resolution support is... bizarre. Additionally I see a lot of complaints about a lack of transparency in the combat system, and enemy cards with low numbers frequently beating cards with higher numbers. This is because, as the game points out in both the tutorial and the tips section, card value is not the only determinant of victory. The number next to the move in your move list is also a major determining factor. If you have a punch card with a value of five for instance, and pick a level 5 punch, it will lose to an opponent with a level 2 card. The phrasing in the tutorial could probably be clearer, but the tips section explains it rather plainly. If you don't understand the mechanics and yet you haven't bothered to look at the freely accessible help section, that is not necessarily the game's fault.The game has a high amount of luck involved, but like any game that involves rolling dice, the strategy lies in minimizing the amount you have to rely on it. Choose skills that do so. And finally, I've seen a lot of complaints about how the game has ironman mode on at all times. Just back up your save if you don't want an engaging and tense experience. Seriously I've never seen so many people PC Master Race so hard about resolution without knowing how to PC.Now that that rant about how to play the game is out of the way, the game does have its fair share of problems. While the references were initially endearing, they're so constant throughout that it starts to grate after a while. ""Oh. The girl with a stand made another Jojo reference. How unexpected.""The inability to check what a character's moves do if she's not in your team is also brutal. While I could see it being because in reality you wouldn't know what these moves are if you don't know the girl, it's rather frustrating in a gameplay environment, especially when the AI obviously has no such disadvantage.The tutorial is a bit vague, and some of the wordings (particularly on the card value and move value subject) could use some clarification, and while the tips section helps, it doesn't explain everything (lax or strict club environments? That one i have only guesses on). There are useful tips on loading screens, but with no easy way to view all of them at once, it's not the best way to present that information. Additionally, some NPCs around the school will give ""useful"" advice, but since you have to spend AP to even wander the school, these conversations are a frustrating waste of money rather than actually helpful most of the time. The art is quite nice, though. Combat portraits and everyday portraits are both very high quality, although the difference in style can be a bit jarring in some cases. Character writing is also quite wonderful as far as the girls I've seen, Liling best girl, though that might be heavily to taste. Several characters fell a little flat for me, though that too may just be taste in archetypes.Overall feels like the hate is unwarranted. People's main complaint being the resolution ought to make that obvious anyway.			",263,70,2,54,45,1,48

												I tried to like this game, I really did. The art is great, the sound is decent and upbeat. The resolution didn't bother me and I don't care about saving.However, this game has a combat system that is punishing, random, and lacks transparency. I can forgive a game for any one of those three, but games--like this one--that combine the three are not fun. Combat is punishing. Mistakes incur devastating penalties.Combat is random. Each round you are given 5 random cards, each of which has a rank from 1-5 and an attack type (punch, kick, throw, etc). It sounds intriguing, but then the reality of RNG stes in: your boxer--who only deals damage with one of the 6 card--may *easily* go 5 rounds in a row without drawing a card that permits you to use a punch. IF you do get a card that permits a punch, it may then be a rank so low that the attack will fail. Combine that with the devastating penalties, and you have numerous occasions where the game gives you the illusion of choosing your attacks, but the underpinning gameplay reality is that all your choices result in failure. Combat is not transparent. It isn't clear what moves win and when they win. What is clear is that the CPU opponent will always win ties. Sometimes, the CPU will use a low ranked card and higher ranked card will still lose; this would be okay if your lower ranked card sometimes won. They don't, and you get no explanation why.There are so many great games available on Steam that I feel cheated when a belligerent developer insists on this type of bad gameplay and poor instructions. Stay away from this game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game had a few mixed reviews here on Steam, so I was hesitant to buy it, even on sale. I'm glad I did, though, as this game is a lot of fun. The developers must have paid attention to the reviews about the resolution and full screen mode, as these features have been changed now and I ran the game beautifully in full screen. I found the tutorials and the tip pages to be just fine in teaching me how to play the game. Sure, the systems aren't fully transparent, but that would take the fun out of the game if they were. Part of the challenge and enjoyment of this game is trying to figure out what works best in combat and training. There is a learning curve, and you should expect to lose a few matches (or even lose the game on your first play through.) If everything was handed to you right away it wouldn't be any fun.I will admit the random card values and odd tiebreak system did upset me from time to time. While it may seem like the computer wins ties more often, if you play enough you will see it does even out. Unfortunately, I hated when the rng failed me. My first playthrough I was in the finals and both teams were down to a single girl. My girl was half health and the opponent was at a sliver. My three highest cards were all 4s, and my opponent got all 5s, and I lost. Fortunately, the game autosaves before the final so you can replay those as much as you need to in case you get hosed by the rng. I think the replay factor on this game is great. There are a ton of combinations of girls to choose from, and each has a wide variety of moves they could learn. With the numerous strategies for training, coordinating the girls, and leanring moves, I'm excited to play through a few more times to see which strategy can work the best.I got this on sale ($11) and I think it was a great deal at that price. I may not  have tried it at the full $15, but even at that price it would still be a decent game.			",15,6,0,14,12,1,10

												Has potential but suffers from bad RNG and mediocre instructions.Essentially Female Fight Club with card battles.EDIT: Full Screen Resolution has been added. Game autosaves beginning of each day. Tested by closing the game mid-day.For fans of Cherry Tree High, you'll be happy to see two returning characters from the main cast.Art is a significant step up from CTHCC and CTHCC My Girls.Pleasant sound with each character having a theme, and plenty of dialogue per character to give some personality.You assemble a team of 3 fighters, each of whom has an introductory dialogue.Unfortunately, you're forced to recruit the character once you speak to them. A bit of a bummer, but you do get a brief background on the character and fighting style before you make the choice.The game is broken out into Monday-Friday weeks, with Monday-Thursday being a stat sim and Friday being the weekly fighting competition.One major flaw is the limited instructions. The ingame tips and stat screen cover the basics of how to raise your fighters and combat, but not much else.The lack of stat values on moves is especially frustrating. It was a process of trial-and-error before finally settling on using certain moves.Most of my success in the campaign came from abusing Unblockables, Numbing (stun effect), and just brute forcing it with Asuka (STR build).Overall, it was enjoyable, but this is as a fan of CTHCC and someone who likes stat sims/card battles.Resolution lock and manual save weren't a deal breaker, but can be annoying.You have to save by going to Settings (ingame) and return to the Title Screen.Surprisingly, this game does not have a New Game Plus like CTHCC.EDIT: The game saves topics unlocked through playthroughs. At its worst, the game feels like a rush to min/max your characters while trying to figure out how the combat system works.Characters heavily favor certain move types, so it's better to specialize rather than make a jack-of-all trades.It takes a significant amount of training to force a character to excel elsewhere.With a better guide and more forgiving RNG, this could be substantially better.The characters and aesthetics were definitely charming, and the story, albeit odd at the end, was pleasant enough.A nice touch is the first girl you pick gets an extra epilogue conversation.

												If there's one thing i could say about the game it's that this would undoubtedly be perfect for the iOS as it works wonderfully as a time killing card battle game and i could see many other's being able to get into it even more strongly on that platform.While the tutorial doesn't do well to explain the mechanics of the game very clearly i was able to easily figure my way around having played many card games of a similar nature in the past so found myself able to soar through my playthrough with fair ease on normal mode and overall found this one quite enjoyable!One of my favourite features was getting to talk to the girl's and getting to know them individually, over the course of the game you can unlock 'topics' and interact with them during certain periods using 10 AP, When exiting the game there seems to be special skits where you can see some of the girls from other teams or otherwise interacting or in some cases saying an ending message by their lonesome as was the case of a certain heroine.Other than that it turns out my new kitten really loves this game and puts her paws up on the side of my laptop to watch which is just too precious~ The ost is wonderful and the work the artists did on all the available characters is something to really be admired.

												Hmm, I've only played a little bit. I like the premise, I think I was thinking of the Manwa, Girls of the Wild's.  I want to like this game but it feels a little rushed. I guess I was expecting more pics whether it's the girls or the fight part. Almost feels like early access. Would be nice if they patched some more meat into this game. I guess that's what I'm hoping for so I won't ask for a refund. Just needs more artwork, especially at the beginning, feels a little bare, will try to play more during the weekend. And yeah, better save ability pls. I've heard that this is a case of you get what you pay for, so impress me with an extremely good dlc worth buying if your not gonna add more to the game.  I guess I want to reluctantly recommend since I'm hoping for more.			",112,36,2,68,17,0,36

												First let me state: I like the game being at 800x600 windowed, and not being able to manually save means very little.So why can't I recommend this game? Glaring combat issues. Your available actions are dictated by RNG, and there outcomes also seem to be dictated by RNG sometimes, but you don't know for sure, because the game doesn't explain $#!7. You get punished for not making mistakes, while the AI just does stupid things while you sit back and can't punish them because of how combat works. It's entirely unfun, and honestly frustrating at times.			",36,9,3,11,24,0,20

												I really wanted to like this one, I really did. I just can't believe this game was made by the same people who made the other CTH games.I loved Cherry Tree High Comedy Club, that game really made me laugh sometimes. Cherry Tree High My Girls unfortunately removed the recruitment system but the dialogue was atleast just as funny as the first game.But THIS... this game has none of the appeal of the previous games, the characters feel like carbon cut-outs they aren't interesting or realistic they're just there, even the best characters from the previous games are now written like insignificant NPC characters (even in the first game the NPC felt alive and like real people.)And now for the gameplay, the idea isn't that bad but has been executed horribly. You basically pick three girls and train them for the weekly battle against another girls fight team, but I feel you get way too little time to train for the first fight and training your characters and watching them fight just isn't fun, it's not just that you hardly do something. That isn't necessarly a problem but if you're forced to watch something boring. I.E watching lifeless characters fight and train and give the most basic response to the results (With zero personality) yes then it's a problem. You can also walk around the school during your free 4 days before the fight this takes CP but it doesn't even feel worth it because then you have to listen to the boring and uninpired NPC characters talk so that you have a conservation topic for your for when you want to talk to your boring and uninspired girls-fight members. (NEVER)It's just such a disappointment playing this game after the great first two CTH games, this game just doesn't have the charm of these games. So even if you're a fan of the series I just can't recommend it, just play the other CTH games those are great and I hope we get a sequel to those in the style of the first one one day.

												This game is interested concept and characters are cute, but interfaces and systems are inconvenient to me.First, res is 800x600 only.Second, Other unicode is not playable, except English and Japanese.So I had to play with NTLEA programs that help can't play set unicode.My playtime is marked about 20 minute, but actually I am played this gameabout 1~2 hours with NTLEA.Third, Battle system is depend on random and don't need to thinking about tactics. I did select higher card and higher skill only, because battle system is too simple to think.Forth, this company is do not fix often. I searched other games that was made this companyand saw that's record of patches.  So I think game is not better soon.Character's are cute, and Concept developing my team is well done. But this game is need that battle systems more addictable and Configurations are more comfortable.I am really like anime-like game(not Visual novel) but had no choice but to refund to these fault reasons.If it is fix many things, I am gladly repurchase this.

												The game looks charming. I'll give it that.However, there is no proper tutorial, meaning you can't play the game. You have no idea how to win, why cards that seem like they would win lose, and everything just seems completely random no matter what you do. If you were to have a tutorial, maybe you would actually know what's happening. I mean seriously, this is the only game I've ever played without a proper tutorial to explain anything...For context, I believe the first line of their ""manual"" is ""Draw cards and win games."" This was pretty much suppose to teach you how to play. (Edit: Also, about 3/4 of the manual is just talking about status conditions, again, nothing about how anything works.)I wasn't sure how to save or when the game saved either. Not really helpful.So yeah, definite pass on this one, unless you just like clicking random stuff without knowing what it does.			",62,22,0,28,9,0,18

												 So I'm away from my home, and my computer, only pc I have is lenovo thinkpad t510 which is ancient, and I needed some game to pass some time, then this game draw my interest. Game seems decent as far as I can say atm, it reminded me Fight Club, but more like kawaii anime style, with anime girls and some VN elements. You train your girl based on their styles and teams needs every day, then you fight at weekends. You talk with your girls to keep them motivated and find topics to talk by walking around the school.  Fighting system seems bit complicated atm, I'm trying to figure out the system, but basicly, every move has it's genre(kick, punch, ki, rush, throw, grab). They come to you as cards while fighting turn based fight. Cards comes with values from 1 to 5 and the highest valued card wins that round. Each round both fighter uses 3 cards and they start to fight when you pick 3 cards.  I'll add more as I explore.			",204,27,1,45,17,0,17

 I really wanted to like this game, I liked the idea a lot! Unfortunately it just feels cheap for a 2016 game.You can only play in a  800 x 600 window, can't put it full screen. The artwork is great, and the characters all have cool looks to it, but the little window kind of ruins that, you don't have any other options.Furthermore, there are no voices at all, which is really unfortunate.The game play itself feels lacking. You pick a group of 3 fighters out of 15 to form your team, you don't get to speak to them first to decide which to take. Then it's basically a training manager. Each day you pick a training regimen, they do it, and at the end of the week, you fight another team. The fighting seems really RNG based... you just hope to draw strong cards.I liked the idea and I liked the characters, but the game was really lacking ~ ",1248,602,35,110,186,11,171

												Many people rated thisgame negative because of resulution and game play.I am playing most of games windowed mode usually so its not a problem for me.Actually gameplay is not hard when you understand mentality. Its like a frp game without a dice.Game had more potencial than current state. Its sad. Art is great, details are good, game play is addictive and fights are fun but still something is missing. First of all story is so weak. Some ways this game very similar with punch club. Rpg elements of puch club is better than cherry tree but cherry trees combat is more fun, deep and strategic. Maybe more animations (fighting and training), deeper story (like diffrent lore for every combatans, we are selecting 3 of them so combinations make more interesting the lore), minigames and side quests did make this game perfect but this is an indie game so i cant aspect high. But still its a pretty good game and worth to play.Tip: All girls have no equal potencial. With training some of them will become overpowered (like Haruno. She is using only Spirit. Its make her easy to train)			",77,26,4,11,9,0,6

												สำหรับซีรีห์ Cherry Tree High 2 ภาคแรกจะเป็นแนว adv กึ่ว simulator ที่เราจะได้เป็นเด็กสาวหาเพื่อนเข้าชมรมในภาค 1 และเป็นไอดอลในภาค 2 ครับ แต่ภาคนี่มาแปลก เราได้เป็น ผจก. ยิมที่ชักจูงเด็กสาว (เลือกได้) เพื่อเข้าร่วมการแข่งขัน Girls' Fight ประลองศิลปะการต่อสู้กัน การเล่นนั้นจะแบ่ง 2 ช่วงคือการฝึกและการสู้ ในการฝึกเราต้องคอยดูแลสาวๆไม่ให้เครียด วางแผนว่าจะปั้นเอาสเตตัสแบบไหนก่อน หรือ ฝึกเอาท่ามาก่อน หรือไม่ก็คุยกับสาวๆเพื่อให้ผูกพันธ์กันมากขึ้น ไม่ก็ออกไปหาข่าวรอบๆ รร. ว่าจะเจอคู่แข่งแบบไหน สา่วๆเรามีความลับอะไรปิดรึเปล่า จากนั้น พอเข้าสู่ช่วงสู้ จะเป็นลักษณะการ์ดเกมครับ คอยเลือกการ์ดมาประชันกัน ยิ่งค่าการ์ดเยอะ พลังท่าที่ใช้น้อย เราจะได้เปรียบแต่ท่าจะเบา แต่ถ้าพลังท่าเยอะเราจะเสียเปรียบแต่ท่าจะแรง และแต่ละท่ามีบัฟและดีบัฟสนับสนุนกันอีก สนุกดีครับ โดยรวมแล้ว เป็นภาคที่ผมชอบสุดในซีรีห์นี่เลยนะ เกมตอนนี่ลดอยู่ 15% ได้ละมั้ง คุ้มราคาดีครับ 9/10 is Final score ครับ :Dmy gameplay (TH)

												if you want to play this game...get dr. shinanogi. trained and used correctly, she is a numbing force of evil that can dismantle any team one-by-one, and you do /not/ want to be on the wrong end of those 'waste an entire turn' stuns. numb is the most useful status effect and she starts off with two abilities that can trigger it, giving you double the opportunity to ruin some poor ai's day by stunning them over. and over. and over again. while you use your insane agility to ruin their chances of winning the tournament.she is a one-woman team and i'm glad to be her assistant no. 2.

												This is great stuff! Please read the description and look at the screenshots, this is not a waifu fighter, it's a card battle game and training sim, and it's great at both of those things.The new characters are a lot of fun (oh my lord Chacha) and the balance between training and fights is well handled. Every girl comes with their own skills, and figuring out the best stat focus for them is really rewarding. Overall, great stuff! Would like if there was a gender option for the player character, but that's a minor gripe.Absolutely recommended if you like VN/light sim stuff.			",141,135,0,42,14,2,18

												There are a wide variety of waifus in this game. So many you can't even use them all on your first,second,third, or fourth playthrough. And you know what that means! There are 15 waifus you can choose from to be apart of your Fight Club team. What waifus do you have in this game?! Well you got stand power wheel chair waifu aka Best Girl, you got Lone Wolf Boxer waifu who you can consider your Ippo or Joe of the team, you got your loli greatest disciple chinese waifu, you got your Otaku Madoka Magical Girl waifu, you got your ninja waifu, you got your Robo-heroine protagonist waifu, you have a WIDE variety to choose from. Yes some ARE better than others. But is laifu when picking a waifu.			",15,4,0,4,3,0,4

												First time I didn’t had a clue what was going on.Second time understood how exactly the training influences the characters and that there’s no need to learn all the skills. Well, at least on of each (if possible) and 1 and 2 value.Third time: Cleaned the Whole House.Well, each time you play you end unlocking skills for your character (manager) which help.I first impulse of a team was the team that I ended up choosing all the time I played: Motoko, Rin and Liling.Liling has a counter move that’s really overpowered, especially if you powerup her Chi. One or two counters can knock out even the strongest opponent.Rin has a Henshin move, but it’s not very useful. Striking is better, and everything with Stun is gold.Motoko – learn all the stun moves and punish their legs, it’s awesome. I love Motoko! ",220,61,5,40,12,3,18

												This is a stat building simulator game, where fighting is simulated through card battle.  It took me awhile to figure out how the card battle works, and I can see why many people are frustrated due to lack of transparancy.  I would still recommend this game because I've ejoyed playing it and 773 / Seikai Project has made efforts to improve the game.Card battle tips here:  http://www.giantbomb.com/cherry-tree-high-girls-fight/3030-54287/Positives Good music Good anime styled art work Good visual novel styled dialogue Replay the game to learn different character's strengths/weakenesses, discovering 'scenarios' for each character (keywords), and Online RankingsNegatives Card battle is not transparant, the tutorial doesn't go into detail and you can't view opponent's stats Too many variables that is RNG based, which alters the outcome of the card battle No PvP, only single-player on Easy/Normal/Hard mode(unlocked upon 1st completion) ",8,8,0,6,2,0,9

												Great idea for a game. The art is wonderful, and the story is decent. However, the combat system is quite terrible, and very boring.			",98,15,1,17,6,1,10
