												Fun game and quite the challenge. Physics feel real good and I like how there are different maps. Pretty much the only VR game out there for soccer fans that I know of.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Definately worth the budget admission fee. I played the demo then bought the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great little game!  Its often the simple ideas that are the most addictive.  Rather like Space Pirate Trainer - simple yet so well executed is extremely addictive.  I cannot wait for the update (especially headers from corners).  Highly recommended, and can only get better.  Oh,, and its WAY harder than you imagine before you play it.  Easy to play, hard to master.			",29,7,3,2,8,1,0

												Being a football fan, I was immediately interested by Hat Trick Header. It’s a football based game where you use your head to header the ball at targets that appear in front of you. It’s simple and it’s totally brilliant!The basic premise is balls get fired at you and you have to use your head to aim said balls at targets that appear, move, turn and disappear in front of you. The more you hit, the better your score and you get bonus points for consecutive strikes. It’s a simple idea that has been executed superbly well.The graphics are great, they’re not realistic but you still feel as though you’re actually in the bright and colourful world around you. The environment, of which there are three, are really well thought out. There is the training ground, a beach and a football stadium which are all set in Brazil.The game feels spot on with the accuracy of the headers. As long as you remember that you’re trying to make contact with your forehead, you’ll soon get the hang of aiming the ball. It’s easy to pick up, but very hard to master which makes getting those hit streaks even more satisfying! Whilst playing I found myself really getting into it, from throwing my body at the ball to generate more power to pulling back to cushion the ball to hit the lower targets. I felt so immersed in the game that more than a few times I attempted to kick a stray ball that was rolling in front of me or even trying to chest a ball down, I’m glad nobody was watching me…The polish and attention to detail in Hat Trick Header is very impressive. The little details the developers have added are excellent such as the little spinning balls in the Vive controllers … you barely use the controllers, they didn’t need to put so much effort into animating those! The same with the audio, I love the way that you can hear the dull thud as the ball bounces back off the post or crossbar. The goal is just part of the environment, nobody would have even noticed if that sound wasn’t there, but it is, and it’s really appreciated! The same for the fireworks when you beat your high score, it’s these little touches and extra effort that makes this game a joy to play.Local multiplayer is a really nice touch, you can have 4 people playing, taking turns swapping the headset which I will be testing out next time I have some mates over, of if I can convince the wife to give it a go!You can also customise your player and team although I’m not convinced how much that adds to the game, but it’s a nice option to have.There are three difficulty levels and two different modes for each environment, which is the position of the targets. These along with the 3 different locations adds quite a bit a replayability. I don’t see this as a game you’ll spend more than an hour at a time on, but it’s definitely one I will keep coming back to as it’s addictive to try beat your previous high scores. That, and it’s bloody great fun!It’s great to see a quality, polished VR release that isn’t in early access but I do hope the developers add a few bits to it in the future. Whilst playing I wished I could aim for the goal rather than the targets. Trying to score past a keeper from crosses would be a really great addition. Or maybe just some other targets such as buckets or basketball hoops to add a bit of variety. I’d even be happy to pay for these additions as DLC as the base price of the game offers great value!The header mechanics in Hat Trick Header works really well and it’s great to see something so different hit the VR store. There isn’t enough depth to keep you playing for hours at a time, but what is there is brilliant and a joy to play. This will be one of those titles that I keep coming back to as it’s fun, satisfying and puts a smile on my face every time I manage to hit a target!It’s the best sports game on the VR store and if you’re a fan of football I can’t recommend it highly enough!Disclaimer bit: I was kindly given a key to review this game for my Vive Blog[viveblog.com], but it hasn't effected my review, if it was a turd I would say so...

												First of all thanks again to the developers for the free Key - it´s the first time for me to get a steam-giveaway and i really appreciate it. Now about the game:Interface: I really like the short intro - instantly made me feel like i´m standing on a soccer pitch. The Menus are very clean, nice and intuitive...there are not many options i have to fumble around with - which i really appreciate. The haptic feedback in the controller when i highlight the options is something i really like. So on to the first round :)Look: The graphics are very good...a nice mixture of a simple and clean look like in Rec Room and of really good and also very detailed textures like in The Lab. Definately looks ""professional & polished"" and not ""homebrewn"" like so many other games sold on Steam.Gameplay: Startet the Training Grounds - took a look around...beautiful view and immersive feel there. You dont really need much tutorial tips...you really know what to do and how to do it as soon as the first few balls start flying towards your head :) - GREAT ! The use of steam achievements and the commentator really gives me good motivation.Feel: Feels very realistic, you really can intuitively control the aim and speed of your headers perfectly. One time a ball i already had shot slowly rolled back from the target towards me while i was waiting for the next ones to shoot and i caught myself trying to kick it away with my foot because i was afraid i´d fall over it :) - That´s how VR should make you feel !Performance: Everything runs great on my System (I7 with a GTX970) and i had no issues at all while playing.Final Suggestions: -i know it´s not possible because the headset doesn´t have a rumble unit included but it would be really nice if there was a haptic feedback when hitting the ball -i also would be nice to include more then just hitting targets in future updates. I am thinking of games like ""Flick Kick Football Legends"" or ""NewStarSoccer"" gameplay-wise where you get into situations where you can try to beat the goalkeeper or pass towards teammates - stuff like that to add more long-term-motivation to a really not cheap game......final conclusion: everyone who is into funny and semi-realistic sports-games should definately try this gem - especially if it gehts on a special offer/sale sometime soon !...PS: Sorry for my bad english - not my native language !

												Picked this up as I've wanted to see what a football game would be like in VR, the only one I've tried before was an old demo on my DK1 with Kinect hooked up to my PC where you got to take penaltys and it was decent for what it was but pretty simple and basic.  While in this game it's only headers and not full football it's still great fun.  For the most part the ball reacts to your headers as you'd expect, you can put some force into it or just do a gentle nod for targets that are low down.   I've even tried jumping up for a few headers and it worked, although I can see that ending badly for my ceiling.  Plenty of different levels too and seems like plenty to keep you going for a while.  I'd have loved to have the option to be trying to win headers in an actual game and trying to beat a keeper but that's a minor niggle.  You'll also probably do what I do everytime the ball bounces back and automatically try and kick it...additional sensors for your feet can't come soon enough.			",563,155,29,48,99,13,83
