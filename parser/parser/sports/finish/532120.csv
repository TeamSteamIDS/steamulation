								As a player; being Axel Rix is really exciting. Each level has unique suprises like variety of targets and balls.Heading dynamics are so real and graphics quality is one of the best I've ever experienced. This game makes me addicted in very short time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I played this game on my HTC Vive. The physics, graphics and audio seems very realistic and honestly it made me sweat after playing 4 levels. This game is a must have for Vive owners. I think it is 100% worth it. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								First it is hard to get how to make the enough points to pass each level, but after getting used to it Header Goal VR takes you into game and makes you feel like a football player. Graphically, Header Goal is so far one of the bests and I am sure you will enjoy the experince of being axel rix as much as I did. If you have htc vive, you need to purchase this one for sure. I'm looking forward to seeing full version of this game.			",2,0,0,0,0,0,0
