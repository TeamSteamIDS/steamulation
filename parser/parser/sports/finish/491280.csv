												---PROS---The game it self is fun and the customisation is big with lots of content.The online component is made very well and I experienced very little lag on it---CONS---There are some bugs like constant music changing automatically while driving.And falling off maps.Game feels choppy on an up to date pc.Devs have stated that the game will be updated.Game isn't in early access which most likely means the game will rarely be updated.If the Devs do update this game and fix the issues I'll update my review and maybe recommend the game.EDIT: Google Play ( Android ) has this game on it.

												- No body customization. The cars look like that from the start.- Upgrades are only decent at best. The game gives you the ability to change the exhaust, pistons and add turbos. That's pretty much it for engines. Not kidding, only those three.- Not much in the way of settings. For graphics, you can only choose between Low, Med and High. There's also no option for Audio and further controls customization.Important:- You are literally penalized for just playing the game. The game has a system where you have to pay for engine wear, tyre wear, and fuel. They all go down when you drive the car at all. No, not  when you crash; when you DRIVE. You have to pay for these individually. My minimal pay for drifting is even more subtracted now. The heck am I supposed to buy anything at all?Maybe this is normal in other games? I only fancy games where I am not limited in something like this. Honestly, the first person who thought penalizing your players for playing your game the way it's supposed to was a good idea should have their loved ones beaten. (Because they are probably equally as douchey.) If the developers wanted realism, work on the physics first.- Wheel users can go jump off a cliff. The game countersteers the car for you when drifting in a game ABOUT drifting. There is no option to turn this off. There is also no FFB, at all. So yay.I'm a wheel user. If I wanted the game to take control of my steering and assuming I'm a GTR fanboy who doesn't actually know how to drift, Christ, I can go to NFS 2015 for that.If you have a good computer and are looking for a game with nice drifting physics and lots of upgrades and tuning, get Forza you madman. At least on that game the developers doesn't hate you and give the chance to earn money.If you're looking for realism get Assetto Corsa. (But you're reading this so you're probably aren't.)Positives? I can't really think of any that isn't already done better by another game. Drifting is okay? Graphics look very nice? Again, if you want pretty pictures get Forza.			",13,1,5,1,9,0,0

I hoped this new game are least same thing DSJ has to offer. I was wrong! DH is not fun to drive/drift.

												The only hope/wish I have for this game Developer please don't abadon it. If you need money make DLC.. Thanks!!! --- Edited, Updated review 3/27/2017 ---People cry about this game, cuz you can't make enough money, i drifted a little and over 200k... It is a little more slidy than usual car racing games, but it's arcade.. what do you want? Go buy Project cars if you want Sim.. Another thing crying about 7 dollars? Really you guys never gave money for homeless or poor people? You won't die cuz of that, maybe the DEV is greedy, who isn't nowadays? I care about my money, but not about 7 dollars, either quit crying or just get a job. Don't take it offensive, but truth hurts. E.G If you go out and drink that's wasted money too... or just steam acc lvling... (read the reviews...)If you liked Drift Streets Japan you will love this game. Arcadish drift! Hell yeah!+Modifications (hopefully we get more)+Cars+Soundtracks+Turbo tracks+Fuel comp and tire wear.+Online sessions+Physics+Bets (1v1 race)-No option for changing online maps-No Akina map (yet)-Car jumps a little over lamps etc. Sometimes annoying.-Not enough rims :( (at least not for me)-Engine swaps-No controller support.-Anti sping out! THE GAME IS TOO EASY NOW.I bought the game to support the developer, hopefully he is not going to mess up nor abadon this game. I pretty much like it. $7-$10 is not too much either. Right now I would give a weak 8/10. If you liked DSJ Must buy! :D Short review, sorry I have to go to drift! :)			",187,19,19,16,18,1,7

												I played the ""Drift Streets Japan"" from the same devs, and here are some PROS/CONS.+Pros   Big selection of cars, and some specials.   Big selection of tuning parts.   Nice Tracks and the online mode is working better.-Cons   The game feels choppy.   Some menues are just useless, for example the ""ECU"" Tuning.   You cant turn off music.   The Music just comes and goes at some points of the map.   No real body-customization.   The Regedit Unlimited Money and YEN Cheat still works.   The Auction menu also is just useless and just takes up place.   The game would be a lot better with some FPS Optimization.   The ""better graphics"" look like everything is made out of plastic.Honestly, I dont think the game is worth 10â‚¬.I bought it on sale for 7.50â‚¬ and I still feel ripped off.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, it has potential to be honest but the game isn't finished yet, therefore I don't think this is worth 10 bucks. Anyway the game is simple and cool for those who like cars + drifting, you can't modify cars, just tune them up a little bit and give it a paint color. It kind of has some good graphics but not in the same time. Anyway, I'm not good in reviewing games but I think y'all should try it out if you really are into just drifting.(I got this game on a giveaway, just search it up cause I can't post the link here.)

												Starting off, I'd like to address all the unconstructive negative reviewers out there that simply can't not complain about bugs in a review of a new game, and also do not tune their cars properly and complain when the physics is bad.Anyone without a constructive negative review of this game days after its release has clearly not had enough time on it. You all need to think hard, and try harder.Until I have more time to feel out the game and learn how to control my car before writing an actual review like all you simple one track minded negative folk aren't doing I'm sure.I'm advising you to GET GOOD, until I saw the ECU tuning, Gear lengths(I think), and a few other options I was completely against the idea of this game.As I said, I'm waiting to fully review DHO when more maps come into mutliplayer, but for now coming from DSJ I do recommend this as IT IS BEING UPDATED FREQUENTLY and Drift Streets Japan is NOT, heres what I can tell you so far about settings.Tuning is pretty dead close to DSJ but has a bit more options to adjust your angles, as well as your power, I'm a keyboard player by the way, so I'm not gonna cry about your controllers and wheels not working for whatever reason in my future reviewCan't say I enjoy every car in the game but seeing the trailer has cars in it that aren't in this version, well one would assume there will be more maps and cars.

												EN:It is so funny to look at people opinions where they crying that they spend that $7 or $10 on a game! JESUS CHRIST WORLD IS GONNA END!! I bought it just today, and yes there are MANY CON about this game, but let's face it and take it seriously. Devs propobly made this game on really tight budget, it is not AAA game, but Indie game! I spend 7 Pounds (about $10) today and I AM VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT GAME! Maybe it's not the best spent money every, but I am supporting DEVs and I hope they will improve that game a lot. Let's talk about the PROPS!- Graphics looks very nice, but I thing some stuff is too shiny (at least 4 me)- LOTS OF CAR TO CHOOSE!- Physics is better than DSJ, but still needs improvements. Now it's easy to slide, but with max turbo it's just impossible. CONS- Game have many glitches (the city map most of them)- Cars not got any body mods, annoying because you have to buy new car to get body kit.- Not enough wheels and also mechanical tuning sucks a bit. I also cannot see the power out put like in DSJ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥it!- Why is there no First Person Mode?Finally? Game is good, just it's not ready to give it as a FINAL product, but more like Early Access. It's like cutted DSJ with nicer graphics, and that sucks a lot!DSJ Was a great concept for a game... Why did you messed it up?Over all I give it very weak 7/10. Hope it will be improved, and people that say ""PHYSICS ISN""T Realistic"" If u want realism than buy Project Cars or Assetto Corsa not a Cheap Arcade game!Oh and give support for controllers			",8,1,4,0,1,0,1

												really diggin the physics of the game, however, the accumulation of money to purchase additional cars is a little silly. it feels like ill be playing for a long long time before i can earn enough for a new car. it could have been on my end, but it seems like the controller support needs work. my car was just roasting tires and not going anywhere without me touching the controller itself. the gearbox controlls are a little odd. it would be nicer if there was a shift up or down button vs using the numbers to select a gear. with maybe a hotspot button for a specific gear. many of my friends and myself are into lowered cars and drifting so the game itself is a very cool concept. the maps are a little small, but in all its still an enjoyable game. i would work on the money thing for sure though. its a little discouraging to keep me wanting to play more as it feels like im never going to get a reward for my efforts.

												It's a bit rough and ready but it's super fun. You can get really nerdy with changing loads of suspention settings. I managed to totally ruin my car by putting a massive turbo on it and then ruining the suspention settings. Which was both informative and funny. Hopefully I can learn to fix it. You can even remap your ECU that i'm scared to do but it seems like it will be fun to seee if the engine will actually explode. The game is so detailed that it probably will! It's also really relaxing when you get the hang of it and glide effortlessly round a corner or two. It's a great drifting game.			",164,23,7,39,20,1,22

												Played this game for a bit. Its really good! But the biggest thing is my controller freaked out just like it did in Drift Street Japan... And I fell through the map a couple times. But the game just came out so I cant talk to bad about it. If they keep it updated I say this will be a popular game. For the price might as well try it out! BUT if controller doesnt get fixed then the game will suck.Im planning on playing around with controller settings to see if that will fix it.**I also did what they said when setting up controller. Didnt work still sits and revs and hot brakes itself.**Link to video below! I managed to hit every pole in the game!

												Do I recommend the game is a yes and no. The Pros: It is pretty fun game for the money and if you enjoy cars and drifting It's an okay game OVERALL, however its bad in the sense of how the physics feel, the sway of the cars, the drifting motion, the drifting backwards and zooming off into trees (Check con section). There is a little bit of content to keep yourself entertained.The Cons: There is a variety of cons for this game. Using a controller is super confusing and almost impossible, Might have to reconfigure yourself. Using a keyboard is just annoying because its either full throttle or nothing. The music is a headache and starts then changes and starts and stops. The sound is meh, it's just not what i was expecting. The feeling of the cars was confusing to much, as such it felt like i was on ice and it was lock diff no matter what with no traction. Sometimes when i over cook a drift it goes into what i call mega speed and i go really fast backwards. It was too easy to make money, I used the ae86 on the first drift track held it together for a long time and recieved i think it was over 150k. Easy to manipulate. If the game goes through some updates I will check them out as it is pretty fun to play and will update my review. If you're a dedicated 'car guy' i would say buy it. If you're just after a car game to drive around I would not recommend.			",99,11,6,4,13,1,5

												I'll be honest here. No it isn't the most realistic drift simulation game I've everplayed. That's also due to the way the car reacts to sufaces for example, when you just wanna accelerate alittle, the wheels start to spin without any grip/traction at all even though you did not step on the gas. It is glitchy and choppy especially if you get only 30fps (but i usually get 60+). For the graphics, I wont expect much but its good enough considering the budget of the game. Though I think that the road must not look like  ICE   ( I hope that would be fixed soon ) .But I enjoyed it alot to be honest . Money isn't hard to get (if its hard then mabey you're sorta bad at this game :v). One thing that bothers me alot is the fact that i can upgrade my piston heads in a rotary engine (RX 7 FD) ... Seriously ? That's a downer for me.  I really hope that this would be fixed in future updates.I'm really happy that the devs really are working hard to fix the problems with this game. Kudos to you guys ~ :D			",99,15,4,2,3,0,2

												I only played it for a few minuites and could already tell it would be a buggy / zero fun game. The graphics dont look as good as the picture, although i wouldnt say they are bad. Also the game is very arcady which might be okay for some but not everyone.Also the start screen is long and boring.I like the main menu but the rest of them such as the customisation menu is weird and is centered across the screen which looks odd.I like the music and the volume control that goes with it, seems to increase and decrease with car volume.If the game gets updated some and further polished, it could become a decent game for some. Just not really feeling it right now.Nice idea though :)			",9,2,4,1,4,0,0

												I can't really talk bad about this game as it is a new game. It features more in depth customization than DSJ (Engine wise that is). The body kits you see in the video are already on the cars and can't be removed BUT BEFORE YOU GET MAD, there is for 90% of the cars stock versions with no body kit. Overall I give this game a 9.5/10. to get that extra 0.5 just needs minor improvements like bug fixes. Those bugs aren't game breaking bugs either, most of the bugs people complained about have been fixed. I highly reccomend this game. Thanks for reading and THANK YOU JDM4iK for bringing us such an amazing game!			",32,1,7,0,6,0,0

Product received for free
Pros:Really good physics and handling in my opinion.Cars are really good, especially the supra.Good musicCons:Tends to microstutter sometimes.Controller support is horrible, or I'm just stupid to set it up properly. I tried to set up my xbox controller many times, but I failed. I can't shift with it no matter what I do. Triggers also doesn't work.Not many tracksCar names are reversed on the back of the car (wtf???)I don't know why people complain about earning money in the game. I pretty much bought all cars in 2 hours... You just need to drift in circles for a while and you get a lot of money. You get 100 dollars for 6 sec continous drift and 500 for 10 sec + you also get money for the points. The port are perfect for doing this. I even almost maxed out every car, though I went a little bit far with a x400+ combo and earned around 40mil points... XDI seriously want to like this game, but right now I have mixed feelings about it, but I'm gonna give it a positive, because I hope that it's gonna be better. It has a lot of potential, but it needs a lot of work. Please do take into consideration that I got this game for free, so for me it was worth it, though I don't know if I would have the same opinion if I'd bought in on my own money!!!
