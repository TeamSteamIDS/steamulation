												A ""pure"" game, like tetris. Waveform is easy to understand, but difficult to master. While playing, I'm continuously surprised at how well the core mechanic of modifying the frequency and amplitude of a sine wave to collect points actually works. Awesome job, I love to see nicely done new mechanics like this.			",141,51,1,10,17,4,13

Aim for the sweet spots, avoid obsticles, and try not to be distracted. Simple yet super challenging. A cool game for all ages that I'd even break out at a party.

												Waveform tasks you with controlling a wave of light through a galaxy of planets. The goal is reaching the Sun from Pluto, a journey which traverses over 100 levels through 11 different worlds. As further levels are reached, the goal of reaching the Sun expands into stopping a singularity that threatens to darken the entire galaxy. More elements of the story are revealed in later levels.The concept of controlling a wave of light is executed flawlessly through beautifully rendered levels and a challenging, but addictive gameplay experience. If you are looking for a truly unique and innovative experience you shouldn’t hesitate to add Waveform to your game library.Overall verdict: Highly recommended!			",1949,689,76,189,204,14,282

												I'm extremely surprised to see that Waveform isn't more popular. It has to be one of the most original Action-Puzzler released those past few years. This is truthfully one of the craziest indie game I've played in a long time, with a gameplay that is so simple but yet so addictive! To put it short, you control a sinusoidal wave with your mouse, modifying its lenght and height as it suits you to catch all the coloured circles scattered around. The content is massive, more than a 100 levels for the campaign, and as much in the challenge mode.  Waveform will suit any kind of gamer, casual or hardcore. A bottle of aspirin is highly required if you aim to 100% complete every single level available !There's even a survival mode with leaderboards, just in case you want to prove you're a better wave rider than the rest of the world.Also, thumbs up for the best ending level in the history of Wavelenght gaming. I strongly recommend this game! Totally worth its full price. I noticed you could now get it for 0,19€ only during sales. That's almost a steal! Do yourself a favour and add this game to your library now !			",158,66,12,7,19,4,27

												A simple puzzle game where you manipulate your trajectory by moving the mouse in all directions, to control the wave form you travel across.Along the track you have to pick up bonuses and avoid mines, and at times have to perfectly follow a given path.You are constantly adjusting the path in order to keep things going, and things quickly become more and more difficult.Overall a well made and challenging puzzle game.

												Waveform is very relaxing, but still a real challenge. Fresh mechanics throughout the levels keeps the gameplay varied. Each level looks great, and rewards you for performing well. Finishing levels isn't so much of a challenge, but doing well enough to unlock a star level, or hit a black hole, provides enough incentive to play levels again. Overall a very great, peaceful yet challenging game. Definitely worth the price.			",188,36,8,25,30,0,25

												Waveform seems simple enough, but this game is tough. You control the amplitude and wavelength of an orb to run through a gauntlet of space objects. The control aspect is quite intuitive with a mouse, but getting the waveform to follow just the right path is more than tricky--it's downright difficult.What I didn't realize after completing Pluto is that there are many other planets to be completed. The interface didn't exactly make it obvious (to me at least) that you can scroll through these other planets. With the amount of content this game has to offer, it really is an excellent value for puzzle gamers--just be prepared for frustration.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												Very fun, addictive and easy to get into. It's not TOO EASY either, in fact....I find it rather hard at times. It has made me rage several times, and yet I still come back.The controls are very simple and the screen itself doesn't fill up with too much information for you at once.The concept involving waves of light is done very precise and the sensitivity of the mouse can be edited to whatever degree you want to have it at.The 'story' takes you through the solar system and the background settings and effects are in great detail! It's a pretty game overall, I found myself staring at the background as I died a few times. haha..The music is very nice in this game as well! Nice balance of bass and tunes~(That's saying a lot as I tend to listen to my own music while games are muted)The music is each stage is different and the rate that they play in depends on how you play the level.Replay value, at least for me is very high.

												This is a pretty damn fun puzzle game with a very simple concept that scales appropriately in difficulty over time. Admittedly some of the features introduced can be quite obnoxious (particularly wormholes) but it's a genuinely enjoyable challenge of skill and timing.Then you get to the last set of planets and are immediately gated by obnoxious requirements. You see, at each level you are scored a percentage, which awards you a number of stars rounded down to the lowest ten e.g. 79% = 7 stars! Can you see where this is going? Waveform ultimately turns into an obnoxiously grind-fest wherein you're playing the same level over and over to scrap an extra few points out to potentially have enough stars to unlock another level or two. This star requirement is present throughout the game but it really ramps up towards the end.Honestly it's quite a fun game, but I can't imagine actually finishing it. Probably the perfect tablet game for killing time as you gather those last few stars at a glacial pace over the course of a few weeks. Not worth buying on Steam unfortunately.			",253,86,2,60,7,2,34

 About WaveformWaveform is a perfect example of a unique idea done right. The gameplay is executed flawlessly, the style is unique, and there is certainly plenty of meat to the game. The only real downfall is that it seems to be undedicated to a single audience; it seems to be and plays somewhat like a puzzle game yet is at times extremely fast-paced and incredibly difficult, two things which are generally not seen together. For what it does, Waveform is an amazing game, and one that many hours could be poured into. Release Date: 20 Mar, 2012	 The GameplayThe first hurdle newcomers to the game will encounter is the gameplay mechanics. Not because they're flawed and unplayable, but because they're different than anything else you've likely played before, meaning it can take an hour or two of trial and error to truly understand how to use it. It's honestly easier to see in Waveform's trailer than it is to explain, but to sum it up: You control a wavy line of light, and the only thing you can't do with it is slow it down. Your goal is to collect orbs and waves while avoiding various obstacles and using the environment to your advantage to change your path or the objects around you.The GamemodeThe second thing that will likely be offputting is the game's difficulty. Expect to have to repeat levels and sections of levels multiple times in order to simply pass the level, especially if it's a level that requires (near-)perfection in a certain section in order to succeed. When you finally do succeed, don't be surprised to receive a rating of 30%, either, as the game is quite stingy with its ratings, requiring practically flawless runs of an entire level to get the full 10-star 100% rating. Luckily, the game does have checkpoints and levels generally aren't terribly long, plus you don't need anywhere near the max number of stars to access the levels you need them to unlock. Still, you're likely to end up frustrated at times with Waveform, especially if you're the completionist type.The Sound Other than those potential issues and some others like repetitive audio, Waveform is a great game. It's very chill for the most part, unless you're going for 100% in every level or run into a difficult level or section. There are little bits of story after some levels that, while not exactly Mass Effect-level engrossing, are intriguing. Despite the difficulty, there will be few places where it feels like the mistakes you make are the fault of the game. You won't be able to find a game elsewhere like it, and it does what it does well, thus Waveform gets a strong recommend from me.All in All  Waveform is a good Indie Game8/10 From Me Sweep ",122,14,2,7,7,0,7

												There's a fix for the crash:Try changing ""UseShaders"" to ""False"" in the config.ini file.You can find that file in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Waveform\configOriginal review:---Common crashes on Uranus' first level. Can't progress - do not buy until they fix this mess.Great game otherwise, requiring constant attention (although can be tiring) and good reflexes. Control is easy, but dragging your mouse to lengthen, shorten, widen the wave to avoid obstacles. Graphic is good, doesn't hurt my fragile eyes by not providing junk looking pixels.DLC is overpriced one, though. One measly level for a dollar. And it's just a single level not multi-layered level.			",1566,614,62,185,176,20,269

												+Very unusual gameplay+Soundtrack, very chilling and nice+The pricepoint is really DIVINE, other game publishers should learn from this example !+Graphics is also great and it works visually to complete the experience and its radical idea.You cant move, because you are a wave. But instead you can shapeshift indefinitely being a sinewave, you also have to... And you conquer the obsticles and hit powerups, wormholes and items.The controls are a bit unpredictable by every measurement.Instead you start to see the result, and you begin to match with the result every time.In most games, you have some feedback of some sort about your location.It took some plays to get used to being a wave.But when that was done, you will control its form and navigate through the solar system to travel in time with a lot of visualization.-I hate being a wave.11/10			",1524,532,80,166,192,22,246

												Waveform is an odd one.You don't move your ship-dot-thing. You move its path.And its path, as the name implies, is a waveform.Vertical mouse dragging causes the trough and valley of the wave to change, horozontally dragging changes the steepness of the line.This is very hard to control, but in this case, that's a good thing. The controls work. They're not jerky, they're not too fast or too slow, every mistake is your own. But unlike in some other games, I feel an incentive to learn and adjust to the system.It also looks pretty large as well. The first planet has 8 levels, so I'd assume that's standard and there are 9 planets. So you get 72 levels with the game, and if you feel like getting the DLC (which I did, simply because it was also on sale and $0.14 at the time I bought it), you get about 8 more.Even when you're done with the levels there's still a high score board to work at. Upon clearing a planet you unlock an unlimited mode for it. I'm not sure what the difference between Pluto unlimited and Mercury unlimited is, but if I were to guess I'd say each planet has slightly different mechanics.All in all I think this could be one of those weird little gems with a bit more work put into it. For less than a dollar though, I definitely recommend it. For that price you'd get 4 runs at it in an arcade, but here you're getting full access.			",135,31,1,10,14,3,9

												Waveform is an imaginary line representing all parts of a wave where particles are vibrating in the same phase and have the same distance from the source. Waveform is related to speed, wavelength and frequency . - Wave speed (v) = Distance traveled by a wave per unit of time.- Wavelength (λ) = The distance between two consecutive points which are in phase.- Frequency (ƒ) = The number of complete oscillations made in one second.Where:-Speed = Frequency (ƒ) x Wavelength (λ)v= ƒλThe higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength. At constant speed, when the frequency increase, the wavelength will decrease.In this game, you have to modify the wavelength and amplitude and guide the particle to collect light orbs in order to score points. Thus, you're playing a Displacement-Distance (s-d) graph game. Where amplitude (a) and wavelength (λ) will be playing as the main role of the game.The bigger the amplitude, the shorter the wavelength, the faster the particle will travel throughout the wave.Vice versa, the larger the wavelength, the smaller the amplitude, the slower the particle will travel throughout the wave.Basically this concept is easy to understand with this Waveform Simulator, however to modify the wavelength while the particle is traveling at super speed will be tough and challenging for some players to master this game.I love Physics, that's why I bought this game.

												If you're a serios gamer or a competitive one, you can't miss this experience.It's a very simple game that is very (!!) hard to master.Get past the first hour, and you're hooked.It's all about moving your mouse (no buttons!) to perfect the waveform in order to collect stuff.More and more aspects build the game from level to level, keeping it interesting and totally immersive.The game is loooooooong. About 100 levels.Even after you finish (I haven't yet) all the levels (or before), you can enter a ""deep space"" mode - a random mode of the game and compete for the leaderboards, a feature missed in so many other good games.So, let's recap how your life will be organized if you dare install:1. Get better and better on your mouse instincts.2. Progress through the levels (you can also try to get 100% levels if you're hardcore).3. Find out there are a lot of levels and even more instincts involved.4. Continue up the levels (collecting ""stars"").5. Realize you're addicted and get help.6. Return from getting help and play indefinitely. FTW.Wondeful level and game design with hunderds of play hours awaiting me.Great music to follow you while you stare amazed at the soothing graphics.Haven't been this happy since I first found trackmania or played WC3!A true jem, probably because it's a game that is just built RIGHT. Design, implementation, the lots.Play. Enjoy. Compete. Repeat.Booga.P.S. I may just pay for the little DLC (which I don't really feel I need) just to give them another dollar.The price is rediculusly low. I almost thought it was crap just because of it..

												There's just one inherent problem with this game's design.Did you divert from the set path the level developers set out for you? Prepare to miss a ton of stuff and/or die nine out of ten times.There's literally no room for experimentation and when what you're supposed to do isn't immediately clear (which is often) you're generally punished for trying to figure things out. Combine that with how frustratingly precise the waves you need to make are a lot of the time and the end result is just a tedious mess of a game. Apparently I've only played through four worlds and there are something like 7 or 8 left (plus the DLC that I unfortunately purchased). I don't see myself returning to this game though, it's not enjoyable to me.			",279,227,3,13,13,4,26

Even I find it hard to be frustrated on the difficult levels, due to the relaxing music. In some sense, it appears as though the objects you must align to contribute to the rhythm of the music as well. As a rhythm gamer myself (for osu!), I would recommend trying out game.

												Modify a wave to catch orbs and avoid obstaclesPros:  + Great music and sound  + Nice graphics  + Original conceptCons:  - Controls are counter-intuitive  - No freedom, you either follow the path as intended by the level designer, or you're screwed  - Cannot recover from a single mistake  - Obnoxious 'info' screens in between games.

												Waveform is an ego-shooting RTS city building war simulation strategy platformer with highly advanced 3D text-based graphics that actively requires you to think and work with what you believe in. The levels are challenging, the game concept is complex, the graphics are stunning and the music is making you feel warm and fuzzy.However, what if the game that is presented us here is not actually the way it seems? What if the light transmission that you resemble is actually a communistic propaganda transmission that is meant to destroy the already desolated parts of space that you have to visit in the game?What if the developer of the game is actually not a brave American that loves this country and is secretly reporting to foreign forces like China and Russia instead?I am just asking questions.The levels you visit are designed in colorful schemes and the text-input that you have to play the game with is presented to you in a deliberately socialistic manner. How can we know that this game is not actually a Russian spy program that tries to make your brain feel positive about terrible horrors like communism?As well as most people here, I also wrote several scientific essays about this game, but in contrast to what the mainstream media presents to you, I do not fully agree in the concept that this game is just a nice indie game, instead I have the theory that this nice indie game is actually a secret communistic agenda developed by satanists that try to overthrow the free government in the US as well as everywhere else, like Canada or New Hampshire.This game is a riddle. This game is a mystery and as long as the developer does not stand up and actively defends our constitution, I cannot trust him that this game is not a mean propaganda piece and as such, I cannot fully support it.God bless America.

												Waveform is a very entertaining game. The music is very well done and enjoyable, and the graphics, although simple, are very beautiful. The game doesn't provide much story, but it's one of those games that doesn't need to. It's addicting and it actually makes you want to get 100% on the levels, unlike many games with a similar mechanic. Overall, I would give Waveform a nine out of ten.			",94,20,0,5,11,0,12

												Waveform is a skill-based game where you control a photon's wave frequency and amplitude with the mouse to collect colored orbs, get a high score, and reach the level's end. Players go through levels around Pluto, all the way up to the Sun, seeing new mechanics along the way.Admittedly, I bought this game not expecting much, but I was met with an excellent experience that really tested my reflexes and ability to plan ahead.One can progress the base story simply by making it to the end of the level, but the full challenge of this game comes from getting the highest score possible in every level. Players have to really know how changing a wave's properties will affect the photon riding it.There are various mechanics in addition to moving the wave, like obstacles, gases that change wave speed, color combos and colored obstacles, and more. These quickly make the game very dynamic and fresh through every level.The game comes with a base story mode which is fairly linear, but also has secret levels, endless modes, and a challenge mode once you beat the story.I got this game for cheap in a bundle, and I'd say it was money well spent. If you're looking for a reflex-based, arcade-style game, Waveform is worth a look.			",18,3,0,1,5,0,2

												Easily the best game I've ever purchased for this price. It took a couple of levels before I could wrap my head around what exactly was going on, but once it clicked, it was very easy to control and play while still being very challenging. For a $2 game on sale for $.50 that I bought on a whim, just... wow. Worth the original two bucks easily. A well done, creative effort that sets itself apart from the shovelware glutting the indie market here these days. Figures, this was made 4 years ago before things got as bad as they are now.

												Waveform may be simple in concept, but flawless execution, decent music and the developer's  imagination makes it a memorable game. Be warned though, it gets tough. And I mean really tough.And as a kind of footnote, the dev deserves kudos for his unstinting efforts to improve the game after feedback left on the Steam forums. When I had a technical issue, he asked me to Skype him so he could go through several solutions with me! You don't get that with Rockstar or Electronic Arts. :)			",1559,639,96,144,109,17,200

												The concept of this game seems simple. You're controlling the path of a little orb by manipulating a wave. Collect orbs and score high.This game is however, anything but simple. Every few levels, you're dealing with new mechanics, whether it be a threat, or a new way to move, on top of the already existing mechanics. Once you get past a few sets of levels, it becomes harder and harder to focus on adjusting your wave when you're dodging well...many things.The soundtrack is well done and sortof puts you into a trance. It's really enjoyable and I'd listen to it for ages. The game itself offers a lot of interesting gameplay for it's low, low price. So I say this is definitely one of your must-haves.

												5 / 5What an absolute joy of a game. And this really is as pure of a game as I've played in a long time. You have a small ball of light trying to traverse the cosmos (various maps set against a back drop of space) by way of a sine wave. You control its travel by altering the sine wave...move the mouse up / down and the amplitude (height) grows / diminshes...move the mouse left / right and the frequency increases / decreases (how steep it goes up / down). Hit power ups, multipliers, and various other typical point scoring devices to get a high score and progress from map to map. Dodge black matter and various other space based hazards otherwise you lose points / fail the map.The basic gameplay structure (points based map completion) is old hat, but the mechanic of controlling  something via manipulation of a sine wave is unique and utterly appropriate for the simple premise of the game. Combined with a an excellent soundtrack (which somehow manages to combine a light hearted sound with something suitable to wandering through the depths of space) you'll find yourself smiling as you play this wonderful game.

The game ahs allot of levels one for each planet in our solar system and DLC for those super keen but overall it falls a bit flat with repitiion. Not bad for short sessions or time killers.

												Simple and fun game. Player guides sphere that is in constant waving motion. You can only control amplitude (how far up and down wave goes) and frequency (how many times wave goes up and down in certain amount of time) by moving your mouse. Goal is to collect items from level and avoid hitting obstacles. Controls are super simple but It still may take a short while to get hang of it. But after you do, this is really nice and relaxing game to play.After playing some levels I was worried game is actually too simple and repeating itself. But when getting to new planets, lots of new items, obstacles and helpers still keeps game interesting.Small annoyance is that sometimes just one hit can cause level to fail and you need to start from beginning or from last checkpoint which may be pretty far away. And it is really hard to say whenever hitting some obstacle causes this. Also planet/level selecting could be a bit faster, for example when trying to find levels where you could still improve your result.But those are very minor problems. Generally it seems to be easy to lost an hour staring this wave on the screen. Graphics works and this is one of the rare games where I haven't turned music off.There's lots of levels to play and you can advance to next level after passing previous one, no matter how poorly you did it. However getting perfect score from any level isn't easy, so there's definitely lots of challenge. Game is at least worth of its cheap price. ",62,9,2,0,1,0,4

												Oscilloscopes made fun.You control the amplitude and the frequency of a sine wave in order to collect all pick-ups on the level while avoiding obstacles. That's it. Despite the simplicity of the premise, the game plays surprisingly well, and has way more effort put into levels, art, music, and even writing, than one might expect from something with such a minimalist concept. Achieving 100% on all levels must be incredibly frustrating, though.P.S.On Linux, the game froze a few times on my computer (mostly when alt-tabbing and opening Steam overlay). Running it in a borderless window rather than full-screen seemed to alleviate that problem. If you take a look at the forums, some people have reported similar issues with Windows, too, as well as gave some solutions on how to mitigate them. Nonetheless, the technical issues weren't distracting enough to ruin my experience with the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												All your knowledge about cosinus and sinus waves are put to the test in this wave-riding game. It's along the lines of any puzzle game out there, but puts a twist by limiting your movement by the wave you create. Collect gems and avoid hazards along the way. Form some waves and chalk this one up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a challenging little game... and I do recommend it (specially since you can almost get it for free) ...But it definitely has its pros and cons. It's a great game to play while listening to your own music or a podcast, in that way, it is quite relaxing. The difficulty increases as you progress, but it's a lot of fun to go back to the first levels and realize that even though they are the same levels, the player has improved considerably and gained a lot of skill with no need for any type of ingame mechanics. In a way it's you, the player, the one who's leveled up. And that's something I really appreciate and find interesting. However, the game gets repetitive soon enough. I had planned to see the end of the game, but right before the final stages, you basically have to go all the way back and get better scores in every level for you to be able to carry on. As I said, that can be fun to do once or twice to see how you have improved, but to do them (almost) all again? To be honest, the game had already started to get quite tedious at this point and blocking the end behind a score didn't really help. Many casual players will probably see this as a burden, more than anything else. And I don't think Waveform appeals to a lot of hardcore players, as the reviews in steam show (as far as I can see not many have played more than an hour). So to sum it up:+ very cheap price+ interesting and original concept+ natural progression of player's skills+ relaxing and slow paced: perfect if you want to listen to podcasts or music while playing- ending blocked behind score requirements, forcing you to play almost everything again- quite repetitive			",294,108,1,50,22,3,48

												A unique arcade-style game which tries out a new concept and nails it, with surprisingly clever level design and a relaxing, surreal atmosphere. In this game, you don't control the character directly, but you control the shape of its path. The game's difficulty is determined by how you play it, being calming and easy if you just want to see the sights, and brutally hard if you're OCD for perfect scores.If you liked BIT.TRIP BEAT, or if you couldn't get into that game because of the difficulty, give this a try.

												This game is cool, but i not feel to recommend it, because of the mechanics, the wave is very difficult to control and you often don't exactly know in wich direction you're sending your little ship, the idea was nice but the game becomes with time too much irritating.My Final Score is 50 /100  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
