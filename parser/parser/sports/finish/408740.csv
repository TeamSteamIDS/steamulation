												Warning: DO NOT BUY!This game doesn't need a complex review, all you need to know is this: nothing matters!As far as I can tell, winning and losing are strictly random and take nothing that you've achieved, chosen or upgraded into consideration. Your stats don't matter, your equipment doesn't matter, your living conditions don't matter, and your choices during the games don't matter.If anything, the developer of this game has a sense of irony, encouraging players to grind and grind and grind for stats, gear, higher ranks, etc, while never achieving anything; just like real pro-gamers! Well played you sadistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!If you love butting heads against a random number generator or reading sub-par english then this is the game for you!Personally, I'd just recommend getting a pair of dice and screaming ""ODDS"" or ""EVENS"" at every toss...

												Summary: Nice idea, released too early.Pros:- Fairly original concept where you manage either a team or an individual in the world of e-sports- The cartoon-ish graphics is reminiscent of Game Dev Tycoon.Cons:- Very little information, particularly if you don't play Dota2 or CS.  For example, do you know what an AWPer is?  Tough luck, the game will never tell you.- There are tactics and player stats... that have seemingly zero effect on whether you win or lose a game.  It is completely random to the point where this may as well be a clicker game.- You can join a team but you'll never be picked (at least, I wasn't in the 3 hours I played) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At first I thought the game was similar to the Game Dev Tycoon, but I was VERY wrong. It follows the same art style, but that's where it all ends.- The game has NO TUTORIAL. Which means from the very first minutes of gameplay you have to figure out everything through trial and error.- No GLOSSARY OF TERMS. I like to play Dota2 on occasion and I haven't the slightest inclination to ever play a MOBA for anyhting but fun. I'm not interested in ranked stuff AT ALL. Thus, I hardly no any of the terminology that most active players know and use.- The game determines victory by coin toss. The stats and grinding in this game are pointless it doesn't affect the outcome AT ALL. This means that all the stuff you buy and learn are 100% useless.All in all, the concept is great but the execution is crap.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
