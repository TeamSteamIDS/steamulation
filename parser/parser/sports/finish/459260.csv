												This game is every bit as fun as it looks (if not more)!!If you've ever shot a bow before, the aiming sensation is surprisingly accurate to the real thing. The feel of whipping an arrow out of my quiver, slapping it on the rest, and drawing back the string all in a fraction of a second is incredibly satisfying! Makes me think I'm a bona fide archery master :)My friends and I have had a ton of fun switching off and just trying to outdo each other with trick shots in the playground mode. When you attach the spectator camera to the arrow and finally peg that apple out of mid air.... mhmmm, such satisfaction!			",35,10,3,7,8,5,4

												I played a bunch of the archery game from the lab, loved it, decided I needed more, and bought this. I am not at all dissapointed. The game is fantastic, and I'm sure it will give me plenty of playtime. It has 5 modes: Target practice, challenge, free shoot, endless, and juggling (where you try to keep apples in the air by continually shooting them). All of them feel great, and the game provides useful stats at the conclusion like accuracy, arrows fired, score and grade. The one complaint I have is that I wish it had some kind of a high score tracker - it doesn't need to be complex, but just some way of comparing your results against previous trials. That beign said, this is a great, well-polished archery game.EDIT: The dev implemented scoreboards, rejoice!			",107,30,5,18,41,2,30

												20mins game play max then it gets repetitive and boring. Feels like a gimmicky game trying to cash in on the new VR market with a 'just finished enough to pass' game. Handling of the bow and items is wrong, it warps the the hand of the person, you can't move around (walking or teleporting) or i just couldn't figure it, there is only one area/map and you do everything inside of it.Game modes are basically, shoot targets, shoot targets but with limited arrows, shoot targets against a clock, shoot apples, or shoot anything you want.I like the Lab version of archery, it has a little subsistence to it where you have to protect a castle. This is just shooting a bow.I also found out it's not very finished on the gameplay side as i could hold and nocked arrow against the string and throw the bow away from me while still holding the arrow. When you let go the arrow fires as normal through the arrow rest.I would not recommend this game, I would just play the Lab instead.			",250,31,2,27,65,1,29

												This game has probably the best bow mechanics of all the Vive archery games right now. The environment is pretty simple and the gamemodes are a little limited right now but what's there works really well, mechanically. The high score board keeps you coming back for more, trying to beat other people's scores as well as improve your own. The presentation is charming, the bow mechanics are excellent, and with more content & modes this will easily be the best archery experience for VR.			",134,25,1,14,26,2,26

												To me, having played Bowslinger before The Lab, I felt disappointed in Valve's Bowslinging.It has a totally charming environment, the bow and arrows feel so much more natural and accurate to me than The Lab demo.If you enjoy shooting a bow & arrow, buy this game!

												How to play 'Bowslinger' correctly.Step 1 - Uninstall 'Bowslinger'Step 2 - Install 'The Lab' for FREEStep 3 - Play 'The Lab's bow mini-gameStep 4 - Feel ripped off for paying $10 for less of a game than Valve's FREE minigame.Seriously, this game forgot to include the game. It has several modes. All of which are boring. Shoot stationary targets within a time limit; shoot stationary targets without a time limit; shoot an arrow at an apple repeatedly, and shoot ONE stationary target lots of times. There is no real GAME here. You have the protential in a VR game to throw in some random crazy fun stuff, and you didnt. Archery is fun. I know this because i do archery IRL and its great. This really isnt. You cant even enjoy attempting to master it as the controls are terribly poor. Overly complex given the simplistic nature of 'Bowslinger', meaning you miss fire or fail to load your bow far too often. Given the potential of the medium, this is just massively underwhelming and the bearest excuse of a game. If you want bow and arrow goodness use 'The Lab' or for gun and fun shooty goodness, have a look at VR Skeet, also free on Steam, and is able of how make stuff fun and entertaining if not realistic.TL;DR - Save your money and play the minigame in 'The Lab'. Much more entertaining.			",61,10,1,22,17,0,19

												I really enjoy VR archery games and bought this without hesitation. Unfortunately, there's not a lot to it, and even though I really like VR archery I got bored pretty quickly. The devs claimed they were working on an action mode, but now are totally silent on the subject, so there's not much to recommend at present. At least it's cheap.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There is almost no content here. Same enviroment the entire game, you can't even move out of the starting spot. Same patterns every round, game is more about memorizing than archery. Soundtrack consists of a single track. You can't really aim because it makes you want to place draw string to your face, but you have a headset on so you bash your controllers a lot. There are better and cheeper archery games out for Vive. Why buy this one?graphics: 4/10sound: 2/10replayability: 1/10fun: 1/10Only game I ever refunded.			",175,63,1,36,41,4,56

												I wish there were more bow types to mess around with, maybe like ones that are on fire, or drawing 2 arrows at a time, etc.The game is pretty fun but it lacks story or variety (in locations / enemies / modes / assets). It's actually kinda like pacman. A bit repetitive and only score based.Have fun for a couple hours or so.			",30,4,0,6,7,1,6

												The game has potential, bow mechanics in my opinion are the best compared to other VR bow games currently out. But its more of a demo vs a game worth paying more than $5 for. It gets boring quick, the only reason I have more than 10 minutes played is because my little brother has a fun time with it. ",56,7,1,2,7,3,0

												Bought it because of the positive reviews.... after 10-15 minutes or so there was nothing to do. sure it works and it is challenging to play but not engaging because there is no story or even scenario... this is just target practice.The lab is much more fun to do in it's simplicity			",158,31,4,19,30,1,41

												I think you should replace where you draw arrows from. The Lab does it pretty well. There were more than a few times where I'd go to grab an arrow and grab nothing, then go to shoot nothing. Whereas on The Lab I never miss.I found the best way was to press the grab button as soon as I let an arrow loose - but as I said, it's not always accurate.The game is great otherwise			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tried to shoot an apple off a dude's head, killed the dude instead, RIP :^(Needs more types of bows and green suits so I can feel like Mr Queen :^)In all seriousness though it's pretty juddery on the recommended specs, so it needs fixing before it can really be playable.

												I did not enjoy playing this game at all.  I would consider this game as a nice experiment in VR, but it has very little value as a game.  While the developers might improve it, nothing I've seen so far indicates that they're likely to convert this into a high quality title (though I could definitely be wrong, its just my feeling about it).- 1 of 10 stars when compared to all other games, including AAA games not made for Vive/VR.- 1 of 10 stars when compared to all other Vive games (available today).- $0 recommended value if the game does not improve much beyond its current state as of 7/10/2016.
