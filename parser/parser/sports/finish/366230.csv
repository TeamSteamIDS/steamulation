												Baseball Stars 2 is a very fun retro baseball game.  I don't believe I played this game back then, but I am very glad the game  is on steam and I have the privilege to play it.  I highly recommend this game to sports game fans and those who play casually.The gameplay is fairly simple, but yet at the same time has depth to it.  When pitching you can change the ball's path and/or increase the speed.  When batting you can move around in the hitters box to best position yourself to hit the ball,  You can also steal bases or prevent the player from stealing a base.  This is just some of the mechanics that you can do in-game, there is more that you can do.One gripe I have is there is no mid/between game saving.  When you enter a game mode you have to play against quite a bit of teams and the matches go on for quite a bit.  If you exit the game, that is it and you have to start all over.  This is a bummer because if you play in short bursts like I do, it can get frustrating because you potentially can't beat the game.  I am hoping some sort of saving will be implemented in the future.From an hours to price ratio, you will definitely get your money's worth and much more.Overall this is a very fun game, I haven't enjoyed a baseball game in a very long time and this hits the spot.  I hope this review helps.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have fond memories of this game from my arcade-obsessed childhood, but it just doesn't hold up all these years later. The controls are a pain, the AI is brutal and specifically designed to screw you out of your quarters, and every match is just way too long. You can't save your progress, so it's just about impossible to complete a full campaign. I will say that the game still *looks* awesome to this day. The character sprites are big and have tons of personality. The animations are fluid and muscular; every character, every play, every movement, every little visual insert has this cartoony energy and style that the Neo Geo always showcased so well. I also love how the supposed Korean and Japanese players are just these huge white people who happen to have names like Jae Bok. But these aesthetic elements are really where the appeal of the game ends. If you want to pick this up for nostaglia reasons or just to appreciate the cool graphics, I can certainly understand that...but for everyone else, you're most likely going to find Baseball Stars 2 really outdated, hard to control, and a frustrating slog that just isn't all that fun to actually play.
