												No, just no. Do not waste your money on this one. Spent 5 mintues playing with it a day quit. Just no content here worth buying.			",38,8,0,4,1,1,13

												It's not an early access, but it's very buggy and barely usable, and totally miss contents. I own Modbox (you can boxe with a bag) and The Thrill of the Fight, both are hugely better than this one. Unfortunately I can't suggest to anyone.			",133,49,10,4,27,5,10

												It's not that bad for what it is. I like the bag speed challenge. The strength challenge doesn't really work which makes sense as you aren't actually making contact with the dummy. If  Thrill of the Fight adds heavy bag and speed bag training this will be obsolete. Until then this is an ok option for a quick workout with a virtual heavy bag.  Heck it was under 7 bucks I think it's worth that.			",210,34,2,20,24,2,32
