Review as of April 9th 2016 (8.7 Hours Played)I'll update this review as the game changes.Summary:MXGP2 is better than its predecessor in a lot of ways but ultimately feels less realistic than the first game did.You begin the game on a stock 250cc bike (MX2) that can't clear anything and on realistic difficulty every NPC is faster than you. After upgrading some parts its a little better but it's not until you get on the 450cc (MXGP) that the game is fun. Even then, if you came to race AI NPCs you're going to be dissapointed. There is no bar banging like in the first MXGP. The NPCs don't make any attempts to pass or avoid you, they're very clearly on rails and don't fall down often. The pack never splits up like in real motocross or in the first MXGP, its just a horrifying train of bikes that take basically the same line for the entire moto. What's worse is that when they inevitably barrel into you from behind you WILL fall, and they probably won't. Still, when you aren't racing with unstoppable machines piledriving your swingarm into the dirt, the riding is a blast! Suspension feels nice and bouncy and cornering, although not as satisfying as the first game is a fun technique to learn. Furthermore, THE BERMS WORK NOW! You can absolutely RAIL some corners on the outside line, and what is motocross about if not railing corners? The suspension tuning and gear ratios do make a noticeable difference and I personally find it really fun to tweak with different setups while running practice laps. Anyway, this is getting too long so I'll get to the point. MXGP2 isn't great and it probably isn't going to get better but it is a realistic and fun experience in genre where only one new game hits the market every 2-3 years. If you're not interested in multiplayer, check out the original MXGP. If you're not interested in realism and just want to freeride dirt bikes with friends, go get MXvxATV Reflex. If you want to play a realistic motocross game with friends, I recommend this one.Developer Reputation:Milestone has made decent games in the past like Ride and the MotoGP series, unfortunately MXGP and MXGP2 don't live up to the same level of quality as their other titles. The first mXGP was released with a lot of bugs and support was ultimately dropped leaving the multiplayer unplayable and the game performance very low quality. I recommend that you take Milestone's poor history into account while reading this review. Hopefully I'm wrong, but it's unlikely that we will see any bugs being fixed let alone any requested features added to the game. The only DLC planned are additional rider gear and TWO more tracks, nothing to get excited over. Pros: Clutch & Manual Transmission Good first person view Great career mode Indoor stadiums! Plenty of customization Suspension setup presets can be saved Incredible replay feature (you can't save replays)Cons: Engine sounds bad 250cc isn't very fun AI aren't intelligent Colliding with AI means losing 10+ positions Odd player animations Air control take a lot of getting used to Only 4 indoor tracks...Current Bugs: Switching to Wheel settings freezes game in menu Changing the keybind for the clutch freezes game in menu Customizing rider or bike while in online lobby disconnects you from the match Audio goes completely quiet while taking sharp turnsVerdict: Apprehensively RecommendedThe first impressions of MXGP2 will leave you wanting a refund but after toying with bike tuning, upgrading to a 450cc and rebinding your controls, you'll learn to love it.The game is more polished than the first MXGP but feels less gritty and more arcadey.If you're looking for realism this game blows the MX vs ATV series out of the water standing as the ONLY decent offroad motorcycle game with manual transmission and clutch controls.This game wins most improved in a genre with very few competitors.The first MXGP is better and more fun in a lot of ways but this game feels more finished.If you're a fan of realistic motocross games and want to play alone, I recommend the first MXGP.If you want to play a fun motocross game with friends, get MX Vs ATV Reflex.If you want a realistic motocross game to play with friends, this is your best (and only) bet.P.S. Milestone please add more Stadium courses!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

PROSGameplay is more realistic when comparing to other motocross games such as Reflex, Alive, Supercross ENCORE, and MUD, etc. For example, you have control over the dirtbike's clutch, rear brake, front brake, and can shift gears manually. Also, use the left stick to control the bike and the right stick to control the rider's movements. All of these controls really matter as you approach certain parts of the tracks such as hairpin turns, berms, jumps, etc. Moving on, during a race, you have sessions such as practice or qualifying and then the actual race that conists of two heats. Scrubs and whips look pretty good. Use a Xbox controller to play.Career mode is great. Compete in MX2 and MXGP with up to 18 national tracks. Also, create your own custom team or join an official team. If you create a custom team, earn a reputation and sponsers. Either route you take, you must meet certain expectations of that team/sponser or be fired. For example, your sponser may ask that you gain a certain amount of points or do better than a competitor during the current race week. Each race has two heats (as stated before) with each heat offering a maximum of 25 points. At the end, you will either move up or down in the MX2/MXGP season rankings.BEST graphics seen for a motocross game. Check out my screenshot for example!

Customization is fun and awesome, but it would be nicer if there were more brands or things to choose from as far as gear goes and bike parts. I'm hoping for a modding community to start up to cover this.There is a lovely test track for you to play around on or test your new customized bike. You can now race on supercross tracks.The A.I. can be challenging. Overall, they can make you feel like you're having a battle or that you have to work hard for first place.There's cool stastitics tab within the main menu that shows your race results such as the number of times that you took first place, second, or third etc.2560x1440p support, the first MXGP did not have offical support of this resolution.There are some other neat modes like, ""real events"" that have you relive moments from real life MXGP 2015. Also, there's a game mode for monster energy FIM MXoN which is a ""team event scheduled at the end of the FIM Motocross World Championship, in which the riders compete representing their own country.""CONSThe A.I. can be an unstoppable force. In other words, they will knock you off of your bike easily if they touch you while turning. Also, the A.I. (all of them) take the same lines while racing. Overall, these two issues with the A.I. can make playing singleplayer extremely annoying or frustrating. When I tried multiplayer, the A.I. as well as real players were bugged. For example, the arms to their riders were moving awkwardly which was kind of distracting. I suggest racing without A.I. when online. Overall, the online gameplay was still playable. I had no lag issues. I've noticed that certain A.I. riders always finish in the top 10 or 5 which can make the gameplay feel repetitive since I always know who to expect behind me or battling with me.Falling off the track (even if you can easily hop back on) can reset your bike and rider making you loose your position in the race. Attempting to clear doubles or triples can feel/look akward or tough. The same goes for turning. There's so many hairpin turns in this game and so much lack of legit berms to rail. Sometimes I get really frustrated since I have to really slow down to make some of these turn otherwise I will turn so wide that I loose ground against the other racers. Overall, turning in this game can feel realistic and unrealistic at times.The sounds of the bikes are really terrible. Also, there's no great music within the menu or during a race. No real bands/singers or anything like that.OVERALLThis game is worth it if you are a motocross fan. I believe that MXGP2 is the BEST motocross game to come out SINCE Reflex. (I never liked the first MXGP). Please thumbs up if you found this review helpful! (=			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's one of the best mx games released, but they simply don't care about us (PC), we can't play online and I think we never will, the game will never get a patch to fix online problems. I will never buy again from milestone. EDIT:Well I'm tired of trying to fix this game. I have more than 80 games on my steam everyone of them works online, I never had any problem playing online games. So I conclude that this game is not playable FOR ME online, I know there's people playing but I've been trying for months to play online and I'm always getting disconnected ( lost connection to host). I have an Internet connection of 100mb, and high specs computer. It's not my fault it's milestone fault, so stop defending them. It's one of the best MX games I ever played, but it's a shame I can't play online. Even in motocross madness 2 I played countless hours online, and now in 2016 this game is beeing sold and I can't play online. what a jokeIf they fix the sound of the game and if they fix the lost connection to the host problem, for me, this would be the greatest game of motocross of all time. From mxgp1 to mxgp2 they improved a lot, but since is the same game just improved they must fix this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ sound.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game! Certainly not perfect. I would say 7 out of 10.Physics are not nearly as good as Reflex, but i havn't seen any game since to beat that. And contrary to all the negative reviews: they actually changed gameplay and added loads of new features. For example:- scrub/whip improved. Its still arcade style and not as good as Reflex, but it isn't the animation it used to be in the previous game. Its now fully under the players controls.- cutting off tracks, wich lead to lots of cheating online, is now fixed. This sometimes leads to sudden resets of the bike when you go off track. But i rather get used to riding on track, then have all the cheating.- Stadium tracks are added.- Lots of customazation of your bike is added.- You can now run your own team.- And quite a lot more new features...To sum up the pro's and con's.Pro's:- Great graphics, by far the best in its genre- All the original tracks, teams, names (to me this is worth a lot)- Loads of new features compared to the previous game- Changes, like whip/scrub control, make me feel that the developers did listen to the players requestsCon's:- Meh.... physics- Still the terrible engine sounds- Performace is great, but you've got to test quite a couple of settings before you find the right one- Still some bugs from the previous game, but no game changing ones			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(New review 16.06.2016! Please note that I haven't tried the game after the 9th June patch ) After 26 hours of this game I still find this game to be a DLC to the older game: I feel that game play is very similar and also the graphics. I think that they updated the tracks and the menus, but it doesn't make this game as a new one. This is something milestone has done several times and always gets away with it. The game itself: I still think that the game is great and I had a lot of fun when playing it, but there are some bugs, which are from the previous game. I don't like the teleporting, when you leave the specific track area by 1 meter and also I don't like the over and over gameplay which is nearly the same every time. The Ai is decent and can put up a great challengePros:+Gameplay+Ai+Performance with my PC*Cons-Bugs-Teleporting-New content compared to the older game-PriceOverall score 6/10*I7 4790k, 16gb ram and Nvidia gtx 980			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
