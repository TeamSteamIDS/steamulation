												At first blush, this may seem similar to titles from Armor Games, but this is much, much deeper and skill-oriented. Timing, variation, and eye-hand coordination are all a factor, particularly if you want to crush the built-in leaderboards. Great effort here and infinitely replayable.

												At first I thought this was going to be a game I wouldn't enjoy and I sort of maintained that mindset when I started playing but the more you play, the more the game feels fluid to you. I've slowly figured out how to get better combos and scores although I still don't think I'll be reaching the top of any of the leader-boards anytime soon (P.S Simon cheats).I'd highly recommend using a controller for the game. After starting with keyboard controls and then migrating to my Xbox 360 controller, you'll see what I mean.With changing daily levels and leader-boards, I think many people will come back every day to play the game. The music is also exceptionally awesome (although there is one track I don't really like but you can flick through all the tunes).			",1524,532,60,177,165,18,247

												This game is, in the 1st view, awesome. Great universe, great music, great gameplay, all is very cool.But more and more I go to the end (i am nearby the 100% of the game), the gameplay is very approximative. This is not very accurate.The buttons for spin is the same to put another type of grind, and if you hit the stick with 2 milliseconds of latency with the trigger, it doesn't count and you loose.When you begin the game it is cool, because it is easy, but when you make the final stages, the game is too imperfect, and if you win this is only because in this session the game didn't bug.Too bad, i love this game but it's very frustrating (i miss 4 stars).

												Played a lot on the Vita, but bought again to play on big screen (while waiting for the PS4 version!)Controls might be a bit difficult at the beginning, specially if coming from Tony Hawk, but once learned they are perfect, and are deep enough to keep improving and getting better scores. This learning curve might also be tough for some players, because it involves practicing many combos (flick movement on the left stick) and learning which of them score bigger than others. But this is really the key to high scores, know what to do, with enough variety and safety (and just doing ollies all along a level is not half the fun)On the downside, the Vita sticks are perfect for this game, small and short so flicks are super fast todo. While on the Xbox360 controller, the physical movement is longer (so slower to perform), and in my case as it is wireless it adds some lag, so have to press buttons earlier than on the Vita.

												Controls are not as responsive as they should be, especially in a game where timing and precision is key. This can often lead to frustrating gameplay where you feel like the game is difficult (not because of good level design but because of wonky controls). I wouldn't pick this up for full price.

												OlliOlli is a skill and timing based 2D side scrolling runner with a skateboarding theme. I say runner, because even though you're riding a skateboard, you can't stop. You're always moving to the right. Its an original take on the genre and a fresh skateboarder. I'm not sure this game is for everyone because of the genre and control scheme.The goal is simple, make it to the end of each level without falling off your board. You'll grind, jump and ride your board to the end. Just you. Getting to the end unlocks the next level. Each career level has five optional goals. Things like get X score or X combo. Jump gaps, collect spray cans, do a kick flip, only use one push or grind everything that needs girding. When you accomplish all five goals in an amateur level, it unlocks a pro level. Not only do the goals keep you in the relatively short levels, but you're rewarded for playing completing them. Outside of the career half of the game there is a ""spot"" half, with 25 more armature levels. These spots require you to do one long trick combination to the end of the level. There are 25 pro spot levels to compliment the amateurs.The challenge isn't avoiding obstacles, its the unique control scheme. To get speed, you need to push with the simple tap of a button. Two taps gets you up to top speed. Now for the tricky part. Instead of having a jump button, you use the analog stick to hold in one direction to charge the jump and release. So you flick the stick to jump. The direction you flick the stick determines the trick in the jump. There is a trictionary if you're looking for a specific trip, but I don't think it matters what trick you do. Your momentum determines the distance of the jump. You can even do quarter circles, half circles and so on to perform bigger tricks. Its elegant and simple yet complex and difficult to time because of how unique it is. When you are about to land the jump, you need to hit the land button, which is the same as the push button. If you don't push the land button, you'll land a ""sloppy"" which briefly stuns your rider by making him unbalanced. Getting stunned makes you vulnerable to falling off your board because you can't jump. Hitting obstacles or falling down a flight of stairs sends your rider tumbling a comical distance. In a way its a funny bit to tell you that you've failed, but in another way its a time wasting punishment. There are several grades to your landing depending how close to the ground you hit the button. A sloppy landing can make 20 trick combination worthless for point value. The grade of your landing not only determines the score you get for the combination, but it changes your momentum. A sloppy landing slows you down while a perfect landing will make you speed up.Outside of pushes, jumps and landings, there are grinds and twists. Twisting in air requires you to hold the button before you jump so your rider gets into position. I didn't find these necessary, but if you want a bigger score, you'll twist like its the 1950s. Twists are true risks and rewards, because you can fail the level if you mess up. Grinds are much easier. If there's a wall, railing or rooftop, just push the analog stick and hold it. Releasing it makes the rider jump as he normally would. Getting big combos relies on your ability to grind. Like with landings, you can score perfect grinds too, depending on how late you time your grind. Some of the later levels rely on your ability to make perfect grinds, because they keep your momentum going. Just know this is what you're getting yourself into.There is an easy to use, optional tutorial that explains all the controls. Everything gets explained one by one before the game makes you do them.There are five themes in OlliOlli each has its own color pallet. A grey urban, a brown pallet junkyard, a blue port, a snowy white base reminiscent of Rush'n Attack and finally the bright neon city. They are all beautiful, but they go by in an unnoticeable blur. I couldn't pay attention to anything other than was there a grind or a landing coming? As the levels get higher, the challenge grows. The base has safe pavement to land on, but a lot of it is snow that sends you tumbling. Its fun to grind over helicopter blades and statues instead of simple railings and walls. Neon city is mostly rooftops and railings to grind on, because the ground is either pink spikes or wide stairways.To keep you in the game there are daily challenges that let you practice as much as you want, but you only have one real attempt. Each level has its own leader boards after every attempt.  The game keeps track of your high score of each level and your best trick combination for that run. Truth be told, the game did freeze and twice crash in four hours after some completed runs. I assume because it was loading leader board standings and couldn't.The soundtrack is also a real standout. The lo fi electronic beats fit the art style. For the most part it felt like all mellow songs, but there is an eclectic mix of tunes. No matter what the beat, nothing got in the way and just added to the feeling of zoning out that I had while playing. The game became all timing with no thought. I just knew from playing that was the millisecond I needed to do something. After spending 20 - 30 minutes on some of the later levels of the amateur career, I could might be able to do them blindfolded.In the future I'd like to see different riders to unlock. Not that the rider was anything bad, but it was just him for the 4 hours I played. I am thankful for him having a red hat, otherwise he may have gotten lost in the blur of the background.In conclusion, its a fantastic presentation and a test of skill, but I'm not sure how fun the game actually is. I found my mind not as engaged as my reflexes were. I wasn't having any joy going through the motions. Although I did get a few laughs seeing my rider tumble down flights of staircases and seeing just how many meters he could go. Its still a good game, but after going through the armature career and spots, I'm just not that willing to unlock all the pro levels.			",1123,324,51,104,96,15,167

												Let's go in steps here.First of all, you probably need a controller to enjoy this game, even the game tells you that when you're opening it without your controller plugged in. I haven't tried playing with my keyboard, but with the controller you use your analog stick to do tricks, so it involves a lot of spinning it around in multiple ways and pressing buttons along to do all the complex stunts you need without really having to think too much about it. Simple to learn, challenging (in a fun way!) to master, as it offers a fulfilling variety of stunts of different levels that you can perform. Is this another one of those endless running / distance games?It involves distance, but it isn't endless. The game is comprised of ""stages"" with a number of goals you can accomplish in each of those. Each stage has a certain distance, to go to the next one, usually all you need to do is finish the stage in one piece. However, you also have the option of completing one or more of those multiple goals that each stage offers. Completing all goals in a level unlocks a new difficulty of that level, with even more challenges. So it's a bit different of the boring endless distance games that have been crowding the game market lately.Is there a story?Sorry, not really, but even though I love games with stories, I didn't miss in this case because the game mechanics keep you hooked init. It's actually very easy to completely forget about your goals even, just because you got so excited that you got like 10 perfects in a row and you want to see how far you can go.What else can you say about this game?As you're playing, you learn with your mistakes, so even when you fail it doesn't get frustrating, because you get that feeling that in just a few more tries you'll get it right. Some times you'll have to stop doing the stunts you tend to overuse, and pull different strategies and combos to get the objects in the field that you need to collect to complete a challenge. There's also a big variety of stunts you can perform, as well as the techniques you need to develop to get perfect landings, nosegrinds, to get better speed without having to put your foot on the ground to push your skate faster, etc.Yeah, it's a casual game, but I tell you, it's addictive. (I just spent 2 hours playing it nonstop, and had to stop myself because I had work to do, otherwise I would've kept going - even just writing this review makes me want to go back and play it a bit more!) My only sadness so far? I wish it had more steam achievs, I feel like this game has a lot of cool achievement possibilities, but sadly that wasn't well explored. At least we get cool in-game coals to achieve, though!			",779,366,24,104,98,9,126

												OlliOlli strips trick-based skateboarding down to its most exhilarating, addicting elements.It’s the practice and lead up to a perfect run; the repeated failure and experimentation over and over until finally you nail that perfect combo and the multipliers go crazy. OlliOlli takes that key moment and feeling that was pioneered, refined, and then beaten into the ground by Tony Hawk Pro-Skater, and removes all the fluff and needless bloat that began to weigh the series down the further it went on.Some of this is accomplished inherently by moving from a 3D sandbox to an always moving sidescroller, which immediately gives OlliOlli a great deal of originality. But developer Roll7 clearly knows and loves the games that built (and subsequently largely destroyed) the extreme sports genre, and borrows liberally the pieces that worked best from them to make a new, disturbingly addictive blend of mechanics.It’s Tony Hawk’s eccentricity, Skate’s organic trick system, and a whole lot of intelligent endless runner progression design. Performing tricks is as simple as flicking the analogue stick, but having to time your landings adds a considerable amount of risk versus reward to performing longer tricks when your movement speed is largely out of your control and it’s not always easy to predict what’s going to meet you later on in the level.OlliOlli can be absurdly difficult at parts, but it’s a challenge that I always felt prepared for. The goals for each level gradually introduce new moves into your skillset, and then gave me the perfect area to learn them. There’s a feeling of constant growth as you clear each level and the gradually climbs to counteract it, but also an understanding that for some players certain challenges will be out of their reach. OlliOlli never forced me to clear a goal or spend more time on a certain level than I wanted to, but it was so successful at instilling confidence in my ability to overcome whatever it threw at me that I rarely had any desire to move on before showing the game how capable I was.I did eventually abandon some levels, surrendering that I wasn’t quite as skilled as I pretended to be, but unlike a lot of games my experience wasn’t tarnished in any way for doing so. OlliOlli seems designed from the ground up to be as much as you want to put into it, and providing an awesome time whatever that is. The short levels are perfect for picking off in small bursts, and the addition of a daily grind which changes daily and gives a you only one chance to hit your best score, gave even more reason to return to the game instead of trying to plow through it all at once.My biggest frustration with OlliOlli actually doesn’t have anything to do with what’s here, but the disappointing absence of a convenient leaderboard. You can track your score and compare it with others in any level you choose, but instead of being prominently displayed it’s put on a separate screen completely removed from gameplay. For a game so perfectly designed for chasing high scores (you even unlock score focused “spots” after clearing each level once), having something like Geometry Wars 2’s immediate tracking of leaderboard positioning and your next score to beat would have been far more compelling a motivator for me to chase my friend’s best scores.That may matter more or not at all depending on your feelings toward competing on leaderboards, but it’s at least telling that my only major issue with OlliOlli is in something it lacks (and even then, it’s more the implementation than complete absence of a feature). It’s a game so precisely tuned and refined that I found myself becoming lost for hours at a time repeating levels attempting to best my prior run. It gave me a sense of accomplishment and elation at expertly executing a sequence of tricks I haven’t felt in a decade, and reminded me why I’m so sad games of this nature were killed off by their own insistence on flooding the market and deluding themselves with features nobody wanted. OlliOlli suffers from none of that. It’s pure, sublime skating perfection.On the PC version:While the PC version of OlliOlli is content complete to its Playstation 4 and Vita counterparts, the port has sadly suffered a great deal in the transition. I experience a significant amount of technical issues, from dropped frames, persistent slowdown, leaderboards crashing the game, and a generally lower level of responsiveness than a game so reliant on timing needs. It wasn’t so bad I was unable to enjoy the game or play it successfully, but if you have the ability to play it on another platform it might be advisable to do so.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												Borrows a bit from THPS and a bit from SKATE, but still is able to form a unique skateboarding gameplay experience. Timing-based scoring system (Perfect! Sick! Sloppy! Sketchy!) makes for a solid ""perfectionist"" type of challenge, yet one not exactly punishing at early levels. Animations are pretty choppy and the character art (while often charming, such as the bails) is unrefined and downright ugly at times. Kickflips and heelflips for example, are visually indistinguishable, and for a 2D game, good sprite work and animation seems like a pretty important thing. Doesn't really have that skateboarding ""feel,"" but a solid game nonetheless.			",213,35,2,14,19,1,19

												This is not Tony Hawk Pro Skater, and I'm happy it's not (well, kinda). Coming from a background in THPS games, I kind of expected this to follow in the same path, but by changing the way in which you control your skater and putting a greater influence on perfect rail tricks and landings (rather than balance), a whole new fun experience has been created. To start, it can take many attempts just to make it to the end of each level. Then once you do, you need to make the scores required along with other little challanges. I've logged a few hours in the game and have gotten the hang of it, for the most part. I'm still no where as good as I need/want to be and that will keep me coming back for more. Oh, and the daily grind challenge where you only get one chance.....EVIL!! (but fun)			",2289,955,105,232,280,28,358

												I didn't know what to think or expect with this game before I played it. If you like challenging games that get you try and re-try until perfection, this is it. The tricks are easy to start, but developing skill is an entirely different thing. This is a game where you're going to have to practice and become skilled at what you're doing, which is something I understood the moment I completed the tutorial and tried the first level. It's satisfying when you finally do what you wanted to do or clear the goal you've been trying to clear for the past several minutes. I definitely recommend a game pad with this, as it brings that EA Skate stick control to the game and you can get a better feel for doing the tricks. The music is fantastic. It's a nice blend of mellow Hip Hop (sampled or synth) and it helps take the edge off when playing. If you like skateboarding, you'll like this. If you like challenge, you'll like this. If a rage quit is something you're fond of, you'll like this game.My only hope is the developer considers adding character customization to the game.			",163,48,9,30,23,4,24

												Absolutely excellent little game.One of the most common things you'll read about it elsewhere on the internet is that it's really hard. This is true-- but OlliOlli's difficulty is fair, fun, and rewarding. Landing tricks is legitimately difficult and feels great. After a few play sessions, you should really start to feel yourself improving.The controls are extremely simple-- left analog stick to line up a trick, 'A' button to push against the ground or land the end of a trick combo. Tricks are controlled by the directions you push the left analog stick. Releasing the stick causes your character to jump in the air and attempt the trick. Sweeping the stick around in a circle will line up a more complicated trick, based on the distance and direction you sweeped it. The only way to get credit for a trick or a combo is to tap the 'A'button quickly just before you hit the ground. The closer to the ground, the better multiplier you get.Overall, the system is simple and rewards practice. Chaining together a long combo is quite difficult, and you'll have to chain some pretty ridiculous ones to complete all the objectives in each campaign level.Speaking of levels-- the ""Career"" campaign has several ""acts"" with eight tracks each-- four easy, four hard. Each act has its own art style. There's also a ""Spots"" mode, where you get to execute precisely one combo before the level ends. Extending that combo gets you more points and a better spot on the leaderboards. The final game mode is the ""Daily Grind."" It provides a single randomly-generated track that you only get one chance to set a score on. So far, the Daily Grind I've tried has been quite hard.I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys twitchy, timing-based platformers or arcadey, combo-centric skill games. Not for the weak of heart, but ultimately accessible to anyone with a gamepad and the will to improve.It's also worth mentioning that the soundtrack is excellent.			",294,130,1,49,41,1,38

												I find the prospect of having to ride on a board with wheels under it a very, very terrifying experience. There are many ways I can fall off that board, and I imagine all of them have to do with something like falling onto a turd or a water hydrant or onto a set of figurines that are participating in a heated battle of Warhammer 40,000 on the sidewalk, where I will pierce one of my internal organs on a Tyranid and have to explain to God when I get to the pearly gates why I am such an ultra-wuss.OlliOlli captures some of that terror because it has a difficulty curve that's steep as hell, like learning how to ride an actual skateboard. The tutorial could have been better (for some reason I couldn't actually figure out how to do Perfect Grinds until I just said '♥♥♥♥ this' and played an actual level, where I slowly figured it out on my own, but I think that's more of my blatant inattentiveness than the tutorial's fault), but the real learning experience is pretty much about getting better and faster at the game, and learning how to squeeze in more tricks between grinds for higher scores or for unlocking bigger, better levels. If you want to unlock those ""Pro"" levels, you gotta ♥♥♥♥ing earn your keep. Once you get in the groove of actually starting to pull off sweet moves and getting in the habit of varying what moves you pull off, the game opens up dramatically and challenges you even more.Despite OlliOlli's semi-'thrown in the deep end' type of tutorial, it gets its vibe right. The soundtrack is the perfect thing to grind to, and the controls are a bit finicky but the way they are built allows for effortless cool stunts between jumps. It looks cool and I bet you will not be called a nerd if you show people how you can do a 1080 Backside Flip-It to people on the bus without losing. It's Super Meat Boy hard - you will break your knees and ankles so many times before you can finally pull off that grind-flip-grind-twist-grind-perfect landing combo, and it will feel glorious. If you can beat all the Rad levels, I bet you can show someone at the interview for your next job and you will get that job.Personally (oh no! Personally, the verboten word in video game reviews), I'm not a fan of these endless hardcore trek-up-Death-Mountain challenges, and OlliOlli didn't change my mind. But I like what it's doing enough to recommend it.			",448,99,7,53,31,2,53

												Brings what I loved about Tony Hawk's Pro Skater to a side-scrolling perspective. It gets crazy-hard; I wish there were some more levels in the middle that could be completed after a few tries. The combo system is fun, but difficult to master. There are four directions for tricks, a timing-based landing system, and two buttons for spins. You have to be alert for the entire length of each level (around 2 minutes) to meet the objectives. Getting to the end counts enough to get to the next level, but ""pro"" levels only unlock when you meet all five objectives.			",170,85,8,10,15,3,29

												This game is awesome. On the PlayStation Vita.It's good enough to recommend for PC, but it does have a weird control lag that the Vita version doesn't have, and a complete lack of display options beyond resolution, leading to tons of screen tearing if you run it full screen. So it's rough, but it's still really fun. If you don't have a Vita, get it on here. If you have a Vita, dust that paperweight off and get it on there instead.			",492,199,8,45,32,3,52

												If you liked stringing together combos in Tony Hawk Pro Skater, this is the game for you. It takes the combo mechanic and makes it the center of attention. It will seem very difficult when you first play, but it's a game that you get used to over time. I would recommend this game to people who like fast paced gameplay. This is truly a game that is easy but very difficult to master.			",444,117,9,43,36,6,61

												OlliOlli is a 2d skateboarding game that bares similarities to the gameplay of now defunct developer Black Box skateboarding game ""Skate"". The basic control scheme is all there, you have your left analog stick quarter circles, full circles and point analog at said direction to pull off a variety of combo skateboarding tricks and grinds. Sure it doesn't have any of the crazy stunts of a Tony Hawk like 720 shove it-to -superman-heelflip-whatever but pulling off chain combo in OlliOlli has just the degree of difficult and requires just the amount of skill that pulling them off will give players an equal amount of gratification when done properly. Players progress in challenge latened levels where either collecting, pulling off x amount of combos, or reaching a certain amount of score will progress you to the next level and ultimately to more difficult challenges. When it comes to presentation OlliOlli 2d pixelated art style helps sets it apart from the more well known 3D skateboarding franchises by giving the game a indie feel very reminiscent of underground skateboarding back in the day. This feeling is reinforced by the music that not only helps set the tone but remind players the variety and diversity skateboarding is. There's a level of cool brought to this game simply by choosing these aesthetics. A few issues I had with this game was primarily on the mechanics side where the initial timing for the landing of tricks require players to press a button at the right time to pull it off perfectly. This window to press the button is fairly short and requires you to pay attention to how far your board is to the ground. This can prove an issue because like other 2d endless runners before it if you aren't paying attention to the screen correctly your character may blend into the background which can prove troublesome.  Failing to pull off the perfect landing on a trick can be the difference between getting 100k score on a perfectly run level to 20k score on a poorly runned one. Overall if you ever had an interest in skateboarding games or were interested in this game when it initally came out on Playstation Vita but didn't have the hardware to play it, I think this is a game worth picking up.

												Kicks♥♥♥♥♥ is a ton of fun and hard as nails. You'll need a controller and good nerves. It's a mix between endless runners like CANABALT, Super Meat boy and the Tony Hawk franchise. The look is a bit uninspired, with very basic visuals but everything is in some way neatly color-coded so you'll know where to grind and where to jump. The soundtrack ranges between smooth bar jazz and dubstep with drops as big as the one in level 5-5.The 10,99€ Price tag seems steep and could be under 10, but i can't complain. i played more then 13 hours and come back now and then for more, just because it's a fun, easy and fast way to kill time and to pull of some cool looking combos.Get it! if not now, then on sale.

												Although I suck at this game, I had great gun and still have great fun playing it. The soundtrack is to die for and the skateboarding itself handles perfectly. To me, if any game can make me want to continue playing even though I keep failing than that game is doing something right. OlliOlli does everything right. I would recommend using a controller though and putting on your game face, as I think commentating and using a keyboard may have helped me fail. May :P			",322,82,9,27,29,3,21

												You NEED to play this game published by the same people who published the critically aclaimed Hotline Miami. It has the biggest variety of tricks and moves EVER seen on a skating game, and an astounding soundtrack which fits the style of the game. The graphics are simple but lovable and they show a hipster, urban atmosphere. Mix that with the hilarious fails, the leaderboards and the combo counter and the end result is an addictive fun game, which is worth the price.Other features include a world ranking, various objectives and daily special stages, all of which keep the desire to improve your score. In addition, OlliOlli is really challenging and uses a simple but hard to master sistem, and you will find yourself restarting the mission in various ocassions.There were some issues with the game, but using the FAQ from the community worked out and i managed to make it work. Although i think the game is good, it could have been better by adding a customizacion option, a multiplayer mode or more levels.			",39,3,1,1,1,1,0

												When I initially bought this game I wrote a negative review only after an hour of gamplay. Since then I deleted my review to take another stab at this game. I owed it to myself and to anyone reading this review. My biggest issue with the game was the controls are extremely difficult to master for the casual gamer like myself. I have recently logged an addictive 10+ hours playing this game. The controls are NOT easy to learn but when you do master them, this game gets extremely fun and challenging. Overall, I would reccomend this game!Buyer BEWARE!  there is a learning curve on the controls. Take the time to learn them and you will really enjoy this game!!			",24,9,0,0,0,1,0

												OlliOlli perfectly coalesces modern game production sensibilities into a relentlessly polished experience, creating a sure-to-be-classic skateboarding game. The soundtrack alternates between energetic and groovy, setting the tone for ""this run will be the one"" moments. Controls are effortless, tight, and really evoke the physical motions of each trick. Unfortunately, on some levels not all the surfaces are seamlessly bounded which can cause some frustration when tricks fail to land that are otherwise timed perfectly.Career mode's challenges will gradually teach the high-scoring techniques necessary to succeed in the game's harder modes, offering challenges that both the casual and the hardcore gamer can enjoy. Still, it is the hardcore arcade enthusiasts that will really reap all the rewards OlliOlli has to offer as they vie for top position on the high score list while mastering the nuanced trick controls.

												I had Actually heard of this game a few years ago, I wanna say on mobile? I could be wrong, None the less it looks fun and awesome so lets get into it, OlliOllie is a fun 2d scrolling Skateboarding game, thats sort of like Tony Hawks Pro Skater, and at the same time while Its no Tony Hawks Pro Skater its about as good of a 2D version as your going to get, The Controls take some time to get down especially sticking the landings, The game has missions just like Tony Hawk games did and they are competed in the same way, I had a lot of fun and frustration playing this game, It is definently harder and more challenging than Tony Hawk, One thing I would like to see added is special moves, maybe customizable skaters? And if not that maybe a choice of a few different ones with different states, for example Johnny is a goofy foot who Grinds well, Timmy is regular foot but he can jump higher ETC.The Colors and artwork are nice, no complaints here, and the levels look different enough.Steam Workshop levels would be kick♥♥♥♥♥tho.The music is good and keeps up to pace with the game.Over all I played this thing for hours in fun and Frustration.The tutorial was well done, and the gameplay works.The game made a sequel and from what I hear it is pretty damn good too and has some major improvements as well.After also looking at OlliOlli 2 I can see they improved very much so on the mechanics, Both games are honestly fun and great and worth picking up.Pros:+ Sweet Music+ Fun Game+ Its like a 2D Tony Hawk+ It's Challenging+ It Has Achievements+ It Has Controller Support+ Multiple LevelsCons:- Controls take some time to get used to- Game can be hard & Frustrating- No Trading CardsThis review is a part of Steamified's Community Reviews program and the credit goes to Steamified for providing the key for review purposes.For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/.

												Don't judge a book by its cover, and in this case - don't judge a game by its visuals. Despite the already incredibly high standards within the skate genre, OlliOlli has managed to ingrain itself in videogame skateboard history with its unique but familiar take on what many consider as a lifestyle.Whilst it's no Tony Hawk's Pro Skater in terms of the tricks players will be performing, it still channels inspiration, with an extensive combo system. It draws on the SKATE series at the same time, with various hard-to-master but ultimately satisfying game mechanics. Sure, you'll probably bail way too often to begin with, but stick to it and you'll find a deeply rewarding and finely tuned skateboard game experience that has hours upon hours of replay value.If you're a fan of the skateboarding genre - get this now. And if you're not, get it anyway. You won't be disappointed.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm enjoying this a lot. There was a lot of Tony Hawk Pro Skater muscle memory to unlearn though. You basically do everything with the left analog stick and use the A button on the xbox controller to push/land.I did have some trouble landing perfect grinds. I'm not sure if it's possible to land a grind too late, that might be the cause of it. EDIT: I was using a wireless controller which was the cause for that.I can pull off perfect grinds pretty consistently now. The weird thing is that you can get perfect grinds by grinding at the last possible moment but that doesn't seem to be the case for landing on the ground, I have to press a bit earlier for that.
