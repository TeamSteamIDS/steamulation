Early Access Review
								About five years ago, I got in a skiing accident that left me unable to ski. No, it didn't quite ' Cripple ' me, it more left me unable to ever truly put stress on my knee again. For those who ski and snowboard, you know the ability to do so is paramount to actually staying on the damn things.I found this game just today, watching funny little youtube videos, coming across a bunch of guys messing around with it. While it illicited some laughs, I was interested. ' What is this game? And why the hell has it been under my radar this whole time? '.After about a half an hour of playing it, I can say it's decent. It's free. The ragdoll physics give me a laugh or two, and the first person doing a 720 left me breathless.Thank you for giving me my hobby back, at least in this form.			",297,33,0,26,23,1,29

Early Access Review
								What was a crazy fun game about screwing around on a few mountains in super-early access has turned into a F2P purchase-fest. Backers got to play one version of the game, and now that version has been subsumed by transactions and glitchy features and collision. Maybe don't impliment a cash shop until your UI is in one piece? I managed to accidentally buy 3 copies of the same pants, exhausting my early-access founder ""funbucks"" currency. Not keeping track of this game anymore, which is a shame, because it started off feeling an awful lot like a laid-back SSX with drones and a sandbox approach.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS. This game use to be good, when it first came out on early access. I even paid for the founders pack. the physics, speed, and style of this game are not there anymore. Micro transactions are the meaning of this game now. For example, i would log in when i first got it, and have 20 different styles of jackets. Now i have two, and one of those are from the founders pack. But if i spend 1699 in game credit, i get one outfit with a set of skii's. I use to spend hours on one part of the mountain, trying to see what i could acomplish on that section. Now i cant even stand playing the game for a few minutes without getting bored. This game may be good for someone looking to throw money at a company. But someone who has been following the game since the beginning, just like many others sadly might want to do too, i have to give it a 1/10. As for now, this game will just be one of many i scroll past looking for a game to put time into, and not money.			",387,53,43,35,84,6,64

Early Access Review
								I got this game after binge watching snowboarding films ( Its January and no hills in Scotland have any snow, I need my fix... ) and deciding to check steam for SSX, NO SSX on steam but it does have this early access game. To say the least I was intrigued. Before I go any further theres a couple of questions you will need to ask yourselfDo you love snowsports? Did you love SSX 3 and SSX  ( the newer 1 )? with its freeroamy goodnessDo you want to experience what pulling a 1080 feels like in first person? Can you afford to go snowboarding in other countries? ( I can't :( IF you answered yes to any of the first 3 questions and no to the last one then this game is for you. IF you answered yes to the last question then what are you doing on your PC? book that holiday to Tignes, Mayrhofen or where ever and do it for real. Read on for a more descript review Still reading? Good now lets break this downGraphics - The graphics are great, I mean its a freeskiing/snowboarding game so theres no explosions or anything fancy just fantastic looking mountains and pistes. The snows nice with persistent trails from your previous runs and the characters look well textured which is just as well cause you need to show off that fancy piece of kit you just plowed your hard earned credits into. Gameplay - The game is split into offline and online and in either of them you can choose to do events or freeroam. The events cover pretty much every category of skiing and snowboarding with time trial, freestyle etc... and the freeroam... well lets just say your plonked onto whichever part of the mountain you want and you go from there. At the time of review there is 1 mountain and several big air parks, don't let that put you off, the Mountain is huge ( of course it is, its a mountain ) The skiing itself seems fine but can be a little funny at times with some quirky bugs. I started a run and my character was stuck in the Jesus pose until I respawned or the fact that if you crash your body ragdolises as if you were made out of rubber.  I need to mention as well this game plays like a simulation so theres no insane tricks that make your ski's pop off and fly around your head before magically reattaching..... looking at you SSXMusic - The music is good, it could be better with some extra tunes and maybe some from that previous SSX game but the music they do have is chosen well for the snowscene. It would be good to see the total tracks or be able to skip them as a couple of times during freeroam its played the first track and then stopped. If anyone has been on a mountain without any music they know what thats like. Theres always steam music tho i suppose  Customization - The customization in this game is snow joke ( I had to ) This is where the game really shines, at the time of this review I am eagerly awaiting the release of the snowboarding part of the game however from looking through the items just for skiing theres is a HUGE amount to pick from. You kit your character out from head to toe literally, Chose hats,helmets,goggles,jackets,trousers,boots,skis,poles face masks & even bindings. Each of these categories have recent kit from most of the popular brands such as K2, Scott & Head to name just a few.Multiplayer - I actually haven't played much of multiplayer, my first attempt was met with huge lag. Second attempt and I saw 1 other person on the mountain which i followed in the hopes of showing my mad skills to. got ahead of him and prepared to hit a kicker unfortuntately I ended up hitting him and we both bailed. Which would of been fine but for some reason in multiplayer you can only restart at the top of the mountain and not where you bailed. Needless to say he bailed from the game. The developers are aware of the connection issues and are trying to improve it so hopefully it will be sorted soon as this is an integral part of the game, Imagine you and a couple of buddies on the side of the hill with a kicker taking turns at hitting it. For me that sounds perfectTo sum things up this game has huge potential, they are adding in snowboarding soon and If they add in the same amount of gear for snowboarding as they have for skiing I will be a very very happy person. As with any early access game theres still a long way to go. However again I highly recommend this game for any fan of snowsports or the SSX games.Some things i would like to see in the released game.Ability to get off skis/board and wander around + the ability to spawn in objects & move them ( such as ramps, tables etc ) for limited amounts of time to make your own jibs etc kinda like what SKATE hadIf you use a chair lift can we maybe be able to sit and watch from it as we go back up ( with the ability to skip ) sounds boring but its actually quite entertaining seeing whats going on from them especially when people bail :pSnowmobiles, currently used much like the chair lifts when you interact they take you to certain spawns instead maybe when we use them we could actually drive them to where ever. Would open the game up alot more.Weather and snow conditions - Everyone loves a bluebird day however in Scotland getting a bluebird day is a rare thing and i presume its the same for places everywhere else? Stoked had a fantastic weather system with storms that altered the snow conditions. It would be great to see the same thing done here Mountains - More mountains... can never have enough mountains			",117,9,6,19,23,1,25

Early Access Review
								I can't believe how many bad reviews this game got. It's ridiculous. Espescially seeing all the complaints about things like speed and physics when in reality this game has WAY more realistic speed and physics than any other snow games out there like SSX Shaun White Snowboarding etc. All those games have horrible physics and DO NOT replicate real life snow sports what so ever. The funny thing is I have snowboarded all my life and didn't even care much for skiing, so I was dissappointed that snowboarding isn't in the game yet, but I went ahead and purchased anyways because I couldn't wait any longer since there are no other games out there like this one. Long story short this game actually made me like skiing for the first time ever in the 18 years of my life of being a snowboarder. I've also been waiting for a game like this forever literally. NO COMPANY has ever made a snow sports game so realistic. I needed a game like this so badly and it's finally here. So here's my review:Pros:- Very realistic physics. (Speed going uphill is a little bit off when tucking since you barely slow down but is not a problem because it allows you to find more lines. Going downhill is perfect. Please do not change it devs, do not listen to idiots.)- All tricks are realistic as well. (You can finally cork your spins. Never have I ever played a snow game that I could actually pull a double cork 10 that looks exactly like it's done in real life. In Shaun White Snowboarding the closest thing to a cork is a rodeo...no corking was implemented in that game... like wtf.)- Real life brand clothing and gear replicas. (Armada, Head, etc.)- Real life event replicas. (Nine Knights, Jon Olsson Invitational, etc.)- Real Life sponsers. (Red Bull, Monster, etc.)- Vast mountains to explore, and I mean it. The current mountain Sialia actually takes about 10 minutes real life time to get from top to the bottom at full speed making it very realistic. Also this mountain is ski - able in all directions, North, East, West, and South. Each direction has different types of terrain, including a terrain park, my favorite, that takes about 4 minutes to get down. -Lots of cool different lines you can take. The whole mountain has lines hidden away for you to find. Above I mentioned the terrain park which has multiple different directions you can take that lead you into different parts of the terrain park and back into the same parts if you wish. The choice is yours as there are so many variations to this terrain park it's truly endless fun.-Legit first person view (It literally looks like real life in first person view when you're corking a spin.)-Free 2 play coming soon. (People complaining about microtransactions yet the whole base game is free. The only thing you get if you buy into the microtransations is cosmetics and vanity. You don't gain any advantages to your character in terms of speed, power, or skills. NO PAY2WIN here. The skill is in the players hands.-Devs are super friendly and helpful and respond very fast to any problems or bug reports. (I submitted a bug report and got a response within the first day and then I responded again because I didn't give accurate information and they responded within minutes.) Most importantly they actually listen to their community.Cons:-Few bugs. (Sometimes your character bails even though he landed perfectly, which happens very rarely like 2 times in a 4 hour session. Not a big deal) (Skiing switch in first person is a little buggy since the shoulder gets in the way when tucking. Not a big deal.) Sometimes when you spawn on a drop point you get stuck until you respawn again. (Not a big deal.) (Games crashes in multiplayer sometimes as well as desyncs, which kind of pisses me off but I sent in a ticket and  devs noted these crashes and are working on fixing them, also new servers are coming very soon.)-Price of gear is just a little bit expensive but I have no problems with this at all since there is no advantage to owning this stuff. The game is free on January 27th and I will buy some just to support the devs. Obviously they can't just work for free.-Not enough advertising. I really want to see this game succeed but I only heard about this in December, yet it's appearently been out for 3 years now. I had to search deep to find this it was literally like digging for gold and hitting the jackpot. I was stuck with all these other ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games for 3 years when I could have been playing this.Summary:If you are like me and are looking for a snow sports game that actually replicates real life skiing and snowboarding, then this is the game you're looking for. This is the game you have been waiting your whole life to play, but couldn't because it was buried in a search engine full of bullsh*t. Do yourself the favour and don't waste cash on all these mainstream AAA garbage games made in China. You'll just come right back here realizing how much of an idiot you were to even bother looking at them.Hope you guys find my review useful. Thanks. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								Update: The game now has sound and effects like ski trails etc. The controls are rough and movement still need balancing though.Definitely has the best feel of a modern snow game. The game is in alpha, there is no sound, yet I still enjoyed every second skiing down the mountain. If you like skiing you will love this even in its unfinished state. It can only go up from here.Edit: So I'm going to add a little more to this review because apparently people are actually reading it.Here's what you can complain about: Lack of sound and snow effects. Sound's no big deal, just play some of your own music in the background for now. It's the effects that really throw everything off. Your character is basically just on the mountain, as of right now there's no interaction between the skis and the mountain; no tracks, no little specks of snow going everywhere as you might expect from skis in snow. But I'm sure that's in the works, and honestly once the sound and those little effcts are in the game is more than recommendable if you enjoy the winter sports. There's a little bit of a learning curve but I'd venture a guess and say it's easier to learn to play this game than actually ski.Earlier today they put out a big update and really cleaned up a lot of the UI. The menu isn't all over the place and flicking out of view and they have the basic framework down for the multiplayer. It's looks really promising.Now of course there's bugs here and there, the previous update completely broke the options menu but I have yet to encounter any crashing while actually playing the game itself which is something.As I'm writing this there are no negative reviews so that should tell you that yes, if you're unsure whether or not  to buy it and it seems interesting, but you're afraid it won't turn out great down the road; I'd recommend it even in it's current state.

Early Access Review
								If this were a month ago, I'd give it a thumbs up. Now? No. The latest update - the ""Beta"" update on March 10th completely changed the game from something good with lots of potential to.. something that feels less like a game and more like a cash grab. They've added microtransactions for any sort of cosmetic item. Anything that one could originally use on their character for free in the Alpha has been put behind a paywall. As of now, you can only get these items through purchasing a ""credit pack"" and getting them that way.The developer says that they will eventually add ways to earn these items in the game, but to release a major ""update"" with the microtransactions in-game for people like myself who already spent money on said game is a red flag. I know that the developers need to make a living and game development isn't cheap. On their forums, a developer has said that it was economically unwise for them to charge $15 or so for the base game and have everyone unlock the gear from the start - thus the microtransactions. However, I fail to see why exactly this business model has been adapted - it would have been much easier to just increase the price of the game accordingly - instead of adding a microtransaction system.Again, I realize that the developers need to make a profit. That's fine - but the current business model is not the best way to go, and if a drastic, negative change took place from Alpha to Beta, it makes me skeptical about what the future holds. Only time will tell. However, as of now, the game does not appear to be something worth investing in.			",268,24,15,27,49,1,38

								As a skier, this game is a dream come true. I didn't want to pay 60$ for Steep, so I got this instead. Lo and behold, its an amazing game! I definantly recommend this game to anyone who likes exploration.PROS:-Really good controls, if you have a controller -Hilariously fun, especially when your dead body flails in the air after you hit a tree at 50 MPH-A HUGE open world, which has lots of secrets and cool little easter eggs to find-Just skiing around feels exciting-Tricks are so fun to pull off and try and land-The challenges and events are fun to do when exploring the mountain gets boring. (Which doesn't happen a lot)-Music is great, and sounds like what skiers listen to.-Many other things you just need to play and see!-Its FREE!CONS:-Keyboard and mouse controls are eh-The soundtrack, while great, only has about 10 songs that get repetitive-All of the cool customization is pretty much pay wall locked, but its a free game so-My biggest gripe with the game is that the mountain feels lifeless. The lack of NPC's makes the mountain feel depressing. I wish there were skiers you would have to avoid and ski past, it would add life to the game. Adding individual trail names would add a sense of realism as well. Real ski mountains have things like that that would just add life to the game.-There is some clipping with objects that is a little annoying-Some animations, such as grinding, just look dumb at the moment ",52,1,0,2,3,0,2

								Snow has good graphics and also good multiplayer. Snow is also fun to play and if you are a person who likes skiing or snowboarding, I would recommend you try this game your self. One thing I strongly recommend is you use a controller to make it easier to play. There are a few bugs and glitches they need to iron out yet but there not that annoying. Accessories cost credits. In order to get credits, you can level up to earn them or buy them for cheap prices with money. You can either snowboard or ski and also drive a snowmobile. You can spawn on top of a mountain and try to make your way down. You can go to parks and pull off your tricks.  I recommend trying this game out :).			",36,1,4,2,10,0,0

								As much as I'd like to reccomend this game to others.... I can't really understand how a game went from ""ok"" to ""bad"" game with the updates. I bought the game as launch and remember having fun playing it. But now the game constantly crashes for me, they added micro-transactions and they made the movements worse than what they were in the beggining... I also have to add that the biggest part of the fun (with the launch version) was to explore the mountain with the ""cheating mode"" that was a mode you activated while pressing F1 and could drop your character anywhere you wanted on the mountain. Well... they took this mode out.... Will play again when the game is going to be fun and playable but for now it's getting worse and worse with every updates			",151,32,5,18,10,1,1

								It's a really fun and calming game, but there a pretty fair amount of glitches. The most frustrating ones (in my opinion, of course) being landing but your snowboard or skis get stuck in the snow then you just die, and just not being able to land jumps even though you should be able too.

								I've been playing this game for almost a total of 260 hours now and still have only found one bad thing. The game overall is smooth, has amazing gameplay, and is easily enjoyed by anyone and especially enjoyed by people who ski or snowboard in real life. The only problem I have is the glitch that starts in around 250 hours which doesnt let me play as much because it closes the game randomly. I would reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys skiing and snowboarding and likes winter sports.			",3,0,0,3,1,0,0

								I honestly don't understand the praise this game recieves from the top reviewers. So many people talking about how polished and smooth the gameplay is and just how great it is. I mean, the game definitely has some good aspects. The graphics are beautiful, the maps are huge and filled with things to do and explore, and there are a lot of cutomization options, challenges and events. From the outside, it does seem like a great game. The more I play it, though, the less fun I have and the more frustrated I get between grinding seemingly endlessly for credits and failing again and again on seemlingly impossible events, often due to physics issues and glitches.  The Grind The average cost for cutomization options is roughly 150 credits, with some ranging from 30's (mainly goggles) up to 1000 (mainly snow mobiles.) The main method of earning credits is every 5th level, where you will recieve 25 credits. The problem here is both only getting 25 credits every 5 levels, and the leveling frequency diminishes due to increased experience requirements as you level. You quickly end up having to grind for hours just to get 25 credits that isn't enough to actually afford anything on its own. In the 9 hours I have on this game, I have been able to afford a mask and a jacket.  The cheapest snowmobile is ~400 credits. 25 credits goes into 400 16 times and you need 5 levels to get 25 credits. 5 x 16 is 80, meaning you would need to reach level 80 to afford the cheapest snowmobile. Most snowboards and other options, as mentioned, average at about 150 credits meaning you could, at level 80, either buy a snowmobile or ~3 other average price items.  The Bugs I will admit, there aren't a lot of bugs in this game. There are, however, a small few bugs that happen very frequently and are very infuriating. During events you will crash or need to restart and do so very often. Roughly half of the time you restart an event and try to rush past the 3 second count down to get on with the event your character will end up facing the wrong way and in your attempt to get moving you will end up walking or pushing yourself the opposite direction which is especially irritating in time trials. Another big one is, for some odd reason, sometimes when you land in the snow your snowboard/skis will be stuck underneath the snow and cause you to instantly die. This also happens frequently when you try to respawn or join a friend and you end up instantly dead and, in free mode and certain events,  costs you points/exp. I've had times where I crash consecutively up to 5 times before I'm able to keep going.Over half of the events in this game rely on your score, obtained by doing tricks. Scoring high is very difficult when a lot of your score relies on perfect landings that are nearly impossible to land and often don't even register. Half of the time I do a backflip it counts as a frontflip. Tricks don't seem to register an annoying amount of the time and even when you get a high score you'll likely end up losing a lot of it due to glitches and the shoddy physics. The Constant Connection Requirement You have to be connected to the internet to even get to the main menu of this game. This wouldn't be HORRIBLE if you always had a stable connection to the servers. Unfortunately, that's nothing but a dream with SNOW as there are constant connection issues, even while doing singleplayer events. Everytime you restart or finish an event, it needs to check in with the servers which can take up to a couple of minutes sometimes which is even worse when you're constantly restarting events. I've had the game straight up freeze when it tries to connect leaving me to force close it after a few minutes of waiting. The servers are also frequently laggy and crash on occasion. Conclusion SNOW can be fun. It's definitely fun to play with a few friends and explore the large and detailed map as well as share laughs with some of the bugs and bull♥♥♥♥♥♥fun you experience while flying down a mountain at 60 MPH. Unfortunately, that's all that this game really has to offer. Outside of that is a bunch of events that won't be completed by most of you due to the difficulty, infuriating bugs, rampant connection issues,and an insane amount of grinding to be able to afford even the cheapest customization options. I can recommend this game if you want to have a couple hours of fun with friends but as soon as you start trying to take this game seriously and wanting to complete events, challenges, and progress to further your character you quickly start to realize how unfair and annoying this game is to play.

								Wow, just played today. (5/23/15)  Boy they really downgraded the game from what it originally was, terrible physics now and just awful pay wall.  I love how I paid for a game that decided half way through to change to F2P and ruin their system.  This game is failed in every way it can to its supporters.I use to own everything in the shop, it was supposed to be a game you had to buy, now it's just an utter shell of itself and to make matters better they decide to either ditch the last physics system they had or edit it to the point of a terrible arcade-e little♥♥♥♥♥♥of physics.My last investment in a game where I don't have a say in the way it's shaped.

								Bought this game in early alpha and followed through the developement.I am extremely disappointed in the developers.This game had great potential and the idea aswell as parts of the current game are so fun and inspired.The flipside is gigantic tho. The development has basically stood still for over 2 years. Snowboarding was promised to be finished 1.5 years ago. Sales went great. Less and less effort went into the game. Now that Snowboarding is out it is a buggy mess. After 2 Years. The very little time they invested completely went into milking the financial potential. For an unfinished game with almost all core problems unfixed the prices for micropayments are absolutely beyond ridiculous. I payed 13 bucks to support this game. I used to be able to use all cosmetics. For free. Now i would have to pay roughly 3500$ for that. In a completely unfinished Beta game that will 99.999% never be finished. Im so sincerely disappointed in Poppermost for taking this game in the completely wrong direction. You guys seemed like genuine people but I guess I was wrong. Or the good sales ""changed your minds"".Well, whatever you do, do not get this game, do not support these developers. Core elements still dont work, riding and doing tricks feels awkward if anything and not fun in any way. Stay away!			",47,2,3,2,2,1,0

								Great physics, beautiful graphics, and completely open-world. The controls really give you full manueverability of your character and allow you to be in conrtol 100% of the time, even mid-trick. The challenges are fun and give you points to spend at the store where you can customise the look of your character. There is a leveling system which gives you various unlocks as you progress, providing new content to sink your skiis into. Online multiplayer does exist, but with a 12 player limit, good luck getting into one. Highly recommended.Edit: The player count has died down a bit, and the servers are easier to access.

								[Recently announced changes promise to remove my largest issue with SNOW (grinding to unlock spawns). I'll update this review once I've had a chance to try it out. Until then, take this with a pinch of salt]I do recommend this game, but it's a grudging recommendation...The good:* The scenery is stunning* Going off-piste is fantastic* It has bags of potential* Pretty damned good simulation (especially since the latest update, still a few glitches but generally OK)* Excellent music* Great fun to relax and unwind with (I prefer free roam to doing events)* Lots of features being added / improved* Dev team seem committed and I see no signs of vapourware* I haven't personally had any performance issues (although I've seen post from some who have)* Rift support!The bad:* Microtransactions (At least they're currently cosmetic only)* If you want to get to the good spawn points, you have to grind XP* Features keep being removed* Updates are a little slow and there's no target 1.0 date* Controls could do with a tweak (especially moving the camera in 3rd person)* Grinding XP (worth mentioning again, especially when wiping out costs unbanked XP)Perhaps I was spoiled by playing very early versions of this game, but I loved if because it left me alone on a mountain to explore and go where I wanted. Now, however, if you want to try the best bits of the mountain, you need to grind XP which is still insanely slow in Free Roam mode.I may be wrong but I get the impression that once the game is Free2Play, the devs are worried people won't hang around long enough to spend money. Unfortunately, it's turned a fun, relaxing game into yet another slog.I do still recommend it, just. It's beautiful and worth playing, but IMHO it's worse overall than it used to be.

								Ok so .. there has been a recent influx of negetive reviewers. Most of the negetivity is due to either:1. They found out they have to pay real money to customize their skiers looks2. The latest update has a few glitches that need to be ironed out.However, consider that:A. The game will EVENTUALLY be free to play, and they will fund the game on in game purchases. It currently is not because the game is still in early access. You are paying extra money to access the game early .. NOT TO BUY THE GAME. You might think that is stingey, but this is an independantly developed game by a company with LIMITED RESOURCES .. they need your money to make the game!B. Early Access = glitches .. welcome to the world of modern game development.If you can get past those 2 points and have more patience than a 5 year old whiner, then this game is the BEST Skiing game ever made, and IMO the BEST Winter sports game ever made.The major selling point is that the game takes a more grounded ""less arcadey"" approach, while the physics are still a little loose to allow you to pull off some silly jumps, it mostly gets there and it does it well. You can explore a full mountain with little to no restrictions, which includes a resort complete with lifts (which will be rideable eventually) and an entire back country area. There are a plethora of ways down the mountain, and nothing limits you in any direction.This is the Skiing game I have been wishing for since I was 5, and I fully recommend it.

Early Access Review
First off, SNOW is a game that I wish I could mark as ""neutral"". Since Steam doesn't allow that recommendation, I ultimately went with a ""yes"".With a vast glistening landscape and much land to explore, it's hard not to appreciate the beauty that is SNOW. Make your way through the powdery bliss while taking in the various sights and wonderful wilderness. Like the wise Eminem once said, ""lose yourself in the moment"".---------------------------------------------------------GameplayIf you ever had the joy of owning a GameCube, and played SSX Tricky for that matter, then you'll feel relatively at home with this PC translation. If not, then you're still in for a decent treat. While the game has some Early Access issues, ranging from severe graphical glitches to a terribly unforgiving ""death"" system, this game still has its delights that make me recommend it overall.Within this game, you are able to explore a fictitious mountainside named Sialia. There are a number of things that you can do, such as free roaming sessions, and Olympic imitation half pipe performances and ramp jumps. Truly, SNOW offers a fairly realistic winter sports package.Of course, as stated previously, this game has some irritating issues. First off, the punishment for hitting a rock is reasonable. It's death and a restart. Fair enough, yes? Well, then comes the plastic fence. Did you accidently - lightly - graze it? Too bad. Here's your gravestone and a restart. Happen to land on a small twig? Death and a restart. Want to test the fluffiness of that snow bank? Well... yeah, you get the picture. If you're not precise and exact with your movements and control (in other words, a pro), expect to restart this gae a hell of a lot of times.GraphicsSimply put, the graphic in SNOW is absolutely stunning and breathtaking. There is no denying it. Never have I ever been so impressed with a snowboarding/skiing game, and never have I seen one so realistic. The day and night cycle is definitely a huge plus as well, as it further enhances the immersion effect.There is one small gripe that I have, however, and that is the quality of gameplay that you can achieve with a low end PC. My Toshiba E45T is considered one of these said machines, and it makes the game somewhat difficult to play, While I can still enjoy the beauty of the game, the Field of Vision (FOV) is just terrible for me. For example, by the time I see a tree, I've already ""Dittoed"" into a gravestone. This goes for other objects as well, such as the rocks and snowbanks.AudioThe 3 songs that this game has to offer is amazing. The first time I heard them I pretty much fell in love. It really compliments the title. Then I heard them again, and again, and again, and again... the same 3 songs for the next 2 hours that I ended up playing. So while the music is amazing at first, plan on listening to your own playlist... your sanity will thank you later.In regards to the atmospheric sounds, I have no complaints. The wind picking up while your speeding down a slope sounds so authentic, it's amazing. Another plus one to the immersion factor. The scratching of the board on ice is realistic as well. Everything just sounds so perfect, I really can't compliment this aspect enough.---------------------------------------------------------Pros+ Tons of challenges+ This is a great game to play with friends; easy game to get in to if you're already familiar with winter sports+ A lot of things that you can do in this game: ""Fochi 2014"" (play on Sochi 2014), half pipe parks, and free roam+ There aren't a lot of decent snowboarding/skiing games out there, and this one brings me back to my SSX Tricky days+ Honestly, you can't beat the fact that this game is free; does have microtransaction, but it's an amazing product overall+ The graphics are just wonderful - of course it has its issues, but hopefully they're all taken care of by the time this game leaves Early AccessNeutral± There is controller support but it doesn't really feel complete... I could just suck at this game, though... I wouldn't put it past me± If you like electronica music, then the soundtracks in this game will attract you. However, you'll fast become annoyed with them due to there only being 3 so far± It takes some time to connect to the server, but I can't completely blame the game. There are plenty of people who have noted the server issues though, such as losing/dropping connection, but I can say this with 100% truth: I have yet to be kicked from the servers± Decent enough to play on a low end machine, but you will experience some issues. Also, for some reason my friend, who has a better rig than I do, is unable to play this game (it crashes all the time on him). Maybe there is an issue with various graphic cards? Expect some issues in this department (or maybe it's the server issues)Cons- Why am I stuck with a bald headed man?- Weird physics at times: you mean to go one way but end up twirling the other- How do you gain big air? I see it happening in the video, but I can't achieve it in any way whatsoever... please teach me your secrets- I got stuck between a snow bank and a cabin roof. This only happened once, but it was still pretty annoying have to load up the game again- Currently way too easy to die/fail when performing tricks; sometimes you die for absolutely no reason (I remember spawning and dying immediately. What gives?)- While you're able to customise your character, the grind is honestly too real. In the time that I have played this game, I have yet to gain any kind of coin. I'm not really interested in customising my character, however, but I can see where people will have issues with this---------------------------------------------------------Last RemarksMy first impression of this game has been decent. I was not here from the very beginning so I can't compare it to then (supposedly it was even better than it is now). Is that true? I will never know. The best I can offer you is the experience that I had and, while it's probably not popular opinion, it is my own.I'm already biased due to the fact that I never really found a good snowboarding game after my GameCube days. Despite its laundry list of issues, SNOW ended up being the jump back into time that I needed. Furthermore, I really do appreciate all that this free to play game has to offer. From its gorgeous graphics to the size of the map, I personally find it rather difficult to completely dislike this title.Like I said, hopefully the issues can be worked out. This game has been out for a long time now - since October 2013 - so I have hopes for it. If you're into winter sport's, then I'd say SNOW is a decent contender in this overall lacking genre on Steam.Overall5.5/10---------------------------------------------------------Like my review or have any questions? Then please consider joining my review group, the Sonny Report! I will keep it up to date with the games that I plan on reviewing and will also accept suggestions.If you would like to see how SNOW performed on my laptop, you can check out some footage here:

In a medium heatproof bowl, melt 200g of the chocolate over a medium pan of simmering water (don't let the water touch the bottom of the bowl). Remove bowl from heat. Add butter and stir until smooth. Fold in egg yolks. Transfer chocolate mixture to a large mixing bowl.2. In a small bowl, beat egg whites with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Fold cream into chocolate mixture and then egg whites in two batches.3. Divide mousse among serving dishes; refrigerate for 3 hours or overnight.4. To make chocolate curls, melt remaining chocolate and spread evenly over a cold surface such as a flat oven tray, or laminated benchtop. Leave to set almost to room temperature. Drag a melon baller or knife evenly across the surface of the chocolate.5. Serve chocolate mousse with extra whipped cream and chocolate curls.			",32,4,0,0,8,2,0

								This could've been awesome: open world, free to play, finally added snowboards... Sadly it's not. Maybe it's better if you use skis, since that seems like what this was originally designed for, but I'm a snowboarder for real, so I'm not really interested in using skis.So as far as snowboards go, here's my list of complaints:- Controls are okay at best, I do like the button to carve hard and slow down, but otherwise it seems harder to go where        you're trying to than it should be.- Pretty much impossible to mess up jumps unless you land on your head. You can land sideways and not fall, you just lose all your momentum and have to ride extremely slowly for possibly a long time before you reach another sharp descent. I'd rather just fall.- Grinds are ridiculously difficult to do: Angle off by like 2°? Missed the rail. Jumped at the ramp leading to it? Flew right over the whole thing. Didn't jump? Crashed into it instead. - If you do manage to get on a rail, all you can do is boardslide and spin, no nose or tail presses, not even 50-50s.  So not only is it easier to grind rails for real, but I can do a lot more variations. That shouldn't be the case.- Also no manuals.- Really annoying bug where you fall for no reason at the start of a course, and you can get locked into a loop of restart to immediate fall that goes on seemingly forever.- No option for customizing your rider, only clothes and gear. Don't want to be a white, blond, male with a buzzcut? Too bad, that's all you've got to work with.- Pretty sure there's a total of 2 songs on the soundtrack.I really wanted to like this game... I haven't been able to get to a mountain for a couple winters now, and I was really hoping this could at least sorta make me feel better, but all it did was frustrate me and put me in a bad mood.

Graphics: 7/10Okay, the graphics are not super, but they're still pretty good and I think that's good enough for this game, if you zoom on buildings etc... You'll see they're not very detailed, but that's ok.Musics and Sound: 7.5/10They're only a few musics, but they're nice overall, for the sounds, they're all pretty nice except that snow sound which is louder than music and extremely annoyingGameplay: 5/10Well, there's a lot to say about gameplay, first of all, it's nice to have a FREE snowboard/ski game. With all the maps, challenges and events aswell as achievements, the lifetime of SNOW is sure good BUT there are A LOT of bugs, gamebreaking or not, here's a list of bugs I encountered:In the event ""The Devil's Descent"", when you spawn there's stone walls on the left, but they don't have hitboxes so you can go trough them and skip a small part of the descentWith the drone, if you rush in stones while boosting and going up, down etc... You can go trough the stonesThe most horrible bug, sometimes, with NO reason, your player keep crashing when he spawn, again and again, even restarting the game don't change the problem, idk how to correct it...In the event ""S Games Big Air"" my game keeps crashing and I have to log out of Windows or restart my computer.A funny bug, whenever you crash, your character fly meters away, go in the sky while you still hear the skiing sound or do some giant slides.Ok, now for the credits, the only things they can buy that is a feature is the snowmobile which you should be able to get if you keep the credits you win, otherwise you can buy cosmetics for your snowboards/ski, your clothes etc... I think it's a good way for the dev team to make some money aswell as keeping the game totally F2P except for the snowmobileOverall: 6.5/10The game has a great potential, but it has a load of gamebreaking bugs which are never fixed, and it's very probably going to be crushed by Steeps. The game isn't that bad and you can get cosmetics and unlock features if you play enough, the 1st person mode is probably nice in VR.			",97,12,3,3,8,2,6

								As I am not fortunate enough to go skiing every year, I play this game to have some nostalgia.And well, it does a good job. This game is very calming, it runs well and it's free!I would recommend using a controller to play, but it is not 100% necessary.It has it's fair share of glitches but i'm willing to see these through as the developers work on this game.Thanks devs for making me an emotional wreck otherwise.9/10 game.

								Pros and Cons below but keep in mind this is an early access title.Pros:-Great Locations (Only 3 at the moment)-Nice Visuals-Good Amount of tricks.-Solid Mechanics-Steady developer updates-Nice customization optionsCons:-Awkward animations when landing at times (landing when you should fall)-No points or specified tricks when grinding ledges/rails-Some glitches like hats/clothing disappearing and the game freezes at times. (alpha status)-No audio options at the moment, so no muting or changing volume levels. (minor complaint)Overall I really like where this game is headed. I just hope they don't abandon the game before its complete. There is only skiing at the moment but I heard snowboarding will be added so I'm looking forward to that. If you enjoy skiing and/or winter sports this should be a good game for you. I'v played almost 6 hours already and I don't see myself stopping anytime soon. Its a nice change of pace from other games. My gameplay if you're interested>>>>>>>>>>

								(TL;DR) Good gameThroughout my small playtime of SNOW I have greatly enjoyed it, and can see that this game has a lot of potential. The other reviewers seem to be angered by the microtransactions, however, these transactions are only cosmetic for the players character model/skier. So no, there are no BS microtransactions that give another player benefits over others. I'm going to keep this review short and sweet/explainable as possible.PROS: -Beautiful graphics-Decently optimized / Runs GREAT on higher end PCs-Open World-Lots of details and things to look at-Fun Gameplay-Good physics (Sometimes glitch out and act weird)-GREAT atmosphere-Good soundtrack-Navigation is easyCONS: (DunDunDun)-Multiplayer is lacking, while it's there it just seems thrown in at the moment-Wacky Ragdolls (This can be a con because of how hilariously your player model flails about the mountains/slopes.)-Small amount of maps at its current state-Grinding doesn't seem to work wellAll in all, SNOW is a great game at it's core. However, could be improved.Hopefully they add the ability to remove your skiis, and add more activities to do on the mountains. (Snow related.)My final verdict-8/10 at its current state :) ",115,11,9,4,5,0,1

								RATING: 8.7/10 - ExcellentSUMMARYSnow is an excellent skiing game, and is really impressive consideringit being in early stages of development. Recommended for anyone looking fora quality skiing experience on PC.FULL REVIEWSNOW boots you to the main menu where you'll find freestyle skiing, and a store to customize your character. You also find some upcoming features, like Competitive Events. The store is filled with lots of good looking gear, and hopefully much more will come. When you hit Freestyle, you are able to select from a Mountain, the Tutorial, and an olympic themed course. The tutorial I found to be quite confusing, but most of the game is quite simple once you get the basic controls. The mountain is beautifully designed, with great views and jump points. It also has hidden easter eggs like the Yeti and Castle. The olympic course looks pretty good, and can be alot of fun to pull off tricks. Speaking of tricks, air stunts in this game flow well, and there are a great number of them. One problem with this game is sound has yet to be an implemented feature. I'd also like to mention the console's cheat commands, allowing you to slow gravity can be very fun. In conclusion, I recommend this game to anyone looking for a good skiing game on steam.

								SNOW is a fantastic blend of realism, fluid controls, fun and great gameplay. There have been many ski/snowboard games beofre now but all fell short in some ways. For one, many lacked gorgeous graphics and controls were often stiff and/or cumbersome. Secondly, no other ski/snowbaord game that I have encountered has sufficiently embraced free roam as a major part of the game. SNOW is very open and the urge to explore an immense map put before you is alaways prevalent, unlocking new and diverse areas along the way. The two things I see as cons are microtransactions being too preavlent and unstable UI, but these aspects can easily be overlooked with vast custimization options and unique features throughout. I thouroughly enjoy SNOW and will contue to enjoy its relaxing and great gameplay to its fullest extent.			",75,3,0,6,3,0,4

								For an alpha game especially, this game is more fluid than just about any other winter sport sim I have personally played. For the price its worth investing in this gem - the game is worth the money now in alpha, just imagine when it hits release.Right now there are only 3 different ""parks"" or mountains or whatever. Additional maps are inevitable and the ones they have now seem to be very well thought out as far as possible lines and different variaions of ways you can go down the mountain. 10/10 would ski again - and I'm a boarder.Also - I heard whispers of snowboarding being added to this game at some point? Just rumors...? or is this real life,,,,			",126,6,4,9,8,0,5

								SNOW is an upcoming free to play open world skiing game that allows you to ski the mountain down whatever line you wish. You can change the way your character looks and reshape the mountain to your every wish. Scroll to the bottom if you just want to read the general review :) Time for the review:Graphics:This is an early access game, remember that. This game still has amazing graphics and lighting in every aspect. The game graphics are amazing. The low graphics settings ups the performance a lot but still looks very nice, and dont even get me started on how great the ""very high"" setting looks.Controls:The controls are pretty straight forward, just takes a look at the player guide to figure everything out, but becomes very simple after you get the hang of it.Gameplay:The game runs out really smoothly, with glitches here and there, but just remember to keep in mind that this is in PRE-ALPHA state, meaning that the game's core mechanics and gameplay are still in development. The game still has very realistic physics and skiing experience.Performance:SNOW has very good perormance most of the time. The only problem you might have is that when you load a mountain when you are on a different one the game occasionally crashes (at least for me).Sound:Yes, it has been added. a lot of the other reviews are a little outdated. The sound is SO realistic for an early-access game. It sounds just like it would on the mountain.Game Size:This game a healthy amount of varied features that help counter-balance the glitches in this gameMultiplayer:SNOW has a multiplayer feature but you usually end up in lobbies with little to no people inside. Once the game goes F2P then it will likely get a lot better. This is at least how it ends up for me, but maybe not for others.Mountain design:SNOW's mountains are very well made and have lots of ridable features. The features in the Lo2 park have full jumping/grinding capability, and the backcountry, like the observatory or summit have many obstacles such as boulders and rocks.OVERALL:I recommend this game to any gamers who love to play freestyle sports video games, open world games, or just love playing glitchy games for the fun of it(they'll get fixed soon, please dont fix the funny ones :3). If you don't like games that are very glitchy then i would wait until the game reaches beta. Same goes for people who dont want to pay for the game. I had a really fun time playing this and it probably wont go out of early access for a while anyways, so...................................... 9.5/10 would review again :3			",281,38,18,21,28,0,14

								Moje česká preview: http://www.playhit.cz/2014/12/snow-nejrealistictejsi-simulator-lyzovani/First of all, I'm gonna say that I recommend the purchase of the Early access only to the biggest fans and those who are willing to support a project in its beginning, a project, that is not a full game yet.SNOW looks awesome! You gotta love every detail in this game's graphics. The panorama is actually so beautiful that it makes you loose your focus on riding itself! But then comes the downer side, riding feels great and all, very realistic, until you hit a rail or fall down and glitch your body half way through to the Matrix. I think there should be a button for sliding like in Tony Hawk for example, otherwise the rider looks just plain bored, standing all straight and stuff. Or, there actually is a button for this but I didn't find it because there is no way to check out or adjust the controls! That is kinda unacceptable, but I do understand this is a pre-alpha and I'm not gonna judge it so harshly until the whole thing's out. I can't wait to review this later when they put snowboards in it. I am a passionate SNB rider myself and it would be great to performe some tricks on PC that I'm scared to try IRL.I'll edit this when it's out.			",90,27,5,17,9,3,6

Originally posted by Moonie:I'm not really going to rate this game on microtransactions as I always ignore the microtransactions part.Honestly, I used to be able to run this game and I thought it was actually really fun.With the new engine update, it's really ruined it for me. Runs absolutely terribly and they ruined the entire gameplay because now you have to unlock the areas, after playing it for roughly 1 hour or less trying to find out how to unlock the areas, I just couldn't. I don't know how.Through out the playthrough I've found waaay too many bugs (Understandable for a EA game) with both gameplay and controls. With the 360 (And XBone) Controller, it would either not work half way through the game (And I'd have to restart) or it would just crash the minute I used my controller. Keyboard and Mouse controls were fairly decent, didn't notice much of a problem other than a imput delay but it was ""Alright"".Here's my opinion about microtransactions, there should be a way to earn credits instead of having to buy these credits.This would really dim down the whole micro-transaction part, or maybe add a way to earn these clothings that you can buy with these creditsMy overall rating without my microtransactions review: 3/10My overall rating with my microtransactions review: 2/10When new updates are released, I'll change my review depending on the updates.The updates have rolled in and I just installed the game after not playing it for... a couple months maybe?Let's ignore microtransactions completely, because the game it's self is actually pretty fun (now atleast), I'm still using the same build since I wrote the quoted review and the performance is flawless on the max settings. (Average of 120 - 200 FPS, frames do drop below 100 for me when I'm in forest-like areas.) Now, about the whole speed loss n' such after the engine change, yeah, I'm noticing that's kinda gone, but after the latest updates, it looks like they brought it back.I'm actually in love with this, mainly the multiplayer though, it's so damn fun playing with your friends in this game, honestly. I'd say pick up this game for you and a friend it you wanted to have fun, playing solo is still fun but sorta bland.The ragdoll physics are abit wonky but are actually pretty funny, assuming that's not intentional, I hope it stays like this, I love it. Skiing physics in general, I'd say they're solid, a few ""Hard to control"" things here and there, but overall works fine.Now, I'll get onto the bad of this game. The UI really needs some tweeking and reworking, in it's current state, it works with SOME flaws, the UI in general is somewhat barely useable by mouse, but fine with keyboard and controller, hoping that this is not meant to be played with just a controller (Despite me using a controller mainly). The arrows to select between settings is rather annoying to click on the mouse, but perfectly fine for a controller.Switching settings is tedious as hell, I was trying to change my graphics settings and the screen the game was on, but the settings would either 1) change to what it was on before, 2) go back to defaults or 3) just go to some random setting I didn't select. YET AGAIN, this is another mouse & keyboard problem for me, using the controller for the settings, then applying them and they're set to what I chose, which is making me feel this game is very... ""Controller-required"" if that makes sense, mainly for the UI.As much as I said ""Let's ignore microtransactions"", I want to bring it up just this once;Yeah, sure there's microtransactions, but that doesn't mean dislike the game, all the items are cosmetic, they do not provide and sort of ""Boost"" of some kind, not saying I'll give them money for this type of system. But looking at the leveling system, it seems they give you items AKA unlocking parts of the map and the cosmetics, which I really like about a game filled with microtransactions. I will point out that you can unlock other areas of the map by skiing around or in them, which is a huge plus for unlocking areas. But this also means you are limited to certain areas for some time, getting around isn't entirely that hard though.My overall rating without my microtransactions review: 7.5/10My overall rating with my microtransactions review: 7.5/10			",198,38,7,12,22,4,9

								I've been playing this game since very early on in the Early Access process, and am very eagerly anticipating the 1.0 release. I've been waiting for a good skiing/snowboarding game for PC for YEARS, and this is looking very much like it will be that game. Absolutely beautiful environments! Controls and physics are still definitely beta, but that's what the play testing cycle is for.Highly recommend!			",51,19,2,10,9,1,9

								Recommended for Windows. NOT recommended for Linux/SteamOS (as of 15/04/2016). Crashes, resolution issues, general unhappiness. Streaming from Windows to SteamOS is fine though.Pros:+ Doesn't appear to be pay-to-win (yet)+ Snowboarding and Snowmobile patches coming soon+ Fun to play, relaxing music (limited songs though)+ Leveling, steam achievements, steam cloud+ Keyboard and controller (xbox 360 tested) both work well, though controller preferredCons:- Ragdoll physics are funny to watch but are competely bonkers- No ragdoll in multiplayer (insta-tombstone)- Limited music- No local co-op/multiplayer on the same PC (this would be great feature imho)- Fear of a pay-to-win, pay-to-play model in the future. I'd love the devs to state something regarding this			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Another STEAM special.  Ask people to pay full price (I DID WHEN IT CAME OUT OUT ALMOST 2 YRS AGO) for an alpha/beta version...then NEVER finish completing the game.  This game HAD so much potential.  It has never been completed and likely never will.  You guys were on the right track....and then just bailed on the customers who paid.  CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT against STEAM and this developer is needed.  It's been almost 2 years and no finished game.  DO NOT BUY - EVER.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Snow is a skiing (and later snowboarding) simulation game.I love the game soo much because of the thrill and immerssion you get from a game. It really feels like you are on a mountain with the sound of the snow and wind whipping around while you, race down a mountain at deadly speeds.The main mountain is very well crafted (except for a few ways out of the map) and is clearly shown that a lot of work was put into the landscape. The game is really beautiful with a dam, town, forest and much more.This game clearly had effort put into it and is well worth the cheap price.10/10           ps. keep up the good work, developers.

Early Access Review
								Oh boy, the developement process... In the early stages, without any store or really anything to do except for exploring, this game was a lot of fun already and my hopes for a halfway decent skiing/snowboarding game rised. Then came the infamous ""cash shop"" update, that also changed the existing physics to something horrendous. The controls got slippery and manouvering in the game world got tedious. And, ofcourse, the prices. Coins were way to expensive for the amount of goodies you were able to get. Right now you get 1000 coins for 10$. A full set of new equipment will net you around 1,2-1,5k. That makes 15$. Don't get me wrong, that's a lot of cash for some digital clothes. Especially for an early acces game that might never be finished... On the other hand, other developers sell cosmetic goodies for up to 30$ (you know who i'm looking at here...) and people buy it. So i think supporting the only company that seems to have atleast some interest in a skiing- and later on snowboarding game, no matter how long the developement will go on, is a good thing.And let's be honest... The game, at its core, is enjoyable and fun to play. On top of that, there is some way to earn coins through playing, thought I don't know how that works exactly....			",117,12,7,13,11,1,7

								There are lots of bugs. As in like all of them. sometimes you just randomly crash(only happened once to me though), sometimes you dont crash when you should, use never worked for me, and while it's not a bug, it was almost impossible to see the runs diffrent from the snow on the side. With all of that said though, it's still fun. I find myself fixated on doing soem very specific weird stuff, and it's fun to try to complete those goals. The controls aren't great, but if you switch it from being a snow sport simulator to just being a weird fun game, it works. It's very early acsess, but it's still fun. Good concept, and I can't wait to see it improve.			",77,18,0,13,9,0,5

								The best winter sports sim to date!      Playing SNOW in it's Alpha form, though buggy in certain situations, lays the groundwork for a highly addicting, realstic, ski simulation game.      Each update is highly anticipated.        The latest, M4, changed many of the rotation dynamics so that they are presented more realistically.  The features in the  new L02 park are fixed to work most of the time.  Grinding and jumping from rail to rail looks incredibly smooth.  Spinning off of rails and boxes is a lot of fun.  The big airs aren't super massive to where it's unbelievable anymore, but the realistic approach works so well for this type of game.      The rest of the mountain has improved much, although, I wish there was still a castle.  Maybe there is?  Maybe I haven't found it yet?   Another great feature of this game:  replayability.  I have spent hours taking alternative routes and  hitting yet another crazy line.  The mountain is huge and every nook and cranny is worth exploring.       Overall, I believe this game is an incredible purchase $15.  With the fact that it will also be coming out for PS4, this game will make drastic improvements and additions within the next year (maybe months if we are lucky) including multiplayer, more mountains, new items, and snowboarding.  The ultimate ski sim.  I would recommend this game to anyone who is likes realstic sims or skiing/snowboarding. ",110,3,2,3,1,0,1

								From what I've experienced with this game people either love it or hate it.Personally, I really enjoyed this game for these reasons:- PC gamers havent had a free roam multiplayer snowboarding game ever. It's an awesome experience riding with friends.- The game isn't impossible hard, but at the same time it can be difficult to perform extremely well.- Riding with all my friends creates an experience similiar to snowbaording/skiing with friends in real life.- The game has a lot of potential to be something new- The bugs currently in the game make for a hilarious experience. They arent game breaking.A couple of things I'd like to see:- Private Servers for friends- Expanded character customization- A social menuIn conclusion, 8/10.... Too much snow			",175,13,10,17,12,2,23

								Hello Mr. ""IneedtohearsomeExpierence""!Visuals:If u want to see a beautiful Winter-Mountain-Landscape and exploring these, you will need a good graficcard. Not like me nvidea 600 series :S because the time of that series is really over, but its possible to play if u have other good stuff in your PC, like me 1st series of i7.Enough about the PC, the person model it self is a little bit stiff, but otherwise it would eat more ressources, so i take that because the scape is more important!Gameplay:Awesome, first you will feel back in SSX with the keysettings on controller (if you played), but with improvements, because you can decide where you Grap your Ski's (ski only, Snowboard & Snowmobile will income). Playing with Keyboard feels rediciulous, but also possible and i used it enough to say that's ok (since yesterday 30.03.16) you are also able to make new keybindings :DGaming Modes you have are: Soloplay (with Awesome Features), Multiplayer (for the fun and showtime with friends).In the Soloplay you have Events to get first cosmetic stuff, challenges (witch i could play till yet) but its like a check list of tricks u have to do and of cause u have the freeroom where u can check out the whole mountain. The Multiplayer has No Drone, No own Respawn Point, but its for cruising with friends.So for your decision, if you like to explore Mountain's in Winter and do some Tricks, take that Simulator, because it looks like u driveing a skiing pro, never saw some compareable, exceptable is SSX for Playstation, but the difference between those two are the focuse of the Gamedeveloper, Snow is more the Simulator witch is Focused ""Ride the mountain on your Own"" and make it beautiful with nice Jumps. And on other Hand SSX is just more like Tony Hawk, Arcade highscoring.For over 10 Years i was Every Year in Austria, Skiing / Snowboarding and for me its an Awesome game for relaxing but at the same discover new areas and try Awesome Jumps from rediculous Drops.Thank you for reading my first ReviewPlz give me some Feedback,critics also welcome :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Disclaimer - I have been gifted a free key for this game for review purposes, however my review will be kept as truthful as possible, since I am meant to help developers and buyers/gamers.  SNOW Review:  (Not so) Quick summary It's one of the top of the genre, if not, the top of the Snow games genre. Excellent graphics, lots of maps which are very large, especially the Mountain which has more than 10 spawn points all in different areas, with each one having so much to explore than the others. You can be a pumkin head with epic shoes doing a backflip just to land it perfectly and - just in time - take a screenshot. The optimization might not be the best, so I just put it onto medium-ish settings. And I'm telling you that if I can run Titanfall on medium, I should be able to run this on high! Wait... look at that snow, all these textures! It's so good looking! Nevermind then, if you take a closer look SNOW is very strong in the category of Graphics.  Graphics It's a beautiful game, very impressive for a game which costs this little. You might say to yourself ""Heh, that's nothing. Have you Seen GTA V?"" and to that I said that I have seen it and played both games, SNOW and GTA V. GTA V is a costly game which is a finished release with some updates. SNOW is a cheaper game in earlier developement with way more snow. It's just very nice to see that you can change time ingame. I love to set it to sunrise. All those pinkish colors on the snow, those brighter shadows. It looks almost like a film or as if I'm an actual Skieer with a camera strapped to a flying bot following me. An easy 9/10. Sounds The sounds remind me of the Skate series. Skate is about skating, SNOW is about skiing. Both have magnificent sounds about their genres. The snow sounds realistic as if I'm cutting it up, which I sort of am in the game. The music is excellent, just, one of the best soundtracks, Burnout Paradise in front of SNOW by only a few points. The sounds are very high quality. A simple 8/10 for sounds. Payment You can pay for cosmetic items. since I have recieved the Starter Edition from the kind developers, I do not know if you start with any ingame credits.  Anyway, there's definitely quite a bit over 100 items in total that you can purchase. The average itme is around 50-70 credits. Some items cost a bit more (up to 200 from what I have seen). So you could buy a lot, trust me on this. I got an epic Pumkin Hat for very cheap. It looks awesome. You can get more credits by using real-life money. Pros vs Cons Pros:Excellent graphicsCheap for such a good gameItem pricing is low enough to buy a ton for littleUpdates are not too rareSounds are very impressiveCons:Not the best optimization  I have been gifted the key by the kind developers of the game.

Early Access Review
								This is one of the only games I've ever played where switching control schemes has improved it so drastically that I've gone back and altered my previous review.Long story short: Play this game with a gamepad. Analog sticks are absolutely essential, the M/K controls are complete sewage, but you could probably guess that.Apart from that, the game is a really fun, fast-paced, and generally intuitive skiing sim. Combos require enough skill in timing to be genuinely satisfying to pull off, the maps are absolutely gorgeous (CryEngine ain't no slouch in the visual department) and there are very few other games that so accurately recreate the feeling of flying through a forest at breakneck pace. It makes the moments of triumph all the more fun to achieve when they're punctuated by your character inevitably crashing into a tree and his ragdoll shooting into space.On that note, the game can get frustrating at times. The camera is angled slightly downward by default, and the way the maps are laid out makes it very difficult to actually see past bigger inclines. That means that if you're going for the biggest jumps (and why would you not be?) you're taking massive leaps of faith every time, and it's almost impossible to predict whether your angle is going to send you into a fluffy patch of snow for a perfect landing or into a rock so your character can make another trip into space. Meanwhile, the combo system gives out points for tricks and penalizes mistakes, but the amount it penalizes doesn't seem to have any correlation to the severity of the mistake you made. At one junction, I had just pulled off a cork 1440, earning 80 points in the process, and had landed right next to a row of trees, so I had to do a little weaving to avoid a crash. I didn't quite get out of the way of a slight incline in the ground, though, and my character tripped up on it, so I rewinded about 20 feet to turn a little harder left and avoid it, for which the game penalized me 120 points. So my net profit for one of the biggest jumps and longest combos I pulled off in the game was -40 points. I don't know how it calculates those penalties, but that formula needs an overhaul before this game finishes its Early Access run.Tokens are ridiculously hard to earn without microtransactions, but that much was predictable just from the fact that the game has microtransactions at all. Of course they're difficult to earn without paying, that's the whole point. But what bewilders me about the microtransactions is that the only things currently available in the store are a paltry handful of challenges and cosmetic bonuses, neither of which really seem enticing when the game already comes with six maps and a bunch of unlockables. Mind you, only one of the maps that comes with the base game (Sialia) is actually an open world for exploration and the rest are just challenge runs with one or two jumps in their entirety. It's not like I expected Skyrim for the asking price, but when the game sells itself as an open-world skiing experience I would like a change of scenery every now and again. I was never a fan of jump events even back when I was on a ski team in real life, and exploring giant mountains at high speed has always been my favorite part of the sport. It's not a deal-breaker, because Sialia is a pretty good map with a lot of places to explore, but I'd definitely like the game more if it had more open areas like that. Moreover, it wouldn't make the store itself feel completely vestigial.So in short, it's a little bit buggy and a little bit of a cash grab, but I can't really begrudge it because the core experience is still rock-solid as far as skiing games go. Definitely feels like an Early Access title, but it's at least got me interested enough to hold out until the full release. Make of that what you will.			",95,15,1,5,11,0,5

Early Access Review
								OK so first off, i just bought this game and i have seen a few videos on it so i was pretty excited. (NOTE: I am writing this review fully knowing that this is an early access game. these are just things that I hope get fixed)First off, the video settings and all settings in general are almost impossible to change and it takes a long time to change it from ""windowed"" to ""full-screen"". That really annoyed me. Then when i tried to play it (my PC is ""supposed to be able to handle it"" according to the requirements) but the loading screen was so long it reminded me of Skyrim. Then the map didn't even load and it started changing my COMPUTER'S screen zooming in everything. I tried closing the game, but it wouldn't close. Even when i tried to crash-close it with the task manager on my computer. So after the 10 dollars I spent and the hour I waited downloading this gave me 7 minutes in hell. This game looks really good even though i am not able to play it with the ""recommended"" computer specs. I am really sad that I wasn't able to play it and i will keep trying to get it to run.One thing. I do NOT want the came changing anything on my computer and messing with the screen and my other windows and stuff because its really annoying and i have to fix it all. and it also needs to have settings that are easier to change. That is all---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------NEW REVIEW!This game has improved so much! It is less intensive on your computer, has more places to go and things to do and is just more fun than it was a while ago! Now it is one of my favorites. Definitley worth the 10 dollars it used to be!			",44,4,0,5,11,0,0

								One could argue it's pointless writing a review for a game that is literally half-finished, but I like to think of Early Access reviews as reviews based on potential. And the potential for SNOW is immense.While most winter sports games are about racing or chaining together ludicrous jumps, SNOW is a more level-headed approach focused on the actual riding. Not that it doesn't feature its own share of ridiculousness: Surviving a drop from 30 meters with both your legs intact is just another day at the office. And due to the game's open approach, it's up to the player whether he does alpine skiing or just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥around at the half-pipe.Despite the game being in a very early stage, it already captures the sense of freedom and speed more than adequately. It's a blast just shooting downhill and dodging obstacles or finding new routes during freeriding, all while relaxing electronica is playing in the background. SNOW treats winter sports with respect and transports much of the fascination to the player.It's needless to say that there's not much content at the moment and the little there is still requires a lot of work. Right now, a purchase would be less about your own pleasure and more about supporting the devs. With that being said, the core of SNOW is rock-solid, which is why I believe the game deserves support. Even in its current state, SNOW offers a glimpse of greatness and I wish the team the best of luck for this project.			",261,44,4,15,7,0,28

Early Access Review
								A complete mess!""Snow""If you call your name ""snow"", then what should be one of the main points of the game? Creating the feeling of actually moving on and through snow! Remember Lost Planet 1? You actually moved through snow, got stuck in it, sink in it.Unfortunately, the snow in this game feels like white concrete, there are almost no particle effects, and no effect of your skier or snowboards to actually sink in the snow. They are just clipping through the ground.""Physics"" and ragdollThe physics in this game are a complete mess! Jumps don't feel realistic, the momentum feels random (sometimes you're fast, sometimes not). Even worse then that is the fact, that the ragdoll will trigger almost instantly, when you don't land perfectly on spot! I am aware, that they don't want to be arcade with this one, but this is just frustrating, and nothing more! GraphicsI already mentioned, that the snow does not look like snow at all. But actually just the whole graphical environment looks absolutely bad! All textures look blurry, the effects are cheap. Overall it looks like a game from the launch era of the Xbox360.ConclusionI get, that this is an Early Access titel, but holy moly. This game is an outdated, random mess, that even fails to deliver its most basic core: simulating snow!It is free to play, so you may have nothing to lose but your free time. But even that is something you might want to consider.			",255,52,4,27,22,0,27

Early Access Review
								The premise of SNOW is excellent - a beautiful, open world, winter sports with multiplayer support and multiple huge mountain ranges to explore. Unfortunately, Poppermost Productions does not seem to be a company that's able to pull this feat off.SNOW, before the most recent update (~01/04/2016) was an unpleasant but playable game. The currently only option to go is skiing - which was fairly enjoyable (albeit fairly repetitive) on the game's large mountain range. You can respawn in a manner of unlockable locations or on other players on the server which works most of the time (but can be frustrating when someone respawns on you and you lose your bearings :/)After this update, the playability has gone and now it's a buggy mess. If you can make it into a multiplayer game without crashing and needing to restart your PC, you're faced with countless bugs - from falling through the world to being completely overwhelmed by truly horrific hit detection and scoring.The game is unbelievebly unstable - both in the menus that overlap and cause the game to crash and the game's reluctancy to safely Alt+Tab in and out of the game. This can kind of be explained by its 'Early Access' disclaimer, but the game has been out since 2013. SNOW feels like a severely unfinished 'My First Game' that has overrun on its budget both on time and money - as, of course, there's a fully functional store where you can buy in-game licensed products such as skis, gloves, and jackets.TL;DR: SNOW could be a great game, but its seemingly random untested patches, poorly written features and quick gameplay burnout cycle are a fatal concoction that's destined to fail.

Early Access Review
								There's a real gem of a game in here but it doesn't want to give up its pleasures without a bit of a fight! I've been desperate for a good snowboarding game since Amped 2 (although Amped 3 was great fun too - just not as rewarding) and I was toying with the idea of Steep or Infinite Air. Unfortunately, Steep just looks like a racing game in an open snowy world (it doesn't even have grinding FFS!) and Inifinite Air gets pretty bad reviews and the demo is shockingly poor as a sales pitch (the producer who let THAT demo out of the door should be fired!).Initially I thought Snow was just too buggy and unpolished but as you invest time in it it really starts to shine. No magic trick combo buttons like SSX, no super-magnetic grinds or impossibly high jumps and a finesse on the controls that takes patience to get to grips with. But as you progress, it all starts to flow and feels really good... and the more time you put in, the more rewarding it gets. After 3 hours I've barely scratched the surface but I've done enough to make me want to forgive the bugs and get better at it. No urge to buy IA or Steep anymore and... its FREE!!Definitely worth trying and definitely worth putting at least an hour into it before you give up. The graphics are pretty decent, the events are good and the game is getting better with each update and as a bonus, if you have a Rift it looks brilliant... although the UI in VR is hard to see and it's even more buggy there - oh and if you try and start it in NON VR with the Rift connected... it'll start in VR anyway but won't work properly. Minor details though - the bottom line is.....This is a great feeling snowboarding and skiing game with HUGE potential that just needs more time and polish. Definitely recommended - what have  you got to lose??			",26,8,2,3,8,0,2

								I've been here from the start, I bought into early access and I had high hopes... I've seen it all change for better or worse. The developers are amazing and ambitious but my problem is it's always been average the game isn't amazing but neither is it terrible.The good well the settings are all there screen options, a tonne of advanced graphics settings... all the good stuff! The music is by far my favourite thing in the game there's only a few tracks but those few tracks are so calming and beautiful. You can deck out your character as much as you would like the options are all there clothing wise anyways and with the new addition of snowboarders there's even more! I can say for a small dev team the content updates come out quite frequently which is never a bad thing. Maps are nice and big and online play works for the most part!Now the bad the game is a buggy mess for the most part constant crashes, the physics seem off to me and the wait for snowboards was far to long to warrant how average the gameplay is, what I'm trying to say is I don't think it's fun... it's actually quite boring after the first 2-10mins. As a founder I expected more than what I got, I get it microtransactions is all fine and dandy since it's free now but what about when I paid to support you? A few clothes is all I'm worth... that's great! Aside from free roaming there is nothing else to do the game is tedious, slow and most of all not fun.Look it's fine as a free to play game, I'm trying not to bash it because I wanted to love it and I know plently of people like this game and that's fine but what I expected was Skate in the form of snowboarding/skiing but what I got was a  bland free roaming buggy mess. I've been patient for 3 years and now I finally know were this is headed, I hope all the best to the devs but this game isn't what I'm after... maybe someday in the future but now it's a strong no!

There are obviosuly some imperfect parts as this game is in early access but as an avid snowboarder I am more than happy to support these devs who seem to really care about the project.

								AWESOME simply awesome. Still in development but has massive potential for multiplayer and multi winter sport event modes. Fluidity, physics and textures as well as playability has been well thought through and designed to acuratley mimic fp or 3rd person skiing experience. Hopefully will also be adaptable to occulus rift down the track. Packed full of adictive features including a great musical score, wide variety of character options, points scoring system for trick based moves (like ssx ps3) snow is a must have not only for winter sports lovers but really for anyone just wanting something a bit different, replayable and adrenaline pumping fun.

								This game may be free, but it just isn't fun. The controls are clunky and unintuitive. The graphics are very basic and there is a lot of weird janky stuff that happens. I mean your snowboard/skis are NON STOP clipping with the ""snow"" on the ground. The physics are terrible. Most the time you just feel like you're going really really slow. If you're barreling down the face of a mountain and you carve or spin around you most certainly do not lose all your momentum. Which brings me to my ultimate point - the game does not FEEL good. It doesn't feel like an authentic representation of what snowboarding/skiing is. I can go back and play SSX 3, a game that came out 13 years ago on the PS2, and it feels better than this game. It's more fun than this game. This game just didn't live up to my expectations. Here's hoping that STEEP can scratch the itch when it comes it.			",179,30,2,29,5,1,18

								This game has been nearly 3 years in the making in early access and it seems the only thing they have actively worked on is the implementation of the store and cosmetic items. The game was more playable when it first launched into early access. Controls seem worse then before, interface is just horrible and riddled with bugs, you cant equip the items you own because the interface wont register that you clicked on certain items so your character is stuck wearing default set. They claim this is a free to play open world game but there is little to no interaction with other people. I havnt even seen an option as to how to go about getting into another game with people. 3 years and this game still isnt functional. Its too obvious that the devs decided to cash out by focusing on market items only and letting the game rot. Another company added to the very long list of how game devs are taking advantage of the market. Let this game die, wait for ""Steep"" if youre really wanting a good open world snow game. Its pathetic that games like Cool Boarders and SSX or even Shaun White are the best snow games made to date. Those games outdated mechanics and graphics are better then this heap. Save your time and money cause this game will never be fully released.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Finally i've received the key for early access, i've waited 3 months for received the key.I've played this game for an hour, but long enough to know some good and bad points.First good Great menu (someone will say it's not a great menu. but for me it's)Huge open world for see (or you can choose for a closed circuit), with the soundtrack it's great, complements the overall the gameplay.If you choose for a closed circuit, carefully at the end of the circuit you can get stuck but that can be solved pressing the ""R"" (using that you get penalized with some down points). You can buy some cosmetic but it's only visual (Please still on visual and not P2W).It's good see a winter sport on pc, well doneThe bad (Negative) The jumping mechanics are a bit badly (or a lot) and your jump height is a little low (depends of the circuit you choose if you jump with carefully you can make a Backflip with successful)Controls need to be reworkedGround controls it's good but not at all ( I mean more speed for a big jump, more tricks, points)Air controls i'm not agree with (arrow keys) make the same move except they change the direction of the move you do.The female character, has been forgotten for now on the gameIf you don't wanna pay for test the game, wait until its release ( Will be free )PS: Sorry if i've got an bad english i'm trying to do the best.

								Fun freeskiing game that keeps getting better and better. If you like skiing games, you'll probably like this.Some people seem to have bought this under the impression that it wouldn't at some point become free-to-play (even though it's clearly stated in the Early Access information), so if you think you might be one of those people, definitely don't buy this game, but instead read the Early Access information box again and again until you feel you understand what it says.Also, if you have some awesome alternative monetization plan in mind for Poppermost to use after releasing the game as F2P to use instead of microtransactions for completely cosmetic things, definitely contact them about it instead of leaving a negative review, I'm sure they'd love to hear about it.

								TL;DR at the bottomSNOW is one of those games that you just got to love, exploring the mountain with friends and finding amazing places to ski down and doing trix or make up an Impromptu race on your own.Being an open world game penefits the game alot, the problem with alot of skiing games is that you start at the top and when you are down at the bottom of the hill, you have to start a new session or restart at the top.Here you can just go and return to the top whenever you want.Yes the game got a lot of glitches and some things like the spawning must be corrected, as it is now some random player can spawn on you and accidentally kill you. I would love to see a ""only allow friends to spawn on me"", And when they do spawn they should spawn a few feets behind and not directly on top of you. The game is still in Early Access so hopefully they will correct all the problems.TL;DR:Like Skate3 but on skis.			",94,3,16,8,10,1,8

								*UPDATE 17/02/15* SNOW is finally set to go into 'Closed Beta' soon - which is wicked; look back through the updates and you'll see that I was a bit worried that this game would fall on to the ever-increasing 'Died in Early Access' pile - progress is being made. With every minor update my FPS increases by 10-15, the UI (whilst still buggy) is now 'functional', and the graphical tweaks here and there have really made a difference - this game does genuinely look 'good', not spectacular, but a decent 'good' rating. The controls keep on being tweaked too; I can now compitently get down the Sialia course without having to respawn a billion times and even throw in some 'gnarly' tricks here and there. :DThat being said, the game still lacks motive. What am I supposed to be doing? You get to the bottom of each course and nothing happens. No leaderboard announcement, no objectives to meet - gravity pulls you to the bottom of the course... and that's pretty much it. There is an arbitary score counter, but it doesn't mean anything.I want the 'Closed Beta' to be big. I want a lot of people to come and play this game because it has impressed me, it's come a long way, and it deserves a bit of recognition. There's nothing else like this game on Steam. I REALLY WANT TO RECOMMEND THIS GAME, POPPERMOST; I HONESTLY, HONESTLY DO.....but I can't - £10.99 for this game is crazy. I picked it up two years ago when it was in early Alpha for about £3 (because why not?) £10.99 for Early Access to an F2P game is insane, especially when all you get is some exclusive clothes. If people are playing this game because all they want to do is play 'dress up' with a wireframe, then good for them, but it's getting to the stage where I'd like to see more in the form of 'an actual game' from SNOW and I hope the Beta will show me this.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*UPDATE 25/09/14* The 'M4' patch for this game makes it playable (lol). It's still got a long way to go, mind you. The big addition in this patch is 'sound'. Fitting drum & bass beats over the crisp sloshing and scraping of snow; it's damn good, actually. The new map they added is completely unoptimised, so I got a steady FPS of 4 out of it, but this is an alpha, so it's to be expected.The no. 1 addition for me in this patch is that it proves that there is progression in this game. I'm not readly to 'recommend' it just yet - it is still alpha, but I am hopefull for the next patch. Let's just hope it doesn't take another 10 months.*UPDATE 14/09/14* This game is still completely unplayable. The commands work half of the time, the procedually generated map is not 'procedually generated'; it's just completely random. There is still no sound in it (as in, the game is completely silent - even the UI), and the UI is buggy as hell.*ORIGINAL REVIEW*'Currently in development' is a complete understatement. This game is the reason why the 'Early Access' scheme should have some kind've assurance that the game is even playable.This game is not playable.Come back in a year's time, don't waste your money.

At 1300km/h we activated the main thrusters on our skis, sending us down at speeds faster than any vehicle ever created by man. We both risked snapping our necks clean off by turning to each other and giving a thumbs up. This is what we lived for. Pure speed. Adrenaline. Dancing with death, looking it right in the eye and proclaiming ""Not today, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! I do the work. I earn the money. I am the one that decides when to have sex. I have the ultimate power, economically AND physically and I will not doubt for a second to use my full adult male force to put you into back in your place. These strong ♥♥♥♥ing arms have killed before, and if pushed I will not hold back. Spouse or not."".As me and Adam were approaching mach 2 down the mountain, Adam proclaimed he had trouble with his thrusters. I could sense the fear in his voice. Something was wrong. Out of nowhere, his right skis thrusters shot off with full force, ripping his entire right leg off together with the ski. The scream over the radio headset was ear shattering. I tried to focus on staying on track and avoiding crashing into a tree, which would be an instantaneous death, but I had to look. The sight sent a chill down my spine. My best friend was doing his best to hold his form at 2100 km/h with only one leg. I could see in his visor a single tear rolling down his cheek. He turned his head to me, and raised his right arm in a salute, risking his hand getting torn off from the wind pressure. The time had come. I nodded.Adam veered off-track, right into a big pine tree. The red mist of my best friend will be forever imprinted in my memory. The following explosion set off a massive avalanche, the biggest since 2004. The avalanche posed no threat to me due to the sheer speed I was traveling, but the same can not be said for the neighboring ski town of Obersaxen, which was struck by the avalanche and completely submerged by snow. 640 people died. Thankfully our families were not in Obersaxen but in a town 20 or so miles away where I told Adams wife what happened.Sadly Adam wasn't a winner. A winner wouldn't let his best friend ♥♥♥♥ his wife, but Adam did. Adam did the very moment he became meat smoke. Some people were just born weak.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Terrible now.  It is now unplayable for me.Just tried this for the first time in months on 5/30/2015 because ski season is now over for me.I have a Radeon R9 290 Tri-X OC and I am now getting crazy screen tearing and graphical issues - there is constantly text flashing in the bottom right.  I tried adjusting in game graphics down but that did not prevent tearing.  Vsync is not working properly it seems.  I tried lowering graphics to an embarrassingly low quality and it still was tearing and having graphical problems (FYI I can play GTA V on very high graphic settings with no problems).  I am going to uninstall for now.From reading other's experiences I guess they also added in a bunch of stupid micro-transactions...THIS GAME WAS SO FUN LAST SUMMER, DON'T KILL IT!			",33,0,0,2,6,0,5

Hold fast to dreams, for when dreams come to life, its a barren field Frozen with SNOW.I had my doubts about this game, but upon receiving the invitation to participate in the beta, i was so thrilled that i didn´t think twice on apply, but the constant update makes this game an horrible experience.The controls are bit of a pain in Justin Biebers buttchecks, i felt like a iwas playing ragdoll simulator.You´ll find yourself falling on every trick attemp for its bad control, that is if you dont glitch.The animation needs work, well, everything needs work, but this game as potential.I feel this is not just for me but many others in here when i say, its better to wait for the finished product before attempting to play another match in SNOW.Giving it a thumbs up because i see potential here, its a very good game but, it just failed to amaze me......for now!

Its also fun to go on multiplayer which isnt the best designed but it works, and just race your friends down the many mountains! Although i wish there were more large maps, The game is awesome and it would take a loong time to discover every slope, and every ski lift!

								since the supreme snowboarding (the greatest snowboard game in means of ... anything - even the soundtrack was dope in that time) and lesser known ""virtual breckenridge"" i was in constant look for playin something that includes snow and snowboards. when i first purchased snow (yes, i paid for that on steam and missed the date i was able to have the money-back) it could not even start on my pc - it was because of dx10 and my graphics card. after a half of a year i had the new one and checked the SNOW again - with all these SNOWBOARDS and SNOWMOBILES and other useless crap like coats and hats.great game! really. if you dont give a flying ducks about buying ingame stuff its a perfect free game about snowboards - there are few more coming, so lets wait what will happen to snow. its all professional, fx are good, but the scoring is highly questionable - i think developers still balancing it and in the finished state its gonna be huge snowboard simulator. no so ""sim"" like ea skate (which has a great ""feature"" - the whole new system of doing tricks - forget about that ollie+left+flip from thps) but not so frontiers-breaking and techologically perfect. still a great office game if you like snow, boards, ski and snowmobile. huge map, great abilities, but it wont go smooth on an ""office"" computer - u should have something more powerful to make that misty flip over the next two hills8.8/10			",15,2,3,0,4,0,0

								Insanely fun game at the very best price.... $0.00Free roaming the beautiful mountains is peaceful, exhilarating and adventurous. Fitting music too. The mountain is HUGE! I instantly fell in love.You gain experience from free roaming and doing events based on the tricks you do. The exp levels you up and unlocks stuff. There are plenty of different events for you to do. Races, time trials, freestyle events, Speed runs, etc. The amount of memorable moments I had in the first 20 minutes of playing.... it's insane... Crazy jumps off waterfalls and frozen riverbeds, off-piste manuvours that made me crash in hillarious ways, jumping off massive clifs and landing on houses, hotels. Oh man..Multiplayer is brilliant. You can spawn on any players instantly after dying, or at any of the usual spawn points. Plenty of fun moments like accidently crashing into each other at high speeds, mid air. If this were a demo I would happily buy the game.It's early access. Expect plenty more content. Get it. Play it. Enjoy it. Fall in love...			",390,91,23,35,36,2,58

								I grew up always playing games like Cool Boarders, SSX and the Amped series, I always wanted a open world free skiing game. I remember playing Johnny Mosley's Mad Trix but that was a letdown. Saw this game and I knew I had to play it.I just got into the closed beta a few days ago and I'm loving every minute I have played. There are some things that still could be ironed out, but that's a given seeing its still in beta. I can't wait until the next update so I can customize my rider more than what I have.

								A free-to-play open-world skiing game that allows you to free roam online (and offline) in a sizable mountain environment as well as partake in several events. The visuals are nice to look at, the skiing with others can be fun, and the game-world will keep you busy for hours exploring.As of writing this, the restrictions for this free-to-play is primarily cosmetic related, and nothing that stops you from playing really. The prices for cosmetic items aren’t unreasonable – maybe 10-15 pounds to outfit your entire outfit with whatever you want, sort of the price of a typical game. There is no pay-to-win items, as it’s simply cosmetics, and no consumables, so really once you’ve got your looks sorted, that’s likely all you’ll want to spend. Not that you really need to spend any money at all to simply play the game. So if you want to go skiing, or maybe just want to see some snow, then SNOW delivers, with no cost involved at simply trying it for yourself.			",429,87,42,38,43,4,93

								In a post-Steep world, SNOW is a monumental waste of money. The microtransactions are a slap in the face to anyone who backed this game from the beginning. Want to unlock the snowmobile? Have fun grinding to level 65+ without spending a single coin on unlocking levels or any other gear. The business model seems based on the prevalent model for mobile games, and I'd advise people to not give these people your money.			",79,6,5,10,15,1,9

								It's fun, it's beautiful, it has... snow.It delivers on what it claims to be. I'm more of a free-roam kind of player and the maps are beautiful and fun to explore. (...and cold :D )It's been in development for quite some time now, but it is still getting decent updates. I only really paid into it because snowboarding has been a planned feature forever(I'm a boarder irl), but for now It's still pretty fun. The big brand names aren't a huge selling point for me, however I do think it's pretty cool that I can brand match some of my IRL gear and my avatar looks pretty close to what I actually wear.If you're a fan of skiing/snowboarding/skateboarding games, or skiing/snowboarding IRL then this game is worth checking out, especially since it's going to be f2p.

								Very dissapointing.I bought this game ago while it was still around $30 and while it was still in alpha build. After only playing an hour of the alpha build, I got sick of it. The controls were very weird and janky and the menus were glitchy.After hearing it is going into closed beta, I checked it out again as I was already in the closed beta.It got better... I guess... but it still didn't deserve $30. The graphics look pretty nice, and the moutains/courses look fun as hell. If only I could play them... Just kidding, you can play them. But not to what you think a ski game should feel like. The controls in the closed beta weren't any different to the alpha, which is a dissapointment. I think the only improvements that should be made which will make the game 1000x better are:-Better controls-More tricks-Feel faster (going down a hill feels slow as ♥♥♥♥)-Easier to navigate menus (It's hard as jeopardy)-and free, exclusive dlc to those who actually BOUGHT this soon to be free-to-play game.(That last one may be asking too much)To Poppermost, fix your game. This game has so much potential. I was thinking this game would be similar to the EA Skate franchise but to me, it's more similar to playing minesweeper with actual mines. While blindfolded.

I am writing this review while SNOW is in open beta.As an F2P game I think SNOW is really a really amazing winter sports game.It has a big open mountain and few smaller maps (all parks at the moment) on which you can spend hours of exploring.Real life parks/jumps like Sochi (olympic winter games 2014, named Fochi ingame) and the X Games (named S Games ingame). And also a real X Games course! And on the main non-exisiting mountain (Sialia) you have some real life spots like Chad's Gap (on which Tanner Hall 'broke' both his ankles).It has a leveling system with which you can get rewards, think of events, items and credits (ingame currency)If you are a skiër or snowboarder you will probably really like this game.Good graphicsA lot of character customization (which costs credits which you can buy or get by leveling up)Multiplayer is a lot of fun (with friends)Clothing and gear form existing brands like Faction, Head, Red Bull, Scott, Line etc.PC and PS4 cross platform! It isn't advertised as such but believe me, it actually is :)Very nice and active devs (on discord)I flollowed SNOW since december 2013 and it has made improvements over the time, there were not that much updates but when they pushed out one, it was a big one. (not always very stable, but I can't blame anyone since it is early acces).You can also talk directly with the developers and the active community on the official discord server! (link on the steam forum)So yeah..It basically is an awesome wintersports game with a few minor bugs that I would really recommend to try since it is free to play.9/10 Would crash into a friend again			",75,8,9,3,7,0,8

								I've played this for a few moments but long enough to know some of the good and bad points of the game in its current state. First the good:Fabulous visuals and a soundtrack that complements the overall scenery and gameplayPlanned features like snowboarding (snowmachining too please?)HUGE area, no boundaries that ive found though you will get stuck if you arent careful.WINTER SPORTS ON PC!Microtransactions are cosmetic only (Please keep it this way, no pay2win plz.)(Snowball fights please :P)The negative (Soon to be fixed id imagine)Jumping mechanics are a bit wonky and your jump height is a little low (Being a snowboarder a can verify that it is possible to jump higher than 1ft.)Controls need to be reworked for controllers (holding forward on the control stick should make you lean forward instead of holding the button. Prepping for a jump should not impede your ability to turn and should also provide the speed boost that ducking provides. There are a number of other things but these are the most prominent.)The above are really the only things i see wrong atm.I have played a lotm of amp'd and shawn white snowboarding and I definately see a huge amount of potential for this game. Good work so far devs, keep it up!			",152,39,3,27,15,1,9

								Get the game. Its free-to-play so it doesnt hurt to get it anyway. It obviously has the qualities of an Early Access game so it has its bugs. Sometimes you have to restart at the open screen if it doesnt come up with the credits, after some events it will restart the game. However, if you can look past the tiny bugs then this game is a super cool snowboarding / skiing game.You can do events, time trials and free roaming. Level up to get in game coins and buy stuff. It's such a chill, beautiful game if you can look past your derpy looking character. 8/10 recommend.			",68,17,1,13,7,1,3

								I love that there is a open mountain skiing game but...in alpha there was an amazing selection of skis and gear and the second it hit beta we lost everything...I know this should not be a huge deal but the fact that I could use my own gear I really own was awesome and now we get 1 of each peice and they do not look nice.1 gross jacket, 1 ugly set of skis (2 if you count the old single tips you get from paying for the game)also the fact that they made every last thing cost money you would think that those of us that payed more way earlier would at least get some in game tokens to get back a small peice of the gear we once had for free... but no.Its an enjoyable game and if you could care less about what your character looks like then go for it!but I honestly feel cheated having access to all this stuff at alpha and nothing now... I already have to pay for all this gear in real life like common haha.I may just be over reacting due to the fact that I had access to all of this stuff at one point so if you never played the Alpha then I think you may enjoy this but coming from having more earlier...it kind of seems like a back step to me.I have to give it a thumbs down tho due to the fact the last update seemed to strip the game clean in the gear area			",134,29,7,38,32,2,22

								Haven't been able to complete the tutorial because of 'basic grab' bug. The game gives you the information, you do exactly what the game told you, nothing happens and you have to restart. It really seems that this game is going to be great in the future, but my review is the result of what it looks today.Pros:- Good looking scenario- Free- If working properly, seems to be a good and fun gameCons:- Bugs- I really don't know more than that, because I lost patience to a particular upsetting bug.4/10 with bugs8/10 If they fix it.

								First off, lets just say this game has had its fair share of bugs and glitches. When i first purchased snow, the game sometimes wouldn't even run. The menus were terrible and the multiplayer never worked. Now, this game is improved beyond imagining. The menus are beautiful, There are multiple mountains, the graphics are outsanding, and there is virtually no lag. This is one of the best games i have ever played, especially since the new update. My only gripe with this game is the in-game purchases. However, if you do not mind this, then please get this game. I give it a 9/10. OUTSTANDING.			",135,15,1,7,13,1,9

								Got into the closed beta when it first came out and loved it. Played it for more that 100 hours. But they slowed down production and for a while it seemed the project was dead, so I stopped playing. A while later I went on youtube and saw that it was all over my front page and I was super excited because I thought they came out of beta and added all they promised! But the reason it was on the front page was because they completely broken the game and all of its physics (or lack there of). I was dissapointed but still had some fun with my friends.

Just today I got a message from steam saying that they finally added snowboarding, the one thing that I wanted from this game, but seemed like an unachievable goal. I was curious to see what they've added and the game is now huge. Its honestly amazing to me that they have gotten this far. Can't wait to see where it goes from here.			",611,138,25,54,64,12,66

								At the present time, I do not recommend purchasing this game. Although the concept is awesome, and I'm really excited to play this when it's finished however - this is not a playable game just yet. Lots of bugs, lots of errors, lots of crashes.Bide your time for a little longer and buy this when it becomes 100% ready to play. I see great things for this game in the future, but no, not right now.******** UPDATE: 1 YEAR LATER (April 2015)I bit the bullet and tried playing this game again, and I must say it has improved massively since a year ago as I actually managed to ski down a slope. Some progress at last! However, it still lacks a certain oooomph. You have to pay for extras, which is absolutely ludicrous. I feel like they could have done a lot more to the game in the whole year that I have been waiting to play again. In my opinion, it's STILL not ready to be released as a full game, as it just feels unfinished to me. I will come back to this review in a few months to try once again.			",75,9,1,3,13,1,5

								I dont usually write reviews about gaes but after the last update i do feel like i have to. The was real good fun until the last update which ♥♥♥♥ed up pretty much everything there is to ♥♥♥♥ up. I have a pc capable of running this game at 60ish fps on ultra settings so that isnt the problem, but since the last update, even on lowest settings, it is impossible to ride down a mountain without crashing into a tree or a arock because they now just randomly pop up 10m infront of you without a warning. This is really annoying because there is nothing you can do about it. Furthermore loading times have increased a lot. They have at least trippled. And another thing i cant stand at all are microtransactions. You can buy items (eg. skis, jackets, goggles) at the ingame shop for funds which you can earn by playing - or you just take the easy approach and buy them for real life money. (500 for 5 dollars from which you can buy like two goggles)Before this update i would have said buy this game, go for it it is awsome. Afterward it sucks really bad. If it stays this way, which i hope it wont i wont advise anyone to buy it.			",60,10,7,6,19,1,10

								Keep an open mind...I've been playing for a good 27+ hours, and I'm level 33. This game is obviosly still in development meaning that its not perfect. leveling up is tedious and you get paid only every 5 levels but the pay does increase but they did this for a reason, since the game is free they want you to buy the money packs so that you can buy what you want and fund them at the same time. So I see both sides of the equasion, players want the money to be more easily earned but also the developer is giving the game for free and making profit off of the money packs. I haven't bought any money pack or plan on it at all because i dont mind the grind too much for making the money but I would rather have a sense of accomplishment and make a smaller amount every level and have that build up. Also a reason I do enjoy this game so much is because I haven't had a good snowboarding game to play since Amped 3 and that game is in a gengre of it's own but anyways Amped 3 game me a childhood dream to go out and snowboard, and this game furthur feeds that dream. All in all this game has its problems but with more work and funding I'm sure it will become an amazing final product			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
