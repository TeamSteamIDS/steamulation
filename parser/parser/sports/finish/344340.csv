												Front Office Football Seven shines as a career sports management sim about the game of American Football. You can play an unlimited number of seasons, choosing to build and rebuild your team through the draft, free agency, and/or trading. It has a strong and challenging Single Player AI, and has full 32-human multi-player capabilities as well. If you've ever wanted to try to run an NFL franchise, you definitely want to give this game a shot. There is an active user community at Front Office Football Central[www.operationsports.com], a fansite frequented by Jim Gindin, the solo developer of Front Office Football and founder of Solecismic Software.I have owned every version of FOF, dating back to 1998, and in my opinion, this is easily the best version ever, a fitting upgrade to an excellent series.

												Kiss your family goodbye! Fantasy football and Football Manager had a baby and that kid's name is Front Office Football. I've spent as many hours as you can expect a human to spend on any game, and I still don't have everything down yet- which is good. I want to feel like every decision in a simulator matters. I want to believe that when I play multi-player in one of FOF's many online leagues (GML, V2, RDFL and NAFL to name a few), that there's a combination of decisions I can make to one day stomp all the old-timers that have been playing this game for over a decade! Great communities will support you through the learning process, super competitive leagues will challenge your decision making, and Nick will make you feel bad about trading your draft picks away FOREVER.Buy this game, look up those leagues, and tell the kids to go play outside. You've got decisions to make- and so far, you're 3 for 3!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very realistic (American) football management sim where you base your decisions primarily off of your players statistical numbers and ingame performance (like real life). This game does a very good job at simulating accurate numbers for both the players in real life and the players it creates through the draft. It's fun taking control of a team that's a QB away from playoff contention and trying to find your guy in the draft and turning him into a franchise QB. The best thing about this game, however, is the playability. It's accessible by pretty much anybody's timeframe in one way: you can sim entire seasons in less than a minute, get right back to offseason, and keep building your team. Or, if you prefer, you can sit back and watch detailed text based action unfold, adding a suspense aspect to this game. Even for its debatably steep price, I would definitely recommend this game to (American) football enthusiasts. We've waited a long time for a good football sim.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Madden sent me here.That is a true story.  I have played Madden since the 93 version on my Sega.  It was so great when they finally added franchise mode and then added the draft.  I loved drafting players and playing multiple seasons to see how they progressed.  On into the 2000s we got 3D, motion capture, and all these fancy graphics.  That was great eye candy, but man did it slow down the draft.  I wanted to look at every  player and every stat of every player to make sure that linebacker I was targeting at round 2 pick 7 was going to fit my vision and help the team out.  That took forever.  Sure having their picture there added to immersion, but when you got to fictional players it really didn't matter.  It was just another generic face.Then I discovered the greatness of Front Office Football.  I could peruse the draft class in minutes.  I could filter by linebacker.  I could see all of his stats in a bar graph that easily let me make a decision if he was a fit or not.  I could create a gameplan to fit my new first round running back.  I could see the results of my planning.  I was in love with this game.   How could it get any better?   Well if it had the fancy 3D game replays that would be great!  EA tried that with a game about a head coach.  I didn't like it at all.  It was still cumbersome to get through the menus and get to what really mattered.  If I wanted to watch every play of the game I could do it with the FOF replay.  Sure it was text, but it was fast and had colorful text that told me what was happening on the field.  The stats gave me the overall view so I could easily see what my competitors in my division were doing.  I could get through a whole season in an afternoon and get a great feeling of acomplishment.  How could it get any better?I discoverd multiplayer leagues!  Now multiplayer was nothing new.  Madden had it.  You could play against your buddy who you just knew was looking at your side of the screen and figuring out which play you called.  At least until they added the bluff system.  Most football games had some sort of multiplayer.  No this was differnet.  Every team could be represented by a real living person.  It wasn't a bunch of button mashing and test of reflexes.  It was a test of the brain and preparation.  You could build your team through the draft or free agency and then create your perfect offensive and defensive game plans.  Once the commisioner had everyone's  gameplan then it was on!  FOF managed to simulate up to 16 games and send out the results.  Results that could then be replayed in the game viewer play by play.  It took a little bit of imagination to see your players preforming a pancake block or a diving catch, but it was there and it was uncanny acurate compared to the NFL.  Then there came that day that you get to the Super Bowl!  After playing all year against 32 humans!  This team that you built up storms the field and ....  how could it get any better?It was just released on Steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
