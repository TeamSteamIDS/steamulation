AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Splatter - Blood Red Edition Original Release: 2014 Genre Tags: Action; Top-Down Shooter; Noir; Mindless Fun; Local-Coop My Overall Grade: B+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 3-8 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Auxiliary (Local) Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Casual gamers; Arcade gamers REVIEWSplatter - Blood Red Edition is a simplistic and entertaining top-down shooter with a graphic-noir theme. There isn’t much depth to the gameplay or storyline, but it is pleasantly addictive and has an engaging pace of progress that will suck you in. It is a great game to consider if you are a fan of the genre and are looking for some easily digestible gameplay.The narrative is decent; but really nothing spectacular. But the dark theme and setting of the game is well done and enjoyable. The artwork and cutscenes are pleasantly sculpted in classic graphic-noir style. The atmosphere definitely elevates an otherwise adequate, but lackluster narrative; and together they generate a solid presentation.The gameplay is quite simple. You use one hand to control your character and the other to point and shoot; you can use a controller or a keyboard + mouse. As you progress you will find new weapons and can apply upgrades to make your arsenal stronger. There are also several enemy types, boss encounters, and unique gameplay segments which all help prevent the gameplay from growing stale as you beat the campaign.Besides the campaign, there is also some auxiliary content. This comes in the form of local multiplayer; both PvP and co-op horde mode. If you happen to have any real life friends, you can maybe have a bit of fun with those for a few hours. If you don't have friends, you also can play the horde mode solo and compete on leaderboards.Splatter - Blood Red Edition mostly will appeal to anyone who likes the genre, and is looking for a simple and fun game that is easy to experience. It is the perfect type of game to play if you want to take a break between playing those forty-hours-to-beat, open world epics.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												""Here i find myself in the midst of chaos,but everything breaks if exposed to enough pressure"" listening to that and watching the static cinema that came with it i thought i was in a ""MAX PAYNE"" game,but no i was in the rather enjoyable and action packed shooter that is ""SPLATTER : BLOOD RED EDITION"".Ok when you start to play you wake up in your house and after some rambling to yourself wander of outside,*BANG* bullets everywhere and the army telling you to get of the street you follow them and then you get to find your first weapon the obligatory hand gun (which has infinite ammo,of course it does DUH).As the game progressess you gain acess to more powerfull and impressive weapons (shotgun,rocket launcher ECT) and trust me when i tell you,you are going to need them as some of the boss battles and even some of the normal battles (you do get over run at times) get quite hard and the enemy can overwhelm you if you use the wrong weapon.Now the most easiest and best way to help from getting overcome is to throw a flare,see the dark abomination's you face have a fear and total dislike of the light (""wonder where we have seen this game play element before"" ""i dont know ALAN,WAKE up"") which can give you time to re-gather your thoughts and blow them away whilst they scuttle away from the bright and painfull light that encompasses them.This game play mechanic is one that you will use to your advantage on numerous occasions and will save your neck more than once.As the game plays on you will encounter some puzzles but they are usually of the push button variety and are allways easy to overcome and you will never feel lost as to what to do next and this is a good thing as the action should (and does) take a front seat to all else in game.The graphics in game do a good job and for this sort of game handle really well with no lag no matter how many enemies are on screen (shouldent be in this sort of game),the music in game is good but at times you do find that the spoken dialogue is overshadowed by the music or the gunfire happening in game (minor quibble but i did miss out on some conversations due to this).The story and script are both good and at times you do feel like you are in a different game (MAX PAYNE anyone),but at times it does feel all a little B-MOVIE but actually this is not a bad thing and does suit this game right down to the ground.Will you play this game and would you want to even buy it,well enjoy a game that is all bang for its buck and want something that will itch those trigger finger blues then i would say yes,if that doesnt sound like you and you want more from your game than gun blasting action then i would say look elswhere.In my humble opinion this is one enjoyable blast and i would fully reccomend it just dont expect it to be one of the best games you have ever played just one of the best blasters you have ever played and enjoy it for what it is ""ONE HELL OF A BLASTING GOOD TIME"" ",2023,1178,31,261,147,8,209

												One of the best topdown shooters I've played in ages totally worth the price. The story is pretty good compared to most of the games in this genre and I found myself laughing a lot at some of the dialogue between characters, game difficulty is also challenging (I've completed it on normal so far) and plan to go back in on the higher settings. Keep in mind the story is 4-6 hours long but the quality of the content alone is more than worth it!.			",506,54,6,63,30,1,49

												It's not as much survival like ""Teleglitch"", nor is it a hell of fun like ""Loaded"" (PS1). *But it's a solid Top-Down Shooter nonetheless with many critters to kill and funny punch lines.* It's not survival with infinite ammo for your main gun and it's not fun when you constantly run out of ammo for the cool guns.

												For reasons unknown to anyone, my final moments with Splatter saw me facing off against Cthulhu and his many rocket launching♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥as I danced around acid pits trying to chop off his alarmingly phallic artillery.I suppose then it goes without saying that Splatter is incredibly, impossibly dumb. It goes far beyond the point of reason with its violence and scenarios, giving you access to an outrageous arsenal and filling the screen with hundreds of enemies at a time, and yet remains entirely blank faced the whole way through. It even tries its hand at juvenile social commentary, which is almost cute in its earnestness. Anytime our gritty, social outcast of a protagonist would open his mouth to growl through a few lines I couldn’t help but burst into laughter, amazed at how all the worst elements of video game narratives had come together in front of me to put on a delightfully awful show.Splatter makes a good case for ironically enjoying media, but underneath the pitiful writing it’s also one of the best twin stick shooters I’ve played in ages. Each weapon feels uniquely powerful and fun to use against the torrents of enemies assaulting you at any given time. There is no greater complexity here than aiming in whichever direction the most enemies are coming from, but it’s a satisfying simplicity that is switched up enough through boss fights and different level designs to stay engaging for the three or so hours the campaign lasts. The impressive lighting effects definitely help, with the splashes of gunshots and explosions completely distracting from the more rudimentary texture work which gives good cause to have most levels take place at night when they are most eye catching.I hadn’t initially intended to play through all of Splatter, and yet I’m more glad to have finished it than even many games I’d consider better. It’s an excellent shooter, and there really isn’t anything quite as hysterical as watching our gruff lead clutch at his fedora and make meaningless asides on the dangers of science and industry. It’s one of the few games I can say I enjoyed both ironically and genuinely, for very different but equally entertaining reasons.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												Splatter – Blood Red Edition is a top down twin-stick shooter set right at the outbreak of a zombie invasion.  The game begins as you, Max, wakes up in his apartment with the sound of gunfire and havoc outside...The story while not particularly original, science goes wrong and the result is zombies, is told very well through a series of old school Max Payne like panels and all characters are fully voiced.  The VO is decent and the English translation could use some work, but there is an awful lot of style here in the story-telling.  The best part of the story is there is no Mr/Ms Exposition to be found, all the characters you meet along the way are in as bad a situation as you, knowing very little of what is going on, they are just trying to survive.  The game takes place across more than a dozen levels with optional sub quests and boss fights mixed in. As said, the view is top down and the graphics are very good for the price.  Light plays a huge part in the game-play and is translated very well here, how is bends round corners and through doorways.  Very early on in the game you find yourself overwhelmed and here the primary mechanic comes into play, using light to scare off the zombies via either from ambient sources, or from thrown flares.  Charging head long into a darkened area full of zombies ensures a quick death.  Vehicles also play a part in the game, from riding shotgun on the back of a truck with a machine gun to mowing down the zombies in a combine harvester.There are many guns to pick up, from the initial pistol with unlimited ammo, to grenade launchers, Laser guns, shotguns, flame throwers and more.  All the weapons can be upgraded up to 4 times and the extra damage and abilities will become vital to your survival.  Upgrades come through purchasing them at work benches with cash you collect that is lying around the levels, or inside destructibles.  You can also collect pieces of a golden pistol that eventually provides an extremely powerful upgrade to the pistol.  Since the pistol is the only weapon with unlimited ammo and you can't purchase ammo, only pick it up, the pistol will quickly become your best friend.Things can get very hectic at higher levels and will provide a very good challenge to even the best players.  All in all this is very good example of the genre at the lower price scale and the story will keep you interested to the end.7.5/10			",2237,887,83,268,310,28,351

												I figured this would be a little, generic Crimsonland-like top-down shooter. MAN was I surprised. It is a clever, funny, brutal, bloody tactical action shooter with RPG-esque bits (leveling your weapons), boss fights, and a story. If you like this type of game, buy this. It is a highly playable, entertaining game with an interesting-enough story to keep you moving ahead for just a bit longer. Max is a hard-bitten, sarcastic mook in a violent zombie-ridden world... so he fits right in. Enjoy!			",160,25,0,17,4,0,12

												Didn't know what to expect when I got this, actually, that's a lie. I expected a solid top-down shooter.Turns out, that's pretty much exactly what this is... and not much else.The story is so utterly forgettable, maybe with the exception of the final area/boss, that it's almost an accomplishment. Especially the protagonist, who I'm sure is called Max Blanderson, has 0 character traits beyond the fact that he feels the need to narrate everything as if this was a Film Noir crime novel... except he only ever saw Sin City.All in all there's nothing wrong with this game. It's a fun little romp that clocks in at ~3 hours.There's a decent weapon variety that can be upgraded using cash found around the levels to increase their effectiveness and there's some side quests and collectibles strewn about to make your life easier.Pick it up if you feel like having some simple fun.

												I'm relatively new to using steam for anything other than FM, but have recently fell into the trap of trawling through the specials and sales when they crop up. I stumbled across this game and almost turned a blind eye due to it being 15p! YES! 15p! Now I do casual gaming, but im not an expert. For it's price, even at full amount, this game is an absolute steal. I like the look of top down shooters and this one really doesnt disappoint. I've only invested the last 2 hours into this game, but I was so pleasantly surprised that I thought I better make this game my first review. There is a loose story line, which so far pretty much fits your stereotypical zombie genre. The character you play as is pretty badass and the level blood and guts is there with every kill. I've played Hotline Miami recently and thoroughly enjoyed it, this has a similar feel to it, but with more enemies, leveling up and combined with a great looking backdrop. This review might not help the hardcore gamer, but for people relatively new to steam and indie games, this is the kind of stuff you're looking for, in fact, for 15p this is what everyone is looking for!

												Great top-down shooter, great quality, good story, you could have some fun killing some zombies and other creatures. I loved the detail that when you are low in health the colors turns black and white. The story is short, I guess it took me like 4 hours to finish it. It has a couple of cons:- You can only replay the full story so you can't choose a specific chapter- Your finger will die of clicking so many times when using the revolver :pAlso had a bug in the final boss battle that the autosave was made in the instant I was killed so it entered in a loop, but luckily I had another autosave from a bit before.I really didn't expect much of it, great surprise.

 Nice little shooter, with surprisingly detailed world, Sin City inspired cutscenes and funny dialoque Having just finished the main story on Nasty-difficulty, the highest you can get on the first playthrough i think i've seen most of this game. Maniac difficulty next, you will unlock it after finishing the game.Top-down shooter, plays like you'd think it shuold. Only thing that bothered me in this was how the screen went black and white when my health was down. It made enemies sometimes hard to see, and my cursor was lost there as well because there's a lot happening at times on the levels. Other than that, it was a cool effect. Few deaths because of the unclear screen, but nothing too annoying. That's pretty much the only complaint i have for game. The levels are interesting, they're not too linear, contain secrets (Yes, i am a sucker for hunting secrets in games). Weapons can be upgraded with money you find in the levels (and you guessed it, at the secrets!). Upgrading system is simplistic, you can only buy another level with money to the weapon. It seemed there wasn't enough money to upgrade all the weapons, which is a nice little touch. You shuold choose 2-3 main ones you will be using, otherwise you will end up with only mediocre weapons and the later stages of the game will be way harder.Cutscenes are drawn like panels in a comic book, strongly reminiscent of Sin City comics. We play as a bit too smart♥♥♥♥♥hero to my liking, but most of the dialoque was positively funny, and seemed to be thought out a bit before starting to make the game. The developer said he was planning to make a sequel, but that idea has been abandoned. Shame, it wuold have been great to have more of this. Especially since the story ended how it ended, shows a sequel was planned. Shuold you buy it?Yes! At 19cents that i paid for it, it's a steal. Quality indie game, cutscenes are great to look at, game is ok fun for 5-8 hours. Survival mode is fun to fire up for a few rounds here and there when you have time to kill.			",396,158,8,45,43,3,41

												Splatter is a game that I grew immensely fond of. Splatter is that game that is exactly what it sets out to be. It's simple, top-down-Postal-style fun. The character is cheesy in an endearingly 90's way. He wears a trench coat & Fedora for the sake of being what it is. His lines with his style do add an immense sense of humor to the whole thing, but the whole game is like that.Splatter gave me that feeling of a classic action movie. Goofy, over-the-top & overall completely worth a play and a New Game+. Yes, if you beat the game it does continue as a ""New Story"" with a New Game +.I don't need to say a lot of things about it for it do its job. That is the best part. Splatter is clean, old-fashioned zombie killing fun at a reasonable price that you can play as long as you want without really getting bored. I have no flaws to really pick at it other than I wish it was a bit longer, there were some typos here and there and the sound design can be a bit overbearing. I really wish a sequel would come out because actually it really reminded me of the Decision Series of Zombie Flash games all over the web. I want to see it really be a bigger & better game.Really enjoyed it; 8/10Length: Short (2 to 4 hours)			",191,46,2,44,17,0,13

												Yet another zombie game...That's what I thought when I first heard about this game. I've played several games like this and most of them are boring and repetitive.Splatter has something different, new, something that kept my attention. The game is simple but complete and offer everything I wanted from a game like this. It is not a jumpscare game, of course, but you can feel the thriller atmosphere.The game is quite simple, you move, aim and shot zombies. There are some items to help like flares. Collect money that are used for weapon upgrades and the weapons you get from the map just like money and bullets. You will face regular enemies, special enemies and bosses. As you'd expect from a zombie game, regular zombies are no threat if alone but they can provide a real challenge if in crowds.The game presents you some choices that will affect the game for a short period so it is up to you which path you'll take, ""in the end, it doesn't even matter"".You can choose between 3 game modes: History, Multiplayer and Arcade.The Multiplayer is local and you can play with up to 3 friends (4 in total), inside the multiplayer you still have 2 options. Player vs Player (where you can to kill each other) and Coop where you and your friends have to kill the zombies.The Arcade is very challenging, you are supposed to face hordes of zombies that comes in waves. They will drop weapons, bullets and items.Best part, Splatter is translated to Portuguese (not brazilian)8/10			",2074,754,105,258,280,33,334

												You guys, this game is adorable.Splatter is a twin-stick zombie shooter in the vein of... hell, pick something. Your character embarks on an epic, rain-soaked journey from his living room to a mysterious government lab in search of the source of the mutant undead plague that has torn your city apart. On your quest you find a wide assortment of weapons, along with cash to upgrade them. The upgrade system is a particularly good one, allowing you multiple upgrades on a single weapon to turn it into an absurd all-in-one death-dealer. There's a surprising amount of content in each of the game's lengthy levels. Several have NPCs you can interact with, as well as optional sidequests for additional weapons and ammo. Some are centered around clever setpieces like a subway ride or a thresher driving sequence. Then there are additional secrets to find like armor upgrades and golden gun parts that I'm not clear on the purpose of, but by now it should be clear that there's plenty to do in the game's dozen or so open levels. Worth mentioning also that, aside from the gory action, there are some genuinely tense sections thanks to the lighting and encounter design in some of the darkened buildings and narrow corridors.What makes this game adorable is the presentation. Your ""hero"" is a fedora-wearing trenchcoat-clad iconoclast who can't help but be a condescending♥♥♥♥♥♥to everyone he meets. I can't overstate this... in the cutscene where you arrive at the shopping mall, he monologues about how the place once attracted a different mindless herd of consumers. You're essentially playing the EUPHORIC guy unironically and it makes the game like ten times funnier than it should be. I honestly can't tell if it's a giant parody or if you're supposed to be taking his gravelly fussing seriously, but either way it elevates the game from bargain-basement shooter to something special. Coupled with the solid gameplay, graphics, and level design, Splatter proved to be an unexpected gem.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

												Extremely fun and addictive. Worth every cent.The story goes around your typical zombie infestation, starred by a cynical yet handy guy. Nothing special about him, except for the interesting interactions and ocasional collaborations with other AIs. The story is good and makes sense. Overall is a very good fast-paced game. Fast, fluid and fun to stress out for a while. Repeatable, specially the arcade modes, to get high scores.The easy mode is piece of cake, but funny if you want to cause maximum damage. The most difficult mode is exasperating and even passing the first final boss will take you out of your nerves.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love FPS games - I'm awful at them, but I still love them. What's not to love about shooting and blowing things up??With that said, I love this game! It's in black and white (except for the blood) resembling a 1930's or 1940's film. And you can shoot  and blow up just about everything. Fire a gun at a car and it blows up, hopefully taking a lot of zombies with it. Shoot boxes and you might find money (used to upgrade your weapons), shells, or other goodies.  As a matter of fact, you have to blow up everything you can to find hidden switches to get into hidden areas. There are secret areas that can be accessed if you can find the switch that lets you in.Both controller and keyboard are supported. I like using the mouse for aiming and shooting (I'm a complete spaz with the controller on shooting), so I have to live with the keyboard for movement (total spaz there, too!).An excellent feature (and a way to know that you're just about ready to die!) is the auto save.  The game will auto save just before a big battle where you could (and I generally did until I figured out the right strategy) die. That's the other thing I love about this game - there is strategy involved. If you use your resources wisely, you can get through even boss battles. If you like shooters, blowing things up, or zombies, you'll love this game. Recommended for beginers as well as more experienced players.			",552,322,18,139,68,2,160

												It's a good budget title. Just note that the game works best when you disable v-sync. I had it on and was topping at 20FPS, turned it off and went up to a steady 60FPS throughout the entire game. Aside from that it was a good game. Plays like a top down twin stick shooter and feels like a resident evil game with the atmosphere, the monsters and even the cheesy dialogue. Although once the story mode is over, there is not much to go back on. There is survival mode where you take on hordes of zombies and monsters but it gets repetitive after a while. I rate this a 7/10.			",1035,339,17,132,84,7,136

												Do you like Top-Down Shooters?If yes, then you must try this one.Its very cheap, but made with the soul and effort.Good: scenario, weaponry, enemies, environment (very destructable), music, Max Payne-styled comics etcBad: NOTHING at all! In my opinion of course.I played three times (normal difficulty, easy achievment speedrun and 'maniac' (hard) run), got 100% achievments and I am fully satisfied with 11 hours of gameplay, therefore highly recommended, even at full price!

												It is a very fun top-down shooter. You are going to kill lots of zombies. It has enough different kind of weapons,enemies and environments.The game can be finished in 4-5 hours which is good considering it is 19 cents on sales.			",133,8,0,6,3,0,1

												Splatter - Zombie Apocalypse feels like the 1st GTA with zombies; The game is very detailed and has preety cool soundtrack  & gameplay too. Also after the 10th chapter the difficulty becomes a bit...harder. Also for it's  value (0.19 cents) it's quite a gem; i can only recommend it. i'd put a 9/10;			",62,12,0,21,5,0,4

												formulaic topdown zombie shooterwhy is it remarkable? it works. - gameplay, game and control mechanics are solid, - story is not bad at all.- technically it is not flawless - alt+tab does not work - but that is the only complaint.i only wish it had real coop or online multiplayer mode.

												I highly recommend you grab this.Where they say hotline miami and resident evil in the game description, I feel more like POSTAL and resident evil gameplay wise.All and all, it is amazing and fair. You can have monsters stay back with flares or light. So using those smart, you can easily survive.The controls are super simple and smooth. The story isn't terrible, though.. Kinda wish Max wasn't a totally♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ALL THE TIME.All the bosses are fair and different, each one needing a different way to kill it, with ZERO info how. No hand holding, you need to figure it out on your own.Tons of useful weapons and plenty of ammo to find.There is a multiplayer, but.. sadly not story wise. which would of been amazing and fun.I got this on a sale, so all I can say, worth every cent. lol. played it several time, and wanna play it some more.8/10			",157,7,1,15,4,1,3

												A very pleasant surprise in what on the surface looks like a run of the mill top-down shooter, ends up being a very solid and fun 10 hour experience. Gameplay is familiar to anyone who's played a top-down shooter, controls handle well and the guns feel as powerful as they should. Exploration is rewarded in the way of upgrades and cash which is always nice and the weapon upgrade system feels rewarding. Many upgrades are quite significant and go beyond the basic ""+damage"".The story is basic but still enough to keep you engaged, and the film-noir take on the zombie apocalypse is pretty interesting.Overall, well worth your time if you like this kind of game or if you're just looking for a change of pace from FPS/TPS shooters.

												I've heard this game compared to Hotline Miami, but to me it's much less twitchy and re-playing-based than that game. I would compare it to Max Payne in Left 4 Dead from a top down perspective. So it's fun and it's also got cool cut scenes and themeing.Everything you want in a twin stick shooter Difficult. It's not easy, especially when you don't have flares yet. To be honest I had to bump it down to easy mode and still died now and then. But it's better to be challenged than to be bored, in my book. Style. This game is very stylish and I love that. Humor. It's not wackyrandom or jokey but dark narration and tone really bring a grin to your face, especially when the protagonist gets worked up. Action. So much blood. Blood everywhere. So much shooting. So much destructible items. So much explosions. Multiplayer. Local co-op, or local versus.  Online leader boards for everything.  Arcade mode. Twin stick shooters are arcade games, really, so I always hope to see arcade mode. Controller support. I use a Steam controller and it works great. Although I did find the community profile to work better than the default, for aiming.Production values. Voice acted throughout, this doesn't look like a AAA game but it doesn't have the cut corners you see on many indie top down games.TLDR: it's a good one and a good price. Install it if you own it and give it a spin!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this game for free, and I'm really glad I got a chance to try it out! It's a top down shooting game, kind of like Hotline Miami but without the stealth elements. It's really fast paced and exciting, and the story is voice acted and a lot more interesting than most zombie shooters. I really like that it has co-op available for up to 4 players and the online leader boards after each level are great too. It really makes the game work as a high score contest or as a story.
