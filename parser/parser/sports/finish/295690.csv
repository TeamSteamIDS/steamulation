Particle Mace is a masterful lesson in game design that with its perfect scoring system and haunting beautiful abstract world will put you in some sort of hypnotic trance. While you leave your mind behind you, tracing circles like in a Sufi whirling dance ritual. One of the most captivating game experiences since Tetsuya Mizoguchi’s Rez, that gives a true meaning to the expression videogames as an art formIn my first 5 minutes with Particle Mace, I wasn’t so impressed. Sure, the main mechanic was original and a brilliant twist respect to the typical twin stick shooter. But I wasn’t able to understand why it was the favorite game for some of my most beloved friends. But after I spent half an hour with it, when I dominated its psychics mechanics and I understood its scoring system realizing the masterful and completely perfect game design behind it, I became anxious.I felt my pulse accelerated with each heartbeat sending unconscious signals to my mind. Full of binary coded verses talking about the overwhelming sense of beauty suspended in the abstract and almost ethereal world behind Particle Mace.It’s the same sense of accomplishment that you can feel when you meet for the first time a lifetime love, this person who you will spend some of your more pleasant and intimate moments. Sometimes this tempestuous love will induce you to obfuscation, making you to feel a bit dumb about yourself for every bad step taken in your relationship, this meteor that you stupidly crashed while you were concentrated trying to evade a pursuing enemy’s red ship. But then you reconcile with it and the previously induced rage only takes you to a next and much more passionate encounter in which you have a better understanding of every particle in its body, allowing you to achieve a higher score.Sometimes, Particle Mace is a meditative experience that puts you in some sort of state of trance while you are tracing circles at a constant pace that flows like a mantra. An experience similar to a Sufi whirling dance ritual in which the participants are able to elevate his minds from his bodies through the constant act of swirling with the rhythm of the music.At other times, Particle Mace turns into a fast pace and frantic arcade experience with the screen inundated with menacing objects floating in the vastness of space. And you feel inside of a space opera, while you maneuver your ship tracing impossible parables. Creating complex strategies to destroy the enemy ships, trying to not lose the momentum while you increase even more an epic chain of explosions.It has a perfectly crafted level design, that like Nintendo’s most beloved classics, works on a two-dimensional level of complexity. There is a first layer in the game that makes it instantly pleasant to play only to be absorbed in its universe, being an experience close to meditation and with a main mechanic that is instantly fun. And then comes with its second layer of complexity, because the better you learn its level structure, scoring system and enemies patterns, the more you can improve your runs in a competitive way. In each run you can feel your progress, how you have a better knowledge of the game rules every time. At the end, destroying the enemies becomes an instinctive reflex skill.Particle Mace is a game almost eternal. Its three main infinite modes are truly differentiated among them. Each mode has a completely different layout with a diverse range of challenges that can immensely alter the gameplay. And every layout is in a constant change. The more you score, the more new elements are included. Its level of creativity is incredible, slowly introducing new ideas, patterns and obstacles.And then you have a glorious 150 missions mode that constantly amazes you with new design ideas, new menaces, new rules. This mode exhibits a level of ingenuity in its construction that is on par with the constant sense of surprise and novelty found in each of the levels of Super Mario Galaxy. With Particle Mace, Andy Wallace reveals himself as one of the better videogame designers of his generation.And all of this is embraced with one of the most beautiful and evocative abstract worlds seen since Tetsuya Mizoguchi’s Rez. The game is enveloped by a special sense of loneliness, an intense feeling of melancholy and introspection that can let us spend hundred of hours in it, while we’re absorbed in a universe constructed via suspended and ethereal backgrounds. A feeling that is intensified thanks to a hypnotic soundtrack that rises in a perfect crescendo to highlight the most action packed moments.Particle Mace is one of these games that like Rez years before, makes that you couldn’t conceive a single hard work day that not end in feeling for a mere instant its abstract beauty while you are immersed in the still of the night. Captivating your soul and showing you the true meaning of the expression videogames as an art form.( The writer of this review is not an English native. So you should expect occasional grammar errors. I apologize in advance. ) ",654,347,7,89,29,3,33

												DISCLAIMER: I was given a key for free by the publisher!Don't let the minimalist graphics and the easy pick-up and play game mechanics fool you, this little at first glance casual style arena-based (area-based, where you have to stay in a defined space that will eventually start moving and change shape) smash enemies and asteroids game has the potential to let you become hooked. Whether you are going for high scores in the 3 arcade modes (easy, hard, asteroids) or try to do special objectives in mission mode, I find myself easily trying over and over again.This is a definitve recommendation: simple gameplay mechanics, high replayabilty and easy addiction!

												This is one of those games you don't need much time to get the full taste.It's a mix of Geometry Wars and Astroid, except with a heavy dose of physics.If you're an achievement hunter, be sure you have another person to play with, or at least a controller, as at least 7 achievements require Co-op or deathmatches and sadly multiplayer is local only.Controls are very tricky and will take time to get use to.Seems like a fun game to mess around or kill time, and the missions do get gradually harder.Personally I'm rather indifferent about it, mainly because of the local co-op only achievements that really unease me... for now I'll pick yes but this may change to a no later in the future if needed.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.

Early Access Review
								PARTICLE MACE is a frantic blast of space trash smash'emup action where you will spin it to win it. The elegant movements of your ship are like a ballet of geometrical anarchy. In the same way that games like Nidhogg bring the local multiplayer insanity to the platforming brawler genres, PARTICLE MACE brings the same level of abstract and chaotic couch co-op to the action arcade genre.The controls and the physics revolving around your cluster of tethered space garbage really hit the nail on the head. There's a serious feeling of weight to the mace you're swinging around as you swerve to each side trying to get it's momentum going, and when you do it feels very natural. There are different ships of different speeds to accommodate each and every play style, ranging from the super slow ship with a large and effective particle mace to the extremely fast and speedy ship with a longer and harder to control mace.Getting into the groove of the game is a very zen-like experience, becoming lost in the motions of your ship weaving in and out of clusters of asteroids. The movement of your chosen ship feels incredibly fluid and responsive, giving you the edge you need to navigate through the narrowest of passages in-between asteroids and your intimidating red foes.The multiplayer co-op is where PARTICLE MACE really shines as it isn't just the simple addition of new players on the screen, but features some discoverable techniques like the combining of Maces or the revival of fallen teammates floating by helplessly which will require the full coordination of each participating player.Even in it's early stages there's already a whole slew of really great modes and options you would expect from a polished full release, including the progressive mission mode which dishes out a series of unique and increasingly harder tasks to take on  that will earn you new ships, à la Luftrausers. Although seemingly simple on the surface, PARTICLE MACE is a huge game with incredible polish and an almost infinite learning curve, making this one hell of an addictive ride to pick up and play for the shortest bursts of play to the longest couch co-op jam sessions.

												This game is more entertaining than I first thought. The missions and unlocks are motivating. The different ships (or at least some of them) have their uses depending on the situation, mission and scenario. And the soundtrack is indeed quite good, even though I generally don't like electric sounds ;-)Note: I received this game in a package with great discount. I'm not sure if it's worth 10 bucks.

												I found this game at a gaming con set up in an arcade cabinet in the indie section, and my friends and I found ourselves hooked into the night. A fantastic local multiplayer game.  Each player has a spaceship that drags weapons behind it on elastic tethers, with the goal being to fling your ""net"" into the other players.  The physics on the tethers is spot-on, and makes for frenetic couch play.  Definitely recommended!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really cool little asteroid-arcade game which is very unique. However, I bought this game while it was on sale and I don't think I would've bought it for its usual price. Is it a enjoyable and fun game? Yes.Is it worth buying? If you're just splurging on money, sure, but the novelty of the game somewhat wears off after a while and it is pretty short despite the replayability.			",69,15,1,6,6,0,7

Not sure if he can do anything about it as apparently it's up to the rights holder on Steam.**ADDITIONAL UPDATE: They've now removed the launcher.  My progress is still lost, though.

												I don't usually write reviews, but I love this game. You know how sometimes you're just looking for a good, cheap game that you can sink your teeth into right away without having to think too much about it? A game that has an interesting new mechanic and is instantly addictive? This is that game. It takes about five seconds to learn the basics, and then it grabs you--that whole whip-the-mace-at-rocks-and-ships thing.For those who don't know: Imagine chunks of space junk tethered (by bungie cords) to an agile spaceship. The trick is to, with a single thumbstick, use the ship's momentum and direction to fling those tethered chunks like a mace and pulverize asteroids and enemy ships. (Yes, there is a local, four-player muiltiplayer mode.) It's simply divine.While it is inspired by arcade classics, it instantly sets itself apart. There's a whole lot of variety here for just a few bucks. This is that game you'll play as your warm-up for a marathon session of some bigger, grander game. Only...you'll probably look up after a few hours and realize that you spent all your time flinging the PARTICLE MACE.WARNING: Like a lot of folks, I was disappointed about the lack of Steam Controller support. I'm glad I took the time to dig up my old Xbox 360 controller, but this omission is unfortunate.Still, to quote Doug McKenzie: ""...all in all, a good five dollars worth for me and my whole family.""

												Particle Mace is actually pretty hard. The physics of flinging around the ""Mace"" attached to your ship is pretty difficult. One would think that this translates well to a mouse, but it actually seems to work better with a controller. The game runs fine and the music is nice, but the difficulty will probably keep me from putting an obscene ammount of hours into it. The challenge modes are pretty fun, and the 4 player multiplayer is where this game can really shine for couch gaming.  In all honesty, the 4 player couch action is the game's saving grace. I'd personally recomend going for this on sale, and looking at it as a multiplayer game for your buds. -PR0XIDIAN			",912,138,59,85,56,7,110

But not something to go back to a lot :)The multiplayer part is also rather cool but does get boring after a while. Maybe something fun to do in a coffee break but not too much.TLDR; A fun and small game to play and I will definitively play more, but not worth the full price. Still thumbs up(Y)!

												Fluidly and beautifully smash geometry to bits with elegant physics.This game is pretty much the hidden gem in the current Indiegala Monday bundle. The game mechanics are deceptively simple: use any stick on your gampad to move your spaceship in any direction. The weights attached to the lines will then accelerate (rotate around you if you do it right) and smash things; but don't try that with your ship, because then you will be smashed. There are few different setups of spaceship mass, speeds and weight/line arrangements, and some do require different tactics. I tried this game out in local MP (it seats 4 players, though we tried it with two), and it really shines there: co-op is well done, and death match is fun, especially if you're using different ship types. I'm not certain I can say the same for the single-player ""campaign"", which comes down to doing 150 mini-""missions"" (aka achievements); consider it ""practice mode"".Immediately awesome. It's not a big game by any means, but well worth any small price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(5/5 star) I really enjoy this game.  Controls work great (xbox 360 gamepad) & responsive, great tutorial, and has a good amount of incentive to keep playing.  There are 3 levels (normal, hard, astroid) to play for your highest score, and the gameplay is fun enough to keep you trying for a little bit.  There are ships with different characteristics to unlock, which change how you might play the levels.  And what keeps me engaged are the 150 missions that vary things up to meet some objective, like kill 5 enemies within a circle around the starting point, or kill a certain number of astroids, or don't kill anything for a certain amount of time, etc.  There is a decent amount of variety to the missions, and then they increase the mission level.  This is a surprisingly competent game.  I am very happy that I gave this a shot.Plays great on my Windows 10 Alienware Alpha on my 47"" TV with an xbox360 gamepad.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								Really liking this game. Still in early access, but lots on enjoyment to be had. It fills a ""quick, easy, twin-stick-ish, unique arcade game"" hole that I had in my heart/library.Pros:-The controls are very tight and the ""mace"" responds as expected -Good variation ""ships""-Game modes are entertaining: easy, hard, asteroid field, challenges-Unlocks give you something to strive for if a new high score is not enough.  -And unlock goals are set well; high, but not too high.-Music is atmospheric and fits nicely.  -The sounds and graphics make it feel retro, but still polished.-Leaderboads makes a lot of sense-The gameplay keeps you coming back to do better / change strategies / destroy all the things. ""just one more time""-Have not tried multiplayer yet-Developers hosted a high score competition with prizes! How cool is that!-On mac so even my silly iFriends can play too.-Great pricepoint! Possible improvements:-Other game modes could be added for further variety (time attack/pacifism)-Could add some customization for difficulty/ease multipliers: set number of particles/asteroid density/enemy strength/ etc.-An ""adventure"" mode to pick up more particles/ gain shields/ pseudo bosses?-Power ups?Excited to see what is yet to come! 8/10 ",196,67,4,14,31,2,27

Arcade(Survival+Endless mode), Co-op Arcade, Deathmatch and 150 missions/Levels.This is Local Co-op up to 4 players.About the game.You play with a ship that has a wrecking ball around him. You have to move your ship in order to move the wrecking ball. You will have to kill targets with your wrecking ball by swinging it around. While the game is easy to understand with easy controls, It isn't easy to hit objects with the wrecking ball. Sometimes this could be even frustating too. But the game idea is totally there.  There are like 150 missions with each of their own objective. Like ""kill this within 5 secs"" or ""stay here for 15 secs"" and so go on.Game controls are good.Music is alright.Graphics is okay.Hitbox is perfectly accurate.There is a small tutorial.There is a difficulty settings.Local Co-op up to 4 players. (Xbox controller required)Other things.Alot of colorful objects. If it starts to hurt your eyes, then turn on the color blind mode.-------------------I Give this game a 6/10 ",469,170,6,45,49,1,62

												A fabulous game for those who love the arcade style. I have it in my ""relax"" category for when I need to start winding down for the night. It's fun, and the physics are unique. As someone who loves physics games, I couldn't resist purchasing it just to try it out. And although I got it on sale, I would purchase it at full price today if I knew it was going to be that good.If you are looking for a simple yet fun arcade game, play it. If you're looking for the ""ultimate gaming experience"", you might be looking down the wrong alley.I'll be playing this game for a long time.			",95,12,4,3,4,0,4

												I've bought it on sale and thought it will be boring, I just wanted some cards. Now I know I was wrong, because this game is pure fun! Physics in this game are incredibly good. As you can know from title, you don't deal with your opponents and asteroids with guns, but with a mace. And that's a really interesting idea, which is really good. There's so many levels and quests, that I haven't finished the game, but I'll probably do it in future. I haven't notice any bugs or errors, it's just perfectly made game! I haven't tried multiplayer mode yet, but I think you should. I really didn't know that I'll have so much fun with this type of game! I highly recommend it. Have fun with this game!P.S. I'm not a native english speaker, so I'm sorry if I made some grammatical errors.			",251,70,8,26,13,0,34

												A good casual game, but not worth the full price. Wait till it is on sale before you buyAlso the game has a terrible fps lock of about 22fps, which is awful for pc games, and with this particular title, causes very large problems every now and again because, though very rarely, the game will unlock for a micro-second, causing it to speed up, and this has caused me to crash into asteroids, and therfore fail missions quite commonly.This really needs a 60fps update in order to be properly playable on pc			",120,5,8,6,7,0,0

Review - PARTICLE MACE""I never knew how wonderful physics can be!""    PARTICLE MACE is a physics arcade game where you try to reach a specific goal/objective by controlling a ship with some particles attached to it. Basically, you try to apply your knowledge of physics to be able to manipulate and master the control of the particles. The particles can destroy your enemies and asteroids but still, your victory will still depend on the game objectives. This game also features a multiplayer mode.    Don't let the graphics deceive you. The game's flawless physics is what makes this game so good and so addicting to play. If you've got some money to spare, this game can gob up some of your idle hours. I recommend it to players who loves minigames like Beyond Gravity.Personal Rating:Gameplay: 9/10 (Replayability is totally high)Music: 8/10Story: n/aGraphics: 7/10Overall: 8/10			",99,66,2,18,11,3,15

-Quick Review-PARTICLE MACE is an indie-2d-space-ship game that plays like ""asteroids"", only instead of going pew pew, you go swish swish, you swing particles behind your ship to smash asteroids and enemy ships.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: There isn't much of a developed story, supposedly everyone is dead and now you're the only survivor in a ship trying to survive. (Good thing they let me respawn though. Because if I didn't get to respawn all hope would be lost because this game take a bit of getting used too)Gameplay: PARTICLE MACE was inspired by old classic video games, ergo it feels very much like a classic video game. While still very challenging and difficult, the game feels far more playable then classic video games because this game can actually be beat! (props to all of you classic video game deities, we all want to be like you, only with a real life too.)As I have already eluded too, you don't have laser “pew pew” weapons, instead you have pixels holding on to the back of your ship for dear life, you need to use these “particles” to smash into objects to do damage for you. As the game itself says “you use these games like a Mace” Thus the name “PARTICLE MACE”.There are a few different game modes; Missions, Asteroids, Easy, and hard. Each game mode plays a little differently.Personally I enjoyed trying to finish the Missions the most, you always have 3 different missions that you can try to accomplish in one attempt, or just get one of them and it'll shuffle to a new mission.The game mode ""Asteroids"" is what it sounds like, you just have asteroids that you're up against, however it is definitely just as tough as any of the other game modes.Easy, supposedly an “easier” arcade version of the game, quite honestly I can't tell; it's one hit and you're dead with all but one ship.Hard, supposedly a “harder” arcade version of the game, quite honestly I can't tell; it's one hit and you're dead with all but one ship.There  are also a number of ships you can unlock and play as, some move faster, some have bigger Particles dragging behind them, others have other advantages. All in all, there isn't much to say about the ships without giving away some of the few surprises within the game. In the end I found myself using only one or two of the different unlocked ships.Lastly, there's Local Co-op, I wish it was online multiplier, I have a tough enough time joining my steam friends in game (lining up my free time with someone else's) having a friend come over and play on the same machine as me... yeah no, that unfortunately will probably never happen.Achievements: There are 21 achievements on PARTICLE MACE... none of which are easily obtained. After my first play through I had a total of none of them (that's 5 hours of playing... with no achievements. Any other achiever would flinch after hearing that)There are four types of achievements in this game: Single Player, Co-op, Mastery and Grind. About 13 achievements are able to be earned on your own, 7 achievements earned in Co-op (Aye dn't haz N-E frnds, stahp mak'n meh mahke frnds), 1 achievement for doing everything, and out of those 21 achievements, at least half of those achievements require extensive grinding.Price: PARTICLE MACE is priced at $4.99 for 5 hours of entertainment out of the game. (so far, 08/03/15, I have a lot of grinding to do before I'm ready to give up.) All in all, that's a fair price. Even if you're tight on money, I always feel good about recommending indie games.Conclusion: I recommend PARTICLE MACE to gamers who enjoy playing older games, or are just looking for a change of pace. Unless you're an achievement hunter this game won't take very long to play through the missions and finish.			",141,13,3,13,8,0,23

												This is a great game. It is fun and works well with a mouse, but a controller is definitely recommended for singleplayer and required for multiplayer. There is no online multiplayer (Which is a shame) but it does have a good local multiplayer. The game also contains 150 single player missions which are fun and challenging.9/10 Would recommend (Get a controller though)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It might seem like a misnomer, yet if Particle Mace shows anything, it's that it's possible to feel totally claustrophobic in space. Yes, notwithstanding being among the evidently unending degree that is the universe, you can feel swarmed, penned in, even pursued among the stars - well, while going up against Andy Wallace's high-score chaser, that is. Here's a preoccupation where, from the word go, you get yourself completely incorporated by comets tumbling towards your position and foe make brisk to track you down and take you out, without even a weapon to shoot in fear. Besides, for the underlying few tries at any rate, you're not at risk to survive said trap for more than a couple of minutes, either. Seen beginning from the top, Particle Mace's 2D thought on space is a round of survival, with a virtual thumbstick at the base of the screen your elite effect on strategies. Dealing with your ship around an encased piece of space, the fundamental way you can to shield yourself is to utilize the trails of refuse added to the back of your craft that the redirection urges you to use like a mace, swinging around to clear your surroundings. Anything your stopgap mace scopes is either annihilated (by virtue of enemy water crafts) or if nothing else diminished in size, with centers amassed along these lines. You then have a short window of time in which to build up a multiplier, with any additional boats you take out in progression passing on results of 10 centers when hung together. What makes Particle Mace especially fascinating is this separation between the redirection's setting and reality of its play. The preoccupation's instructional practice overemphasizes your disconnection: you're the last surviving pontoon in the universe, and you don't have anything to your name other than the fuel in your tank. Regardless, the insignificant method for the play space and the growing number of articles in your direction suggests that you're something other than alone – while your first instinct may be to keep up a vital separation from all your beforehand specified adversaries, really survival infers ducking and diving between said segments remembering the true objective to forgo them. Indeed, Particle Mace is a session of smoothness. When you build up a musicality, it quickly ends up being evident that you have to voyage particularly close to the contort in order to survive. A couple of foes, for instance, will fly around space in much an indistinct route from you, with their way especially easy to track. Others, regardless, are essentially more unconventional, shooting or pivoting space in impacts. Everything infers that being bashful will, after a hidden few butchers, achieve nothing for you, and to string together the kind of top scores required to open better ships for later entertainments, you have to fly straight up to your rivals and take them out just before they do similarly to you. It's the time when you start hanging together these multipliers that Atom Mace really finds its feet and play gets especially hurried, however if you support much all the more a test, the preoccupation's fundamental objective mode sees you have to open three achievements in one burst of play. Killing a set number of enemies in just a couple of minutes, or take out adversary especially all while endeavoring to hit distinctive destinations meanwhile gives Atom Mace's focal objective mode an extra edge and, in light of current circumstances, serves as an accommodating mentor for the major mode, giving you allow to do the kind of betrays you may shy a long way from in the essential mode, yet have the sureness to come back to in the wake of acing them going up against the preoccupation's missions. Also, furthermore an allow to have a touch of fun, and – with everything taken into account – Atom Mace shies a long way from putting fun in advance. It really doesn't have any kind of effect about the setting, nor does the setting of the waste trails you use to monitor yourself have a critical impact, either. What it is, that as it might, is put an absolutely one of a kind transform on what could have easily transformed into a standard, best down space shooter. Particle Mace, rather, feels absolutely new paying little heed to its retro stylings and passes on the kind of experience perfect for adaptable – eat measured bits of play faultless eatable in an additional couple of minutes, yet adequately content on offer for the people who support to some degree more than a snack, too. Space, then, may not be completely as diminish and unfilled as we want to think it is – it may actually be coordinating with life vivacious to take an interest in battle - yet if Atom Mace is anything to cruise by, it's little consider everyone on earth rushes to get up there. Putting another bend on the space shooter, Atom Mace is hurried to its inside, blaming you for fighting off gatherings of enemies without even a slug to fire with all due regard. Regardless, its disconnected mighty style isolates it from whatever is left of the class and the troubles stuffed inside guarantee it'll stay centered home screen for a long time to come.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time.
