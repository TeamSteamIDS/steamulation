Early Access Review
								I was going to write up an elegant summary of the game but honestly it doesn't need it. The game is easily the best golf sim I've played. The fact it has an unblievable course creator just puts it over the top. It's intuitive, fun and beautiful. You can play your course as your build it to ensure its exactly what you wanted. From placing objects such as buildings, trees, signs to sculpting a simple sand trap, you'll be in love with the ease at which it's all done.Ontop of that the game is gorgeous to look at, runs great and simply the best representation of golf you can find on PC. With an interesting multiplayer aspect you can challenge your friends or take on their ghost ball of their best score. So if you like golf, or golf creation and horribly written reviews, you should get this game.			",94,13,3,14,19,1,21

Early Access Review
								From what I have played so far, this might be one of the best golf games ever made and it is nice to finally see a game like this on Steam.The golf course creation tool is amazing.  You are able to create and customize your own golf course - It can be fully randomly generated or you can hand craft all of the holes, bunkers, trees, hills, anything you could think of, and you can share it to the public.As it is currently Early Access some game modes are not available as of yet, such as Tour's and Tournaments (These have a coming soon sign).  Stat tracking is also on the way.As far as I can see, there is no online multiplayer, however you do get to play against other players ghosts and The Golf Club supports local Multiplayer.Graphics wise - Very good, very nice looking game.Audio is also nice and the commentary that is in the game is a little different from games such as EA's  Tiger Woods games, and that is a nice change.

												Usually when I look at a game, if it has mixed or below reviews I steer clear.  Luckily I got The Golf Club before it got too negative, because I personally have never had any issues with the performance of the game.  I don't doubt those who say they have, but I have had nothing but fun playing this game.On the hardware side, my PC has an i5, and a GTX760, and the game runs very smoothly, with the exception of the rare course with massive amounts of trees.  As far as content, well, you play golf.  Some people appear unhappy that there is no career mode, and while that would be cool, it wasn't part of the game I bought, and my family enjoys just sitting down for a round of golf when we get together.  I guess a lot of people are looking for a replacement for their previous favorite golf sims, and they find The Golf Club lacking, but if all you want is to play a round of golf when you feel like a round of golf, then this fits the bill nicely.

												What an utter disappointment for a game with so much potential and practically zero competition on the PC market. Very limited PC graphics optimization and horrible performance issues prevent me from recommending this game in its current state. With wonky putting, an unreliable swing mechanic, and lackluster ball physics (seriously the same bounce on every terrain except sand), you'd best save your money until this is patched.On the plus side the sound design is top notch and the course creator is a great feature, however its certainly not enough to justify buying a game that feels like its still in beta.

												I have never played a game as much as I have with The Golf Club. The Greg Norman Course designer is incredibly powerful, easy to use, and will have you creating fantastic courses in no time. The actual golf is great, relying on skill and not special pants you can buy that help you hit it 20 yards further. The career mode in the game is the only downside of the game, but if you head on over to TGCTours.com, you can play a REAL career mode with real players (check it out)!The community on the HB Forums and TGCTours.com is incredibly active, helpful and fun, which further makes this game a complete joy to play. HB Studios is always making tweaks, and adding new features and themes for courses to help improve the game even more.100% recommended to any golf fans and aspiring course designers.

												I've been waiting for a decent PC golf game since TW08.  This is almost that game.  Pros: Beautiful scenery, fairly natural swing control, solid in-game physics, wide variety of available courses, and a course editor that is a lot of fun.  Cons: Charging extra for a Season (Career) Mode is lame at best, any joy created by Season Mode is removed by fact that the software engineers chose to cheat the game horribly so their software would not ""lose"" - no regional Pro-Am EVER had a an entire top 10 at -11 in a single 18 hole round! Makes it tough to care about playing through it.  Overall, I would give the game as it stands right now, 3/6/16, a B-.  I will continue to play the game in other modes, but I am done with Seasons until the programmers stop cheating.  Save yourself $9.99 and skip skip it.added 3/7/16: Apparently the last update weighted all AI scores in all single player competitive events to the realm of absolutely stupid.  The last 18 hole event I managed to finish had the ENTIRE TOP 30 IN THE LOW 50s!  Until it is fixed, the only single player mode worth playing is single course, NO AI.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Update to the Updates: As of May 2015 they have made it so that in order to access some of features you have to buy a ""DLC"" which gives you access to the season pass features. So those of us that thought we spend $20 on a golf game just found out that we have to spend more money to get the other half of the game. On top of which the game still has a lot of development left despite the current release status. I felt this information was foremost to what I had to say about the game play that I experienced.Don't get me wrong. With the demise of the Tiger Woods Golf franchise us fairway junkies have been waiting for a game to come along and give us our knee pant, 9 iron fix. This game will be that, one day. Right now the game is being updated side by side with the console build of the game. Very little effort has been put into the controls for mouse users. So you either need to play with a Xbox controller for the PC or struggle to figure out the who what where when and why of how the game registers your mouse movement. There seems to be no ability to control roughly how hard you whack the ball, I still haven't seen much influence from using the fade and draw features. It makes it hard to not want to break your digital club around the electronic trees surounding you on the course. That all being said the game is still in early stages, one day the game might be the next great golf game for both PC and console. One day. Right now they are putting too much into social features like friends lists and competative play, meanwhile very little into the ability to teach players how to use their control systems to get precise shots. I'm no stranger to golf games but I'm having a very hard time being consistant with this game.Edit/Update: I've had the chance to play a few rounds with an XBox controller, and I've found the controls equally as hard to master. I think the problem still lies in not having a meter system either in game or at least as part of a learning feature that help you adjust to the control scheme.As for the rest of the game. A lot has been put into implementing the social features. The game has single, tournament and tour features. I really like the choice of play variety. However unless you happen to bring 3 other golfers in your bag at the bottom with the loose tees good luck. There is no match making feature that I've come across. So if you don't have other players to play with you wind up being matched with imaginary ghost players who represent some of the best players that have played that course. Talk about frustration. As I have said the controls will drive you batty, but it's worse when an imaginary player with a -7 is driving them right to the green, taunting you while you try to work your way out of the sand. The feature was so annoying the do now have a way to turn it off. So obviously this game does want to promote social play. But for those of us who don't have golf loving gaming buddies it would be nice to have a match feature to meet up with other single players for some rounds. I have not used the course making feature, but I've read that it too can be very difficult to use. However there are many well made player designed courses, that is a great feature of the game.While they are constantly improving the social features of the game, the frustration of the controls combined with the under developed ability to actually use the full social interface make all the implemented features still seem far off. I will revisit this game soon hopefuly after some more updates to see what they have done.February 2015 update: I finally uninstalled the game. The last updates have seemed to revert the controls back to being wonky and unpredictable. Which is a shame because right before that I was finally have to have a full round with a negative score. The controls seemed to be getting better. That has seemed to change. I'll check back maybe in the spring or summer to see if after a few more updates if the game has made any improvements.

												First off, while this is marked as a recommended title, there are issues to be aware of.This game is fun, but it's missing some key elements that sports type games need to be an overall good experience. There is nothing in the way of a practice mode, or even a basic tutorial. You're thrust into the game, and left to figure out how to play on your own. I don't understand why there was such an oversight in this design, and the developers even acknowledge the lack of a practice/tutorial mode in a video on their own page. That being said, it is great fun. The courses, while not real world copies, are challenging, and quite rewarding to those that take risks in their shots. The game mechanics are good, and the game is engrossing enough to have you looking for you club, when you've missed a shot by inches, and decide to throw it. The bad is this. I felt like I've played this game before, at least, I've played PGA Golf Games before, but they felt like there was more to it. This feels less than, because it's more simulator, and less casual. Putting is challenging, and there aren't 15 different types of overlays setup for you to use. Instead you get a grid, and a camera you can move. It feels basic, but it's more challenging in the end. If that is what the devs were going for, which I believe they were, then they hit the mark. This is not a Tiger Woods game, this is a Golf Simulator, rage included at no extra charge. p.s. please add some sort of practice or tutorial modes. That's really a rookie mistake.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't get too wound up about my golf game, and it's a good thing I don't. Otherwise, long ago I would have thrown myself in the nearest water hazard along with my clubs. Enjoying a nice day on a gorgeous course is enough. The Golf Club captures this essence in both the challenge of perfecting your swing and the pride of being able to create your own gorgeous courses. But, is that beauty enough?The game's course creation tools are impressive in their ability to not only let you build detailed courses, but the scalability of the tools themselves. You can apply some macro-levels rules to shape your course with simple min/max sliders – like if you want your course as a whole to be hilly or have lots of water – or dive into placing individual trees, objects, and even whales. The menu presentation is straightforward, but there are times like placing water, for instance, where the macro and micro tools can cause confusion on how to exactly get what you want. Regardless, the game puts a lot of power in your hands, and with a little tinkering you soon learn how to efficiently work with the tools and start making some sweet courses.I was really impressed with the naturally adaptability of your holes in the broader context of the world's environment. Moving a hole en masse, rearranging holes' order, adding/subtracting holes, and even switching out the overall theme of the environment (you can choose from desert, autumn/forest, rural, alpine, and the wild Scotland-like links terrain) is well done.You can also dive in and playtest your hole at any time; dropping your ball in a specific location or playing the whole thing. Finding and playing other people's creations is easy as well, and you can use them to put together your own tour of courses.The golf gameplay itself is challenging and satisfying. The right analog swing requires precision, especially when applying draw or fade, and a minimal pre-swing HUD is hard at first. Gauging your swing power while putting, in particular, takes getting used to, but it won't take long to develop a rhythm and feel to your swing.As well-crafted as the game is, it's missing a sense of progression that drives you forward. While creating the course of your dreams (or someone else's nightmares) feels good, I missed a larger structure. Visual or physical golfer upgrades, an overarching rewards system tied to your stats, or even a career shell are missing and there's lost momentum within the game because of it. Seeing what kinds of courses I and others could come up with and the challenges therein is motivating, but the sustenance it provides is impermanent.The Golf Club delivers as a course creator, and it's no slouch swinging the clubs, either. What's missing is the personality: the larger career structure and personal investment in your avatar to spur players on and elevate the experience from a nice set of features to the complete package   9/10Appsy doodles			",50,0,4,4,1,0,7

												I think if you want a Golf simulator, and have the patience to learn the mechanics of this game and how they work, you will love it.   Folks that are looking for an arcade golf game, probably won't like it, and will quit before they give it a chance.Personally I really like the game.  Once you get used to the controls, it ""feels"" like you really are playing golf.  You have to concentrate on each shot, and not every shot is perfect, some are really bad, sometimes you hit it perfect...but thats how it is when you really play.   The point is, the feeling you get with the controller, is about like the feeling you would have really swinging the club, from the mental point of view.I'm not sure of the specs of the reviews I see that say the game is not optimized or runs slow.  It runs perfectly fine on my machine  and the graphics look beautiful.  Multiplayer works great also, a friend and I play together and take turns and it is quite fun.The only cons I have is that there is no tutorial or practice area that I could find.  It would be nice if they at least had a tutorial in game describing the controls, and a driving range that you could click on and practice swings.   I think I eventually found this info on their website, but it was hard to find.   Also, a bit of advice, if you are using a controller, make sure you have an Xbox based one, not the older D based (Sony) kind.Final verdict in a nutshell - GREAT game, very much worth it, IF you put the time in to learn it properly.

												This game is turning into a solid golf game, the graphics are great to look at and the gameplay is getting there IMO. The main selling point of this game for me is the GNCD, the course designer. I have spent many hours on this and once you get the hang of it, your only limited by your imagination.This is a worthy successor to the EA TW series and plays a lot like it too, well if you consider that most of the people that worked on that game are the ones that developed TGC. The good thing about this game is the fact that the developers are still working on it and fixing bugs and adding stuff to it all the time, once it’s finished then this will be a solid and enjoyable title for everyone to play. The only real problem with this game for me is the graphics issue if you own an AMD Radeon card, especially the newer models, but I think this is more to do with the Unity engine than anything else, as playing this game with an Nvidia card seems less problematic and appears to run better. Although this game has been developed for the PC it still very much feels like a port, as its main focus IMO is for the console market, after all that’s where the money is.Anyway, if you’re in any doubt about buying this game, then I would recommend you do, especially if you like golf and have been looking for a worthy successor to EA TW series. There are also more updates coming soon, and with the number of courses made by the community, then its longevity is assured. It’s not quite the golf sim this has been hailed to be, as that title I think belongs to another game currently in development.Anyway this is money well spent on.Update: I can't believe that this game has now been out for over 20 months, it has had a lot of fixes applied to it and it certainly has improved since its early access days. Graphics wise this game is great to look at and I can’t fault it on that front, however the gameplay is a lot easier than it used to be IMO, it’s easier to hit straighter shots and plays more like an arcade game rather than an actual golf sim, even with all the aid’s turned off. This game still suffers with issues, originally with AMD cards and then with Nvidia cards, although fixes have been applied to fix the Nvidia issues, I wish the same could be said for AMD users, anyway putting those glitches aside, this is still a great game and I would still rate this up there with the likes of EA TW series. The games real selling point for me has been and will always be the Greg Normal Course Designer and the thousands of community designed courses out there, some of course (no pun intended) better than others. And the great thing about it is that they are all free to play, let’s hope that this stays that way. Player customisation has been cranked up and the variety of shirts and trousers available to dress your player up has increased, but I would like to see more with also some community made ones thrown in too. The selection of golf clubs has not changed and I believe that this is something that could certainly be improved along with the option to hit shots with more back spin etc.If your looking for a game to play against AI, then you'll be dissapointed, although you can play against the ""ghost"" of other players who have played the courses, whoch is better than nothing I guess. This game does not have crowds, as it was only ever inteneded to be a week-end golfer type of game and not a full blown EA-TW clone as it does not have the PGA logo or backing.This game has only had one DLC to date, which the community was in arms about, but IMO you don't have to buy it, it wasn't like the game was unplayable without it.@King Kyne, for a while I did feel this was a good Sim game, but then I started to play PG and somehow the gameplay in that was a lot harder and felt more realistic IMO. TGC feels a lot more arcade-ish, and since the updates, hitting the ball straight has become a lot easier. The game feels like its holding your hand and not letting you make mistakes too much, it almost feels like its restricting you. I don't associate a SIM game with something difficult, far from it, a SIM should allow you to do your own thing, it then becomes as individual as you. I have played PG for a while now, and since they introduced the horizontal swing mechanics, I personally feel that the game has improved in my estimation, not because it’s become harder, but I can now shape the flight of the ball better, if only it was that easy in real life! The reason the mechanics in PG works for me is that there is an option to create a draw or a fade, make the ball go higher or lower, but it still depends on how you “swing” the club, so it’s down to the player’s skill rather than the settings that you dial up. Please don’t get me wrong TGC is a great game, but it feels like something that you could pick up straight away, while PG is something else and needs practice if you want to get better at it.I guess that’s my definition of a SIM, it needs to feel natural and with enough practice you start to reap the benefits for all that hard work you’ve put in.I play with all the aids turned off in both games, and PG still feels more realistic IMO sorry to say.

												Recommended. Very fun game, and is fun to sit back and relax. Missing some of the 'fun' little additions like extra distance, changing spin while in air, etc. but doesn't really detract.My original review had some comments about the putting being awful with a mouse. The developer ACTUALLY LISTENED and linked me to a forum post detailing mouse DPI and sensitivity. After taking recommendations from there, putting is MUCH better and MUCH more intuitive.Great game, and one of the few times where the developer is actually involved and helpful.

												The best money I've ever spent.  I own this game on multiple platforms and have put more time into it than anything else in my lifetime. Sad? Yes,  but true.  The course designer is an incredible feature and worth the price of admission (and then some).  The gameplay is also terrific and haven't grown tired of it in year plus of playing everyday.Are there problems?  Sure, but nothing game breaking.  The developers are uniquely involved and responsive to the community so I'm certain it will continue to improve.  The amount of free updates is mind boggling.  I cant wait to see what the future holds.I know nothing about computers but took the time to learn evrything I could and spent every penny I had to build a PC just to play this game.

												When I bought this game, their FAQ said they were still considering incorporating a 3-click shot meter, which I assumed would be optional.  I understood they wanted a 'realistic' mechanism to focus on the 'feel' of golf, but I hoped, because of their FAQ, that they would add the 3-click shot meter for those people who preferred a lighter fun vs super serious.  Eventually they dug their feet in the ground and decided they wanted 'realism,' which completely killed my desire to play the game.  While it seems their mechanism for a console game controller works okay, their mouse and keyboard mechanism is too frustrating and imprecise to be fun.  At least for me (some may disagree).Consequentially, I felt like I had wasted my money, which inspired this less than positive review.  Alternatively, if Steam allowed (easier) refunds, I would have done so, and would not have been as frustrated, and would have just waited for a golf game that is more accommodating to us 'less-serious' golfers.

								An excellent golf game, even at early access version 0.1.The course editor is fully available, even though it's quite difficult to actually play your own course right now.Overall an excellent golf videogame, as it is right now, it's a fully featured, complete game.

												My favourite ever golf game , I had this on the PS4 and this plays identical on steam , I have read angry comments about poor controls but using an Xbox 360 controller , it plays the same as the PS4. Nowhere near as easy as the tiger woods series but I always found shooting -20 a round quite boring , this can be tough with narrow fairways on some courses but has great stats showing your best scores etc versus your friends , I cannot rate this game highly enough.

												Great golf sim with a few quirks.I love this game - play it several times a week with my Dad. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a good solid golf game, but it's certainly not perfect. Probably easiest to sum up with a list of pros and cons:ProsThe core of the game is rock solid and realistic. The feel of the swing, the look of the courses, the physics, and the action of the ball are all great. Fantastic course editor - best I've ever seen in a golf game. You can play courses created by other palyers or generate a fresh new course with just a few clicks. You'll certainly never run out of courses to play. Very satisfying when you put in a good round because you know you earned it. :)Skill is not stat based. If your get better at the game it's because you've learned to play better.Devs are still improving the game. I've been playing since the first day of Early Access and the Devs have been communicating and responding - while still sticking to their gameplan. They haven't fixed all the quirks, but the game has seen steady improvements over the months.ConsSome machines might struggle with the graphics. Seems to recquire more CPU/GPU power than you might think. Only a few graphics settings to adjust.The swing controls can be hard to learn. I love the controls (I use xbox 360 controller) but some people seem to get frustrated. No option for the old 'three-click' method that is popular in other games. I think this is part of the 'level playing field' that the devs are shooting for. They have worked hard to make the competition skill-based and fair.The interface is sometimes clunky. All the info and controls are there, but sometimes they are not intuitive.  Took me a long time to figure out what the two different distances on the putting green were (one is distance to the cup, and the other is the distance to your aiming marker). I still can't figure out how to properly show an instant replay. :)No career mode or similar extra features. The Tiger Woods games were full of all sorts of extras and some people might expect them here. Presentation is somewhat sparse. The voicover/commenter is well done, but there is very little 'juice' or graphical embellishments to spice things up.For me the pros definitely outweigh the cons.

												Well now its been released i can say its not worth the money, it wasnt ready for release so god knows why they rushed it out, its not bad so to speak but it certainly isnt as good as it should of been, it has performance issues and lacks career mode, while live multiplayer is a chore. The graphics are nothing groundbreaking and gameplay offers nothing new, it may well get called the best PC golf game by some, but thats by default as its the only one right now, unless you count WGT. Dont buy it yet would be my summary.			",234,20,22,28,50,4,55

												This is an amazing golf game, anyone who is into golf knows that there are not many good golf games for PC, actually the last decent one was Tiger Woods 2008 which was many years ago! The golf club feels like a modern updated version of the best golf game ever made (PGA 2000 by Sierra) without the tri-click option. Also the devs are still improving it and listening to people in the forums which is worth a lot these days. Highly recommended for all you golf freaks out there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Golf Club is a great golf game that has the best putting of any golf game I've ever played - once you understand it!  The graphics are great and with new themes being released it's only getting better.  There's no reason to not try it if you like golf - it's definitely more on the sim side than arcarde at this point which is pefectly fine by me.  For those looking for a bit more (career) come visit us at www.tgctours.com and enjoy an enhanced experience with The Golf Club.			",31,2,2,1,3,0,3

												Seems all my game reviews were removed so heres another try...The Golf Club is  primarily a golf simulator with an outstanding and easy to use course creator.While it lacks a conventional career mode and officially licenced courses, the high quality of many user created courses and competitive play via tournaments that mimic the pro circuit from the dedicated folks at tgctours.com , more than makes up for it.The game is still being updated even though it has been out of early access for some time now. All but one of the updates are free and add value to what is already a great game.The Devs since day one of EA have always been involved with the community and continue to listen to feedback from players.Highly recommended for the golf enthusiast or those with a creative flair.

												The graphics are nice, but this just isn't a good golf game compared to other available PC golf games (such as Customplay 2010 or Hank Haney's World Golf- which both use the same basic golf engine and both having comparable realism to The Golf Club).  Too much is missing in terms of gameplay and game types (there are no skins or stableford games), and overall this feels like a rushed console port.  The mouse swing never feels right, and is extremely unforgiving.   While the random course generator is a nice feature, the editor itself is tedious to use and not as powerful as the editors featured in other golf games (such as the Links or Jack Nicklaus series).  Do yourself a favor and avoid purchasing this game. ",51,7,0,5,21,0,26

Early Access Review
								Looks good and plays good.It's not the easiest of golf games (I've probably only managed 1 under par score in 8+ hours) but I'd rather it be that way. If I found it too easy I'd probably get a bit bored of it.The course creator is fantastic and so easy to use.In all the time I've played so far I think I've only played a couple of the developers courses twice, everything else I've just had one round on. There's so many courses to choose from, you'll always be able to find something new to play.Highly recommended if you like golf games (and it's still in Early Access with more stuff to come).

Early Access Review
								I have purchased only a few titles through Steam's Early Access.  There is a trust factor that you hope the developer upholds.  Assetto Corsa, Planetary Annihilation, and now The Golf Club (TGC) have formed an elite level of Early Access titles.  These games exemplify building a customer-developer relationship founded on trust.  The quality that is already built into TGC has me feeling satisfied, and VERY excited for the future of the product.  I am amazed at the depth of challenge.  Right when I thought that I ""got it"", I played Coronaca against some ghosts, and the greens positively whipped me (not to mention the devilishly placed fairway bunkers!!).  This game has so much potential. I can't wait for tournaments!  Building in a course designer from the start was pure genius.  You have instilled a sense of value for me.  What I really want to compliment are the design decisions.  You are making really smart moves.  The ghost method of multiplayer suits me very well.  I don't have to wait for others, worry about lag/disconnects, or even if I personally run out of free time.  The swing method is awesome.  I love that it is based on the character model swinging, not some power meter.  It really makes the game a challenge and requires that I keep my head in it.  Once I start to get lazy, there goes a slice into the woods!  There are subtleties that I love too, such as you never cut off the guy doing the voice over.  Even if I quickly move through the scorecard to the next hole, he finishes what he is saying.  I like that.  It feels polished.Thank you HB for getting me excited about a PC golf game again, and living up to expectations.  Job well done!  I'll happily continue to be a part of The Golf Club.

However it is a solid golf game that is actually quite good fun.  If you just want a casual sports game or like golf in general, this will be great.			",706,228,31,69,147,11,98

												This is a great golf game. There are many golf games out there, however they lack in the PC world. The overall feel of this game -- as far as the gameplay and layout of the game goes -- is really quite astonishing. Unlike a lot of games, with this game you have to take everything into account from the wind, speed of the fairways/greens, slope of the holes, etc. It really is a very neurotic game and you have to be smart how you play it. On a difficulty perspective, this game is very challenging. It takes lots of practice on each course to master it. It's almost like actually golfing where you have to take notes, make adjustments, and eat it when you fail. I highly recommend getting this game if you're an avid golf fan like I am.

												I've had my eye on this game for quite some time. I picked it up during a sale recently and do not regret it at all.I'm a former Links player and I've been looking for a simliar experience for quite some time. This game captures that experience. I'm not a big fan of the Tiger Woods gaming experience. The RPG elements and monetization scheme is just not for me.This game is about skill and consistency. There is a learning curve. You'll be frustrated and challenged. There is no magic win button/skill/purchase. There is just you and your skill. As it should be. Trust me, I'm right up against that learning curve with only a few hours in. Out of the gate, this game feels good. Tons of potential here.There are pretty consistent updates to the game and content additions. The community is growing and getting stronger. Support this game if you are a fan of games of skill, rather than a vapid pay to win environment.It isn't without a few bugaboos. Nothing has been a show stopper, up to this point.On thing that I wish they would add is some sort of visual indicator of your swing. ",40,4,1,4,8,0,9

												There is a huge lack of golf sims out there - remember Microsoft Golf, Arnold Palmer Links, and of course Tiger Woods? Now there are basically The Golf Club and WGT. And between the two, I'll take The Golf Club any day.The graphics are good - I won't say GREAT - and the sounds/speech is good (although the commentator gets a bit annoying after a bit). Mechanics are solid, certainly better than the ridiculous 2 click meter used in WGT. If you like real swing method using your mouse, rather than clicking on a meter, TGC is for you. It doesn't quite rise to the level of the swing meter on Tiger Woods - which I consider to be the best golf game ever - but it's not too far off. All in all, you can play 18 (or 9) holes and have a darned enjoyable time; for true golf enthusiasts, this is probably as close to the real thing as you can get without lugging your clubs out to the local links.A few negatives: the match-making. NOT easy to jump into a multi-player game against real people. The menus are not very easy to navigate, despite their initial appearance with large labelled icons. You have to click and click and click to find a course to play, set up the paramaters and match type and difficulty, then when trying to find opponents to play TGC will automatically locate ""players"" and fill your roster to the number you have selected (2, 3, 4, etc). The only problem - no guarantee you will actually get REAL players. Once the round starts, most of the time you find yourself playing ""Ghosts"" of the actual players. I.e., they are not logged in, but TGC selected them based on their skill levels, rating on the course you are playing, etc - and popped their ""ghosts"" into the game with you. Huh??? So, 8 times out of 10, you will find yourself playing against basically 2 or 3 other computer AI players. Needless to say, not a very social occasion. Try chatting with them. The ONLY way you can play against other REAL live people is if you manually select someone you have ""Friended"" and who you KNOW is in the game. If they aren't in the game, and you locate them by UserName, you will just get their ""ghost"" again. You CANNOT just randomly play games against other live players. This is one of the biggest faults in this game to me.I do find the game fun, but there is .... something... missing. Hard to put a finger on it. Individually, all the components of a great golf game are there. But put together, it falls a bit short, and I wish I could describe specifically what that is. Difficulty-wise, it IS hard to get below par (and I've played a ton of golf games for a lot of years, and consider myself pretty darn good). Putting especially is a pain in the butt. There is NO power meter. On ANY swing. So you have no real idea how hard you are swinging.  There is NO swing meter, so you have NO idea how far your backswing is. There are NO bars period. You just totally wing it. Most of the time just pulling all the way back on the mouse for a full swing works, but what about that sand wedge just off the green? It says it is 40 ft from the pin, and your wedge has a maximum distance of 50 ft, so you don't want to do a full swing - but how do you judge what the right backswing is? 80%, you think? OK - so how do you swing the club back around 80%? No meter=no way of knowing how far back you are swinging your club. Again - you just wing it, and 9 times out of 10 you will wind up doing a full swing even though you didn't want to. Or you overcompensate, and wind up doing a little 20% chip that sends the ball 2 feet. VERY annoying. I read all of the other reviews saying they LOVE this aspect, but they are ""purists"" who think that any kind of power or swing meter is ""cheating."" Whatever. If I want that level of realism, I'll go play real golf at the local course. For a game - I want at least some idea of how hard I am ""swinging"" my ""club.""All in all, I give this a thumbs-up, but to be honest I have stopped playing it very much due to the swing mechanics described above. If they ever add a power/backswing meter, and if they make it so you can actually play REAL LIVE people randomly -  I will be reinvigorated to play, guarantee it. In the meantime, if you love golf and virtual golf games, you will definitely enjoy this game, even though it may not rise to the top of your ""Favorite golf game"" list.			",4,1,4,2,28,0,3

												tl;dr: if you're a casual golf game fan, The Golf Club is awesome. I can't speak for whether or not it will satisfy hardcore fans, because I'm not one.So, I've been looking for a good PC golf game for a while. I'm not a golfer in real life, nor am I a particularly hardcore fan of the genre. I just played Tiger Woods '06/'07 on X-Box 360 a while ago, thought they were fun, and have been looking for something similar. I stayed away from The Golf Club while it was in Early Access because, well, I don't do Early Access. And I kinda forgot about it for a while.A few days ago, Jack Nicklaus' Perfect Golf came out, and I thought ""Hey, maybe this will be my cup of tea!""I honestly can't even tell you if it's my cup of tea or not, because Perfect Golf's UI/UX is absolutely atrocious. After 20 frustrating minutes of fighting against the game just to try and learn the basics, I uninstalled it and got a refund. Maybe there is a good golf game in there, I don't know, but I should not have to untangle a convoluted mess just to understand the basics of the game.Then I saw the Golf Club was out of Early Access, and I grabbed it. Within THREE MINUTES, I had a handle on the game.Now again, I'm not a hardcore golf guy, so maybe there's a bunch of depth to this game that I'm missing. There probably is. I can't tell you the difference between a chip and a pitch, and I can't remember which side is draw and which side is fade, and I've never adjusted the point of impact on the ball. All of that stuff exists in The Golf Club, so I assume I still have a long way to go to mastering it. But unlike Perfect Golf, the basics here are simple and intuitive. Everything about the controls, the menus, the UI/UX experience, makes sense. If you put a controller in my hand and tell me to play a game I've never played before, and I've got the basics down in three minutes? You have done something very, very right.

												I cannot say how much I am disappointed in this game. The only positive thing I can say is that the graphics look great. Everything about game play is ridiculous. The physics must be a simulation from a different planet. Hit the club twice the same way and the ball may travel 20 feet or 30 yards. The is no consistency at all. I wish I could get my money back for this turd but Im sure thats about as likely and hitting a hole in one.			",19,0,0,7,1,0,1

Great for both the casual player as well as anyone who wants to get competitive with it (see TGC Tours)!  The entertainment value of this game is off the charts, if you're a golf fan you'd be doing yourself a disservice to not pick up this steal of a deal!!

												The Golf Club is a fantastic game!  HB Studios has nailed down a solid simulation. What really brings out the glory of this title is the Greg Norman Course Design feature.  Creating your own courses is quite enjoyable.  Whether its for yourself with a local track, or its for the masses as a famous track or just something strait from your imagination.The GNCD offers many different themes to choose from when starting out your course, and they keep adding new themes in on a regular basis, along with sew tools and ""stuff"" to use while creating your magic.  The good news here is,  the themes just keep getting better and better than the last, it seems the dev team is really taking note on the feedback from the community on what people want and like.Overall, I have been playing since day 1 of open beta, and after 1500 hours of game play time, I still enjoy and look forward to playing TGC.  I really hope they do a TGC 2 down the line.			",10,0,2,0,3,0,0

Early Access Review
								Very unpolished at this stage. My main interest and the reason I bought this was for the course designer. I wanted to create a replica of my home course but oh dear oh dear.. what a mess. The whole game was clearly created for the console community and it shows, painfully. The facilty to edit is very poor indeed. You get to go through set options but you cannot start from scratch with a grass field and do one hole after the other which to me is the whole point of a course designer. I know this is early access but I still feel robbed. Unless the whole interface is going to become more ""pc"" friendly and the designer does eventually allow you to place fairways and holes exactly where you want them and not in a set, pre-determined manner I can honestly say I will regret buying this.As always with these alpha, beta, early access games take my advice and DONT BUY UNTIL IT ACTUALLY RELEASES AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WILL BE GETTING.

												The Golf Club is by far the best game I've ever played.    The gameplay,   and the course creator will keep this game growing for years to come.   There are some incredible course designers that put courses out on a daily basis so the replay value here is crazy good.    The devs are quick to fix things and add new features but they're a small team so you have to be patient.     The game has grown leaps and bounds within the last year and it's light years better than some of the current competiton in my opinion.A few cons is that they really need to work on the social aspect of the game so that it's easier to find multiplayer games.  They are lacking typical gamemodes that you expect to see and they don't and will never have a conventional lobby.   They basically just have you send an invite to a friend to join you a the course but only half the time it works.  You are constantly having to kick your friend from the game and re add him to just see him play.    Like I said,  it's still the best game I've played but the multi player taking a backseat to some of the other features has always left me scratching my head..The course creator is revolutionairy,  it's just flat out amazing.   This game appeals more to the guy that wants a relaxing real round of golf without all the EA sports glitz and glamour.   This game can be played with a controller,  PS4 is what I use..  I own the game on my ps4 and PC,  and I get all the updates on my PC as soon as they're ready which is awesome.  Honestly though,  the game plays just as well on the ps4.  It seems to me that they've taken lots of time to optizimze it for the consoles and I can certainly undertand why considering that is the majority of their audience.I give this game maximum stars, even with it's issues...   Also,  if you play the a course insipred by the ""Delta Theme""   I was the guy that named that theme!!!  I won a ""name that theme""  competition and the boys from HBS sent me some cool swagg for my winning submission.One of the big fish up at the golf club name is Anthony Kyne,  and he is a very likable chap,  who does live streams often where he takes questions from us mere mortals...  I have grown fond of Anthony over the last year and have his face tattooted on my buttocks ;) ",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

												The game garners much hate for not having the old links 386 styled 3 click swing. They opt instead to go for a meterless true motion swing that ends up being played best from a gamepad then a keyboard and mouse, if this bothers you then perhaps its not quite the golf game your looking for.I still play and enjoy the port of Golden Tee golf on the PC and for years there was no real suitable replacement and while there is no ""replacement"" for GTgolf, I do find this game just as enjoyable but for some very different reasons. The Golf Club comes into its own for the way it deals with sloping surfaces and also implements probrably the greatest putting grid known to man. It also happens to have some great 2015 graphics and where it lacks in flair it more then makes up for it with a very solid golf simulation.While it drops the ball in adding some excitement via sound effects and lacks more engaging commentary, it says nothing about the simulation beneath it, which is crisp. The game itself does require some beefy hardware to get medium + settings at 1080p. I can recommend this game to any Golf fan but keep in mind to get the best swings control and results you should get your settings to allow 60 frames per second when playing.Played onAvg FPS: 50-70Settings: Medium preset from launcher config with res @ 1920x1080i5 2500k @ 4.0GHzR9 270X 2GB16GB 1600MHz DDR3Pros+ Great looking (even on medium)+ Awesome course designer and courses+ Less ability for people to ""calculate"" their swing (aka cheating with math)Cons- Sound design is stale (some golf claps and some flair would be nice)- Difficult to play for mouse/kb- Perhaps boring to more casual golf fans that like arcade golf more- System requirements are quite highBottom LineIf your into golf games then its a no brainer buy, if you like Hot Shots perhaps you should think twice about getting into the simulation.Overall80/100			",128,13,13,37,16,2,32

Early Access Review
								Not a fan. While I realize this game is advertised as a sim, I wasn't under the understanding that sim implied 0 degree of consistency over the controls. This game seems to be optimized to use a controller as opposed to the standard keyboard mouse input of a typical golf game (non-sim) which is fine, but I think this game could do well to have some gauge that could be toggled on or off to show you at least somewhere in the ballpark of how hard you're hitting.""We’ve created and fine tuned a swing mechanic that is more about feeling and fluidity above the users’ accuracy of hitting a marker on a power bar. Whilst anyone will be able to pick the controller up and play comfortably, the best players on the global leaderboards will be those with the best feel for the different golf shots and who are able to take into account ball lie, weather and terrain conditions.""I find the above to be utter garbage. The mechanic relies in NO way on feeling or fluidity, but instead an attempt to make visual placeholders of where a club is to indicate how powerful you're going to hit the ball. I also highly doubt most people will be abl to ""pick the controller up and play comfortably."" I only wish I hadn't believed their sales pitch, because it's anything but accurate. I can only hope it changes in the future, but I kind of doubt it, as the mechanic is already in place.I find the only way to fine tune your shot is to adjust the loft, which seems silly when normally one would simply hit the ball with less oomph. In short, the controls for this game, while refreshing and new, are in massive need of improvement/options. Had I known ahead of time what the controls were like, I very simply would've kept my $35. The big caveat to Steam is that there are no refunds, and now I'm out money for a game I likely will not play in the future. That said, the game itself is beautiful, and the audio is crisp, if not a bit repetetive (the actual sounds you hear on the course ie.) your ball hitting the ground, seem to be one and the same.) making it a very aesthetically appealing experience. Unfortunately I'm a firm believer that gameplay > aesthetics.			",39,3,1,8,5,0,2

												The Golf Club is a great idea. Place a golf sim game on the PC platform when other developers refuse to and give it a course creator. What could possibly go wrong with such a strong idea? Many things.First and foremost this game does not run well. Even on powerful machines you will innevitably find yourself playing on Medium or lower settings just to get a decent and constant framerate. This is something that can be overlooked by many but still needs to be stated as it is important.Ball striking is solid and good until you get close to the green. Due to the minimal control you have over shot distance anything other than a full 100% shot into the green is unlikely to land anywhere near where you intend it to. Putting is also a widely varying affair where getting correct distances is nearly impossible.The course creator is one of the shining positives in The Golf Club. It has enough functionality and customization to allow for a large variety of course types and difficulties. However, more recent updates had altered some of the terrain functionality making it difficult to create smoothed surfaces with large scale changes. Still, the course creator is definitely a strong point.The largest issue with this game currently is the seeming abandonment of the PC Platform. With their release on PS4 and XBox One, HB Studios have given continuous updates to both of the console platforms, yet have not updated the PC release with any of that content for 2 months as of this writing. ('Release was on October 8th, currently December 15th) This is the most diseheartening thing HB could have done. The console versions now have more HB created cources, 2 more course creator themes, and more bug fixes than the PC version.With this last point in mind, I cannot recommend this game. It is a wonderful idea with a nice course creator that seems to have been abandoned before it could be made into something great. If you really want a golf game on the PC platform and have no other options then pick this up when it is on sale for 50% off or more, otherwise just steer clear. If they ever come back and give the PC platform some love, it may be worth the asking price, but as it stands it is not.Edit: As of 12/19/2014 the PC and console versions are finally on the same patch. Going forward it is difficult to tell if they will become split so disparately as before but this does not change the core idea that it is better to wait for a sale for this game than to buy it at full price.

												I've been looking for a good golf game for the PC for a while now (The TW series doesn't count) and I caught this on a steam sale.  Been playing it for a while in early access and have enjoyed it immensely.  Now that the game's out, I have mixed feelings about it.  On one hand, the mechanics of the swing (I play with an xbox controller) are good and the way the ball reacts to the environment is very good.  However, something about it just seems rushed and unfinished.  I'll get hours upon hours of enjoyment out of it and hopefully it gets improved down the line because it's a good game, with the chance to be great.  Would definitely recommend to any golf fan, but it may not appeal to everybody because of the rough edges to it.			",72,10,10,17,26,1,23

												So far I am really enoying this simulation.  The sounds and graphics are very good and the frame rate is smooth (as long as you don't max out tree detail draw distance).I initially tried playing witht he mouse and found it to be quite frustrating. I switched to the Gamepad and that has made a huge difference.  Judging putting power can be a chore at first, but with practice you will get accustomed to it.The great thing about this game is there is no skill progression. Nothing to add points to  in order to increase accuracy, distance, etc.  It is all about how well you can use the sticks, judge the fairways and greens, and select good shots that setup good follow up shots.Also, no after striking modifications. Everything you do is done prior to ball striking, once it is in the air you are an observer.  I have worked my handicap index to just over 8, and won my local club season. Currently  in 14th place in the amateur season.			",168,8,8,27,49,2,38

												Truly a great golf game!  Clean graphicsSmooth gameplayClean MenusCourse Creator / workshopGreat offline co-opExcellent online multiplayer options  - like option to watch your opponents take their shots, or not!It keeps your stats, in a nice clean display.It keeps your friends stats on courses, so it has a great competitive element for those looking.Works great with 360 controllerI played Tiger woods 2010-2011 on PS3, it plays a lot like that, but without the spin, turbo, and gear upgrades-- finally, a clean golf game! It's a wonderful thing. There are no cheesy skill upgrades or post-shot gimmicks. You got to own your shots.I'm very happy I bought this. I played with my brother offline for several hours when I bought it, he went home and bought it and we're having a good time with it online.  If you are looking for an enjoyable GOLF game for your PC, I would definitley recommend The Golf Club! Buy it! Youre gonna be so happy, its going to be wonderful			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												((I wanted to add this info to top afterwards, since I failed to mention this before:Unless one specifically goes offline or play the offline-single-player-mode ""Seasons"", all the shots are recorded to online-storages, which is really amazing to me considering I've gotten to a point I semi-refuse to play ""hitscan-client-side-detection-only""-games and such without replay-systems nowadays.Unfortunately currently the replay-system is very barebones with only the playback option available, this far-cry to systems like ""Mario Golf Advance + Toadstool""-tour had.But hopefully this system will get further improved in the sequel / 2.0-update (AKA. ""The Golf Club 2"").)) The Overview:Alright, since the game currently is more closer to ""complete""-golf-game nowadays, I suppose it's finally a time to give an overview on this title.First of, what ""The Golf Club"" is:- ""Bare-bones ""just golf""""-game with emphasis on simulation.What ""The Golf Club"" is not:- ""Arcade-like""-golf game with ""Career""-modes to become stronger, more ""bling"", or anything else similar: It's ""Just-golf"".I personally have nicknamed this game as ""Tiger Woods PGA Tour Online ""without gorilla-suit"" and with perma-TrueSwing-mode""; not much else to comment about that aside that both games are / were quite well built into Unity3D-engine.((Those who are interested though, the ""Tiger Woods PGA Tour 12 - Masters"" is quite similar both the UI and the golf-play-wise, minus of course the (identical) ""Greens Fee"" and other things that were in ""PGA Tour Online.""))In other words for the most part your avatar customization is mainly limited to ""etique""-abiding outfits.And your golf-equipments are standardized performance-wise, meaning that there are no ""power-golf-clubs"". There might be more ""style-suiting"" equipment-options available in future (E.G slightly more wider+lighter-clubs to allow pitching from tougher spots with less ""carry"" due lessened-weight), but that's just one personal wishful-thinking.((Fair to mention that I personally mainly play with the least amount of ""assistance-UI"" as possible (green-grid, shot-direction-reticle, wind-indicator, and such), to which I base my overview on))As hinted earlier, the players are also limited to ""semi-TrueSwing"" system, since it's by design that there is no ""traditional 3-click-system"" in-game to emphasis on more ""feeling""-gameplay instead of being cold-hard-mechanical.Unfortunately at the moment, there is no ""dry-hitting"" so playing by just ""the feel"" alone isn't necessarily working for the favor of the players.And since the ""hitting-indicator"" isn't currently working exactly in real-time either (it appears only after the hit is done), the game turns unfortunately into quite fiddly ""percentage""-game because players are semi-forced to number-crunch with the ""lofts"" of their clubs if they want to make more accurate shots. So in the end the hitting-game (currently) is mainly limited to adjusting the loft of the clubs and hitting with max-power, since for the most part the ""fine-tune-club-action"" seen in various other ""TrueSwing""-game is quite non-existent.Point being, the swing+putting-system could be better since it's currently heavily dependant on ""power"" only (indicated by how ""back"" you ""Pull"" the clubs). But it suffices, somewhat.As for the courses (of the amount which in theory are infinite), I personally can only give a / some warning(s): Given that the major-amount of the courses are done by ""everyday-non-pro""-players, there are going to large amount of courses not following the ""official"" (real-life) recommendations; This is very important thing to remember, especially if you're into regular tournament participations.- Especially before the ""Out-of-Bounds"" (or ""O.B"")-system was implemented in, there is large amount of ""Trap-courses"", meaning that if you are very unfortunate to hit your ball into one of the ""trap-valleys"", you're going to be guaranteed end-up getting that ""+9"" (or any other ""max-hit""-amount set).- Since the game doesn't yet support the ""cup-place-randomization"", you're going to end seeing a huge amount of these placed in the middle of ""spiral-macaroni""-greens.What I am trying to say is the a quite a little amount of course-designers follow the following recommendation: ""A player putting from above the hole should be able to stop the ball near the hole."" Okay, that is just one part of the whole thing....For those who are interested for more info, here are few links:http://www.barryrhodes.com/2011/11/position-of-hole-on-putting-green.htmlhttp://www.randa.org/en/Rules-and-Amateur-Status/Guidance-on-Running-a-Competition.aspx?chapter=4&section=2In overall, ""The Golf Club"" is a nice change in the golf-game scenery in which you can simply jump-in and jump-out freely without need of worrying whether your have enough good ""gear"" or otherwise ""stats"" to simply play both by yourself and competing with other players.The issues mentioned above aside, the gameplay itself is pretty solid.And this game  isn't all that power-demanding alongside the game itself is being quite stable (at least on my quite low-spec-computer).On a extra note, the game also features a quite extensive API for those people who'd like to make more organized leagues and similar organizations.This allows websites such as tgctours.com to have more accurate data on the players themselves.Who knows though what the developers will eventually bring to this game; the possibilities are almost unlimited!

												Being a avid golfer in real life playing of an +2 handicap myself I have played most of the golf games out there. And to be honest most of them become boring because they are way to easy to master. The golf club however always seems to have a new challenge up its sleeve. I have read many reviews slamming the inconsistency of playing with your mouse. My experience is that yes it is challenging but fair. I have played and struggled but learned with each round (Pro Tip, get yourself a proper mouse and a good gaming mouse pad I recommend a Gamdias Pad). Through practice and practice you can achieve amazing things and compete without a gamepad or building a swing rail(cheating in my opinion.). Now my in game handicap is at +9 and getting better(Just shot a 55 at Flathead).You would think that if you played off a +9 you have mastered the game, but you would be mistaken. In elite tournaments playing on your handicap will only just get you in the top 50. Its all about the quest we as golfers share but never attain...Perfection. The quest to be the best and the opportunity to really compete with thousands of other golfers is what makes the golfers club an amazing golf game. Now to the game play. Is it perfect? No, there are problems, especially regarding the rules. With rules I refer to the lack of dropping in the game when you are unfortunate enough to land in a water hazard of end up in an unplayable lie. Most times the re-hit option is enforced only on a rare occasion does the game will drop for you. As for the unplayeble situation, it play it as it lies(or restart ;-) ) There is no custom drop option which is annoying.(They have rectified the droping problem with the last update!04/05/2015)How do you become good? Swinging straight is only 10pecent of the battle. You really have to think about you shot: Club selection, Shot Type, Height, Shape and the most important part of all, where do you want to hit the next shot from. Especially when it comes to where you what to putt from. Speed and rythm of your swing is also very important. Don't think a fast back and through will do it or get you more distance.The Golf Club is an Awsome golf game and I feel it is one of my best purchases on steam to date. I can't wait for the Seasons DLC to come out. No problem with buying it as a add on. I feel I have gotten more that my moneys worth so far.Highly recommended!!!!! You get out what you put in just like in real life golf!			",88,6,1,8,15,2,13

												I love this game. It doesn't hold your hand. It can be frustrating, mixed in with some sweet moments. Just like real golf. There is no special ""tap X and your ball will roll faster"" Tiger Woods bs. So if you like that kind of an arcadish experience, then you probably won't like this game. Great visuals and sounds. Best golf game I have ever played. (note: right now if you're running a Nvidia card you have to roll back to the mid April driver (GTA V release driver) to be able to play. Something with Nvidia's latest drivers is making the game crash before you can even enter the main menu. Please don't let that deter you away from a great game though. The devs know about it and are working on it.)			",205,23,11,21,10,3,12

The only thing i would like to see is better multiplayer capability. It takes some menu jumping to get everyone in game together at once.Lastly I'd like some kind of power meter on the swings.

I won many tournaments then hit a wall where I cannot hit a drive on fairway even playing it safe.  Up and down movement on the y axis is no true way to swing a club and is a nuissance, not a true measure of skill and there has been no enjoyment here.

												A cool game with great basic courses  and game modes.  If you're looking for some decent courses, a good editor, and decent controls this is the golf game for you.That said.  This game has a number of SERIOUS issues at the time of writing.  First off online competition is broken. Many players use auto-shot programs and will finish a single round anywhere from 20-30 under par.  Second, you need to pay an additional 10 dollars for the real game, after buying all the extra modes and the editor in the main package.The biggest issue, however, are the graphics.  This game looks amazing... when the graphics decide to function correctly.  At random times they will glitch causing anything from horrific mutilations of the course, to blinding you, to preventing critical info like wind speeds and pin distance to show.  You CANNOT fix these issues, the best you can do is shut the game down and PRAY it works when you reboot.  Expect this to ruin many rounds for you unless you use an auto-shot program.

												I barely reccomend, because this game is OK for being on $ale, but could be made far better.This is the best Golf game I have tried, but is by far NOT the pretiest, and would need a Cray Supercomputer to run full settings and look pretty like the videos used here depict to hock it. Don't trust me, look at the discussion boards or Google it. Most complaints and developer answers are 2014-2015, so I have zero hope of any further graphical or FPS tweaks, period.That said:I do like the game. The graphics are semi-pretty for Unity's decade old look and less than smooth feel.The physics are excellent, but unlike has been said by developers I don't believe the engine uses more than one single core at all. This game bogs down if any setting is too high or if too much activity is onscreen. Which is very often.SUMMARY:If you have an extremely powerful PC, and a much newer video card than you may be able to get 30-40fps on medium settings. Don't belive me, then look it up or roll the dice like I did. And I have a NICE PC & Win 10.A great buy for $5 to $7 - only, no moreI would very much eat my words and reccommend highly should the devs ever address the poor framerates and lack of video tweaking. But since nothing has been improved in ages, wish that in one hand and spit in the other and see which gets filled quicker...☺			",103,5,2,5,28,0,5

												After many years of shelling out money for other golf games and then having to pay more for extra golf courses, I've finally found the ideal solution to my common peeve.  A course with a built-in creator.  There are thousands of courses to choose from.The controls are similar  to the TW series from EA.  It's a game that you're going to struggle with at first, but as you keep playing and practicing, you will get much better.  There are no special power-ups, pants, or hats, just an equal playing field where the individuals that are the most skilled, shine.The creator is accessible to everyone.  You can have it design the course for you and automatically generate a course based on some random parameters you enter.  Or you can start with a blank slate, place the 1st tee and green wherever you want and draw the fairway in between and then plant the bunkers.The creator may seem daunting to some and they may find themselves intimidated by all the features and controls.  But there is an incredibly active community on the game website's forum http://www.hb-studios.com/forum/index.php#c7, and a well built community focused on competitive tournaments that are cross platform http://tgctours.com/Best parts about this game is that it's constantly upgrading and improving.  If you had a look at this game when it was first released, take another look at it.  There have been dozens of major features added to the creator AND play modes with more on the way.  Also, if you ever have  problem, the developers and players are quick to answer questions and help you when you run into trouble.This is a golf game you shouldn't ignore.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's graphically really nice, the course designer is really cool... but the gameplay is fairly boring and a little frustrating.  It's difficult to judge shots that aren't full shots, theres' no meter to show  your swing power, it seems like shot shape is totally determined by mouse movement tempo... get a little quick and you'll be hooking  your way around the course.  Tournament play is dull, I've only ever played ""ghost"" players.  There's no storyline style of play w/ some sort of career path or tour path.  There's no variety of equipment or ability to maybe get some ""boost"" going from an amatuer to say a pro where you swing a little faster and get more distance, etc.  Overall it's not fun enough to hold my attention for more than about 10 mins at a time unless you're designing a course and then you can spend hours tweaking it (which sadly I have) and I probably won't play it much in the future.

												This game is a great golf game for both heavy and light players. The scenery looks very nice and the basics of the game are easy for pick up and play; however the hardest courses can be a tough challenge for any experienced player. This game also has, in my opinion, one of the best level designers I have seen in any game (it can be a bit wonky at times but after 1 or 2 courses you can easily put together a unique custom course in a couple of hours, or just randomly generate a course in a matter of minutes)The main complaint I see if that the game is not complete, which is true. However every big patch the developers release is exceptionally solid, although maybe a bit slow they release meaningful and necessary content every time.			",170,32,3,27,36,4,30

												The Golf Club is a very good golf game with a good approach of what this sport is !The gameplay is almost perfect for me, but... why almost ?? Because I love the fact that it's optimized for gamepad, but I blame that we have not the full control of club movement. Just a pitty, because we are not far from perfection !The atmosphere is relaxing and well done, but, once again, lacks some stuff like public, and maybe some environment like city in the background (it feels a little lonely) !Other and real downside about this game is the optimisation ! I hope devs really examine the problem and will patch it !To sum up : I say YES, it's a great golf game, a current reference, but some content and tweaking required to make the ultimate one !!

												This is the best golf game out there.  Course creation is fantastic and easy to use and gives basically unlimited courses to play.  Can't reccommend this enough over EA's Tiger Woods offering.			",174,22,12,24,33,10,44

												Excellent golf game for True Swingers, putting is tough but once you get the measure of it, it becomes a lot better. Graphics are real good. Courses are very good, plus the added fact that the in game Course Designer, is very simple to use, so you can design Courses with ease, you don't have to be an expert to do this. I would buy this Game if you like playing golf. 5 star rating from me for this one. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall I like this game, but in its current state I cannot recommend it.  First off, it is definitely not optimized for PC.  It runs poorly at best.  The second issue is a lack of any type of tutorial or instruction, which may or may not solve the other issue: putting.  Putting is confusing and seems very inconsistent.  Verdict: Wait.For the curious, I have an Asus ROG G75 with a core i7 CPU and Geforce 670MX graphics card.  It runs everything I throw at it (see my extensive library for reference)			",804,322,43,144,92,9,118

												I have been playing this game since the Early access release and whata treat it is!Getting better and better with every update, running smoothly on an AMD fx8350/gtx770 from Nvidia. the game lives up his name, with more and more features comming with every update, a good tech team who handles communications very well. yeah, the career mode is missing but so what, it's also about online play, and even with some glitches or hickups once in a while, you need to buy this game.only point is: Play it with a controller, the feeling is better when you control your swing with the stick.

												I seriously LOVE this game. It's so realistic. No arcade elements make this game as close to a real golfing as possible. I have no idea why this game has ""Mixed"" reviews. Maybe it's the fact that there's no meters or gauges, so it's a little harder to make perfect shots. But it's possible. And once you master the shots and putting, it's awesome game... I give it 9,5/10			",4,2,1,2,8,0,3

												First off, if you are looking for a Tiger Woods replacement, then this may not be for you. The graphics are excellent on my laptop (i7 2.4, Geforce GT740 and 16g Ram) - smooth scrolling and sharp, clear detail. I found a controller the easiest / best way to play the game.In my opinion, the game does not need a career mode as suggested by some players. Yes, it can be repetative, but so is the actual game of golf. There are currently in excess of 50,000 user created courses, some better than others. You can create your own course in five minutes if you like, or spend hours adjusting pretty much any aspect of each hole. Having access to user created courses, competitions and tours adds an extra dimension to The Golf Club that I have not come across in other golf games. I have no problem with the wind and find this fairly accurate, along with 'clubbing up or down' depending on the height of the greenThe introduction of the Handicap system means you can continually try to lower your handicap on the handicap rated courses or simply play as many different courses as you want.One thing I would like to see is a layout map of a course (like you get on the back of a scorecard) before I select to play it. Some more courses from the developers would also be good.........Overall, the best golf game by far - no gimicks, just as much golf as you want. I can see why some may not like this game because of it's simplicity - if that is the case, get yourself an old copy of Tiger Woods :-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

YouTube™ Video: Analog Reviews: The Golf Club

			Trent hits the links in The Golf Club to see if EA's golf franchise finally has some worthy competition. Please like and subscribe for more reviews, gameplay, and discussions!		

It's been quite some time since golf fans have been spoiled for choice. EA has dominated one of the worlds most regal games for more than a decade and those who play games on a PC in particular have been left with little to no choice in how they hit the links. Enter The Golf Club, a new Golf simulator from HB studios that doesn't boast PGA licensing or tons of product placement, but it does offer a massive game changing feature that is sure to land in the fairway with most virtual golfers: a course editor. Instead of shelling out absurd sums of money for new courses players now have access to a surprisingly robust course creation tool with Greg Norman's name slapped across it. So does The Golf Club burst on the scene like Tiger Woods circa 1997 or does it choke like Sergio Garcia on Sunday at a major? Without PGA licensing, The Golf Club feels more like a virtual golf outing with friends than a tense and competitive sports simulation. There isn't a character creator, no RPG like leveling or character progression, no unlockables nor upgrades. The Golf Club also doesn't offer any alternative modes like challenges or mini games. You simply pick a course or a tournament and hit the links. Asynchronous play is generally the preferred play mode if you don't have good buddies available for eighteen since it allows brisk competitive play. Your competitors strokes are shown as you take your own and minimal load times keep the pace up and reduces the tedium present in other golf titles. A generic announcer provides the only semblance of professional golf tournament ambiance since galleries of spectators, scoreboards and tournament sponsor signs are all absent from the game's courses. The announcer does a decent job of reacting to your shots and making accurate assessments of the conditions on the course, but his personality is on par with a rusty, dinged-up pitching wedge. It's a shame that HB studios didn't utilize the freedom of not being a PGA licensed product to offer some more festive commentary a la Gary McCord at the 1994 Masters Tournament.  The Golf Club's bare bones feature set and lack of atmosphere and ambiance are not it's most prominent offense however, its the fact that the actual golf mechanics feel woefully underdeveloped. The game seems to favor a grip it and rip it mentality as any attempt I made to be clever with my shots ended in utter disaster with the exception of the instances in which the game decided to make some sort of idiotic club selection—teeing off on a par five with an 8-iron for instance. Speaking of club selection a clunky interface makes proper club selection tedious. Players must enter the scout camera mode to see where their ball may end up with a solid shot and if players wish to see where a different club might place the ball, the scout mode needs to be exited and a new club selection needs to be made. Spinning the ball or controlling draw or fade is slightly awkward with a shot modifier that needs to be dialed in before making a stroke. There is also very little feedback when trying to control the strength of your shots. Taking a few yards off of a stroke becomes an exercise in frustration since the difference between 70% and 100% power is a millimeter of travel on the analog stick and there are no meters or other visual indicators to allow players to get a feel for it. If there is another way to modify the strength of your shots I could not find it and a tutorial was not provided. The game's bare bones approach also means that you are stuck with a fixed club selection so don't expect to carry a hybrid or a long iron in place of your five wood.  Thankfully, the course editor in The Golf Club does not disappoint. Offering desert, links, alpine, rural and autum tile sets and a wide array of props, the course editor easily allows players to build realistic courses with few limitations. A number of sliders that populate the world with vegetation, water and hills automates some of the more tedious aspects of design. Bridges, wildlife, structures and props allow you to breathe life into each hole and imbue your course with some personality. Editing can be done hole by hole or freely across the entire course. Coupled with the game's mostly pleasing visuals it's exciting to turn your vision into a virtual reality and then share it with the world. It's just a shame that the frame rate can be slower than the senior tour—even on powerful hardware. The Golf Club brings to mind all of those 1990's home designer software packages available in most electronics stores. Teeing off in The Golf Club is underwhelming but creating courses is any golf fan's dream. The actual golf is a bit clunky and in need of a swing coach with it's poor feedback, lack of club selection, and cumbersome UI. The lack of atmosphere and character progression do little to incentivize actually playing the game. While The Golf Club hasn't quite passed Q School, it's not entirely irredeemable. With so few choices for PC gamers, The Golf Club is worth considering for serious golf fans, those on consoles have a little more to consider but the course creator is quite compelling. In the end, The Golf Club logs a bogey on the score card.			",1843,697,76,250,218,18,319

Early Access Review
								UPDATED 17/06/2015I've been gaming since the '70s and I've played a lot of different games over that time on a lot of different systems.  But until now I've not known a games company support their product like HB have.  It is still receiving incredible updates; so much so that it is almost unrecognisable to the original release.The game has swallowed my life.  Buy it.ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOWI've spent a lot of time with this game now and I'm looking forward to spending more time with it.At the time of review, this game is in Early Release.  But you wouldn't know.  If you pay your money now then you are getting a highly polished game.  If you like golf, you'll love this.The game itself is immensely addictive.  It is much more of a simulation compared to the nonsensical arcade style of Tiger Woods (Hit a good shot, penalised because you weren't wearing a Nike wristwatch?).It is easy to hit a bad shot on this game and putting can be difficult.  But hit a good shot and you'll be rewarded - just like real golf.  And that is the point.  It *feels* like real golf.  You'll get frustrated at your bad shot 'cos you know you can do better.  You'll stop and think on each of your shots.  A good round of golf *feels* like a good round.  If you've played golf games in the past then you'll know how much of an achievement this is.  And I've been playing golf games since NIck Faldo Plays The Open came out on the Spectrum in 1985.The course creator is a real gem.  It is a beautiful tool.  Take a look at the game's forums and see some of the creations that have been put down by the community.  Many people have spent 50 hours + on their work - and it shows.  But the real beauty is the simplicity of the tool.  You can create a beautiful course in no time at all - and with little effort.  But if you put a bit of effort in, then you and others will appreciate the results.Proposed additions to the game will make this even better.  Frankly, this is a must buy for anyone with an interest in golf.  You won't be dissapointed.			",44,19,1,23,40,1,53

												I originally gave this game a thumbs up, but after so many hours of frustrations and things that don't or half work I am done with it. I almost punched my monitor the last time I played out of frustration. In the 90 hours I have played I think I have uninstalled this game at least 6 times due to rage quitting, only to reinstall it again the next day and giving it an other go. So the game was already frustrating from day 1, but the game also has a lot going for itself so I kept comming back for more. Enough is enough now, the frustrations while playing the game are not healthy for me. If the frustrations were the result of my own errors and bad playing it would not be a problem, but the game coding and design is to blame here. Issues:There are so many times that the game doesn't register your swing (with the mouse) properly and you end up hitting the ball with 70% power. You spend already 45 minutes on a course trying to hit the best you can and then the game just screws it up by not registring your swings while you hit just as hard as the other swings that got registered as 100% power. It also can happen that the ball mid air takes a sharp right/left turn while you swing straight. And no this is not due to ball effect or wind, it is the game that again not registers your swing correctly. It almost feels as a prescripted 'bad swing'.There is a course creator, which in itself is a great feature. The game laysout a random course for you with a course generator. After that you want to edit it, but you have to do that through an afwul User Interface with sub menu's. After 20 hours I was still searching for the right feature constantly. The editor also lets you NOT edit vital parts of the course, good luck adding fairway to raised land, it won't let you. A nice guy on the forum tried to help with explaining a way to bypass the flaws of the creator, but after almost 30 hours in the creator without having made even 1 decent course I gave up, it's not worth the hassle.Also things like Alt Tabbing out of the game and then opening the game again keeps the game in windowed mode. Pressing Alt Enter to go to full screen again opens an other instance of the game while not closing the windowed instance on the background... so you have now 2x the game running with 50% less FPS. Press Alt Enter more times and it keeps adding running instances of the game in the background.This game could be a great game and in between the frustrations I did had fun, but there are things wrong under the hood of the game that sucks the fun out of it and makes it unnecessarily a frustrating flawed game. The community seems pretty decent and helpful, it's not their fault.They are creating a TGC2, I sure hope it will not be as flawed as this version.The game has a lot of potential and it could definitely be my favorite golf game, but they really need to try to get all the nice features and ideas implemented with better coding under the hood and preferably with an other game engine that is more optimized at rendering 1000+ trees and water and stuff. Sadly after +90 hours and an initial thumbs up it has become a thumb down.Still, if you see this game on a nice sale, grab it. It will give you some hours of fun. Just stop playing when the frustrations start to kick in.			",148,11,15,23,22,1,29

												I'd say its a good pickup.  I get just as frustrated in the game as i do real life.  I play with a controller and recomend you do to.  I wish it had tutorials to show the finer points of the game.  I feel like they introduce wind as a way to build artificial difficulty.

Putting takes a bit of getting used to but feels real good when you get the hand of it.There are more courses than you'll ever be able to play and there are always more being created.

												IMHO, there's a glitch with the game. As of this entry, that glitch has not been fixed. Not being able to complete my swing began after I upgraded to Windows 10. What I found worked in that situation where I couldn't complete my swing was, while still on the hole I was having problems completing my swing on I hit alt+enter, clicked inside the game window, then hit alt+enter again. This caused some artifacts to appear. Then I hit the escape key, clicked exit game, clicked accept, then, from the main menu I resumed the game, then I was able to complete my swing and continue play and didn't notice any more swing hang ups. Hope this helps.			",20,0,0,0,1,0,1

												I honestly didn't like the controls in game or for the map editor.And I didn't want to put in the 100's of hours to perfect the feel of the swing as I would rather do that in real life.As for the controls in the editor, most were clumsy and clunky.My frustration level while playing/creating was though the roofWhich is a shame because everything else about the game was really cool.I really wanted to like this game as it's nearly everything I want in a golf game. UghAvatar Golf for Xbox Live is still the pinnacle of golf in my eye. Which is silly when you think about it.If you are willing to learn the control scheme, you may find great enjoyment. There is definately a good game in there. You can tell the developers put a lot of care into their product. But just be aware that it will take getting used too and time.			",192,26,13,16,18,4,13

												I am a golf casual, I do not watch, play or follow the sport, but the games have always interested me. Coming from the era of Sensible Golf on the Amiga 1200, and the PGA Tour series on the Mega Drive, it has been a rather long time since playing a golf sim, unless if you count GTA V, of course.I tired Perfect Golf some weeks ago, before the rebranding, and I had to refund that in about half hour. It was clunky, terrible detailing, and poor selection of courses. I picked this up in the sale today, and it is just miles better. Visually and mechanically better, with hundreds of official and fan made courses availible at a few clicks, offers much more variety straight off the... club (not bat, obviously).The progression system here seems to make more sense, and I can see that online play would be super fun with like minded friends. And controller support, which suits me more for a game like this.There may be a slightly tongue in cheek humour to this sim for those that, shall we say, need to adapt to how to swing effectively, but you can always mute the snarky commentator. For a Unity title it is pretty smart, and looks nice enough on the default/lower settings (GTX 970), but would need a Titan or the new GTX 1080 to really push the detailing and keep it above 60fps.For a non-branded golf sim this is pretty sweet, and one of the better choices on Steam.

Has the developer even played golf before?-Not enough spin on short/mid iron shots. Again, watch the PGA Tour sometime.-Wind is inconsistent. Can vary from 0 to 15mph on any course for some reason. Makes some rounds much easier than others.-I wish there was a better way to discover new courses			",42,2,2,2,4,1,2

												Me and Golf games: I'm a filthy casual, in terms of playing golf games.Review: Worth it, buy it.Top-quality in graphics, animations, and a lovely commentary. The gameplay is more in-depth than your average ""click on the senter of the bar for maximum goal chance"" although the controls might need work but sufficiant and playable =)			",589,105,8,19,53,5,36

												This piece of art has tremendous potential. I am thankful to the developers for a lovely game where I can play a large amount of golf between writing mission critical code and working on my software developments (relaxation much). What makes this game excellent is:1. The swing mechanic isn't newcomer friendly. The swing has a learning curve, you MUST pull your mouse backwards and then forwards to thrust your shots. This step done by you controlling your hand, wrist and arm need be precise for perfect shots otherwise you will inherit a large handicap. The handicap can be thought as a rank, the lower the handicap, the better your precision in this game I conclude.The game plots a linear traversal of your mouse movement per shot, thus you can see if you need improve pulling back or pushing forward to maintain a straight swing of each club.2. Each club is distinct, each has its own feel and each has a distinct difficulty to master.3. The game is not arcade-like, it caters to a hardcore gamer. Thus it may be considered in time a golf variant eSports title, much like Counter Strike is to professional FPS players.4. MAPS! The game includes real-world golf courses thus adding more realism. The game also includes algorithms so that, a) other players can create courses and upload them for other players to play and b) you can play a new course in literally seconds thus new content additions driven by the community for the community.A sound financial investment for years of golf playing for those of us struck at our desk. Try it, when you get the hang of it, its fun.---Things I'd like to see in future.1. Graphical Settings, I would like to tweak all settings, my computer is a beast and I want to see what is enabled when I've set the game launch settings to HIGH.2. Frame Rendering when Window is Inactive. I play in windowed mode and not fullscreen, thus when I window switch to a work window, I want to be able to see frame updates in the game window (which is inactive) without having to click on it again. This is useful when in multiplayer, watching others play etc whilst I can write some more code inbetween my shots.3. Customisation options, character customisation etc.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I purchased this game when it was still in development, and it has come a long way. Ok, I am not a pro golfer but I love spots games, and this one is no exception. The only thing I would complain about is that the physics are too exact to real life, so much so my swing has the same results it does in real life...tat wicked right hook...lol...With all sincerity, this is fun if you just want to hit the ball around. If you use a mouse you will have more control, but using a controller is hit and miss, I recommend using a mouse instead. Overall it is a very solid, stable, and as long as you use the mouse it is a very playable game too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have really enjoyed playing this game.. has a few things that can be fixed but overall if you love to golf, you overlook certain things.  The course generator needs to add a backdrop for tropical courses.. also to be able to click on the hole listing to the right when you want to edit a hole rather than going to overview of the course looking for the hole and , well you know the deal.. some things could be a bit easier for designing.  BUT I am having fun creating courses. and also playing  the game itself.. I suck.. but then I sucked in real life golf as well. I hope some of my friends will consider the purchase when the price comes down so that we can meet up in the clubhouse			",129,0,20,2,7,5,0

												Bought this in a sale a few weeks ago, and I've been enjoying both playing and creating courses. The gameplay is quite pared back, which I think works quite well. I play on a controller, and it's difficult to control distance except with 100% shots, which I think is quite realistic. Worth checking out a guide on the putting though. Easy once you know what you're doing, but control of distance while putting is not explained in the game itself.Only thing I don't like is the way bunkers are treated, where they just reduce the club distance by e.g. 50%, regardless of whether the ball is plugged or just trickled in.Best thing about the game is the huge number of user created courses, both recreations of real-world courses and original courses. Creating courses is straightforward after watching a youtube video or two, although the course creater seems to have been designed with a controller in mind rather than mouse and keyboard.

												Good golfing sim, I love the additions on the DLC with Seasons, a new course theme, and 3 new HB Official courses. The game feels more complete with Seasons which is basically offline career mode. I think the DLC should have been part of the original game or at least given free to Early-Access buyers like me :-). The Golf Club Community is not big and overall mixed reviews, If you haven’t bought this game yet you might as well wait for the new EA Sports Rory Mcilroy PGA Tour, unless you love golf that much and can’t wait. Oh and... NO 3 CLICK SWING SYSTEM!?			",20,4,0,0,5,0,1

Early Access Review
								So, I've been mostly trying to stay away from early access games, particularly story driven games, which, in my opinion, are very ill suited for early access.  However certain types of games are well suited for early access, and sports games fall into that category.  Plus, I was really desperate for a golf game, so I took a chance and picked up The Golf Club.This game has a ton of potential and is already in pretty decent shape, for something this far from being finished.  The game is very playable right now, even though many modes and features are missing, as is to be expected of an early access game.I really enjoy the mechanics of the game.  This is not your standard 3 click fare.  I have yet to play with the mouse, but gamepad controls work really well.  You aim with the left thumbstick and swing with the righ, pulling back to wind up, then pushing up to swing.  Hitting standard full power shots is relatively straight forward.  Intentionally hitting a slice or hook to get around an obstacle, or doing a 3/4 swing is much much touchier and riskier, as it should be.  There is also less hand holding than in most golf games, which is great.  You need to figure out effects of wind and such on your own.A highlight of the game is the course creation tool.  While it's missing some templates at the moment, as well as a lot of features, it;s already a really good and robust tool.  With a few parameters you enter the tool will procedurally generate a course in seconds, then you can tweak the course to your heart's content.  There are already hundreds of user made coursed published, some hastily slapped together or nonsensical, but many really beautiful and well made.In conclusion, this game is already pretty good, and it will only get better from here on out.  I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a golf game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: September 28, 2014
												I've been playing PC golf games since Mean 18 back in 1986. This is a game I'd give a ""meh"" to more than  just Yes or a No, but considering the lack of development the last few months I'm giving it the thumbs down. That's mostly due to the launch condition of the game. There are some sins that should not be tolerated by the public and the launch of this game was abysmal.The Golf Club is a pretty mediocre representation of golf with issues that have been around since it launched in early access - inconsistent swing meters, very poor performance, dull voice overs, varying object qualities, iffy physics, overpowered wind and a few other problems. Anyone who claims this is a ""simulator"" doesn't understand the meaning of the word. You can tweak your shot, but the shot mechancis themselves are uninteresting and (unfortunately for multiplayer) extremely easy to ""cheat"" with. Edging with the mouseswing is a common problem online and in virtually every match you'll run into someone who is using it to hit every shot dead straight. The career mode was released later and is DLC, which didn't make me too happy considering the massive release problems. Customers should have gotten more for their loyalty and patience.That doesn't mean that the game is totally horrid. If you're lucky enough that the game runs well for you, then you're less likely to run into the swing meter issues (they're often based on sudden frame rate drops). Get the right course at the right time of day and the game can be quite attractive. The course designer isn't as powerful as some, but it's quite easy to use and the pregeneration of terrain is something that is a great idea. It's a Power to the People course designer and you'll see lots of them, some of them quite clever.The devs are hit and miss. They are not bad folks, but they knew a lot of these problems existed and rushed the game out the door to match the console release (and it's quite obvious this is a console golf game first and foremost). So fixing obvious problems like the green grid not working or being able to retract your course from the public (if you accidentally published it) have gone lacking. The short game is another place in this that the game is abysmal - forget trying to hit half or three-quarter shots because the mechanics don't lend themselves to doing so. Some of these issues have been subsequently fixed. Some have not. The post-December patch seems to have improved performance. They've stoped farting  around with trying to boost the user ratings of their own courses. In short, they've made progress. This is the good part. However, it's still not a simulation and there's no way I'm giving this a thumbs up because of the horribly botched release and months of inaction of their part.However, the swing is still tempermental and relies on frame rate to achieve 100%. Turn the settings up and the swing meter goes wonky. And now there's too many really lousy courses to comb through, so finding something worth playing has become an exercise in futility. What's worse is that you can't even provide any kind of decent feedback and to rate the course you still have to complete the round. Who wants to complete a round on a course that sucks? That's both the good and the bad part of having a designer that will spit out somewhat ready-made courses. You simply get an overabundance of stuff to choose from but then finding a good course is like looking for a needle in a haystack.Personally, I find that Perfect Golf simply ""plays"" a much better round of golf. Then again I'm partial to that Links 2003 style of approach to golf. YMMV but I'm glad this isn't the only PC golf game on the market. Long story short, good effort, mediocre execution, questionable development...equals thumbs down (or at least buy only on sale). I can't recommend this at full price.			",81,36,8,60,54,5,57

And to be able to have the exact daily pin placements is mind blowing.Best Golf Sim Ever.The putting still gets me on occasion but so does the real thing.Kudos to the Devs on a masterpiece.

												I got this game around 2 years ago and I love it. The base game itself isn't really why though. I use TGCTOURS.COM which is basically an online tournament/competitive league simulating all the real life tours. I'm sure there are other websites such as this one but I havn't really looked into it. If you aren't really into that then the course designer is AMAZING! You can pretty much do anything to your course and its awesome! Check out some tutorials on youtube first and make sure you never auto generate your holes, build them yourselves. For some cool courses I recommend going onto the forums (thegolgclubgame.com) and checking out the courses there. If you aren't into either building courses or playing in online tournaments, then this game isn't for you. ALSO: if you do not have a controller this game is... meh. It is literally impossible to swing without a controller for me and it is NOT a 3 click swing mechanic game. Controller is pretty much a must.			",41,5,1,1,8,1,4

												The sim has potential, even though it was most likely released prematurely. The course editor is fair, although it too, seems to be lacking some. Having said that, it is possible to produce a nice course with effort.Downside is anyone and everyone can publish a course.  Some are great while mose are just Auto-generated with no real thought placed into them. Making a hugh library of crap courses.  Problem here is you don't know how bad they are until you play them. Even a few of the ""HB Official"" course are questionable.  A course review by users would help determine which course would be worth playing. but, then you have to weed out the ""typical"" bash or praise user comments.  Ditto on the course rating system.  ratings are worthless without some sort of commentary to back them up.However, this is no reason to at least purchase the sim and try it yourself. It is worth the 35 dollars.  It does appear that HB Studios is working on continual improvements for the PC user side of the coin.  I'm not a fan of ""console"" sim games.  Console and serious ""Simulation Games"" and non exsistant in my opinion.  I know this is harsh to some, but being old school hard core computer geek.  Consoles will never match to power of a high-end computer sim.  Software companies save cost issues on coding for multi-gaming platforms and Console gamers make them the most money, so the PC user usualy is the Dinosaur in the room for gamers.I still think that in the end, if you're a PC gamer, this wll be a great sim after a few more patches and issues get resolved.Getting it now will allow you to get use to the gameplay and feel for what HB has done.  Graphics are great eye-candy, but can be taxing on a even a high-end video card.I still find this sim very enjoyable. And at times, just as frustrating as in ""real"" golf!			",13,0,13,0,9,0,7

												A quick history about me and golf games; I've been interested and played golf games since the early LINKS series on DOS/Windows, as well as Tiger Woods, and other iterations throughout the years. I haven't played a game on the PC in years, and purchased this game during the Early Access period.First impressions! Beautiful landscapes, variety of enviroments, endless courses to play (thanks to generation and community games), native controller support, Couch COOP and online modes! The feature set is impressive, and the controls seem natural and well thought out. It's an easy game to get into, but a tough game to master, exactly like golf. :) Playing online with friends is a bit different, as you are set to play simultaneously on the same course by default. You can however, change it to 'Alternate Shot' by a quick visit to the menu. No relog required.Some nice changes I'd like to see! I'd like to see more variety in the player creation (more clothing options, more customizability), as well as customized clubs or bags for an added touch. These would be flavour items only, and provide no additional benefits (as the game is designed). The game could also benefit from a bit of an easier way to join friends games, such as using the Steam Menu 'Join Game'. Summary - A beautifully designed, well executed golf game, with procedural course design and an endless pool of community talent, this may be the best golf game ever released on PC.

												As you can probably see, this game has mixed views and opinions on whether or not this game is worth it. Hopefully this review can help you decide whether the game is worth it or not.If you are interested in playing an unlimited amount of courses created by yourself and thousands online, if you like to build courses with an excellent course creator, if you want a game that is considered a ""golf simulator"", if you want a golf game with a fun, active forum community and if you want a golf game with a VERY ACTIVE dev team, this is your game. This game is truly just about the golf itself.If you are looking for a golf game with a crowd cheering behind you, to play on a tour (amongst the pros) and earn cash or XP to customize what your character is wearing and how he looks plus the gear he is using, to level up your golfer, to play with pro players, and to play on real courses, this is not the game for you. People have, HOWEVER, recreated a TON of real courses in The Golf Club, and many, many of them are FANTASTIC!In general: Don't waste your money on this if you aren't truly looking for a golf game that is focused primarily on the golf itself. If you are more interested in how your character looks and levels up, I'd look elsewhere. I, myself, LOVE this game, as I care much more about the golfing experience rather than character customization, a tour and a crowd. I followed this game months before its release date, and the game has done nothing but improve over its lifespan.These are just my opinions! Overall: 8.5/10; recommended for gamers (or golfers) wanting a golf sim.EDIT: I also forgot! It is recommended that you have a controller, such as a wired xbox 360 controller, to play this game.

								To be fair it's pretty much the only game in town in terms of PC golf sim since EA's execrable Tiger Woods The Masters debacle, and the good news is it's a thoroughly decent effort, easy to pick up and play, but with skills to master through ongoing play, nice to look at (although as a beta it's all in need of a final polish).  For an early access game it really is outstanding, by the time it reaches alpha and the community get to work with the course editor to produce some real world courses there may well be nothing to touch it on the PC or consoles. Heartily recommended for anyone who still remembers Links fondly.			",74,5,12,6,12,0,28

								Oh my! Finally a very playable Early Access. It is great to see these guys have stepped outside of the box and opted out of using a swing meter and 3 click system. Finally a golf game that allows you to make and share your own courses with the community. This is fastly shaping up to be a must have for any sports sim fan.			",157,23,6,21,88,6,45

												Haven't played a golf game on my PC for years. This is definitely a golf game. It's definitely made in unity. It's alright. It's the best I've played on PC for a while. It's not easy to master like the Tiger Woods franchise, which could be a good or bad thing. Doesn't have the same sort of progression as Tiger Woods either where you feel like you're getting better-and-better. I hate Tiger Woods. The game not the person. Anyone who drives around in a massive SUV, coked off his face with hookers is alright in my book. Wait. What am I talking about? I hate Tiger Woods the person too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm really enjoying this game.  The controls take a little getting used to at first, but become much more natural and fluid as you play.  I'm liking the swing mechanic without all the added options and settings of other games  (in-air spin control, etc.). There are many, many  courses to play, and the Course Creator is pretty fun too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am a golf instructor and author of ""Golf Demystified"" on Amazon who has played golf for 28 years.  For this reason, I believe my experience and knowledge counts for this review.  The Golf Club is the most realistic golf games I have ever played.  Yes, I have played every golf game.  I currently have devoted 105 hours playing it.  The sheer number of courses and various terrain really draws the player into the game.  Of course, it is not perfect.  First, you need to play the game with a controller to really enjoy the experience.  Second, the game is challenging like the game of golf.  Third, there is room for improvement and additions.  Overall, it is worth scheduling a tee time to play The Golf Club.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I genuinely do not understand the negative reviews for The Golf Club.The physics are great, the graphics are current and crisp, the controls, while difficult to master, are perfectly fine, and the user created courses are supurb.  In fact, the creation tools is one of this game's strongest features.  I've had a ton of fun playing this game and will continue to do so when I'm not out playing real golf.

Early Access Review
								This review was inspired by some of the forum posts i have seen of late. Many are complaining that it's difficult, other's try to compare this to tiger woods. The biggest complaint is the fact that this game is difficult, it has not indication of where the ball will land, you cannot change your power on the swing as effectively as in every other golf game. There is no 3 click swing option either.While these features are negatives for others, i find this brilliant. It's as close to a real golf game as can be. If you are a real golfer, you will know that golf, is part luck and part experience. In real golf you cannot really control the strenght of your swing, your golf club is designed for a set distance and momentum does the rest. You can adjust your stance and swing to give you an INeffective swing which is then called a chip, punch or a pitch. These types of swings are created by constraining the swing of the club. GC does the same. You cannot see where the ball is going to land IRL, you hope it's going to land where you want it to land, this is what GC does. It's not always possible to have a 100% power on swing in real life, this is what CG does.Now if these are going to change, i would not know, but it sure as hell stops the above avarage scores from happening less than often. Along with the course designer, you will always have to think to play and not run in like a pro and finish 24 below par. The game has some performance issues and there are a few hiccups, hence the ALPHA state. There are however a few recommendations that will turn this into the best Golf game i have played to date. Having a stamina meter or the option to play randomly created golf courses of your friends will really make this one shine.For those seeking something easier, run back to your Mario Golf or PGA tiger woods games and stay away from this one. This is golf....in digital form, so SUCK IT UP and welcome to the real golfer's world.			",145,29,31,25,42,3,28

												“I'm hitting the woods just great, but I'm having a terrible time getting out of them”. ~Harry ToscanoThus an extremely accurate description of my own golf game in real life. Mates good naturedly sledging each other whilst playing a round at the local Golf Course is a strangely relaxing way to enjoy a day. Yep it is a game where “……….. you yell ""fore,"" shoot six, and write down five”. ~Paul HarveyNo longer however, as HB Studio’s has recently released The Golf Club. This is a golf game based on that premise of it is you and your mates playing at your local golf club. There are no licensed courses, and strangely this makes little difference as there are more excellent courses than you will ever be able to play from the 1000’s already available.When playing these courses you will feel like a virtual champion, even by scoring +2 or -8 and for the majority of virtual golfers this will probably be around your score. That is exactly what makes this game so good, yes you will hit drives straighter, but still have your shanks; you will still have some tricky approach shots which at times will make you feel like a hero and other times like you are playing real golf; and the putting in my opinion is the best that has ever been in a golf game. The amount of putts I just miss, genuinely makes me feel like I really am out on the golf course.The graphics are of a very good quality, you will not be disappointed by the look of these courses, though be aware there are a very few, that could make your system of choice chug due to the amount of detail that has been added in. HB Studio’s were on to this quickly though and have now placed a cap on the amount of detail that can be added to prevent this, however there is still plenty of room to create your course rendition.Yes, you have read between the lines well from the odd comments in the last few paragraphs. This golf game also comes with an extremely good course creator. How good, well the Greg Norman design company now use it as a design tool for their clients, and there are many superb user created courses, some of which can be seen here on my YouTube Channel; https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaQ9yFmYtTDa1Ln3hzklh6jeJMPz-m2uBIn conclusion this is a golf game no virtual golfer should be without in their collection. The course designer is worth the price of admission alone and well the game play itself;  “If I had cleared the trees and drove the green, it would’ve been a great shot ~ Sam Snead"", will keep you coming back for round after virtual round.

												This game should not have mixed reviews as it has. It is an excellent game as it is today! Do not be fooled by the vague, ""one dimension of the game earns it a thumbs down"" reviews. Here are some things you need to know before buying it so you do not harp on the game for one single thing. This is a direct x 11 game. If you do not have a compatible graphics card that can play directx 11 games. do not buy this until you do. It says that under recommended hardware  andunder the bare requirements for the game. This game is best played with a controller. It does its best attempt for smart control on a keyboard and mouse but having a controller is should be the standard for you to enjoy the game. This game does not hold your hand.  The game play is a simulation of real golf and this game is a simulator without the licensed pros. They have put so much into the physics of the game that you have to account for the environment as much as the consistency of your fingers playing it. All these people calling it inconsistent are really just having a hard time being consistent operating the controls to the game. It is not the game making the mistakes! This game is unforgiving and if only with the added handicap does it love you. So if you get it, practice, and look at the tutorials on their website explaining golf physics and information in understanding their game. You would realize it was you all along. This is not a simple push a button to hit the ball sort of game. It also does not display the line of trajectory before you hit. This at which I think is amazing. Do you see the line of trajectory of your golf ball before you drive or putt in real life? NO! Can you imagine how boring the leaderboards would be if they held your hand to the top. A popular game called Dark Souls is so popular because of how hard it is. This game is the golf version of that. It is hard and that is why it is fun and also fair. Now with that there are a few things I hope change for the better to make this game even better with some suggeastions. A little more selection in the appearance and attire including colors of the golfers and clothes would be nice. I do not believe female characters tee off at the female tees. Not that they need to, but the ability to do that would be nice. Maybe you could come up with attributes for each person so one players golfer drives further, or pitches better. It seems fake that everyone can carry a ball if they perfectly control it and account for weather, hit 265 yards every time. So maybe have some diversity somehow, which would unfortunately mess with the balance of the game so it is tough idea, but play with it. Just something so that if all things are perfect, we don’t hit the same distance. Right now we have a few avatars who have the same muscle strength.Another feature that would be nice, is if when you are looking for a course to play it would display if you have played it. The game does not immediately display if you have played the course. This game has so many courses and I forget which ones i have played. You have to click on the course and go to leader boards to see what previous score you earned to know if you have played that course. So maybe a quick indicator if you played, maybe even how many times you have played it and maybe even a score display since last time you played it. I know since this is a golf simulator most people would not go play golf when weather is bad and the conditions suck, but maybe you can allow rain and other features. Maybe bring the variable of temperature to the game and how it effects golf ball movement. It wouldn’t be the first time someone coordinated a game of golf with friends and by the time you reach the back nine a storm cloud emerged bringing lightning and thunder or if it is a cold day maybe a little sleet or snow came in with the clouds. Then maybe you can go back to the club and wait (pretty much skip bad weather) on take the challenge of playing in the even worst weather. Now gamers, don’t overreach with this comment that this would mean they have to simulate the golfers health if they get struck by lightning and maybe you should manage hydration and injury or your mood or your golfers social relations because your worried your wife is going to find out your cheating on her ;-) and that will effect your game. I doubt the creators would go so far, but that suggestion of even more varied weather might be a great additional feature. I hope they come up with more game modes to play on, Like foursome, scramble Ambrose, Texas/ Champagne  scramble, skins , greensome, patsome, chapman, better/best ball. The amount of statistics the game provides is phenomenal. Add more if you can.  Like 3 days ago and yesterday stats.The ability to play a course while playing other peoples ghost games is amazing. Also you can play your previous ghost games against yourself. See where you went wrong. Genius!The graphics are phenomenal. This game is beautiful hence direct x 11 requirmentAdd more subtle sound effects. Like a plane going by. Love it when planes go by. A golf course by my house is near a airport and i actually find that sound soothing lol. More ambience sound effects.  Maybe, instead of using the course maker, actually make a driving range or putting, pitching, chipping range. Of course you can do this in the course editor with no tarnishment to your stats, but still. By the way that course editor is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. The amount of options one can take and the amount of courses the community has made is gorgeous. You will almost never have to play the same course twice and if you do, play to beat your own records or beat someone elses. Maybe allow people to make custom clothes and clubs? Anyway, just an amazing game this is. All my suggestions and feedback should not be a list of disappointments the game does not have, but rather a fan boy going far and beyond. Please do your research before buying this game to see if it is for you. They are not falsely advertising the game, you are just lazy. Do your research please! If i think of any other addons, comments for my review I will add it later. Thanks you guys for the great game and I hope you are not done improving it. You have really made something special in this game			",195,17,1,12,25,1,37

												Decent game but needs attention before I would recommend it.The backswing and down swing are way to slow and can really throw your swing (mouse movements) off because of this, also is very hard to have control over how much power is put into each shot. Not being able to move your shot aimer when zoomed down the hole is annoying and not being able to move your shot aimer with your mouse is quite annoying also. Putting can be really difficult when using a mouse.The course editor could use some more basic functions of moving holes and tee's.			",80,5,5,0,4,2,0

												If you're interested enough to be reading these reviews, you'll like The Golf Club. The graphics are pleasant, but not particularly impressive.  The gameplay is more ""sim"" than ""arcade"" style (meaning you can't apply spin to the ball in mid-air). There's no RPG-style player progression or anything like that.  You just play courses and try to improve your handicap. But the game comes with a built-in course designer tool allowing anyone to create  their dream course. And there are *a lot* of very, very, very, *deep breath*, very, very, very good user-created courses out there.Then again, The Golf Club 2 is supposed to come out in 2017, so maybe just wait for that?

												I have not enjoyed a computer golf game so much since I played early DOS versions of Links in the early '90's. Though I played that with a mouse, this game is much more enjoyable for me with a gamepad. I suspect many of the negative reviews about the feel of the game are from people not playing with a gamepad. The negative reviews that talk about the lack of ""leveling up"" and ""improving shots"" are really the greatest strength... you get better at this game by playing and practicing, just like real life. It does take practice, and you get better by playing and learning. Sooo much better than the EA golf games' ""upgrades"", and ""level-ups"".The only negative views I fully understand concern online play and the handicap system. That is truly broken and exploited. But that does not take away from the fact that this is just a fantastic golf sim, with essentially unlimited course options. I would love the option of real world courses and equipment, but even that does not take away from the fact that         this is a fun and relaxing golf game. The course designer is an awesome addition, and it is just fun to play solo, or with friends you know won't cheat the system. I took a chance the last time it was on sale, and liked it so much I went back and bought the collector's edition upgrade to further support the developer. Well worth the price, and I look forward to the next version.			",324,79,33,76,141,7,118

												We all know that putting is 40% of the game. I feel that the grid on the green is hard to guage the direction of the putt along with that glowing gold marker, it would be nice if The Gulf Club would improve the way to direct the golf ball to the cup. I also feel sometimes that the computer is in control of keeping your score at a certain level and not allowing for improvement,  and missed putts will surely do that. I love this game and all the different coarses along with Johns company I highly recommend this game to all the old duffers like me who live and breath golf.

												December 2016. I recommend waiting till it's on sale for $15 or less. In that sense I recommend it.PROS:It's kinda fun if you have enough patience to get decent at the swing mechanics and can overlook the cons.Graphics are adequate I suppose.It's one of the best of the bad selection of golf games on steam.It has course creation.Probably fun with friends.CONS:Sometimes green lines lie! 


YouTube™ Video: 'The Golf Club' hidden green lines!? 

			Views: 51		

			The ball goes left without any slant in the green. How can one ever trust green lines in this game again?		

The swing system isn't the 3-point system. They went out on a limb with this new swing system. Nigh impossible to swing a club at anything other than 100% or 50% consistently. (adjusting ball loft is easy and consistent which helps)The scout cam only shows where the ball would land if you hit the ball normally with 100% swing and default loft. This often makes it difficult to scout the green/green lines. No characters with unique stats. Characters are only cosmetically customizable.Commentator is super annoying after only a few hours of playing. (can turn him off in options)Game has a learning curve with the entire interface. (Especially course creation)Have to waste $10 on dlc to enjoy all the game has to offer.Can't adjust AI skill levels and they will most likely stomp you unless you get birdies every hole.No career mode or sense of accomplishment for doing good besides raising your handicap.

												Picked this up when on sale and it's probably the best golf game on PC currently.There is a learning curve, and i like that. Having to think about club choice taking into account all the variables like the lie, wind and other hazards and having to manage the power of the stroke without a 'power bar' to aid you adds that extra level of skill which i love. The game looks pretty great as well, but there are some occasional visual glitches with the terrain. On my system i had to bring the tree count down a bit, but 60+fps is easy with a gtx 970. The physics seem pretty solid to me as well, although approach shots sometimes seem to roll forever.There are some improvements for issues which in reality boil down to just a lack of polish which i think should be rectified for The Golf Club 2 in 2017:UI - Not too bad visually but not the nicest to navigate intuitively. There should be more search options when selecting courses and a 'played' counter/ filter so you can find courses you've not yet played easily. Player progression - Only limited customisation of a few clothing items. I can understand the lack of player progression as that makes it more like TWPGA games, however i think adding this and more personalisation options such as clubs would add something extra to the single-player mode especially.Sync - When playing with a buddy online there are sometimes issues with what i'm seeing vs what my friend sees, eg. frequently you miss a putt by a tiny amount but it goes in on their screen).Course creator - Because of the UI, designing and building a course takes so long because the UI is a nightmare to navigate. Has potential though.No Windowed borderless mode - lack of is annoying as the windowed mode won't snap to your screen and defaults to taking up half of each screen on a 2 monitor setup, meaning you have to drag it, and tabbing out of game in fullscreen mode makes the game run at <5fps when you come back in.TLDR: Solid golf game, tough but fun and definitely worth buying in a sale. At this point you may as well wait until TGC2. 7.5/10 ",43,4,19,1,15,0,2

												""The Golf Club"" is the most enjoyable computer golf game I have ever played. A 360 controller is a must (do not use keyboard controls) - it was hard to give up the 3 key-click shot (of other games) but I think I like the 360 control better. Play alone, play with others, play with ghost players...it is all good. Typical golf games have limited courses to play; this one has more than you could ever play in a lifetime. The course creator is an awesome tool (a little bit trial & error to learn) but it makes me appreciate the time & effort that went into some of the user created courses.My only minor gripe is the 'tournament' & 'tour' feautures need a little more improvement. The game has a tendency to grade courses as 'easy' (not sure how it calculates that) and the leaderboards can have some mighty low scores - unreachable at my skill level, even after 130 hrs of play).Hope the programmers/creators continue working on this golf game ...or a Club 2, they will have my $upport.

												Having bought ;|The Golf Game'  in February I can only say it's a damn good sim. I played all the TWG and Links many years but this is so far ahead in it's vision, commitment to the community, the constant updating(they listen if it's not working) means I shall be playing this golf game to the excusion of any others.I love the 'no gimmicks' as to setting strengths ets Your own skill is trhe only criteria by which you win or lose. Then the Creation Kit is beyond dreaming. Where else can you design and potter about with a course you've designed  until it's going to meet the standards  other designers test to. Now there are thousands of courses to choose to play . Easy, Medium and Hard.			",9,0,0,2,9,1,8

Early Access Review
								Even from the start of The Golf Club's early access campaign, the player had access to one of the best golf engines on PC since the Tiger Woods franchise stopped being developed for computers. The swing system demands a controller, and if you read the forums, you will see that people trying to use a mouse and keyboard are quite sore over the current implementation. However, with a controller (in my case, the XBox 360 controller for PC,) the swing system is incredibly intuitive and challenging! You never feel cheated off a bad swing, as the stick-based swing reads your pull back and push forward incredibly accurately, and if you fade or draw your shot, you know it was because you did not shoot a good shot! With an analogue stick controller, the swing system is the best, most challenging, but most rewarding golf simulation on PC right now. Note, as a design choice, the developers have already said that they will never develop a 3-click system or a similiar power meter. They feel that their swing system is incredibly important to keeping the simulation feel of the game, and they think that a power-meter system will cheapen the game. Please make note of this, and do not buy this game, if you are expecting a Hot Shots Golf or Mario Golf type system!Aethestically, the game is a bit lacking. The game does not have any real progression for your character - you can play rounds, tours, or other competitions of varying length and difficulty the moment you boot up the game. The challenge comes from the rounds that other players have finished, and you are competing against ghosts of their low scores. This can make the game feel a bit lonely, but they have slowly been adding more functionality in, such as the ability to play your friends live if you both play the same course, and you can even switch on a turn-based system to make it feel like the two (or three, or four) of you are alternating shots. The multiplayer feels a bit patched together and enough features are missing that it still feels a bit unprofessional, but ever since launch they have been fixing bugs and adding new content. Once full-stat tracking goes live, the game will become much more interesting as you challenge your friends in a variety of skills.The game includes a full course editor, and this is incredibly important, as the game ships with only a few courses developed by the dev team. However, playin custom made courses is an absolute breeze. You can view player-made courses just as easily as the developer made ones, and a 0.0-10.0 rating system allows you to mark your favorite courses, and see which tee's the Golf Club community think are top notch. Already there is a wonderfully recreated version of Augusta National, and I'm sure more PGA-tour courses are going to be developed by the community.This is very important as well, as this indie, small-studio game does not have the PGA tour license. There are no professional golfers at all in the game - it instead makes you feel like you are a club or amateur player getting their turns on a huge variety of courses set in a huge variety of difficulty levels. As you get better you can choose to play near impossible courses where the fairways are narrow strips of land between two lakes, or you can choose to hone your short-approach and pitching skills on a variety of par 3 courses. As more high quality replications of real life golf courses are added to the game, you will begin to see a product that more closely resembles the Tiger Woods games of the past. I read that this indie studio was originally contracted out to make the analog-swing stick system for previous Tiger Woods games, and their pedigree at making an incredibly well rounded golf engine shows. However, you can also see that they have very little experience creating the rest of the product. The UI is very minimal, the announcer volume is best turned to 0 after a round or two, and there is almost no flash or style in the presentation itself.Despite this, there are many other benefits than just the solid swing system. There is no loading time between holes once you load the entire course. Like real life, you can see the other holes around you when you're on the course, and as soon as the ball rolls into the pin, you are onto your next drive. They recently made shot adjustments more challenging - in early versions of the game, it would tell you exactly how many feet you were adding onto or off your shot by changing the angle of your shot higher or lower. Now, it only shows a percentage of your full shot power, making the system more challenging and realistic. In the future, I would love to see some official branding, such as official golf clubs, clothing, and other gear. However, I know it is an indie studio, and at the end of the day, they have made an incredibly well rounded golf SIMULATION that is absolutely terrific at doing what it advertises - letting you experience rounds of golf on a near-endless supply of courses. The developers have been constantly tweaking, refining, patching, and adding new content into the game since its early access launch, and despite a few early stumbles, the game seems to be well on its way to being the best golf simulation on PC. If you liked the Tiger Woods games, or if you think you would enjoy a golf game that challenges you to be perfect nearly every shot, like the game does in real life, this is a must-buy for you! Golf fans, please do not sleep on this purchase simply because it doesn't have the pomp that EA golf games have. As the community adds more high quality content and the developers further refine the game, this has the potential to be a long lasting success!As of July 19th, I rate this game an 8.1/10.0Go buy it; I need more friends to compete with!!!

												The Golf Club takes at least a few rounds to get the adjustments just right for your own PC and controls, as do most games.Use the course creator to make your own driving range with a green or 2 to shoot at and replay shots, this gives players a chance to try fade and hook ect and get used to how much roll or backspin there might be with different clubs.Practicing helps a lot, try different shot types around the green and this will help to bail you out of trouble when playing a full round. As in real golf putting is very important, so practice that a lot and check out the videos at HB`s website or Youtube on how to practice and many other tutorials

Once you get in the groove of this game it becomes a lot of fun and a very good golf game, that is still challenging after over 500 hours, many other golf games , I could play almost on remote control , half asleep and still do just as well as the last time, not so in this game.			",35,1,5,1,4,0,0

Cool to have the ability to shape some shots like with spin or hook etc. Like the fact too that you get more penalty when miss thoses shots. Very nice that you can play lefty, i'm righty so i dont care personnaly, but finally ... a golf game with a lefty !! Not too sure about all the tournaments and tour stuff so far, and we badly miss some more entertainment when we play online. It will be nice to have possibiliy to add crowd on the field (like in the old Links LS games).Great Course Designer !  I must go back to work on my baby by the way... need and update ;-)Go on , good game so far !			",18,7,1,3,8,0,9

								Hi.Just a few words about this fine Game Golf Club.So far I have been inpresed by the amount of effort put into the production of this simulator. There seems to be a real fluid movement to the ball and movements of the annimated parts of the game. To date I havent found any other golfing game with such. Although this is the early version with more updates to come. I feel the Golf Club will retain a very high standard thoughout! There are no international coarses in this version so far but for the keen moders out there the Edit part of this programe allows for new coarses to be desighned very easely> So buy and get desighning !!I highly recomend this to all new or veteran Golfers!

												Look at my hours played, well over 1000, so I can't possibly give this game a bad review. I love the game, but it's simplistic, basic, and lacks almost every option you can imagine. I am a casual video golfer, I want to hit most fairways, hit most of the greens and score better than par. It is pretty easy to do that in this game. Read the reviews and System Requirements, this game renders the whole course at once, so no load times between holes, but you need a beefy pc to play it the way it was intended and you MUST have version 11 of Direct X Pros/cons depending on how you look at it:There are basically no options in this game, I don't really ever see many options in its future, it is just a simple golfgame where you can relax and play a round of golf like an average joe on the weekend. Everyone uses the same clubs, you can only drive the ball about 270 yards without wind, but you will get wind as they won't give you the option to play without it.The game currently has over 70 thousand user courses, but not easy searching for the ones you will enjoy playing.The Greg Norman Course Creator is an awesome addition as I enjoy playing a different course every time I play, this is a good thing as very few courses warrant a second play.No lobby for multiplayer, but you can play a friends ghost ball or play a live friend with almost real time results.Putter - Putting feels greatWoods - driving is brainless, you can do it while argueing with the wife, if you can move the control stick backward and then forward you will be a star.Irons - I like themChipping and Flops is probably way too easy for most hard core golf gamers.Rating:Gameplay - 7/10Graphics - 7/10Fun - 8/10Golf Options to make this a great game. 2/10Manual or ingame tutorial - None - 0/10Optimized - Game runs on the Unity Engine, either the engine is weak or a bad choice to render whole course at once or their coders can't optimize it as they seem to dummy stuff down with each new addition, like the engine can't handle anymore or the code is running amok. 3/10I guess this game is a buyer's beware game, you'll either love it or it will run like a 2 legged dog.I really enjoy this game. Yes, I think it could be better with some freakin' Options, but that ain't gonna happen.My overall rating would be 6.5, but I really enjoy this game and I have to play on medium with a Windows7 Home Premium, service pack 1, AMD FX 8120 Eight core processor, 3.10 Ghz, 8Gb Ram, 64bit OS, Nvidia Geforce GTX 560 2 GB card.OK. Now go buy this game, but don't come running to me if it doesn't run on your PC. I am a glass half-empty type person so your mileage may vary.			",108,19,12,3,20,7,4

												A faltering yes.  In regard to PC it is still hard to go past PGA 2008, and The Golf Club unfortunately does not exceed that 6 year old package.  Positives : Equal playing field. No body gets exclusive equipment, putt previews and all that cash content that ruined EA's PGA On line. The swing and putt mechanism are fairly good, and without previews the game is  harder than the last PGA offer.Negatives: Has the feel that it was once intended to be the package to end all packages, then was banadoned, only to be picked up and released with ""what we have to date"".  Like PGA it is a brag session for good players, the scorecards does not list other players at my skill, only the elite. A handicap system would be nice. In trying to implement a  course desginer that works with the dreaded consoles  it has ended up crippling a useful PC one. I am still yet to play with a ""live "" player. The graphics are jerky on a PC. Full HD?  looks no better than past TW PGA releases.All up the price is right, but do not expect cutting edge.			",4,14,0,14,3,0,1

								I'm playing the Early Access version of The Golf Club. What can i say? it plays a very good round of Golf!  Graphically there are obvious similarites to a certain game featuring The Tiger... but thats where it stops. ( same team see ) This is more about a relaxing game of golf, than all those tiresome silly special moves etc.   I also really  like the stand in commentator on this early access version!I believe its one of the developers doing the witty commentary. You should go with him but give him a script! in the finished version. The course content is phenomenal, due to everyone creating courses in the creator. Even if the licence was not available  or the actual real life  course is not in the game, theres always one been created by the community thats very similar.  Online multiplayer , ghosts and leaderboards are all there too. This is going to be such a great game.  The early access version is excellent as it is! so i expect good things when its released everywhere soon. The consoles are getting this game as well. And they do say that all created courses are available to play, on whatever version of the game you own!  so if i made a course on the PC, a console owner could play on it too. Exciting stuff indeed!It reminds me of Tiger crossed with Links Golf.My chosen control method is an Xbox 360 pad by the way. Works very well!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A faltering yes.  In regard to PC it is still hard to go past PGA 2008, and The Golf Club unfortunately does not exceed that 6 year old package.  Positives : Equal playing field. No body gets exclusive equipment, putt previews and all that cash content that ruined EA's PGA On line. The swing and putt mechanism are fairly good, and without previews the game is  harder than the last PGA offer.Negatives: Has the feel that it was once intended to be the package to end all packages, then was banadoned, only to be picked up and released with ""what we have to date"".  Like PGA it is a brag session for good players, the scorecards does not list other players at my skill, only the elite. A handicap system would be nice. In trying to implement a  course desginer that works with the dreaded consoles  it has ended up crippling a useful PC one. I am still yet to play with a ""live "" player. The graphics are jerky on a PC. Full HD?  looks no better than past TW PGA releases.All up the price is right, but do not expect cutting edge.			",4,14,0,14,3,0,1

												playing for a few days now i love golf the games of it and playing it, i think that after a few days i can tell you whatyou need to know about this game as far as if its what your looking for. If your looking for your next tiger woods this is not for you if your looking for skills builder this is not for you if your looking for a game with a Professional mode this is not for you, none of your typical features are in this game, no spin or power boost other than getting better there are no attributes to work on no progression of any kind i can see, no charater creation aside from the colour of the cloths and skin, no club selection everyone plays with the same so if thats what you want you may just wanna wait for the next PGA or tiger from EA but if you want somthing to be like it is on the course and give you the ability to desing your own as unique as you can this is for you. i like this game very good for me but maybe not for you watch gameplay and reviews see for your self			",70,5,0,6,20,1,12

								Have you ever dreamt of what it's like to go outside? Does your mother keep moaning at you, telling you to go out and get some fresh air?  To feel the cool breeze on your skin.  The wind rushing through your hair as you cruise along in a golf buggy across an awe-inspiring vista.  Then look no further! The Golf Club offers all of this and more! (Except it doesn't offer you the chance to cruise along in a golf buggy..)  It is unfathomable how much you can immerse yourself in this game as if it were real life itself.  Download this game and feel your world become overwhelmed in the wonders of golf.  Crack open your window, put your headset on and lose yourself in the majestic prowess that is, The Golf Club.

 Vitality’s S&T ReviewsShort and Tasty… The Bits that matter Short StoryGet your score cards out because this is a HOLE-IN-ONE!OverviewThe Golf Club is a golf simulation video game developed by HB Studios on the Unity game engine. It is a golf sim, boasting a powerful Course Creator based on the procedural generation of courses. The Course Creator can generate a brand new course in seconds which can be shared and played immediately online with friends and other gamers.Vitality’s ThoughtsThese mixed reviews are SERIOUSLY insane! I was very hesitant on actually purchasing, But boy am I glad I did.I'm coming from Tiger Woods 08, And I seamlessly transferred into this modern take on the sport without any issues.People complain about the putting, but again I have no problem with it. Yes it takes getting used too, but come on this is a GOLF simulator, People realise how FRUSTRATING this game can be right ? There's a few negatives I do have with it though, When I play 4 player game modes and we create and edit the player names I would like the system to remember the names I've set for them and there outfits, So We don't have to customise them every few days we are going to be playing. Right now it just defaults them to (Name_1) not the name I've set for them.I also wish I could disable the ball following lines, and also speed up the ball when in mid flight.This game IS GOOD though, I don't think it's exactly worth the $40 price tag, and the way they sell stuff can be a little dodgy, as the season mode is a paid DLC but they're minor, If you can get the game for under $30 it's well worth it.Pros:  Amazing Graphics, Wildlife, And Plants Great Simulation of a frustrating sport Course creation is amazing, You'll never get bored playing the same 10 courses The Commentator isn't generic and annoying like most games Won't cost you $50 for a pack of real balls to lose in the creek Cons:  Player Customisation is limiting 4 Player mode should save custom players Some HUD options for lines etc would be nice Pricing is a little dumb founding. (I believe in DLC, But for Season mode?) ConclusionGreat golf simulator, Probably the best on the market right now, I would highly recommend the game to any avid golfer or anyone who wants to play a golf sim, Don't look at the game though if you're after an arcade Tiger woods though. I'd also recommend the game be purchased under $30, But if you've got the money you won't be  disappointed.79/100 ",201,66,32,15,27,3,7

								Early access game that still needs some work but overall a solid and enjoyable golf game.  While its not a pure sim, it can be challenging.  The Dev team is one of the best I have seen as far as listening and interacting with its community.  If you are a golfer its worth a buy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
