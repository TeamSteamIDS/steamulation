								Surprisingly polished for being in Early Access.  Fantastic local multiplayer game - conceptually, reminds me of classic arena brawlers like Power Stone.  The spell effects are impressive, and the unique twist to each arena adds variety to the gameplay.  My favorite aspect of MageQuit is the physics system, loads of completely unexpected results from various spells clashing - some truly laugh out loud moments can and will happen.  If you’ve got some gamepad style controllers and a few good friends – this could be your jam. Looking forward to future updates from the devs!			",291,80,3,63,31,1,66

								Great Game!  Just sat and played it for two hours straight with 6 friends.  Pretty quick learning curve, so we all sat down and quickly got around to throwing all sorts of spells at eachother.  We used a combination of wired and wireless Xbox360 and XboxOne controllers, worked perfectly.  We enjoyed team matches the most, it was fun to cheer on your teammate when you left him in a 1v3 situation.It's been awhile since I've sat with a group of friends and we all enjoyed a one screen game, MageQuit definitely hit the spot.  Looking forward to what will be coming next in MageQuit!Overall, really liked it.  Good work devs!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Fantastic Game! I've played it a couple times now with 8 or so people and it really is a blast. Local co-op is really where it's at with this type of game (gotta be able to yell at your enemies), but online multiplayer is on the way and i'm looking forward to it.Well polished for Early Access (for all you folks who worry about junk Early Access games, you don't need to fear). Runs well in 4K with an Intel i5-4690K and AMD Radeon Fury Nano. It supports pretty much any modern gamepad you can buy, I've tested Xbox (360 + One), PS4, Gamecube + Mayflash USB adapter, and Wii U Pro + Mayflash USB adapter.			",185,19,3,15,15,2,34

								The game is a lot of fun. I got to play at the release party by the developer. I lost horribly, but loved every minute. Definitely reccomend it to everyone.			",232,82,0,39,35,2,47
