												Monday Night Combat had a nice aesthetic that captured the feel of a sports show, with an intriguingly unnerving game world, and interesting if somewhat flawed gameplay that was at least worth a look.Too bad there is exactly one (1) dedicated server still running.This game was basically a third-person shooter/MOBA hybrid with tower defense elements. (The free-to-play, pay-to-win sequel Super Monday Night Combat - which is currently only slightly less abandoned and which suffered from technical issues - was even more MOBA-like.)Players chose from one of six classes that each played different roles, and money collected on the battlefield or earned from kills could be used to build turrets and upgrade player abilities. The range of mechanics available to the player was a bit confusing for newcomers even if less complex than any actual MOBA, especially when veteran TPS/MOBA players found the game more intuitive.The two main modes were Blitz, which saw you and your team defending your Moneyball against hordes of robots, and Crossfire, which pitted your team against another team in a 6v6 game to destroy the other team's Moneyball with the help of allied robots; more or less DotA as a shooter.The tutorial was basic: it only taught the basics of gameplay and how to play one class. Players had to consult more in-depth guides in order to effectively learn about the game.MNC's world was briefly glimpsed yet revealing: it painted a picture of a totalitarian, consumerist society akin to the Roman Empire that hinted at darker aspects of our own world, where the downtrodden lower classes watched Monday Night Combat for cheap thrills.The game's cartoony graphics weren't so stellar even when maxed out, but they served their purpose, and you wouldn't really have played this for the graphics anyway. Player customization was pretty good though, letting players choose outfits for the classes and pick a title to display gained from completing in-game achievements, such as killing a certain number of enemies. And the characters - the Pros - had some nice diversity going on: a Hawaiian, an African-American, and a woman comprised three of the six characters.Overall, despite some flaws, the game was fun enough to earn a decently sized playerbase back in the day.Okay, you're probably curious about my use of past tense, not to mention my implication that the game is dead. Well...Official servers were shut down in 2012. The playerbase relies on two Steam groups to gather players for matches either on the lone public server or temporary private ones, and you can bet that most of their small number are skilled enough to utterly stomp newer players.There's single-player Blitz available, but there is no single-player Crossfire with AI players, which means that the Crossfire-related achievements are pretty much extremely difficult to get - and are practically no longer attainable without farming. And that's terrible.So what happened to Monday Night Combat?Lack of support is the most obvious problem. Microsoft wouldn't let developers Uber Entertainment update the 360 version, and they ran out of money to keep updating the PC version. The small team of devs had to jump through a lot of hoops just to get the game released. This led to disengagement from the community and an inability to address their concerns.Polygon ran an article[www.polygon.com] that illustrated these problems; it's worth reading if you're curious.Tying into the inability to be engaged with and work on the game, MNC's balance wasn't all that good either from what I can tell. Skilled Snipers and Assaults were difficult to counter. Cheesy tactics abounded, such as excessive use of ricocheting weapons and sniping turrets from outside their range rendering them somewhat ineffective for point defense.The ability for players to supercharge, and the use of what was basically a doomsday weapon located in the center of every arena, meant a losing team could effectively blunt the winning team's progress if they gained the upper hand. Hackers were a problem, the lack of community development tools/an SDK was a different problem; Tanks, Gunners and grapples were borderline overpowered off the bat, while the Assassin was apparently underpowered.The only way you can really play this game now is to gather a group of friends and host your own server. I suppose that since this game originally came out in 2010, it could only have lasted for so long. It's a shame the devs didn't include player AI for Crossfire mode - even with its flaws, that's the one thing that would have ultimately saved this game from its ignoble death.At least Uber Entertainment survived, and would go on to create large-scale RTS Planetary Annihilation - another flawed yet interesting game.The little time I spent with Monday Night Combat was pretty fun, and it certainly had potential. The main menu song was pretty good, at any rate. But I really cannot recommend it.Oh, well. The TF2 promo items were nice.			",195,39,3,14,32,1,35

												Do NOT buy this game nor its free pay-to-play counterpart, Super Monday Night Combat. The developer, Uber Entertainment, has abandoned support for this game for more than a year; not officially, mind you, but dead silence on anything from the company on the MNC/SMNC front as they are concentrating support on another game of theirs.While this is a fun, balanced 3rd person MOBA, mixing Team Fortress 2 and DOTA, as well as being one of the few games that is not only ACTUALLY hilarious, unlike other games where the jokes are funny once and never again, this has such an extensive library of well-written lines, it is sad that the developer decided to sabotage the game for a quick buck via the F2P & in-game store model. Save your money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A simple fast paced team based shooter with moba like elements, pick from one of 6 classes each with their own unique skills and abillities. All classes have their strengths and weaknesses each with their own personality. Monday Night Combat is my favourite game on steam and always will be! Unfortunately the games playerbase is very limited, but with the help of the MNC community games are organised regularly. So don't threat too much about never being able to play. The commentator of the game spews out hilarious dialogue about your situation and the teams performance, the game even has a mascot that appears on the field that you can shoot for money and prizes!Join the ""hotshotsforever"" group on steam to inform you of organised events.Did I mention MNC is the most lethal sport of the future? ;)Hiyo! 10/10! Oh!... And theres bacon!			",403,81,13,44,14,5,30

 There is a warning at the bottom of this review, I reccomend you read it after the rest of the review before purchasing.tl;dr: Amazing, funny, fun team based third person shooter with minor MOBA elements that's saddly very, very dead currently. If you have friends and they're all willing, it's a fantastic game though.I'll say this now, the original Monday Night Combat is one of my favorite games of all time.It's a class based, PVP/PVE, team centric third person shooter set in a hilariously dark (but never seen) dystopian future where you compete as a group of clones fighting in a lethal sport in specially made and company branded arenas. Got all that? Oh and there's also upgrading skills, bacon, a mascot you shoot to get money, dual miniguns, half of the classes have jetpacks, light tower defense mechanics, taunting is a way you earn money AND a sexy mascot who's also the one providing you turrets?There's light twinges of MOBAs in Monday Night Combat, but if that makes you cringe from past experiences with MOBAs, set it aside because everything is easy enough to understand and nowhere near as punishing as your typical MOBA.The game plays like this: There are two teams, with ""bases"" on each side of the symmetrical map, each base has several spots where you can place turrets and a ""money ball"" to defend with its own shield which has to be destroyed for the other team to win. Each base also spawns bots (which can be killed to get cash)Act, which meet at the middle of the map and clash, but without players helping them out, they won't get far. The trick is that each money ball has a shield, one that can only be broken if a friendly bot reaches the enemy money ball. There's also the hilarious narrator who gives details about the setting and comments on how well you are playing. He doesn't really ever get old.There's also a lot more I could talk about, like custom boost loadouts to be unlocked, each class has its own spawn-able bot type, chickey cantor... I could go on forever but I'll try to make this review short-er.The good: It's funny, it's REALLY fun to play, it has a fantastic visual style, and the balancing is very good for the most part. It's just... really, really good. Also Chickey Cantor... gotta add at least a whole point on the review score for having a giant robotic chicken.The bad: (Mostly nitpicks) Parts of it haven't aged so well, such as parts of the gunplay. The balance isn't perfect as that a few clases in the right hands can almost steamroll such as The Support and The Sniper. Losing isn't very fun, and sometimes you can get stuck in a losing game without much way of getting back up due to some bad investments. It's overall a fantastic game.HOWEVER, WARNINGHere's where the sad part of the review comes in... right now the multiplayer community is, except for a few groups who meet occasionally, pretty much dead. If you're wondering about my hours played being something like 1.6 or 1.9, it's because most of this game I played on the Xbox LIVE version, which had fewer maps and costumes but was still the same damn game you can buy here, and feels great with and without a controller. There's also Super Monday Night Combat, the Free 2 play ""sequel"" is available, which more or less dumbed down the importance of the shooty bits and made it feel a bit more like a typical MOBA, but also added a whole new roster of characters and another announcer that makes it twice as funny as the original MNC. It's also dead, but you can unlock items for TF2 and vice-versa. As for this game... most of what you can do now is join groups like  Hotshots Forever . Sad to see such a good game go.

												This game was amazing! Back when it had players, at least. Sadly, the already-struggling game was killed when Uber decided to release Super Monday Night Combat, which was then killed off as well.I wish this game were still alive. If it were, there'd be reason to play it. There's none, now.EDIT: I should probably add this to the review: There is still a group on steam that plays the game, but don't expect to see more than one server with people on it -ever- (and I love this group for that, I missed this game so badly), and don't expect to see even that 80% of the time.

												This game is dead, with only one server active that is empty. That being said, if you buy this game during the sale and persuade a few friends to buy it too, you could have a bit of fun with this game. During its peak, this game was a very popular and fun game however I didn't play the MNC series in it's prime so I never truly got to learn this game or SMNC, and am stuck with the blitz mode on this game. The Blitz mode, like SMNC can be played solo though at least, and I prefer the Blitz mode on this version as it feels way more relaxed and is a nice way to chillax and get rid of stress.In conclusion, if you are looking for a multiplayer game to drop in and drop out of if you have no friends to play it with, then this game is not for you. However, when the game is on sale and your friends are willing to buy it to play with you, i'd say it is still worth the sale price despite being completely dead. Also the Blitz mode was worth the sale price in my opinion.			",240,29,6,6,11,5,12

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.Monday Night Combat is a multiplayer shooter game that incorporates shooter mechanics, tactical tower defense mechanics, and fun mechanics into one package. So did this bizarre mix of mechanics work to the game's benefit or did it just end up being too much for one little game to take in.Monday Night Combat may be a small game, but it was able to take in a deep breath and work the air through its system smoothly allowing for an entirely new take on multiplayer shooters.Overall: Monday Night Combat is an enjoyable and unique multiplayer shooter that incorporates a whole lot of different mechanics into a little game. The end result is an engrossing and highly addictive experience that makes it all the worthwhile to explore the depths of indie multiplayer games.			",1949,754,75,171,243,17,313

												Super Monday Night combat replaced this, basicaly going from traditional development to wacky Freemium buy our♥♥♥♥♥♥frenzy.Uber's reluctance to just say they lied about ever doing a map maker for the community was the final nail in its coffin. Don't buy it. Don't touch their other one either unless you want to waste time in a largely dead game, because surprise, they couldn't manage this one, they definately couldn't handle the Dota like.If this was on sale for a dollar, I'd light that dollar on fire and get more enjoyment then out of this dead neglected game.Thanks Uber, You made a fun game, killed it, replaced it with something similar but more money grubbing, and killed that too.If you are going to make something for PC, make it for PC, don't pander and try to maximize profits under the guise of understanding PC players.

												This game is a ton of fun.It's set in a gameshow in the future where you play as a contestent (one of 6 classes --> Sniper, Support, Tank, Gunner, Assault, Assassin).  There are 2 modes crossfire (PvP) and Blitz (Co-op).  Crossfire is the mode that I play the most.  Basically it's a 6 on 6 arena where your goal is to get your team's bots past the enemy's turrets in order to take down their moneyball.  Once the moneyball's shields are down, you can attack it.  Lots of strategy is involved though due to the varying skills that each of the classes come armed with.  You'll need to take out enemy players, enemy bots and enemy turrets before you can get your bots in.  There are environmental hazards you can use to your advantage, you can upgrade yourself in-game, you can buy/upgrade turrets, and you can even purchase additional bots to come help you out.I highly recommend this game, but do be forewarned that the player-base is currently pretty small.10/10			",417,68,14,32,21,0,41

												This game had a lot of potential. It was fun during the summer event for a few days when there were tons of players of all skill levels. I really enjoyed it at first.Not many maps or modes. Hardly any players on now. If you do find a populous server, chances are, you'll be playing against veteran players. I hope you enjoy players constantly giving themself full HP or freezing you to no end or being showered with explosives spam. The assassins are pretty easy to take care of, though. I'm just a touch from level 10, so maybe I haven't fully experienced what the game has to offer. With the way things are, I've lost all interest in doing so.I'm sure the game is very rewarding for those who've spent countless hours mastering the game with its miniscule amount of maps and modes.

												This game is AMAZING.I originally purchased it on Xbox 360 back in 2010 after I fell in love playing the trial version. (This was back when people actually played the game, and the servers weren't totally dead.) I think that was when the MOBA craze was just taking off, but this did something original with the formula that I hadn't seen anywhere before... It's a class-based shooter like TF2 but the game plays like League of Legends -- you protect your home base's ""crystal"" from the opposing team's minions (all different kinds of robots, in this case). What makes this formula even more interesting is that your ""towers"" (turrets) are selected and upgraded by YOU and your team using the ""gold"" you get from killing the enemy team and their minions. And to top this all off, it has a crazy, silly, cartoony atmosphere and art style, and it acts like it's a reality game show/sport (hence the title), complete with a witty announcer.I picked up a 4-pack for super cheap a few months ago to share with friends, but... Sadly, since no one really plays it anymore, all you're really left with is the 1-4 player ""tower defense"" co-op mode -- you choose your turrets to defend against waves of the different kinds of robots and defend your crystal.Eventually, they released a sequel in 2012 (Super MNC), but it was a free-to-play, microtransaction mess only available on PC. It was awkward and boring with none of the charm of the original (read: hat simulator), and I don't think anyone plays that anymore either.Really, MNC is the predecessor to the likes of Smite, Minimum, and Orcs Must Die: Unchained... If you can pick this game up for a buck or two, maybe you could get some friends together to play it, even if it's just the co-op mode. Sure, you didn't get to play it in its heyday, but you still get to play something different.			",499,106,7,26,19,4,41

												This game is so much fun. Back when it was released on Xbox 360 Arcade, so many people jumped into this game and it was a HUGE success. Sadly, Uber Ent went and forgot about the Xbox 360 community and gave more attention to the PC version. They gave us only the Spunky Cola special DLC but never gave us the Uncle Tully's map and other DLCs they said we'd get. Eventually, they abandoned MNC on both sides, PC and Xbox and decided to make Super MNC. Community responded by not supporting Super MNC like they were hoping us to. Instead we enjoyed MNC for a much as would could until it slowly withered away.Currently, this game is dead. The game itself is fun if people decide to jump in again and play. If Uber Ent would just drop the price of $5 and make it Free to play and just add some skins to customize your appearance WHICH DOES NOT ADD ANY STATS BOOSTS AND IS SOLELY FOR COSMETIC PURPOSES! Then they can get some money and MAYBE the community will slowly begin to revive itself. If you and some friends would like to play this game together and against each other for fun and laughs, go for it. They do have a co-op mode called Blitz. Blitz is pretty much a survival mode where you survive wave after wave of bots and you need to protect the Money Ball from getting destroyed. Blitz can be played offline. Crossfire is the multiplayer mode, it can be played offline but splitscreen, no AIs are allowed in this game for either game mode.Hope this information helps anyone decide whether they want to spend money and try the game with friends, or wait until if it ever goes Free to Play.PS: I barely have hours on here because I mainly played back on Xbox 360 back in it's glory days.

												A bit of a let down, personally. I heard great things about the cool, DOTA inspired modes, but that stuff doesn't seem to really have much effect on the actual game. The action isn't as tight as TF2, and the turrets just seem sort of useless. Not a horrible game, but I wouldn't pay $15 bucks for it if I hadn't already. Might be worth it when it's on sale for $5.			",489,76,6,81,66,5,102

												I'm afraid I can't recommend this game any more. Not because it's bad; it's an amazingly fun multiplayer game that's a sort of hybrid of the best aspects of MOBA and shooter. It's just that nobody plays it any more; the entire remaining active community has congregated to 2 groups of fewer than 300 members, neither of has posted much of anything within the last three months as of this edit. You may be able to have fun with this game's sequel, Super Monday Night Combat, but that game's much more of a MOBA than this one was.Original review below.What is it? Not TF2!What's it like? TF2!No hats or free-to-play. There's a title system but it hasn't affected anything so far as far as I can tell.			",901,326,38,153,101,11,193

												Seriously, what a waste of 15 dollars. Next to no one plays this online and without bot support for Crossfire matchs you're stuck with a crappy tower defense mode to play offline. The gameplay is only fun when you are matched up with players of similar skill and when the game isn't lagging hella bad. Sadly, the only people who still play this trash are 200x your level, so don't expect to win often.			",124,11,1,12,5,1,5

I recall first playing this game when it first came out & they promoted Free Play - and the servers were alive.  They added a League-of-Legends like map that I was hoping to catch in live-action, but again - the servers are dead.If you like playing tennis with yourself; that is, you hit the ball hoping someone or something will hit it back to you - this games for you.

												I bought this game for about 10 bucks (one copy for a friend of mine, one for me), expecting it to be a great co-op and PvP game, after reading the glowing reviews and the way it is advertised on Steam.What can i say? Don't bother. There's a good game in there but you can hardly play it. The first thing i noticed were input and settings related bugs. Then crashes. But worst of all, no servers and the inability to actually create a co-op room and invite you friends (remember, it was advertised to have this feature).If you're lucky, you may still find a dedicated server, which most likely will be empty. If you create your own lobby, you will be unable to invite your friends and your friends won't be able to see it in the server browser (we tried it, multiple times and with multiple settings/solutions).The only way to play this online, is to get into one of the two empty servers i have found and let your friend join them too. The downside is, you can't select the game mode or map and you most likely end up in opposing teams (1vs1 basically).It's a shame, really, because the game itself promoses to be fun. I don't care if this was released on 2011. It's still sold and advertised on steam and i expect the advertised features to work. It may be ""just"" 10 bucks, but i want it back anyway.This game is the straw that broke the camel's back and i will refrain from buying anything on steam for a while.			",94,4,2,5,3,2,5

												I would like this game a lot more if there were people online to play with. But maybe I'm on at the wrong times. I dunno. Point is, it gets old just playing with Computers all the time. That being said, I'm still gonna recommend this game. The mode I always somehow end up playing is the one with robots. It's as if TF2's Mann vs Machine got refined and got some more modes of game play. For those of you not familiar with what I just reference, Mann vs Machine is a mode in TF2 where you battle robots of varying classes and once defeated drop money. If you successfully complete all 7 waves, you can then take the cash they drop to fund upgrades for whatever class you are playing. So the fact that this game is completely different but feels like another, I find very cool. Also, maybe I'm just playing this game wrong. You can tell from my logged hours I don't play much so I may be missing a lot. But if I can find a server with actual people playing, I'd be more likely to play more. But it seems I'll be waiting forever..  ",291,151,3,49,36,4,35

												On prend un tower defense on y ajoute des éléments de gameplay propre à Team Fortress 2 y comprit le coté ""stylisé"" et on obtient l'un des meilleurs titres, ressemble fortement a Star Wars Battlefront dans des arenes plus petite.Deux camps s'opposent, le but est de détruire la ""Money-Ball"" de ses adversaires, qui se situe au sein de leur base. Vous contrôlez un personnage, choisi parmi 6 classes et qui doit à la fois repousser les assauts des ennemis et attaquer leur base. Des vagues d'unités contrôlées par la machine sont là pour vous aider et vous pouvez également placer des tourelles défensives.En réalité il s'agit d'un tower defence ce voulant dynamique ce qui est plutôt un bon point pour ces jeux où l'on est souvent spectateur, mais en regardant de plus près on peu ce rendre compte qu'il vaut vraiment le détours.16/20			",378,68,11,30,5,2,24

												[The game is dead now, don't buy it]It may be a fun game, but I don't recommend buying it. According to the achievements, around 40% of the people who own the game can't run it or haven't even played a single round. Plus, the game's popularity dropped to nothing just two weeks after its release. I have 41 out of over 100 friends who own the game, and none have played the game in the last two weeks. Also, only one has played more than 50 hours.I've yet to play more than two rounds of MNC myself, due to incompatibilities with my computer...I'd like to play, and if I could, I would play it occasionally, but that won't be happening anytime soon. :(			",221,44,8,16,13,1,45

												This is a good game with a pro game feel (even if undeserved, I don't know because I stopped playing after a few weeks.) However, for whatever reason, it has died. There are no more servers. The only way you could reliably play is if you were to play with all people you knew. Dont' get the wrong idea, single player can still be fun when you need a heart-pounding time waster. However, if you want to see how you match up to everyone else, dont' expect to be able to. They made a free to play version which flopped and now neither ever see the light of day. I fully blame the free to play. This version has been fixed and balanced out and deserves more attention. Don't expect Uber to fulfill promises about it. Don't expect anything you don't like to be fixed. Expect to have fun with friends but not on public servers. Until public servers become full again, it's not worth the investment. Also, don't encourage SMNC either.			",107,49,1,13,4,2,3

												At first this seemed like a really interesting mesh between the Tower Defense and Class FPS genres. However it soon becomes just more of the same shadowed by the TF2 giant.Right now it's pretty much dead considering the developers threw it into the garbage and released a freemium ""sequel"" with far more support. Tried the sequel for a bit but it still holds the same core problems. Just introducing new classes isn't enough if they're never truly engaging, which in a game like this is the big difference between staying or moving on forgetting the announcer voice, which was pretty much the only thing worth relating to...

												It'd get a thumbs-up: but Uber Entertainment has ditched MNC for Super Monday Night Combat, which then flopped about helplessly thanks to a Free To Play setup and being dropped like an ugly baby by Uber Entertainment not long after its conception.Both games are dead and I'm writing this review purely to get it out of my system:MNC *was* fun, had its fixable flaws, but then it got stabbed and left for dead in an alleyway.

												Monday Night Combat is possibly the best example of western consumerism you'll ever see. After all, who else would knock down the Great Pyramids because they'd ""gone out of style""?Monday Night Combat pits two teams (The Hotshots and the Icemen, who are Orange and Blue respectively) against each other in a battle to look cool as ♥♥♥♥. 6 different Pros are selectable, ranging from the executively cool Assault, who advises you to step aside due to his large step-taking, to the mentally deranged Sniper, who will more than likely want an official review on every kill that isn't his. Also in the playing leagues are bots, ranging from the Slim, a small, easy to destroy robot, to the Bouncer, a heavy, gorrila like bot that will easily turn Pros into Mash. Also on the playing field after being banned for 10 seasons is the JACKBOT XL, a heavy robot that only wants a cuddle but ends up killing those he attempts to cuddle.Please note: Not restricted to Monday.

												It may bear a resemblance to Team Fortress 2 at first glance, but it's really not all that similar. It is class based and has a similar art style, but that's about it. Monday Night Combat is really a hybrid between a third-person shooter and a tower defense game, and the mix works very well. It has an exaggerated TV sports presentation that is equal parts cool and hilarious, and leaves me fondly comparing it to Smash TV. Most importantly, it's a lot of fun.

												Surprisingly fun for a $15 game; It's got 6 classes, and games mostly operate as a mixture of Tower Defence, Unreal Tournament 3, and Team Fortress 2.Singleplayer consists of just tower defensing, whereas multiplayer splits 12 players into 2 teams of 6, each with a ""tower"" to defend, and unlimited bots. Each team can build towers or buy more bots. Sadly, hardly anyone is playing the co-op portion of the game (there was maybe 12 local servers, with half being passworded last I checked). Co-op is the same gametypes as singleplayer (tower defense with x number of waves, or unlimited waves).Some parts of the game seem a bit unbalanced perhaps, but they don't subtract from the overall experience; my biggest complaint is that there is only about 4 multiplayer maps.
