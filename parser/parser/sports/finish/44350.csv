												I really like GRID 2 and I think it's the best racing game on Steam. Just keep in mind that it's not a racing simulator like GRID. It's Need for Speed: Greatest Hits. I can see huge chunks of various NFS games put into the game nicely like Touge on the California Dixon track at night is a canyon race from Carbon, sponsor decals, body and performance mods are from Underground, circuit races strongly remind me of ProStreet. Cote d'Azur track alone reminds me of Porsche Unleashed and brings a smile to my face. Codemasters made a great arcade racing game.Strong sides of the game: gorgeous graphics, awesome physics in terms of car behavior, great online matchmaking, single player campaign is fun to play and interesting to progress, AI can be easily adjusted to a desired difficulty.Minor complaints that I have: there's no way to change the in-game assistant's voice. Personally I really dislike that voice and ended up muting it. Many games have an option to change the voice that talks to you while you play 'cause it's important! You're stuck with this voice for hundreds of hours. In Crysis I was able to choose the voice of the nanosuit (male/female/robotic), in SR: TT and many other games there're similar options. The DLCs certainly crippled the game. Extra tracks and cars just don't fit in properly, e. g. you can't use Ford Sierra RS500 online and nobody races on Bathurst unless you create a custom lobby and invite friends to play it. The lack of cockpit view is an insult. I also miss Ferrari, Lamborghini and Porsche cars, but don't get me wrong, there's a lot of cars to play with.			",537,117,29,69,43,5,78

												I got this game on sale, and I wanted to like this game, I really did. I loved the first GRID. The graphics are really nice, among the best for a racing game when it came out. The single-player story mode is cheesy, but it does okay to fill the gaps between races. The engine sounds are mostly accurate, far more so than the first GRID game. It's really unfortunate that this is where the good parts of the game end.The driving physics are awful. Literally some of the worst I've ever played. I understand they wanted to focus on drifting and making it a key component of racing, but it is so poorly implemented that certain vehicles are essentially unplayable. Driving the Koenigsegg Agera R is a nightmare... it feels exactly like driving on ice, which I have actual experience with, living in a place that gets really cold during the winter with tons of snow. It's really a shame that ALL of the cars drift. All of the vehicles, regardless of being described as ""Balanced"" and / or ""Grip"" when you select them, will drift, no matter how perfect you try to take a corner. As soon as you hit the brakes, you can feel the vehicle start to fishtail. Some cars are okay, but I've found at least 50% of the time, racing is just not an enjoyable experience.Even worse is the computer AI. They drive their line and regardless of if they hit a wall, if you bump them, and even if you try to spin them out, it's nearly impossible, they do not make mistakes. It feels exactly like a crappy simulation, minus actually simulating anything.I did enjoy the first 18 hours or so in the single-player game. Really the coolest part of the game was my second race when I drove up the side of a mountain, fell back down on top of the opponent's car, and still won the race. However, after over 21 hours, I've finally put my controller down in frustration, and most likely will not pick it back up for this game.			",68,18,3,5,5,1,5

Before I proceed to the review, you should know that personally I'm racing games addict and cars lover from kid. You should know that I raced in many online leagues in reputable simulator: rFactor - it could have been even 800-1000 driven hours. You may ask ""why have you stepped back to GRID?"" - it's simple: I don't have time for preparations to compete in online leagues (1 race = whole week of training).Here's where the GRID2 steps in!HistoryGRID2 is the successor of Race Driver: GRID released in 2008, and it represents the same idea.. but somehow better. At first I need to refer into the roots of the first part of GRID - do you remember a game series called TOCA Race Driver? If not, Codemasters produced that series between 1997 and 2006. Because the sales were dropping, Codemasters decided to abandon TOCA and introduce new brand referring to the old product - Race Driver: GRID. I've personally played TOCA Race Driver 3 and I remember that game featured races not only in sportscars but also Monster Trucks and some motocross ones. It was therefore not only asphalt oriented races like the new GRID series. The success of Race Driver: GRID was an indicator to create a new game as GRID2.SingleplayerIn GRID2 you become professional racing driver from rookie just like in Race Driver: GRID. Your first race at Chicago circuit is the tutorial one before you become part of the WSR league (World Series Racing). After first race you're heading into your racing garage. The game features of a manager helping you to start your career. The campaign is very interesting because you start it from the rookie point of view: slow cars (Tier 1). Interesting thing introduced in GRID2 is that after every race you're not rewarded by money. You're rewarded by the number of fans that you got by completing the race. The game makes you feel like you're really important driver in that league. After a couple of races and challenges you need to complete the final one to get into higher tier. Every new tier brings new tracks from all over the world, game modes and of course new cars. Finishing the campaign on the difficulty set to high with all the achievements (50/60 without the DLCs) took me about 30-40 hours of playtime.Features* Game modes: Race, Elimination, Checkpoint and Faceoff.* Retrospection - the feature known from Race Driver: GRID, gives you the ability to rewind the time and correct your mistakes* There are some tracks based on the real life circuits like: Algarve, Red Bull Ring, Abu Dhabi and there are many configurations of the tracks* Cars are well balanced with their advantages and disadvantages measured on different tracks* Anti-cut-track system which gives you penalty (stop/go) for cutting the track* You can always change the difficulty and damage level* If you set the damage level to the highest, you can end up the race for example on the wall very easily* Very good graphics engine and optimalizations (playable on nVidia 9600 GT)* Nice destruction model and detailed statistics about your driver's career like in Race Driver: GRIDPhysicsThe game physics is demanding and the tracks are very well made with bumps and kerbs affecting the stability of the car. You can't set the details of the physics like traction control or ABS cause the physics is simplified. You need skills to control the situation all over the time. If you make a mistake, you pay for it. The physics gives slight advantage to those who oversteer the car in turns and drift while the FWD cars don't understeer as they should. You need to remember that the grip is changing depending on the surface. I would rate the physics as 70% arcade 30% simulation.MultiplayerAlive with many players as it's the extention of singleplayer mode. There are some moments where there's nobody to play with but that's a rare situation. The MP is hard because you start with the basic cars good for some tracks but bad for others. You need to race in order to receive money and buy better cars. Buying new cars isn't the end of story because afterwards you can modify them (of course by paying money). In the DLCs there are some paid cars that make the competition a little bit unfair. For example Mitsubishi Evo X is probably the best drift car in the game, better than the free ones. The anti-cut-track system is not perfect in some situations because there are places where huge cutting (cheating) won't give you the penalty. It's also popular that the penalized driver (stopped for a couple of seconds) does a very bad thing to others: he directs himselft on the path of incoming opponents to caught them on his bumper. It's also reffering to the culture of players because some of them race only to eliminate others, but it's better than it sounds :)ControllersI've tested the game on keyboard and externals: controller Logitech F310 and wheel Logitech G25. The controllers are well discovered and set perfectly. Some cars like Koenisegg are created to be the fastest and hardest so even on the wheel there's a lack of grip on that car and losing control. In general I can tell you that the cars from Tier 4 can be handed perfectly only on the wheel but I disliked doing it in MP.Drawbacks and issues* Anti-cut-track bugs on some tracks* Lack of cockpit camera which was in the Race Driver: GRID* Lack of the option to change the degree lock for wheel* Lack of balancing feature in MP - players are always mixed with different level and skill.* The serious issue I have is: problem with not saving the options to the configuration file (it's locked all the time so I can't even read it). I need therefore to change the graphics options everytime I run the game while there's no problem with the settings of controller (they are in different file). I got used to it but I have the same issue in Race Driver: GRID so maybe it's Windows 8.1 related issue.SummaryTo sum up the review, in my opinion GRID2 is worth the money. It provides a lot of fun both in singleplayer and multiplayer and on every controller. To this day I still enjoy the multiplayer and I was also invited to drive for one of the Polish leagues - Goes Like Hell. I don't treat it seriously cause I play GRID2 for chillout, but it's the next challenge for me and possibility for players to spend here many more hours.Race Driver: GRID or GRID2?The 1st part is a little more like simulation so my advice would be: enjoy your playtime at first in Race Driver: GRID and when you'll finish it, buy GRID2 :)Game tested on:AMD Phenom II X4 945, Nvidia 9600, Windows 8.1			",680,186,53,71,57,8,88

												I want to clear up that im not going to include Grid 1 to this review. Gameplay on the tracks are mainly based on acrade style racing. Its all about investment in a new league of sport and becoming the number #1 contender and the number 1# fan.What I like about Grid 2 are the tracks. They are fun and challenging to race on in career mode and online. The car personaliztion is near enough good, throwing in real life sponsors to put onto your car and personalize. I was disappointed with the physics in use of the cars as the developers focused on the powersliding instead of clean turn exits to build better momentum through the corners. You may think thats essential for a great game but the handling will lead you to wreckless driving in most modes challenged on. Online as an example is almost unplayable for these reasons because players cant take full stable control around the corners for a clean race. Another thing I was disapointed in was the input controls on the game. For a controller it wont be much of a problem driving cars but for keyboard users it will be. Most racing inputs ive used was the simple w,s,a,d & (Arrows) and have no issues playing them smootly. For Grid 2 its difficult as its not keyboard friendly in a way of keeping your car stable around the corners and attempting most clean races. Ive tried both controller (F710)  & keyboard and its a major difference how you perform in the game.Cockpit is not required in the game which is another downside for a latest racing release. DLC packs have been scattered around as typical developers want more money off you. Pros:+ Tracks to drive on+ PersonalztionCons:- Controls are unstable- Not Keyboard friendly compare to most racing games- No Cockpit- Codemasters greedy DLC Schemes- Graphics are not as good for its ageMy rating: 65/100Metascore rating: 80/100Conclusion:I dont reccomend this game full price for the aspects ive pointed out from it. If steam provide a discount give it a go and see what you think. Hope you make the right decision on purchasing the game.			",45,0,5,2,1,0,0

												This game is no simulator, and i've only played with gamepad. After 7 hours I have to say i'm disssapointed, coming from GRID 1.The game now focuses on city circuits with different gamemodes (Elimination, circuit changes on the go...) and doesn't focus on real competitions like the first one no Open wheel/DTM/GT/LMP classes of events and no Lemans Resistance races when the season ends. In 7 hours i've only visited 4 circuits so far, with no serious competition on them (just regular races, with different car classes on the same race), and the handling i'd say is a bit worse than on the first, with they wanting you to drift in every corner.The plot of the game is to make a new series of racing globally, taking the best drivers of each part of the world. in each part of the world there are different gamemodes. (guess what: in japan they drift)The game also feels like it puts together different vehicle classes and they more or less perform the same (Chevrolet Camaro against a Alfa Romeo 4C comes to mind)And the whole point of 'we have to get fans from social networks to talk about us' with the TV show stuff (The game's storyline, i'd say) just feels for 12 years old. I'd say they wanted to make the game easier for younger people. I really liked GRID 1, but this one is average, shouldn't call itself GRID.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like games like Burnout and Need 4 Speed. You might like this game. If you're expecting an experience along the lines of something like Forza or GT look somewhere else.   I myself can't hate this game enough. I hate everything about it. Codemasters feels the need to infuse GRID and DIRT with this huge amount of 'bro talk', MT DEW and fake pop culture. Which really just makes me sick. It's insulting. The track line up is laughable as well. I can't think of anything positive to say about this game besides it's not for everyone. Some out there will find GRID 2 to be just what they need. The Burnout, and Need 4 Speed type of players. Nothing wrong with that.  I simply hate this game. The original GRID was so much more enjoyable and I was hoping to find that with GRID 2. That enjoyment was nowhere to be found for me.			",106,14,12,18,10,0,16

												This review is focused on the singleplayer aspect of this game.Pros:- Fairly nice to look at- Good sound design- Bathurst- Decent length careerCons:- Handling inferior to the original GRID- I have seen better AI in N64 racing games- AI vehicles are also far stronger than player vehicle, which causes trouble with the high likelihood of AI colliding with player- Rubbing against a wall while turning a corner may result in a sudden outbreak of the Flips- No longer has the 'build your own racing team' style of the original, which I feel makes the game less appealing- Have to pay extra for Bathurst (and on that note, there is quite a catalogue of DLC which indicates that a decent amount of content was cut from the game for DLC, the same problem was had with DiRT 3.)This is not really a bad game. However, it is inferior to its predecessor- your money would be much better spent on that.Still could be worth picking up on sale if you are a fan of the series though.			",190,23,13,28,17,3,44

												Game is good but i don't recommend it for a few reasons unless it's on sale or you can get it from a trader:_ ""Racenet"" If you want to do the global challenges or fully enjoy the multiplayer experience you need to have an account, like the rival thing. I thought your Steam friends are your rivals but no no, only racenets friends are your rivals._ DLC you have not many cars unless you buy the dlc, also some circuits are only available after you buy overpriced DLC (5$, 6$, 10$)_ Your car is made of ♥♥♥♥ing polysteren when your opponents car are made of titanium. Ram them while taking a turn you fly away, stick behind them but keep accelerating you'll go at their speed and they wont even flinch. If they ram you during a turn you can be sure you'll loose control of your vehicle. If they're behind you pushing and you try to slow down or break you'll loose control, if you keep at your pace the back of your car will go sideways until you loose control. Driving a muscle car and getting hit by a roadster still makes you fly + damage your vehicle. _ Drift cars, the worst thing in this game and there's plenty of race to do with these. The cars keep oversteering._ Pinball effect, if you hit a wall you'll bounce on the ramp on the other side of the road._ Sometimes if you're against the wall and hit a cone your car will explode._ Opponents are driving at your speed, if you're slow they'll be slow. If you're ahead of them they'll catch up with you no matter how perfect you're racing._ Except for you there's never any crash, if you're causing a pile up you'll be the only one ending up off road. The opponents will follow their racing lanes no matter what's happening ahead.I think that pretty much sums up why i can't recommend this game, maybe these seem like small things but when every races you're the only one loosing control (and not just a little) once there's frictions between you and your opponent that you have to restart or  go back in time every time it gets irritating.About the good things of this game?_ Graphics are pretty neat_ Different kind of events (Touge, Race, Time Attack, Drifts, Endurance, Takeover etc)_ Car customisation_ Decent career mode.

												Bought this game because I was a huge fan of the first game. I've been disapointed with this one. The graphics are improved and the damage model is still excellent. My problem is the handling and physics of the game. They just seem off. I spent most of the time starting out only drifting around turns (I hate drifting). Once I got it more figured out it got better but is still disapointing. Also not to mention that there is a lack of a cockpit view in the game. I got this game on summer sale for a great price and still feel like a wasted my money. There are better racing games out there if you are interested in buying one. I don't recomend this one unless you want to give it a try and don't have to spend much money on it.UPDATE: So I don't believe many people realize what I'm trying to explain. So let me go into some more details. The game is beatuiful, amazing in looks. The damage looks real and the system for the career looks like it's great and laid out very well. The handling of the cars is what really turns me off from this. It's a cross between an arcade racer and a simulator. This compared to arcade racers is much harder and this compared to simulaters such as Gran Turismo is a joke. If you are willing to tweke settings and work on controlling the car perfectly its worth a buy but if you are just interested in jumping into a car and racing avoid it.I like my simulators and Iike arcade racing games. Games like GRID 1, Forza, Gran Turismo, Burnout, Need for Speed all have pros and cons. Same with the game it has pros and cons. I tend to fall on a con side not liking this very much. I guess part is I was such a huge fan of GRID 1 that this one has changed so much I dislike it but I would rather play either a true arcade racer that I know what I'm getting or a true Simulator that I know how the car will handle. These crossover games that are an inbetween style I really don't like and hope they will fade out. If you try the game and like it great! If not it's probably a similar reason as me, it's not dedicated to one style of racing games it tries to hit both and misses the mark.			",123,8,15,14,23,0,21

												People are very critical with this game saying:- Controls are pretty arcade- You can turn and you must turn in every corner with a big fat drifting move- It is not a true successor to GRID (1)Actually:- Controls are pretty arcade- You can turn and you must turn in every corner with a big fat drifting move- It is not a true successor to GRID (1)So why I still recommend this game? Sure it is arcade and if you have ever driven a car with more than 200 HP than you will probably say this is bU11$h'""+t. I have not done it before. So I can say in here it is so much fun. There are a lots of nice cars, from the street and from the racing tracks also. Driving really gives you the 'fast' feeling unlike other racing games (and yes here I meant NFS). Tracks are also nice (altough maybe some more would be better but it is still enough for a career game). Graphics are okay I guess, the effects are cool but there are some details when you feel that it could have been done nicer - maybe it was a price to pay to let older PCs also run this.  If you like fast cars and you do not mind some little mistakes and arcade-ness this game is just for you. Else you should go with a real sim.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I anxiously awaited this game.  For years I watched Codemasters release ""F1"" and uninspiring ""Dirt ""titles waiting for a followup to the original Race Driver: Grid.   When I finaly got my wish I found very little of the original GRID DNA.  Tracks are gorgeous but few in number.  Car control isn't as good as the original and it seems Codemasters has come down with a serious case of ""Need For Speed"" -Itis.  In other words, The game constantly pushes DLC and relies on a quirky multiplayer engine akin to EA's Autolog.  The real problem is, that unless you pay to play you're not going to get very far in MP racing.  The game is pale in comparison to the original and wasn't worth the wait IMHO.			",61,2,9,6,2,1,1

												This is a fun arcade-racer that I have really enjoyed playing since I bought it back in September 2014, Some people like to base it off the original Grid, but this game is definitely has more of an arcade feel to it while Grid 1 I felt was more of a simulator. The Online Multiplayer Racing can be fun and enjoyable once you get the hang of the driving style that the game brings to the table and also when you make friends with a bunch of other respectable racers also... The sad things about the Online is that it is dying (I suggest you switch your download region on steam to London-UK to find more people) and there are those occasional hackers every now and then that can ruin the fun, but I enjoy the hell out of this game and playing with my racing buddies... I would recommend you buy this game when it is on sale, the $50 price tag for the reloaded edition is kind of expensive when you look at the age of the game. If you are an arcade racing game fan, I would recommend this game to you. I would believe you would enjoy this game.			",43,1,7,5,4,1,0

												I think the biggest problem of this game is in it's name: if it wouldn't have been called ""GRID"" it could get away with what it is. But people look at it and expect the experience they had with Racedriver: GRID, which this game doesn't deliver.First of all, unlike Rd:Grid the game doesn't allow the player to customize his driving experience. Rd:Grid was like ""you wanna play with keyboard? fine, here is a bunch of assists so you can handle the car with those keys. you get better at it, turn some of them off and get extra enjoyment!"" or ""ofcourse a car would slide, but only if you are not carefull enough with the throttle in the exit of the corner. still cannot tame it? just move the TC slider a little bit backwards"". This freedoms resulted in great accessebility and immense fun of driving whatever you input device was. Instead, GRID 2 says ""we got TrueFeel(tm), we have World SIDEWAYS Racing, we are all flashy and hooked up on fans which you gotta impress, so you are going to play the game OUR way!""Obligatory drifting. Oh gosh, i didn't think i ever see it this series. Thing is, you cannot tell if you are faster without it. It has  become part of the game.Again, comparing to Rd:Grid, sliding the car was never an option if you were going to set a time. You would go for a clean line, resorting to sliding in rare instances, and yet it was fully up to the player. Sliding a corner made you feel ""Hahaha yeah!"" or ""Oops, steady, steady!"". GRID 2 does it like ""Right, here we go again..."".Not knowing all that, I jumped into it with my itching fingers ready over arrow keys and was for a surprise. ""OK, it won't be easy"", i thought, and i got better at it, although still failing to have as much fun as i expected. But i kept my hopes up by thinking, ""OK, maybe if i get a controller, i might actualy get to enjoy it..."". WRONG. No ingame customization for controller device leaves it almost as clunky as keyboard. (to be fair there might be a way to make it better by editing xml file, but that's yet to find out). As it turned out, reading different forums, the game was desigined primarily for full-on steering wheel controllers, walking straight past keyboards and pads like they are history. Only a handfull of those hardcore devices seem to provide a player with  full control over the car. Yet in a game, that positions itself as leaning towards arcade driving experience...Another complaint is the track design. There are not a lot of tracks and locations to choose from. Racing tracks are alright. The trouble hides on city circuits and winding road courses. Like if half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥controls isn't enough, these end up being littered with hazards, things to hit or send a car flying off the road. Moreover, there simply isn't enough room for 12 hotheads to have their way through, making every game mode a demolition derby. This was not an issue in Rd:Grid.Coupled with turtle-paced progression of multiplayer, which doesn't reward you for anything besides placing in top 3, you will soon find that if you can't enjoy the driving in this game, there is nothing else left to look for.

												GRID 2 tries to bring a sort of story element to its career progression. Longtime fans of Codemasters’ racing games might remember the TOCA Race Driver series implementing the same idea. In regards to GRID 2, it’s about one American billionaire called Patrick Callahan, who is launching a new franchise – World Series Racing (WSR) – and has noticed your dazzling skills in the game’s opening introduction race. From there, you become the material to promote WSR across the world and are given the challenge to bring more people to the sport. How do you do this? By beating all the other rivals around the world.An assortment of events populate each season in GRID 2. For example, the first season is set in America and involves racing from point A to point B, but then you move to season three, which is set in Asia and includes events like Touge and Drifting. Along the way you’ll also get to participate in elimination races and overtake challenges. It’s fantastic that the game is throwing a varied amount of events at the player. Making your way through the seasons introduces more powerful cars. Even though GRID 2 includes around 45 cars, it manages to cover a range of types.AI, for the most part, is good and feels to have been given an aggressive characteristic, as these racers aren’t afraid to grind metal with metal with the player. Codemasters has managed to pinpoint that line between realism and arcade racing, allowing anyone who enjoys racing games but isn’t into those that try to represent a serious realism of the sport to come to GRID 2 and get in with humble ease. Online multiplayer is great fun. Players can set up their own playlist of events and what cars to use. At first, the online is limited with its vehicle selection, since the online multiplayer has its own level-up system. Hitting a target level will unlock more cars, which you can then purchase with the earnings you get from taking part in race events online.GRID 2 is a fantastic looking game on the PC. The cars look great and tracks shine with plenty of details. Sound design is brilliant, with loud, roaring car engines blasting out, giving that sense of power coming from high-performance cars.The return of the GRID franchise isn’t as ground-breaking as I would have hoped, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a great racer.

												The biggest issue with GRID 2 (and GRID 1 to an extent) is how much of a realist are you?If realism and or simulation of how race cars really handle is important to you, then GRID 2 is the worst of the bunch.A comparision I like to make on how the cars feel in Grid 2 is with Ridge Racer as the handling in GRID 2 follows the same overly eager grip that allows you to take a 90 degree turn at 120 mph. While the realism of GRID 2 is no where as dumbed down as a title like Ridge Racer, it IS pretty basic. If you have ANY experience in driving an automobile over 90 mph, then you will knowthat the cars in GRID 2 do not behave realistically at all.Graphically the game is fine. Nice effects that don't bog my system down.However, the gameplay and races themselves tend to get stale rather quickly.Once you have raced a certain type of race don't expect to see much difference in setup, length or quality of the AI from race to race either.The AI doesn't ""get better"" or any such luck, what you start with is what you get.The multiplayer in GRID 2 is dead (in the US at least) and has been for a long time.I have yet to find one single multiplayer session located in the US and no one ever joined any sessions I created.In the U.K. their seems to be a bigger following to non-oval type racing and so you can usually find more multiplayer options, but not many Steam users are willing to fiddle with Steam settings to get locked into U.K. race servers.All and all, GRID 2 was a big step back in the series with features missing, or massive DLC to get the whole package required.I hear GRID Autosport (Grid 2.5?) is a step back to the Grid 1 roots, but to be honest GRID 2 destroyed my faith in the GRID franchise to keep me away from any hope of liking it again anytime soon.If you are looking for a good arcade racer, GRID 2 is fine in short bursts.However, if you are the type to invest in a wheel and pedals and know the difference in how a car handles with or without automatic gear box, then I would stay away from GRID 2.

 About GRID 2	I have always been a fan of racing games, playing titles from NFS to GRID to DiRT to Forza, Nascar, and more. For PC, I must say that the GRID series, minus the first game, is phenomenal. GRID 2 deviates from its prior by balancing simulation-level damage and graphics with arcade-style racing. While there are a few things that were missed, such as an in-car view, the huge selection of vehicles, tracks, and environments make this game really stand out. Release Date: 28 May, 2013 Single Player Campaign	GRID 2 has a fantastic storyline. You are a new driver, trying to make a name for yourself and your racing league, WSR. You're led by the confident Patrick Callahan, who keeps you up to date on promo events, passing in races, and reminding you of sponsor objectives. The game is split into ""seasons,"" with each season taking place in a different region. At season 4, you race at tracks globally. In general, each season means a new tier of cars, but there is some overlap, making seasons 3 and 4 both T3 races. There are difficulties suitable for anyone, from racing newcomers to GRID experts. There are multiple race types, such as Endurance, Time Attack, Overtake, Drift, Race, Touge, and more, all of which are very enjoyable. The only caveat I find with any of the game modes is when playing Touge, the aggressiveness of your opponent will count against you, even if they hit you. Just avoid aggresion in this mode, and you'll be fine.Online Multiplayer	The GRID 2 community is alive and well, and the forums are still relevant. Performance is great online, and you can upgrade your cars to suit your own driving style. If I remember correctly, multiplayer lobbies can go up to 12 players at once, but please correct me if I'm wrong. Even when you beat the Single Player Campaign, you will still have loads of fun in online multiplayer.Replay Factor	One of the things that I look for in a game is whether or not it is enjoyable to play a second time, after you beat it once. I must say that this is one area where this game excels. I often found myself retrying races with different vehicles to beat my lap times, rise in the leaderboards, or just to see the difference each made.The Graphic	GRID 2 supports a wheel & pedals setup, but I simply use a keyboard. While there are disadvantages to doing so, i.e. pressing W is equivalent to going pedal-to-the-metal 24/7, the steering is very managable and drifting is easy to pick up on. The graphics are fantastic. I don't quite know what graphics engine this game runs, but I play the game on Ultra settings at 50-60 fps on a GTX 860M. It's optimized incredibly well, and lighting, shadows, and reflections all look great. You certainly won't have weather effects anywhere near games such as Project CARS or Assetto Corsa, but the game will be just fine for the vast majority of players.All in All  GRID 2 is a really nice Racing Game!9/10 From Me Sweep ",122,14,2,7,7,0,7

												According to some statistics made by the developers, they removed interior view since only like 30% used it and upon playing the game for a while you'll discover that was not the only thing they removed to save development cost and time.Pro:- Good graphics.- Decent audio, apart from the obnoxious low frequency noises switching between menus.- Fun for a short while.- Damage model- Online demolition derby.Cons:- Lack of interrior view.- Lack of any game music/theme.- No rear view mirror, you have to look back.- Extremely annoying slow animation transitions between menus, customisation..etc (aesthetics infavor of functionality)- Pure arcade car handling.- Most cars if not all are drift happy, as the game rewards drifting even in circuit racing.- Extremely annoying announcer everywhere with a sense of humor matching a cheesy car salesman, and unskipable.- Pay 2 win dlcs for online racing, as you get very few cars for online racing.- Rubberbanding AI.Overall impression: meh... skip it.

												While I enjoyed my time with GRID 2 (playing the campaign to completion), I can't in good conscience recommend it as a good example of a racing game.The odds in the game are pretty much stacked against you every which-way. If an opponent touches you your car will, nine times out of ten, spin out and you lose a ridiculous amount of ground. However, if YOU touch an opponent, you'll still receive the brunt of the damage and time lost. The AI relies wholly on rubber-banding too - drive badly, they will be more forgiving, drive well, and they'll go toe to toe with you. The gamemodes are generally enjoyable. The problem is how the game creates progression late-game. Instead of new tracks, the game simply extends old ones, or, by season 5, makes you do the same 6 mile course three times over. This wears thin quickly, and the endgame feels more like a grind than an edge-of-your-seat world championship.The game looks nice, the tracks are nice - hell, the cars are nice (if you're prepared to drop upwards of $5 to use the good ones). But when the actual gameplay is as infuriating as GRID 2 is, it really isn't worth your time/money - particularly at full price. I happpened across my copy in a Humble Bundle, and I'd be wary of paying any more than the $4 I shelled out for that bundle on this game alone.			",317,99,15,27,38,4,43

Value I purchased GRID 2 on Steam during the 2015 Summer Sale, but I did have it installed previously. Feel free to add about 15 hours to my Steam timelog for it to make up for this. You can pick it up for USD $7.50 as of writing during this ""North Pole Noir"" sale, and you certainly won't regret it. There are  number of DLC packs, all of which I personally do own but don't use very often. I feel like Codemasters hit the sweet spot with the DLC attractiveness, as there are plenty of cars in the base game that will outperform the DLC vehicles, but some of the DLC packs offer more vibrant patterns. For example, the base game's T3 Honda will outperform the T3 DLC Camaro SS, but the Camaro SS is a fantastic looking car. The reloaded edition of this game is probably the best deal you will get, at least when it is on sale.Here's a rundown of each aspect of the game and how I would personally rate it.  Aspect Rating   Physics 10   Plot 10   Damage 9   Multiplayer 10   Community 10   Graphics 10+   Value 8   Overall 9.5  Final Points on the Game Not only is GRID 2 the best racing game in its class, the unique storyline makes up from something looked over in most racing games.

												This game is not like any other Codemasters racer. They went full on Arcade this time, with a big focus on drifting. A normal race is more about drifting around corners than about finding the fastest racing line. It is almost like OutRun, you just are slower if you don't drift your way around corners. The rewind feature makes a return, further solidifying the arcade direction the series has taken with this sequel.There is no cockpit view or car setup and tuning options are minimal and only available in multiplayer. Multiplayer may appear deserted and it does suffer from low population because of matchmaking regions being based upon your Steam download server's location. There is a lively multiplayer community, but to play with more people you need to change your Steam download region to UK - London and preferably also own all of the DLC packages to get better matchmaking.In multiplayer your goal is to gain money and experience to level up to unlock new cars and upgrades which you then have to buy with the money you earned. Your multiplayer experience can be a mixed bag then in itself. In ""Playlists"" there is no voting on game modes or choice of circuits, instead the lobby is assigned a random track, car tier and gamemode. Players then have the ability veto the combination once. If the combination is vetoed you are assigned another random combination without the ability to veto it.  There is also the ""Custom Events"" option which are events hosted by other players. You gain less money and experience from participating in ""Custom Events,"" and only the lobby host can decide the settings of the event. The host has a wide variety of changeable settings, varying from type of event to forcing every player to use manual gears. There is a system called ""Impact Ratings"" in the multiplayer, which shows other players how dirty their opponents race. These are represented by circles with exclamation marks in them, with the ranking going White-Green-Yellow-Red from the best to the worst. Players with too little data to assign them an ""Impact Rating"" show as grey. The rating persists over races, and can change over time. Lots of online races tend to have people crashing into each other a lot, so do not pay too much mind to your ""Impact Rating."" When ""Impact Ratings"" are enabled, you gain a small cash bonus at the end of the race based on your rating.Also available in the Multiplayer menu are the ""Global Challenges."" These are a set of random events raced on certain circuits with either a certain Tier of cars or a specific car. Instead of racing head-to-head with another player, this game mode is leaderboard based. The game tracks your performance in the events and compares your scores to your friends. The person on the top of the leaderboard is considered to be leading the event. There are medals on the events, granting you small amounts of money and experience for passing their requirements. Based on your position on the leaderboard in the specific events you gain points for the overall leaderboard which shows who among your friends is the best racer overall. The set of events changes every few days with the leaderboards wiped at the same time.The ""Singleplayer Career"" mode casts you as the rising new talent in the fictional new racing series called World Series Racing or WSR for short. In the singleplayer you proceed through ""Seasons"" of the series, completing events and unlocking new cars from challenges. As you progress through the career you gain access to more exotic cars, going from the old muscle cars and small European hatchbacks of Tier 1 to immensely powerful and rare cars like the Koenigsegg Agera R in Tier 4. The car selection has more of an emphasis on normal street legal cars rather than Touring Cars and the like. There is no Circuit de la Sarthe or the LMP class cars to be found in this game. The circuit selection varies from fantasy street courses to real life race tracks like Brands Hatch, Indianapolis and Yas Marina. Unlike the multiplayer, the cars are simply unlocked by completing separate challenges, and cannot be upgraded. The looks of the cars can be customised with paint colour, vinyls, wheels and sponsorship logos. The sponsors also have specific challenges for you to complete. Your progress throughout the career is tracked by the amount of ""Fans"" you have. You gain fans from completing sponsor objectives and placing well in events. The ""Fans"" statistic is hidden in Codemasters' ""Racenet"" service in the multiplayer, and has no real effect on that part of the game.I don't like how the AI can nudge your car around but you really can't do the same to them. I played the game mostly on Medium difficulty, and it is easy if you just race very physically, using the other cars to navigate corners. The AI gets really challenging on Hard and becomes a far more frustrating experience. In my opinion there is noticeable gap in the AI skill between Hard and Medium that really shows in the way they react to you driving aggressively.Graphically GRID 2 looks very impressive. The crashes look nice with parts flying off and shrapnel scattering all over. The stages look nicely detailed: urban stages have detailed buildings surrounding you as you race down the streets. Forest stages look threatening with hills and dense forest just outside the track, ready to punish from the slightest mistakes with formidable damage. The game is also very well optimised and runs well even on older hardware. Sounds are probably the weakest part of the game, with similar engine sounds for most of the cars and a very annoying tire squeal sound effect. There is also the sound of crowds cheering, but beyond that ambient sounds are nonexistent.Grid 2 is a solid arcade racer with great graphics, but is sadly hamstrung by its emphasis on drifting over real racing lines, stagnant AI and multiplayer which frequently devolves to a demolition derby. Fans of more arcade racing games like the Need For Speed series will find much to like here, while fans of the more realistic approach of the first game should give this game a pass.

												I wasn't sure if I could recommend it or not. The game can be fun, but it might be frustrating either.First of all: the sngle player mode. Basically your goal is to beat Harrison Carter (a bot), who always finishes first or second (if you're first). The rest of bots is always drunk so don't even mind them. A car driven by AI which is in front of you is always slower than you. It can't drift, never puts pedal to the metal. Is it easy to overtake them? Of course not. The roads are usually so narrow that you're usually blocked by AI cars. If any other car touches yours or you touch it, you'll instantly spin out so don't even try to crash the bots. And here goes the magic! Whenever a car driven by AI is behind you, it starts driving like a pro: never uses break, never reduces speed, never touches anything (and if so, its car isn't damaged at all). It overtakes you in a moment and then it becomes the slow one again. Oh and the best thing, you always starts from the second to last position so have fun with being blocked by cars in front of you and being bumped by cars behind you.The multiplayer is totally unfair. Guy who starts from better position (especially the first and the second) has always a huge adventage. If he is as good as you, and has a good car you have no chance to overtake him. Also there isn't really any punishment for attacking others so feel free to be a♥♥♥♥♥♥and keep on hitting any car you want.Multiplayer is fun when you play with your friends (unless they play fair).

												Good graphics, decent car list. That about sums up the positives.The physics, oh boy. To be quick, you have to drift, which in itself goes against ANY logic, at least on tarmac. And the way you drift is moronic as well- the car just steps out, no matter what you do. If you try driving sensibly, you understeer like you're running bald summer tires in snow. If you don't want to do so, you have to drift, but how can you do it properly when throttle control basically doesn't exist? It just boggles my brain that a game of this pedigree can handle worse than Mario Kart 64.This is the worst driving game I own by far. I regret spending 6EUR on it, even though it was in a bundle. Speaking of which, can you refund Humble Bundle games?			",44,1,10,4,6,0,2

As someone brand new to the genre, and the series I really enjoyed this game from the start, It wasn’t hard to start; however as I left easy mode the game offered more rewards and challenges.The visuals are simply amazing, and the game play is very solid. The Good* Amazing graphics* Very good gamepad compatibility, would like to find a good wheel that is compatible withthis game. * Game is a lot of fun.* Native 144hz monitor resolution support. Needs Improvement* Takes a while to find a match online at non peak hours. Overall Rating 10 / 10			",520,48,24,27,36,8,89

												Dear God, what have you done to GRID?Still insisting on finishing it as a fan, halfway through season 2 I realized they must've said something like ''Lets not bother with putting actual damage mechanics, simulation aspects from the original game, cockpit view etc, but instead, lets give the cars absurd physics and call it a simulation''.No matter which difficulty setting you're playing on (tried all), your car is your biggest opponent. It will constantly try to spin no matter what you do, just staying on the road is a challenge and it gets better and better when an opponent actually 'touches' your car, no matter which position, no matter what speed, say hello to the wall over there.I'll probably finish it for the sake of achievements and completion but hell, doing it with a vw golf because it's one of the few cars that manages to stay on the damned road is a shame...Screw graphics, go buy the original GRID, still beats this one.

												~ One of the best and also my favorite racing game of all time! ~PROS:- Quality PC port, featuring lots of graphics and control options;- Gorgeous DX11 graphics;- Completionist Playstyle delivers approximately 28h or even more of actual 'raw' gameplay;- It is very fun to be played online with a couple of friends; the more friends the better hahaCONS:- The lack of a soundtrack during races, except the sometimes annoying ""last lap excitement"" music;- The chance of getting a VAC Ban by messing with the Field of view (FOV) option and then play Multi-player afterwards.Version differences: Reloaded Edition includes all of the DLC, except for the Car Unlock Pack!All in all, I really do think that Codemasters have outdone themselves with Grid 2 and they created a masterpiece of a racing game, a Legend!

												TLDR at the bottom.I came into this expecting a better and updated Grid 1, a worthy successor to a pretty decent (although flawed) racing game.What i got was a chineese bootleg of need for speed.Grid 1's physics though quirky and in dire need of a few small fixes have been thrown completely out the window in favour of some simplified super arcady system that bears no resembelance of realism to the first one.Grid 1's cars had a ""points rating"" for performance 4/5 5/5 ect. This is not a very good system but in Grid 2 they have moved to an even worse system where each stat of performance is a bar. This makes comparing cars virtually impossible. not to mention the majority of cars share the same statline.the cutscenes are cringeworthy, They strike right into the heart of the ""old white man trying to appeal to young kids of the digital age"" as if the game is almost a parody of itself. The ESPN sections are especially cringeworthy, i wonder how much their paid for licensing to an american only complay for an american live action cutscene THAT IS UNSKIPPABLE. Atleast they have done away with the horrible sponsor screen from GRID 1. that would take  way too long to scroll. Grid 2 allows you to skip alot of parts.Pros:More carsUpdated GraphicsPost-Race Sponsor rundownCons:Physics is terribleunskippable cringeworhty cutscenesPhysics are awfulAI is on rails & cheatsThe game is legitimately not fun to drive in.By far the worst event is the random track events without a co-driver or minimap its a random chance that a corner is a hairpin or open. you have to take every corner at slow speed.Alot of other events are 1-3 laps meaning you have no time to learn the circuit at all. TLDR: its not Grid 2. Its bootleg need for speed. If you like the NFS series. enjoy if you wanted a successor to Grid1. youre SOL.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Before buying the game be aware of what Codemasters Customer Services says: ""This version of the game does not officially support Windows 10"" and ""We have no plans for a Windows 10 patch"". The game runs like a charm on my PC, but it crashes to Windows desktop every 3-5 minutes, often in a middle of a race series. I've tried all the guides community post all over the internet on this problem and none of them help. And with no help from tech support, I guess I've just poured my money to drain.

												Its a very good game though for me not as good as the Grid One was. I just like more simulation than it's in this part. The grid one gave a choice in multiplayer. This one does not. Anyway, playability is still very good, competition and player development makes it almost imposible to stop playing the effect ""just one more race"" is definitely there, then you become a new car and have to test it and so on. Easy to play, hard to master. And nobody should be angry that it is not an Gran Tourismo or a Forza. Graphics 7/10, Sound 8/10, Gameplay 9/10. Arcade 70% Simulation 30% Gameplay isnt the most important  thing for me but I give it a nine out of 10 score because of the DLC politics.			",138,17,19,18,54,3,28

												Well, Codemasters, I have been racing with you since Colin Mcrae Rally 2.0, V8 Supercars 2 and now in the present: coming from F1-2010 to 2013 I felt like a change, and decided over Dirt 3 that I buy Grid 2. First I will start with the cons. -Firstly, NO DRIVERS CAM? What kind of racing game doesn't have that!? Even Colin Mcrae which was a 2000s' era game had it! I get the feeling this isn't a simulation game but more of an arcade. -Secondly yes the realism. The damage model is excellent, smashing into things has never been so fun. But lacks, tire wear and rain? Can't change car setups in career mode unless its hidden? I have looked.-Thirdly Racenet... I am logged in, but I cannot for the life of me, figure out why my times don't show on the friend scoreboard in career mode, I have tried logging out and back in but no cigar. As a competitive racer, I is sad about this.-Lastly the price of the All In DLC is way too expensive for a game which is now dead. By dead I mean, I cannot find a single online race. I won't waste money on unlocking cars I cannot use.OK now for the pros!-Firstly I'm more of a grippy guy so seeing a variety of cars is great! I get such a rush from using the Caterham, it grips so well and it flies. -The graphics are beautiful and at max settings I never dip below 60fps-The career mode. What can I say, an immersive story in which you are a racer working up through the ranks with goodies like unlocking cars  watching the protagonist gain social media attention and fans, The AI provide a challenge even though I have yet to lose a race or even finish second (Hard difficaulty, damage on, flashbacks on)My conclusions is, as a racing fan who always leaned towards Formula One, it was nice to get back to actual road cars. Please remember this is my review, my opinion. I'm sure you think differently and you will let me know in the comments.			",82,14,12,8,14,1,4

												Exceptional bad mechanics. Every single car drifts, making it totally unpleasant. The worst part is the abysmal AI of the cars, taking racing lines regardless if you are taking the line and then there is the factor that any car can bump you off track. They bump into your backside and you spin, you bump into their backside and you spin. All in all this is a poor game which I received as a gift and won't spend a penny on.  ",22,0,1,0,1,0,0

												This is probably one of the best, if not the best, racing games on Steam. Sure, the graphics are maybe a year or two behind, but the game was released in 2013. That being said, I think that it still stands up to newer games like Forza. Every once in a while this game goes on sale for next to nothing. That means that anyone can afford it if they wait for the perfect opportunity. If you want a realistic driving simulator, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a great driving game with an incredibly vast on-line mode and a story mode worth playing, it's all right here. I like it. I think you'll like it.			",208,22,6,8,21,2,9

												- DLC bloated. Sometimes, from 10 cars you COULD use, 8 come from DLCs.- Annoying, long, cheesy cut-scene sequences- Drifting worse than GRID (1)- Bad bots are too bad, leading bots are too good. You always start at the end, and you have to mow through all the bad bots, who are simply road block for you. After you've done that, you have to chase down those bots, who HAPPEN to start at the front every single time. Gets pretty annoying after some time.			",125,25,4,18,14,0,20

												9/10 -Great sense of speed and collection of cars. The damage system is spectacular and racing your friends is always fun. All the cars handle like a dream. The engines sound like the real thing. The only thing that I was disappointed in was the game doesn't have a cockpit view (inside the car) and you can't upgrade or tune your car in anyway in singleplayer but you can customize your ride like change rims, tire size, colors and decals. Multiplayer on the other hand you can tune your car making it faster. I hate how this game has so much DLC because if you own a certain DLC and your friend doesn't you can't play it with them making that new DLC useless unless you want to play it by yourself. Overall it's the best street racing game I ever played but just short of perfect.			",1265,217,58,47,53,9,81

												After my favorite racing game of all time called GRID and a long wait,I expected a lot of GRID 2 thinking that this will be another awesome simulation masterpiece,but I thought wrong.GRID 2 is nothing like it's previous part and it didn't achieve my expectation but still,I can not say that this game is not good.GRID 2 is a great racing game on it's own way.True it is arcade gameplay but still very enjoyable one and not that simple as it may seem like.Every car have it's own behaviour,grip,drift or balanced type cars they all have a different feel and most of them are challenging to drive if you are aiming for the limit.Driving get even more exciting knowing that there is no option to turn on stability or traction control,racing line or a breaking point.Your driving depends only on your own knowledge with the cars and tracks.Career mod is good,there are many different cars in a different tiers,a lot of tracks and a lot of different race types you will go through and makes you feel like a real driver.AI is not as strong as on GRID but they do sometimes hit you on a straight line with no reason maybe just to prepare you better for a multiplayer.Speaking of a multiplayer,great thing is that you can have all cars in garage and you are able to upgrade most of them.You even have a option to fully upgrade a car which will then be in a next tier with other stronger cars and making your driving more challenging.Driving clean races is very hard on multiplayer because there are so many different car types in a same tier which requires different racing style and ""I didn't mean to"" is almost unavoidable,so I mostly prefer collisions off settings.Not like on GRID,here you get penalized for cutting the corner but on the other hand,you wont get penalized for so-called ""riding the wall"" thing where you can gain time and make other players angry.Graphics are very good,details of the cars,tracks,places and cityes are awesome.Car damage is ok,physics are not so good.There is this ridiculous thing when you crash on some street track and the car bounces form side to side across the track like a pinball.As a fan of a GRID series,GRID 2 deserves a great 8.5/10 because for me game basicly have only 2 problems, 1.It steps out from first GRID, 2.GRID Autosport was released too soon.

												I played through single player with my Logitech G27 Racing Wheel. I didn't try playing it with a controller, but I do know that this game is designed to be controller friendly.I found this game to give a really fun racing experience without being punishingly difficult or realistic. Unlike games that are designed to be simulations first, it really feels like GRID 2 is designed to be a fun game first.The fun comes from a few things. First of all, the racing does really feel ""intense"" - this comes through thanks to all the great visuals and sounds. It's not easy to describe, but there's just loads of polish on the overall aesthetic. The wide variety of levels and locations really helps here as well.Second of all, they have lots of little ways to prevent you from getting frustrated. My favorite mechanic is the flashback mechanic - it basically lets you rewind time to undo a mistake you made. This is really great because not only does it prevent you from going ""oh no, I need to restart the whole race..."", it also gives you the opportunity to learn much more quickly. There's a limit to how many times you can do this so it doesn't make the game too easy. Furthermore, they have a wide range of difficulty settings for all levels of experience. I have only played a few racing games and found the Easy difficulty to be decently challenging without being frustrating. Finally, they have this guy who is talking to you all the time who will ocassionally offer useful suggestions and keep you focused on what to do during a race (and it doesn't get annoying, in my opinion).Third, the overarching story of trying to get fame for the WSR feels like a pretty significant goal. There's lots of different ways you can advance the story (for example, if you don't like a particular type of event you can focus on other types of events).My major issue with the game is that, towards the fourth WSR series, I felt like the content was becoming a bit same-y and it started to feel like a bit of a grind.Overall, if you are interested in having a fun racing experience as a change from a hardcore, realistic racing sim, this game is pretty fun. I haven't played many other PC games in the genre, though, so take this recommendation with a grain of salt.			",216,50,8,24,23,3,32

Product received for free
												GRID 2 is a half-simulator, half arcade style racer that is a genuine balance between both styles of racing genre and can be categorised in a league of its own in terms of car handling and circuit design. Interior view has been removed from the original GRID which is disappointing as I feel that this camera view adds authenticity to a racing game, even if it is rarely used, I would’ve liked to switch views mid-race to know that my driver was steering the car.  The music being added at climatic points in each event adds immersion in the racing experience, unlike games such as Forza or Gran Turismo which have static tracks played all race. This game is a minor step down in drifting compared to GRID 1, however city circuit tracks for regular racing seem to have a realistic transition between brick, asphalt and kerbs unlike the games predecessor.Codemasters has created World Racing League ‘WCR’ were your job is to race a variety of racing clubs from the US, Middle-East, Europe and Asia to attract ‘fans’. The inclusion of ESPN a well-known sport commentating channel in the US adds a layer of mirrored fame found in real life and adds depth in the single player experience, which helps new players to the genre engage in this racing game. The addition of displaying short story clips of your racing fame across YouTube, the WSR in game website and SMS messages motivates you to aim for a greater number of fans. While story typically lacking in racing games, Codemasters has pulled of a story mode that doesn’t ruin the experience of racing or feel that there is any difficulty in progressing to the next race as skipping events is optional. As you near completion of a race, overtaking a threat (another popular driver), complete a race or experience damage issues your crew chief will annoy you which adds to the enjoyment of the game but gets repetitive as you progress through the game. Throughout the game the same tracks, modes and simular challenges were reused however the difficulty of driving a faster vehicle in the later stages of the game compensates for this. Codemasters could pull some of the officially licenced world class circuits from the F1 series into Grid 2.In short the singleplayer provides a decent range of content despite the large amount of additional content and will give at least 24 hours of gameplay in the base game*, additional tracks including the extravagant demolition derby has been brought from GRID 1 in a free DLC which is brilliant for local multiplayer fun with friends and family. The demolition derby features only one car to choose from that is kitted out just for demolition events which you can select in the quick race menu for single or multiplayer modes. It was disappointing that Grid 2 features the same tracks as its predecessor, which feels like Codemasters reworked the handling of the vehicle in this mode to be significantly easier to control, making it harder to slide out. *Please do note that I have played this game for console on release week. *In GRID 2 online unlike the ‘WRS’ singleplayer mode you can purchase and upgrade vehicles performance. The new rivalry mode allows users to set up randomly assigned online players which compete for XP to crown the ‘better racer’, this mode I feel is underused at the time of writing this review but is a great feature that I believe GRID should integrate with the main multiplayer mode of future titles. There is also a global challenge that ranks your account on various tracks against world times and a full featured online mode which has typical lobby matchmaking as you would expect. With some interesting indicators for racers which prefer to drive aggressively indicated by traffic light colour exclamation marks next to their profiles. Also by purchasing the DLC you get no advantage over users who have not purchased the DLC other than the specific vehicle, and all tiers are able to be used from the start in multiplayer however if you want more cars they need to be purchased unlike the singleplayer. Grid 2 is a graphically enhanced GRID 1 with several race types such as checkpoint, time attack, endurance, face off, drift, touge, races that change each lap and regular races found in the single payer as well as the multiplayer. GRID 2 is a well-priced game to buy standalone during a sale event, do not be pressured to purchase the DLC’s on offer for this title as the content is not worth what you pay for. The free DLC of demolition derby is to be expected as it features the same tracks and cars from the previous title, but I found that the gameplay was more enjoyable for the demolition derby races than in the original GRID. The lack of cockpit view is a major letdown and detracts the simulation aspect found in the previous title. Both GRID 1 and 2 are great games and if you prefer a more Arcady family and friend gaming experience than GRID 2 is the game of choice out of the two which is an easy game to get into for beginners. Overall GRID 2 is a brilliant game that can be set apart from the previous title in ways, however there has been key gameplay features removed and missed from the original game.*Please do note that I have received this game for the purpose of reviewing it*			",1767,672,92,194,219,23,257

												This game is not really an improvement over Race Driver: GRID, except for the graphics. This game has a number of defects including:- No cockpit view (apparently because of ""memory constraints"". Really? This is a PC game, right?)- A high chance of having zero multiplayer which still hasn't been fixed after 8 months- Cheaters in multiplayer if you are lucky enough to have it- DLC is pretty bad, seemingly just content ripped from release so you can pay extra- DLC shown during any car select so it feels like you're playing a demoThe physics are er, ...interesting. It's very drift friendly - perhaps for the younger generation - and sometimes I like this and sometimes it seems my car breaks into a slide purely at random.Singleplayer - Seems to be 90% city courses so far (I'm most of the way through tier 3) with only the occasional time trial on decent real world circuits, which might be quite a disappointment for Race Driver: GRID fans. The much hated Codemasters D0uchebag™ is alive and present in singleplayer, sounding like an absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ idiot blabbering on about social media ... I want to punch that fool. Fortunately you can tun him off which is a massive improvement over Dirt 3, where you are forced to listen to the fūckwit tell you to ""upload your video to youtube!!11!1!!"". Only things it's got going for itself is the graphics and the damage modelling. If you're looking for a sequel to GRID I suggest you look at Shift 2 Unleashed, even for all it's problems it's far superior to this.			",310,30,31,31,28,7,41

												A big disappointment, particularly compared to the first GRID.  While the UI and the conceit are cool, the game is disgustingly crammed with DLC. How disgusting? The cars that ""count"" as DLC are DIFFERENT between the single player and online versions of the game.  Also, it doesn't work with my racing wheel (a Microsoft Sidewinder Pro) which did work with the original game. Playing it with a Xbox gamepad just isn't the same.On a possitive note, the racing *feels* very fast, and the maps are good, particularly the country road ones. So if you value feeling fast over anything else, this might be the racing game for you.			",263,78,7,54,31,6,55

												It's a solid game, with beautiful graphics, scenery and the sound effects are very good, but it feels mainly ""arcadeish"", good for people bad in driving games (myself included). The game however has settings that add more manual handling control to the user, but the gameplay itself lacks realism. The game main campaign might look interesting for the first few races, but then it gets too repetitive,  every time it's the same venues, the tracks are just slightly different from one another when racing in the same place or are exactly the same you played on before, very poor variablility. Also, some events are ultra repetitive as you have to run in the same track over and over, and do not add anything different to the gameplay.The multiplayer part of the game is fun at first, but levelling up was taking a lot of time and made me lose interest on keeping racing on every same track all the time. Also finding a lobby with a lot of people is not an easy task, maybe this can vary with the region of the world. The good part about the multiplayer is playing with friends and laughing about the mistakes and crashes.One thing very annoying is shoving in your face the ""add-on"" cars (DLC) when you go to select your car to play. Add-on cards should only be shown if I had the cars, not telling me to purchase them. If you want to advertise it in the game, make it so in the main menu... By the way, they added a ""Reloaded"" edition, which is just the same base game with all the DLC included in a single package, another way to milk more money out of DLC.--------Portuguese translation:O jogo é bem feito, tem belos gráficos, cenários e efeitos sonoros são muito bons, mas o jogo é muito arcade, bom para o público geral que não joga bem jogos de corrida (eu incluso nisso). Porém o jogo permite configurações que permitem maior controle manual por parte do jogador, mas mesmo assim o jogo não prima em realismo. A campanha principal do jogo é interessante no início, principalmente nas primeiras corridas, mas daí em diante se torna repetitivo demais, são sempre nas mesmas cidades, os circuitos mudam muito pouco mesmo quando o modo de corrida muda, muitas vezes são os mesmos circuitos/traçados, a variedade é bem fraca. Os eventos em si também são bem repetitivos, muitas vezes você tem que correr na mesma pista várias vezes, e nada de diferente é adicionado à jogabilidade.O modo multiplayer é início no começo, mas subir de level parece muito lento e me fez perder o interesse em jogar online nos mesmos circuitos de novo toda hora. Encontrar uma sala com muita gente também não é tarefa muito fácil, de repente falta jogador se for dividido por região. O legal do multiplayer é jogar com amigos e rir dos erros e batidas.Uma coisa bem chata é ficar mostrando toda hora os carros ""add-on"" (DLC) quando você vai selecionar o seu carro pra corrida. Esses carros opcionais só deveriam ser mostrados caso o usuário tivesse a DLC, não ficar toda hora mostrando que pode comprar, é irritante. Se quer fazer propaganda faça no menu inicial... A propósito, eles lançaram uma versão ""Reloaded"" que nada mais é do que o mesmo jogo com todas as DLCs inclusas num pacote, outra forma incentivar a prática caça-níquel de DLCs.

													Grid 2 is yet another racing game from arcade racing specialists Codemasters and make no mistake, this is no simulation.  Racing is centred around street circuits, permanent racing venues and a few single stage like events. 	There is a wide variety of events available from straight races, time trials, checkpoint races, endurance (7 whole minutes at a time!), drift, eliminator and others.  The best of these is the “liveroutes” events that occur in one of the major cities.  The route is randomly chosen when you start a race and the mini-map is disabled resulting in you having to pay attention to the upcoming corner to judge entry speed.  Though once you have been playing the single player portion of the game for a while it does become easier as the locations while appearing huge are quite limited in how many layouts are available.	The game is absolutely beautiful though, from the various locations like Paris, Hong Kong and Barcelona to all the car models and how damage appears on them.  The game also performs admirably on even modest machines.My biggest issue with the game is how the cars drive and more importantly how the AI cars drive.  Cars come in two varieties, tail happy and not, that's about it.  Front wheel drive cars drive like front wheel drive cars, four wheel drive cars are glued to the road and for rear wheel drive it's seemingly random whether it's glued to the road or wants to head for the bushes at every corner.  This behaviour tends to drive you to only driving a couple of cars like the Caterham LMP-like track car the Audi R8 LMS.The opposition AI is also an issue.  Instead of allowing the AI to drive the track and react to conditions and you as they appear, the AI cars seem to be pre-programmed to move around the track in a certain way like robots.  It's frustrating in many ways as you end up making the same passes all the time as you quickly become aware of their weaknesses.  There are also some bizarre changes in difficulty, some races are ridiculously easy on the highest setting while others are quite hard on the lowest.  Both these criticisms could be made of just about every Codemasters racing game, maybe with the next Dirt or Grid they could concentrate on AI?All in all this is a very decent Arcade racer, it doesn't do anything new or exciting that is deserving of paying full price, but is a good way or wasting a few hours here and there.

												Game is not worth it. Anything made good in this game is lost by the fact that every AI car in the game are on rails that are harder to break than Wolverine's Bones. You can not race against them without constant annoyance. They will push and shove you out of their way like your car is made out of paper cups and they are titanium. That is on any difficulty. I would recommend Dirt3 but that is a no go as well, as it can not save. It is a dark day for driving games, a dark day indeed.			",54,7,1,9,10,1,8

												Although, It really is ALOT of fun to play, The truth of the matter is, the game have major flaws....The game saves becoming corrupted, I believe that was done by CM on purpose, just to sell the unlock pack to all the frustrated racers who would have to race with none of the cool unlocked cars. Then they ""fixed"" it.  So now, my gamesave file is corrupt again, and there is no way to fix it. Well, the 68.00 + tx  I spent on this game thus far, seems to be wasted money..DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. When I complained on a thread made by one of the developers re: VAC being intigrated into GRID 2, I fired of a comment""Are you going to corrupt our gamesaves, and sell us VAC like u did with the UNLOCK PACK.?""Now, before I posted, comments were coming in at around, 1 per 4 to 5 hours. 10 mins after I posted, 15 comments in 10 minutes, and NOT 1 had anything to do with my comment. The next morning. Codemasters deleted the tread, and moved all feedback to the forums, so they can instantly edit out comments that they dont like. And I know this sounds paranoid, But my gamesave didnt corrupt for the 2nd time, until I posted a VERY similar comment on a steam freinds profile.I am openly and publicly calling CODEMASTERS out.YOU SCAMMED US, AND YOU KNOW IT!!!!!!!!!-the worst part is. I really liked that game. Id recommend D/L a torrent, You wont have multiplayer, but with the gamesave issue, your only saving yourself the heart ache of losing all your work, and just when it get good, the game save corrupts...

												In my opinion, the game is worth it if it's under $20.  I've been a active racer for this game since day one.  I've preordered it on Steam because it had the best DLC bundle compared to the console counterparts.  The only DLC packs that matter are the mclaren pack, the mercedes pack, and the gt-r pack in my opinion.  Since there were a lot of folks that pre-ordered it too, you'll be able to use those cars on a regular basis in the public lobbies.  Both the Mclaren and Mercedes DLC cars for TIER 4 are the ONLY upgradeable ones.  You can not upgrade any other DLC cars.  Also, the GT-R pack is good because it gives you a good option to be competative in Tier 3 when you are starting out as a low level driver.As far as multiplayer goes, just make sure you set your download region to a European server (since the game is region-locked).  If you are looking forward to drift mode like the one from GRID 1, then be prepared to be let down.  Because of the new physics engine, it's nothing like it's predecessor.  But I like the racing portion a lot though.  The reason why I liked the GRID 1 was because all the cars had the SAME SPECS.  So the only thing that defines the winner is skill and the racing lines the driver takes to get to the top.  With the upgrade customization aspect thrown into the mix in GRID 2,  it's now about which setup get's you the best performance in the car along with what lines you take.  As you meet faster racers, you'll learn what are the best setups for the best car in each tier or, for me, the best setup for your driving style.  Add in the ""active obstactle"" for the mental game of how are you going to pass this racer cleanly for an extra challenge.  Also, if you are pretty confident in your skills and are in a room full of noobs, you can challenge yourself by giving the noobs a 10 second head start.

												I have not played a lot of racing games on pc, but I can say Grid 2 is one of the best I have tried. I hear a lot of complaints about it being not realistic enough, but for me that's just fine (after all my favorite racing series is the F Zero series). I have not played its predecessor but I can say that I do enjoy Grid 2 quite a bit. I am having trouble putting into words what I like about Grid 2, after all I cant even describe what sets it apart from other racing games. I can say however, that I have not noticed anything ""wrong"" with the game per se. It ran good for me, it was easy to learn, and it was fun to play, and in the end, are those not the most important aspects of a game? I cant tell you why you should be interested in Grid 2, but if you are a fan, you've got to at least give it a look. I cant guarantee you wont be disappointed. But you will never know until you try.			",374,143,14,85,57,11,89

												One of the best racing games I have ever played!Really nice gameplay, cars, controls, graphics. Also runs amazing on laptop chips :)The story mode is great and the multiplayer is fun too, the only dowside can be the car styling but its not a big deal.You should really consider geting this if you are a fan of racing games but also if you like games with ""speed"", like going really fast. It really feels like you are in the car in this game and to be honest it feels great!This game is also very realistic on the crashes, it really looks like a real car that has been damaged.Is ths game worth buying at full price? Yes it is!Will it run on a older pc? Yeah it will, actually runned at medium/high settings on my laptop.1-10? 9/10 :)			",555,107,23,60,36,7,62

												Don't get me wrong, this game had potential but just has some major issues that make it almost unplayable.- HandingThe cars handle like complete crap and are either boaty as♥♥♥♥♥♥or so sensative you can't drive in a straight line. The cars spin so freaking easily and its impossible to overcome a spin or control it. If you so much as touch someone, you spin, if you touch a wall you spin, if you do anything you spin. Trying to drift is nearly impossible, as soon as you start to slide, it's like a bar of soap sliding on the bottom of a wet bath tub. Honestly phone racing games have better handling this. 3/10- PerformanceI don't know if this is my own fault, or what but after playing the game for 10 hours the performance decided to jump off a cliff and I know it's not me playing on a weak PC, I play Shift 2 above 60 fps no issue at all on max. If it wasn't for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ performance, the graphics would be really good. 4/10- DifficultyI don't want to play a game that is so easy you dust everyone, but damn its nearly impossible to win even if the game didn't have the ♥♥♥♥♥iest handling ever. If all of the AI have the same car as you, they are still way faster in all ways despite them owning the EXACT same car as you. It makes winning more of a hassle than fun, you end up restarting the event over and over again until either you wreck one of the AI or they do something stupid and you get extremly lucky. 2/10If you want a nice looking track racing game, just get Shift 2, it's a lot better and cheaper, you even get all the DLCs for free.

												This game has fantastic graphics even on a laptop with very average specs. I like almost everything about it, except the handling. It's a huge drift fest. The developers decided that drifting around corners going 180 km/h is a good idea. I've played other racing games before, but simply had no luck with this one because the cornering physics is so different. I could train myself to handle the cars this way, but I don't want to change my habits for just one game.Mind you, this IS an ARCADE STYLE racing game. I shouldn't have been expecting realism. If you like more realistic handling (i.e. actually braking before cornering), try Grid Autosport. I bought this game with all the DLC, wish I could get all the money back but it's too late. I really want to like this game, and I had some good times with it in the beginning, but soon I realised that it's not meant for me.			",56,3,3,6,8,0,4

												Bought on sale after loving GRID I was hoping for something good but came away disappointed. The cars and graphics are nice enough. Now on the bad bits. The menu system is akward and ends up intrusive to the game overall, instead of letting you get the best of it. That could be lived with if it was not for the biggest issue this game has. It lacks the visceral experience of a RACE compared to the original. This is down to cars feeling unpredictable/non linear in their behaviour. During gameplay there is an unmistakable feeling of driving aids being too overpowering. They don't make the game fun by taking care of a the odd blunder, they smother it sadly. All of the above was evident from the first few minutes of gameplay, I persevered for the sake of the game for 6 hours of total gameplay. In the end I am sad to say this is a game you should 100% avoid if you want a fun and thrilling racing experience. This is not on a sim or arcade spectrum. The core gameplay just does not work here... The original GRID left me thrilled, this just furstrated			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wouldn't recommend this game to any one after finishing the career mode.So this is the 2nd of the GRID series. It has better music and better graphics. A race in Algave on a sunny day is really beautiful. A richer car list than GRID, including those breathtaking racing cars and those flashing super or hyper car. The idea of WSR is also great, getting drivers from all over the world, from different clubs, having different driving style to race rogether is great fun.But seriously, because you're the post boy of WSR, and your job is to attract those racers to take part in WSR, you'll have no chance to take part in 24h Le Mans. And for this you're saying goodbye to those stunning prototypes, which is a great lost for me. Well they left me a SP300R though.So since I won't recommend this game to anyone else, how imperfect it is? Well, the career mode, I'd devide it into three parts, the boring part I like a game of NFS, the best second part and the total nightmare of the third part. Why is that? The cars in this game are divided in to three types: grip, balanced and drift. Sounds reasonable, right? But the problem is, GRID2 didn't have a right idea of drfting, and made drfting literally spinning. It's alright at first, when your cars are always slow so you can remain in control. But that makes it feel like NFS. When you're going into Europe, grip type of cars appear. You'll find them funny to drive, with sometimes a little bit of slide, you'll have a lot of fun in driving. But when it comes to the later part of the game, especially when you have those Tier 4 super car. The spin on those super car becomes uncontrollable, so when you are racing in HongKong or Co d'Azure, you'll have to go carefully (and slowly) to avoid spinning and crashing. And even worse, only one of the super cars is grip type. The problem is caused by the poor physics of this game, like everyone else said.And then, BOTs. Thanks to spinning, the Koenisegg Agera R is literally undrivable. But, you'll find out those BOTs will drive this car like a gust of wind, no crashing, no spinning and don't even slide! And like GRID, BOTs of GRID2 like crashing too. That Bruno Silva guy, before the race the radio will tell you he's so agressive and always crashing others, so he hit me, well, I can't blame anyone because they warned me the guy was dangerous. But when they tell me Eliminaciόn drivers are afraid of trade paint, those guys still crashed on me. My face was like ""dafaq"" as I was spinning. So since those BOTs made you so upset, why not spin them out or crash them out of track to take some revenge? No, you won't move them a little bit. If they crash you, you'll spin, and if you crash them, you'll spin too! And in two racing type the BOTs made themselves boss there. One of them is touge. In touge competitor will take penalty for hitting other driver. But in GRID2 it's directly disqualified. And here is the problem. If you crash them, you'll get disqualified, that's the rule. But if they crash you, you're still getting disqualified. Simple. The other one is drifting race. Drifting race is literally a series of jokes in GRID2. Just get behind one of your competitor and see how they drive and you'll find out that it's no even sliding, just driving fast through every corner like a normal race. And when you get to the finish you'll find out that they still have a decent score for that. Drifting itself is a joke in GRID2, drifting race is a series of jokes.In career mode you can test drive your cars. But it's only one lap only in Indianpolis. So in real life it's reasonable because those race track will charge you for using their tracks. If you don't have much money you won't be able to go like 10 laps on the track. But come on! If you can't drive those racing car on the race track freely, why are you still playing it? Are we playing a race manager simulator rather than a  race driver simulator, if it ever is?And, well, no Nürburgring, even worse.5/10, for the middle part of the career mode is a lot fun.

												A game with a splendid visual work. As well for tracks, cities, landscapes or cars, although the choice of Japanese and American is excessive. Here, neither Porsche, Ferrari, nor Lamborghini, etc. (And Audi, Zenvo, Jaguar, Volvo or other AMG against which you run in WSR, are not available in DLC) But the principal critic to do to this game, it's that instead of being called “GRID 2”, it should be called “DRIFT 2” so much ALL the cars drift, in spite of medium settings. Some are almost impossible to handle, like Ford Sierra 500, Pagani Zonda Revolucion, McLaren MP4-12C, Honda NSX-R or Koenigsegg CCGT. Even the Dallara Indy with its slick tires drifts ! What is incredible for Racing Cars which should remain like on rails ! But at the opposite, others cars are totally understeer like the three types of Nissan GTR, the Ford UTE or the brilliant Subaru Tomei Cusco Impreza. (With these cars, take care to the size choice of your rims !) And let's not speak about the non-existent braking of almost all the cars except this little fabulous Subaru Impreza, the ridiculous engine sound of some, or the too low top speed of others. Only 223 MpH for the CCGT and 214 for the Dallara : a bad surprise, because normaly these cars exceed 250 MpH ! And for the “OnLine Races"", better is to forget. It's Stock-Car between furious insane, not of the Automobile race...Un jeu avec un travail visuel magnifique, que ce soit pour les voitures, les circuits, les villes ou les paysages, bien que le choix des Japonaises et Américaines soit excessif. Ici, ni Porsche, ni Ferrari, ni Lamborghini, etc. (Et les Audi, Zenvo, Jaguar, Volvo et autres AMG contre lesquelles on court en WSR, ne sont pas disponibles en DLC) Mais le principal reproche que je ferais à ce jeu, c'est qu'au lieu de s'appeller ""Grid 2"", il devrait s'appeller ""Drift 2"" tellement  TOUTES les voitures dérapent malgré des réglages medium. Certaines sont quasiment inconduisibles, comme la Ford Sierra 500, la Pagani Zonda Revolucion, la McLaren MP4-12C, la Honda NSX-R ou la Koenigsegg CCGT. Même la Dallara Indy avec ses pneus slicks, dérape ! Ce qui est un comble pour des Voitures de Course qui devraient rester sur des rails ! Mais à l'opposé, d'autres voitures sont totalement sous-vireuses comme les trois types de Nissan GTR, la Ford UTE ou la géniale Subaru Tomei Cusco Impreza. (Avec ces bagnoles, faites gaffe au choix de la taille de vos jantes !) Et ne parlons pas du freinage inexistant de presque toutes les voitures excepté de cette fabuleuse petite Subaru Impreza, du ridicule son-moteur de certaines, ou de la trop basse vitesse de pointe d'autres. Seulement 360 KmH pour la CCGT et 345 pour la Dallara : une mauvaise surprise, parce que normalement ces voitures dépassent les 400 KmH ! Quant aux ""courses en Ligne"", mieux vaut oublier. C'est du Stock-Car entre fous furieux, pas de la Course Automobile...			",1,0,3,0,0,0,0

												Overall a good game, but there a some points that are incredibly annyoing after a while. The Handling is everything but realistic. You always start at the back, that mean you have to overtake the slow KI which is constantly blocking you on small tracks. The KI in first place wins distance in this time and its just luck when you have enough time in the last lap to overtake him. Then if you touch another Car, yours instantly loses control and you have to shift back. If another car touches you the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing happens. Feels like that their cars weight like 3tons and yours 200kg.			",25,0,5,1,1,0,0

												Played for a few hours, enough to get tired of the excessive drift in handling, a prominent feature of arcade racers, and that's not what I was looking for.Well, then I read some reviews and comments and there's this one, advicing to try GRID 1 instead. I did and, besides the lower quality graphics, the overall experience is way better, a lot closer to one of my favorite racing games: Shift Unleashed.So, if you empathize with this review, you should try GRID, being advised it's a little outdated, but still fun.

												You think that you play Grid, but people think that they play Burnout! Instead of going faster, and turning smoother; majority of people on multiplayer prefer to hit you in the back and make you go full 360. The sad part is that there is no way to punish these players in-game! They ruin your Grid experience, and gain advantage of that! Codemasters does not do anything about it, the game does not have publisher support. Singleplayer is fun though, but multiplayer is nothing more than rage control.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll be honest; i've never been a great racing sport fan in real life and same with the games.But THIS one was special. It has a really great mix between realistic car racing sportand the special ""fancy"" over-the-top drifting and overtaking moments!Really enjoyed the campaign and the many options to play this game! (SP, MP, Splitscreen, Custom Races)Would recommend EVERYone to try this game to see if they're into racing games.Also awesome with friends in multiplayer which is still played!

												Grid 2 is a racing game that rewards skill without punishing you for the tiniest mistakes, letting you master a simple system with a forgiving attitude. It may stray too close towards the easy side of the scale at times, and it'll be interesting to see how the game works online (which unfortunately wasn't tested in this review), but its career mode is well worth playing and you won't be satisfied until you've mastered every single corner.

												GRID 2 is the successor of the great GRID, one of the first titles of the genre to popularize in the current generation of consoles. The game franchise's debut game impressed by presenting cutting-edge graphics and good gameplay. The most highlighted in the title was the amazing effect of speed that the game offered players. Upon reaching certain levels of speeds, the vehicle presented light bumps and a beginning of a lack of control in every wrong move could result in a spectacular collision.In this way, the Codemasters started to become a reference in the genre, which eventually finalized with the release of titles like DiRT 3 and the official Formula 1 games. The downside of all this is that before games so well accepted by critics and by the players, GRID 2 hits the market with a greater good than other games of the producer.Fortunately, the company has done the homework and, on top of a new engine, brought practically the same game with minor improvements. What makes the game a must-have for fans of the genre, even in the final stretch of this generation of consoles.Grid 2 offers a lot of speed and game modesFetching the popularizing of your eventGRID 2 focuses on the evolution of the pilot in a competition, the WSR, which seeks to become a known event. For this, it is necessary to popularize the attraction, attracting more fans with incredible feats, how to win duels and disputadíssimas evidence. Every amount reached by public, create more evidence and the event gets even more prominence, even with calls on television shows. Of course it's a joke of a partnership between the company and an American sports channel.And just as in the first game, you must also fulfill objectives imposed by sponsors, ranging from finished the race in a given place, to perform feats within a race, how to overcome a certain number of opponents. Fulfilling these goals, more evidence and vehicles are released.Incredible variety of game modesGRID 2 has an amazing range of modalities that are part of both the main mode, when descompromissadas evidence. They are:Race common race mode where WINS who arrives in frontAgainst the clock race against the clock where you need to score the best time of the trackPopular Drift mode skid, where every you need slippage accumulates point. Add WINSElimination Proof in that every 20 seconds, the last placed is eliminatedOverdrive Exceed the maximum of opponents, without colisòes, to score pointsTougue Wins who open more than 5 second advantage over his opponent firstConfrontation Duels against an opponent where WINS who arrives in frontControl point Run to achieve the maximum possible checpoints and add a few seconds to your time. WINS who spend more time on the track.Resistance test with a particular overtime. WINS who is at first when this time finishEven so, none of them have so much prominence when the mode in which the path becomes totally random. That is, the player doesn't have a map and the straights and curves appear in a way unexpected. This requires a cautious and riding at the same time a lot of reflection.Pilotage in that you dictate the paceThe GRID 2 gameplay remains the high point of the game. Despite not running at 60 frames per second, it features movements which depict very well the realism of disputes at high speed, with a great progression of difficulty. In other words, while at the beginning of your journey, the cars, the tracks and the opponents are not terrifying, as the progress of the game, his skill is increasingly required, both to stay on the right path, how to get in front.Another interesting point of the game is the player's freedom to fly in their strokes. There are all kinds of curves for various vehicles, in this way, it is up to the player to opt for boldness or by doing the basics. That is, every moment you can decide by simply attacking a curve, requiring the maximum of brakes and tires, or just get around it the safest way possible-of course there are exceptions to everything, and some curves require much more accurate movements.The greatest proof of this freedom is the absence of the already popular auxiliary line. Virtually all racing games released in this generation include the famous coloured line showing the ideal stroke. With his absence in GRID 2, back to the old and traditional custom of get to know better the path before to master certain clues. But if the player still find some difficulty-or making a big error-replay mode, which remains intact, can be activated. It allows players to go back up to a certain point of the race, and can change their past movements.Visually, GRID 2 is even more beautiful			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Absolute ♥♥♥♥ing garbage. I can't even believe the♥♥♥♥♥♥that Codemasters is trying to pull by having made this game. This is literally a downgrade from Grid 1. I'm ♥♥♥♥ing stunned that this is even a game. Pros:looks niceCons:.Driving physics are stripped down and completely different resulting in a straight downgrade from the first game      .the handling is too sensitive. you drift simply by turning hard enough and the game has nothing but hairpin turns      .You HAVE to use the brake instead of the E-brake to drift.drifting is god awful.Simplified hud.default controller layout is changed for no reason and is worse. .Blatant advertising.dated references     .Seriously the first achievement you get is a reference to a 3-year old pop song. It's only going to get more dated as time goes on. .linear story mode     .Some♥♥♥♥♥♥is constantly yammering in my ear and attempting to stroke my ego while simultaneously screaming about     some stupid competition that I care nothing about and then proceeds to explain it to me like I've never played a racing game or watched a racing movie. .announcer/coach that holds your hand and patronizes you every step of the way no matter how bad you mess up.Forced account signup for some stupid network you're never gonna use.no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cockpit view.NO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ RACE DAY MODE     This is probably the worst part about the game. I could handle all of the above. Even the inferior handling but when you can't even stop the campaign to enjoy some laps by yourself and trying out new cars then it's not even worth playing. I don't know of any racing game and I sure as hell don't know any racing sims that doens't have a test track mode. -3/10. I paid next to nothing for this game and I still regret it.

												One of the most disappointing racing games for me. The first GRID was incredible and had a more semi-sim feeling to it where as GRID 2 is 100% arcade, something that is very unlike what Codemasters have been doing since the first Race Driver. The sponsors function has been changed completely, very dumbed down. And the absence of a decent monetary system is very disappointing. There's nothing left of what made the first GRID great.Thanks Codemasters for ruining a great game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm a pretty huge fan of racing games in general, and to be honest, I've played most of them too, whether it be forza, dirt, gran turismo, test drive, need for speed... you get the point. This game is truely up there with the rest. Codemasters have made yet another awesome title, however I can't stop thinking its Dirt on asphalt, the driving mechanics are very similar to Dirt, however they are very different to that of other racing games. To be honest, i'm not complaining tho, the driving is much smoother than most racing games and can become quite enjoyable after a while.GRID 2 provides an awesome variety of maps and enviroments from places in USA, Europe and Asia. Not to mention the cars, there is more than enough to choose from for each season and the difficulties are neither too hard, too easy... but just right, compared to that of Dirt 3 (way too easy).Although it may not have the open world gameplay of test drive unlimited, or the graphics in forza and it is hardly an improvement multiplayer, but with aggressive AI and enjoyable handling, Codemasters ensure that this game is always challeging, and there is more than enough hours of fun packed within this game.
