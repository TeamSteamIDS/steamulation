												I have played this series through most of it's incarnations. DDS: Pro Basketball 2017 is by far the best.If you are interested in a basketball GM sim, in the vein of Baseball Mogul or OOTP Baseball, or are a fan of management games, this game is the best basketball game available. In previous versions it was difficult to build teams using the draft, this version while not perfect offers a realistic team building experience. Occasionally you will find the next LeBron James or Stephen Curry, but more often then not you do not. You have a wide variety of stats to sift through including advanced stats like TS% and +/- stats. Often times a player's rating does not reflect their actual impact on the game and in this case carefully tweaking the roster can result in your team winning more games. Overall it is an accurate simulation of being an NBA basketball GM.I have put hours into this game and similar versions and overall I highly recommend the game for people who are into this genre. It is a lot better than the previous versions as far as statistical accuracy.PROS:Best Basketball Management Game on the Market.Fairly accurate stats.Computer generated players have relatively realistic statistics.Team chemistry matters.You can make expansion teamsTons of stats to sift throughConsYou can exploit CPU AI(To a degree, the CPU GMs are not complete idiots)Too many players play all 82 gamesThe D-League Draft takes too much time.Draft is a little too predictable, no random surprises in the 2nd round.Overall highly recommended. Much better than previous incarnations. ",20,6,0,11,24,1,11

												The 2017 iteration of DDSPB is a giant leap forward. I love the matchup feature pitting teams from different years against each other. The information is vast on players and as always easily accessible. As a long-time player of the game from version 1 this a nice addition to the library and will get some play on my computer. Now back to my 1984 Rockets with Sampson and Olajuwon.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
