												A+ game, quite possibly the best version yet.  If you love cricket you'll get plenty of hours out of it.  Value for money is incredible.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As always, this is an excellent cricket simulation game. Unlike the last few versions, this one has some much needed new features/improvements. To name just a few, the added Indian domestic leagues (which will please many). The ODI and T20 match engines have notably improved with much larger scores now possible. The lesser teams like Bangladesh and Zimbabwe have been given more attention leading to more accurate team selections. There are many more little improvements for the better that you will find out as you play the game.Overall, I honestly think this is a game to get for any cricket fan.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There are many fantastic new features including fielding coaching, new leagues, new stadiums, pitches and graphics, as well as a really accurate game engine across all three formats.If you love cricket, then you HAVE to get this game!I will post more after I have clocked up more hours!

												I'm very pleased to say that this year's Cricket Captain is probably the biggest step forward the series has seen to date - they've eliminated a lot of stupid bugs that have been in the game for ages, and their 3d graphics actually look pretty okay now, with added shadows etc. The match engine has always been the key of the game, though, and it too has been updated to better reflect the aggressive cricket of the modern era, throwing up fantastic results that mirror real life in an unpredictable way, such that old Cricket Captain games would not have been able to manage.8/10, biggest improvement I've ever seen in the series.

												Cricket Captain 2015, the same game every year with given a tiny application of makeup and making no progress whatsoever. The thing is, Cricket Captain is basically a Cricket Manager game, minus 90% of management features that are needed to make the game interesting. But let me get the pro's out of the way with first;The match engine is brilliant, the statistical information available to the player is brilliant. The one-day and 20-20 match engines have been tweaked and are better than previous instalments. Graphics have finally gotten a facelift, but animations remain the same as in previous versions pretty much, thus edges mostly go in the same areas and not always to shots that make sense.To demonstrate the laziness; the animations for the umpires to signal 'byes' is the real life signal for leg byes, this has been like this for the past three or four instalments, it can't be that hard to fix surely?Outside of the match engine, there is almost nothing for an aspiring manager to do. Yeah, there is team building from the transfer market, and the promotion of youth players. You also get to adjust the budgets a little, but the initial funding doesn't change (aside from prize money), there's no opportunity to build the club up as you become more successful. There's no chance to look more in depth at a youth or reserve team, and you can't hire a specific number of physios or coaches. Training is limited, staff numbers are linked to the budget but never anymore than numbers rather than actual personalities themselves - a batting coach who is aggressive for example, or a bowling coach with his own philosophy - nope, they're just generic numbers.And that, really is the problem with the game. It's a spreadsheet game, with all your time spent looking at statistical averages. Best batsman number 1 will always be replaced by generic youth product number 51, because there are no personalities in the game, nothing to indicate ability (outside of averages), nothing to indicate talent (outside of averages) because there's no staff to talk to, no youth team to develop and team to mould in line with bigger games such as Football Manager.The whole thing, is just a numbers game without any real flavour to it. The hardcore fans and cricket nuts will pick it up as usual, but aside from reading the numbers and possibly playing around with tactics in the admittedly decent match engine there's nothing outside to keep things interesting, no media, no discussions, no personalities, training events or anything that adds spark and interest. Nothing but your imagination and the bland numbers popping up as each match goes by.For a series that has been around for a long while now, they really need to get with the times and produce something more than a match engine.
