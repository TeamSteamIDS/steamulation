												Very fun to look at and very fun to play. Terrific party game. Good for 2-4 players and an audience. Lovely, clean aesthetic, great sound design, great music, great humor.The main mechanic is that you can stretch or shrink your tube-person to control the ball or your opponent. The more you stretch, the more ball control you have, but the less pushing power you have. By shrinking, you sacrifice some ball control in exchange for more pushing power. You'll frequently be switching between offensive and defensive tactics during a match, so adjust your tube-person accordingly. (That's a sentence I never thought I'd say)Multiple game modes, and if you find the secret, you can play as weiner dogs. :-)Lovely thing. Can't recommend enough. Pick up this game, pick up a pizza, have some friends over, and have a blast.			",396,105,34,16,28,4,20

												I've been playing this game at public events in Melbourne since about 2014 and fell in love with it at first sight.If you can get past the strange snake people this game is so soft, cuddly, and beautiful.If you enjoy games with a lot of tense, hillarious, silly, and just plain awesome moments then this is definitely the game for you! There's a surprising amount of depth in something so simple. I've discussed countless times with people i've played this with about the games tactics, counter moves, strong and weak stratergies, etc and it just never gets old.I haven't played any of their newer modes with multiple balls or different rule sets so i can't speak to much about those. However the original two sides of a sphere mode I could talk in depth about for hours!If you enjoy laughing, crying, and yelling witth your friends, then this 'big cuddle simulator' is the game for you :)also dog mode is fantastic and the music is catchy as hell too :p			",121,42,0,19,15,1,14

												Entertaining game, if not a bit pricey for what it is. Incredibly simplistic, which has pros and cons. On one side, it lets you jump right into the game, making it great for party settings. However, there are no options to customize your controls, so if an issue arises you could be ♥♥♥♥ out of luck. Overall I'm a fan of the game. It's hilarious, controls are intuitive, and very fun. But if you're going to buy it, maybe wait for a discount.			",71,5,0,4,3,1,2

												A simplistic and fun game to play with friends. The game is great to play in groups, but that's all that it has going for it. The game has a great soundtrack, and the current game modes are pretty fun.The only downsides to the game are that it's a bit pricey for what it is, and I feel that there could be some more modes. Other than that, the game is quite fun and I'd recommend it if it goes on sale.			",45,1,0,6,1,0,5

												One of the funniest local multiplayer games I've played in a long time. Get some friends together and play this game. It is a hilarious game for spectators, as well. We played this at our local multiplayer game night and it was a big hit. It reminds me of Sports Friends - another vector cartoon, goofy competitive local multiplayer game.			",371,74,5,25,35,4,29

YouTube™ Video: Pee Me Pee You! (Push Me Pull You) 

			Views: 194		

			""Push Me Pull You"" is a 2-4 player arena game playable with 1-4 controllers. Basically, you need to show the other people who is boss by taking control of the ball. That's about it.		

This is a tough game to recommend. We stumbled on it today and thought ""Hey! Let's give it a shot. Why not?!"" And there are some laughs to be had, for sure. The downside, however, is that the gameplay really doesn't last long. You'd be hard-pressed to get more than an hour of enjoyment with this game, even as a ""Noisy party"" game setting like description suggests. The goal of the game is to simply hold the ball in the middle of the round arena on your side until you score a point. There is a little bit of strategy involved, where if you shrink your character you become heavier and harder to push, and longer makes it easier to wrap up the ball. Pros: Some geniune laughs to be hadUp to 4 players with 2 controllersCons:There is no online multiplayerController only4 Levels (cosmetic differences) - plus a warm-up zoneNo single playerPriceBasically, for the amount of content, it's hard to justify the price of $15, especially considering it's ONLY a party game. It falls short, feeling like it's only one Mini-game that should have been part of a larger set.So we reluctantly recommend this game so long as all your friends are pitching in to help you buy it.
