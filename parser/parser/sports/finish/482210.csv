												Sure, I wish that the players moved, but overall the physics in this game are really good and I love trying to beat my high score.			",25,6,3,2,15,7,0

												Fun game, easy to learn.  You really have to use your arm and THROW it!  Good exercise.  It will be cool when the targets move, lots of potential.			",16,10,1,0,4,1,0

												Game its self isn't bad. Mechanics are decent, and visual are surprisingly great. The problem with it is the amount of content. There are two modes, practice and play (practice but timed). There is nothing other than throwing at still targets. No pass rush, no receivers, no plays or defense. As a huge football fan I wish I could enjoy the game and give it a positive review, but in its current state I can not.Edit: I should mention, the game would be worth around $5 max, I would reccomend the game around that price. But with the game currently being $20...its a hard sell			",20,9,1,0,15,1,1
