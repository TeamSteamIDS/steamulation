												It breaks my heart to give this a thumbs down.I am an independent professional wrestler, so the subject matter of this game is extremely interesting to me. I love the idea of playing a game as a struggling Indy wrestler trying to make it in a cutthroat and difficult business. Indy wrestling is driving 250 miles to get paid $20 to wrestle some has been who thinks he's too good for you and intentionally makes you look bad. Its about passion and love for the carefully constructed performance art that is professional wrestling.This however offers nothing to simulate that experience. Instead, you have a completely luck based system that in my few hours of play seems heavily and consistently biased toward the CPU (the last match I played I did five strikes early in the match, calculation gave each around an 80% chance to hit, four missed). You face no name indy wrestlers that inexplicably have unbeleivable statistics and are seemingly impossible to beat because of the luck based gameplay determined by the statistics. There is no incorporation of match psyychology, or anything to make this a pro wrestling simulator in the least bit. Worst of all, the performance art aspect of pro wrestling is completely lost in this game. Your success is measured exclusively by your win/loss record. Putting on a great match is absolutely meaningless unless you win, and the matches are simulated completely as competition rather than performance art. I don't understand how GreyDog can simulate pro-wrestling so well in TEW and so poorly in this game. If you are looking for a great pro wrestling simulator go for TEW 2013. And if you want to experience the life of an aspiring wrestler, either play WWE 2K16 or train to wrestle yourself. It will be easier and less frustrating than this game.			",132,77,1,68,68,3,25

												DO NOT BUY!This game is blatantly advertised wrong.Most of the features listed as ""Career Features"" are not included in the game. I have the feeling that the description is more accurate to the (by far superior) predecessor Wrestling Spirit 2.Unfortunately you may sink hours into the editor (trying to include reallife stats and such) and creating your own wrestler with the moveset you see fit, before you even get into your first day of your career, which means that once you figure out how much of an empty shell this game is, you are not eligible for a refund, because you had the program running for more then 2 hours.So if you want a game like this, with these features I encurage you to head over to greydogsoftware's homepage and buy Wrestling Spirit 2 from their shop (which is ironically even 5$ cheaper then this).

												The learning curve for this game is steep. The ability to counter moves supposedly is simple, but the random dice rolls destroy any chance of you actually mounting a defense.An example would be blocking. They compare your strength to your opponents strike, and then generate a random # to compare it to your opponent's strike score. If your strength is 478 and your opponent's is 20, that would mean you should have a decent chance to block right?Wrong. He potatoed me a couple of times, and I was rolling 23s and 46s out of 200 or even 1000. Your starting character is just above the enhancement talent, but even then, you struggle to beat them.I was more looking for a game where you book matches, and tell a story in the ring to get crowd reaction, as opposed to just selecting moves and hoping for the best. I could play the WWE game and do what this game does, and have less frustration.			",62,14,0,10,17,3,37

												i have not played this game for hours and hours yet.it has alot to do with using your mind and thinking king of like chess.i think they are heading in the right road.but it can make you very mad early in the game.it need rpg twist to it.leveling up would be fun i think.i need to get deeper into the game.training would be awesome like a gym.i think live action telling your wrestler what to do during the maches.seeing them grow from training.signing contracts.like i said i need to go deeper in this game.but it's not easy starting off.i like building my wrestler ground up.this game has alot to empress me yet.but i'll give it a fair chance it has lot of cool ideas.

												Don't expect this game to be like TEW, whatever you do. You'll absolutely hate this game if you come in with the impression this game is a super in-depth simulator because really it's just a text based version of the WWE 2K Career mode which obviously isn't for everyone. I recommend this to people who just want a straight forward game.			",78,14,1,16,16,1,9
