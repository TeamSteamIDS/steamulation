Early Access Review
								Hey! I am a member of TEAM ROCKETS so my review would be biased and terrible for you. But we would like to hear your feedback; we check the steam forums many times a day!But if you want to know what I really think about ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS, let's get *serious* for a moment.I've been a game developer for many years. A lot of times you work on an exciting idea that seems like it might work, and a lot of times you work on things just out of momentum, and sometimes you wake up and discover you're working on something you should have cancelled months ago. It's sorta the way life goes, as a developer; it's hard to objectively see what you are working on as anything but ""good."" A lot of the time it's hard to even find playtesters to help you out.Sometimes, though - rarely - an idea comes along that hits you like falling in love does. You jump out of bed every day to work on it. You can't stop thinking about it. The whole world gets more vibrant, and you see your idea everywhere. Everyone you show the early prototypes to instantly get it and also fall in love. You start gaining fans and all you have is a title screen or a doodle on a napkin... And they aren't friends or family. This kind of experience is incredibly rare, and I am stupendously honoured to be feeling it for ROCKETS right now.I know I'm in the thick of it right now, and I still have those rose-colored glasses on, but I think I will fondly look back on ROCKETS for the rest of my life. It may not be my best technical work, it may be unfinished right now, and it may not become a commercial success (I'm writing this before the Early Access launch!), but by golly does this game feel right in every way.It feels incredible to build, it feels incredible to play, and it feels incredible to be a part of this talented team.I hope you'll fall in love with the game like I did.

								ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS is exactly what the title implies. You fly around in a rocket and prove to others who is the studliest of all the rockets. Here's a Quick Look video if you want to see how this game plays. There's also my review below if you simply want a more in-depth and concise look at the game. 


YouTube™ Video: ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS Quick Look 

			Views: 3,251		

			Watch Noble of Lost Pause take a quick look at ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS. As you may have suspected, it's about rockets. But not just any rockets. Dogfighting rockets!		

Let me start my review by saying this game is extremely bare at this point. It only has local dogfighting between 2 rockets, 2 v 1 underdog mode, or team deathmatch. But damn is the dogfighting good. You get three different ways to attack: by shooting lasers that go straight ahead, dropping bombs that fling out your side and are effected by gravity, and finally mines that shoot out your backside and blow up behind you. Simple right? But try throwing that in with high-speed rocket action. Suddenly you have to plan your shots to cut off the path your enemy is flying. Did the enemy drop a mine? Knock it right back at him with a laser and laugh in his face. Wanna rain death on a pursuer? Fling bombs into the sky and try to weave away from the hail of death. It's simply fun experimenting and trying to become the best pilot. And trust me, you'll always know who is the better pilot. You simply can't win the game based solely on luck. You have to dominate your opponent with the tag system they implemented. Basically put, both sides start from scratch, and if you hit the enemy 3 times in a row, it's your win. But if he hits you once, he'll knock a tag off your streak that you'll have to make up for until you fill the gauge in the top of the screen. This means games can end quickly, or be an intense test of endurance between two evenly-matched pilots.Another great point of this game is the visuals. I love painting the cosmos with my vapor trails. Not only does it enhance the sense of speed you're getting, but it also tells the tale of the dance of death the rockets have been through. And when I say dance, I mean it. The music in this game is super catchy, too.But let's discuss some negatives now. Just keep in mind that his is Early Access, and most of this will probably get changed in future patches.*The game is super short in its current state (you do everything there is to do once you play your first match). It's just dogfighting. And while it's good, it might not be enough to sell it at this point for some people.*There is no progression or anything to unlock. Something that'll keep the player coming back for more is always knowing they'll get rewarded if they play more.*All the rockets are the same, just colored differently. I'd like to have different looking rockets just for cosmetic purposes at least. Just something to make me feel unique.*No upgrades to weapons. I'm not talking flat out upgrades that are better than another, but more of something that makes them act differently. Like a laser that fires faster but has limited range. Or a mine that explodes in a larger radius but you can't shoot out as many. Just something to make this game more strategic and diverse would be good.*No online. This will be fixed later, but it'll remain a negative until it's implemented.*No tutorial. Sure it's fun flying around and getting absolutely owned by the AI for the first few times, but some sort of menu to list the controls would be nice.*No options menu. You can't change the sound effects, resolution, or anything else ingame currently.Now while that may be a lot of negatives, most--if not all--of those while be ironed out in the future. So wait until then if they bother you.So to wrap this up, this game is going to bud into something very good. And for the low cost of $5 they're handing it out for currently, it certainly worth picking it up even now.*As a side note, I will (hopefully) update this review as major patches are released or just do it again once it's finally released. Just yell at me and I'll come running to take another look if I forget.*			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Update: 14 months after ""full"" release the developers updated the game, removing/adding the missing ""coming soon"" content and fixed the resolution bug.Original: This is an unfinished game that is *not* labeled early access. Despite the game being fully released, many menu items say ""coming soon"" but the developers seem to no longer be updating the game.


When is soon?

												I am deeply sadden by this game, because I have never seen such a great potential for a game to be something amazing that was never achieved. Rockets does something that few other games do, it takes a concept, simplifies it, and then perfects it. When you play this game, you find yourself in one of the best feeling, looking, and joy filling games you will ever play, so why is it bad? This game may have some of the best combat you will ever experience, but you can do nothing with it. Imagine Rockets like an towering skyscraper, it is jaw dropping, beautiful, and unbreakable. So what is the problem with the building? Well the thing is empty! There is no furniture, no colors, no substance. They have laid the ground work for one of the biggest games we could ever see, but they have left their foundation completely empty. There is two game modes, (Both of which are just the basic battle with different health systems.) one AI, four maps, and thats really it, where as what the game doesn't have is more customization, more single player ability, and ONLINE! Why would you not give this game online, that just doesn't make sense! I hate to see such an amazing game go down in history as just another indie game, just because it didn't give people enough to talk about, but here it is, and here is will stay. The perfect recipe for something amazing that they just didn't take the time to make into a dish.			",27,1,0,4,4,0,0

Early Access Review
It's on sale! Do not hesitate, just buy!Read the tl;dr section if you want at the bottom(too long; didn't read)Better ViewReview will be updated periodically. [Last Update: 21:27 PM(EST) June 18th, 2014]I discuss: What is R3, the gameplay, music, and even the developer for those of you who are worried about Early Access. ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS. I haven't had more fun with a game in awhile, and I have a lot of games. However, I will not make this review solely based on praising the game, but to get a better idea of what the gameplay is like I will explain all the core mechanics and aspects of the game. Pictures will not help you, you must try this out for yourself.What is ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS?R3 is a rocket flying arcade shooter, where you shoot rockets at other rockets. Currently there is one single gamemode with local only, but don't let this dissapoint you. All my hours are with its smart 1v1 AI that faces a huge challenge at first. Games can go either way everytime. R3 relies on quick twitch mechanics with its easier to learn gameplay and controls. The learning curve flows very nicely where you will be able to play decently after a couple of hours, but you will always get better. You have three weapons.Standard Rockets(You will use this most of the time.)Drop Rockets(These are advanced and even I have trouble using them. Many people accidentally hit themselves with it. It takes practice.)- They drop using physics, so based off your momentum and gravity,the rockets will drop different ways. Usually you want to use this when the enemy is far below you.Mine(Static mine that pops out behind you.)The neat part about R3 is its controls. They aren't relative. Up goes upward, right goes right, etc. This means you have true freedom in how you move. You can pull of neat turns and dodge obstacles at fast speeds. Hitting someone can be sometimes very difficult. You have a shield that you activate with a button, it only comes on for about a second and will promptly dissapear. Rockets can't get through your shield but mines can. This helps prevent your uninvitable doom when faced with a barrage of rockets that you realize you can not dodge. It also gives you a little boost, and has a cooldown, so you better be careful when using it.The standard gamemode is an advantage system. Whoever has a +3 advantage in hits wins. Your opponent has 2 points and you hit them. They now have 1 point and you still have 0. When they are back at 0 you can now score. This gamemode influences long high octane battles, however if this sounds off to you still consider getting it as the developer plans to add more gamemodes.Now what about the Developer!?The lead Developer Andy Moore is probably one of the best Early Access indie devs I've seen that not only is commited to adding lots of content, but making sure everyone has an enjoyable experience. Don't be afraid that this game will not work for you, he always puts out experimental builds that you can opt into to try and listens to every complaint you have.He's not the type of developer that goes, ""I like feedback, but I'm not going to actually use said feedback"". He updates in a regular and timely manner and is always in the discussions on the forum.So don't be afraid to put your money into this project. Infact I encourage you because the price will get higher upon release. Yes, this does seem off putting to a lot of you. However, the game is fairly polished and always recieving updates. They have plans for after release also. No, this won't end up being $60(DayZ... really?). My guess is $10 - $15.Hot JamsThe music in this game is absolutely wonderful. It's composed by Power Up Audio, who did the music for Towerfall: Ascension and many others. Check them out! It features upbeat electro space jams. You can listen to it all day. I swear. It currently only includes 4 tracks. Menu theme and two in-game themes and a 2 part win theme. All are good and mastered well. They are adding in more music, but you can tell by the quality that they put effort into it.What's not good about R3- Currently it has a limited options menu(which will be improved soon.)- It needs a bit more polish on the UI, it's very clean and neat however it's missing a good amount of stuff.- The game is in Early Access so AI is only complete for 1v1, but they are now testing multi AI currently so I wouldn't worry about it. Honestly, the game is best for 1v1. You will probably most likely play 1v1. Any higher is for more advanced players. Alright, I can't think of anymore problems.Will this game support my controller and keyboard!?Most likely: Yes. Literally every recent update he has added support for a bunch of random controllers I've never even heard off. Keyboard controls are good at the moment, but are always getting better. What should I be warned about before buying?It's Alpha mate. Things change.What I'm worried about in the FutureMultiplayer NetccodeThis game features a lot of collision and player interaction which is why it must have a good netcode. Netcode is the reason I haven't purchased Brawlhalla. I do expect on Multiplayer release the netcode to be very shoddy, however I hope the developers will work very hard on it, and based on my comment on the dev,  I'm sure he will.I hope this doesn't require any of our own servers like many indie games have been doing lately. A Peer-to-peer lobby or universal servers will be better.What I need you to do.Buy this game. It won't be good without players. Don't hold off and get it. $5, and you're getting it at a cheaper price than release also. Hate the idea of paying developers for alpha testing? Remember when games didn't tell you they were incomplete till you bought them? You're supporting development and helping this game get out there and faster. By buying in you allow them to afford a multitude of things that will go back into the game. Servers, advertisement, features, music. Just do it.In current development I give R3 a: 7/10 Unique!Gameplay and Controls: 10 Best!Settings and UI: 5/10 AverageAnd I don't do that BS where 7 is average. 5 is average on my scale. Have fun Rocketeers!tl;dr+ Well polished.+ Frequent Updates+ Dedicated Devloper who releases Expiremental builds to ensure all users are having fun. Have a problem? Just post in the forum, a build will be out in seconds!+ Hot Jams+ Great Controls and pacing+ Support for everything+ Learning Curve+ Button Mashing is actually fun?- Limited Setting(at the moment!)- Missing a couple of in-game UI elements- Only two modes avaliable-------12:30 AM(EST) May 18th, 2014-------Andy is allowing the community to edit the level generation, controls, physics, and more with a new file. We're all testing different outcomes of how we believe R3 should play like.-------21:27 PM(EST) June 18th, 2014-------So R3 Module One update hit for all users not in the Experimental build a few days ago. After getting my testing in the amount of stuff added is great. NA new challenge mode has been added with leaderboards and a couple of new styles for everything. Also more hot jams!

Early Access Review
								This game is very fun.. once you know the controls. At first I was very confused with how I controlled my rocket, thinking it was relative, but then I realized the up arrow goes up, down arrow goes down, left goes left, and right goes right. Okay, I had that figured out, but then I needed to figure out how to shoot. Space? No. Shift? No, that's a weird shield thing. Control? Nope. X? Nah. Z? Nope! D? Ah, that shoots rockets. I then started pressing WASD to see what it would do. A shoots smaller rockets, and S drops bombs. Also, my resolution is stuck at 800x600, for some reason. This game needs an options menu, or even just a seperate executable to change the resolution. For positive, well, the music is amazing!! This game is also very beautiful, and fast paced. It has a feel to it... It's great. And the light trails, wow. The AI is very smart, also. Still haven't won a battle.Anyway, this is a great game, and has a lot of potential for future multiplayer, but I feel it needs a tutorial and some options.Pick it up, though, it's worth it!EDIT: It seems the developer added some settings! That's great, he even added a controls page. I'm loving the game and it fixed most of its problems! I know that this game will be also very good for the keyboard in the future, because right now it seems the developer still seems uncertain about the current controls. Hoping for the best! Again, it's a great game, worth the money, pick it up!			",95,15,7,14,12,1,10

												ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS is hands down the most entertaining way to get carpal tunnel playing couch co-op. It has beautiful aesthetics and is quite enjoyable to play with a friend, against the AI, or even in the more pacifist Zen mode flying around and making art with rocket trails. The combat is simple, intuitive, and amazing, with three projectiles and a dash maneuver which allow for diverse gameplay. You can shoot missles, leave nasty mines, and drop bombs to cause beautiful, beautiful havoc. I'm not kidding. It's quite beautiful watching the brightly colored projectiles and stages blossom with bright, cheerful explosions as your enemies spin, hit by your barrage of missles and bombs or blasted by a mine. There is a lot of potential for skill, but even beginners can play without too much barrier.Pros:Fun gameplayBeautiful (minimalist) graphicsGreat game modesCouch versus, co-op vs bots, and Zen modeCons:High risk of intense button mashing, play at your own risk.No online multiplayer (and, given the intense speed of matches, it makes sense, though it would be amazing if it existed)Basically requires a controller- playable on keyboard and mouse, but much less fun.I highly recommend this game if you have a friend nearby or just want to relax and unwind against a bot or in Zen mode.

												Ill be honest, I bought this game with the intent to try it out and then return it. What i experienced when i booted up that first game instantly changed that. This is a phenominally simple game, but it is SO MUCH FUN. Pros:Killer Soundtrack.Simplistic and beautiful.Easy to grasp controls.Amazing game for couch co-op or multiplayer.Intense Dogfights. Like Intense!Incredibly Fun! Cons:There isnt a whole lot of variety, theres one level and one mode(with the addition of a ""Zen"" aka drawing mode and a tournament mode, that facillitates that play style but isnt a unique gmae mode)Nothing to spice up the level, yeah the slow down and speed up drops are cool, but they dont change the game in anyway, just make it slower or faster. I'd like to see some special one use weapons or shields drop occasionally.In my opinion, the camera comes in close to quickly, its a bit jarring durin the fight and distracting.Overal, It impressed me enough that Radial Games can keep my money. Definitely a great game to play with friends.TL;DR Great Game, Great soundtrack. Little lacking on Content.  7/10 Buy this game. ",325,83,4,35,24,1,32

MUSICMUSICMUSICHeed the suggestion upon launch—play this game with a controller. You will not have a good time playing this with a keyboard.The gameplay is really repetitive—even playing with friends gets tedious. This isn't helped by the fact that the maps don't offer any variety. However, the thing that's keeping me from giving the game a thumbs down is the stunning neon art and effects, sound production, and best of all—the soundtrack. Kudos to Ben Lam for making great music! I wish you could just grab the soundtrack but I'd say the $10 deluxe edition is worth it just for the music alone.6/10			",222,77,3,40,25,2,19

Early Access Review
								I mainly bought this game because I was a fan of the game 3918 (Humble Bundle Mojam 2). Albeit awesome controls in 3918, ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS does not have the same/similar controls. In 3918 your mouse would control your rocket. The further your mouse got from the rocket, the more acceleration would be used. Controls:I am not all together disappointed with the controls of RRR, and I'm willing to take a learning curve. The game is quite bare at the moment, though I can't really complain, because It's Early Access, and I'm sure the Devs will make various revisions to the current game's state, to boot I did only pay about $2.50 a copy realistically. I'm excited to see where the game goes, and possible revisions to the mouse and keyboard controls as I do not own a controller, which is the currently recommended by RRR.Weapons/Bombs/Physics/Etc:Not disappointed at all, Physics/reactions to being hit are appropriate, music/sound affects are good.It's Early Access so take it with a grain of salt, I don't know how often the Devs intend on pushing out updates, but for the current price and the hope of future revisions and addons to it's current state, ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS is well worth $5.

												A waste of money, it's a great game per se but after ten minutes you find it so repetitive, also there was a promised multiplayer, but THEY DIDN'T SAY that it was LOCAL multiplayer until they released it.Pros: -Lovely Graphics-Lovely Physics-Decent AICons:-Repetitive-Too expensive for what it is-I bought it before they said the multiplayer was just LocalIf you find it with a big discount like -70% I would recommend it ",318,77,10,37,12,5,37

												The game is fun, but I think there needs to be an online multiplayer, I have barely played the game for an hour and it is starting to get boring without the online multiplayer. All in all, its a fun arcade game, but it needs some additions tto be worth 7 dollars.			",26,0,3,2,1,0,0

Early Access Review
								EDIT :   Changed from negative to positive on 3/1/2015.  Dev replied.   The devs are listening and are working on the game in a positive way, so im sure that it is headed in a good direction.  The regular game is still a thumbs down, for now, but most of my issues with it have been addressed in the beta version.  The beta version is playable for me with bloom turned off but imo its just not the same without it.Changes included in beta version detailed at the bottom. .............................................................................................................................................................RECCOMENDATION :  YES : I would wholeheartedly reccommend this game a few months ago, but not anymore.   I am writing this review with the hopes of getting the devs attentions, youve made an amazing game and I want to point out some things so that i can play it again.  I completely reccommend this game at 5$, but only after below said issues are fixed.   Review will be updated as changes happen.     Sound: 8/10Graphics: 8/10Gameplay: 8/10Bloom: 2/10Controls: 6/10OVERALL: 6/10 for now...............................................................................................................................................................GAMEPLAY :  Rocketsx3 is a great PvP multiplayer game. Can be played against bots as well.  You can play upto 4 player but the experience is best with 2. You could play 4 on a TV pretty well.   You control a ship and you have 3 weapons.  Mines, missiles, and  bombs.  Each of these attacks can be fired one at a time, or charged and released to dish out a devastating barrage of your weapon of choice.    Mines launch behind you and detonate in an area after a while.  Missiles launch directly in front of you and shoot forward.     Bombs are like tiny missiles but have no thrust, so they fall off from the side of your rocket.You get a sheild that also functions as a speed boost, allowing you to block attacks or get out of a tight situation.  First to 3 hits in a row wins! You can hit yourself and that deducts from your score.   Controlling your ship may be hard at first but youll get the hang of it.  Gameplay is fast, solid, and fluid.  Matches are usually short but may last longer. And boy are those longer matches tense.   Dodging missiles, falling for mine traps, using bombs to block your escape, a well timed charge attack to get two hits in a row or that moment when you engage eachother in a tense spiral of death.     Graphics are great, a very beautiful and neon art style, and the announcer ingame is great. A female, robotic assistant type voice.  The AI is amazing and WILL beat you many times. ................................................................................................................................................................COMPLAINTS :  I used to love this game. I played it  everyday with a good friend of mine. Both of us have stopped playing this game now due to changes made to it over successive updates that has left the game unplayable for us.  These reasons are :  1) WAY too bright. The brightness of the ship burner and particles, as well as environment objects and trails was multiplied by 20.   There should be a slider for this.  I miss the darkened out trails that the game had in the beginning, the bright trails before the christmas update were fine too, but it became WAY too sparkly after that. no reason that this cant be optional.   2) Difficult to fight in tight spaces now.  Due to the changes to particles and brightness, when you clash with eachother in tight corners or against walls, you cant tell what is going on.   3) Unncessary clutter added.  Your health is depicted by 3 balls around your ship. I feel that this adds unncessary clutter to the game and takes away from your focus.  I prefer the healthbar at the top. No reason why this cant be an option.  4) Screen size  : I play this game on my 21 inch 1980x1080 desktop, where the game is just about playable in its current state.   On my  1366x768 laptop though, i cant see anything anymore.    5) The background was darkened out to try and fix the visibility issue i reckon,  and it looks plain terrible.  6) The pulsating rocket trail. Please no.    7) The last life slowdown. Let this be an option. It takes away from the fast paced fun of the game for me.. Totally kills the mood, although it is cool sometimes.  Could be an optional powerup or 5th button.  ..............................................................................................................................................................CONCLUSION : Options are your best friend. Please dont just remove something and replace it with something else entirely.   Some poeple prefer one thing over another.  Online play will be coming to this game later on im sure.  On a positive note the UI work is great. Always improving. The music score is also nice.There is no problem in the gameplay , but how the game is visually presented has totally gimped it for me and made it unplayable. If you could provide me with an older build of this game, I'd much rather play that than what is on the steam store right now.   I dont have any reviews on my account, but i care enough about this game to write this out.  Your feedback on this review would be much appreciated.  Heres hoping a dev replies or these issues are addressed.       ................................................................................................................................................................EDIT :     CHANGES IN THE BETA VERSION OF THE GAME :   The beta build of the game includes a lot of improvements, which are :  1)   A bloom and rocket trail slider.  The lowest setting in bloom is still too high for me, its the same as the regular game.  The bloom slider is overkill. http://i.imgur.com/IyQAukE.gifv2) Tug of war is back!  But if you prefer the health bubbles, you now have bubble size, rotation speed, and distance from ship.  3) An option to enable/disable speedup/slowdown  pickups.  Though there is a bug that the pickups still appear in game, they just dont do anything. Other misc things  and comments :   I still find the game more difficult to play than pre christmas update. Colors are brighter? The particles? I cant pin it down for sure without playing an old build again but here are my comments :  The pulsating rocket trail and environment objects distracts me.  Also, i still prefer the discolored rocket trails.   The speed boost sparks are something id want to turn off too.   In the tug of war end game timer, white on white is too difficult to see.  Its hard to tell how much time you have left, please change that.    No 1980x1080 resolution in the beta build, but thats a minor gripe. A new gameplay feature i noticed that i DID like, is that you can now visibly see when a rocket is charging an attack. Awesome.  But instead of the white lines that indicate this, a colored outerglow or border so that its easier to see?    Progress is going well, i look forward to it.			",356,86,12,14,18,6,28

								FANTASTICLY ENTERTAINING! A bit ""bare"" at the moment, but lots of fun still! Only difficulty i encountered during play was the fact that when I connected my controller before starting the game, I got automatically set up against the computer. But when I connected it during play the 2-player mode was activated. A bit complicated, but we worked it out! Looking forward to the updates :)			",118,24,2,21,19,0,15

								Very early access game right now; super barebones. However, lots of fun to be ad here with the insanely difficult AI, and when online MP is introduced, it is sure to be a blast.Update from Early Access:Gameplay here is still rock solid. The online modes look to be alot of fun, and so far the game has only improved gameplay wise.Visually, however; not so much.Menus have gone from the sleek, minimalist approach from Early Access to cluttered, dare I say ""ugly"" designs. While functional, it looks more like a Flash game from the 00's rather than a fast and furious arcade shmup. This transition is applied in game as well; previously a nice, solid background with vibrant solid colored walls gave the game a minimalistic yet attractive view in game. It made seeing you're rockets and missles alot easier. However, it has since been replaced by a black on blue background filled with squares; while some might find this look to be great, it looks ""unprofessional"" for lack of a better term, once again losing the charm that had hooked myself and others originally.At the current state the game is fun to play, but the stark contrast between 6 months ago and now has left the game looking worse off. This does not mean it IS worse off; real beuaty is on the inside (Gameplay), but the outside layer on this game has turned myself and several other friends who I convinced to buy this title in Early Access off for the time being.

								A very nice game. I particularly like the colors and dogfight mode (which is extremely challenging, even against the AI). My only gripe is that I suffer from motion sickness with the camera constantly zooming in and out - a setting to make the camera zoom less (or not at all) would make this game better.P.S. - use a controller.

								ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS is a game about firing rockets at other rockets and occasionally you will need to fire rockets at rockets that the enemy rocket has fired. confused. Imagine ballet with rockets and mines and drop rockets. you see a swarm of rockets coming towards you so you dodge and then spin and you leave niffty trails behind you and all together make a really nice piece of art while firing rockets at another rocket. This game is cheap and worth the money. Dont buy a real rocket they are just money grabs and are overrated.			",57,2,1,0,4,0,3

								This game has the most fun local multiplayer matches I've experienced in a long time. It's very simple, but extremely fun. Plus, the visuals are gorgeous fit great with the music / sound effects. If you have a couple of controllers for your PC and a friend to play 1v1 with, I highly recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
