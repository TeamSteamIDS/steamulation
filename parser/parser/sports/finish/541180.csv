												Played one match, here is my takeaway from it. If Konami decides to give us the lesser version of the game next year, they might as well keep it off the platform. This is embarassing. The character models look atrocious. The gameplay is good, possibly superior to FIFA but it takes an L everywhere else. Definitely not recommending this game. Plus they skipped out on Data pack 2 apparently for PC. Complete downvote here.			",152,19,8,27,21,5,17

												I would not pay 30+ Euros for this game but since MyClub is the only mode i want to play this trial version is exactly what i need. Gameplay even if its not perfect. AI might be a bit better but all in all its totally ok especially if you keep in mind you dont have to pay anything to play the game. I focus on playing vs AI and some games vs other players (short tournaments, weekly events). If you only want to play vs other players one thing should be said: there might be some lags and its delayed depending on where the other guy lives and his internet connection, which really sucks sometimes. All in all a good game though. Its a bit better than PES2016. Give it a try			",49,1,3,8,2,1,4

												A good game with some issues that Konami need to fix. It's basically a F2P version on myClub and that's great! Konami should probably update their title to show that. Now gameplay is classic PES, Feels much better than Fifa and you have a lot more control over the ball. The ball feels nicely weighted and moves along the grass nicely. There is no overpowered lofted through balls or crosses for easy goals you have to play from the back and build up your attack. There aren't many players atm (around 2,000 at peak times) But even with only 500 players online it only takes me around 1-2 mins to get into a game. Usually it's good matchmaking with good tight, and close games. The servers aren't amazing. I've gotten on a few times with the servers down for some reason but the issues seem to be fixed within 30 mins or so. So no real problem there. Now this game is based around the 360/ps3 version of PES 2017 and I have no clue why. Konami have been doing this for years with their yearly PES editions. It's the main reason why I do not own any PES game in my Steam libary. Give us the Xbox One/PS4 edition Konami please! Our PC's can handle it! Like just look at the system requirements, They are around 10 years out of date. Give us some improved graphics and shadows. Also can we have more options than low/med/high. I can run it on max settings @1080p/60fps sure but it would be nice to be able to turn off some options we do not want. Overall a fun game which I can see myself putting in several hours aslong as there are players to play against. I'm not quite sure why there are so many negative reviews of this game espically when it is a free to play game.			",170,27,10,14,12,4,12

												The main attraction here is exhibition mode and what you get for free is pretty good value. However, that mode is limited to like 9 teams .... It'll get old quick. Gameplay wise, It's not very fluid for a soccer game as PES has always been. Nonetheless, it'll sooth your soccer itch for free and you can try before you buy. Personally, this doesn't make me want to buy the full version.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played a couple of matches online and the lag is unbearable. Button inputs don't respond quickly which makes the game more difficult online. I only downloaded this version because of the PES League and I can't even enjoy it. KONAMI try and fix your servers so online gameplay can be smooth.

												i think the only reason konami realeased this trial edition is because they know the full game is♥♥♥♥♥♥and is not worth the 20$ it costs. i played the fifa 17 demo, and i have to say that it is waaaaaaay better than this. i expected much better, but it really seems out of fifa's league. it's weird you released it for PC, it's almost uncontrollable. you better get a console and pay for fifa 17, it's better and smoother in almost every way. the only good thing about this game is konami actually lets you play myclub and online, and even that is not much original or different than fifa's ultimate team. i wrote this review because i want to warn you about this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, and tell you that if you do like the PES series, then get this, but don't waste your twenty bucks on this dump.

Anyway it's free to play and I didn't invested any money so it's even, I guess.

												I haven't played much of this version, but there things to say even before playing it.I understand people who are angry at KONAMI, and I am one of them.On the other side, I will try to point moments that would be impossible if KONAMI did everything we want them to do.1. Licenses: Many people blame KONAMI for not getting licenses for leagues, clubs and national teams. It makes me upset, but doesn't make me angry, because it is not KONAMI who doesn't want to buy licenses, it is teams, leagues and countries who don't want to sell them. And you should probably be angry on certain league or team who has exclusive contract with FIFA. (Juventus and Real Madrid, for example didn't sell the license to KONAMI this year, because EA SPORTS got exclusive license from them.2. Graphics: PES 2017 is old-gen on PC, and this is very frustrating for people who have high-end PCs. I have a high-end PC and I am very upset about KONAMI not giving me the next-gen game. KONAMI is not evil here, because the reason behind going old-gen is because they want more people to be able to play it on PC, and it would be absolutely fine if they don't sell it for 30-40 gbp. This is the price of AAA next-gen game nowadays.3. Gameplay: PES 2017 is Football Simulator.4. PES 2017 TRIAL EDITION:  First of all, it is FREE. Secondly, you could see how KONAMI wanted to create a f2p game that lets people go competitive. It didn't work quite well last year, because MyClub cannot compete with FIFA Ultimate Team. They have decided to give people competitive gameplay system called Leagues, and I think it suits PES better than MyClub (UT clone) did. PES is simulator, and the main part of this game is GAMEPLAY. MyClub is competitive just the same way as MMORPG games are. Going F2P League mod, makes PES competitive in the way Dota 2 is. You download and lauch the game on your potato PC (because it doesn't even require high-end PC) and you are good to go and play with other people.5. SERVERS: all I can say, is servers are better than ever. I love that you can choose matchmaking lvls. (choose to play against opponent only with certain level of connection)6: COMPETITIVE FOOTBALL SIMULATOR: For me it is a huge step forward for KONAMI, making footbal competitive online, but many more things need to be done in future to polish this F2P edition.   *  I would love to see better match making system. It would be amazing if people could join the match, have some time to ban 2-3 teams, and then pick. *  I am not sure about this one, but I remember PES 2013 had online tournaments, you could enter during the day. It would be amazing to have it in this version.Finally, please ignore reviews like ""bad game, blablabla"". People who are reviewing this game here in Steam. At least try to list the problems of this game when you downvote it.Don't look at that ""Mostly Negative"" sign, and don't read bad reviews, if you want to play football simulator, competitively against other people ONLINE FOR FREE, go ahead and give this game a try. This is the unique game, and you will not get the same from any other game.			",49,2,2,7,4,1,2

												Been a while since I have played a PES game. Really seems alot slower than back in the glory days. I think They have focused to much on slowing it down. The feel of passing and shooting the ball is, as always, per-♥♥♥♥ing-fection, but sadly the heavy clunky player control lets it down. If they could scrap the whole ""it's slow and there for tactical"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and go back to fast responsive players even at the cost of ""realism"" with players turning with the ball quicker then PES could really offer a strong alternative.Shame they will always have to use false names though.COME ON YOU EAST DORSETSHIRE !!!!!!!!

												I'm new to the PES franchise (Have played FIFA my whole life) and I just have to say this game feels extrodinary to play, the physics and pacing are just wonderful. I've only taken the time to do the training drills and a handful of exhibition matches but I must say I'm really impressed, I'm definitely tempted to buy the full game now.			",183,27,6,21,13,3,15

Mini games are stright out pes 2016.I was going to get the game but saw this and thought its as good as for now. I have not been online yet.
