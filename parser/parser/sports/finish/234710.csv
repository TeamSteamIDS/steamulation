												I own this on both PS3 and PC and there's nothing much to say aside from that this is a brilliant Poker game with tasteful humour, solid dialogue and a great cast.Main Cast: Sam. (Sam & Max)Max. (Sam & Max)Brock Samson. (The Venture Bros.)Ash Williams. (Army of Darkness)Claptrap. (Borderlands)GLaDOS. (Portal)Reginald Van Winslow. (Tales of Monkey Island)Cameos:Steve the Bandit. (Borderlands)Mad Moxxi. (Borderlands)Doug. (The Walking Dead)Save-Lot Bandit. (The Walking Dead)Waiter. (Gravity Bone.)The Good:- Humour is great. - Voice acting is top notch.- Colourful cast of characters.- Well worth the price of £3.99.- Excellent replayability value.- Unlockable items in both Borderlands 2 and Team Fortress 2.The Bad:- Optimization isn't great. - Some annoying glitches. Such as; achievements not unlocking and items not unlocking properly.- Animation bugs.- Audio bugs.Final Verdict:8.8/10I hope you found this review helpful!			",38,7,0,0,1,2,2

												Pros:- Comedy has improved a lot- Gameplay is great- More and better choices of chips, decks, and tables- Great lineup of characters including GLaDOS, Brock Samson, and Sam- Pretty good unlockables for Borderlands 2 and TF2- Very fun and great for killing time (great replay ability)- OMAHA HOLD 'EM IS AN OPTION- The action has increased a bit- Great conversations- Some other pros I forgot aboutCons:- Claptrap's ADHD- Ash's constant bluffing- A tiny bit of bugs that rarely happen9/10. Not perfect, but I definitely recommend this to anyone who knows how to play poker.			",48,5,6,1,12,2,4

												Poker Night 2 is a Poker game made by Telltale Games. It is available for €5 and is worth a lot more than that. Poker Night 2 allows you to play Texas Hold'em and Omaha with Sam, Brock, Claptrap and Ash. And to hear the sarcastic lines of science fiction's deadliest A.I., GLaDOS.So what is this game all about? Well, you play as 'The Player' and you play Texas Hold'em with 4 pretty well-known game characters. While you are playing, you can complete quests to unlock Bounties. If you complete all four tasks, one of the characters will use an item to play. If you manage to beat that character you'll get a TF2 and Borderlands 2 item.Furthermore you'll earn chips that you can use to unlock special tables, decks and chips. The Inventory, the casino, will get a different appeance if you use a table, deck and chips of the same theme.I won't explain the rules of Omaha and Texas Hold'em, but i can tell you that this game is really awesome. While you're playing the characters will discuss about life, underwear and other kinds of useless crap. Call, Fold or Raise, and try to beat them all!Verdict--------This game offers a lot of fun for just €5. It has beautiful cinematic graphics, features 4 famous game characters and allows you to play poker without spending more than €5! Do I need to explain this any further? Just buy the freakin' game!This game will keep you in the Inventory for at least 25 hours. If you want to get all decks, cards, tables and unlockable items, you will be staying at the Inventory for 50 hours.Score: 81/100			",191,22,2,31,5,3,16

												I wholeheartedly recommend this game as a great way to relax after a long day of work/school.For the most part, the characters around the table are fun and have lots of personality.  If you know their history, its nice to see these licensed characters play poker the way one might imagine.  But even if you've never heard of most of them, you'll come to know them - and their interesting quirks - in short order.Sam is conservative with his betting, almost achingly so.  Ash is just as keen on bluffing as he is on raising the stakes - he *wants* the player to squirm.  Brock comes across as more studious with his bets, but won't hesitate to bet big when he feels he has the advantage; it is fun to just *watch* Brock think.  Claptrap is a wild card, and he knows it; he is fairly easy to intimidate and he seems eager to win the approval of his competitors.  His failures - and constant excuses - will make anyone familar with Borderlands want to hug him....and then hit him in the face.What makes the game particularly fun is that the characters seem to actually enjoy each other's company.  The lines are well read and the timing of their usage accurately reflects the events of the match.  GLaDOS is a perfect addition as supervisor for the evening's events - just as much as the other characters seem to like hanging out together, GLaDOS seems just as eager to be rid of them.  The dynamic works extremely well in keeping the match engaging.As for the poker itself, its pretty conventional stuff; no doubt you've played similar games with similar mechanics before.  But the matches move right along at a good pace, and the ""Showdowns"" are enjoyably tense.  These moments also have the funniest lines, in my opinion.  (...Brock...poor Brock...)In sum, Poker Night 2 is a presentation 'tour de force' with very competent game mechanics.  If you like card games, its not one to be missed.  Oh, and the price is great, too!			",418,75,8,48,32,8,39

												I really enjoyed these fantasy charactars talking about their adventures and making whole poker game feel more alive. Poker system is good, it's classic poker and you can play Texas Hold'em or Omaha style., but ifyou just want to play poker this game is not for you, it's frequently interrupted by chatting of other players and you can't do nothing but wait till they finish. So I recommend this game just in purpose to enjoy the scene and atmosphere. Stories and statements are quiet repetitive, but what would you expect, when you are playing 156th game of Poker, just to make your account balance not be in red numbers.Kinda funny and interesting.6/10			",320,92,7,54,60,4,68

												A virtual poker game from the Telltale studio, with four characters from different titles, mingled together for your pleasure. And it gives you some items for Team Fortress AND Borderlands 2! Other good thing is what it is a relatively fast full-complete game, where you can get some basic poker skills, if you wasn't familiar with all that poker stuff before.Surprisingly, it is a second game! So I can't be helped but to compare it with the first chapter. Though before I'll drown in the collation, I'll give you some general info.As a virtual poker player simulator, this particular game have many flaws. You have to listen an idle talk of some weird NPC characters, and the most of that talking is amusing at best, and, the worst, it gets repetitive quite fast. To succeed in the game, you need to complete some ""goals"", which can be easily seen as dumb moves. Like struggling for the showdown with only the kicker card, without any combinations... So, eventually, you'll make that goal, but how many times you'll fail miserably in the process? Only Fortune knows.In short, Poker Night 2 almost non-recommended for normal poker game. If only you're not absolutely green in it, so you need a simplistic stuff for getting started.Now, to comparison with the first game:Like Brock (one of the characters there) saying: I guess it's one of those ""take the good with bad"" things...1) Characters. They are much less attractive than in the first game. Less talks (less lines, and especially good lines for every character), less of this ""friendly"" atmosphere, which was created by the predecessor. While I'm usually a big fan of Ash Williams from Evil Dead franchise, I really have to say that it was his worst appearance in the video games (and I've seen them all). Other opponents are also of almost no fun. Brock and Sam have maybe two or three funny lines each, and even Claptrap isn't that shiny thing to save the day.Worst of all, while trying to make them all a better players, Telltale wiseguys do not give them personal characteristics, behavioral patterns, which was a catchy feature of the first game.2) While failed miserably with characters, Telltale has improved other aspects of the game, like: fixed stability issues, added more skins to background, and more little features like ability to order some drinks to your partners, to weaken them... There are much more various music now, visual part is a way updated from the first game.That's more, there you can play not only in the basic Texas Hold'em, but in the Omaha variant of poker as well. Which is good for your poker skill and flexibility of your mind.3) So far it sounds like ""less talk, more action"" stuff, which may be good, if you Just Want to Play a Poker... But alas! For some evil reason they cutted the ability to skip all those fuzzy repetative talks. So, when Claptrap is looping and freezing in the first time, it is fun, sure. But after you hear him 10-20 times, you obviously will be wanting to skip that *beep*. No such luck.I summarize:It is not very good poker game, besides the fact it is easy to adapt and there are an Omaha variant as a plus to the classic hold'em. Play it, if you are getting the items for Tea Fortress or Borderlands 2, or collecting acheievements on gold. But if you are looking for an atmospheric and fun poker game, I suggest to play the first Poker Night game instead. It is better.My mark is 6.2/10.			",725,237,45,155,101,5,232

												Rusty Venture used to sell faulty products to S-mart and apparently had a working relationship with Aperture founder Cave Johnson until his disappearance in the 1980s. That seemingly baffling sentence is a good test for gauging how likely you are to enjoy Poker Night 2. If you have no clue what I'm talking about, then it might be best to mosey on. However, if you recognize the references above and laugh at the very thought, then have a seat at the table.Like the original, your enjoyment of Poker Night 2 will depend greatly on how well acquainted you are with the different franchises showing up. The group is a little more eclectic this time around, pulling names from television and film as well as video games. You're now playing cards with Brock Samson, the kill-crazy bodyguard from Adult Swim's Venture Brothers, Claptrap the robot from Borderlands 2, Ash Williams, the cursed warrior from the Evil Dead film series, and Sam, Max's long-suffering talking dog detective partner. To top it off, GLaDOS from the Portal series has dropped in to act as dealer. There's at least as much dialogue as the first game had, and conceivably much more. Themed games (available once the player has unlocked a deck, chips, and table from the same franchise and activated them all at once) include exclusive conversations you wouldn't hear otherwise, and GLaDOS will often interrupt the players to ask if they could hurry up so she could get back to observing her tests. This is a far more volatile group than the original lineup. Brock has a temper that is always threatening to surface (especially when he loses a hand), while Claptrap and GLaDOS both make several remarks about killing humans. Ash seems rather calm, almost dazed, but he's just happy to be away from deadites for a couple hours. And Sam is the most level-headed of the group, even though Max is sitting in the booth behind him trying to throw him off his game.Poker Night 2 has loads of additional content, including a new game mode (Omaha Poker), unlockable decks, chips, and tables for each character that offer new dialogue and a complete redesign of the Inventory (the Sam and Max 25th anniversary set is my personal favorite), and 5 bounty items to collect, one from each player and GLaDOS. The unlocks are gained by spending Inventory tokens earned while playing, while the multitude of unlocks for both Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2 get handed out when the player wins another player's bounty item. Unlike the first game, bounty items are not put up randomly, but made available when certain challenges are met in-game. Another change to the bounty mechanic has the item won once the player simply wins the tournament, rather than having to knock out the character who put it up. Cameos and in-jokes abound, some of them pretty freaking obscure. It's a treasure hunt for detail lovers.As before, there is the chance of dialogue repeating. Unfortunately, Telltale did not include a skip option this time around, for no discernible reason. Another letdown is the fact that Ash sounds nothing like himself. Nothing against the actor who voiced him, but why not try harder to get Bruce Campbell? It would've really added to the experience, especially when all the other characters are faithfully recreated down to the original voiceover. Still, this is a dirt cheap title with a fun premise and solid execution, and I for one would like to see it continue. I've even had fun just speculating with other fans online about who should be included in the next installment. If you're a fan of any of the properties that Poker Night 2 has brought together, or if you just want to see what all the fuss is about, you won't regret the purchase. Telltale Games has added more unlocks, more characters, and more dialogue, all for the same price. It's hard to beat such a deal.			",147,93,0,13,7,2,7

Max is still there with even more craziness.+ Percentage of a win possibilities during all-in deal.+ Much more to-the-point achievements. It can take ages to get straight-flush in the Poker Night at The Inventory.+ (Debatable) Much more challenging partners.+ Game lags much less on slow PCs.+ The game process is more fast-paced.

IntroHey buddy whats up! Seems you got money on you grab a set and relax lets just play some nice friendly games with big watts of cash.What is really good about this game is not the poker itself. Which you can find anywhere on the internet anyhow. CharactersIt is the characters and the humor they bring to the table. The characters were pretty enjoyable to play against and that is its strongest selling point. Yes, if you play enough you will hear repeated dialogue but thats not an issue if you play in small session for the long term replay value say 30 minutes-1 hour a day.PrizesI found earning items and skins to change the style of the environment also a nice touch that adds some value to the overall game. Conclusion I would recommend this to anyone who just wants a quick break from their other games to enjoy hanging out with character personalities in a poker game.			",608,187,12,74,51,9,81

												The Good:* Great characters and voice work* Interesting mechanics outside of the card play* Decent if eventually predictable AI players* Great for casual playThe Bad:* Some conversations are long winded and repeat often* Occasional strong language, so rare it doesn't seem necessary* Grinding for cash becomes tedious as you learn the tells and AI* Collectables are mostly boring and entirely useless* Eventually runs out of steamBackground: Not a gambler but like the odd game of cardsImpressions: Good fun and often available at a budget price that makes it great value for a quick game of cards. Fun for a casual play when you have 5 minutes to spare but often find yourself staying for an hour.Recommended for: Light hearted cardplayers who like these whacky characters from their own franchisesConclusion: 7/10.

												Much like Poker Night at the Inventory (1), this game features a unique gathering of various game characters, who find themselves by a poker table. Poker Night 2 offers a brillaint variety of banter between the players, much like what was seen in the first game, and it ranges anywhere from humerous comments on the other player's history to snide remarks about their deeds - if you think you can enjoy a couple of random game characters getting together and cracking wise at eachother's expense, then this is definitely a game for you. Additionally, unlike the first game, the actual poker gameplay is spot on what you would expect. No weird hangups, no weird glitches where a pair of twos will beat a straight. Definitely recommended for something to do when you feel like playing something casually, or just feel like wasting a couple hours with some humor.			",1644,625,62,220,224,19,300

												The Poker Night franchise are really fun poker games, considering poker is not a solitary game you play ""by yourself"", and for the online poker players this is nice for a change. I enjoy some of the antics from the characters which make for a more genuine ""poker with friends"" experience. Also, there's a chance to win items for Team Fortress 2! This game is especially good for novice poker players to get acquainted with how the game is played, and also for the more experience players to just have fun with. 8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Poker Night 2 is the sequel to Poker Night at the Inventory. It continues bringing together many popular characters from different video games. This time Poker Night features Claptrap (Borderlands 2), Brock Samson (The Venture Bros.), Ash (The Evil Dead), Sam (Sam and Max series) and GLaDOS (Portal) as your dealer.In Poker Night 2 you have the option of playing either Texas hold 'em or Omaha hold 'em. In either case, tournaments start with a $20,000 buy-in.An humorous opening sequence leads you down into the Inventory and introduces the characters. These characters will have fun lines to say on their own, but the real treat is when two or more characters talk with each other.Each character also has a special item that you can win from them that unlocks items in Borderlands 2 and Team Fortress 2.Like in Poker Night at the Inventory the sequel has no multiplayer option, so you always play against the same opponents.The audio gags and discussions are amusing the first time you hear them, but they get annoying when you start hearing the same ones over and over again from one tournament to the next.All in all, if you are looking for a good poker game, then you should try Poker Night 2. The funny conversations and the items you can win make this a fantastic little game.Sounds 7/10Graphics 8/10Gameplay 7/10Atmosphere 8/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA ",1591,617,71,238,229,30,272

												Ahh, Poker Night 2. I must admit, I was pretty ecstatic about this before release. This sequel to the original Poker Night at the Inventory combines the personalities of CL4P-TP from the Borderlands series, Ash from the Evil Dead series of movies and video games, Sam from the Sam and Max series GLaDOS from the Portal series, and lastly, Brock (What?) From the Venture Bros. TV Series. (Oh, also, Mad Moxxi from Borderlands is the bartender but she never says anything so ignore her.)Well, I'll just make this short and quick for all of you, just DON'T. This game, in my honest opinion, is just not worth buying. This game is not only a poker game, but it is also meant to be a comedy that you can get a good laugh out of as Poker Night 1 was. In Poker Night 1, I considered the interactions of Tycho (Penny Arcade) and the Heavy (Team Fortress 2) to be truly hilarious. However, this game in particular falls flat as both a poker game and a comedy. Firstly, to me, anyway, most of the lines were simply unfunny. They were either stale jokes that were easy to see coming, or puns. Plus, as if the lines weren't enough to ruin the comedy, there simply aren't enough of them. I can't count how many times I've heard Sam say ""Sure is, exciting, isn't it?"" in a row every single time he placed a bet. As a poker game, I'd say it falls flat in that the bots are far too ridiculous. It seems like every single hand the bots get is simply one card better than yours. For example, I got a flush with both of the cards in my hand, I enter a 1v1 showdown with Brock, who then beats me with a 1 card higher kicker than mine. (In Poker-ese, that's incredibly hard and unlikely.) But, if this was a one-time experience, I could understand it, it's just poor luck. But this seemed to be the case EVERY SINGLE TIME I got a good hand, though it may just be me whining, there seems to be very little reward for being able to read the bot's faces. They seem random, if anything, which in a poker game, is truly ridiculous. I do not recommend this game,»ZCC« Zombie Chicken			",190,30,2,9,12,3,19

Short version: 90%Poker Night 2 is s step above the previous game in every way: more banter, better humour and opponent AI… it is simple more fun. It is probably the best poker game for this price, or even any price.Long version:Poker Night 2, just like its predecessor, tries to do what a few other poker games did by enhancing video poker with quality writing. Everyone you meet here is a known character from a known franchise (video games and motion picture alike), and they chat a lot. Their banter is not only full of humour, but somehow manages to feel natural, even when they talk about time travel or demons.The amount of spoken lines is impressive, and it can be boosted further by unlocking character-specific themes which all come with their unique bonus dialogues. This little addition can keep you in the game for quite a long time; it may take up to ten hours to unlock and hear everything.Good dialogues are great, but they couldn’t keep you around if the game is bad. Luckily TellTale managed to program a rather impressive AI for Poker Night 2; an AI that follows the characteristics of your opponents. They all have personalities and play accordingly… they sometimes even give small tells, if you look closely. Naturally they cannot substitute human players, but far as poker games go, Poker Night 2 is probably the best one you can get– and for a rather low price.			",78,260,0,12,9,2,21

												This game is a perfect example of ""a joke isn't funny twice"". You'll laugh the first time you hear the dialogue, but after the second, third, and fortieth time, you'll be rolling your eyes and pressing keys on your keyboard trying to find the skip button before you get reminded that there isn’t one.+Free BL2 and TF2 items (honestly the best point to play this game)+Funny mix of characters. In my opinion, a better cast than Poker Night 1. +Banter between characters is funny...the first time (explained below)-Dialogue gets very old, very quickly. This can be unbearable for some of the longer dialogue scenes. Oh, and did I mention they're UNSKIPPABLE?-The same thing above applies to ""tells"" in the game. ""Don't be scared by the chips. Don't be scared by the chips"". - Tells are less common than in Poker Night 1, and more ambiguous-A.I. feels very cheap, moreso than the first game. Even if you have a very good hand, they will most of the time beat you with unbelievable ""god hands"". This is one of my core complaints. Some people may say that I'm whining. It is definitely possible to do well against the A.I., and I've found the correct rhythm to regularly win against the computer. However, doing this requires you to be incredibly defensive. You must play much more conservative in Poker Night 2 in comparison to real life poker games because of the complete BS hands that the computer can get. Even when you have a very high hand, the computer will manage to tie with you. When combined with the gruelingly repetitive dialogue, this game can really feel like a chore for the items. There are hundreds of cheaper poker games out there that simulate the experience much better than this.			",136,17,0,10,6,2,6

Nice graphic and dialogue scriptsThe Bad:1. sometimes the lines get repetitive. 2. poker can be unexpectedly quite addictive, whether it's Texas Hold 'em or Omaha. Conclusion: 8/10 One of the fun poker games at your leisure that's worth giving a try. If you'd like a chill game with just you and yourself, this is one of the options ;)			",132,19,0,6,6,1,1

												Thanks to this game I now have a good idea as to how to play Poker.Initially I never knew how to play any type of poker but Poker Night 2 was just as good as a guide in playing it. Can't say I've mastered the game for sure since your enemies are basically AI and Poker mostly deals with more of bluffs and body language than luck. This game would have been a plus had it had an online multiplayer feature, but i guess this will do.What I enjoyed most about the game were the characters and in-game conversations. They are so funny, especially Glados. Just because of this game I feel like playing Portal 2 and watching the Sam and Max shows as well.Great game....you learn how to play it and have fun whiles playing it. 9/10			",150,20,1,15,3,1,10

												This game should have been amazing. Poker Night at the Inventory was fun, and Poker Night 2 theoretically improves on every aspect of that game; the decks, tables, and themes you can purchase in-game are of an even better class than ever before, and Telltale pits you against a whole slew of characters who not only live up to, but surpass those of the first installment. On paper, everything is jolly and lovely. But when you first start up the game, you realize something is wrong...horribly wrong. The effort this game forces you to put in to earn its touted TF2 items is a far cry from the laid back nature of Poker Night 1's system. By the time you've earned the fifth, and arguably best, item the game has to offer, you've trudged through 15 disgusting challenges the game concocts for the sole purpose of extending the longevity of the game, all at the expense of the player's mental health. Any joy you may have derived from listening to the delightfully witty banter of characters such as Claptrap or Brock Samson will quickly turn in to teeth-gnashing fury as you feebly try to find a way to skip past all the fluff just to fail the tournament at a critical moment, with the bounties right out of your reach. What's worse, the items you can earn are intrinsically linked to the Steam achievements for the game, which means that, for the unlucky few out there (yours truly included), playing in offline mode prevents you from reaping your hard earned rewards. The proposed solution to this issue? ""Like we give a ♥♥♥♥, we already got your money, fool. Delete your save and try again"" - Telltale Games and Valve Support. ""P.S. You're our ♥♥♥♥♥ now, LOL""In short, this game can only have concievably been concocted in the deepest wretches of Hell, created through an unholy union between Satan, Cthulhu, and Duma Key, and fashioned from the filthy excrement of a million aborted fetuses. Do yourself a favor and pretend the Poker Night series never made it past the first installment. Even the greatest of masochists would pale at the thought of playing this   inhumane creation.Also, Sam is a ♥♥♥♥♥.			",366,82,7,47,31,2,41

												So, about a year ago (at the time of writing, anyway) I was up at about 1am on New Year's Day, cider in my glass and I was playing Poker Night at the Inventory 1. It's a quirky game, with colourful visuals, great characters, great dialogue and some neat rewards. Oh, and there's poker. I had never played Texas Hold'em before (to this day, I think it's the only proper card game I've ever played) and after looking up the rules and having the tutorial fill in the blanks, I had a good idea of what to do. So much so, that I bought the sequel to play more and, more importantly, get more items for Team Fortress 2. I'll say it now; Poker Night 2 is definitely better than the first PN. If you haven't played the first one, I'd recommend it, mainly if you play TF2 like me. Now, that's enough backstory. On to the good stuff. (This review might be a bit on the long side).So, once again, you're back at the Inventory, playing poker against 4 colourful characters from various entertainment. The first PN had Strong Bad (Strong Bad), Max (Sam & Max), the Heavy (Team Fortress 2) and Tycho (Penny Arcade). Now, we have Brock Samson (The Venture Bros.), Claptrap (Borderlands 2), Ash Williams (Army of Darkness) and Sam (Sam & Max). In my opinion, this is a much better cast. It certainly feels more balanced as opposed to the craziness of the first game. Oh, and did I mention that GLaDOS is the poker table and commentator? I won't explain the rules of poker (the game has another tutorial for that anyway) but I'll list off the features. In PN 1, you would play poker, win different decks and tables and stumble upon a chance to win a TF2 item by beating the retrospective character yourself. This chance was entirely random, so if you only wanted the item (let's face it, that's what we all came for) you would have to keep hitting the 'restart' option and hoping that someone would put their item on the table. When you take into consideration the fact that characters would occasionally fold frequently (I'm looking at YOU, Tycho), this would make the matches rather tedious, as you have to keep trying to make characters bet whilst not making poor decisions and giving them more money (making it even more long and tedious). Thankfully, this system has changed. Now, you complete challenges to have a player place a bounty on the table. Win the tournament and an item for Borderlands 2 and TF2 is yours. Lose the tournament? The item will be back on the table by the next match, no resetting needed. Also, there are new tables, decks, chips and the introduction of themes. Apply all the items in a set and the Inventory gets a BIG visual overhaul, changing the lighting, the background and giving the retrospective character a slight outfit change. There are also special cutscenes and dialogue that occur with these themes, both of which are quite entertaining. Seriously, the cutscenes with Steve in the Borderlands 2 set are some of the funniest moments in this game. More features include a second mode of 'Omaha' poker (again, there's a tutorial) and being able to buy drinks for the other characters, making them reveal 'tells' more often (basically, hints about the strength of their deck Yes, I said DECK). There's also a cheatsheet that covers all the possible hands but if you've learned poker then you'll probably know these.Finally, the dialogue is worth mentioning too, it's that good. It ranges from references, to asking others about their universes and some great humour (particularly with Claptrap). It stops the gameplay from seeming too stale and makes it more entertaining, even if you hear certain lines multiple times (I'M LOOKING AT YOU GLADOS). Now, the game isn't perfect. Some challenges may take time to beat and despite this, the replay value isn't that large. But, for what it is, Poker Night 2 is a solid sequel and a great poker game. If you own TF2/Borderlands 2, played the first PN, or both, pick it up for some good entertainment. 8.5/10			",40,6,0,1,0,2,1

												It is just as someone else already pointed out. The game is clearly biased towards the AI, regularly providing them with very strong hands and even dealing cards that have already been played. It seems as if the developers wanted to stretch the game to make sure that players listen to all of the dialoge between the AI characters (which is obviously the actual point of the game). In order to achieve that, they mess with hands probabilities big time, let alone basic logic.As long as you don't care about the actual poker game going on and just want to hear some funny conversations, you will likely enjoy this game for a few hours. However, if you're looking for a competent poker game and assumed Poker Night 2 would deliver that while also offering a fun setting, you'd better give this one a pass.			",69,13,8,2,2,2,4

												This game is pretty much what it sells itself as, nothing more or less.  It's a Texas Hold 'Em tournament featuring fictional characters from somewhat recent games, and two cultural characters known from outside gaming.  LucasArts and Telltale veterans Sam and Max, and the damaged robots Claptrap and GLaDOS represent gaming, while Ash from The Evil Dead and Brock from The Venture Bros. round out the group.  Moxxie is the bartender, but you never interact with her.You play as yourself, never seen, against Brock, Claptrap, Ash, and Sam, while GLaDOS hosts and Max messes around off to the side.  The game then pretty much consists of playing Texas Hold 'Em while the characters chat and wisecrack at each other during the game.  While that's pretty much all there is to it, they do say some really funny things.  As you play, you can unlock special items for Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2 by winning hands and completing challenges.  You also earn tokens you can use to buy drinks and themed items like cards, chips, and tables based on the franchises featured.  For me, this is one of the games I play just to wind down, and when I can't sleep.  It's not too involved, it's not risky or complicated, it's just poker.  With video games characters and jokes.  I just wish it wasn't Hold 'Em.			",173,41,6,32,22,4,50

												Poker Night 2 is one of those sequels which is mechanically comparable to the preceding title, but more charming and polished. The first game delivered a poker experience with four pop media figures, the second gives you the same, with different figures. The new selection is both more interesting, and better presented, as befits a sequel.The player, voiceless, is ruthlessly teased by their opponents. Brock Samson plays with an appropriate sort of serious absurdity, the most grounded competitor. Claptrap is as annoying as he is in his birth title, and you'll enjoy when he leaves the table. Ashley Williams is so aggressive, you may let Sam handle him. Sam is the cautious, ruthless player who almost always plays his cards.All in all, if you want a more challenging poker experience with better - more varied - dialogue and interaction between the characters, buy Poker Night 2, and have a night to remember. And then another. And another.			",389,91,2,44,21,2,52

												Ah Poker Night 2. A poker sim with 5 players total. 4 From Different franchised games plus you the mute. This is a fun little poker game with very unique dialogues featuring Brock Samson from Venture Bros, Claptrap from borderlands2, Ash WIlliams from Army of Darkness, Also Sam and max tag team this time around. GLADOS is the overseer of your hectic underground illegal poker game mocking you at any chance she gets. Some scenes will make you LOL. The core game is fun and quirky but is missing a lot of features to make this a complete poker game. You are forced to do 5 players  no more no less. There is no online or multiplayer at all. There are a few sets of unlockable decks, chips, and themes  based on each character to add some replayability and try to experience all the dialogue. CPU strategy can be messed around buying them drinks from the bar so they are not always predictable. In the end Poker Night 2 does leave you wanting so much more and proves poker games have a  place on steam. You can't beat its asking price of 5$ 1$ if on a sale. So I deff recommend it even if you don't know poker or only like 1 of the characters.Final Score 7.5/10			",322,54,9,40,30,5,36

												My gambling adventure continues on this game..... I remember the days of playing with The Heavy, Strong Bad, Tycho, and Max at The Inventory..... Ahhhhh good guys to play poker with...... (OH WAIT Max is back.... for the conversations xD)Anyway Poker Night 2 is just like the first game except there's new poker players [Brock, Claptrap, Ash, and Sam], (Sam is my most favorite character to play poker with), a new dealer (GLaDOs), trophies, and new poker environment settings based off of the poker players.... Anyway this game is lots of fun and it's a pretty good game to practice before gambling in the real world....... XD Anywho I definitely recommend this game if you're into playing poker.""Poker ain't a game for cowards!"" - Ash Williams			",555,145,3,26,16,4,3

												This is how the game works: You get a hand that is hardly ever beaten. The NPC's cards are most likely crap compared to it, at least if you have played some poker you know it's not very likely everybody has better cards than you every single game.Now depending on your playstyle their cards are adjusted by the game to punish you for being too sure of your hand.If you play ""reasonably"", you might get away with your hand and beat all of the others.Doesn't matter how good your hand is or if your winning chance is 99% after you decided to go All In with it, during the next move the game will place cards that definitely beat yours in your opponent's hands. Your winning chance switches from 99% to 1%. This happens on a regular basis. The game just counters your hand and whatever you have, you WILL be punished.Sometimes every NPC has ridiculously good cards to make sure your good cards are countered, which means every single one of them has a Flush, a Full House and so on. But this only happens when you dare to go All In too quickly.If one of the NPCs goes All In though with a 2 and a 7 (yes, this happened) before even the flop is revealed, they win the game with it. So - not fun at all. The lines of every character are terribly annoying and you can't skip them or keep playing during them. It is like watching the same 3 cutscenes again after every move, and some of them are very long. I would play PN1 again, but this game? No way. Just grabbed all the TF2 items and deinstalled forever.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Product received for free
												Poker Night 2 is a card game that you are in a league with famous characters from games, namely: Claptrap (Borderlands 2), Brock Samson (The Venture Bros.), Ash (Army of Darkness) and Sam (Sam and Max series). Which is developed and distributed by Telltale Games with release date April 23, 2013.This game is a continuation of Poker Night at the Inventory game, which has the same premise tournament, however the characters involved are others.In gameplay is simple and easy to perform any function, even the biggest problem is to learn the rules of the game, despite having a short tutorial that is very functional.The goal of the game itself is very simple, have the best combination of cards and win the opponents to only have you at the table, that is, the new champion. There is also the missions which completing a number unlocks the chance to win a special item, can say a sort of trophy, and each character has a unique item, these trophies not only count as an advance in the game, but also release exclusive items for players of Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2.In addition to the trophies the game also features unlockable visuals that are purchased with tokens which are earned when making point in the tournament (between 10 and 50 chips) and winning (100 chips).Three modifiable items: chips, the table and the cards.Joining 3 items of a theme change the scenario as a whole and makes the character belonging to use a ""custom"" different.The game despite being a genre where the seriousness tends to be better, ultimately happens several dialogues and comedic interactions, which increase to the character of the scenery. (The other characters also interact with different scenarios). Among the players there are secondary characters as GLaDOS (Portal 1 & 2), Max (Sam and Max series), Steve and Moxxi's (Borderlands 2). Although the only character portal be a sort of secondary, there is also a trophy and setting the same.Things that caught my attention in particular:- Customizable for the game, which give a totally new and more attractive face.- Items and trophies that serve to encourage the player to get 100%.- Several scenes and dialogues that change during gameplay.- I found particularly good addicting game.I picked up this game without any pretense me hold or even being afraid of not being able to go away for never having played Hold'Em or any other for the tournament. I admit that every match was surprised with the amount of dialogues and small scenes, like when I found out everything I told here. After +/- 10 hours, I even I am a little better and I have a fair amount of victories.The matches have about 20 minutes each, but depending on your walk, you can have 10 minutes where you give all in and lose everything, even when the cards are not good you jump several times which may lead to 30 -40 minutes on average.There were few times which I came across an error in the game and despite everything that happened not really detracted from the gameplay: character cross in front of the camera and vr inside and some dialogue hang for about 1 or 2 seconds, however were really times were rare. I think for sure the game is worth it, because I believe so much who is playing the characters, humor them or even learn about a new sport. Will get yes please everyone.For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/ .Also you're welcome to join in the fun in our Steamified group.

												On sale for less than $2, this game could be dog♥♥♥♥♥♥in a bag and it might still get a positive recommendation... As it turns out, this is actually a brilliant way to spice up a game of virtual Poker.  Great characters, plenty of well done voice acting, interesting unlockables, and good atmosphere (revealing that last card can be very suitably tense).Some of the jokes get old after you hear them over and over, especially the long ones though.Shame it never got DLC to expand the cast of AI players, I wouldn't mind rotating players in and out every now and then.

												If you enjoyed playing Poker Night at the Inventory, then your going to love it's sequel. Taking place at the same old Inventory, only this time it's a game of Texas Hold Em or Omaha against Brock Samson from Venture Bros, Claptrap from Borderlands 2, Ash Williams from Evil Dead, and Sam from Sam and Max, while the mechanical GLaDOS from Portal acts as the dealer in this game. The gameplay is more challenging this time with more money then the last game, and every so often the players will either try to raise the blinds or go all in, it's a real gamble to see if your going to win or not. The game introduces the Inventory Tokens that act as your currency to buy beer for the players or to purchase Table Felts, Cards, and Chips, as their are 5 Table Sets. Buying drinks will sometimes help the player see their tells while unlocking the Table Sets from a specific theme will give the Inventory a new look, as well as some special dialogue for the characters along with some entertaining eliminations to the players. The exclusive items are back for both TF2 and Borderlands 2, by completing specific tasks, someone will place a Bounty Item on the table in which you have to win the tournament instead of knocking them out to win the item. I recommend playing Omaha to win the Bounty Items as you'll have a better chance in getting a good hand most of the time. Just like it's predecessor, the dialogue is wonderful to listen to, it's not that often you see 3 video game characters, a TV show character and a Film character having a nice friendly and comical chat together. I only had a few issues with this game, mainly the missions you need to complete to unlock a bounty challenge, some of them are simple while others rely on luck to complete them, and that tends to be annoying. And once again, no Online play. But other then that, Poker Night 2 is an epic game and since it's only $5.00 like it's predecessor, it's worth it. Especially when you can unlock Sam's hat in TF2 which is awesome!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love poker and I'm a big fan of Borderlands and Telltale, what could go wrong? A lot actually.....This game is really frustrating and has nothing to do with poker, the players have no range at all and you don't have any fold equity. One exemple: 3 players with the same stack, 2 of them go all in on a A J 9 flop, the third one then call with 3 6 offsuit (no flush draw possible, no odds whatsoever). No one would ever do that, and it actually happens every two hands on that game. At no point I felt like playing poker or had any pleasure sitting at the table. The characters are not funny, especially when they only have 5 different lines each. So you'll hear them making the same comments again and again.....and again. The pace of the game is very slow, every time someone talk, the game is paused even if the people talking are not in the hand.If you like poker, don't play that game. If you don't know poker and would like to have a taste of it, for the love of god don't play that game and seek any other poker games out there. The only point of playing it would be if you really want the downloadable contents for Borderlands 2 or TF22/10 (1 point for the downloadable contents and 1 point because Claptrap), would fold again			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Poker Night 2 is a great improvement on Poker Night 1, offering new opponents, 10 exclusive items (5 for TF2 and 5 for Borderlands 2), items that change the theme of the whole Inventory, the Omaha game mode (I prefer Hold 'Em as a great Hold 'Em hand often becomes a terrible Omaha hand) and GLaDOS AS THE DEALER. The dialogue and animation are even better than the original, and the AI seems to be scarier - rounds rarely end without at least one opponent going all in. A few negatives: quite a lot of typos in the subtitles; Brock's dialogue is a bit quiet sometimes; no options to reduce the amount of chatter; didn't seem to work well with a controller.

												This game will frustrate you.This game will seem rigged.This game will put you in imaginary debt.10/10 would lose $100,000 in half an hour again.Review Revision #1:Before reading this edit, bear in mind I play (almost exlusively) the Omaha game mode, which is identical to Texas Hold'Em except you get dealt 4x cards instead of two and you pick two from your hand to make the 5.There are many things wich annoy me about this game. For example:-- There's plenty of dialog in this game that not only gets repetative and annoying, but also is unskippable. This is simply frustrating.-- I don't play a lot of poker outside of this game, nor do I know the probabilities associated with different hands, but the hands will go on seemlingly long streaks of good or bad cards on the same players over serveral hands. What I mean is: you might have bad cards for up to ten or so hands while one or two of the AI have great cards for the hands. Whether or not this is typical of poker, this does get infuriating.-- The AI bet without logic a lot of time. I've seen the AI go all in to $10k - $20k+ on an Ace High hand after the River (5th) card has been delt. Nobody in their right mind goes all in on that much money with only a high card. There are so many other betting discrepancies that it's not funny.-- Going on the above point, the amount of betting that occurs before the first three cards are delt is rediculous. With a $20k buy in on you + 4x AI players, I've seen the pot hit $30k+ before the first three cards are delt. There is no hand worth a pot that much without seeing those first cards.-- The AI don't change their play styles and if you're paying attention even a quarter of the time, it's very predictable who you'll be facing off againt at any given point. For example, I've elimintate 3 out of the 4 AI players many times, but never have I ever not eliminated Ash.-- Another example is early game, Sam folds a lot. I'm not kidding. I've seen a player been busted out and somebody's up $20k+ before he ever makes any bet what-so-ever (apart from the blinds).-- There are too few unlockables and you earn way too many tokens. It is so easy to earn the tockens required to unlock all the skins for the decks, table and room, so you're left with all these excess tokens. The only thing other than those unlocks that you can spend the tockens on is drinks for the other AI players. This is not only fruitless half the time, but also doesn't seem to stem the tide of tockens you earn.-- This is perhaps my biggest complaint: There is not Multiplayer! No multiplayer mode, no online server (dedicated or otherwise), no LAN, no nothing! This means that not only can you not play with your friends, but the game itself gets extremely repetative after while because there's not enough variety in the AI and, as mentioned before, there's problems with the hands delt and the AI betting.As you might be able to tell from my above list, there is so much about this game that annoys me. That being said, I kinda like and kinda dislike how easy it is to grind out all the achievements. Also, it does seem to be a half-decent time filler or TV companion. For example, if you're watching a movie or TV (especially if you're watching it on a second computer monitor), it's a fun enough game to play while watching.Overall, it's not a particullary great game and is definitely lacking (especially in the multiplayer department), but if you can pick it up cheap, then it's definitely worth it. Giving it a 6.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

So that's kinda neat. Also there are items for Borderlands 2, but I don't care about that.So... if you want some items for those two games, then I guess pick this up. It's kinda fun to play for a little bit anyway. It's much better than the first game was, so this gets a solid ""yes"" from me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all, if you do not like poker, I don't think you will like this game. Don't get me wrong, the poker part of this game is only like 10% of the game.So, if this is a poker game, but the actual poker playing in it is only 10% of this game, what makes this game worth while? One thing: Excellent screenwriters! In this game you play poker against four persons, Claptrap from Borderlands, Sam from Sam & Max, Brock Samson from The Venture Bros and Ashley 'Ash' J. Williams from Evil Dead. These guys have the most amazing and hilarious things to say, and I can honestly say I'm not sure I've heard it all even though I played a lot of hours! The screenwriters in this game have tied together these characters in a way that many other games can't do, and since these are all loveble characters from already known media, you will probably already know them and recognize some things they talk about. The thing that keeps one playing this game is first of all the conversations, but secondly the achievements. when you play against these guys you unlock different boards and enviroment of the room you play in, you also win different ""famous"" items from these guys, so there are quite a few things to do. But yeah, I really recommend this game AS LONG as you enjoy poker.Oh, and did I mention Glados is the one who's the dealer? Great fun!And you get stuff to Borderlands 2 by playing this! It's a win win situation!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off, let me start with this: This is a great game if you enjoy poker or the personalities of the characters involved, BUT Don't pay full price for it. There simply isn't that much content to justify even a $5 price tag. You only get two poker modes, Texas and Omaha, and the dialogue becomes very repetitive after awhile. You CAN unlock some new dialogue options by winning consistently and buying full sets of unlockables (card decks, chips, and table covers for each character) but the dialogues are still random so the new stuff may take awhile to pop up. The game regularly goes on sale as much as 80% off, which is a very fair price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Poker Night 2 is a game you want to play if you feel like playing some cards and relaxing a bit. The comments of the NPC's become a bit repetative at times but they are funny and that goes a long way. The action itself is a bit slow paced, mainly because the game takes some time to present you with the NPC's dialogues in between hands. You can however skip to the next hand if it is your turn. The NPC's poker AI isn't all that bad, they can surprise you with some bold and unexpected moves but after a few hours of play you will start to see a pattern. They will occasionally break the pattern though, which makes it exciting. You can collect throphy's and themes for the poker room which is pretty straight forward but fun nonetheless.If you judge this game for what it is (a cool way to play cards and have a laugh) and not for what it isn't (a poker tournament simulator) then you will have a lot of fun playing it.I would give it 7.5 out of 10.

												After playing this game for a couple of games, I think I've finally grasped how the card game 'Poker' works.Every turn, you randomly click buttons on the table, hoping that the dealer tells you that you've succeeded. If you succeed, you are given an ancient and powerful artifact, capable of destroying or enslaving the human race entirely. I have used this to great effect by traveling back in time and enslaving most of an entire race, before I was almost assassinated in my sleep and forced to come back to this era to write this review.Overall I give this game about a 6.8 out of 10, due to the amount of vomiting that has occurred due to rituals involving bear urine and anthrax. I heavily suggest this game to anybody looking to learn how to play Poker.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I feel the harder difficulty made it better because it felt like a game where you really had to spend some time on it to master and unlock things. They also did much better on the AI and the jokes are as great as ever. If you felt poker night 1 was to short you will enjoy this one more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Poker Night 2 is not your typical type of poker game. It's not about ploughing through those hands per hour and getting as much action in as you can. It's all about attempting to create an atmosphere akin to a game with friends. The most important thing in the game for me, is the characters and how they interact with each other and the player. The game has a lot of dialouge, and there's a few conversations between a couple of the characters, which is a nice change from the odd quip here and there.The addition of a GlaDOS as the dealer is great, I could listen to her speak all day I think. I also like that Moxxi's manning the bar, I was disappointed she didn't even have a word to say though.Overall the characters have a good amount of lines, but not enough. I was getting repeats of the conversations within an hour of playing. I'm sure there's stuff I haven't heard yet, but I can tell that there's not enough dialouge. On the other hand. The game is priced at £3.99. I can't expect the voice acting that we've come to expect in our games.I would've really liked to have seen more characters. Even another two characters would make things more exciting. I don't mind playing short-handed (there's only ever a maximum of 5 players at the table), and having two characters able to rotate in with the rest would make each game feel a little different.The AI has been vastly improved since the preceeding game. The NPCs all seem to have a distinctive style of play, which once figured out makes things a little easier. The tell system is often a complete giveaway. An observant player should never lose a tournament.One thing that hasn't improved from the last game is the horrible UI. It's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥to find the right raise sometimes. I'd love to be able to type in a number, or have incriments of chips I can drag to the table. It does the job, but it could be better. The bounty system is quite fun, being presented with challenges to complete keeps things interesting. I'm enjoying unlocking the chip-sets, decks and felts as I accumulate more tokens based on my performance on each table. One of my favourite features in the game is that if you activate the deck, chip-set and felt from the same set the UI changes to be stylised to match. There's also a couple of other changes, but I wont spoil them for you!Something else that I like is that if you're unfortunate enough to be knocked out you can watch the rest of the game play out. The game will even show you the NPCs cards.Overall, every damning point about the game can be easily defended by it's wonderfully low price. Personally, I would love to have seen a bigger game, even if it was sold at 3-4 times the price. I think they could have increased the price point to $10 and added some more content without losing a considerable amount of sales, but I guess that's not the type of game this is.Bottom line: Casual poker fun with great characters at a great price.

”Hail to the King, baby.” -Ashley WilliamsWith the myriad of video games that have been introduced throughout the years depicting intense scenes of hardship, degradation, and redemption, I am certain there are some characters that would prefer to just take it easy and play some table games every now and then. Poker Night 2 (PN2), the sequel to the ever-popular Poker Night At The Inventory, was published by in 2013 by Telltale Games, and allows the player to ante-in to a one-game poker tournament with individuals the likes of Brock Samson from the Venture Bros.  television show, Claptrap from the Borderlands series, Sam from the classic Sam and Max detective adventures, and-my personal favorite-Ashley Williams from the  Evil Dead/Army of Darkness trilogy. Poker Night 2 is exactly as you expect it to: as a card game computer simulator; there’s really no explanation needed for this. However, this title offers much more than just a deck of cards and green felt.Here are a few reasons to consider Poker Night 2:Gameplay - This title is not so much a continuation of the last episode as it is a familiar experience with a different set of familiar faces. The player is re-invited to the Gallery, the venue for the first game’s setting, to partake in more tournaments with an increase buy-in amount. The player may challenge said opponents to two variations of poker, being Hold’Em and Omaha. There is nothing truly outstanding about the game’s mechanics other than being able to purchase drinks for other competitors to throw them off of their game, though it does have a unique facial-reading system in which the player may gauge the others’ dealt hands by viewing simple responses to them. PN2 primarily utilizes a mouse interface to select options in menus and during tournaments; this is as simple as it can get. Why I added this section, however, is to touch a bit on the other competitors’ ruthless cunning during tournaments. I am usually pretty decent at poker and other card games, but this character cast knocks me down a peg both competitively and morally at times by taking outstanding risks to oust everyone else from the game.Humorous Cast - Along with the stated characters, Mad Moxxi from the Borderlands tends the bar, Portal’s GLaDOS is the card dealer, Tales from Monkey Island’s Reginald Van Winslow reprises his role as the Inventory’s host, and Max-Sam’s faithful partner and competitor in the first Poker Night-sits idly by, awaiting moments to add to the comedic dialogue exchanges; a random bandit from Borderlands named Steve also makes appearances from time to time, but mostly remains hidden from the scenes. Each individual around the table converses with one-another fluidly, and intriguing conversations arise both about the game at hand and of everyday lives, such as Brock Samson’s mentioning of his employers or Sam and Max respectively spouting back and forth. These witty exchanges remove much of the tension from each session so that the tournament simply feels like a friendly game among friends.Unlockables - Poker Night 2, similar to the original, features content that may be revealed through play. After each session, whether the player won or lost, tokens are earned that may go toward purchasing various themed table felts, chips, cards, or alcoholic beverages during games-which simplify the ‘tells’ from the opposition. Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2 also benefit from Poker Night 2, as players may equip items such as Sam’s signature hat in TF2 and Brock Samson’s haircut for the Gunzerker in Borderlands 2, respectively; these unique articles are rewarded for obtaining Bounties, challenge items unique to each character’s respective games.TL:DR - Though not complex, this title can be extremely cut-throat in nature, especially when there are few remaining players. Conversation is intriguing given it is between various characters that will very likely never meet again, and livens up the play experience with quirky yet witty lines. I highly recommend this title to anyone who enjoys playing table games with brutal adversaries. Thanks for reading.Do you enjoy these reviews? Please visit my Curator Page at  Spearpoint Reviews.

												Even though I did not play any other game which the characters are in (I own Borderland but haven't got the will to play it), I still really enjoy the game. I love to listen the conversation, maybe because I'm still only barely 2 hours into the game so everything is new to me, I don't know when will the conversation be repeating. But so far so good.

												This is by far the best video poker game I've ever played, it easily teaches how to play poker as you play, the AI is the most challenging and most complex yet, and you feel like you are actually there in the scenario, playing poker with real people, only the people you play against are iconic pop culture characters.The characters have an endless amount of dialouges, but once you play about 20 matches they say the same thing every time, another problem i have with this game is that you don't get to be a certain character, you're always known as ""that guy who's mute"" you don't really get to establish a friendship with the characters like in other TTG games (then again, this game mocks you for being a nerd playing virtual poker).This game is certainly great, it's a shame it's overshadowed by it's partnership with Team Fortress 2 items, it is honestly a great game to play besides getting those TF2 items.If you love poker, this is a must have, far more better than Poker Night 1.TL;DR Very complex and puzzling AI, easy to adapt inside the game and just fun poker time, dialouge gets overused when it runs out and you don't get to have a character as a protagonist for a game that immerses you in a virtual reality.Just buy it.

												This game is good.  Not great mind you, but good.  Anyone who has spent a significant time playing poker in the real world and then attempted to play it in video games would tell you that most poker video games are crap.  This makes sense, as trying to replicate the human mind as it plays poker would prove difficult.  Consequently, most poker AI is overly simplistic and not true to life.  This game is no different in that sense, but thankfully it's still an improvement from the previous installment.  The AI is a little off at times, but for the most part the computer players play a solid game and aren't prone to the ridiculous aggression found in the previous installment.  That being said, the betting is still off as it's quite common for a computer player to open a pot with a bet that's 10x the current pot.  If you have a good hand and are trying to get action that makes no sense, and if you have a marginal hand and are bluffing then why not go all in?  It's a confusing play that happens often.  Thankfully, the characters and banter are a huge improvement over the previous game (which was already quite good in that department).  The number of comments from characters and the various unique interactions between them makes this game less repetitive than the previous one.  Overall this game is a good one, but I still long for the day when we're able to better program poker AI.  This is likely the best poker game on Steam at the moment, but it's a 7/10 as far as I'm concerned.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 A Poker Game With Unusual Friends.What To Expect From This Game?This game is about gambling $20,000.00 against some irregular players in a game of poker. Your opponents will frown, laugh, chat, bluff and make threats in order to win the tournament. There are two modes of Poker to play for each tournament that will offer new challenges and achievements to complete. When the player successfully completes a tournament, money will be won, tokens to be gained and a possible prized trophy to be received. The player will laugh or cry and possibly kiss his/her money goodbye.What Are The Pros Of This Game?  Movie/Cartoon/Game Characters (Original Voice Actors)  Good Game Controls  Good Graphics  Fun & Entertaining Conversations  Alternate Setting Changes  Alternate Elimination SequencesWhat Are The Cons Of This Game?  Limited Players (No Variety Of Characters To Play Against)  No Conversation Interaction With Players  Repetitive Conversations  Opponents Have Higher Luck Advantages  Empty Threats  No Fighting (Who Wouldn't Enjoy Seeing Brock VS Ash)Would You Recommend This Game?Yes, I recommend this game for the fans of the characters in this game. It is interesting to see such characters interact with one another, but it is a shame the player (he or she) cannot engage in conversation or interact with them too. Puchasing drinks for other players is the only interaction with the characters in this game. I know this game is purposely released as a ""Poker"" game, but the developers could of enable more options for the player to interact by asking or answering questions or get into a brawl. However, the game does very well of being a simple card game simulator. My other complaint is there should of been more opponents to play against other than Ash, Brock, Claptrap and Sam. **Game Tip: Expect to ""Fold"" a lot in this game due to bad hand dealt to player percentages.Fold, Bet, Raise or All-In For A Game Of Poker !!!

												It's poker with all new characters and unlockables, what more do you want ? Well, for starters, I wish I knew how to play poker. Properly.The characters and environments are pretty sweet looking and the voice acting is superb. But since it's a poker game you'll probably have heard all the lines after only one hour has passed. And let me tell you, there are a lot of conversations. At times I just wanted everyone to shut up so I could play in peace.But, for a price this low I can only recommend it, especially if you know how to play cards (and enjoy it at the same time). If you loved the first one there's no doubt you'll love the second one as well.[Rating: 77/100]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay look, I havent even ""technically' finished the game yet, but I really do need to talk about this before I end up punching a hole through my computer.I bought Poker Night 1 for the items, and really ended up enjoying the game, so I decided to get the second one for even more fun. Poker Night 2 does have better characters (imo) but doesnt utilize them correctly. There isnt enough good conversations. Sure there are few, but those will pop up very rarely. Now lets talk about the ""Play to Win!' mechanic. The way to win items is so ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ its not even funny. First you have to complete three objectives, and then you have to win an entire tournament for one (or two depending on if you have b2 and tf2) item. Doesnt seem hard, but it really is. Why couldnt they just stick to the first games mechanic of ""Knock the player out and recieve there buy-in!"" Last is the AI... Everythings ♥♥♥♥ing rigged. im just gonna say it. I have spent rounds and rounds getting cheap cards while everyone else is somehow pullings kings and aces out there asses. I will finish the game for the items, but thats it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												poker is really fun i mean here are the rules: one guy puts down a card and then the other guy puts down a card and then if that card is the same as the card before you yell ""POKER!"" and you win the hand. it's really great fun and because i don't have any friends i decided to buy this game for 70p so i could play it on my virtual computer game system. characters from video games are in this one as well so the robot from borderlands is here as well as the robot from portal and some other guys as well and you can win items for the games that they feature in. the problem here is that you can't skip the dialogue which isn't funny or well written and is just real boring crap and there's no visible ""quick play mode"". i mean everybody plays this game for the in game items obviously so why isn't there just a quick play mode. stupid. i wish i had friends			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While I've very much enjoyed the original Poker Night at the Inventory, it's sequel, Poker Night 2, is generally quite lackluster and omits vital customizations included with its predecessor. First and foremost, you can no longer skip the table chat and cannot change the amount of discussion by the other players. While amusing at first, it doesn't take long to exhaust the included dialogue, leading to hearing the exact same gags game after game after game. There's also the bizarre choice by the developers to include Ash from the Evil Dead film series, yet the character isn't voiced by Bruce Campbell. Instead we're treated to a thoroughly awful impersonation, both in terms of performance and writing. Furthermore, the way they use Claptrap makes me even less likely go any further with Borderlands, though in part this stems from how often he repeats himself, yet never shuts up. The high point of the game would be GLADOS from the Portal series, handling the job of dealer. Sadly that doesn't do too much for me when I really dislike most of the other players. Sam from Sam & Max is cool, but as is true to his character, also rather low key. I really thought this would be an excellent sequel, but I'm disappointed to say that I'll be keeping Poker Night at the Inventory as my default casual poker game and will merely make use of Poker Night 2 on rare occasions when I feel like something different. One and a half stars out of four.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ahh Poker. A game for great war heros, not tiny baby men. You, the player, must face off your age old nemsis, the A.I., in a high stakes showdown for honor, glory, and  helluva bunch of virtual chippies. Face off against iconic characters like Claptrap from Borderlands, Sam from Sam & Max, and GLaDOS from Portal, and prove to them your the richer man (Unlike me, who's 300,000 dollars broke). Win awesome prizes and rewards for bonus content in Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands. Show lady luck that you don't need her to win! (Oh, and there's also Omaha but I have no idea what that is but PLAY IT ANYWAYS).Without a doubt, this game scores very high on the list of games that probably died and went to valhalla.                                                                                                                                                                        ~THEHAMMERNOOB			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The reason you're playing a Poker Night game is for the characters, and Poker Night 2's cast is excellent. Claptrap is at his annoying best, Sam (and Max, from the bench) are amusingly absurd, Ash is as smooth as he was in Evil Dead, and Brock is voiced impeccably - and aggressively - by Patrick Warburton. The dealer, namely Glados, is at her acerbic best, humiliating and degrading at every opportunity. If those characters sound like fun to you, you'll have an enjoyable poker sim to play.As for the unlocks, while I can't speak for the Team Fortress 2 items, the Borderlands 2 items are excellent and humorous. Playing as a human-sized turret from Portal is worth the price of admission by itself.Note to achievement hunters and perfectionists: unlike the last Poker Night game, the achievements in PN2 are all fair (Poker Night 1 required a victory by straight flush for its final achievement, a 72,192 : 1 chance).

												Poker Night 2 is another excellent title from Telltale; they did a great job with the banter and captured the character personalities quite well. The voice acting is good and the interacting between characters doesn't seem forced. My only criticism would be the character AIs seem to respond to stimulus the same - it would be cool if Brock did more bluffing than Claptrap (for instance). I also did some experimenting and the computer responds the same regardless of the player's actions from hand to hand. If they wanted this game or a certain character to be really top-notch they should use some kind of Markov model to evaluate player actions. In any case this is a great choice for some casual gaming on a laptop or when you want to be able to walk away from a game for minutes or hours at a time during play. 8/10 for a casual title.

												Do you like card games? Do you even consider yourself a cardshark, able to take off the most skilled bluffers and gamblers singlehandedly? Well try out this Poker game by Tell Tale Games. If you beat it, you can feel not robbed... but reconsider, they might rob you off your time. The personas in this game are well drawn, and very coherent in their behavioural patterns. As soon as you have learned what specific sentences or motions mean, you'll know when they are bluffing. This game is fun to play, as long as you don't overdo it, playing more than a tournament a day doesn't do anything good. The achievements in this game are a gift, they are reached easily most of the time - that is, if you don't blunder on an epic scale.I recomend this game to all people who like a good set of cards, and to friends of Evil Dead, Sam & Max, Borderland-Series, Portal... Oh, yes I have forgotten Brock ^^ Well - never mind.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

TL;DR nutshell - Fun poker game, great music (why can't it be purchased? *sad panda face*), fun dialogue, better than the first installment.  Downside is that it's pretty short, and the dialogue gets really repetitive.The ""Once she drinks coffee, she doesn't shut up for hours"" version:It's a decent game from Tell Tale.  We have the murder-machine Brock Samson from Venture Bros (highly recommended show to watch), the ever obnoxiously annoying CL4P-TP unit from the Borderlands franchise (play the games, they're fun), Ashley Williams from the Evil Dead franchise (I don't like horror so no opinion), and Sam from the Sam and Max franchise all together at the same table, being taunted and experimented on by with GLaDOS as your dealer.There are five challenges in total to get through to get the downloadable unlocks, and five felt/chip/card combos to get which have their own set of stories to go with them that don't appear if you only have one or two unlocks on.  The possible challenges are funny, as I don't know if I can actually deploy ninjas, want to take an asprin and call someone in the morning or do the hokey pokey.  Some are challenging as all get out, like ""Win with only a high card"".  This time around, there is no difficulty setting, which I found disappointing.  The music is amazing, especially the slow piano version of ""Still Alive"", and the variations on all of the theme tunes, like the opening theme to Borderlands 2 ""No Heroes"".The two complaints I really have are these: 1) the game is far too short, and getting the unlocks are too easy for the most part.  I end up deleting all of the saves and starting over, just to keep it interesting.2) they could have recorded a lot more dialogue, especially for GLaDOS.  Don't get me wrong, the dialogue is really funny, but to be told ""Well, that was a clever move that won't come back to bite you in your ample posterior"" over and over and over and over and over again gets old fast.  That and their reactions to you going all in.It took a while for me to get the rules of Omaha, but I finally got it figured out.  Now, if I could only get into a showdown with someone other than Sam...Poker Night 2 is a good game to play while eating supper, or killing a few minutes before you have to leave.  It's not in any way a ""great"" game, but just a, ""Meh, I'll play this to murder some minutes while I eat/wait"".			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												EXTREMELY WORTH BUYING. A HALOVER9000 BEST BUY. for what that's worth.Mouse-only. For this alone, it is a good game. Go ahead and read this, because you don't have a life. Nor do I. The review gives: Why One Might Buy, Should I Buy, How To Win, and Bonuses.Be honest; many of us now game instead of watch movies or infomercials to fall asleep. Mouse-only is crucial then, as well as when wanting to Let Her Sleep, or when encumbered with the flu.Then there are those who relish the mashup in music, the homages (pronounced oh-MAHH-zhes) to predecessors in science-fiction movies, and cross-cultural expansions in gaming. This game, like Poker Night At The Inventory, directly uses other iconoclasts from other games and media. Seeing them interact, regardless of your opinion of some of them, is good for dozens of hours of entertainment.OK, for poker, it's a bit tougher than other games.........Several of the players are cavalier, and at least one is as cold as steel. Hence, drink tokens. They're not just useful for seeing Moxxi's lady parts walk by. One can earn, and spend selectively, drink tokens to instantly change much of the other players' conducts and rule systems.OK, for poker, then it can be a bit easier than other games........BONUSES: Winning drops up to 5 Team-Fortress-2 items. Winning also drops up to 5 skins/accessories for Borderlands-2. Winning a Borderlands-2-themed tournament also gives an extra Badass Rank point to spend in BL2. And A Perfect Steam Achivement Game might be easier than with other games. I'm a Waaay Casual Gamer, and I have all but one Steam Achievement on this game.At five bucks each, both Poker Nights are worth it. At $2.49, you should be buying both on the spot. And, if they're ever 99 cents again, it's a NO-BRAINER.I'm Hal Over 9000; I'm nobody; this is me caring about you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Before I begin, I will say that I did get this game for the promotional items... However!This game is actually pretty fun! When I started, I had no idea how to play poker and was kind of dreading the experience.The game has characters I like such as Sam & Max and Claptrap; all of the characters speak to eachother and actually seem like people rather than AI when playing the game. Their humour and jokes kept me entertained throughout and I would actually recommend it to a lot of people, even if you have never played Poker before :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Yes It can get annoying once you have heard all the comments and they repeat themselfs, though still this is a good fun poker game which also helped me to learn how to actually play poker. 6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First impression review!After replaying the first Poker Night at the Inventory, I decided to go ahead and get the second one during a sale. These are my first impressions of the game.First off, the atmosphere seems a bit less cozy, the chatter amount can't be changed nor can you skip the chats. I do find the new characters a bit dissapointing compared to the older crew, who felt a lot livier and these just throw more mean snarks and remarks instead of fully chatting with eachother. Although I do like the inclusion of GlaDOS as dealer, she's just an awesome dealer with the right amount of evil. Sam definitely makes more jokes with his partner compared to Max in part one, which is also nice.The poker itself felt as good as always with a better unlocking system than the previous one. The ability to buy the ones you want makes it a lot more rewarding. Since you don't have to wait for the ones you really want. There is a new gamemode, Omaha, but I haven't touched that one yet. Overall, the game still feels fresh and fun if you're bored of the first one. It has new jokes, new characters and new visual flair to unlock. There are a few things downgrades compared to the other one (unskippable stuff, lesser settings etc) but they're not too bothersome. So if you're a fan of the first, go ahead and try it out!

												I can't honestly say I'm that big of a poker player, but I do know how the game works and I think I safetly say that this is a pretty solid game.At only five dollars there is so much value here because it just isn't a simple poker game. Telltale has taken their IP's and in cooperation with Valve combined all the different characters from their games into a very entertaining game. Their care with regards to character, story telling and good writing really shows and make this game a the stand out that it is. Because without the funny dialogue this game could have so easily gone the other way and been utterly terrible.A more detailed review for a game that doesn't need a more detailed review can be found on my blog here: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2013/09/poker-night-2.html.

												In all honesty if you want this game because it's poker it's a very poor game. It constantly reads the hand you have incorrectly - many many times I would have a straight or full-house but it'd only see a pair or two-pair. You'll be face palming so often your head will start to concave. Seriously how did this even pass play testing?If you want it for the TF2 and BL2 achievement items it's... alright? The items are only for looks. Which isn't really a bad thing. Some look better than others. Overall that's the main reason I keep playing it. I feel the items are needed to get my money's worth.The meaty part of this game though really is the characters. That part gets a 10/10. GLaDOS especially is hilarious. The only reason I recommend it is for the character appeal. It feels like you're really sitting down with some stars and not in front of a bunch of computers.If you know how to play poker this game will leave you infuriated at it's faulty programming. If you don't know how to play poker this game will confuse you even more, but you'll be less infuriated.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly I bought it for the tf2 items but this is actually a really good game for the price. The dialouge is hilarious and there's a ton of dialouge. If you want the tf2 items play the game because it's a good game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game Poker Night 2 is a quirky humor based poker game where you can play texas or omaha hold 'em. The game is simplistic and incredibly fun. The whole thing starts out with a basic intro to poker familiarizing you with all the different hands and basic winning strategies. While most play these games for the acheivement items you'll find yourself so unintentionally sucked in by it's charm that items will come without effort. The game RARELY has issues and the issues I'm talking about are things like an important flop being dealt that will skip some dialougue but the game tries to keep things like that at a minimum. All in all poker night 2 is a hallarious game that is without a doubt worth the 5 bucks it costs. BUY THIS GAME			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've made more money in this game, than the entirety of my GTA Online career.I haven't been insulted this much even in a public game of CSGO.I haven't been insulted this much even by my mother in law... well...I've never wanted there to be a ""flip table"" button in a game this much.I go all in since the cards are in my favor, 100%, only to have the last card ♥♥♥♥ me over because ofcourse.And it happened multiple times.Even Dark Souls wasn't as frustrating as this.I grew to appreciate how easy it was to get the achievement items in the original Poker Night.I haven't been in this much debt in all of the city builders out there, combined.I wouldn't want Claptrap to be left in a junkyard, since it'd be too cruel for the junkyard.Atleast I got cosmetic items.

												6.9/10 - Improvement on the Original in all areas.The first Poker Night really didn't do it for me; it felt incomplete and way too easy! This one however improves everything and closes those gaps from the first.If you like casual poker this is a good buy for $5.This installment has tournaments, stats, achievements and some pretty fun gameplay. You can also use your earnings to purchase decks, chips and various table felts. It DOES get annoying listening to the competition banter. Sometimes they will go on for quite a bit and as far as I know you can't skip it. It's like trying too hard to be funny and create additional interest. Overall; this is a fun poker offering. Worth $5. Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more. Free Keys and Reviews weekly!

												Poke Night 2, the sequel to the first Poker Night. I have mixed emotions about this game. For one, this game IS fun, but can get boring quickly and repetitive. Most people get this game for ""Team Fortress 2"" or ""Borderlands"" items. Lets start off with me saying that the first Poker Night didn't work on my OS even though it said it would. This, however, does work (Macbook Pro, Yosemite). This game IS self explanitory. It's basically just playing Texas Hold em'. Over. And over again.Really, theres not much to say. Get the game ONLY if you want to play cards alot OR to earn items for different games, even though it will take a while. If you are a nub like me, you wouldn't know how to play Texas Hold Em'. If you don't, don't get this game. Seriously, unless you want to take the time to learn.I do NOT recommend this repetetive game. Go out and play cards in real life with your friends and or family members. I rate this 4.5/10. Even though this game is on sale, I rather save my money for something else.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fun game with bad poker mechanics, mostly amusing characters (I can barely stand Claptrap in the Borderlands series, he isn't much better here), and a bounty/unlockable reward system that half works. The challenge system for gaining the opportunity to unlock bounties is a step-up from the RNG of the last game (which lead to me restarting until I got bounty games after the dialogue became stale). GLaDOS is excellent as always, and having her as the dealer was a wise move.When it comes down to it though, actual poker players say it's nothing like playing poker, and the unlockable bounties for Borderlands 2 straight up don't work; it's possible to get them if you contact Gearbox support, but I think when you have to open a ticket to recieve what is debateably the biggest selling point of the game, the product is fundamentally flawed.This isn't a game for poker players or collectors.

												I don't know what it is, but there's something magical about this game that makes me enjoy it so much. It's very odd, given the circumstances, I would have thought I'd never get this addicted to a simple card game, and it doesn't help that before playing this, I didn't play card games at all. As I started to play the game more, however, I started getting the hang of how things worked in Texas Hold 'Em and I started developing stradegies. Now, I'm the only one in my family that can play poker, and I won't let them forget that. I've been constantly asking members of my family to learn how to play so I could have someone to play with instead of the computer, and my addiction was only taken further when I started learning other card games outside of poker. I know the story I just told was a little off-topic, but it's a big factor in what made me like this game so much. Poker just got addicting to me, and I'd just keep coming back to this game which some could argue is repetitive.That's just my personal opinion though, I think poker is really fun. If you want an action-packed game with tons of variety, you're not going to find it here. It's just poker. Still, there are some things about this game that sets it aside from playing real poker. The fact that they were able to get together a wide variety of interesting characters with comedic personalities is great, and the conversations between the characters really sets a great atmosphere. The problem with this is, the conversations repeat. A lot. The jokes are funny, but you won't be laughing at them by the 40th time they're told.I also like how this game rewards you for accomplishing things. You'll win not just virtual money, but also items and accessories in Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2. So that's pretty cool.Oh, and GLADoS is the dealer. You can't go wrong there.In my personal opinion, I'd give this game a 9/10. It's very fun and addicting, and the characters that you play with are great. I'd recommend this to anybody who plays poker.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I actually really liked this game.It improved a lot on its predecessor - I especially liked the customizable environments which produced some different KO's when a player went bust.Playable characters arguably not as interesting, but the inclusion of GlaDOS more than made up for it.Most people picked this game up to get some TF2 items, I liked that the gameplay was a bit more mixed up and that you had to complete certain achievements to progress and get an item.On a side note, there's a common hack/cheat with Steam Achievement Manager which people used to get the item w/o completing the game, because apparently virtual texas hold'em is too difficult. sheesh			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let's compare to Poker Night 1: The dialogue started repeating much earlier, and you're no longer allowed to skip it. On the other hand, there were a couple of conversation arcs which were apprently set up to take place over the course of several sessions of play, which was interesting. I didn't suspect I'd like the cast of characters as much as the original, especially the guys on the right, but everybody turned out to be pretty likeable. There are still table, card and now chip style unlocks, and you don't need to win games to get them; instead, you're given three random 'challenges' which usually aren't too horrible, and then completing these challenges and winning a game unlocks cool stuff for Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2. I guess it is a better system than the previous. Unlocking matching club motif sets actually changes the whole Inventory's look to that theme, such as a Borderlands one and a Portal one, and that was pretty cool. The AI now seems to cheat like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ way more than I remember.Uuuuhhhh you know what, I'll just call it about even. Even if this one doesn't have Heavy Weapons Guy in it. Actually I was kinda hoping for the Engineer this time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Poker just got addicting to me, and I'd just keep coming back to this game which some could argue is repetitive.That's just my personal opinion though, I think poker is really fun. If you want an action-packed game with tons of variety, you're not going to find it here. It's just poker. Still, there are some things about this game that sets it aside from playing real poker. The fact that they were able to get together a wide variety of interesting characters with comedic personalities is great, and the conversations between the characters really sets a great atmosphere. The problem with this is, the conversations repeat. A lot. The jokes are funny, but you won't be laughing at them by the 40th time they're told.I also like how this game rewards you for accomplishing things. You'll win not just virtual money, but also items and accessories in Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2. So that's pretty cool.Oh, and GLADoS is the dealer. You can't go wrong there.In my personal opinion, I'd give this game a 9/10. It's very fun and addicting, and the characters that you play with are great. I'd recommend this to anybody who plays poker.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Click Here for the Full Review! [monthsbehindreviews.blogspot.com]Synopsis: A fun game that expands upon the original by including an additional play mode - Omaha style poker. In addition, the AI system has be revamped and over all this game is much more difficult than it's predecessor.  The unlock system has also been improved, both for in game items like tables, cards, and chips, as well as the cross promotional items that you'll get for Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2. There are some flaws here though, particularly a fringe case in the item unlock system that will make you want to break something, and an AI that seems to get far too lucky on the final card. Still, not a bad game to pick up and play in 20-30 minute increments.The amount of time you can get out of this one varies based on how good/lucky you are, and just what it is you expect to get out of the game. I put in 15 hours or so to get everything in game and all but one achievement, which I could probably have in the next hour or so. I've rated it a 7/10, and recommend picking it up at $2.50, though I have seen it as low as $0.99.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game features Brock Samson, Claptrap, Sam, and Ash. In this game, you play pokers with these characters, and the more you play the more stuff you unlock, and the more fun you have. To be honest, I only bought this for items, but upon playing it more, I had a lot of fun playing poker with some amazing characters with great personalites. I recommend this game, and hope for more updates in the future. Only thing missing is Online, other than that 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I can't even tell if the actual game is good because it keeps crashing.EDIT: If you can actually get it working, there is some fun to be had with this game, especially if you are fan of the characters.

												I liked Poker Night 2's bounty system, and the banter is always good, but this actually felt like a step backward from the first game. Not being able to control how talkable the characters are is a feature that was sorely missing.And the characters themselves seemed a bit less interesting. In general I felt like they had fewer lines of dialogue and repeated themselves more. There was also a distinctive feeling of the AI cheating on the final card flip. There were some incredibly unlikely outcomes that kept happening hand after hand after hand.So at the end of the day if you like playing poker against an AI you'll like this, but I actually think the first one is the better of the two.

												Poker Night 2 is an improvement on Poker Night at the Inventory and it adds so much content that you'll be hopping around your room squeeing with joy. I love this title and I know that I could easily hop back into it to play poker with some really amazing and hilarious characters. It has wit, humour, visuals and plenty of great moments. The unlocks are fantastic, the gameplay gets you hooked and most of all it's the conversations and unique 'themed' poker rooms that get me wanting to play it more and more in order to hear what all the characters talk about. And even better, the game is under £5. Why don't you just stop reading this and buy the game already. You will love it. Trust me. It's amazing. And if you don't believe me then go watch my livestreams or other highlights! There's fun to be had!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL;DR : Plain mo**er**cking awesome. Come on, it's GLaDOS and Cl4P-TR4PI love this game, I used to be a noob in IRL poker but I got better with playing this game.Yeah I first bought this for the free items for BL2 and TF2, and this was also on sale, so all great stuff.In my opinion, the AI is good. Well it isn't perfect, of course, but it's not too challenging nor too easy, and although people say this is 'rigged', I think it's just plain luck. Winning a 20000 bet with Ace high or a Straight Flush is so magnificent to the Max. The characters, as you see, are great, including GLaDOS. Well, tbh you need to be open-minded and accept jokes coming to you as humour and not insult, because what they comment are overly amusing. Yes, it does get repetitive at times, but the fact that the game keeps running on background (they do checks and raises and all that stuff while the convo goes, and you can too) so if a dialogue is repeating, you can 'skip' it in your head. I'd say 10/10, better than it's prequel. Oh, and with the virtual Inventory Tokens, you can also buy your opponents drinks, and make them make more hints or their cards.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So, Poker Night 2, the follow-up game from the Poker Night at the Inventory, featuring new characters, new dialogue, new atmosphere, new, almost everything. Question is, did it succeed in what it did like it did in the first one?Let's start with the story: it's simple (yet again), beginning with the Inventory, a secret poker place for people to play Poker together for high stakes (this time for $20k instead of $10k).You play as The Player, who is presumably the same person you play as in the first Poker Night game, who is yet again, the silent and never-talking one, yet recognized still and warmly welcomed as you arrive from your limo to The Inventory.That is essentially the story in a nutshell: it's simple, it's true to the nature of Poker Night, and it's just a little more fun than the first one, I feel.Now onto the aspects of the game:Game AspectScoreSide NotesGraphics10/10 The game looks much more polished and vibrant than the first, and the characters still look true to their natureDialogue 4/10 The character's speeches was very specific and not improved at all from the first game, in fact having maybe 5 minutes worth Soundtrack 7.6/10 The soundtrack isn't as fitting as the first game's soundtrack, but it's still awesome as hell nonetheless Gameplay (differences) 10/10 I love the improvements made upon this game's gameplay: ordering drinks for people, the idea of Bounty Challenges, earning coins for winning tournaments to spend on felts, chips, and card changes, and the game winning is as satsifying as the first game AI 10/10 Much like the first one, this game's ai is believable, and even occassionally bluffs its way through the game Atmosphere 3/10 Between the dialogue and the character picks, I just can't imagine actually sitting down at a poker table playing Texas Hold'em with these characters: they're just, too diverse in personality Overall Score 7/10 This game's score tanked because of its overall atmosphere that it delivers; it delivers the feel that you need to win, or else be judged from these characters Side Notes If you're in it for the tf2/Borderlands2 items, and don't mind the atmosphere, then by all means it's worth the $5: if you're looking for a good poker game, though, I'd just stick with the first game   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Question is, did it succeed in what it did like it did in the first one?Let's start with the story: it's simple (yet again), beginning with the Inventory, a secret poker place for people to play Poker together for high stakes (this time for $20k instead of $10k).You play as The Player, who is presumably the same person you play as in the first Poker Night game, who is yet again, the silent and never-talking one, yet recognized still and warmly welcomed as you arrive from your limo to The Inventory.That is essentially the story in a nutshell: it's simple, it's true to the nature of Poker Night, and it's just a little more fun than the first one, I feel.Now onto the aspects of the game:Game AspectScoreSide NotesGraphics10/10 The game looks much more polished and vibrant than the first, and the characters still look true to their natureDialogue 4/10 The character's speeches was very specific and not improved at all from the first game, in fact having maybe 5 minutes worth Soundtrack 7.6/10 The soundtrack isn't as fitting as the first game's soundtrack, but it's still awesome as hell nonetheless Gameplay (differences) 10/10 I love the improvements made upon this game's gameplay: ordering drinks for people, the idea of Bounty Challenges, earning coins for winning tournaments to spend on felts, chips, and card changes, and the game winning is as satsifying as the first game AI 10/10 Much like the first one, this game's ai is believable, and even occassionally bluffs its way through the game Atmosphere 3/10 Between the dialogue and the character picks, I just can't imagine actually sitting down at a poker table playing Texas Hold'em with these characters: they're just, too diverse in personality Overall Score 7/10 This game's score tanked because of its overall atmosphere that it delivers; it delivers the feel that you need to win, or else be judged from these characters Side Notes If you're in it for the tf2/Borderlands2 items, and don't mind the atmosphere, then by all means it's worth the $5: if you're looking for a good poker game, though, I'd just stick with the first game   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL;DR : Plain mo**er**cking awesome. Come on, it's GLaDOS and Cl4P-TR4PI love this game, I used to be a noob in IRL poker but I got better with playing this game.Yeah I first bought this for the free items for BL2 and TF2, and this was also on sale, so all great stuff.In my opinion, the AI is good. Well it isn't perfect, of course, but it's not too challenging nor too easy, and although people say this is 'rigged', I think it's just plain luck. Winning a 20000 bet with Ace high or a Straight Flush is so magnificent to the Max. The characters, as you see, are great, including GLaDOS. Well, tbh you need to be open-minded and accept jokes coming to you as humour and not insult, because what they comment are overly amusing. Yes, it does get repetitive at times, but the fact that the game keeps running on background (they do checks and raises and all that stuff while the convo goes, and you can too) so if a dialogue is repeating, you can 'skip' it in your head. I'd say 10/10, better than it's prequel. Oh, and with the virtual Inventory Tokens, you can also buy your opponents drinks, and make them make more hints or their cards.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all: I know this game was made to cash in on children that only want TF2 items. That said, here are the reasons why the devs should be ashamed of releasing this:-The strategies of the AI make no sense: When they bet or raise it's always a couple times the pot size, they call all ins with really crappy cards, they fall for standard poker tactics, etc.-When you play like an actual sane person would do, the portal robot is all over your face saying that you suck. Every single time. When you make a standard bet, the other players say that you suck.-To win those TF2 and borderlands 2 items, you have to complete challenges. But most 'challenges' ENCOURAGE you to play really bad. Example: win a showdown with 2 players. In a 5 player tourney, right.-The animations are borky-The conversations get really boring and repetitive. The one that annoys me the most is the blonde guy making an all in move.-The design of some card decks give me the creeps. What genius thought of a card deck where you have to stare 5 seconds to every card to discover which cards you actually have?-There is only 1 word to describe the design of the menu: tedious.Luckily, there are some good things about the game as well:-The conversations are well written in general. Sometimes they make you feel like the players are just casually folding or calling. Surprisingly, the claptrap conversations are the funniest. After an hour of playing they get repetitive though.-On rare occasions there are hands where the AI isn't completely dumb.Buy it for €1 if you want the items. If you're looking for a poker game: don't.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If everything that is great in the world sat down to play pokerWith a dog, a robot, a god among men, a badass, and another robot. Seriously though, five dollars is a fantastic bargain on Poker Night 2, especially if you know and love the characters like I do. The TF2 and Borderlands 2 unlocks are pretty awesome too! Enjoy hilarious dialogue between beloved characters and slam down a couple-a-beers. All around, it's a pretty great time. there are a few gripes here though.1. WARNING! THE BORDERLANDS 2 UNLOCKS DO NOT WORK AS THEY SHOULD. I HAD TO CONTACT GEARBOX SOFTWARE TO RECIEVE THEM. 2. Dialogue loops. This happens quite often and unlike PN2s predecessor, this game has no option to lower the amount of poker table chatter or outright skip it. The jokes are hilarious, but can get grating. 3. Ash isn't voiced by Bruce Campbell. :P Not a serious complaint, as the VA does a good job, but I would've LOVED to see him reprise the role.Wonderful game. The funniest I've played in years, the best crossover that isn't Smash Bros i've seen, and getting the Max mask for the Mechromancer in Borderlands 2 is just awesome. I fully reccomend a full price purchase.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gambling is EVIL! I can tell from my own experiences.One of the safest place to play poker is at the Inventory. You can't lose money here, if we don't calculate the game's price to our loss.A great amount of humorous conversations made me laugh several times, but after a while they become repetitive of course. In my opinion the character Sam doesn't really needed here, cauz Max already took part in the first episode. Come on, there are a lots of funny game heroes out there to pick up. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Other than that, this is a good single-player poker game held back only by the fact that it's a single-player poker game.

												Telltale still doesn't seem to ♥♥♥♥ing understand how a deck of cards works. CARDS DO NOT HAVE DUPLICATES IN A DECK. Otherwise they did a solid job, even despite the huge middle finger to PC (O gaming industry, y u do this so much) release job. All the characters are alright this time around, though they insult you a tad much for my taste. While with the first game, say, Tycho would go 'Those cards will do!' in response to me winning a hand. While in this game everyone is mute and only criticizes you. The group definetly doesn't seem as friendly this time around, though the characters interactions are handled much better. Also Omaha FTW <3. As a poker game, this fails horribley. As a fun game with some unique characters/dialogue? It's pretty good. 6.1/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let's compare to Poker Night 1: The dialogue started repeating much earlier, and you're no longer allowed to skip it. On the other hand, there were a couple of conversation arcs which were apprently set up to take place over the course of several sessions of play, which was interesting. I didn't suspect I'd like the cast of characters as much as the original, especially the guys on the right, but everybody turned out to be pretty likeable. There are still table, card and now chip style unlocks, and you don't need to win games to get them; instead, you're given three random 'challenges' which usually aren't too horrible, and then completing these challenges and winning a game unlocks cool stuff for Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2. I guess it is a better system than the previous. Unlocking matching club motif sets actually changes the whole Inventory's look to that theme, such as a Borderlands one and a Portal one, and that was pretty cool. The AI now seems to cheat like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ way more than I remember.Uuuuhhhh you know what, I'll just call it about even. Even if this one doesn't have Heavy Weapons Guy in it. Actually I was kinda hoping for the Engineer this time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I liked Poker Night 2's bounty system, and the banter is always good, but this actually felt like a step backward from the first game. Not being able to control how talkable the characters are is a feature that was sorely missing.And the characters themselves seemed a bit less interesting. In general I felt like they had fewer lines of dialogue and repeated themselves more. There was also a distinctive feeling of the AI cheating on the final card flip. There were some incredibly unlikely outcomes that kept happening hand after hand after hand.So at the end of the day if you like playing poker against an AI you'll like this, but I actually think the first one is the better of the two.

												A humorous Poker Game Simulator where you play against Claptrap from Borderlands, Brock Samson from The Venture Bros., Ash from The Evil Dead and Sam from Sam and Max. Your card dealer is GLaDOS from Portal.If you like simulated card games then this game is phenomenal. The continuous comedy only increases the enjoyment - I've never lost all of my money and had a smile on my face in real life.10/10 Poker Simulator.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A game of poker with quips from the likes of Brock Samson from the Venture Brothers, Ash from Evildead, Claptrap from Borderlands, along with the Freelance Police Sam and Max. Oh, and you, the silent player. Play hands of Texas Hold 'Em or Omaha with the host GLaDOS from Portal. Go down as one of the greater poker players at the green table, or be a tremendous failure after busting and losing $20,000 (You'll most likely be busted by Ash, he's an♥♥♥♥♥like that). A good, casual game to pass the time if you have a few minutes. Sadly, there's no multiplayer and no other characters besides the ones listed above. Buy this during a sale for less than 5 dollars if you have some money to burn and want a casual game to play once in a while. Get it if you really like poker, otherwise you might want to throw your money somewhere else. A bonus to this game would be the multiple TF2 items you get from collecting ""special items"" from each of the characters, such as a Spike TV 2012 VGA award from Claptrap. To get them, you have to do a series of simple bounties during one tournament, and beat the next tournament to win the item. The TF2 items are quite nice, but the weapons have no value or different stats except for being achievement items.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Poker Night 2 is an improvement on Poker Night at the Inventory and it adds so much content that you'll be hopping around your room squeeing with joy. I love this title and I know that I could easily hop back into it to play poker with some really amazing and hilarious characters. It has wit, humour, visuals and plenty of great moments. The unlocks are fantastic, the gameplay gets you hooked and most of all it's the conversations and unique 'themed' poker rooms that get me wanting to play it more and more in order to hear what all the characters talk about. And even better, the game is under £5. Why don't you just stop reading this and buy the game already. You will love it. Trust me. It's amazing. And if you don't believe me then go watch my livestreams or other highlights! There's fun to be had!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I guess all there is to say about this is to heck with the poker part give me more Glados and Claptrap!!!!!!!! All in all this game is good; however, a little lack luster and the puns get used far to much. You will play for two hours and hear the same jokes after that. Definitely worth buying for at least the Borderlands 2 and TF2 items and skins. rating: 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Both of the Poker Nights games from Telltale are absolutely worth a few bucks just for the humor alone, and are a great way to learn how to play Poker too. You'll probably play 5-10 matches before the dialog starts to repeat, so the replay value here is limited, but the price is fair.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The AI acts in a much different way than it did in the first game, more bluffing for example.

												Poker Night 2 is an extremely offensive CoD rip-off, the bad things about it are:No teams, you're always playing Free-for-all.You can't choose what you're holding in your hand, it's completely random.Changing your decorations doesn't alter your gameplay or give you a tactical advantage on your opponents.Brock's a c*nt.Ash isn't really any better.CL4P-TP is an obnoxious down syndrome with the mental age of 2.I think Sam is okay, but he pisses me off by folding every single f**king hand.Also, another thing that annoys me about Sam is everytime someone goes all-in he shouts ""GOOD DAY IN THE MORNING."".

												I liked Poker Night 2's bounty system, and the banter is always good, but this actually felt like a step backward from the first game. Not being able to control how talkable the characters are is a feature that was sorely missing.And the characters themselves seemed a bit less interesting. In general I felt like they had fewer lines of dialogue and repeated themselves more. There was also a distinctive feeling of the AI cheating on the final card flip. There were some incredibly unlikely outcomes that kept happening hand after hand after hand.So at the end of the day if you like playing poker against an AI you'll like this, but I actually think the first one is the better of the two.

												Quirky fun with a cast of characters from media I enjoy. The banter between the NPC players is quite hilarious. Some of it gets repetitive if you play for awhile, but changing the scenery with unlockables can change the game theme, atmosphere and dialogue some. The extras for other games from winning bounties doesn't hurt either.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Five dollars doesn't usually get you much. This game TEARS DOWN that wall. Now, this game is NOT for everybody. It has a BUNCH of jokes, but at least 85% of them are at the expence of the player. Also, being a poker game, if you don't know how to play texas hold em', this game is not for you. Lastly, and this one is UNFORGIVABLE, no multiplayer. A poker game, WITHOUT MULTIPLAYER! (I'm gonna let that sink in for a second.) Still, this is a well made game.The AI is NOT like Mario Party's on hard/expert. (In other words, it's not 100% cheap and OP.) It's jokes are amazing! (If you're ok with videogame charactors making fun of you, that is.) And, well... FREEKING POKER! Also, TF2 and Borderlands 2 unlocks. 'Nough said. Now if this was 10 or 15 bucks, STAY AWAY! But with it's $5 tag, GO STRAIGHT FOR IT! 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The banter between characters always livens things up, and the unlockable items including customizable decks, chips, and felts are something to countinue playing and striving for, not to mention achievements.

												Very cool and neat game with a very cheap price too. You can unlock cosmetic items for both TF2 and Borderlands 2, which is pretty cool. The graphics are really nice and colourful and the game is simple and easy to learn.What makes this stand out is that there is a ton of funny dialogue for the characters and seeing how the characters interacted was really cool, which is a really good motivation to keep playing and unlocking more items to hear more dialogue and situtions, plus it really makes me wish for an Evil Dead telltale adventure game starring Bruce Campbell.Definitely worth a pick up if you want to unlock some items and have a calm game of poker after playing some other games.

And all the characters are awesome, accurate to their official counterparts, and fun to play Poker with. I'm most familiar with Brock Samson from The Venture Bros and Ash Williams from the Evil Dead franchise. I'm also so glad that GLaDOS, one of my favorite characters from the Portal franchise and one of my favorite robot characters of all time, is actually in this game! And the way GLaDOS hosts the tournaments and taunts everyone is hilarious and accurate to herself in the Portal franchise! I actually find this game as awesome as the first!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Poker with who? Poker with your Favourite video game characters! You have Claptrap, from Borderlands, who is funny and makes the game humorous at all times.You have Ash Williams, from ""The Evil Dead"" franchise, who makes cunning remarks, of how great he is.You have Brock Samson, from Adult Swim, who likes to bet a whole ton of money every time.You have Sam, from the ""Sam & Max"" games, who likes to talk about his adventures, while you have your own poker ones.You have GlaDOS, from the ""Portal"" games, who narrates the Poker game, and talks about various ways to kill you...And you have the quiet Moxxie, from ""Borderlands"" who serves the drinks, to make ya'll drunk!This is a mix up of different styles, and the gameplay is amazing! I love Poker Night 2!When you win, you dont just have the satisfaction of winning, but you can get Money to help you make the place look like your favourite game, and you can win prizes for various games, Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2.I think this game is worth every little cent I payed for it. Its a truely spectacular game, and i'd buy a sequel if it came out!8.5/10Highly Recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gambling is EVIL! I can tell from my own experiences.One of the safest place to play poker is at the Inventory. You can't lose money here, if we don't calculate the game's price to our loss.A great amount of humorous conversations made me laugh several times, but after a while they become repetitive of course. In my opinion the character Sam doesn't really needed here, cauz Max already took part in the first episode. Come on, there are a lots of funny game heroes out there to pick up. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quite an interesting way to play free poker. It really provides the entertainment people require.PROS1. Fun GamePlaying poker has never been so interesting. All the insance antics and the interesting conversations held by the characters. E.g. All the false information about dogs from Sam.I especially liked the themed sets. E.g. Steve from Borderlands 2 and his ""Heyoo""2. CharactersAll of them are so funny. I love Claptrap the most. I was hoping Moxxi would speak though.3. Probability CalculationsI appreciate showing the probability though I wish you would teach us how you arrive at the number.4. Crossover Game RewardsNice. Love the free skins for winning.CONS1. No Multiplayer ****Such a fun game and you can't play multiplayer. What a waste. I felt that Telltale could easily make themselves one of the top games on Steam by allowing for multiplayer. Perhaps they have some restrictions regarding publishing online gambling software but I would like to point out that Dota 2 already encourages gambling in the form of match predictions using CASH.2. Nothing to DistractWhile waiting for the NPCs to decide (which should be instant), maybe there could be something interesting to do in the few seconds in between.3. No Concrete Assurance That It's Not RiggedI don't see anything anywhere in the game that points out that it is not rigged. So far the best assurance I've come across is a forum post. The idea that the game is rigged to win at some points and lost at others takes away a certain portion of fun.SUGGESTIONS1. Assurance of Non-Rigging/CheatingMaybe you could have a small option in the Menu that points out how Telltale codes the game to be non-cheating. 2. MultiplayerYou could attract all the seniors in their retirement to Steam, thereby helping to make Steam a true company for all.3. Other Card GamesBridge, Taipan, Baccarat, Blackjack, Big 2 etc... The list is endless. Why stop at Poker? You could corner the market on non-cash card games on Steam. I AM HIGHLY AGAINST USING REAL MONEY TO BET ON STEAM GAMES. IF YOU DO MAKE A POKER NIGHT 3 WITH MULTIPLAYER, DO NOT ADD A REAL MONEY COMPONENT OR ALLOW PLAYERS TO MAKE REAL MONEY SIDE BETS.4. Newbie TutorialHave a simple section teaching how to calculate the probability of winning with your hand. This will teach advanced mathematics to MILLIONS of players. This would be optional as some people just hate math.5. Protect People from Cheating You could also teach them about the dark side of poker, like the cheating. This would help to protect the public from cheats in real life. E.g.""cooler decks"", palming cards, marking cards, false shuffles.Treat this like an act of charity.6. Gamer's CentralYou could create a Gamer's Central just like the one from Wreck-It Ralph. Then everyone can choose their card game and walk into an empty room.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Now I am a big poker fanatic and I like to play almost every weekend, but being able to play against almost real like players is great. I feel as if I am actually sitting down to play some Texas Hold'em when I play Poker Night 2. Not only that but the computer players always have something witty to say or may break into a conversation that makes me laugh. If you are a poker fanatic I would recommend this game 10/10. I really enjoy playing Poker Night 2 and I still look forward to playing it some more!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Perhaps one of the funniest games I ever played! I read about 6 great views at a site named after warrior women, and then was able to pick it up for about $2 I later bought the Tell Tale bundle and gifted this to a friend.  Back to the game.First you are entertained my playing poker. Then if you are a fan of the Venture Brothers, or the Evil Dead, or a couple of games I had heard of but never played, I discover I am playing with those characters! They even got the REAL VB bodyguard. even though I loose many hands its great entertainment and I leave with a smile!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												NEW REVIEWEver wanted to sit and play poker without having to have your poker face on? Have you ever wanted to rage while playing poker? Then get this game! It's so RIGGED, you'll sit there with the best cards and still get your sassy lil' behind handed to you on a silver platter!I suggest shaving your head before you start playing this game, that way you won't be pulling your hair out. I shaved my head clean before I bought this game and it's one of the best things I've ever done, otherwise by now I would have baldspots from yanking my own hair outta my head! #beardgamestrongWould shave my head clean again to avoid looking like sh!t/10OLD REVIEWGreat Poker game! Hilarious Characters from other games, with epic dialogue between the Characters! The jokes are on fleek lol. Characters are Claptrap, Glados, Brock Samson, Ash Williams and Sam (with Max) and Moxxi bringing in some drinks!Bonus for getting free untradeable items for Borderlands 2 and TF2. Oh sorry did you say something? Couldn't hear you over my cards sucking! This game is rigged AF! :DHEYOOO/10 would listen to Claptrap tell Steve to shut the ♥♥♥♥ up again!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Product received for free
												I missed the functionality of being able to skip the characters’ dialogues by clicking with the right button, which the first game had. After a while the dialogues start to become repetitive and it's really annoying having to listen to them over and over again. The bet-sliding bar is also less responsive than in the first game. But it's still a great game nonetheless, and thank God it doesn't have the luck-related achievements the first one had, which makes 100%'ing this one more doable. It does have an annoying achievement to reach a balance of one million dollars though, but it's easy to exploit: if you close the game as soon as you're about to lose and re-open it, your balance will never go down, making it possible to reach the milestone very easily.

												As with the first game, the player's enjoyment of Poker Night 2 will depend on how familiar they are with the characters. As a fan of Borderlands and Portal, I found Claptrap and Glados to be very funny. The other characters aren't important to me, so I found them quite dull, although Ash did make me laugh a couple of times with references to Bruce Campbell's Burn Notice character. There are plenty of unlockable items to give the game some longevity, but the downside is the characters don't have enough lines, so they repeat themselves often. There are two variations of Poker, Texas and Omaha, and a much better explanation of the rules than the first game, so poker novices won't be totally confused. I'm sure there are better poker games around, but considering the purchase price, I feel like I've got value for money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just finished getting all the achievements in this game, so I figured now is a good time to right a review. I have really enjoyed it this game and it was definitely worth the $1.24 I spent. This game got me into Poker (and then all my friends) and actually Sam/Max. The characters are humorous, and they each have a unique poker style and tells. I will say that some of the lines/conversations get played out quickly. I got one conversation b/w Claptrap and Ash 3 times in three hands. That said, thats by far the worst example, I just wish I could skip the banter that I've heard before. Also I have heard from others that if you like Evil Dead, the fact that Bruce Campbell didn't do Ash's voice is weird, but I wasn't a fan so I didn't think much of it. I recommend this game if you like these characters and want a poker sim. It was a good choice for me, especially at that price. 7/10 Hamdingers			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love the unique content that is unlockable in this game for Team Fortress 2, no other games around can do that. The dialogue is funny and witty, I still hear things I haven't before after twenty tournaments. This game would be even better with multi-player, let players select one of the normal NPCs to play then slim down the dialog set for each character. At least a good idea if a third installment is made to the series or if this game was ever updated. Even basic skipping abilities for normal dialogue would be great. It feels like it slows the games down after a few in a row. Plays fine at the native resolution on my Intel HD 3000 chipset meaning it can run on most laptops. Totally great game, a must own in for your Valve collection. 8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Play poker with your favorite dudes you've never seen before until now.Dog, Sassy robot, violent human, other violent human, and super super super annoying robot from borderlands.I want to kill him by throwing cards at his metal body until he suffers all kinds of cuts. I hate annoying robot. I also hate max from the first game.Naturally you can get things from each dude for your favorite tf2 mercs if you win. They improved the prize system in that you gotta complete certain missions, and those missions unlock the right to have someone put forth an item if they still have one.Its still just poker...or texas hold-em.You can get a skull hat for pyro, a knife for heavy, a mask for spy, boots for scout, and a cartoon dog hat.the banter from each person is amusing, but the sassy robot always wins.poke-I mean Texas hold 'em/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This, my friends, was a super fun game. It's actually currently a ""free"" offering on PSN as well. Wherever you play this though, you are in for a treat. You are the nameless, silent ""The Player"" and are playing against Brock Samson, Claptrap, Sam and Max, and Ash Williams. The dialogue is pretty witty and at times hilarious as the other players talk amongst themselves, have little jokes and jabs they throw your way, etc...the table is hosted by GLaDOS, who is also the dealer, and who interjects passive aggressive hostile jabs at all the players throughout the game. Actually, GLaDOS's dialogue is effective at representing the subtle menace for which it is known.There are a few options in the game that enhance the experience, most notably the ability to upgrade your chips, felt, and cards to the settings from all the other characters origin worlds/stories, which outside of changing the appearance of the room/table/et al, also unlockas new dialogue between the characters. You can also buy drinks for the other characters, delivered by your favorite bartender, Moxxi, in whose bar you are actually playing poker in. The drinks cause the other players to be more obvious in their tells.Speaking of tells, each of the players has them. Brock is a hothead and will often bet without a real hand. Ash plays more like Gus Hansen, Claptrap plays a solid game overall, and Sam almost always folds unless he has a real hand.That's pretty much it. Outside of the setting, dialogue, and some challenges which allow you to unlock new skins and such for Borderlands 2 and Team Fortress 2, it's pretty much a straightforward Hold 'em and Omaha game. So, if you like poker and video games, you will probably enjoy this. If not, look elsewhere for sure.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You can now give your opponent's drinks to make them easier to beat.2. Fun cameos.3. You can now earn Borderlands 2 items along with TF2 items.Cons:1. Items can be way too hard and tedious to get, thanks to some challenges.2. TF2 items are all boring cosmetics instead of a mix of reskin weapons, a badge and cool shades like in the orignal.Overall just as good as the orignal.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

PresentationPoker Night 2 follows a familiar pattern that you have probably seen or at least heard of before, and much like the original title Poker Night at the Inventory, it puts you, The Player against four other characters from different blockbuster franchises not only from the video game industry, but also from television series and movies, in tournaments of Texas Hold'em or Omaha Hold'em. This time around your adversaries are Sam from the Sam & Max franchise, Brock Samson from The Venture Bros, Ash Williams from The Evil Dead franchise, and Claptrap from the Borderlands series, in addition to GLaDOS from the Portal series which takes the role of the dealer. There isn't a story that unites those characters at the Inventory poker table, but having them in one place is great no matter the circumstances, and even though there is no adventure or story to follow here, hearing from them once again is just as nice. Even with the thought of the game being a simple poker simulator with your favourite characters as your adversaries in mind, the game does little to set itself apart from other such games apart from having those characters in it; there is only a short introduction cutscene when you start the game for the first time that shows you making your entrance at the Inventory for the first time and bumping into all those characters along the way as you move towards the table, and after that everything will become an endless repetition until you eventually get bored of the game. Even if you aren't familiar with some of the franchises that brought you those characters, they will make themselves known to you as you play more and more with them and hear their stories, but the really pleasure comes for those long-time fans of one of those characters, because hearing themselves explain one of their adventures that you are already familiar with in different way and in some ways making a parody of it is unlike nothing else.Rating: 7GameplayThere's no catch here, it's poker: you either dig it or you don't, but considering the amount of poker games out there, some of which come at no cost at all, looking at Poker Night 2's only 2 game modes and the lack of any sort of multiplayer you realize that if you got this game for the actual poker playing experience, you clearly got the wrong thing. Sure, Texas Hold'em and Omaha Hold'em are the most popular poker modes, but just like anything else it will get boring to follow the same road every tournament without any twist to change the actual game. Poker was always one of the most popular forms of gambling and even if virtual poker games still maintain that feeling by using virtual money and chips, it doesn't feel like gambling unless you play against other human players. Playing against the AI gets boring incredibly fast simply because their next move will always be predictable in a form or another, and even though the difficulty of the game is somewhere around what would be a normal level, you can't increase or decrease the difficulty to your liking if you're looking for a more intense experience or a more relaxed play. The only things that will change the boring atmosphere come in the form of unlockables, that once activated will change things like the deck of cards, the table or the chips and activating all three of them from the same theme will trigger a different scenery effect specific to that theme, making the Inventory look like the set of another Evil Dead movie or the next chamber of Portal experiments, but even so, those changes are strictly visual and will not affect the core idea of a repeating poker experience that is isolated to the AI battles only. Apart from the items that can be unlocked using tokens that you'll win at the end of each tournament according to what position you finished on and the ability to order drinks from the bar for your adversaries there is nothing else to distract you from what is an incredibly repetitive set of plays that is limited in every possible way.Rating: 5.5GraphicsPoker Night 2 isn't the prettiest game out there, even compared to other poker titles only, but it's not bad looking either; the characters are nicely done, the backgrounds are pretty and those unlockables really change the scenery in a pleasant way, especially when you combine all three of them from the same theme package. The animations are decent, even though the lip sync can be way off at times, but all the funky moves of those characters that combined with audio effects create some funny moments make up for it. Things don't look bad in any way, but you can clearly see some cubic edges when the camera zooms in on a character's face and so on.Rating: 6.5AudioThe cast, even though small, does its job of creating a rich audio environment as Sam is voiced by David Nowlin, Max by David Boat, Brock Samson by Patrick Warburton, Ash Williams by Danny Webber, Claptrap by David Eddings and GLaDOS by Ellen McLain. The one great thing about Poker Night 2 comes in the form of its epic dialogue between all those legendary characters that will constantly tell jokes and stories, all to the delight of the player. As good as those jokes are however, they won't last forever, and even thought the first hours of the game will be a pleasant surprise for the fans of those characters as you hear more and more stories about them, they will get repetitive eventually and when they do, that fun will almost instantly turn into boredom.Rating: 8ExtrasIf you're a fan of those characters or at least some of them, you'll have fun in the game for a few hours, but after you've heard everything there is to hear, which shouldn't take longer than 5 hours to do, your only motivation will come in the form of unlockables which in a worst case scenario will take around 10 hours to unlock all, and after that there really is no reason to come back: you'll hear the same old lines over and over again, there is nothing else to win or see and there are much better poker games out there available for free, which can also be played online.Rating: 4VerdictPoker Night 2 is a delight for those who appreciate the classics and wanna hear more about their favourite characters and this game is the perfect opportunity to see some of those legendary characters all in one place, but that special treatment will only last for a few hours, and once that is done and you've heard every joke those characters have in store for you, Poker Night 2 is just another game that you won't play ever again.Rating Overall: 6.2Check the full review and a lot more about Poker Night 2 at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=216 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Those are some high quality promo items.  Grand game.  ...But in all seriousness, Poker Night 2 is a very entertaining poker excursion.  Before this game, I had no idea how poker functioned.  Now, when...or if...if I ever participate in an actual poker tournament, I highly expect witty banter from interesting characters, nostalgic yet distinguished jazz-like music and fascinating themes. Either that or I will be instantly disqualified and forced out.  It's the perfect education tool, it teaches all the world about the joys of poker!  Such as buying alcoholic drinks to slowly but surely sabotage other fictional players or using a cheat sheet.  If any sentient being is still alive after reading that, then good, now I can accurately assess my opinion of the game.  Really, Poker Night 2 is a simple ""video game"" at the end of the day.  After all, it is what it is, poker.  What makes it so entertaining are the characters and their conversations with one another.  Poker Night 2's cast of characters is comprised of several fictional video games, animated television series, and even film characters.  Though these celebrities are hardly the most obscure of competitors, I admit that I had little idea of a few of them.  However, the way they interact with one another manages to crack a smile on my face.  The act of Brock Samson, the deadly assassin bodyguard from the Venture Bros. snigger at a profile of Sam, the bipedal dog detective from Sam & Max is a humorous conversation to listen to while looking at one's deck of cards.  Same with the adventurous Ash Williams and the slightly annoying yet semi-endearing CL4P-TP robot talk about his life story or attempt to put the moves on the dealer, a female A.I. by the name of GLaDOS and instantly be dismissed is nice to listen to.  ...The first few times.  While the charm of the conversations can last for quite some time, if one plays this game for hours on end, they will inevitably listen to the same dialogue line they heard sometime an hour or two before.  There unfortunately is only so much variety in one playthrough.Luckily, the game does not rely on characters chatting your ears off to keep you playing.  Not only are their incentives like the promotional items for Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2, but the soundtrack is a pleasure to groove to in one's seat.  Songs like ""Still Alive"" are reprised in a smooth jazz version to fit the calm, calm mood of having one's virtual wallet face the equivalent of being suctioned in by a vacuum. Of course, that seems like a hefty toll.  Fret not, for your ears do not have to take on the entire burden.  For your dear optic nerves, there are several card and chip themes for your playing pleasure that can be used to customize your tournaments.  You can combine card themes, chip themes, and table felt themes of your favorite franchise (as is represented) like Portal.  Unlock the themes and deploy them and watch as your poker table is immersed in an Aperture Science simulation.  Alternatively, employ a Borderlands 2 theme set and get the gritty, casino feel or the Sam & Max themes and unlock a black and white detective mystery movie-esque setting, originally meant for Sam & Max's 25th anniversary.  However, at the very end of the day, Poker Night 2 is just that, a poker game.  A poker game featuring the stars of video games, a television show, and a movie series.  I recommend it, not just for its incentives, but for its fascinating, entertaining themes and dialogue around the poker table.  ...And because those promo items are really good looking.

												Poker Night is mildly fun, but the AI is worse than the first. It's absurdly easy to bluff and bully, and it takes far too long to unlock things. The character dialogue is good but gets repetitive way too fast.  But most importantly the game, simple as it is, isn't really all that functional. The downloadable unlocks, which are the reason most people would give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about a game there are a thousand free varients of as it is, don't work most of the time. If you try to download Borderlands 2 items you have to write an email to Gearbox with a screenshot or you won't get them. To be honest, this game probably IS worth the money. But a company that leaves such a gaping flaw in their game unchecked deserves nothing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great design, fun time in poker... but filled with annoyances.All the characters talk too much! It's one thing to have some level of small talk by your favorite characters... I mean, that's why I bought the game! Initial raise gets you a reaction comment. If you all-in, you get 5+ gasp reactions from the group, even if they've folded previously, then they'll fold 80% of the time, then you'll get a 'player win' or 'player loss' razzing from GlaDOS and whomever won or lost. Also, Sam might be playing, but Max constantly interjects... and I hate those two from the first game. The dealer randomly tosses insults you as you are dealt cards, reraise, win or lose hands... and it's almost always Claptrap at the showdown, so anyone who hates him will hate him on a 1-on-1 level.The rewards system sucks! Original Poker Night would give you the 'reward' after you knocked out the one player w/ the item. This one has you complete 3 ""challenges"" to get a shot at a bounty, then you have to knock out all 4 players. One of the challenges is ""Spend 8 perfect tournament's worth of tokens to unlock the Portal set"" so those challenges aren't fluff either. There's no reset for them aside from deleting your save. Some folks on the Steam Forums say they have been stuck for over a year on same challenge. Even if you were magic, you'd have to do 10+ perfect games to get the unlocks... and they're time consuming! Until the blinds are 800/1600, these guys fold neatly on most raises like a pair of pleated pants. Oh, and despite having a SHiFT account and Borderlands 2 installed, none of the Borderlands stuff unlocked natively and I had to submit a SHiFT ticket with Gearbox. TF2 stuff unlocks W/O any hitches, as is the norm.The game looks pretty. I hate to badmouth it... but I bought the game because I liked the characters and wanted the unlocks. Spending a ton of hours to get the unlocks, when I'd rather be in B2 or TF2, and starting to hate the characters I liked before I started playing... honestly made me very unhappy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL:DR if you ever wanted to know what it felt like to play a rigged game of poker here's your chancePoker Night 2 lets you play poker against some recognizable characters and features Brock Samson from Venture Bros, Sam from Sam and Max, Claptrap from Borderlands and Ash Williams from Evil Dead. It also has Glados from Portal. I wanted to like this game. The idea is good, playing poker against these characters and listening to the funny conversations but the AI ♥♥♥♥s you over constantly. Good points:-the conversations between the characters are good and funny though they do end up looping the same stuff after a while-you can get items for Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2 Bad points:- the AI rigs the game against you. Get a good hand? Doesnt matter one of the AI players will beat you 9 times out of 10.   Get a two pair the AI gets a three of a kind. Get a flush the AI gets a straight flush. The longer I played the more evident it became.-Claptrap from Borderlands is just as annoying here as he is in the Borderlands game and is easily the worst of the featured characters.

It's still mostly just a $5 promotion with unlockable items for TF2 and Borderlands 2. The unlocks for those games are hardly worth the time because in TF2 almost everybody will have them in due time and people hardly play Borderlands 2 as often as they used to (even then nobody pays any attention at all to whatever their partners are wearing).In short: Whoop-de-freaking-doo			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The game also has a bug in which the best hand you have isn't played, and I lose because of it. For instance, I'll have a full house in my hand, and the game autoselects only the three of a kind to use, while an opponent has a straight.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Only get this game if you want the items that come with it. The Borderlands 2♥♥♥♥♥♥is neglectable so you should only want it for TF2 items.Why is this game not the poker you game you should be buying? The cutscenes. They are annoying after a few games and you can not skip them. You might be able to turn them off (Haven't checked) but that would kill everything besides the poker element. Don't get me wrong, it would be a great game but everything feels clunky and the menu is horrible. To switch 2 pages in the menu you take about 8-10 seconds. Dreading, not majorly long, but still dreading.It has some fun features, decks / felts / chips can be customized to different sets that belong to the characters that sit at your table.In the end, if this game wasn't feeling so clunky. Had a skip button and slow overall I would recommend this to everyone. Because the poker is just poker. And that's mostly what you want from a poker game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Middle of the road game, to be honest. The game was a ton of fun for the first few hours, but between Claptrap being completely annoying and Max just being a d**k, it almost made the items not worth it. I thoroughly enjoyed the unlocks, but I nearly went insane having to constantly place insane bets to get even minor pots. If you want a few cool items for Borderlands and TF2, go ahead, you'll probably like them. But if you're new to poker, this game is a cheating motherf**ker that will CONSTANTLY go out of its way to give you absolute Hell. Got a three of a kind? Too bad, you only have a high card. Have a royal flush? Sorry, we're just going to count it as a normal straight. I recomend picking it up while it's cheap, get the items, and either keep it for some themed poker or refund it. I highly recomend the original, even if almost all of its unlocks were merely reskins.BTW, why in the Hell are Brock and Ash here? Brock's entertaining, sure, but the theme of this series is gaming/gaming related media. While Evil Dead at least had a game series, Brock's inclusion is just confusing. I personally would have tried for getting the rights to Phoenix Wright, as Phoenix is a small time poker series in the canon of his games, but then again, Capcom doesn't have the best track record when it comes to multi-corperation co-operation.
