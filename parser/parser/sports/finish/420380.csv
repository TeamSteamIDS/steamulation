												This is a re-release from a 2009 game. The graphics may suck, but the gameplay is pretty simple and is pretty fun as far as fishing games go.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a great game!  I think this is among the best fishing games of all time.  In fact, I'm now on a journey to play every single fishing game after I played this.  This really holds up.  I declare it the second best fishing game on Steam.  If you want something that is really cutting-edge, play Dovetail Games' Euro Fishing.  But if you wanted something a little bit more arcade-y and has that almost-10-years-old retro feel, pick this up for sure.

			What a great fishing game! I had a lot of fun and will definitely be playing this a lot. Not exactly a new game though, so the graphics are a bit dated but the controller support is SPOT on.		

It is unfortunate that the resolution is low.  The aspect ratio is only 4:3.  But this game works and it's really fun.  One thing I have no doubt you will be impressed by is the Xbox 360 controller support.  In my opinion it's one of the most important aspects of any game, but on an old port it makes it playable right out of the box.  If you saw a 1989 flight simulator on Steam would you complain that it is old, or would you be happy it is available?  This game is from 2009.  That was awhile ago.  Maybe someday they will revisit this franchise.This is one of those fishing games where you can change your viewing angle so that you can see your lure in the water or you can view your perspective from the boat.  Not a lot of games allow you to control the lure in the water like this...  It's not a very simulator-y type of feel but it's fun.  In many fishing games that I played, the fish models are really ordinary and boring looking but in this game they look very cool!  Almost cartoonish.  And even the animation when the fish goes to bite on the lure is very exciting.MUST OWN if you are a fishing fan that can tolerate a lower video resolution.			",4125,1558,197,486,660,69,658

												wish there were more 3d fishing games with the underwater camera like this available in this generation of pc games. Has a bit of that rapala pro fishing feel to it although the quality isn't as good. Need more games like this or Rapala Pro fishing with updated graphics/sound. The sound quality is really poor in this game and irritates me which is the biggest reason why i don't play it very often. The graphics might be ok if the game was released earlier than 2005 but for a game that came out in 2009, it's really lacking. tbh this game belongs in an arcade setting, there's no skill in the game, no real thinking required, the fish don't really move around or change locations, the fish either love the lure or they don't, you either go to an area marked as having fish or look for a fishy spot that isn't marked and has none. This game basically tells you where the fish are and it's incredibly easy to pick out a lure the fish will bite on. Nothing like rapala pro fishing where the fish could either bite like crazy or be incredibly finnicky depending on your lure and presentation. Getting fish to the boat is really no challenge in this game you just face the boat in such a way that the fish is trapped and can't run and empty the reel, then you just wait for it to tire out and reel it in. Rapala Pro fishing you could kind of do a similar thing but you ran the risk of the fish finding a snag on the bank, which would happen 90% of the time if you let it have it's way in a little cove. It's a fishing game offers more than fishing a flat image on a screen, but it's quality is lacking. Still a better game than fishing planet as of June 2016 though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
