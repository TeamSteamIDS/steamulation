YouTube™ Video: OlliOlli 2 - First Impressions 

			Views: 2,638		

			These are my first impressions of OlliOlli 2 for PC This is not intended to be a considered review. That being said it's an excellent game and you should probably buy it :) I will update this video...		

It's a great little indie game with a ton of replay value. It's an excellent example of easy to learn difficult to master. Must buy!Pros:+ Replay Value+ Mechanical Depth+ Soundtrack+ Artstyle + Online LeaderboardsCons: + PC Options Menu+ Controller Required			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its like Tony Hawk Pro Skater, Skate and Super Meat Boy had a threesome, its amazing.Took me a while to get use to the controls, and I'm still messing up every so often, but once you get use to it, it feels pretty damn good. Pulling off huge combos is very satisfyingSound effects, visuals and music are great. Although I think I'll throw in some super meat boy hell dark world to really get the blood flowing.

												i have played olliolli 2 before on the ps4. so i know what i am getting. but so happy its on WIN/MAC/LINUX.handles great, tight controls and the gameplay is stepped up a notch because manuals/reverts are in. so combos are huge.the soundtrack is brilliant. great and well chosen music, perfect for olliolli.a perfectly balanced game, that really does make you wonder if your gamepad will last the night from retry after retry to get the highest scoresone thing i can say on a bad note is that the optimisation seems to be a bit slow. unlike olliolli 1 which was stupidly fast, there seems be some slow down here. it may be because of the port [because it feels like one, if not fair enough]. but i will leave that up to updates in future and hope it gets addressed.all in all, a great product, sequel and tons of fun. well worth it. you should buy itrating: solid-*UPDATED ADDITION REGARDING SLOW DOWN*-i did actually turn down the resolution in video settings, and that has really made a difference to what it should be like. so maybe try that if slow down is a problem******			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awesome skateboarding game that is a nice challenge, has good controls and will keep you laughing. I was a big fan of the SKATE series and this is pretty much a 2d/indie version of SKATE. If you want gameplay that is a nice challenge, enjoy skateboarding or just want an overall fun game give this one a try! You will be doing all kinds of crazy tricks for hours on end. The maps are very well designed levels and the game is quite addicting!This game will keep you coming back for more and more trying to beat hard levels and trying to improve scores. The game also has been running well to, no crashes, no fps issues, no gamebreaking bugs,etc.. Olli! Olli! Olli! Olli!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a really fun game, it looks and sounds great, and the new mechanics are fun.But there are some bugs that I ran into the day that it launched 4 months ago, here's a link to the steam discussion:http://steamcommunity.com/app/365660/discussions/0/535152511382137328/If you prefer to use a keyboard they most likely will ruin your run at some point.I still like the game but buying anything with permanent bugs is never fun. The multiplayer also leaves a lot to be desired.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First thing first, I loooved the first OlliOlli, so no need to say that I had high expectations for this one.Well I havent been disapointed at all. Roll7 managed to improve a game that was already brillant.Gameplay is tight, and quite punishing (especially on RAD mode), but incredibly rewarding once you master it :)Easy to handle, hard to master (MASTER). Add some nice graphics and great soundtrack on top of that, and you'll have a must-play game that I would recommend with no hesitations.And yeah, I beat that **** RAD mode :D !!!Well done Roll7 !

												As a fan of the first game I like OlliOlli 2: We Had Funds For An Actual Artist This Time Edition just the same. The team managed to keep the great controls and add some new stuff like manuals and perfect launchers, minor changes for some but I'll take it in the year when Activision finally killed Tony Hawk's franchise with a complete turd.Kinda wish the game had a controller vibration toggle and didn't promote the xbone controller that much though (there are no bindings for the standard 360, Microsoft promotional funds perhaps?) .

												Smooth beats, sick moves.OlliOlli was the best endless runner/rock hard skateboard move combo game I'd played in months. Well, the best just got better!Why's it better? Polish, nollies, the aforementioned beats and some added smoothing.Rad.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
