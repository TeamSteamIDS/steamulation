												This game is far from finished.  Total lack of voice overs and possibly less content.  Sure, hitting the other guy in the face is entertaining, but it's ever so buggy.  No body shots, no blocking properly with gloves, and zero sense of any progression.  Heck, even the fighters are more or less unnamed joes that you just beat up.  The gym has 2 bags that you can punch around.  Gets old quick.  Maybe put a few mini games in there??  How many times in 60 seconds you could hit the speed bag?  Try to hit the ceiling with the heavy bag?  I dunno.  Something to spice up the gym a little.For the price, I'm not too bummed out, but I still think there should have been a bit more to this before releasing.  If this had a bit more of a story to it, allowed body shots,  gave some sort of sense of progression and had a few bugs ironed out, then I would probably rate this very well.  Until then, I'm afraid I must give it a thumbs down.This bug below is so bad, it's impossible to lose a fight since they can't hit you:

												I really don't get it why so many of these VR experiences / games get so many positive reviews compared to the amount of negative reviews. Yea I get it, VR is cool. Most of these games just really seem like a less than a gamejam amount of time and less effort on a video game. Don't say that the games are good if the tech is good/cool.Atleast this was priced accordingly, so I wouldn't bash it too much, but also wouldn't expect nothing from it. Boxing itself was fun, it was like a tech demo for Wiimotes. Everything else in this game wasn't enough to slide under the average quality of VR games and its pretty sad since the bar seems pretty low.			",373,69,16,38,44,7,47

												The game is so unfinished that I was amazed that this is not an early access game. You can only punch your opponent in the face and.. You basically just have to wiggle your arms (controllers) really fast in front of your opponents face, and you will knock him down in about 5 seconds from the start, every time!! I've tried with many opponents and the end result is always the same.Another crazy detail is that you have to wait 15 seconds every time before the round begins. It is not a big deal, but when you do this over and over again in every round, it really starts to eat away your motivation to play the 5 seconds that the round will last..Great idea, but that is all there is.

												Graphicly this game is ok. But gameplay wise the thrill of the fight blows it out of the water!! during matches i try bodyshots and blocking bc i'm used to it but it just doesn't work. the guy punches through your hands wtf. you hit him twice he goes down. that's no fun at all. The gym looks nice but for that reason alone i can't recommend this game.			",69,32,6,2,21,5,0

												Hello, EveryoneI thought this game was pretty fun and got a pretty good workout in it. I Box in real life and it was fairly realistic, as must as a VR Boxing game can be. I do wish they would let you hit the body, I like hitting the body a lot but I cant in this game.If you like check out my Video Gameplay Here:

												Lots of potential here! Physics feel good. Body shots need to register but head shots, punching bag, heavy bag all feel great. A.I. is way too easy but its early. Make it more difficult, change up the opponents looks. Maybe add some slow mo replays in addition to the previous suggestions and I think this game rocks and is worth much more!
