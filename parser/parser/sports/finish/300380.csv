								Buy this game if ya grew up playing Road Rash, ya will not be disappointed.The main reason for this review is not, in fact, to rave about this great game, but to rave about the amazing customer support from the developers. I've been dealing with a lot of ""big"" companies' customer support, and getting terrible customer support (including having my requests shut down with no communication - thanks, Sony). So when I emailed the developers of Road Redemption regarding issues around a 32 bit win7 4GB machine, not only was I highly surprised to see a responce within 4 hours (give or take 20 minues) but having an actually answer (in this case, I was informed that the issue had been noticed and the game would be patched in a few hours).  In one contact, the developers not only smashed my expections, I now use them as an example of a company doing it right. So, developers, please please please, keep up the great work.

								23 Hours, 100%My experience with Road Redemption:My game crashed plenty of times.My game crashed on the final turn of the final level.I repeatedly got my ♥♥♥ kicked.I got kicked off of bridges and into oncoming traffic.I didn't get to swing a chain I fell between buildings and off of rooftops multiple times.I got stuck on car bumpers.I emptied entire clips into the sky trying to aim.I got the Rainbow Road song stuck in my head at work.I couldn't adjust the difficulty settings.I was launched into the air by highway grenades over and over.I was challenged.I maxed out my character.I kicked just as much♥♥♥♥♥as was previously kicked upon me. And then some.... and I loved all 1380 minutes of it.Every crash report I sent, I received a response from the developer Ian with his phone number attached within the hour. Even at 5am.Anyone who says these guys don't care about their game, don't update the game or have abandoned the game couldn't be further from the truth.This game and this Dev team is a testament to how Early Access should be done. LONG LIVE THESE DEVS			",356,90,22,30,73,6,47

								SMASHING!Ekhm... ok, so it's closest thing to Road Rash for now - but IT'S NOT ROAD RASH - keep that in mind. It's worth it, but i would wait for final release, you might be a little dissapointed right now. Pros:- It's closest thing to Road Rash avaible.- Lots od nice weapons. SMASHING!- Daily updates.- Nice Skill Tree.- Idea itself?Cons:- It doesn't feels like i'm driving motorcycle for some reason.- Sounds feels like i'm playing game from 90's.- Grindy.- Weird physics?- Lack of customization.- No multiplayer yet.- Only 5 motorcycles for now.So yeah... better just wait few months till it will be a little more polished and with multiplayer(i REALLY hope).

								""Road Rash"" is back and better than ever thanks to Road Redemption!Well I have to say that this game has been so much fun, I just completed the early access version of the game, and I must say that I am thoroughly impressed.I like to keep things simple, so I will give you a list of things I liked and disliked from this title!Things I enjoyed from Road Redemption: Great controls! (Game handles pretty well, keeping that balance between realism and fun.) Action Packed (Game keeps players on their toes, with funny wipeouts in the mix of things.) Lots of Weapons (Tons of things to fight with, including guns, which Road Rash never had.) Upgrades and Perks (They work wonderfully and really help the player through the race.) Different Environments (They change as your progress.) A Secret Map (Are you guys kidding me... Freaking Rainbow Road from Mario Kart?!?!YES!) Things I feel need some work: Optimization (The maps can become very very laggy with frames dropping to around 5 FPS, I have a pretty beefy rig with a Radeon 7970 and it shouldn't have problems with a game like this.) Voice Overs ( I really wish there was some kind of voices for the police and riders, not really dialoge, more like ""Oofs"" or laughter and maybe a ""Pull over!"" from some cops now and then.) Character Customization (There really isn't any, but this is early access and I have a feeling this could change easily.)Overall this game is really fun and takes me back to the good 'ol PSX days sitting around my house, playing Co-op smacking my father with a chain in Road Rash Jailbreak.

Early Access Review
								One caveat before I start.  This game is still unfinished.  There are really only three tracks, and half of a campaign to play through as of my last playthrough.With that out of the way, this is pretty much the absolutely insane Road Rash successor that I didn't know I wanted.The main campaign mode (the only thing implmented in the version I've played) is semi randomly generated (meaning that you'll get random victory conditions on the tracks), and has rogue like elements like permadeath and an ability to buy stats with the money you collected during a run.  The campaign, so far as I can tell, still follows a basic track structure.  It goes desert tracks for a few races, rooftop tracks (which is where most of the glitches seem to currently reside), winter track (which is basically a greyier version of the desert track), and quite literally Rainbow Road from Mario Kart.  What really makes these tracks dynamic is the random effects you can get.  Like all oncoming traffic, weather effects, or even raining and explosive cars.  Some of these effects are amazing, and really push the races from fun but basic to absolutely crazy.The actual bike handling is pretty forgiving, if a little stiff.  It's pretty easy to stay on the track, barring some occasional blind turns.  I do kinda wish there was more tactile feel to the handling, since it really doesn't feel like you are even on a bike.  But in the context of the game it isn't so bad.  Because it works well with the game's combat system.Which is the meat and potatoes of this game.  It is amazingly satisfying to club someone over the head with a pipe.  Most of my time in the campaign mode was chasing down and braining rival racers.  The more racers you take out, the more money and better weapons you are granted, thus continuing the cycle of violence.  The gun play seemed okay, but I honestly didnt try it much, since I really just wanted to beat more racers (and police, and random traffic) with melee objects.Of the games three basic tracks, the desert/winter ones are the best realized.  The rooftop tracks I had issues falling out of the level geometry and getting stuck.  And the Rainbow Road alike track makes for an interesting easter egg, but wasn't much fun to race on, with constant tight turns and narrow track width, and no traffic to interact with.  But these are things I'd assume would be smoothed out over time.Overall, thus far there's not a wealth of features in the game, but what is there is quite fun.  The combat is fun enough that I found myself slowing down just to hit more racers with blunt objects.  And doing so while cars are dropping from the sky and exploding is quite amazing.  I'd recommend it once it becomes a more complete product.  Even now it's pretty fun, but the glitches and lack of content mar it currently.  If a totally crazy and still very playable bike combat game sounds up your alley though, I'd go ahead and recommend it now.			",357,50,11,33,26,2,27

If you love Road Rash you should buy the gamePros :- Loads of weapon from ordinary bat (with achievement called batman?).... to Uzi and C4 explosive.- Good graphic- Good challenge, you could get killed by car or other gang member, your choice- THE RAINBOW ROADPro/Con (?):- Freaking permanent death made you lose all your store payment, but you got XP to upgrade your skill which is niceCons :- System requirements- No bike selection- Music. Come on, the game is about illegal motorcycle racing. Why'd you got chiptune as music?8/10			",443,88,14,71,72,2,70

								NOSTALGIA GLASSES ACTIVATED: ROAD RASH RESURRECTIONThat's what every review here will say and it's definitely similar. There are some sensibilities to keep in mind, however. Road Redemption is a lot more modern in its arcade style. Controls are more lenient, though racing does have some weight. In turn, physics are crazy over the top for extra excitement from jumps and debris flying across the road. Combat packs a punch with lots of different weapon choices, though firearms suffer from poor camera control right now. Leveling options are available with random missions, in a roguelike play-by-play setting with additional playthrough enhancement possibilities.

								This game is basically Road Rash , the game , not a rash while you got on a road.. nvm. I would rather say what this game has and what it needs since it is still in early access rather than Pros and Cons.Game Has -Complete nostalgia , made me feel like a 10yr version of me , when i used to play this game in summer vacations wearing nothing but shorts and eating chips.Good Driving and simple controls.A decent campign and good amount of quick raceYou can fire ak-47 while riding a bike and also c4Really Fun From The minute you will launch itThe Ability to bring a big Smile On Your Face.Game Needs -Better Soundtracks while racing rather than just an electric guitar being played , (Miss The Rusty Cage song and Mirror in your Eyes song)Better Sound effects , When ever you Kill a biker , the sound effect is like you collected a mushroom in Mario.Bring back The Voice dialogues or qoutes everytime someone kills.Bike Customization, some vinlys or colors perhaps ?A bigger size of campaign.( Thought havent completed mine , because once You Die you have to start all over again )Bigger races , races are really short ( Like the one Napa valley 29.9 miles ? )Definetly Multiplayer ( Game would be dead in 12hrs if it doesnt have multiplayer)Won't Be Fair To give this game a rating out of 10 since it is not completed still . But Devs You are on the right path , So goodluck :)    ( Eagerly waiting for this game to get completed )			",62,22,4,0,4,0,1

								Do you remember the 90's? There was this gem of a title called Road Rash that was just about the coolest thing anyone had seen at the time. Road Redemption takes the spirit of that old classic, slaps some more meat on the bones, and brings it into the modern gaming scene, with it's own original twists.Road Redemption is a straight arcade game. Don't go looking for a ""racing"" game here so much. The emphasis is much less about getting to the finish line first, and more about making sure nobody else does. And that's where it shines. Road Redemption doesn't try to be anything it's not. It knows it's a fun, quirky arcade racing rampage. That's all it wants to be.The graphics are not amazing, but not bad. The sound is a bit rought, but the music is good.Currently the game is not without it's faults, there's some performance issues, sound effects could REALLY use their own volume slider (they can get insanely loud at times), the camera control while shooting is a bit hard to use, and the menus and such are pretty minimalist.At it's core though, the game is just crazy fun. You'll find yourself playing it over and over, even after telling yourself ""Just one more time..."".The plans they have for adding multiplayer and stuff in the future only add even more to look forward.I do love seeing the collaborations with other indie devs too. (Shovel Knight starting with a shovel FTW!)All in all, for a fun, crazy good time that mimics the joy of old school fun times, Road Redemption is totally worth the asking price.

Early Access Review
								The following is based on 5 hours play of the Early Access version, which I hope will provide some useful non-partisan feedback to the developers.1) This is not a racing gameRacing games tend to have some things in common. They have tracks, they have timers, they have scores, they have course records, they have winners and losers, they challenge the player to improve, and they instil a sense of progression and achievement. Road Redemption has and does none of these things.Road Redemption neither rewards success nor frowns upon failure. You simply must not die, or else you’re back to square one. Take a “race” event, for example. To win any money you must finish in the top three. However the sorts of thing you can spend your money on post-race are health top-ups, nitro-replacements and other items that ameliorate the damage of the previous race. Given that the aim is simply not to die, it behoves the player not to actually take part in the race. I, for example, employ a half-throttle strategy, simply puttering around at half-throttle avoiding obstacles, combat and various other hazards in order to get to the end with as little damage as possible. More often than not this strategy leads to a top three finish, but it doesn’t matter anyway because you can still progress to the next event regardless of where you finish. I’ll say it again: there is no benefit to taking part in the race because the aim is not to die.What of the other events, such as Take Down, Jump Jets, and Police Attention? The same applies. Your priority is not to die and “failure” doesn’t hinder your progress. So should you a) participate and risk death for no benefit or, b) pull off to the side of the track and do something else for three minutes? If you answered “b” you’re beginning to see the problem with Road Redemption.        2) The tracks need a designerRoad Redemption’s ‘road’ courses are dull and boring. They largely consist of four and six lane highways, long, sweeping, shallow corners and some of the dullest designs I’ve ever seen. If you were hoping to experience the thrill of opening the throttle into a blind corner on to oncoming traffic, darting between cars and trucks as your heart starts beating that bit quicker, Road Redemption will leave you disappointed.The roof-top courses are simply dreadful and need to go. If I want to race in a city I want to do it at ground level. I want to blast down alleys, race through shopping malls, crash into curiously placed fruit stalls. What I don’t want is to race on roofs crashing into air-conditioning units. Nor do I want to fall off the side of a building and for the game to reposition me somewhere in mid-air leading to an inescapable death cycle, which seems to happen rather more often than it ought.Don’t get me started on Rainbow Road. This is out of place and even the game doesn’t seem to understand it. I’ve “fallen” off this track to have the game reposition me after the finish line - the bike indicator jumped from the progress meter to the right hand side of the screen and I could not finish the race. I’d also say this: if you want to do something a bit self-referential or add a knowing wink to a game, pick something from your own history like a 16-bit Road Rash level. Don’t pluck something out of a completely different series like Mario Kart.      3) Procedures are for bureaucratsHad I been careful enough to read that Road Redemption uses a lot of “procedural generation” beforehand I almost certainly would not have bought it. Why?a) Because infinitely generated dullness is infinitely dull and,b) Because developers never give you the option to replay the same procedurally generated level.There’s nothing wrong with adding a bit of randomness to a game - games like the Burnout series have been doing this successfully for years - but when everything is random and there’s no mechanism to replay a “procedurally” generated course then there is no sense of progression or achievement.Imagine that you’d actually bothered engaging with the game (which you won’t, see 1 above) and you’d come first in a race. Imagine further that you’d had so much fun, you thought you’d like to play the exact same level again. What if you then wanted to share that level with friends for a bit of friendly competition? What if you’d like to have a play with the parameters sent into the procedures to see what sort of madness you could generate - or better yet have the control to create and share your own courses? Well tough. You can’t. This strikes me as a massive oversight and one that should be easily fixable, but strangely never seems to occur to developers.      4) It’s not about the bikesCall me a traditionalist but I expect a bike game to have a good range of bikes, all with unique handling and performance characteristics. I want a bike shop so I can ogle over the Diablo 1000, I want an upgrade shop so I can fit nuclear-powered rocket-motors to my bike. I want to indulge my virtual-bike fantasies.Road Redemption doesn’t give you any of this. Instead you get a skill tree (of which more later) and jump jets.5) Moral hazard?You might think that bike-based combat would be an almost infinite source of fun, but in truth it gets old very quickly. I played through the original Road Rash recently and found the combat there to be far superior even though it was far more limited. Why?It’s all to do with focus. Road Rash is a racing game where limited violence can be deployed to your advantage (and often chagrin when it goes wrong). Road Redemption is a non-racing game where egregious violence is used all the time for no specific purpose other than you can. Road Rash also introduced consequences for being violent (albeit in a limited way - Natasha being rude to you wasn’t the end of the world), whereas Road Redemption’s violence is entirely consequence free.You can have all the guns, clubs, bombs and swords you want but if they only exist for the sake of existing what’s the point?PS Swinging from helicopters sounds like it should be fun, but isn’t. 6) Do you wanna be in my gang?Another thing the original Road Rash got right was its personality and connection to the game world. There are other characters who converse (yes, in a limited way) with you and draw you into the  world of illegal street racing.Road Redemption, on the other hand, is completely impersonal. You are apparently a member of some bike gang (of which the only evidence is the occasional appearance of a rider with a green arrow pointing to him), battling other gangs (who are they, why are we fighting?) in some strange dystopian world of which you - the player - have little knowledge of and probably care even less about.  7) Skill me up, Scotty!If there is a golden rule to racing games it’s that the player’s skill comes first and foremost. If the player enters a corner too fast and ends up embedded in a wall that is his or her problem; conversely if a player executes the perfect jump, squeezes between two oncoming vehicles and wins by the narrowest of narrow margins that is the player’s reward. It’s fine to add some variability - such as tires bursting, engines blowing etc. etc. - but it should, essentially, be all about the player.Road Redemption’s skill system flies in the face of this. The player’s actual skill is replaced by a tree of variables (or “skills”) that affect the outcome, turning the game into a grind rather than focusing on improving and rewarding the player’s real skill (or would do if the player engaged with the game: see 1, above).   8) Control, oh pitiful controlI found the game almost impossible with mouse and keyboard. Imagine piloting a brick at 100mph. That’s Road Redemption with a mouse and keyboard. A controller is infinitely better - as long as you don’t try using any of the ranged weapons.

								Have you ever played any other racing games and you feel like you want to kill your adversaries? ... Well, you can do it here !First of all i have to say that if you have seen Mad Max movies or played Road Rash before, you will feel like home.Road Redemption is an Indie / Racing game that is in Early Access that has simple objectives like other racing games, beat your opponents getting first place and cross the finish line. So what does it makes it different ?You can use much kinds of melee / fire weapons, since a crowbar up to a medieval axe or since a revolver up to an AK47.Get a awesome trip across USA on twisted high roads, gaining money and reputation to buy new upgrades.Although this game still on Early Access looks quite interesting, it has a lot of potential, resuming that, these are the main points of the game:Pros:- Insane but totally funny combat system.- Good amount of weapons.- Challenging levels (each time that you're completing missions the difficult will increase).- We have 3 different level modes:* Race: Beat your enemies and get 1st place to get all money and experience.* Hunt: The objective is kill the other racers (this is an easy mode).* Hallucinogen Chemical Zone: Same as normal race, the different thing here is that cars will rain from the sky (that makes this game mode quite hard).- A lot of different enemies, since a normal racers up to a big badass truck.- Increase of difficult (as this game doesn't has difficult, each time that you anvance a level the difficult will increase and makes this game more challenging).Cons:- At the moment this game doesn't has multiplayer (that will make it more interesting).- Some random frame drops.- Limited amount of characters and vehicles.- No vehicle customization.As i said before this game has a lot of potential, atm i'm in love with it.10 / 10If you found this review helpful you can find out more at our Completing the Backlog's Curator page.

								Road Rash 3D?This game reminds me so much of the Road Rash series especially Road Rash 3D. I used to love playing those games back in the days. ^ ^Here you race against other motorcyclists, punching, kicking, grabbing, using melee weapons and firearms to attack or slow down their progress.Each race has a different requirement and mission. One might have you to simply get 1st place, another will have you cause enough chaos to get the attention of the cops or another mission may ask you to smash every motorcyclist and vehicle you see.Successfully pulling off completed missions will earn you a lot of money and XP, and the more motorcyclists, cops and vehicles you take out the more XP and money you earn.After each race you can use the money to buy different boosts and buffs. You keep them as long as you stay alive, but if you die they are all gone but after death you can use the XP you have earned for permanent upgrades like a better motorcycle, increased health, better weapons, increased weapon durability and a whole lot more.This is an early access game so you will see some bugs throughout, like being able to drive through bridge columns with no collision detection or sometimes the camera will rotate on its own in another direction which can lead to crashes because you are trying to fix the camera position and there is no camera reset button or key so you have to manually move the camera back behind the driiver and try to get it as centered as possible so your driving isn't off. But this is something that can easily be fixed in an update.So far Road Redemption looks really good and has a lot of promise and if you are a fan of the Road Rash series then you will really enjoy this game. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								There's no Road Rash to be had here.I got really excited by this game at first, had some fun with it at first, but then I saw that this wasn't going anywhere.Got this game like 2 years ago or around that time. Well, it's almost 2017. It sucks hard, and there's nothing ""Road Rash"" about it. Music, style, it just lacks everything that made Road Rash good.There's been many updates since then, but it really added nothing, and the entire game feels like a mobile game. Just lifeless in everything, the stages, the bikes (and bikers), even the menu theme is just some soft piano crap which doesn't fit the game at all. It's also missing the punk biker gang feel that the original had, which to me was pretty important in making Road Rash, well, Road Rash.The bikes feel like they are on rails, and not the uncontrollable screaming banshee like they were in the original Road Rash that made you fight for your life. Hitting other bikers feel really unsatisfying as well.Don't get me wrong, it doesn't need to be a complete copy of Road Rash. I can accept that just fine, but this game is utterly lifeless. It lacks soul.It just so happens to be a game where you can only ride bikes and can hit other bikers. The similarities literally end there. Look at every other review here, it's always ""not quite Road Rash just yet"", or ""it's getting there, just a bit more!"". Yeah, that's what I thought as well, and look at it now.If you want a game that didn't forget its own roots, get Carmageddon Max Damage. It's quite faithful to the original (they at least tried if you don't agree with me). At least that game got out of early access, and even if you don't like it, it's the better game by far.Review update #1:Apparently there's no longer any piano crap playing in the menus, just heavy metal. Is it a small step for... something?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Road Redemption was a game that, when it came out, quickly became one of my favourites. The gameplay was exceptionally fun, mixing combat and racing decently well. The mechanics felt a bit clunky, but it was still playable. It was the only game on the market that allowed you to fly around with a jetpack on your bike while propelling yourself forward with a grappling hook, so I could live with a few glitches.I've only recently returned to this game, and I'm still having fun with the game. However, and there are a few things that have changed I'm curious about:Why is there limited jetpack fuel?Realistically, it makes sense that you only have a set-amount of jetpack usage. However, in a game where you can swing a battleaxe on a motorcycle, drive on Rainbow Road, and certain stages are labelled, ""Hallucinogenic Chemical Zone"" where cars fall from the sky, I wouldn't think realism was in DarkSea Games' list of things they wanted this game to be.Why don't I have infinite grappling hooks?Exact same point as above. I mean, my favourite part about old Road Redemption was that once you got the jetpack and grappling hook, the game became a psuedo flight-sim game, where you had to propel yourself back onto the road with the hooks. If you got the hang of it, you became a god among men. Still, despite my complaint, I can still recommend the game. It's still highly enjoyable, and if Road Redemption's Wikipedia page can be trusted, we'll see a full-length game release in September of this year.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								As a kid growing up I spent so many hours playing Road Rash on the Mega Drive. After hearing of this nostalgic remake I had to check it out.What I like about the game:+ Fast paced. No boring bits here folks.+ Action can get intense, especially when you are paying attention to the road hazards as well.+ Tons of weapons to weild.+ Riding physics are pleasant with a nice ""arcade"" feel.+ Plenty of ways of dispatching your foes into the asphalt, speeding cars, poles, concrete etc.+ Runs smooth on older hardware (circa 2005) and is rock stable.What I don't like:- Rooftop & Space levels are disjointed from the fast flow of the other levels.- Rooftop levels have minor bugs that cause your cycle to crash.- Seems to be an unnecessary mid-air slow down effect off ramps and jumps.- Some textures are low-res and are reminiscent of late '90's Direct3D games.- A few of the music tracks are out of place.What I'd like to see:= The textures pumped up to decent resolutions.= Music tracks that fit the grunge / metal theme of this game.= Speedometer.= Crashed bikes become obstacles. Just to create some jeopardy for firearms lovers.= More bikes + riders to select.= Upgradeable bike parts from tyres to turbos to keep the game interesting.= Less ""catch up"" handicap.These are small negatives on a massively fun game. I might sound a little harsh on a game that isn't finished, however I feel that the game and it's current content just need a minor nudge in the right direction before it gets polished so that it will be the killer game experience it deserves.

								This is the modern remake of Road Rash that everyone has been waiting for, it is still lacking  Single Player content, but seeing as it is still in  Early Access  it will be expanded upon soon enough.There is however still enough content here to make it worth buying now, there's already a campaign mode (albeit short) and campaign+ mode, and a big variety of weapons available (rocket launcher, c4, shotgun, samurai sword, to name but a few) , you can also upgrade your perks (for want of a better word) using the XP gained after each campaign playthrough (giving you that little bit of a better headstart the next time round). This is an extremely gratifying game to play as a bit of mindless racing fun, which will only become more so, once more content is added.Recommended			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game was hugely disappointing. Why is it so difficult for developers to replicate Road Rash? Every reboot, remake, reimagining, homage, always focuses on the fighting. Fighting in Road Rash was a novelty but not what made the game special. It was the racing. The twisting turns, the trecherous roadways; it was the rush when you threaded the needle at top speed on the 15th mile of Pacific highway. The key to success was racing clean or a kick to your opponent at an opportune time, because getting into a slugfest slowed you down and cost you the race. It was as much you against the level as it was you against your opponents. There was a vibe, an edge, and one hell of a soundtrack.Road Redemption has none of these things. It is bland and devoid of character. It focuses too much on weapons and damaging your opponents and not enough on racing or level design. The core gameplay mechanic, how you navigate through the game, is also flawed. Rather than a hub where you can select races or make a name for yourself on some underground circuit, you are forced to progress through a series of ""levels"". Each level has an objective, win the race, take out x number of oppontents, use this special move, etc. The kicker: when you die, you start back at the beginning. Not a unique concept, starting at the beginning when you die, but an odd one for a racing game. And for a game with such drab gameplay, repeating the opening levels numerous times is more punishment than consequence.All in all, if you're looking for a Road Rash equivalent, keep looking. This game offers no redemption.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is a game that really evokes strong nostalgia for the Road Rash series and other similar games, while throwing in interesting elements from other action/driving games. The combat is fairly satisfying, hectic, and has some great visual feedback. It's fun at first, but then you start to encounter some problems.For one thing, the physics are REALLY rough. I understand that this was (is-being, rather, as it is still in Early Access) made using Unity, and this is an ambitious project for the engine. Bouncing around canyons and buildings like a racketball while screaming at a hundred miles an hour is humorous at first, but I found myself quickly frustrated as I would tap a rock on the side of the road on accident and then be propelled into the sky a hundred feet up. Or better yet, scream down a road as fast as possible and run into a slightly-protruding drain pipe and suddenly come to a dead stop. For another thing, the skyscraper levels are interesting, but dumb. You get a grapple gun and jet boosters. The grapple gun is difficult to use, especially as there is no tutorial for it. The jet boosters are fun, but given the tight turns and deceptive nature of the tracks, you will likely plummet to your doom. Again. And again. And...again. Also, there are only a handful of different tracks, none of which are particularly inspired. Even the rainbow road one is little more than frustrating. The first few missions have you repeating the same track with different start points or a different time of day, but it can get tiresome once the gameplay begins to wear thin.And finally, the game is rather unstable. It's crashed on me three times so far and I've only played about 80 minutes of it. I understand that this is early access, but it is still very rough around the edges. I like the combat a lot, I like the light RPG advancement elements, I like the variety of weapons. This game shows a lot of potential, but has a long road ahead of it before I can give it a thumbs up. Once they iron out these issues, it will definitely be worth getting, but until then, ride on friend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game nails the feel of Road Rash, particularly with its controls. The swerving is tight, the way your rider stiffens up to take a swing with his weapon, kicking other riders in midair, hitting the brakes to power through a turn horizontally, landing on riders to knock them off... it's all there.The destruction is fun and ludicrous. The original Road Rash had a more ""serious"" feel to it, while this spiritual remake turns it up to 11 for good measure.With its short levels (2-5 minutes of intense racing) and the cash/xp rewards model that doesn't really offer any poor choices, this is a great ""pass the controller"" game to play with others and it's easy to play ""just one more race"".Pros:-slick action arcade racing mechanics-large amount of vehicles on screen-great draw distance-good collision detection and sounds-wide tracks-highly replayable campaign-includes New Game+-multiplayer on the horizon-pretty good uptempo music-generated level geometry feels consistent, works well-guns feel substantial and are well balancedPros that used to be cons but were improved by development:-powersliding/skidding now feels weighty and fun-critical attacks now look special-more vehicle enemies which create traffic chaos on the roadsCons:-no interesting differences between enemy rider types other than durability-camera can be annoying and finnicky on rooftop levels, can't see where you're landing-engine sounds are kinda boring and inconsistent with your speed-audio cutting on gunfireBugs, Issues, SuggestionsAs an early access title, I don't count bugs as Cons as these issues will likely be fixed with development time-Experience point abilities could use some more interesting choices aside from increased health, damage, critical hits, etc-no gender selection (Player or AI... Road Rash did have the infamous Natasha, after all)-could use some more rolling road hazards. The logging trucks are a good idea, maybe throw in gas tankers that can be shot for explosions, tractor trailers that are carrying cars, and more trucks in general-no oil slicks or ways of losing traction like Road Rash-jumps make you lose speed, no purpose to ramps being in the middle of some of the levels, perhaps stunts will be added for experience/nitrous/health gain effects?-more racing types or ludicrous level effects would be great... perhaps modes such as Slalom, Guns-Only, Always-On Nitrous-no chain weapon (come on this was a key Road Rash weapon!)Conclusion: For an early access title this is so far a quality experience, and is nowhere near the realm of early access games that come out unplayable or with false hopes and undelivered promises. Humble Deal or Winter Sale makes it a no-brainer, and at the original price it's still a great value for anyone that likes Road Rash or action/arcade racing, and hopefully when the success comes and the sales roll in, the developers (who seem like great people) will continue to make meaningful updates and get the game to a solid 1.0 state.Thumbs Up!

								Well alright, this scratches an itch I've had for some years now. But it's not perfect. It's not finished either so that's to be expected. Pros: The controls are pretty good, although firing handguns is super hard. Graphics look nice, although a bit uninspired.Cons: Opponents are too good. They drive perfectly and never hit anything or run off the road like I do constantly, they do melee combat perfectly, they shoot handguns perfectly. This is not great for the players confidence.There is no story whatsoever. No avatar modification or creation.No upgrading the bikes.No countdown before the race starts.Music is not great. Not horrible but pretty damn boring if you compare it to Road Roash, which we do of course.Stages in the campaign mode are randomized. Wtf for?There's a meter that tells you how far along the track you are and how close you are to your opponents but it says nothing about the layout of the track.I'm sure some of my gripes will be adressed in future updates and playing it in it's current state is still fun. Just not as fun as it could be.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								You can't get around the classic Road Rash series from the 90's when talking about Road Redemption. I was a huge fan of the RR series back in the day, so I was really excited when I heared of this new game. And now it's on Steam! Altough not entirely the same as Road Rash, it reminds me to it in many ways. If you ever played and liked Road Rash, you will definitely like Road Redemption too. Even though it's in EA at the moment, I already had lots of fun playing it; racing while beating the crap out of your rival gang members with various melee weapons and firearms. Get launched from you bike when you smash into something because you weren't paying attention. There are straight forward races for the top spot, races where you have to defeat a set number of rivals or races where you have to attract as many police officers as possible. You can earn money, wich you can spend on more health, nitro, damage you cause and much more. However, you loose all this, when you die. Besides money, you also earn XP, wich you can use to upgrade various aspects. These upgrades are permanent, even after you die. So you get stronger and better equipped, every time you start a new game. I also like the soundtrack; varied music tracks wich suit the game very well. Graphics and sound are descent, not great but they get the job done. Overall I'm quite pleased with the game in it's current state. Development is ongoing so it can only get better. It's difficult to say if it's already worth your money, looking at the amount of content. For example, MP is not yet available. It's just very subjective. Everyone has to decide that for themselves but for me, as a huge fan of the genre, it is. I just couldn't wait :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

For those of you who haven't played Road Rash:Road Rash was a game in the early 90s where you grabbed your Ratbike (because it leaves droppings everywhere...geddit?) and took to the open road, merciless punching, kicking, whipping, blunt-objecting, mother-insulting and racing anyone foolish enough to try and ride alongside you.Along the way, you earned cash, upgraded your bike and progressed through the game. It's a simple premise.It was, basically, the video game that your mother referenced everytime she had book club and the ladies started ranting about senseless violence. Hence, of course, it was arguably one of the best games of all time.Road Redemption is Road Rash re-done, with a couple of extras thrown in - there's a better upgrade system in terms of EXP which makes the game feel a little rogue-like - not a negative point at all, since it allows you to have a couple of races, crash and die, upgrade your stuff if you can, and not worry about being stuck on some difficult level without progressing.During breaks in levels you can use your cash to buy upgrades at the store - these upgrades only last as long as you do: once you die you lose these (but keep your EXP upgrades).There are also a lot more weapons, which is fantastic, and riders and bikes with stats that affect gameplay.If you have played Road Rash:It's Road Rash basically.What I would like to see:Voice-overs. In the style of Quake and Unreal Tournament, annoucing when I'm on a rampage or something.Additional bikes and weapons are a maybe, as well as a larger skill tree. New maps and locations would be fantastic as well!All in all though, this game is quite complete, and definitely a recommended buy!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								It looks like a lot of fun! The developers also care deeply about this game because they keep optimizing it! If you have a modern computer you will enjoy it.BUT OLDER COMPUTERS BE WARNED: It is semi-playable as of the September 27th, 2014 update. The miniumn requirements are a lower than they should be. You will have problems running it if not at the recommended settings.I own a Laptop with a dual core 2.1 ghz processor from 2009. It gets the job done when I want to play some older games (I can even run skyrim on low settings decently).  If you turn down the settings down to 'fastest' setting and change the resolution to the lowest you can get acceptable framerates that allow you to play the game without too much of problem. You still might suffer from random studdering and low framerate. At least now you can acutally able to control your character and even knock some other npcs off their bike. The first level for some reason is very resource intensive (maybe too many cars and objects loaded) but the later levels run pretty well. At this time I can play it but I still get frustrated when the controls don't respond as quickly as would like (but it is definitly better than it was before!). Still get a few random pauses in the game, and the framerate will drop when something happens.I think what I'm more impressed is how much the developer has optimized this game, even for older computers. At this rate it wouldn't suprise me if it could run on a ti-89 calculater with all thes updates. If your computer has better specs than my potato-top then you got yourself an awesome game.

								As a big fan of the original Road Rash back in ""the day"", this game does live up to the same feeling.  Still has some bugs to be ironed out before it's finished, but a completely enjoyable game.  I destroyed a semi using a lead pipe and planted C4 on another bike, and he blew up 3 others.

								I love this game, it takes me back to the 90's! This is Road Rash 64 in HD, or a very close approximation of it. The only thing missing is the abiliy to jam your weapon into the front wheel of other riders, that was always a blast for me, especially if I could jam their front wheel in mid air! I hope the devs add this feature in the next update.Hours of mindless violence and motorcycles, what could be better? If you are of the N64 generation, this game is deja vu. Highly recomended! I also have to give a thumbs up to the ""campain"" design, its unlike any other game I have played.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is it. This is THE current most accurate and closest game we have to Road Rash. And I'm going to go ONE step further and tell you, guys. The game is even BETTER than Road Rash. Leaving nostaliga a side, this game is SO ♥♥♥♥ing good. Everything about it is just awesome. The gameplay, the graphics. THE MUSIC!You need to buy this game. Not only for you and your friends, who are gonna have A HELL of a good time... but also to support one of the most hard working developers I have ever seen on Early Access. This team work their♥♥♥♥♥off.. and they DELIVER. Again and again, presenting us HUGE updates that make the game more robust, more complete... just one step closer to perfection. No one gave me a free key for this. I paid it with my own very money and it's the most well spent money in an Early Access game I have ever bought. And trust me, look at my collection... I bought a LOT of games. :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
A Good Feeling, Often ForgottenBefore I get into specifics about the game I want to highlight something very important about it, something that in contemporary games is often so drowned in an abyss of complexity and glamour that we forget to even reflect on it: Road Redemption is FUN.  Every single time, without fail, laugh-out-loud duck-and-flinch old school video game FUN.  I spend most of my game time in that aforementioned abyss, straining my intellect and grasping for immersion. Road Redemption has taken its place in my apothecary as a balm, a revitalizer for my spirit, after such sessions.This game flashed by on my front page for weeks before I really looked into it; I didn't look too closely because I figured it was some sort of glorified street-moto Trials clone.  What opened my eyes to it was a search by tag ""Permadeath.""  I'm a big fan of permadeath mechanics in general so I became ravenously curious and dove into a game forum spiral,Risk of Road RedemptionTurns out, at its core, Road Redemption is a fiercely indie, happily absurd, fresh, new, and ridiculously satisfying roguelite.  Let me clarify by discussing the major gameplay elements.  The loose premise is that you are a gang biker trekking across USA, west coast to east coast, for some reason that somehow involves a boss level at the end.  RR does not for a moment pretend to have a rich and nuanced plot.  The trek is divided into more than a dozen stages that take between five or ten minutes each to complete. Gameplay is traditional 3rd-person motorcycle race style with the control schemes to match (this will show my age, but it reminds me fondly of playing Road Rage in the arcade back in the day).  So how is it roguelite? First off, each playthrough is entirely procedurally generated- the road maps, terrain, and absurdity variables (sometimes you'll get a level with ""hallucinogenic chemical zones"" that are filled with bright colors and cars falling out of the sky, other times the whole course is made of skyscraper rooftops, etc, etc); the enemies, their names, attributes, and gang affiliations; the weapon and item drops; and the game type for the level (for example, one level may involve getting the police to really notice you, another will be about smashing a rival gang, another will be a simple race).  Second, Road Redemption uses the modern meta roguelite paradigm that more or less rules the genre at the moment.  You permadie again and again and again but you can earn xp during your playthrough that can then be spent on permanent meta-perks like more health per level or higher base melee damage.  It's more challenging than some of the examples out there, because if you don't earn enough xp to buy a perk, all that xp dissappears.  Nonetheless, bit by bit, I find myself (sometimes) stringing together more and more levels before the inevitable fatality (other times, I just die- but man is it a fun ride). ""What I take from writers I like is their economy...that's magical."" -Mos DefRR shows great economy of design. It's indie in the beautiful way only our age allows and it does not strut like it's AAA. There is no chaff, no filler. It doesn't pretend to be something great or profound. In fact, if anything, it is proudly and defiantly banal.  And therein lies the magic, that special something that makes a game fun with no pressure and no strings. Just FUN.And in our lives of overwork, overextension, and exhaustion= I have to say I really appreciate that.RR is in Early Access so I will hold off on a number rating, but I will say with great joy- If you just want something FUN to play, get this game. You will not be disappointed.No Drama, Just Reviews***Also, SHOVEL KNIGHT*** ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game will give you nostalgia. I used to love Road rage games back in the day. This one lives up to that name for sure.It's a rouge-like type game but with races. You get different weapons and different mission which are randomized every single time you start a new game. Once you beat missions and start progressing you get power ups inbetween races/rounds. Along those you also level up your charachter and can unlock abilities which are permanent. This means you keep coming back for more and more action. There are 5 bike choices at the start and they vary in acceleration, grip, steering, top speed etc. You can also pick riders, it includes a flaming pumpkin as a rider so you can be Ghostrider too lol. Other noticible biker is a Shovel Knights character as a rider. There is a Psycho rider too which i think is the reference to the Borderlands Psychos but i am not too sure about this one as it looks a bit different.Gameplay is very similar to the old Road rage formula. You race and in the race you get to bash your opponents with a variety of weapons including guns, pipes, baseball bats, shovel etc.  This game is very arcade-ish and races can be very adrenaline fueled and exciting. Very very fun gameplay in my opinionGraphics are decent, not the best out there but not that bad either. For an arcade type game like this you don't need top of the line realistic graphics anyways. Some of the maps looks very good while others not so much so i guess graphics are average.Sound can really use an improvement in my opinion. The crash and hit sounds are not that good but then again the game is in Early Access so hopefully we'll be getting improved sounds in the future. Music is nice though.Conclusion : Very nice game. Pick it up if you like arcade racing and/or are a fan of the Road rage games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								I'd like to agree with most initial impressions of this game. In fact, I do - on *FIRST IMPRESSIONS* this game is awesome and full of potential.  But it remains that - potential. All too quickly the loose-and-lazy slap-dash approach of unprofessional early access devs becomes apparent. As a demo it's great and gets you excited. As a proper game? It's rough, unbalanced, repetitive, buggy, generally unpolished and has barely been seen any meaningful updates in months. I feel the design of this game has lost it's way - the dev blog hasn't been updated in over 12 months?!  How about sharing a roadmap to completion.Don't buy if you're hoping for a finished, polished game worth playing more than a couple hrs. I bought in hoping they'd follow through and now I regret it.==================update - I've been contacted by the devs asking to discuss my review, which is very decent of them. I appreciate that they take the time to engage with feedback on a 1 to 1 basis. The response was literally ""yes, we know, we are working on all those things"".I think regular news posts on what's to come might manage expectations a bit better?If you're interested, these are my issues:- Transparency.I am invested in this Early Access game because it shows potential. I don't know what your priorities are going forward toward v1.0.  Early Access is (usually) where devs take feedback and keep their supporters in the loop about future plans, yet most updates are minor polish/bugfixes with no mention of what's next on the list. Also, no posts on the dev blog since mid-2014... This leaves me wondering what the developers believe the game needs in order to be considered 'complete', because people investing during Early Access might want to know. Heck, in the very least I hope the developers consider *listening to their early access supporters* somewhere on the list of priorities, because why the heck do we buy-in to an unfinished game in the first place? Because we believe in you...Some aspects of the game could be awesome, and instead feel 'tacked on' / meaningless.- StoryNothing? any motivation behind playing the game? even Road Rash 1 had basic NPC dialog that meant something...Suggestion: invest in making me care about progressing thru the random content. Even just a bit of text explaining the backstory is better than nothing.- all the things, all the time.choose a bike, choose a rider, have lots of random weapons, figure out all the controls, all the tactics, do all the things - in your first race?!   Everything is there. Nothing feels especially useful. Suggestion: A carefully crafted progression whereby the game begins with just a couple of options, and as I progress, I learn about each new weapon / gear / perk / bike / rider etc as part of a well designed game... I am told there is a plan for this but ""it just isn't in the game yet.""   If there's plans for this stuff - *tease me* with it in a news update, and I will fall in love with this game all over again!! It's a no-brainer!- randomly generated missions.Why? Sure in theory it's 'less repetitive', but honestly they're all pretty similar in practice and you get no warning of what's coming next. Suggestion: Different missions require different tactics and/or equipment.  Foreshadow what's coming and let me choose my perks / gear before tackling the next leg of the journey. This system works well in countless other random-encounter games, and would work well for a 'pick a path' progression across the map of the USA - eg: route A is more direct but dangerous, route B takes detours but offers better rewards.Perks System -A lot of choices, a lot of them redundant in certain situations, or too cryptic.Suggestion:  Make these choices meaningful! eg: explain what criticals are / how they work before asking me to spend $ on improving them.- GUI it's terrible. I assume this is getting an overhaul at some stage...?- Online Multiplayer ...? it's totally ok if you can't do it - just say so already!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Genre - Racing whilst FightingI never really got the Road Rash bug back in the day but played similar games like Chase HQ and Road Blasters. This game is actually really fun and the developers seem quite passionate about it. The levels are as varied as they can be with one taking place flying over rooftops with jet propulsion and harpoons (I was quite happy staying on the road to be honest). There are various weapons you can pick up and you can get upgrades between games. There are also permanent upgrades, definately a mechanic to follow, as seen in Rogue Legacy and Iron Fisticle. This means that if you are crap like me, if you play the game enough you will progress, not just keep falling at the same hurdle. There are other bikes and cards to contend with. Sometimes a straight race, othertimes a battle. You will crash if you ram into things not bouce off like in some games, which I like as it adds to the tension, but the game can still be forgiving re-setting you and taking some health. I would recommend giving this game a blast, I am not biased as I received a free copy of the game, honest. If anything I would more likely give them a bad review to show my neutrality!

Early Access Review
								When it first came out, people ♥♥♥♥♥ed and moaned that it wasn't like road rash. When it came out, they ♥♥♥♥♥ed and moaned (and some still do) about low frame rates. They ♥♥♥♥♥ed and moaned about the sound track, the gameplay, basically everything.Road redemption is a great example of an early access game that actually gets worked on over time, as it should be. Early access is a scourge on games. Especially because people seem to think two things. The first thing being that buying early access gives them a seat at the development table (it doesn't) and the second thing is that for some baffling reason, most people assume the early access means finished product. Road Redemption has come a long way since it's inception, going from a somewhat shoddy bike racing game with combat, to what a modern iteration of road rash should be.  The frame rate is smooth, much smoother than it was when I first got it. The controls are responsive and easy to learn, also an improvement from it's early days. The enemy bikers are ridiculous and fun. I encountered some guy wearing huge bullhorns on his head, I promptly shot him in the back but apparently he was a boss with a longer life bar than most so I had to beat him to death with a shovel. A sort of flaw that isn't really a flaw is the games rubber band AI. If Road Redemption were a regular racing game, it would be a flaw. Road Redeption is a combat game though, and so this habit of enemies to soft lock onto your position only serves to make fighting them easier. That's not to say you can't take a cheap shot as you sail by some chump with one of the games many weapons. Both guns and melee weapons to choose from. These weapons can be earned by killing enemies, or stolen from enemies by interupting one of their attacks with counter while unarmed. Some of the weapons are very difficult to get without stealing them from enemies. The sound track is great, perfectly complimenting the gameplay and the graphics are appealing.It's a deal at 20$.

								Extremely fun and addictive both playing solo or with a group of friends. Also brings back good memories from Road Rash times.  The only drawback is gamepad compatibility issue (as of October 2015 Early Access (EA) stage) for Logitech Cordless RumblePad 2 and another older generic gamepad. Sure, this issue can be fixed with Xbox360 controller emulator, but would be nice to be able to play without it straight out of the library. Looking forward to the seeing the final finished game version.  9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								TL;DR: Game is fun and well done motorcycle combat with melee and guns. Early access means less content, not a broken mess of a game. Looks good, sounds good, and plays good. Solid 8/10.This right here is a game that gives one at least a little hope in early access. For those whose only concern is whether it's another DayZ ( minus most of the hype): NO. The devs are actively working on this game, adding content, and keeping their priorities straight.So how's the actual game? I never played the original Road Rash games, so no nostalgia goggles for me. It's good, simple fun. You choose your rider with various bonuses, your bike, and you race along generated stages with a mission. Controller support is on point, and playing with a keyboard (my preference) is just fine. The controls are great.The game looks pretty nice. It's made in Unity, so it should run great for most people.As far as the actual gameplay goes, combat and the sense of speed are superb. Melee combat works great, the guns feel nice and fluid. A lot of the game is generated as you go alone, including the stage layouts, weapon drops, and missions per stage. The game is designed for several playthroughs, and it works pretty well. I will say some stages will start feeling a bit too easy once you make sufficient progress in your skill tree. The soundtrack is damn fine as well.TL;DR: Game is fun and well done motorcycle combat with melee and guns. Early access means less content, not a broken mess of a game.

								**********Early Access Review Date: 24/04/2015**********DO YOU REMEMBER ROAD RASH? DO YOU WANT A MODERN REMAKE OF ROAD RASH? IF YES, BUY THE HELL OUT OF THIS GAME RIGHT NOW. IF YOU AREN'T SURE, ALLOW ME TO REGALE YOU WITH THE TALE OF MY EXPERIENCE WITH ROAD REDEMPTION.I watched the trailer for Road Redemption and immediately knew I needed it in my life. I bought and installed it, eagerly awaiting my early access experience, knowing that even if the game doesn't progress beyond its current state, the devs claim that there's already a solid 10-15 hours of gameplay implemented. I believe that this may not be entirely accurate. You can't call this gameplay - this is an experience.My first run, I didn't make it to the end of the first track. I wasn't entirely sure on the controls or mechanics, but it seemed fun enough. Did I mention this is a game with permadeath? If you get a game over, you spend your XP on some permanent upgrades, then it's back to the start. Any unspent XP is discarded. Killing enemies is the best way to tip the odds in your favor here - every kill nets you some boost meter, some health, some XP, and some cash. Cash, and the items you buy with it, are lost when you die. Depending on your playstyle, you may find that you prioritize certain items which complement your playstyle. I advise you to save this approach for later. Become comfortable with both the selection of melee weapons and ranged weapons. Learn how explosives work. Learn to use the grappling hook, once you get it. Did I mention there's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed GRAPPLING HOOK? Learn to parry enemy attacks. Learn to kick other racers into oncoming traffic or environmental obstacles. Learn what shortcuts look like, and when to use them (or not to use them). Learn to use your jump jets, when playing on rooftop levels. Learn to disarm enemies. In short, learn the ins and outs of the game's many and varied mechanics, to ensure your success. Which is never guaranteed, since each run is randomized. Sometimes there are snow levels. Sometimes one of your fellow racers will be driving a car intead of a motorcycle. Sometimes it won't be a car, but a truck filled with logs, which spill out and cause everybody behind you to crash out, completely filling your boost meter. Sometimes there's hallucinogenic gas.There are still some rough areas of the game - parts of the UI need work, parts of the soundtrack, which is mostly great, is... less great. Sometimes the game will decide that I should be facing the opposite direction in the middle of a race, just for funsies. It also takes too long to get back into the action after crashing out, especially on the rooftop levels. I also kind of find myself yearning for actual graphics options. And unlockable bikes/riders. Those are just little niggles, though,  and the game IS in early access, after all.In short, if you like combat racing games or the original Road Rash, or just want to play as Shovel Knight riding a motorcycle swinging off of helicopters on a grappling hook and smacking racers with a medieval mace, buy this game. It's really good. Also, it has 4-player co-op, and online coming soon.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								If Road Rash and Carmageddon had a baby it would be called Road Redemption.The gameplay basically is a remake of the Road Rash series from the 90s, spiced up with some crazyness of Carmageddon.The result is... pretty cool!Despite it's early stage the game is quite a lot of fun,whacking rivals off their bikes with an arsenal of weapons just never gets old.Graphics are decent and the soundtrack rocks,there even is an upgrade system and a bunch of bikes and riders to chose from,however there is still a huge amount of potential for additional awesomeness.What I'd personally like to see in future releases are customizable names, colors, bikes and riders,as well as different climates / biomes.There is also not that much replay value, yet, so I'm excited to see what the devs come up with.Maybe a level editor and a stunt mode? Would be neat to have loopings and rampsthat shoot you into high heavens for points. But that's just my 2 cents...If you liked Road Rash back in the day you can't go wrong with this game.

								Don't know why i didn't recommend this from the beginning, but that's being corrected now. This game is outright fun & ridiculous.Played this a lot before it was on Steam so just a heads up.Driving a motorcycle on on-going traffic, avoiding cars (and some 'want' to hit you), kicking/hitting other bikers to their death (they try to do the same to you), holding and shoving them to crash into a car, shooting them while maintaining and driving through traffic, placing C4 on them and getting the F away. Jumping from one rooftop to another, sometimes using hooks like spiderman to reach another rooftop.. this is just insanely fun!With a nice and challenging campain, with new campain+ , and local splitscreen (soon multiplayer) coop/pvp.Also, just to keep in mind this is still in early development, bugs, preformance issues and whatnot are present, so just a heads up.This is next-gen road rash. This is fun. This is ridiculous. This is awesome. ten out of ten, would spiderman C4 a guy again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I bought this game over a year ago hoping it would bring back some nostalgia from my road rash days. While it kept me ""entertained"" for a while, in the end it's not even close to a complete game. I feel like there has never been any clear direction for the project as it just seems like a bunch of redesigned road rash features mashed together with no purpose. The reason i loved road rash was it gave me an incentive to win each race (or at least finish on the podium). This would grant you cash so you could upgrade your bike. The progression was satisfying and you were excited to get that new bike.The opponents didn't seem generic. You might get knocked off your bike by Bill in one race only to get your revenge in the next race. Each race felt like an extension of the previous. Unfortunately in Road Redemption none of those Road Rash qualities come through. There is no real story, and no incentive to win races (I don't like the idea of character upgrades, it should have been bike upgrades). The controls are nice, the graphics are nice, and you do get a bit of enjoyment out of using weapons to disable your opponents but it gets old really fast without the fun ""grind"" you got from Road Rash.

								Put in your album with songs to kick♥♥♥♥♥to.  Soon you're going to be flying around corners and in between cars, hacking through your competition with a machete, flying off of random jumps and over traffic as you nitro, outrunning fast semi trucks looking to ram you and 4 other guys off of the road, planting a bomb on that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ then getting out of way before they decide they want to take you with them, getting chased by cops until you kick them off that bridge or into that roadsign, burning past your competition and moving onto the next race.When I used to play Road Rash, there was an chaotic excitement that kept us coming back.  Although I haven't played Road Rash since I was young, I sometimes find that that same excitement with my past favorites is no longer there, even though the game itself may still be fun.   Road Redemption gives me that feeling again, not the same way, but in it's own way.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Iv had this game for a while, wasnt very impressed when i first played it but after the recent update it has become a very addictive, very fun game. Combat is satisfying,blocking to parry enemy attacks gives an element of skill to combat. The bike handling is good,feels like a rollercoaster ride. The available perks between races are random so you need to choose what suits your situation,often takes you one or two minutes to choose what you need most. You have one life throughout the campaign so you need to manage your health well,because when you die you lose your perks and restart from the beginning, although you do get to buy permanant perks with each death. And when multiplayer is implimented its going to be an amazing game. Road Rash was a long time ago and its nice to have a worthy replacement. 7/10 with room for improvement.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Grab a shovel and get on your bike.If you're old enough to remember Road Rash, this game is much like that, except more fun and brutality.You're a bike gang member, let's call the gang Leather Trousers.As a member of Leather Trousers your sole purpose is to destroy every other rider by utilising kicks, punches, and a variety of weapons.The more mayhem you cause and races you win the more money you get.You use the money to purchase upgrades like additional damage and increased health.You lose these when you die.When you die your accumulated XP is spent on permanent upgrades that you will utilise on subsequent playthroughs.The game has a few bugs/annoyances but nothing that kills your enjoyment.So put on your tight leather trousers, grab a shovel, and ride out.

								I really want to like this game. I'm a huge Road Rash fan. Unfortunatly, the gripping flaw is how the bike interacts with the road. It just doesn't feel real in this game. The physics were awesome in the original, but here, the bike doesn't feel that there is any suspension, the grip of the road isn't there, and gravity hardly matters. I also wish the upgrade system was different. In the original you worked hard to save up for expensive bikes and then tuned them up. Here you just stick with the same bike and upgrade your character through your deaths. After that, there isn't much replay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Road rash with better graphics!! Thanks to the developers who are working on this game, this brings back the memories.If you love road Rash you should buy this game. The game works great for early access. Waiting for multiplayers and other game modes! expecting some changes that will improve gameplay:	optimization-the frame drops are ridiculous	voice overs for riders and cops	character and bike customization	some hard rock music would be awesome while racingOverall this game is really fun and brings back the good old road rash memories-10/10I recommend that you get the game in early access but you need to have patience and understand that this is an early build.

								I don't have a ton of time in it so far, but what I've played of Road Redemption have been fun. It is very much the spiritual successor to Road Rash, which I greatly enjoyed on my PS1. Besides the basic combat, which this title mimics well as far as my memory serves, it also layers a progression system. You can purchase perks with the money you've won but they vanish after you die. You also earn experience, which can be used to upgrade other facets of your character than remain even through death. This adds almost an RPG/roguelike experience to the game. I only have a few quibbles. The rooftop levels are the least enjoyable for me. They seemed neat at first, but it's very easy to miss the same jump over and over again or become stuck on parts of the roof geometry. Still, it's nice to have something besides the same basic roads to race over repeatedly. I also have some periodic issues with getting knocked off my bike for no apparent reason. Minor issues aside, Road Redemption is an excellent way to get your Road Rash fix. I look forward to future updates to refine the polish on this already fun game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In its current state it's really fun to play and has all of the heart of feeling of the original road rashes. The game has a long way to go and i hope the devs continue to make it better, but it is worth a buy if you are a fan of this type of game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I've played through the main Early Access campaign once, and I have to say that this is genuinely a fun game.It plays really well, with a combination of player and game generated cinematics that can get pretty crazy at times. An item/skill you gain use of on a certain level really adds too it, and makes gameplay a lot more fun. The permanent upgrade tree helps balance out the challenging aspect of the game by giving you something to work towards. I prefer to play with an Xbox360 controller on racing missions, and with mouse and keyboard on missions that require you to take down enemies. Thankfully you can easily switch between the two in the esc menu. I look forward to seeing what is added in the development process, playing through campaign+, and the upcoming online multiplayer.Also the Dev's are great as well in terms of communication and bug fixing/updates, that must be said.

								Loved road rash and whilst this lacks some of the comedy there's a lot of fun to be had. The recently added classic mode is much more Road Rash than the main game.Why lacking in comedy? Well for those who played Road Rash the bikers voices were always funny and here they are just somewhat lifeless.However split screen multiplayer is a blast and something hard to come by these days, especially on PC.Once we have online up and running and dependant on how well this work it works it's well worth a look. If they add some more amusing biker sound effects too then it's nearing on perfect. Even as it stands I've had a lot of fun with this game so give it a go if you liked Road Rash.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Early Access Review: I think it's coming along really well. I'm having a TON of fun reliving my childhood with updated graphics and gameplay. The campaign, once you beat it 2-3 times, can be beat in like 30 minutes or so, but I'm on my 7th time beating it so it's got high replay value. There is a campaign+ mode, too, which makes things harder. It's got a LOT of potential to be something great and I firmly believe it'll become that. It's a great pick up and play game, especially with a controller, if you got some free time and don't want to commit to games that require hours of your attention at a time for the full effect. This is a very instant gratification game so far with high replay value. I'm about to go beat the campaign again because the core gameplay is just so rewarding. Highly recommended!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Yeah, I'm going to have to recommend this. I have to say it takes me back to the days of the Genisis with Road Rash. This is much more fun though since you can do a little more customization and develope your play profile. The game can get a little crazy with turns and things falling out of the sky. The traffic almost becomes insane at later levels but even though it detracts from the reality of things a bit, it make sense that the game should get harder as you get further into it. It would be nice though if the environmental hazards (crazy turns and heavy traffic) were replaced with harder opponents or goals. If someone could make an openworld game with this kind of action, it would be awsome. This game, for the price has given me a good amount of fun. I did get it on sale though. It would be even better if there were Steam supported multiplayer. If you like racing, a lot of butt kicking and progressive profiles, this game is a good one. It still gets regular updates too.

I've heard this before...)- The player XP system is pretty stone age.- No customization of anything at all (I was hoping to at least choose a motorcycle to ride or the type of jacket my rider is wearing)High Points:- Weapons (lots of them).- Motorcycles (can't choose different ones though, sadface)- Updates.

								Look here now! I see all the thumbs down at the top but would like to say...You! Are you the kind of person that likes arcade style games? Do you want something deep enough to feel like you are getting better and accomplishing something yet enjoyable and can be played casually?This game is just good motorcycle beat em' up fun. No its not Road Rash, but for me it scratched the itch for vehicle thrash action. Hey, you still there? Smart guy... Do you feel like grabbing some fool and smashing them into the back of a moving car? Kicking someone off a bridge? Taser them off a building? Yes you sick freak, you can do that and IT'S FUN.Do you remember those old racing games that had fighting? Skitchen, Road Rash? This is a different take on the old formula. Race or complete objective all the while avoiding danger or causing it. Oh, and did I mention you have levels where you hallucinate and you race with cars raining from the sky! SO. MUCH. FUN! Its not the deepest game in the world but for a fun, upgrading, surviving, vehicular thrastacular adventure... if that's what your into you won't regret this purchase a bit. This is one game I havent uninstalled because its always fun to go back too. Maybe it will be one of your regulars too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The game is simply awesome. I did the scummy thing and pirated the version that was out last November, but now when the June update went online I immediately tossed out 20 euros for the (still) early access game. I think it has improved tremendously, the gameplay runs very smooth now, the soundtrack is good, fighting enemies that shoot back at you is just pure enjoyment and mayhem. The driving is maybe nicer with a controller (I hooked up a Dualshock PS4), but shooting is of course easier with a mouse and keyboard. The game is fast paced and hard, as it should be when it builds on the legacy of Road Rash. I played them on Sega genesis and on PC in the 90's, and RR feels a worthy successor. For a challenging arcade style drive-and-fight, just get the game. I really hope the developer(s) manage to implement online multiplayer, because that  would make this a real hit I believe. As it stands, the gameplay feels pretty much ready for a full release.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Remember Road Rash? Been waiting for something like that since the 90s? Me too. Well this is the spiritual sequel we've been waiting for. Even in early access, Road Redemption is pretty solid. Motorcycle racing and combat together again, but this isn't just a re tread on an old game; Road Redemption brings the basic idea to the 21st century with multiple weapons and different objectives keeping things fresh. The control feels pretty good and I personally have not run into any bugs as of yet. Be aware the game is in early access and is unfinished. I'm eager to see what's new in future updates. I would love to see a larger variety of bikes and riders to choose from.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

**Alpha Version 0.002 Review**ROAD REDEMPTION is the spiritual successor to Road Rash and is a thrilling jaunt through the open roads, rooftops and rainbow roads, fighting enemies and winning the races with fluid controls.Positives:+ Dynamic maps, weather effects and mutators (car rain)+ 60FPS Support+ Near-on full use of the SteamWorks API to deliver achievements, trading cards, cloud saving and more+ Large assembly of melee weapons, not always straight upgrades (different speed, damage, critical % and reach values)+ Car crash crinkles+ Different modes+ Good level of air control+ Local multi-playerImprovement Opportunities: - most of these are likely just a result of being alpha state- Maxed out graphics settings leave something to be desired in texture quality- When playing with a controller, you're still required to use the mouse to navigate through the menu- Enemies attack in a predictable manner- Current version does not take away the grappling harpoon and boosters on non-skyline maps (bug)- Poor draw distance for dropping assets (eg. cars are only generated very close to you, ~ a few hundred meter)- Current Campaign state takes ~40 minutes to beat- Bonuses for kill streaks would be a good addition- Unity launcher options made available in-gameAlpha Thoughts:Compared to other Early Access games, especially those in an alpha build, Road Redemption close to justifies it's current sales price (AU$15 at present) with even it's existing content.  I'm still finding myself playing through Campaign+.Definitely one to watch, Road Redemption is a promising racing / fighting game.  It plays more ""arcade-y"" than Blur and is a great couch game.Other NotesI received my Early Access key at no cost from a developer directly.  Post beating the game, I was given a prompt screen where I could ring a developer and talk about my experiences.  It's great to see, and testament to the indie model, that I could have such direct access to the team to discuss my feelings towards the game and voice my suggestions.Asking the developers what the terms are in relation to uploading game-play to YouTube - I was informed both over Steam and via phone call that I can upload any game-play material, music or other assets from the game with no restriction (this may not apply to you!).  I see some other players have already started uploading footage, so hopefully this'll have the intended effect of bring more players to the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The game is a good and fun arcade game, but I'd not call it a racing game nor a (spiritual) Road Rash successor, it's more a rouge-like driving game.Except for the bike combat theme this game has nothing in common with the Road Rash series.The game takes itself not really seriously: Rainbow Road as track, Roof Top racing track, raining traffic, Jet Pack, this annying I throw all the time bombs biker, not really Road Rash like soundtrack (EDM), did I forget the grabbing hook ?!So, the game get's a positiv vote from me, because it's fun and I really like to play it.

			This game is Road Redemption. Enjoy. Read my steam review here - http://steamcommunity.com/id/SatanovichZ1/recommended/300380 Support new Gaming YouTubers -...		

The graphics look alright. It feels very much like an arcade game to me. It’s not gritty, it’s fast paced and you can easily maneuver your motorcycle midair. The game is definitely not a simulator and it doesn’t let sense stop you from being able to do some outrageous things.-----Not that really it affects gameplay but the aesthetics could use some polish. This is to be expected from an early access title, especially on it’s initial release.----- If you miss a jump you will fall into a mysterious grey void which is the point where structures cease to exist. And here you will find random props suspended in the air and other motorcyclists who suffered the same fate.-----I like the v-twin sound of the your avatars bike. But I think riding a sportsbike that sounds like a racer would be cool too.-----In some areas I suffered from low framerate with the graphical settings set to ‘fantastic’. Lowering the settings to ‘good’ alleviated this. 11 But framerate was still an issue where large amounts of vehicles were present in close proximity.At the moment there is only the option of campaign mode, either single player or splitscreen coop. There is no online mode yet. I played solo.-----In campaign mode you play through a series of levels. Most levels take place on a highway populated by road vehicles.-----It is cool to ride your motorcycle at high speed through traffic while brawling with other motorcyclists. Trucks overturn and spill their cargo, blocking the road and you constantly have to avoid cars that have gone out of control. You will miss some obstacles by only centimetres.-----Some levels take place on roof tops. You and the other motorcyclists must all make jumps from rooftop to rooftop. For some reason automobile traffic will also occasionally join you on the rooftops. They aren’t very good at making jumps.-----Every stage has a different objective which appears to be randomly selected, such as racing other motorcyclists, attracting police attention or taking out a number of other motorcyclists without using weapons.-----Occasionally there are special hazards present. Theses include a motorcyclist who constantly throws timed explosives onto the road behind them and ‘car rain’. You might want to keep your distance just so that you can survive and make it to the next stage.-----All other motorcyclists and certain cars are hostile. They will swing weapons at you or try to drive you off the road. You will lose health when you take hits, fall off your bike or fall off a building. When you run out of health it’s game over.-----You have the choice of up to three weapons at a time. You can acquire different weapons by dispatching foes or completing stages. Most of them are melee weapons.-----Initially I used the gamepad because I figured that it’s probably better than keyboard and mouse for controlling a motorbike. It is probably is better for controlling your throttle. But then I realized that this game has guns and the game pad sucks for using firearms.-----I would recommend using the mouse and keyboard solely for this purpose. Being able to use your guns effectively and your ammunition efficiently means a lot in this game.-----Weapons aside, the coolest way to dispatch other motorcyclists is probably by grabbing them. You can take them by the neck and maneuver them into oncoming vehicles or obstacles.-----There is also a grenade launcher which you can fire from your motorcycle just like terminator II. I was very happy to see this.-----You have a limited nitrous boost which you can use to make your motorcycle go faster. You magically regain nitrous fuel as well as health and earn extra cash by taking out motorcyclists and other vehicles.-----In some stages you also have jets that allow you to jump and glide. It’s ridiculous but, I thought this was awesome because it was just like riding a motorcycle from one of my all time favourite games, Full Throttle. The problem with it is that there is no indication when it runs out of fuel needed to boost you over a void.-----After completing each stage you can spend your cash on items, most of which last until you die. Items effects range from recovering lost health, minor increases to your rewards for taking out other vehicles and completing races or extra lives albeit with the loss of most of your maximum health.-----When you lose all your health during a stage you finally die for real and it’s game over man. You will have earned experience based on the total amount of cash you earned in your run. Your experience can be used to purchase upgrades which will carry over to future attempts at the campaign.Currently there doesn’t seem to be any sign of the ‘truly epic quest’ story line. But it will cool to see it and online multiplayer in future updates. Personally I wish there was open world MMO game like this with minimal ‘RPG’ elements, I think that would be awesome.-----This game was challenging, I only made it halfway through the campaign after numerous attempts at it. Sometimes what you are rolled with can be really difficult even on the first level.-----But it’s fun. And I think the price is reasonable for amount of content as well as the potential replayability that the game offers. I definitely recommend thinking about getting this game.Since writing this I have completed the game in it's current state. It's actually not very long at the moment, although I did say the game had a good amount of content. But an update is scheduled soon. Presumably more content will be released with this update.Also I recommended using keyboard and mouse in my 'review'. However after using keyboard and mouse more I realized that the gamepad is actually a lot easy to maneuver your motorcycle with.﻿Click here for my YouTube gaming channel			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								When I was younger I was a big fan of Road Rage 64, saw this game and course had to try it. Can't complain to much about the game itself, it's a bit better than I had anticipated after reading the reviews. However my main issue here is the developers say they're close to bringing the game out of beta, but I have absolutely zero idea how they can figure that... The game has many bugs still and isn't quite refined yet. It's actually quite frustrating at times, here's a list of a few things I can recall that have really bugged me in my first 4 hours on this game;-NPC bikers set routes are a bit over powering - IE I'll try and take a short cut, but if an NPC biker is next to me, you better believe that if I'm in the way of his route, he'll turn into you and take you with him. The NPC bikers can really manipulate the direction of your bike, but you can't quite do it to them.-General physics - I love that it's pretty easy to jump into this game, the driving isn't too difficult, but some of the physics are horrendus. Getting stuck on a cars bumper, invisible walls above rocks and other objects (whats the point of having a jet pack if you can't fly over objects?), smashing into a wall and staying on your bike, but clipping an electrical post and going flying.-NPC damage and taking damage - they do little damage, which is kinda nice, but my major issue here is when you do successfully hit an NPC with a melee, they don't get dazed by it like my character does. Why is that? I'll be so close to accomplishing a new level, I'll hit and NPC while they're mid swing, do damage and somehow they're still able to get their attack off. That should exist for the player as well, or make the NPC's get dazed for a moment like the player does.-Lack of tutorials - As I mentioned earlier, it is fairly easy to understand how to play and what is going on, but there's no tutorials at all and there's very little or vague explanation as to what some of the items do/how they work.Overall, I am enjoying this game so far, but it does come with it's moments of frustration for sure.If you're interested in this game because of Road Rash - I'd say give it a try, if you don't like it within the first hour, return it, simple.My suggestion to the developers - Don't get ahead of yourself when it comes to progress. Keep doing what you do, be honest about your progress and people will continue to support you until you can get the game out of early access.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								PROS:Road Redemption is really fun, even at this early stage. I'd compare the combat with the horse mounted battles of Mount and Blade, only on a hyper-speed motorcycle that can boost. It's extremely satisfying to line up a perfect critical hit with a battle axe against a cluster of rival bikers. The way the cars and characters are constantly flying across the screen in a physics-tornado of destruction is incredible. The gameplay loop of short racing/combat challenges, buying temporary upgrades, and then applying earned XP to persistent skills is smart and addicting. The game is frequently updated by its developers.  CONS:Performance inconsistency has been the one thing I have found frustrating, but it is to be expected at this early stage. The current build as of July 5th will fluctuate back and forth from over 100 FPS to 30-50 FPS in a matter of seconds and I'm running it on a GTX 970. Earlier builds ran really consistently, but as the has game progressed, the optimization has suffered. I expect later versions to run much better.  I also feel that, at the harder difficulties especially, there is too much pipe bomb spam from enemies. It seems like a cheap way to artificially increase difficulty. I imagine that the devs will continue to balance the game to correct this in the future. FINAL THOUGHTS:I've gotten more than my monies worth at this point from this game. I can't wait to see what the devs bring to it in the future! I'd love to see an ""endless"" or open world RPG mode, perhaps in a sequel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								-+-EARLY ACCESS REVIEW-+-This game is still in the early stages, so buying a product this early in development will always be a risk. So far, I've had alot of fun playing this title.  Ton's of action, laugh out loud moments, and on a few occasions my jaw dropped.  I've played roughly 2 1/2 hours of the campaign so far, and haven't reached the final mission yet.  There's alot of challenges and various missions.  A lot of features are still missing in Road Redemption, and I'm hoping the $20 dollars I spent on this purchase will go a long way as development continues.  This feels like Road Rash, a title that hasn't been released in over a decade.  I can neither recommend or not recommend this game, as far as its too early to judge.  A twenty-dollar bill weights differently in people's pockets, but there is ALOT of promise, momentum, and potential in Road Redemption.  So purchase this game under your own risk with faith this game will be completed before the price spikes up.  Gameplay is there, the graphics are absolutely fine, I just feel like the empty content is holding Road Redemption back. 6/10(Once some more game modes are released like a quickplay(just choosing to race or do takedown missions with multiplayer options) are introduced, I'd give it an 8.75)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I've got to say that I'm positively surprised with this early access title. Road Redemption is a next-gen son of Road Rash, a great old title which I enjoyed back in a day. It features a XP-based upgrade system along with store where you can buy items, crazy physics and many game modes. It's definitely a breath of fresh air on lately released games, not your usual racing game. It'll suck out hours of your life and you'll find yourself stuck to the screen.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Only thing bad i can say about the game is that u can not save a playthrough, so you must end it in one go or leave -hope the add some saving point-.Give me more weapons to make my enemies fly and crash :)7/10 not bad for a game in progress.

								Nothing's more satisfying by grabbing your opponent and crash them into oncoming traffic. Or kick them off a bridge. Or taze them with a cattleprod. Or pump 'em up with lead, Terminator style. Or stick C4 on their bikes and watch them fly through the air. Or decapitate them with a machette. Or...Definitely a must buy for those old school Road Rash lovers. The whole setting and gameplay breathes nostalgia. Even some of the music reminds me of that. Installed this game again after a long time and there has been huge updates since. Haven't encountered anything game breaking bugs yet and the ones I did encounter were minor, which I'm sure will be ironed out by the devs. The game has  been amazing so far and once online multiplayer gets integrated, this game would be perfect.

								I bought this game upon its first release and was pleased initially but left with wanting a little more. After this current huge summer update I can say the game has certainly taken off in a great direction. The enemy variants and improvements to the AI have made this game an absolute blast to play on both the regular and higher difficulty levels. So much so that there is a bit of strategy involved into how and when to engage targets as well as timing blocks,grabs,and c4 plants at the perfect times. Overall I'd say this was definitely a solid and worthwhile purchase and it continues to be so as the devs are constantly working to add and improve the game. With online play looming in the distance, this game is destined to truly shine.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								It does seem similar to the famous ""Road Rash"". But this is not that game. It is not made with the intent to be that game. Stop comparing this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed game to others for ♥♥♥♥s sake. Now, onto the review.This game is really fun. It is fast paced, reflex intensive, and honest good fun. Yes, this game is early access, and yes it doesn't seem to get ""massive"" content updates every week. However, it is not abandoned. It is still supported and actively being worked on. They actually want to make this game and complete it. The developer gives you a number to call, they are dedicated to their work.While the menus are a little clunky looking, you can tell that it's made with love. The graphics are relatively good, by no means bad. It looks very pretty, although I think the draw distance could due to have a little bit of an upgrade, but it's unity so it makes sense. If you're into racing, motorcycles, kicking people into oncoming traffic, whacking people upside the head with shovels and nailed bats, shooting your way into first place, and blowing up police cars, then you're gonna be into this game.

								If you grew up in the 90's and remember the old ""Road Rash"" games it's pretty much exactly like those. The graphics are pretty nice. The gameplay is actually very functional and fun. I used my xbone controller and it worked like a charm.If you enjoy racing games, games where you can attack other racers, or like I said above any of the ""Road Rash"" games then I can garuntee you will like this. That said I recieved this for free and I think $20 is a bit too steep for this game. I recommend buying on sale. Now get to racing and rackin' up those manslaughter charges!!!-Casey			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Very fun, especially in multi player. Highly recomend 4 player action for lots of yelling and a good time.  The last level of the game is a bit of a surprise. There is also an interesting surprise at the end of the credits that I totally wasn't expecting. Feel free to follow through on that surprise, I did and was NOT expecting the result I had.  Well done Ian.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I kickstarted this game. It sounded like best racing concept ever. And it still does.But execution is jus f****ed up.Campaing gameplay consists of series of missions that you play until you die. There are two mission ""types"". Kill X people before timer runs out and race. I hate timed missions with passion, but amount of required murders is usually low, so unless something bad happen, first type it's doable.But if you were given ""race"" mission, you already lost. Winning means getting 3rd or better place. That may sound easy until you realize that opponent AI keeps other bikes slightly slower than your top speed is as long as they are in front of you and keeps them just behind you after you overtake. That means every time you slow down, everyone you ever overtook flashes in front of you and gets ~200m advantage. EVERY. Effing. Time.And you will slow down eventually. Either by hitting something, getting stuck in scenery, getting stuck in another vehicle or just by trying to get through curve. My favorite place is curved road just before finish line in 1st map. I can get there 1st with no problem, and then choose if I let everyone overtake me by slowing down, or just fly over the road and let everyone overtake me while I respawn. Aaargh...Rest of stuff as points:+ graphics looks good+ music is great- vehicle & character selection doesn't remember choice+ keyboard bindings are configurableand my personal favorite:- gamepad can't be configuredwhy, just why....

								My nostalgia! This game is a spiritual successor to Road Rash and does everything amazingly! While still early in development, the game is pretty stable. There are a couple issues with boundaries, but overall you can play through the levels without crashing.Lots of weapons, a few bikes, and a few player skins. I'd like to see higher resolution textures at some point, but its still early in development. I highly recommend this to anyone who loved Road Rash, and I can't wait for online!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								What an amazing game. So much fun, and it's still in early access. I bought this early on in it's development, and it was a blast to play then. More if not all early access games should be this awesome. It keeps getting more updates, fine tuning, and somehow better with every patch.The racing is done well, the combat is done very well, and the sense of speed is fantastic. It's tremendously satisfying to kill opponents with the melee weapons, and the sense of ""GOTCHA!"" that you get lining up a head shot while speeding down a highway will leave you beaming until you crash head on into oncoming traffic. Which reminds me.... grabbing other racers and steering them into oncoming traffic might just be the most satisfying way to kill in this game. RPG elements extend the lifespan of the game greatly, giving you something to buy at the end of each game that will enhance your abilites in the next attempt.This game might not be something you sit down and play for hours and hours at a time. But for the past 2+ years, I find myself loading this game up time after time and having a blast with it every single time.VR users: this game works well for me with TriDef and Virtual Desktop. Play the game in 3D, it'll be worth any dowgrade in gfx settings :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The closest we will ever get to a new RoadRash game until EA either get their head out of their a55 or sell the I.P.It's still a bit limited with features right now. With 1 old skool kind of mode where you do race after race to see how long you can last buying some temporary and some perminant upgrades between levels, and I question how balenced it is to add guns to the game but the potential for greatness is here.Not worth full price until it comes out of early access but still good, assumbing they do a good job once it comes out of early access that is...

My Thoughts/About The GameThis is a very fun road dash game. Good game to kill time. I was interested in buying this game because of a youtuber I watched. If you like shooting or hitting people with shovels and you like racing games then this is definitely for you. The campaign is decently long, and the levels get tougher. Some of the levels include racing on rooftops with a grappling hook. However, I do have some problems with this game. The AI needs to be fixed up. Some of the maps need to be tweaked a bit. Finally, upgrading your racer is really weird. Why not remove this since it's so confusing. In Conclusion For an early access game it's a good start. However, I'm afraid that this game will lose its hype. The updates are rather slow. Many problems need to be fixed, and hopefully the community grows. I really want this game to become the greatest; if not, the best road dash ever. The concept is very interesting. The game is still in development, so that means that I will update this review in the future when the game is complete. Finally, I recommend this early access game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								While it is not the most in-depth game (in its early access state, anyway), Road Redemption is a great pick up and play arcade-style game, a gem in its simplicity. To me, it strikes a nice balance between an arcade racer and a beat 'em up. Typically, I will only play for an hour or so at a time, but I find myself coming back time and time again to give it another go. I typically play simulation and 4X games, but this is a nice break from their more in-depth play.Pros:+Smooth game/graphics - plays well on high settings even with an older AMD Phenom II X6 1100T and GeForce GTX 770.+The fact that the missions and courses are procedurally generated means that progress actually makes me feel like I'm playing the game better, rather than just memorizing the courses.+Fun game to play local multiplayer with controllers.Cons:-No network multiplayer yet.-The missions on the main campaign feel a bit generic. Have to see what happens as the campaign is finalized.Overall, if you like games like Metal Slug, Gauntlet, or the older Cruis'n series games, you'll probably like this.P.S. - I know this isn't a popular opinion, but I do kinda like the occasional missions where the cars drop from the sky.

								I actually love this game. Not becous it is easy or has a good story. But because it is so freaking hard that you will keep playing it for hours just to get a tiny bit further every round. The part that makes this game so hard is that you can turn the camera veiw around to attack enemies. But you also need to look out for obsticles, and other riders, while raceing your motorcycle. So every time you look away, you will have a hard time following the road. Sounds easy, and should be. But is really, really hard. So don't play it if you are a keyboard thrower, or have a bad temper.You get permanent upgrades after every run. so keep digging deeper to get that extra bit of XP. And there is a ton of weapons, perks and upgrades to earn. And a hand full of different motorcycles and costumes to choose from, to keep you busy.Note that a lot more content will typicly be added later. I will give this game 7,5/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Road Redemption is a simple, yet satisfying experiance. It is a lot of fun bashing your opponents with blunt, sharp, long, and explosive weapons. Shooting however needs refinement, and is janky as all get out. The level design starts off bland. but quickly becomes very intense as you jump highrise rooftops trying to bash other riders off into oblivion. Only 5 or so bikes available at the time of this review, although  the developer promised to be making more bikes in the future. Oh yeah, his actual phone number is displayed in game, and I called him. Much to my surprise he answered and we talked about how things were going. It was refreshing to be able to give input directly to the develpoer.$10/10$ DEV NUMBER IN GAME NOT SWAMP MONSTER ASKING FOR TREE FITTY			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I am not a big fan of racing games, nevertheless I have so much fun playing this game.It is in early access so there are a couple of bugs here and there but is doesn´t affect the gameplay at all. The content is perfectly enough for an early access game and I still haven´t finished the campaign because the levels are getting harder and harder.I got this game on sale for 10 bucks but I would say its also worth a buy for the full price of 20, just because it´s just a game where you can casually get on it, play it for a couple of hours and have a TON of fun, because it is so damn satisfying when you knock that biker of his bike or let him crash into a car, it is AMAZING. Probably one of the best purchases I made on steam. looking forward to multiplayer :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								It was June of this year that I originally purchased Road Redemption and soon after got a refund because of the early, glitchy mess that I found. I recently was contacted by a Road Redemption Developer recently, asking me to give the game another try now that they have been working on it and asked me to tell me what he thought of it now. This review is a summary of what I have found.Road Redemption is, quite honestly, a fun game. Gone now are the vast sea of glitches I was initially met with and I have now been served up with much more responsive controls, better, tighter gameplay, a refreshed look about the whole thing, and an all round tidier experience.Road R has came leaps and bounds from the game I had originally canned. Dying now is no longer an annoying set back caused by falling through a floor or stopping dead for no reason and more becaause of the insane cluster ♥♥♥♥ of battling bikers that excites more than dissapoints.The rooftop levels needs just a tad more work to it, I noticed that for what ever reason, the A.I seems to get faster on roof tops, just barely staying out of your reach many times but this is a small flaw in what is now an other wise brillantly fun a manic game.Also, special mention to the player friendly attitude of their team. It's a rare thing for a developer to not only listen to their critics as much as their fans and respond in such a positive manner. Enough praise can not be give to this team or their game. Well done.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Road Redemption is reminescent to the good ol Road Rash days; bash people in the head with various weapons and kick them into oncoming traffic at high speeds, hearing that satisfying ""crunch"" sound as they crash into a dead stop. This game is unique in its upgradable elements such as the bike, health, weapons, etc. You ride through different missions with a single life, but your experience remains the same after death. Here is the rundown.Good:+Like Road Rash+Car crashes+Upgrades+Decent graphics+Satisfying kills+Different mission types (kill rivals, race, no weapons, etc)+OSTBad:-Still undergoing lots of work with physics and graphics-Controls are a bit iffy on the keyboard-The sound effects are minimal*I would love to suggest improvements for the game; there seems to be a lot of boring ""dead space"" during gameplay for my ears. I think maybe having an announcer or more sound effects or at least some more atmosphere going on while playing. *I would love to see a rival system. Like if there were bike gangs/groups and if you killed a member then that group would be more inclined to attack you in other missions.*Would love to be able to buy different bikes or at least change their look/style.*Would love to see visible damage; if character is low on health, perhaps helmet is cracked and road gear has some scuffing and holes in it (or bike damage; fire, smoke, sparks etc)*The attacks are fine, but it would be great to be able to hold the attack and release when you are ready instead of the awkward timing (yes, road rash did this, haha)Other than that, the game is pretty cool despite it's slightly unplayable for some people (myself included), but is being corrected and improved. The devs are really great and really want this game to work. Please share with them your thoughts and comments!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								As much as I wanted to like this, however in it's current state I can't. If you are thinking of buying it, I suggest waiting to see if things such as control/physic improve.It has the potential to be a fun and engaging experience, saddly it fails to deliver a smooth and consistent experience. While it ""runs"" exceptionally well with next to no problems there are a number of design flaws that are more then apparent.Bike Handling seems to sit between an arcade style and driving a brick on an skating rink. At times the handling sensativity goes from very low and unresponsive to a twich style that overcompensates for what your aiming to do. This becomes very noticable while trying to corner only to slide off a rooftop (or bounce off one)Overall Physics/Hit Detection are terribly ballanced with riders able to effortlessly push and overpower you from side to side while vehicles are able to bounce you like a ball in a pinball machine. To your own bike hitting into other riders moving the slightest bit. As far as object/hit detection goes, often I found my self coliding dead on with various world objects only to be stopped dead in my tracks, having to utilize the ""reverse"" controll to fix my positioning so I could go to the center of the roadway again.Combat while fun also falls to some major design oversights. Melee combat is divided between two buttons for left and right attacks, taking up two keys that by all rights could be done by one with side detection being utilized from what direction your leaning. The developer ""claims"" to have tried this but found this was better, how I am unsure as using any typical controller this layout is non intuative and uncomfortable. Ranged Weapon combat is plauged by it's use of the camera to do the aiming. This then puts strain on not only the poor driving mechanics but having to manage the camera being locked inplace waiting for movement as opposed to following the bike while not in use! A terrible design oversight as you are forced to constanlty ""aim"" while your weapon is out or use the non intuitve means of selecting a different weapon. Lacking dedicated weapon ""slots"" also leaves something to be desired.My last issue comes to difficulty and penalties for failure. While in theory having a single life system sounds like a fun engaging way to reward progress. It is handicapped by an over the top health reduction of typically 50% of your max health for not completing your objective with in the rather narrow window provided to do so. Either from poor bike/combat controlls to a lack of overall HP to progress through each ""forced"" fight engagement. While in theory a great way to minimize combat issues it only adds more through being forced into fighting more then you may want or are able to.Bundle the above issues and you end up with something that comes across as a good concept only to find that it executes all of it very poorly.

								As a major fan of the Road Rash series from the Genesis days to the 3DO / Saturn days I had very high hopes and expectations for this game. I really would love for a spiritual successor of the series to continue off.However this game feel  short in many ways, and as a fan of the original for that reason I cannot recommended it.The first glaring problem is the visuals. The game is plastered with effects (heavy fog / post processing / bloom effects) that contrast with the aesthetics of the orgiinal series.The original road rash series had amazing visibility, bright vibrant colors, and very little in the way of visual clutter.Road Redemption however looks like it was ran through a series of Instagram filters that do nothing but ruin the game play (making it extremely hard to see where you are and where other bikers are).As an early access title I would assume the developers would be open feedback and potentially changing addressing these issues, however suggestions have fallen on deaf ears. The following attempts to bring light to the situation has yielded no results.http://steamcommunity.com/app/300380/discussions/0/613940109787258126/http://steamcommunity.com/app/300380/discussions/0/619573787361886299/I have given this game one year since initially trying it, sadly none of the updates have addressed these issues (has gotten worse with recent updates adding more visual clutter / fog/ HDR).If the dev team address these issues I would be open to changing my review, however at its current state I cannot recommend this game to any one who was a fan of the original series.

Early Access Review
								Trailer is really well done, but the game itself , at the moment, is not good. There are times when i know that the game is not finished and it can get better but this one is not the case. When i watched the trailer this game seemed really fun to me, and it is kinda fun, but the amount of flaws keeps it back from being a good game. God awful soundtrack (MAIN MENU MUSIC NEEDS TO BE CHANGED ASAP, it is so out of place i couldn't believe that), ridiculously bad animations when falling from a bike, beyond awful menu design , almost every race you will see no animations when crashing into things like big side pipes or when falling of the bridge, and the graphics overall are pretty poor looking. This game needs A TON of improvement in order to be enjoyable, i'm not saying that it can't be good, but i doubt that the developers could achieve that, and maybe a cornerstone in this will be their budget.I really hope that this will be a good, polished game one day, but in it's current state, i can't recommend it.EDIT: the developer updates this game really often, so at least it's not likely to be abandoned like some other Early Access games, and this is a good thing. Really hope that this game will be finished soon and i ,most definitely, will recommend this game any day .			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Ohh.. Road Rash... Those were some good old days!Now we have Road Redemption! Awesome game!!Pros:Lots of weapons.different bikes thus different specifications.Cool maps, variable maps.Cool skins.Great power-ups.Cons:Driving could be a little better.Losing health when shooting weapons is annoying.Ideas:Maybe give the player the opportunity to change the crosshair, from circle to just a simple dot.Shooting tires causes the player to fall of the bike. (maybe not a good idea though) takes away the fun.I definitely would recommend this game!  Buy it and you will not regret it!  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								To say this is like Road Rash is an understatement and the fact that you beat (and shoot) people to death whilst riding a motorcycle are the main similarities. For me this game is a lot better. With the RPG like skill tree you can permanently upgrade health, NOS, attack damage and many more upgrades every time you play using the XP earned on each play through.I found it was pretty hard to complete at first, however once I'd got the hang of it and upgraded some skills and weapons it's become more manageable but still a challenge.There's plenty of weapons to use which come in 7 categories: Swords, Heavy weapons (like hammers, wrenches), Long weapons (like shovels, broom stick, double sided axe),  standard weapons (bat pipe, mace), Pistols, Automatic weapons and explosives (C4, grenade launcher). All of which (apart from explosives I believe) can be upgraded in between levels.The attacking is very responsive you can duck (when holding a gun) or block attacks from enemies and also kick them out of the way or you can grab them and force them in to oncoming traffic. Shooting people from their bikes very satisfying especially if they're firing at youThe game is not just about winning races whilst killing as many people as you can. There are 3 different scenarios which are randomly selected for each level. These are: Race, Beat the clock to the finish, Target takedown (eliminating marked targets before they escape). Of course it does pay to take out anyone and everyone you come across (literally) For each rider you eliminate whether or not they are in the race or not will reward you with health, NOS, money and XP. The game is an arcade style in that once you're dead you have to start over and battle through the 17 levels to complete the campaign.There are a number of different bikes to unlock of different speeds and handling and also several different riders. I don't think there are any difference in the riders skill wise but I just normally use the first guy. Think he's called Jonny Sizzle :DFor people that have friends that visit your house as opposed to online I really liked the split screen feature where up to 4 people can play at the same time on one copy of the game.I've heard that online multiplayer will be coming to the game on its full release too. Rumoured to be October 2016In all this is a great game. Since the last update there are no bugs or glitches. Handling is really good and responsive.I've Still not fully maxed out the skill tree yet and there are more marked as coming soon. One thing I would like to see is a proper career mode and some sort of story with your gang. (Son's of Anarchy link would be awesome) 90/100  CurrentlyThis is the most fun I've had on a motorcycle since Road Rash 3D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game is so much better after the recent updates. It was already good, but it's feeling more like a proper game now.If you enjoyed any of the old Road Rash games, this is basically a mixture of some of those yet it still feels like it's own game. Defintely pick this up if you like racing games, motorcycles, sometimes ridiculous weapons, killing cops, etc.8/10 so far (up from a 6), could be a 9 or 10 if they add online multiplayer and some other modes or something.

								the Road Rash remake we all wanted.In its current state the game runs great, decent visuals, the combat is good, that sweet sound of landing a hit and dropping the other biker brings great joy everytime. Shooting guns in the game is my only complaint, feels ackward, maybe cause I use the controller to play, haven't tried playing using M/B yet, that might help. overall fun game, when multiplayer rolls out its sure to make it much better.

								     I am really liking this game now. The developers have made some changes that make this game fun to play again. The huge road block at level 3 with the masters race has been taken out so now your progression in the game lasts beyond 10 minutes of gameplay. That was a big step forward to making this game enjoyable. They didn't remove the black semi truck which used to be extremely annoying, but it no longer matches your speed when you are in range of it, therefore it's annoyance factor isn't really an issue anymore. I am no longer getting hit for over 50 percent of my health from one melee attack and In the few games I have played since the latest patch I am no longer experiencing the rider that blocks every melee attack no matter how well you time your attacks. This is also a huge improvement.     I am still keeping my fingers crossed that there will be a game mode inserted later in development which brings back the series of racing for points and progression to higher racing leagues which the old Road Rash games had. But The changes with the recent patch have made this game fun to play again. I'm happy to see the development team making positive changes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Road Redemption reminds me of the old road rash games, and that isn't a bad thing. Road redemption takes everything way farther than road rash ever did however. Adding guns and other schenanigans into the mix, this makes for a wild ride! I'm personally not a fan of the unity engine, as I've never played a unity game that felt polished. This game is much more polished than any other unity game I've played, and lives on in my mind as an example of what unity is capable of. As long as the dev continues to polish and update this game, it will turn into something special. That being said, it is already fun now, and you can get your money's worth out of the current build quite easily. -PR0XIDIAN			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I previously had multiple performance related issues with this game that caused the game to be unplayable for me. I posted a negative review that has since been deleted as all my prior issues are now irrelevant.The developers have greatly improved the game with continuous updates and improvements. The game has come along quite nicely since I purchased it during the 2015 summer sale. They even removed the misleading ""Multi-Player"" tag and replaced with the appropriate ""Local Co-Op"" tag on the store page. I am still looking forward to the addition of online multiplayer. I appreciate the continued effort of the developers and their involvement with the steam community. They developers are listening and implementing our feedback. I am glad I supported the developers and look forward to future updates on this incredibly fun game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Road Redemption is a totally f&%$ing mad Road Rash update on the Unity engine. Still in Early Access at the time of writing, while the game looks a little rough around the edges it is still mightily playable. Cars, trucks and bikes zoom and whizz in every f&%$ing direction, ragdolls fly through the air with the slightest of ease and all manner of blunt instruments are swung at your head from every side. Bludgeoning motorcycle cops and rival gang bikers is tremendously satisfiying and the actual racing physics is entirely satisfactory. Great stuff.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I usually dont play racing games. This is a racing game , but you also get to beat, hack and shoot the other racers. So yeah this game was lots of fun. Choose a motorcycle and a rider and on with the Road Warrior tactics. An easy game to play, with a little skill of handling your bike and how to kill all others, this game is well done. The music is rock, metal and a touch of techno that goes great with the atmosphere of revving motors and dying rival gang members. There is just one mode, in witch after choosing your rider and bike. ( Shovel Knight ) you go through a series of missions that basically all end up of you riding your bike as fast as you can, to kill as many as you can. After each mission completion use the money earned to gain upgrades to weapons, your bike or health. ( Beef jerky, hot dogs and burgers heal you).  Travel accross the US causing death on the road. After you die in game, you gain experiance on how far you get in the US ( aka how many missions you did) Then you use the experiance points to ugrade a talant tree, that like the between mission shop, you can upgrade your weapons, health or bike. These points in this tree stay perminant and help you kill and ride the next time you play. A great game with inventive weapons  like bats, metal bats, bats with nails, clubs, mallets, axes, machetes, long axe, crowbar, woodplank, hammers, pipe...yeah and theres guns!

								EDIT 10/8/16 ONLINE MP ALPHA ADDEDThis is a race mode that has 8v8 or 16v16 racing a single track with two shortcuts. It's rough, but it's an alpha. Will update review in time. As for now it's decent, but we've been waiting for it for like ever so it's pretty great too lolWhen I was a lad my neighbor had Road Rash on the Sega Genesis and one glorious summer we spent all our waking hours playing it.  I played this today and was intensely overcome with a sense of righteous nostalgia and I spent nearly the entire time I was playing with a stupid grin plastered all over my face.  I can only speak for myself but here's some review elements:Music: I'll be honest I have it turned off, didn't even give it a chance. I heard it at the main menu and it sounded cool? I have my own music playing most of the time though so this is generally a non-issue for me I won't rate the music.Graphics: They're ok, they actually seem pretty good to me however i was more concentrated on the gameplay than the graphics? More importantly it's pretty optimized on super-ultra-mega settings.(those aren't real settings. my GPU is a gtx970)Gameplay: I used a wired 360 controller for it. Three bikes right from the start, sort of easy, med, hard-ish? It's what seems like a pretty awesome feeling arcade controlled-Mad-Max-biker setup on the controls. Compared to the last ""biking"" i did which was GTAV- This is amazing! You can pull some super tight turns depending on the bike you're riding and the breaks and nitro mechanic work pretty responsively.I didn't really look for a difficulty setting, i just hit career mode and went with whatever is default, but it starts out pretty easy and ends up being more challenging and strategic as you go along, with different enemy types that are weak against different blade/blunt combinations, of which there are different types of swords, bats, and wrenches, just to name a few on the melee side. On the controller there's a button for Left and a button for Right side melee, you also have a trusty kick move which is classic, and seems to auto zone in on whichever side is closest and is good for giving you some space in a mob. You start out running a series of races on a randomly generated map with some objectives and other stuff. The better you do the more experience and cash you get. Cash can be spent between rounds, but then there's an almost rogue-like element where when you finally die you can spend your experience on like an RPG-style passives skill tree.  It was actually sort of cool to see that, so when you die you actually die and have to start over(Career mode) but you get to boost your next playthrough with other stuff, and respend your cash as you get through the races.I'm not sure how online would work but they plan on having dedicated servers so that's a big bonus in my book, and they aren't super cash grabby regardless of what people are saying. The steam board isn't super active but the devs will answer there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								""Road rash for today's world"", as prob. have been mentioned a million times...or at least in every review. :)So, you ask, what is it?It is ""Road Rash for...."" :PIt's simple, fun, graphics are more than good enough for the game, handling may be a bit too good as it may make you forget how ""arcady"" the game is.What I mean with the last bit is that you can't crash without running into something, even if you jump off a bridge you'll always land on your wheels, just like a cat....if cats had wheels....That's something I tend to forget and it sort of makes me lose focus on fighting and the environment - the real dangers - which means I will crash/get my head bashed in.Something else not really obvious is that it has a slight bit of rogue stuff to it, in that you can put constant upgrades to your bloke/equipment and such after you die at the end of a run, also that the health you end a track with sticks with you to the next track during the run. (but you can get burgers and such between the levels if you've earned enough cash)Anything negative?Only something I personally have a hard time with, the driving while also aiming with right thumbstick and firing with right button, like in GTA V, I'm not a huge fan of it due to having a hard enough time aiming with right thumb stick standing still. :) (as it seems I'm the only one in the universe being 100% crap at that thing the game will be flawless for everyone else ;))I don't regret buying it that's for sure and I even bought two extra copies that I'll give away on my Youtube channel, no, I won't let you know even its name....I'm a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ am I not? :) (I can say that it'll happen very early August, so searching for ""Road Redemption giveaway"" might work - and I won't even ask for a sub. 'cause I'm a nice sort of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ :))			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Road Redemption is Road Rash Reborn and it does a damn good job at it too. It delivers insane high-speed racing mixed with brutal combat that has you smashing other bikers off the road to score first place. (or whatever the objective is) The enviroments are crazy with cars colliding into eachother causing havok to avoid crashing into and cops trying to sideswipe you. Its a fantastic game to play in short bursts when you want something fast and furious to pass the time.THE GOOD+ The racing and combat is incredibly satisfying+ Graphics are pretty good for early access+ Randomly generated enemies/hazards keep things interesting+ The rooftop levels are super addictiveTHE BAD- Menus are very bland and uninteresting- Many melee weapons feel identical- FPS takes a hit sometimes on highest graphics settings- Lack of modes (The game seriously needs more modes upon full release)- Lack of customization (You cant buy new bikes or gear)THE UGLYWhen you die, youre DEAD. Time to start over again. (But at least you get to permanently boost your stats)BOTTOM LINE:I think Road Redemption is a fantastic game that gives many fans of vehicular combat the action they've been craving for a long time. I very much look forward to the implementation of multiplayer in 2015. Recommended. 8/10PROTIP: Playing with a controller is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

								So I loved Twisted Metal, Downhill Derby, Destruction Derby, Jak X, Carmageddon, Vigilante, Cel Damage, Full Auto, Blur, Death Rally.  Dude the list goes on.  There are a great number of underrated Vehicular Combat games.  Even the terribly bad ones, were still really enjoyable and funny as hell with your buddies or solo 1 v 1 with AI.  The concept is so gritty and simple.  Destruction Derby is a total throwback to this forgotten genre.  I can say with confidence that this game isn't just a great VC game, but a great and fun game overall!  It's a near perfect game as is.  Just a few tweaks here and their to make it as best as can be.  If they were to release more updates and dlc and additional Content plus a multiplayer, I'd be willing to keep coming back to it.

								Road Rash 64 was one of my favorite N64 games. It was fun playing that game with all of the crashing, hiting, and multiplier powerups. It even had some enjoyable fitting music, despite that it was not much or a few in total. This Road Redemption has interesting objectives and for the most part, fun. Potentially more music, if possible from a few past games or maybe custom playlist option (well unless that is already happening in game and I have not searched enough). Unless done, potentially spawn thunder that may randomly strike on and off roads. Alvanches to from mountains.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Not only does it remind me of games past, but it is a welcome change to most games out at the moment.Some times its just good to go really fast and smash a mans skull in with a pipe.Doesn't have internet multiplayer at the moment but aside from that the game is still really fun, a lot of my friends will be purchasing this when internet play is active.Would C4 officer Smiley again.

Even it in its current state it is already more fun than some games I have paid full retail for.  I am having a blast, very fun to pick up and play whether I have time on my hands to actually game or just a few minutes. I should add that it plays alot like the old game Road Rash but with modern graphics and much deeper gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Hey it's not bad at all for a Road Rash tribute game when no big name companies out there have had the gall to remake the classic. I enjoy the game a lot. Don't expect very in-depth, intuitive motorcycle controls, it's pretty basic (not a sim). A fun and violent substitute for Road Rash until when and if ever someone makes a legit remake of the series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I grew up playing Road Rash 2 and 3, and have been watching this game for awhile - I finally decided to pick it up when I saw the latest major update (June 2016) and have been having an absolute BLAST playing this!  I've been playing ~5 hours so far and keeping in mind that it's still early access, the gameplay is very solid and a lot of fun.  Every level is really cool, most have several shortcuts for you take, and the combat is fun and challenging.  WIth online MP due to come out next month, I highly recommend picking this gem up - it is pretty easy to pick up and is well worth the $20 price tag.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I bought this game ages ago, and had a ton of laughs -- the game at that time was fun, but unrefined and (perhaps unintentionally) hilarious.I just checked in again to see what's changed -- it is SO much more polished now, far more balanced. It's a tight racer/beat-'em-up, and is once again one of my favorite time-wasters.I definitely recommend -- it's surprisingly good, and now looks great, too. Not sure what improvements are planned for non-Early Access release, and it doesn't really matter. It is releasable as is -- any improvements down the road (which I expect, with the way this game has so consistently been updated/improved so far) are just icing on the cake. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								TL:DR Did you play Road Rash as a kid?Yes?Buy this.No?Need to blow off steam ever?Buy this.--After TL:DRThis game is a faithful reimagining of the old Sega Megadrive classic. You'll be cruising along on a motorbike while wielding all manner of weaponry, attempting to get ahead of rivals and police alike. (And by ""get ahead"" in this game, we frequently mean ""cause mortal injuries"".)This game is still in early access at the time of writing, and of course that means it might not be the most polished game you'll buy. And no, it's not – but it's by no means bad on any count. The graphics are okay, and the fact that it hails back to an old classic does, in my opinion, give it some leeway on graphics, because it can add to the nostalgia factor. The levelling and upgrade systems have recently had an overhaul, and I haven't had much time to play with the new versions but I think they're an upgrade over the old versions.Things I like:- The difficulty. It's not easy. A few levels in, I find there's a *lot* to watch out for, and the enemies are much tougher (possibly a little too tough, or maybe I'm just bad at the game!)- The ""hallucinagenics"" levels. That's creative, and makes for a slightly different level to most of the rest.- The weapons. Great range of weapons, and I see they've had some upgrades since I last played; you didn't decapitate people with the swords, last time I played Road Redemption. Now you do. - The actual bike driving. It feels gritty, fast-paced, and ... well, not realistic, but something along those lines.- Unlockables. This is, I think, a new addition. I like that there are bikes and riders to unlock now, and that the bikes have different stats. That adds something to the gameplay.Things I don't like:- The sound. This is pretty much my only big bug-bear; there's very little sound in the game at present. - The difficulty. I know I put it in the list above too. I just wish that there were some choies of difficulty setting.I have a few ideas for improvements, and I'll be running those ideas past the devs in the discussion boards.  Meanwhile, it's great to see early access devs who are actually working on their game, even months after release. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

That was the worst one, but it's an easily correctible one with a patch here or there. It in no way took away from my enjoyment of the game. It definitely has that Road Rash feeling. It's obvious they're trying to take it to the next level, and I like that. I can't wait to get some friends over to try this game out. (They don't ""PC""..... yet lol)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								EARLY ACCESS REVIEWDefinitely doesn't feel like a finished game yet but it has a lot of potential.Cons: It can feel 'weird' at times, giving you strange driving physics or random bugs (like getting stuck in a log/block/other random obstacle) and you can say it lacks polish.Pros: It already has this ""just one more run"" addictive quality of roguelike games and it is quite enjoyable to land that critical hit on a rival gang member or crash someone into an oncoming truck.So I wouldn't recommend buying it at full price at this time if your motivation isn't supporting the developer but it's definitely a nice game with lots of potential and with a little more polish it can become a really good title. P.S. I didn't even play Road Rash so this review isn't biased by nostalgia ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is a modern and revamped remake of Road Rash. I must say OH WHAT FUN IT IS TO RIDE!!! So glad I bought this game and I cant wait for the final release to come about! That being said, what has been done here is exactly what Ive been looking for in a game. Motorcycles, violence, guns, and speed! There are however some drawbacks, one of my biggest gripes is the motorcycle sounds. the crotch rocket sounds exactly like a harley and the harley sounds like....a harley. Im not sure how much expansion on bikes and types will be made but I would really like to see ""classes"" similar to the original Road Rash. (rockets, touring bikes, choppers, rat rods, etc.) also online multiplayer would be fantastic. I could see this game doing exceptionally well in that area of endless playability. If you are like me and grew up playing Road Rash 3D on a playstation....GET THIS GAME! its awesome even in early access! Great job to the team and I hope you will read my feedback!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								A Road Rash Clone, but you get guns.  What I enjoy about the game is that it features the same antics in racing that one gets out of Rod Rash.  While it is important to get a higher position, in this game, it gives more focus on attacking other cyclists.  That being said, it has alternate modes that it goes into that wasn't in prior Road Rash games I had played (granted the last I played was Road Rash for Windows 95, which was the same version on the 3DO console).  There are some odd places you travel, one being a path that features cars raining from the sky, and the player must dodge them.  Also, I find it interesting that such a game was authored in Unity3D; it is really proving how the technology is progressing.  Unfortunately, the game has some quirks.  Granted it is a mere ""arcade"" feel game, it doesn't focus on how a motorcycle or a car would actually travel on the road.  This is a mere notice as many people buy into games such as Mario Kart where they do not implement natural turning of a vehicle, but rather the rear of the vehicle pivots.  (contras this to say Tux Kart which gives a better example of how turning occurs with vehicles).  Additionally, the game has bugs where it randomly crashes on the Linux platform, typically after permanent experience level ups are awarded after dying.  Also, I'm not sure if it is a bug, but I've seen ""cars"" identified as ""npc"" enemies that are holding position in the race, and I'm supposed to attack them.  Again, maybe this is on purpose?  But I haven't contacted the developer to see.  At any rate, I have to give serious marks down on stability on the Linux platform, but overall, the game has a fun factor.  I have to recommend it at this time, but as time progresses, if these issues are not addressed, I will change my rating to negative; not because I want to as its a great game, but if the game does not work, what does one really have?

								If you've ever played Road Rash back in the day, well, this takes those rose-tinted memories of a game that probably doesn't hold up today visually and brings it to modern standards. Not only that, it adds an in-depth upgrade system. Initially, I did not like the way you lose all your upgrades upon death. As you keep the same health, unless you heal, from wave to wave. Then I realized when you die, there's permanent upgrades you can acquire that last game after game and the in-game upgrades are the carrot at the end of the stick for trying to get to those further and further waves. Overall, it's a brilliant system and I'm really looking forward to what this games turns into upon final release. There's some minor niggles with the camera (it's all mouselook) so you have a hard time keeping upon with the action sometimes or other times you'll notice it just feel off and then correct it upon thinking about it. Which can bring you out of the game. However, it almost feels necessary for when you get a gun to have that free aim. So it might be something you just need to get used to.I highly recommend getting this game whether or not you played the Road Rash of yore. The procedural tracks are fun and feel solid. Not just cobbled together. The weapons are diverse and quite fun to use. Especially the sledgehammer and old Remington from Terminator. I'm sure they will be adding a lot more content as well such as more bikes and players but in some races there's even a giant truck to contend with! Check out this marvelous brutal racing action before it releases and gets  a full price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								It's not perfect(and since it's still in early access, that's to be expected anyway), but it is a lot of fun, and the devs seem committed to getting updates done. If the idea of Road Rash meets rogue-like appeals to you, then you'll probably enjoy this game. The physics are appropriately arcade-y, and the combat feels satisfyingly brutal. It can be frustratingly difficult at times, especially if you're like me and don't have great twitch reflexes, but it's still great to play in short bursts. My only major complaint is with the mission variety. Nine times out of ten, I end up with a race. The races are fun, but I'd like a more even distribution with the more violence-oriented goals.

								Road Redemption isn't identical to Road Rash. Unlike what other reviews will have you think, this is certainly only Road Rash in the sense that you ride bikes and wallop cops with baseball bats. Also sometimes you have to race.While those things are a very large part of what Road Rash is, where this game is different is very obvious. It's got a much more arcade feel, with the one life is all you get policy. The melee battling is about countering enemy attacks so you can disarm them or critical hit them, rather than just zig zag punching them until they drop their 2x4.There's also guns. My personal favourite being the sawn off shotgun. Extremely satisfying to use and the reload animation is awesome. They aren't particularly difficult to use, being hitscan weapons. And since one shot is usually enough to put a rider out of commission you never seem to run out of ammo.The C4 is equally satisfying to use.The current race modes are a mixed bag. You can get anything from Jackie Chan's Kung Fu Kicking Competition to 10 tonne rain while trying to win a race. This isn't a bad thing by any means, the variety is good. But it's a far cry from Road Rash's rigid illegal street racing structure.And in the end it shows. The absence of a distinct race mode means the pace is set by the other modes where you try to kill as many cops or rival gang members as possible. And much of the time the race mode doesn't feel any different. The addition of punching bag bikers during a race slow down the pace considerably. I often found myself forgetting I had boost because I was having too much fun wailing on cops and these random dudes in the race and still ended up winning. Once again, this isn't a bad thing. But design wise I think it would be better to choose one or the other.On the few occasions a fellow gang member turned up, I found they would swing at me as they drove past. Their AI doesn't appear to be any different from the other bikers except that they prioritise the AI over you. In the full game I'm left wondering how establishing a biker gang and only having one life to do it all in will play off each other. I'd find it difficult to invest myself in a gang or my comrades if I knew the moment I died I would have to start all over.The Jump Jets attached to the bike during the rooftop level are a fun addition, but don't add much to overall gameplay on the non-rooftop levels. I often just ended up using them so I could shoot grenades at my feet. And cheat by jumping over crashes and huge logs. I never really found a use for the grappling hook, though it'd be fun if I could attach it to one of the helicopters seen flying over the tops of levels sometimes.Overall, I would recommend this game. But it is in a beta/alpha/whatever at the time of writing this review, so my impressions are obviously not going to be relevant when this game finally releases. Or at least I hope not because Road Redemption has a lot of potential.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Please take note this was uploaded when the game was in Early Access phase....Awesome! That's the game I wish I had before. Road Redemption is an adrenaline-fueled arcade racing game about motorcycle gangs beating crap out of each other on a highway. When you think: ""...and that's all?!"" -you haven't got a slightest idea how great this concept works. To be honest, I'm so excited about this game I couldn't really stop all these positive emotions exploding in my mind.Ok, let's try to be objective now. How about a quick draw of ""pros and cons""? Consider this:+ Gameplay mechanics. Fun, entertaining, randomly generated objectives.+ Controls.  You get to do a lot of things but it's allright at your fingertips.+ Music.  Each track plays out in the right moment,I don't even know if it's on purposeor it does operate randomly.+ Graphics. Nice and smooth. If you have a dated PC (like in my case),you could easily lower the graphicsto make the game run at the right speed,without exploring menus and options for decades.+ Overall simpleness. Don't get me wrong - it's a reallygood thing about this game, that it is notoverloaded with un-needed **** like other titles.+ Old school progression scheme. You get one chance to finish campaign,if you die - you start over.+ Character (Skills) leveling. While you can't save/load campaign or anythinglike this, you still get better and better when you get experience from each individual run.+ Co-op.   (coming soon). - (""Cons"")None seen. Maybe some improvementsfor the types, but that's about it.If you enjoyed games like Burnout Paradise, FlatOut or similar - don't even think, just GET THIS GAME NOW!!! Definitely will recommend it to all my friends.P.S.: Sorry for a tonn of text.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Get out your old grunge mixtapes, plug in your controller, and get ready for a return to the insanity of the 90s. I got in on this at version 0.001, and it was clear they knew what they were doing and how much Road Rash they played before the series took a dump and died (they even pointed out what few realized about the originals not actually involving turning in a dev diary). The amount  of progress up to this version is really impressive, especially in such a short span. The core game is fantastic, now it's all bells and whistles. While the game is still in beta and you can tell it's unfinished (car animations are minimal, the camera doesn't keep up so well, there's only one attack animation, motorcycles don't have any real braking animation/sound), the actual game is tremndously fun. It's a smooth update of the Road Rash style that works well in the age of analog control (much easier to hit that other rider now!) and provides more than just straight races, although going fast and bashing heads is the essence of any track. There's some roguelike elements to the game, too. You get up front purchases of helpful items between rounds that last until you die, and permanent, XP based upgrades like bike quality, total HP, etc., and I hope to get to choose a bike later on instead of just upgrading the same one.My only complaints at the moment are that the guns would benefit from a bit of aim assist (if it was EASY to aim a gun from a motorcycle, it would be boring, but it's a little too unweildy right now) and that the tracks lack features. If they're being procedurally generated, the array is a bit thin. Judging by the desert, there's only two turns, sometimes you see a ramp or a divider, rarely a bridge. It's still a lot of fun, I'd just like more of it.Both of these problems are entirely reasonable for early access, and the latter problem is a sign if how good the game is - my problem is that I want more!Best motorcycle combat racing game this century that lives up to the Road Rash legacy with ease. If they manage to license a few songs (this is a natural fit for Soundgarden) or build in an mp3 player, they'll beat it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Its probably best if this is gotten out of the way from the beginning... Road Rash!  If there is any game that Road Redemption can be compared to, it's Road Rash.At this point of the development, the game is pretty simple.  The player begins a campaign and enjoys some intense motorcycle action.  There is no real story at this time, and the multiplayer is still to come, but what the game already offers is well made.  The bugs are minimal, the game has never crashed, and it is very playable.The combat requires some work to get the timing right.  Each melee weapon has a different attack range and speed that it is swung, not to mention the satisfying sound that some of them make.  The sledgehammer is boss.  The ranged weapons are really powerful, but can cause a distraction while aiming that can lead to a crash.  Fighting against AI is fun and good practice, but this game could be crazy with multiplayer!Speaking of the AI, the npc cars may as well be tanks!  Some are pretty mundane and cruse down the road, but others are out for destruction and do not follow the laws of physics -- at all!  They make the rules as they plow through incoming cars without a budge.The game is pretty bare bones right now, but the devs have a really solid foundation to work with and some of the ideas that are implemented in this game are a lot of fun, but there is some fine tuning that needs to be done before the multiplayer can be engaged.  The time spent has been extremely enjoyable -- nostalgia -- better than many finished titles of this price.

								This. Is. Fantastic. While many other genre/franchise mainstays of the 16-bit era (platformers, JRPGs) have found a new home in the blossoming indie scene. One thing that had always fallen by the wayside was one of my favorite childhood games 'Road Rash' and its mixture of point to point arcade racers like Outrun, Hangon and Cruisin USA combined with a silly sense of violence that cant really be taken serious. Well this brings all that awesome, awesome, baseball bat with nails in it swinging, motorcycle riding, cop clobbering fun back. This is not a finished game by any means, but it is already fun. Yes, fun. Remember that? Well here it is in spades. Now get on yer bike and swing a shovel at someone. If that *thunk* of impact doesn't put a smile on your face, you might just not have a soul...

(Any head on collision or telephone pole smack should result in a crash)- not too many tracks. Rooftop track is underused.Verdict: $20 is a little steep for an unpolished product, but grab it whenever its on sale. The little nitpicky things don't take much away from the overall experience.

								To caveat on some other reviews, Yes it does get repetitive, There's not many weapon variances, you have several ""light"", ""heavy"", and guns.  You can kick people into oncoming traffic, off buildings, into signs and construction equipment, or you can just straight up shoot them/hit them with your weapons.  A lot of the levels are just replays like the rooftop levels, the only difference is how the AI reacts.  The worst thing for me in this game is how long it takes you to come back to life when you slam into a vehicle.  Watching counters it takes about 3-4 seconds to get back on the track, whats worse is when you try to use your nitrous to catch up to where you were and within ten feet of starting where you respawned you crash into another vehicle and have to wait to respawn again. The games fun for the most part.  Very Repetitive.  I have a friend who comes over and we play together which makes it a little more fun because you can take eachother on.  When playing co-op whoever finishes the best in a race is the score the entire group gets, when killing people all the kills are shared.One thing i hate is getting crazed drivers mode on the rooftops, it essentially does nothing.  If it actually had drivers on the rooftops it would be different.  Another thing that would be awesome to see is being able to play as a car once you beat the game as there are times when you're racing against cars.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I was never a big fan of ""Road Rash"". I'd never had a 3DO, and although I was a huge PlayStation fan, I'd be lying if I said I ever played the series in any of its subsequent incarnations — hell, I never even played loosely-similar games like ""2 Xtreme"".That said, I've come to find in ""Road Redemption"" a game truly worth loving and one of the few early access titles which I deigned worthy of my hard-earned dollars — and that might be a reflection of the game industry at large more than anything else. Or, it might just be because the game's ♥♥♥♥ing fun. Just buy it and stop reading. In an age when $69.99 will buy you something like ""Dragon Age: Inquisition"", where you get hundreds of hours of single player content and a comprehensive multiplayer offering, ""Road Redemption"" is shockingly bare bones. You have a couple of different ""race types"", realized through different level types, and a simple campaign mode which is basically the classic ""arcade"" style, where you start from the beginning and try to get to the end.In spite of this old-school design, the game brings some newer persistent-reward mechanics to the classic arcade design. You earn XP as you play, and that XP can be spent on persistent upgrades which make subsequent runs easier. As was true of most games since COD4 with this concept, it's successful in rewarding ongoing effort.But what makes ""Road Redemption"" worth playing is none of its novel new features nor is it hurt by  its lack of substance.This♥♥♥♥♥♥is just pure fun to play. Smacking someone off his bike is so satisfying, and shooting a car to the point of destruction to get it out of your way mid-race is exhilirating. For all its anemicness and rough edges, the game is just fun as♥♥♥♥♥♥to play, each and every time you play it, for 10 minutes or 10 hours at a time. And once multiplayer is in the mix? This game is going to be one of the greatest of all time.Just ♥♥♥♥ing buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I Got in early on this game and have watched the slow transformation from glltichy crap that couldn't compete with Road Rash on any system to a nitro slinging bat swinging Mad Dash addrenaline rush single player Powerhouse of a game.  I reccomend this game to everyone! Especially considering the fact that if they do the multiplayer correctly it will be one of the most exciting multiplayer racing games on the market,Things still need to be fixed however like-Can we please not have wrecked cars falling from the sky ( I swear its like playing through Sharknado but instead of sharks it is cars) instead add wildlife that can wander out into the road. Flocks of Birds or Cattle herds or something.-Can we please have a bike & weapon & parts market to spend our cash in between races-More Bike options please,,,,,Tires intakes engines brakes ( Maybe upgades like fixing battering rams or spikes to them)- Rider Gear....Give your standard rider some personal touches to make them unique to youOverall This is a great game that has come a long way.  If they keep up the hard work they will most certianly have a game that will indeed Redeem the Road Rash Saga......Only trouble with that is in order to Redeem this series this game in its final state needs to be better than all other Road Rash games....A Tall Order Indeed however seeing how far they have come since the beginning Im sure they can and will give us Exatcly that.

								Well I initially thought i would be writing this review to recommend it avidly. However, still in early access, with little or no progress made, and limited function, i am not going to recommend this game, which showed such amazing potential. But here's the dealGoodModern, enjoyable, road rash esque game play.Fairly pretty (if you have the spec to deal with it. Mine ran fine at top spec then the flying cars came in and it slowed to a crawl.)Does not take its self too seriouslyEasy to learn, hard to master.Good initial selection of rider skins. Would benefit from a ""design your own look"" option for eventual full version.Story mode. Great ideaBadStory mode. Badly executed. When there is a story, call it story mode. Right now, its 20 randomly arranged missions over a sequence of tracks.Enemies with power armour. Where's ours eh?Bikes. Initially i thought it was a fair selection for early access. Then realised instead of 8 (i think) you only have 5 as some are repeated. No option to use the bikes that you see rolling around, big spiky fatboy choppers or dirtbikes.Afore mentioned slowdowns when more than 10 vehicles are on screen, probably be fine on a newer rig.Psychedelic drugs mode infuriating and inexplicable.Guns. Overly powerful. Enemies inexplicably accurate when firing at you at their 6 o'clock, but still managing to avoid oncoming traffic.As a biker it upsets me that people still think that you can use a weapon right handed and accelerate at the same time. The throttle is on the right. They should have some sort of automatic cruise controll when using a weapon, limiting speed, maintaining (little) realism.Most of the skill tree still says ""Coming Soon""Ugly.Lets face it, its games like this, and Wreckfest, which are going to kill off the greenlight system. People will stop buying games which fund developers, because they do not want the developer to take their money and never finish the game. This is not Duke Nukem Forever, it shouldnt take 14 years to finish. Lets hope they (collectively) get themselves together, finish the games and take a leaf out of ""War for the Over World""'s book and finish a decent game, then keep pouring good updates and decent content boosts to keep us interested.

Red flag but I continued my journey anyway.September 21 / Night - I decided to speed the night on the road so I built a camp fire near the river.September 22 - I met a trucker, nice guy who gave me some directions.September 22 / Night - I decided not to spend another night on the road and I was eager to reach the next town so I continued my journey. It was creepy and I was travelling on Route 23 when suddenly out of nowhere some dude knocked me with a baseball bat. I crashed and was rendered unconscious.September 23 - So I woke up and from the road there were a bunch of dudes on motorcycle whacking each other so I decided to take the 'off road'. I trekked through the mountains to reach my goal and I reached the next town.To be continued...I have played a similar game on the PSX a decade before. It's a racing game about polygon bashing each other before reaching the goal.Now fast track to 2015.Honestly there's not much of this type of game on Steam so it's a total bliss to see this game here. Instead of polygons, we now have a realistic dudes bashing each other while keeping your motorcycle stable and avoiding traffic.To be continued...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I want this game to be good, but right now I can't recommend.  First the physics kinda suck.  The bikes have too much grip; theres usually not a reason to let up off the gas in a turn which is not how motorcycles work.  Flat out on the gas the whole race isnt racing at all and it degenterates this game into just another hussle for turbo, which then becomes the only reason to actually fight another racer.  You dont have to hold off your pole position like in Road Rash if you can turbo hop from one random spawned un-ranked racer to the next.  Which gets boring quick.  Also lame when a mob of un ranked, like not in any place 1st-15th, all hit you at once and the games over.  And all your stuffs gone.  No bike upgrades except for one skill that doesnt really feel like it does anything.  The Semi is a cool idea but its broken, goes way to fast and then consistently runs you over after you defeat it.  Also theres to many times where hiting a car or telephone pole head on just stops you or instantly makes you travel in reverse without falling off the bike.  All the bikes feel about the same, they just change the difficulty.  Which I don't like.  There shouldnt be a difficulty.  It should be about racing and fighting/positioning skills, getting money to get better weapons and bikes so you can win those harder races.  You cant steal weapons which was one of the best things about the original road rash games.  You just pick it up automatically after you kill the person that had it.  I WANT to have that crowbar that I stole from Jorg in the second race.  It has sentimental value.  Also the AI dont get vindictive like they would in Road Rash. The penalty for death is to high, I cant choose the level I go next, The bikes make no noise, theres NO PEDESTRIANS to run over or cross traffic. Just ... Just make it like Road Rash.  Take out the counters, weapon durability, how kicks make you completely stunned instead of forcing your to try to regain control, Fix the Physics so you actually have to race, maybe make traction loss a thing, and take out turbo except on maybe the last 3 bikes.  Also the weapon system is kinda lame. I die all the time trying to switch weapons, because to do so requires you to take your thumb off the steering.  Shootings is meh... Needs to be easier to switch weapons or shoot to the side.Oh another thing.  Study the actuall bike market right now, particularly the technology that exists, like traction control, electronic variable susspension, sproket changes, tire compound...Every bike enthusiast I know is a gear head and if you can't drool over that next upgrade theres no incentive.  I want to save up the 20k to buy that BMW S1000 HR or w/e if is with the traction and suspension control that basically handles everything about cornering except braking an leaning.  I don't like racing just for XP  points.I had high hopes for this, but as it stands, I really regret my purchase.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								If you are a fan of Road Rash, you will be... mildly intrigued by this game.It is indeed a violent motorcycle racing game, although campaign missions are divided into three types: a race where you need to come in 3rd or better, a timed run where you need to beat the clock to the finish line, or a catch-up to and destroy mission where you have a number of opponents to eliminate before they reach the escape point.This is a frenetic game, and that's somewhat the problem. There's too much to keep track of at any given moment. Are you looking down to check if you've got your sword equipped (gives you bonus decapitation points for a kill) or your club (better against enemies with helmets)? Oops, your enemy just got in two hits. Aiming your weapon to hit a target? Oops, you just rear-ended a slow-moving vehicle. Trying to swing your club to hit an enemy? Oops, you just went off the road. At any given moment, at least three different parts of the screen will be clamoring for your attention.There are other problems. For one thing, you may get a little health regeneration if you kill an enemy, but there's a noticeable delay in you receiving that boost. Meaning if you are near-death and were depending on that boost to get you through your next encounter, you may get clubbed to death before it's awarded to you. The progress indicator for how far along you are is next to useless. It once showed me basically neck-and-neck with an enemy at the halfway point, but I didn't finally see the enemy on the road until about the last quarter of the race. This is especially enfuriating on the catch-and-destroy missions, because enemies will usually start staggered, with the last necessary target usually having a near-half distance lead on you. If you haven't caught up by the last quarter of the race, they'll essentially have won.Enemies are one problem. They are amazing. They rarely make mistakes, the most common of which is to rear-end a slow-moving vehicle. But oncoming traffic is usually no problem for them, I've seen enemies on motorcycles smash through oncoming cars as though they were a sheet of paper. Meanwhile, I go flying if a car so much as looks at me the wrong way. Not surprising, since enemies behave like bricks; if they slam into you, they can push you in the direction they want, whereas they're impervious to your efforts to do the same. Kick an enemy off the track? I've seen them come flying back onto it as though they were Superman. Meanwhile, you'll do everything in your power to retain control and pray the game doesn't decide you've been crashed. Worst of all, they can speed up with no apparent cost, especially bad when using C4. Think you can just place it and speed away (assuming you get your nitro to fire correctly on the first try)? Think again, they'll be back behind you just before the timer ticks down, sending you flying. The ""best"" strategy I've found with C4 is to place it and drop back, but this costs you since you'll have had to slow down and thus lose ground on opponents further up the road.Crashing is also bad. The game is too long in deciding to crash you in hopeless situations and too quick to crash you in recoverable ones. I've floated over vast chasms with no hope of recovery waiting to be ragdolled as precious seconds are burned and my target gets away whereas I've been instantly ragdolled for going too far down a ridge I know I could skirt along to get back onto the road.This is also the only game where I've actively attempted to kill my allies because it's more helpful. Allies attempt to flank you protectively, but in practice, they often ram you into obstacles that you could otherwise have avoided (and you can't outpace them). They'll surround your enemies, meaning you'll have to pull your shots or hits if you want to preserve them (I've just taken to firing at whatever, and if an ally dies, thank god). I spent a good last quarter of a race just kicking them away from my bike whenever they got close.Also, money earned at the end of a race seems to have little correlation with the money the game records you earning throughout the race.There's some good stuff here with a persistent upgrade system, a frenetic pace, and a variety of weaponry to play with. But if you prefer your racing and fighting games to rely more on skill than luck, you're better off waiting for improvements.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Really want to like this, as I loved Road Rash and the core gameplay here is fun. However, lack of online coop, some really ill-considered mission goal types, and overall HUGE performance issues make this unplayable. On an i7-4790K 4ghz / 32GB RAM / GTX970 system it stutters and hitches any time I come within close proximity to other riders, even with resolution set to the minimum available and all graphics options turned all the way down. Ridiculous. I tolerated this during the early prerelease period and played through it because I wanted to love this thing, but the fact that it hasn't been remedied so close to the release date seems to demonstrate the issues are unfixable and related to Unity or beyond the developer's ability to mend.

								If you're looking to satisfy a Road Rash craving, this will do the trick. If you don't know what Road Rash is, it's kind of like a racing game with beat em up elements. This game offers some rouge-like elements, the levels are a little random, and when you die, it's over, but you earn perks for your next run. The perks are very minor, Road Redemption is still a racing beat em up, not a grindy rpg.Unlike many other games in early access, I have seen this game continue to grow and update. The game lacks a few things, some new modes might be nice. More diverse AI would add a lot, they seem to all act pretty much the same way. While some randomization is great, as it adds replay value, there is just too much. Knocking a biker off feels like killing a random monster in a mmo, another will just spawn and take its place. There are no grudges, or personalities, and often riders who have nothing to do with your current race will try to attack you for no reason.Most importantly, despite its few flaws, it's a fun game. It runs well, the screen shots and videos accurately depict the graphics. I have not had the game crash, slow down, or had any noticeable bugs. I feel the game is worth it at full price, and I expect it to continue to get better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's hilarious.And there's something quite amazing about the soundtrack.  Nostalgic at times.Buy temporary perks with $$ that last throughout your life.  When you finally DIE, you'll buy permanent perks with XP.  (traveling across the country NFS The Run style)  The have worked on the handling in recent updates.  Feels just right.

								In one word:  Outstanding.  This game is three things: exciting, hilarious and addictive.  It is exciting because, while playing this game the first few minutes, I literally had butterflies in my stomach: the kind you get when you're actually driving in real life at unsafe speeds.Its hilarious because you have the option of bludgeoning people with unusual weapons such as battle axes, and the like, which I find to be very humerous.Lastly it is clearly addictive because I basically said ""F work"" for half a week and just played this game from dawn to dusk three days in a row.Finished or not, I absolutely 100% recommend you try this game.

								I grew up playing the ever living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of Road Rash, and this game is looking very promising! The game is currently being developed and you should definitely keep that in mind if you consider purchasing. The game, so far, is not a finished game. That doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it in early access, it just means you should know what to expect. Right now the devs promise a 10-15 hour experience, and that is precisely what they deliver. 10-15 hours of sheer fun is to be had racing, slicing, bashing and shooting opponents with anything from pipewrenches to medieval axes, to handguns to grenade launchers. Nothing says ♥♥♥♥ you like Father Christmas bashing someone's head in with a giant candy cane. The game is not without its flaws, though. As is, the levels get rather stale after a while, there is hardly any diversity in bikes and riders, the music is not as iconic as the original Road Rash, the skill tree is very lineair, boring, and doesn't allow for experimentation, and the buyable in-campaign upgrades are 50% ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t filler stuff.I'm sure a lot of that will be adressed by the devs before the game is released. I think the game is great so far, and does the original Road Rash justice. I've had a blast, and I know you will too. I'm eagerly awaiting how this game will turn out. In the mean time, just enjoy the ride!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								At this point in time (2/18/16) the game is still in its Early Access phase, and I've tried to not review it until total completion, but I've had it in my library long enough and have played it enough times to be confident that my opinion of it will not change in any notable way for the worse. That being said, it's crazy-stupid-awesome how fun this game is. As it stands in its development, there is no story to speak of, which includes dialogue, cutscene's or character names (with the exception of a handful of extra-powered baddies). And as someone who usually finds story-telling and character-development a very important part of the games he plays, I couldn't care less. You drive down long highways on a motorcycle and kill rivals with an assortment of guns, swords, and blunt objects. Not to mention sticky packs of C4 charges. The continuous swarm of enemies that seem to be procedurally spawned (though I don't know for certain) make it unlikely you'll every run out of things to hit, or things to hit with. Though if you do, you can always kick at their wheels or grab them and steer them into oncoming traffic. But what makes the game endearing is the immensly satisfying instant gratification of the gameplay; you never hear people in the arcade playing House of the Dead complain about where all these monsters came from or who the main villain is because it doesn't make it any more fun to continuously blast zombies in the head.But what if you're no good? Like, not at ALL? It barely matters. The system of upgrades, which utilizes both ""use this til you die"" items as well as ""You're dead now? Tune up your bike and try again"" items ensures that even an embarrassingly awful defeat at the hands of a sub boss in the second level will still give you a slightly better chance next time.I've been playing this title since shortly after its release to the Steam community, and I have not once regretted the decision. The easy-to-pickup nature of the best arcade racing games, touch of self-aware humor of GTA3, and the immensely satisfying carnage of Twisted Metal 2 make Road Redemption a title you're sure to come back to over and over again. If you don't already have a game in your library for instant catharsis, Road Redemption is as good a suggestion as any.A billion stars (out of a billion and six).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Got this game because I need more driving combat games in my life. I'm not dissapointed. Well, not very.The sound design leaves something to be desired. Most of the bikes sound somewhat flat, and not what you'd expect them to sound like. The music was another thing. It got so repetitive that after about 2 campaign attempts, I shut it off and turned on my own.Combat itself is nice and crunchy. Guns leave a bit to be desired, as it jerks around your entire screen whenever you aim. A dead zone where it moves just the crosshair and not the screen might be nice, but it's just an idea.The maps/tracks are pretty good, but ""hallucinogenic chemical zones"" are incredibly annoying, to the point where I often quit out of a playthrough if one shows up. It would be nice if there was an option to disable them - I didn't find one.I understand it's early access, and will probably be changing this as the game updates. Can't wait to see what's in store.Overall, pretty good game, solid 6.5 out of 10. If you like bikes and swinging blunt objects at mutant future bikers, pick this up. Just maybe on sale though.

								I'm a big fan of the old Road Rash games,  and I must say this brings back all those awesome memories. Lots of fun arcade motorbike combat. No better feeling than slapping some c4 on an enemy and kicking him away to blow up a couple of his friends!Definitely recommond, looking forward to the final version!Small bug:Sometimes you get stuck on a sign, and cant reverse to get off of it.

								I've only had the game for a little while, but it's pretty fun. I'm not really familiar with the Road Rash series, but upon learning about it's general concept, and seeing this game, I decided to try it out. It's a pretty fun, fast paced game, and it's pretty challenging too. For the most part, I have no complaints.However, I do have 2, and they are pretty much the only sources of dislike for this game. The first is the physics and hit-detection. For example, when careening down the highway, say you hit a car head-on. Most times, as expected, you'll go flying off your bike. However, sometimes, you'll instead be pushed by the car while still on your bike, and you won't be able to move until it knocks you off your bike. This same scenario can happen if a car or truck hits you from behind, or if you hit a random pipe or box in the road or on the side. You'll be stuck, and you can't move, unless you manage to shimmy out of the scenario. In a fast-paced game like this one, no matter how good you drive, one mistake can mean the difference between success and failure.The other has to do with damage (and enemy hit detection), which I find wildly inconsistent. For example, I can be going at it with a rival biker, and our weapons clash against each other. For some reason, I'll still take damage, even though a) the enemy doesn't, and b) the enemy weapon hit my weapon, not my body. Also, there have been plenty of times where I can be hit with a pipe and even with max health, instantly be killed, while I can be hit by c4 and only lose half of my life. It seems like no matter how much life you have, with the inconsistent damage, you can truly feel safe on the road.Regardless, even with those bugs, the game is still worth it. It's a very challenging game, but if you can overcome, you'll be handsomely rewarded. In it's current state, 7/10 for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								*I am going back to thumbs up on this game again. As I've recently discovered that they are planning and working towards many of the additions and improvments on many of the things I've addressed below.*It's gotta lotta potential. You can't go wrong with riding bikes and beating the living entrails out of law enforcement and other rivals on the road. There is no story to the game at all. (YET at least) No characters to identify with. The rival gangs have names but no identities. You can't pick and choose what kind of person or what kind of sex your person is. Other than skills, there is no customization options. Menus and interface are not terrible but need some work. Also don't like how you loose your skill points if you don't use them. There don't seem to be any checkpoints anywhere between races in the game... once you die its all they way back you go. VERY annoying. Visuals are decent but not top notch. HOWEVER I've noticed significant improvements recently in both graphics and performance. Gameplay and contoller support still leave a little to be desired. It's particularly difficult to aim firearms and keep control of the bike. I'd like to see them tweek that part of the mayhem a tad. But the punching, kicking, piping, batting, and shoveling (yes SHOVELING) are spot on and tons of fun.One thing the game ISN'T is boring! And that's all that really matters. So I'm looking forward to seeing how things evolve.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Ok, good things first, the campaign is challenging and the different events are giving you some variety, the gameplay is easy to learn and works great, the combat system is well made as well, furthermore it is nice to find a game these days that's supporting splitscreen multiplayer.Now for the parts I was slightly disappointed in, the allies that are found in some levels are often more of a hindrance than a help, next is that many people described this game as the new Road Rash, which it basically is, yet it is missing some things, that I adored about the old game, the amount of bikes is mediocre at best, 8 bikes are available while 2 each have the same stats and they are all about equally good so there is no progress to be made in that point, next is that I missed the dark humour from Road Rash as well as the caricatural pictures in the loading screens and menus, even though I can't really make the developers accountable for these expectations, I thought that I should mention this.All in all I'd give it a 9/10.

								Fantastic game, it is addictive and really enjoyable. All whilst still being easy to master and do well in. Also, the updates are coming quite fast now after they switched to the Unity engine. The game's great joy, for me, is that it doesn't take that long to have fun and you can easily just finish it and go about your business. I especially enjoy it as it is somehow a remake of an old game that I played when I was a child, which makes it something special. All that, with a cool development team that listens and what to please the majority of people. I would recommend this game and rate it at least a 9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I hesitantly recommend this game. Ultimately it's fun, and it'll give you a (somewhat) modern(ish) version of road rash. But be warned that it does lack a certain level of polish, and is a definite sale-purchase.In terms of presentation, graphics and audio, you're looking at something (very) comparible to FlatOut 2 (2006). As it's an arcade style racer (sort of) it kind of gets away with it, but it is a shame. Nobody is looking for Assetto Corsa level of fidelity, but a half decent soundtrack and a UI that wasn't pulled from a Robot Wars DVD menu would be nice.But it's fun. It's a fun game.

								It's a great throwback to the old Road Rash series of games that I first enjoyed on the 3DO.  I'm a big fan of Road Redemption as it is right now, and I've played through the current campaign and NG+ modes.  The variety of levels is enjoyable, and the way they have designed a seperation between permanent skills and play-through purchases feels good.  However, the controls can feel a little unforgiving at times, and once you've played the limited number of modes there's not much more to experience other than slightly different maps, and varying degrees of difficulty.  I'm looking forward to seeing this game improve and get more content. I wouldn't have purchased it at full price for where it at's currently, but I got it at 50% off and feel like that was about right for the time I've spent going through the content.

Road Rash RecreatedThis game takes me back to my childhood. 6 years old 1999, playing on my Playstation inside on a rainy summer day. Playing road rash without a clue on what to do but race, always getting hit and purposly getting caught by cops just to watch the funny video clips.This games is on the same wavelength as Road Rash, fun fast races with comedy in mind. Every fancy racing across rooftops as santa with a katana? This is the game.The graphics are superb, you feel the curvature of every corner. Y'know what,  im just gonna stop this review. Why? Well basically:If you want a great racing game, if you want to murder people as Santa on a bike.

Even in Early Access is pretty solid, performance on Linux are pretty good and the only issue is that xbox 360 controller triggers are not working as expected (i run antimicro to use my controller on RR). I hope the devs fix it, it's not game breaking though so if you play with keyboard and mouse everything works.Recommended 3 times!

								Right off the bat, this game is really fun, and I want to see it achieve the perfection that Road Rash had years ago. That being said, there are a few problems that prevent me from fully enjoying the game. Nothing against the devs though, it is early access afterall. So this is more of a ""Heres what I think should be fixed list"". If you are unsure if you will like the game, watch the trailer again.1. Hitting roadside objects and cars rarely knocks me off my bike. Instead I stop dead in my tracks and get stuck for several seconds like driving into a corner in Mario Kart 64.2. Some roadside objects have very bad hitboxes. In the desert level (first one in quick play), if you hit the large piles of rocks, you can stop dead in your tracks several feet away, drive up the rocks while hovering over them, and get stuck in mid-air.3. Without using the quick turn key, turning is far too slow. It almost rewards having the key constantly held down. Maybe have better handling normally and sharper turns to use the quick turn key?4. This one's completely subjective, but maybe you could have the option to have Road Rash style crashes. Then you would skid to a stop and tumble, just to get back up and walk to your bike. It always seemed like a more memorable gameplay feature to me.Anyway, I really look forward to playing this game more, and I hope that some of these issues are addressed in a future update. Honestly, I have wanted a game like this ever since RR on the Saturn, and this is a great attempt at such a game. Now if only we could get a new F-Zero game...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Road Rash was the only racing game I ever enjoyed as a kid, and this feels like an updated version of that. There are new additions to the concept but ultimately you still get to fight people on motorcycles, which is a unique experience in video games. Campaign mode feels like an arcade game in the sense that you can't save your progress, only beat the game or lose. However, you do get to purchase upgrades that help you in future playthroughs.

								It's been a few months since I've played this, but it didn't even take an hour until I was in the zone (a blood soaked zen), having fun, and achieving something. I backed the Kickstarter for this. Even though it's not finished yet, Road Redemption, as it is today, is everything I hoped it would be.I loved gritty vehicular combat games growing up (not cute stuff like Mario cart). This presses all the right buttons. I even have an old PC with Road Rash installed (among other games), and Road Redemption is better in every way, even with my rose tinted notalgia glasses on. I like that there are biker gangs (and that you're in one), and the variety of enemies, weapons, game modes, and locations. The roof tops aren't as intimidating as they are at first.Now if I can only do everything AND pay attention to oncoming traffic... guess I just need to ""git gud"".			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								They said ""go East"".  East is salvation, east is peace...east is your only hope.So east I went.  I managed to find a few other believers to tag along with me...we knew the open road was dangerous, but we had no idea what we were in for.Billy got it first.  Another gang crept up on us.  He didn't stand a chance.  The last thing I saw was Billy and this savage throwing kicks at each other.  I could see that the man was holding a tire iron.  Above the wind, dust, and scraping metal, I yelled to Billy to watch out...but it wasn't the tire iron that did him in.  An oncoming car took both of them out.  One second he was there, in front of me, desperately fighting to survive.  Then, he was gone...a fleshy tumbleweed leaving a puddle of blood every time he touched the ground.East wasn't salvation...east was death.  And I embraced it.  Guns, pipes, bats.  You name it, I've split a skull with it.  I don't know how much further I have to go, but I don't care.  I no longer live for a better world...I live for a perfectly executed kick to send my next mark off a suspension bridge.This is my life now.  The blood, the sweat, the smell of gasoline before it explodes.  I will have my revenge...and I will keep going.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								For me, this game is a lot of fun and has much to offer in terms of gameplay.  When multiplayer is introduced I am sure it will enhance the game's wider appeal enormously.  Ignore the member berry-eating♥♥♥♥♥♥♥complaining that the game isn't an exact duplicate of their beloved Road Rash.  The developers have introduced this game as its spiritual successor and like I said, it's fun. Kicking opponents off bridges/into oncoming traffic, using rocket packs, having a huge variety of weapons at your disposal is just great in single player - Multiplayer has the potential to be awesome.This is a game where it's possible to get good fairly quickly - I found the guns to be difficult to use initially but they're so easy now.Highly recommended.

								A really funny game to play with some friends in local coop, includes: speed, weapons, cool accidents and concentrated doses of anger ready to be used with your buddies.Mainly the game is about not crashing with everything and kick some butts with baseball bats and pipe tubes. Missions are about racing and fighting against bad dudes or eliminate some determinated number of bad guys.If you wanna play it alone, loses a big part of the fun. Still a nice game to expend some minutes here and there if you are not in mood to play some typical AAA title.In my opinion the worst thing right now is the performance at split screen, low fps at my i7 + GTX 780.*7/10          Could be a really cool multiplayer game if the developers continue with his nice job.

								9/10 - would highly recommend. Some bugs to still be worked out, and I dislike the rooftop level, but this is how Call Of Duty should be - fast paced, fun, and violent. You soon learn to avoid slamming into things and using kicks to your advantage. The list of improvements I'd suggest> more levels (and perhaps a re-jig of current levels)> some more music (can we have more like ""Gangsters""?)> more character models wouldn't go amiss - there aren't any female character models> basic tutorial> make the bikes turn better at slow speed - surviving a crash is one thing, having to spend another half a mile to get back on the track is another.

								I purchased this game when it first entered early access. It was promising at the time but they have made some odd decisions. It fails to convey the feeling of speed necessary for a Road Rash type of feel. They also chose to focus on battle rather than racing. I've had this game a long time and I loved RR but I've put 3 and a half hours into this during that time. It's not very exciting and the enemies just keep showing up in the distance then you choose what to hit them with. The rooftop races are a good example of odd decisions. Motorcycles have no place there. You can't lean forward of back on the bikes to gain speed. There is no feedback when you go into turns or anything like you would want from a motorcycle. Progressing to new bikes isn't exciting for these reasons. If you like hitting other people on motorcycles with objects this is a pretty good game. That's pretty much what you are going to get. Whack a mole on motorcycles. The soundtrack is really bad it is one of the worst. If there was a Steam award for worst soundtrack I would have voted it instantly. I hate to write a negative review on this game. It just feels like what the customer desired and what is being delivered are completely different things. No hard feelings, but I really wanted a racing game with motorcycles more than just hitting one thing after another.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I had purchased this game very close to when it first started out in EA. I have one thing to say to those that are always griping about something being in EA for ""too long"" according to their expert opinions:""♥♥♥♥♥♥off""There is a reason the release date is there. Yes, it has been three years, can you do better? Short answer is probably not. If you're looking for an arcade style game that is about FUN and less about reality, then you're looking in the right place. Yes, the game can get a bit repetitive in places, what game doesn't? Players of any card game will tell you the same thing. Players of any sports game will tell you the same thing. Players of almost ANY game will tell you the SAME. DAMN. THING. Stop bandying it as your reason for a thumbs down. Get creative.Moving along, there are many reasons I would like to see the devs finish this game and give all of the nay sayers that swift foot to the mouth of their own accord syndrome. From the outset, the game is fun, the controls can be a bit squirrely to get used to but, it's not out of your hands to improve. This game can have you brake at times. I know, I know, difficult to believe that you can decelerate to actually improve control and ultimately stay running with your opponents. Who would have thought it's not as simple as step on the gas for the whole of the ""race""? As for the cars raining from the sky? BRILLIANT! I see no reason as to why this game (or so many others) have to adhere to the ""it looks like something from the real world, so it has to apply to its rules or die"" mentality.Keep up the good work, devs. Some of us appreciate your hard work, rather than using it as a stepping point for a paltry attempt at attention. Others, they already know what they can do.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								One of my favorite games growing up was Road Rash 64. Since then, I've longed for something similar to play. Needless to say, I was excited when I found out about Road Redemption.The main campaign has 12 levels. The object of each level varies. Some will be a normal race, others will be about eliminating others by knocking them off of their bikes. There's also different environments for these levels. Some take place in a desert, others in the snow and some on top of rooftops. There's an upgrade system in the game as well. As you beat levels in the campaign, you gain XP. You can use the XP to get upgrades which will make things easier for you. You'll likely obtain all of the upgrades in a short period of time, but it's still nice to have. One thing I don't like about it this game is the rubber banding. It seems to be a bit much, sometimes to the point of feeling unfair. Hopefully they fix that or at least improve it.Thus far, I've put in 20+ hours, beaten the game multiple times and unlocked every achievement. This is one of those games you can play for hours while watching a marathon of your favorite TV show. If you're a fan of Road Rash, I'd recommend checking this out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I bought this game because I need a game that can remind me to my childhood. But I see bright future in this game.

								Most of Early Access is garbage. Either the designs are poor, the funding is clearly lacking and it will never be completed, or they're simply not fun to pay. There's usually a reason a developer can't find a publisher.Not so with Road Redemption. I'm stunned this hasn't been picked up by a publisher already. The visuals are solid, the gameplay is hilarious and bombastic, the weapons and tracks are diverse, interesting and feel excellent to use. Most of all, this is a ♥♥♥♥ing VIDEO GAME. It's such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ video game you don't even know - it's just a freaking blast to play, a huge amount of fun. The upcoming multiplayer component is extremely promising as well. The only thing lacking might be the music, which is somewhat generic, as well as some variability in the missions. However, the devs seem to have their heads screwed on right and this promises to be a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome game.Give them your money, now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Been waiting so long for a game like Road Rash and finally came across one! this holds up to the promise which the original Road Rage had back in the day but only with better graphics, gameplay and of course soundtrack. There are some really great abrupt WTF funny moments when you get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked by an opponent or vice versa. There are some minor performance bugs which I am sure the devs are taking care of. Could really use some good rider skins though.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for Road Rash fans!!Oh and The controller support is excellent too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is my first Impression and a ALPHA Feedback.Ill update it here and then ;)Ive needed about a Hour to get into the game, had some trouble to understand what exaclty i ahve to do now, but i think thats different for everyone. The Performance on my System is good, i play it on VeryGood and have no Frameproblems.The Soundbugs are fixed for the moment, lets wait to get more Options to balance the sound. i think the music is too loud atm.And in my opinion there should be a skill level, if youre not fast into the game, its hard to beat some missions with timer.Will update the feedback with the development of the game ;)tbh, iam the kind of person who playd hundrets of hours on RoadRash when i was a kid. there havent been any kind of game like RR and now there is one. Thats a thing to say ""thank you"" and i hope i get some of the old feelings back, theres no need to be the same, but some of good old memorys ^^			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Generally okay, plays a lot like Road Rash. Couple of nits though. First, the rubberbanding is really strong, to the point where AI riders will blast up and by you at seemingly-supersonic speeds just to continue a battle the game thinks you should be having. Second, the firearms feel clumsy as hell (to use them you have to rotate the camera away from where you're going), but the AI is able to fire a full 360 degrees with no issues -- this feels kind of unfair, considering there are missions where all hostile riders are equipped with firearms. Still, minor issues, and single races are still enjoyable enough.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Road Redemption gets a lot of comparisons to Road Rash, and with good reason - they both feature guys on motorcycles racing through various landscapes and beating and shooting each other with a myriad of weapons. However, at this point, I believe the game has surpassed Road Rash. There are more weapons, more types of races, more variety in locations. The music is great, mostly heavy metal - perfect for this game. I've played through the campaign and campaign+ -- just recently both in one night. You have to play through the game all at once, except for several savepoints you can earn through ""experience"" - there are 20 missions currently including the bonus level after the credits - which can be difficult, but it makes sense considering the game. The game is just about perfect now, I'd say. I highly recommend Road Redemption.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								There's a lot of justified fear about early access games. This is the counterpoint. I got this a while back for maybe $12-$15, and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥has the developer been hard at it. The game was already fun, but now there's a proper quick play mode, the campaign is much bigger, the skill tree has been expanded, and you can be Santa Claus if you want. Clearly this is a developer that wants to EARN that early access money. Back when there were more bugs and the game was just a lot less polished he was updating literally every day to fine tune things or send out whatever bugfixes were available. Also the game is fun. I'm not usually too big on racing games, but this one lets me punish the (former) leader with a lead pipe. Sometimes it rains cars, somtimes you're screaming across the rooftops and kicking your opponents off of them. There's a good variety of modes and enough race tracks to keep me happy. If you fondly remember Road Rash, you should definitely check this out. If you don't know what Road Rash is, check this out and you'll get a good idea.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game sucks! Hold on, WAIT! In a good way... Please allow me to explain oh great master race... You, are a biker. Back in your day there was talk of a competition on the long and winding roads of America. Your grandfather who was one of the few who had done it years back when the roads were digitalized and coded for what seemed to be a Nintendo game. It was BRUTAL back in his day. Seeing him now you know he had taken a few pipes to the face, chain scars on his legs and a still healing ribcage from all the kicks he had to indure.But now its your turn. Your turn make him proud. He was knocked off, and lost all he got in that ROAD RASH of old. Now its your turn to get redemption, ROAD REDEMPTION!(Crowd Cheers)(TL:DR)No, but this IS a fun game. I had a N64 and played Roadrash a lot. Feels like that! I am waiting for the multiplayer and release to really tell people about this game only because to me it is unfinished, but still has all the hard hitting and s*** tun of blunt force trauma with different weapons. Guns also were thrown in for a bit of OP fun. Don't buy it if you are unsure though, just watch a video or two online before your final verdict.Thanks for reading! Now go the hell away!

								I bought this while on sale for $8.  I would gladly buy again at full price.  Playing local coop with my daugther thirty minutes into the game (almost 10) she was say that this is one of the best games ever.  Not sure about that part yet but it certainly is a fun game and has the makings to be a very good game with further love and development by the developers.  It was certainly even with only an hour spent so far worth the money.   Is it rough around the edges?  Very.  Graphically it isn't anything to write home about.  Sound wise I can't say as we didn't have the sound playing.  I am not much on sound effects anyway so I usually am not big on reviewing that side of games.  I love soundtracks but only when I am playing OST burnt to CDs in my car.  Anyway to me this type of game is all about is it fun.  This isn't a game that is meant to be complex looking so the graphics really aren't that big of deal to me.  They are smooth for the most part so that is what I care about.  There are a few clipping issues that I am sure will get worked out.  Texture wise this isn't meant to be a game you are going to stop and look at the roses anyway.     Control wise I played via keyboard and my daughter via offical 360 controller.  We have a second 360 contoller but I was too lazy to hook up so I am going on her word about the contoller controls but she didn't seem to have any real problems with them.   The keyboard controls using the default WASD/Keyboard controls were fair but had some drift in them.  I am sure the developers will tighten up the controls as game development goes along so I am not too worried about that.   However contol in this type of game is one of the bigger issues worth looking at so if you are wondering as far as July 5th, 2015 at least as far as keyboard controls I can say that the bikes do control a ""floaty"" that I would like.   Once again this is a EA title and I am sure this will  change.   As far as overall game concept this game follows along with the old Road Rash feel and that is perfect for me.  The game is FUN.  Is it perfect, nope.  Was I expecting it to be at this point, nope.   Do I think it has the chance to become a great game, yes.  At this point in development do I feel like it is worth risking the full asking price of $20?  Yes if you played Road Rash or looking for a fun game that doesn't take itself too serious then I do.   The game doesn't have a lot of ""meat"" in it yet but even so what is on the bones so far is worth the money.  I have spent a lot more for a lot less fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A few notes: 1) Lags a bit on the menus on MacBook Air 2014 (yes I game on a mac, F*** You);2) Handling is someething that takes getting used to;3) Still need to get into the campaign, which ended once I died,so that's a bit annoying.All in All, great game.

								I keep telling myself I won't invest in any more Early Access titles, yet here I am. I remember trading my SNES for my friend's Genesis a lot of weekends in Jr. High, and the Road Rash series was one of the biggest reasons. This game takes the timeless concept of armed crazies on motorcycles racing on public roads for fame and fortune to another level. Probably the biggest upgrade, online multiplayer, isn't implemented yet, but what is here now is already as fun as the original games. What's already been added to the original schematic is local multiplayer, rooftop levels, ""hallucinatory"" levels with cars falling from the sky and crashing into each other at every turn, awesome avatars with flaming jack-o-lantern heads, and a permanent experience based upgrade path on top of the cash upgrades that dissapear after each game ends.  I definitely don't regret this purchase.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I'm a little mixed on this. I recommend it because it's still in early access and has some work to do, but the game as a final product in it's current state feels absolutely generic. If within a year it hasn't progressed, I'll gave to give this a pass.The game is a ton of fun. It's Road Rash, motorcycle racing game mixed with a beat-em-up game. They changed some things up to make it a little more interesting. There's a skill tree. You can die, which requires you to start all the way over. You can shoot people and change out weapons during a race. There's also crazy drug races where cars are just flying all over the place.The biggest complaint I have is that the actually racing and feel to the bikes are way off. There's little regard to real physics not gravity in the game. The races use a rubber band method to attach each other side-by-side so you easy bust face with bat. And while that's fine, Road Rash was always a blast because you're have to maintain your speed to side-by-side. It never just locked you into that place to attack.My overall recommendation is to wait this one out until it's final, unless you see a cheap deal.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								For all you old folks, think of moderinzed Road Rash for the most part.  It is a bit more fast paced than Road Rash and isn't the most beautiful game, but the gameplay is a blast and I find myself playing much longer than I plan to each time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Road Redemption is memorable to me because it was the first game that was given to me by a developer to review, presumably because they had mistaken me for somebody important. I decided to go back and play it again recently because I remembered it being pretty fun, and then saw that I forgot to ever actually write anything about it, which is probably why the only other developer who ever gave me a game to review was the one who made that Hat Man game that I gave a bad review for. But on to Road Redemption. Road Redemption is a fun little game with equal emphasis on racing and combat, in which you try to survive your way through a trail of races and eliminations. You gain both cash and XP as you progress, but if you die then it's game over, and you restart from the beginning with only your XP upgrades carried over. The combat is pretty fun and fleshed out; you can grab other racers and steer them into oncoming traffic, kick them off bridges, shoot them, or just get in with a battle axe or a lead pipe and bash and counter your way to victory. Road Redemption is a game where ""1st place"" can either mean ""stay ahead of the other racers"" or ""be the only racer left"", and I appreciate that since I'm not much of a racer but I am much of a person who likes to hit other people with shovels. I first played the game over a year ago and it's still getting regular updates, adding lots of small features and changes that weren't in when I first played, but it is also still missing online multiplayer, which makes the $20 price tag a bit steep. It's apparently only going up in price after it leaves Early Access, though, and the current singleplayer content is still pretty fun, so if you're interested in the concept you may want to just take the gamble and buy it on sale now for the multiplayer later.

								It’s very satisfying to systematically murder every other racer. There is a special kind of rush when your enemies stay down. Road Redemption remembers everything road rash did right and brings it back with smoother gameplay. However it seems to be stuck in perpetual open beta like so many others. Unlike many of the others however, it feels for the most part a complete game and is often receiving small updates.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								If you loved the 90's game Road Rash which came out on the Sega Megadrive then you will find this game quite enjoyable. It is no where near the acheivement that Road Rash was but with this being early access I am hoping it can get closer to it. Currently it is not worth the price tag. There is no where near enough content to keep you going longer than a few hours. The races are short which can be irritating if you fall off near the as you will not have enough time to catch up, they are quite often extremely hectic and it is primarily luck that ensures you get through it. There can be bombs exploding, cars flying everywhere, cars swerving all over the road and occasionally cars that fall from the sky in the aptly titled halucineagenic zone.  There are two lots of upgrades, temporary ones which last for as long as you are alive and are bought with cash won from races and ones you buy once dead with the XP you have earned whilst alive. This is quite fun but again not a patch on Road Rash. I would like to see shops in which to purchase new bikes and parts to upgrade the one you have and new outfits to buy and things like armour. The races need to be longer as you are just getting into them when they come to an end, an end which allows you to carry on riding until the gane loads. I would like to see something of a story too, not anything dramatic like Grandma needs a new hip but doesn't have insurance so I race to pay for it kinda crap but just yes we race it's what we do. In Road Rash there was characters I didn't want to fight with as they always said nice things to me and there were jerks you didn't mind repeatedly bashing. Something like that is always fun. And dear god please lose the Mariocart level, currently the last level, riding on a rainbow in space? Come on, you lost me there.In summary this is a fun game and a good way to waste some spare minutes but so far the content is lacking and the races are too short. But otherwise an enjoyable experience, unfotunately not worth the current price tag.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								At the start it's kind of agravating sure. But as things go on things get easier, as one may expect. Though, enemy health gets kind of rediculaus. Doesn't mean you can't handle them, either by blocking of ♥♥♥♥ing kicking them into a car or off a cliff. Really fun to do.But for me, the real prize comes at the end of the early access. The last level as it stands at the time of this review, is mother ♥♥♥♥ing rainbow road. Complete with happy music and floating in the middle of a void. 10/10 would race to my death again.

								That game is great! I found out about this game a couple days ago, when I was looking up ""Road Rash"" on Steam, so I decided to try it out and I was really satisfied. The controls are good and it's so satisfying to beat the opponents off of their bikes. The game provides the feeling of speed/vertigo you would expect from a game like that as well as other feelings, like ""fiero"" and the joy of brutally overcoming adversity. On the other hand, I think the soundtrack needs some improvement and I wish PS4 controller support was already implemented. I would recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a good vehicular combat game or any Road Rash enthusiast. Big thumbs up![EDIT:] The PS4 controller is supported if you're using Steam Link, but the game sees it as a Xbox controller.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Okay so this game is kind of re-birth of Road Rash series which is made on unity, the game itself plays good and even betr than classic, but for now it lacks moar content (mostly cuz its one-run kind of game, so its okay).The devs are trying to make the game as good as possible, and i've deleted my prev. negative review claiming that achivs are broken and devs ignore this... now i know they don't so this game will be 100%able soon, for now - just ~56%.Graphics: Everything looks good, stuff explodes, and graphics don't eat too much resources. (10/10)Gameplay: It's fun even if you play it few more times, you can use either firearms or cold weapons, both are useful. You have a choice of bikes and stuff. (10/10)Setting: Gangs, bikes and stuff in different parts of USA, gud nuff. (9/10)Controls: everything is fine as well, but deflection doesn't work for now. (7/10)Story: <Do you need any here?>Replayability: Kinda high cuz its the main thing about this game, you get skills that carry over to next playthroughs so it can be easier. I immediately played this game again and then Campaign +, was kinda disapointed not getting an achievement tho :c (to be fixed) (10/10)Overall rating: 9.2/10 (S)The game is worth buying, but beware of that its not so long one, you might want to go for all achivs (once they are fixed), otherwise you will overpay cuz of low time spent.

								Road Redemption is a spiritual successor of the Road Rash Series. I have played only one Road Rash game before, which was on my Playstation. When I played Road Redemption for the first time, I really got that feeling that this is really a worthy follow up after the series, with modern graphics, physics, etc.In this early access version, you're gonna be playing the campaign mode which lasts 12 levels, not unlike a rogue like setup. You go from level to level with various objectives, got some temporary upgrades in between which will be gone when you die, and then get to buy some permanent upgrades like health, damage, etc. With my poor skills, it took me 4 hours to finally finish this early access portion.As for what you do in the game itself, there are race-type levels, take down, weird platforming level with a just-cause-y grappling hook, and a few other variations (like racing with cars raining from the sky). I have to say they really nail that feel when you hit enemies in the face. It's just so damn satisfying ! Kicking your enemy to make him crash a truck is even more fun, although a bit more difficult. There are also a few types of guns which makes your job of killing people very, very easy compared to hitting people directly in which you can take some damage. Maybe it'll be better if they nerf it a little. Nothing game breaking though.My two cents is that even though this is a very early access, I get the feeling that the final product is going to be epic. The developers are great and they patch the game almost everyday, sometimes twice a day, and are also active in the forum. I fully recommend this game for those of you who likes hitting people in the face (who doesn't ?).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Also, why not pull out a variety of guns and blast them off their ride as well.  This is a great racing/fighing game that can provide you with that particular road rash we are most familiar with.  Runs great with new content and fixes added all of the time.   Recommended, if you like the premise of this game then you will not be disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Mostly fun, with controller in hand ready to go this game plays well out of the box. We all know what game this reminds us older players of. Here we are in a different time to do it all again, better and brutal online. Im really looking forward to the coming year of updates to gauge the level invested by this Louisiana company.Features I find lacking or just bugs.- Poor leaning on the bike- No cat walks or stoppies- Double health skill carries to ng+ but starting level 3 & $1500 does not- Starting a race is always set up at paces from other bikes and based on distance, its possible to not start a race until you want there is no time limit just a bar telling you when you finish- Maybe add street races where you all have a starting line and the option to have a delay to use weapons- Buying from the store the double dmg for the next race is bs garbage, its a gamble. make it a xp skill- There is no proper way to quit after you finish a race and spend exp if youre not dead. - No proper brake, just forward and reverse. never puts leg down.- The check points between levels to buy stuff show have more random one type of item(e.g cb radio, +mass/kg but can hear chatter maybe learn a thing, chains as weapons, screwdrivers, mail boxes, a whip, road beers,♥♥♥♥♥♥jugs, etc)- More chatter between all motorists, gestures too. - Mission to get 4of 4 stars you have to drive slow before reaching the end. its a problem of too short of a distance. - Cash into exp store item should display the ratio of $:exp.- Disarming a rider does nothing but killing a guy nets you a weapon...kick a guy off a roof top much.- Hands not attached to the handle bars- The magnum hand gun is large compare to our players hand, compare it to the harpoon gun in size.- Why is it with a handgun equipped that three different buttons are used to fire a gun?- More race modes: Defeating mob bosses on bikes with gang in tow, Tsunami run where you stay ahead of the death hunting you down, Hallucinegenic Zone you have an ability to slow time(e.g Max Payne 3 online) allowing the rider to  duck and weave. - Intersections, over passes, on ramps off ramps. get those alt routes- Not enough variations, the style going is very spaced out 0_0- Steamworks or GTFOOverall 7, because there is only 7 levels and it plays very well. Its not even half way across to what appears the end. At this time the game is .827 in Early Access. I like the randomness and hope to see a roguelike story making choices. Im sure to spend many hours playing once multiplayer rolls upjuly 4 2015 - Alot has changed ng+ is tough and need to set yourself up to be able to compete so you dont die. basically if you barely beat a level and used all your boost you wont beat the next lvl. the new build look is nice, but it really shows how detailed it looks like a arcade cabinet game. There is still no multiplayer or bikes. Alot of fleshed out snags, power up attacks and more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A lot of fun, not much frustration for an early access game.I lacks polish, it lacks some rythm sometimes, like when you get back on the road, when you get off track without falling... Sure, a lot of content is missing I think, and I hope devs wil do some work on content, sounds, and a little bit of gameplay to allow more drivability.And remove guns, AI with gun is overpowered, and if you don't play with a mouse, precise weapons are unusable, unless for AI.

								Such a good nostalgic feeling along with some new amp'd up craziness. Campaign + adds some difficulty with insane explosions all the time, cars spawning from the sky and bursting into pieces on impact, crazed jet jumping across skyscrapers, and an endless amount of police cars and motorcyclists and rival gang members to bash you to hell along the way. Some glitches but it doesn't matter sometimes the game is more fun that way. With that said I would wait for this game to go on sale. It is definitely a lot of fun in both single player and multiplayer.

								I've put a fair amount of time into this game over the last three years. It was touted in their kickstarter as a spiritual successor to Road Rash. It is not. Road Rash was a great racing game with a good combat mechanic. This is a mediocre fighting game with an absurd ""racing"" mechanic. Racing being a loose term meaning an event involving moving vehicles that may be a race, or a deathmatch, or a ""see how angry you can make the cops"" game. Which may include the added ""fun"" of cars raining from the sky constantly. It's gone through a number of itterations, and the racing portion has been improved (IE: They made the raining cars bs a rare thing) but ultimately, the devs just don't seem to know what direction they were aiming for here. Either that or they were aiming for pure chaos.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								If you played and enjoyed Road Rash on the N64, you're gonna love this one.Shoot/grab/ram/whack enemies and avoid traffic. Pretty darn fun. The ragdoll physics makes for some hilarious accidents. There's still a lot I need to learn about the game regarding equipment purchases and what not but I'm enjoying the game. The maps are huge. One game I accidently trailed off the road and ended up just riding the mountains. I wasn't glitched out of the map or anything, I was just ridin all around. Kinda like an open world, just with me being so far away there weren't any other enemies/cars, etc.And while I've had fun with the gameplay, the music is great as well. Really feels like you're playing a ""classic"". The sounds and music give it a nice arcade feel. If you're bored with the games you have and just want to have goofy fun, I highly recommend this.

								So First off I really love roadrash, the idea of a more battle focused roadrash is awesome, but I feel the game developer is taking this game in the wrong direction. For example, 3 levels in your bike gets unlimited jet booster pack that propels your bike way high in the air, most of the maps take place on rooftops and are poorly designed and involve jump after jump and its just awful. maps where the entire road is laced with c4 bombs that are all timed to go off quite randomly or maps where cars are always falling from the sky, its neat and all but its in there way too much,out of the maps selection theres only about 2 that are any fun and you dont get to select the maps theyre all generated by the computer. The ones that are fun are super fun, I do love this game alot but honestly i find myself quitting campaigns over and over due to having to race on rooftops all the damn time. I'd like to see it stick to the road rash roots more, and less goofy crap, this game has the feel at time of a modern day road warrior at times and has potential to be amazingly fun.I know this game is early access and there will be alot of improvements i just hope they pour their resources into making more decent maps and less wacky over the top game killer but they seem dedicated to their stupid bike jet packI'd like this game alot better without the bike jet packs, without the rooftop platform jump levels, without the explosive road levels, without the cars falling from the sky levels, without the cartoonish rainbow level.

								I hope you guys realize the responsibility you took on with this. The nostalgia for many, the modern day solution to our lack of any Road Rash since N64. It's got the guts and the glory, but I do hope you stay true to the promise of MP which my bro in Chicago on his base, and me 800 miles away have been witing for. That aside, Road Redemption is legit. Gameplay, performance, it's like i'm back on a sega nomad almost.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								It's hard to write about a game in Early Access, but I'll give it a shot:Let me first start out by saying that I would highly recommend this game for those who love racing, but with a bit of violence. These games might incluede: Twisted Metal, Road Rash, Burnout series, and possibly Flatout.At it's core, the racing mechanics are there, but the aren't heavily influenced by anything other than get from point A to point B. It's more about the journey, not about the destination, and boy is this journey a hell of a lot of fun.Each mach has different demands: race, destroy, or sometimes you'll find just surviving is a demand in itself. There's just enough nuance in the game to really warrant a purchase. I actually just got off the phone with the developer (he seems like a really nice guy, and his phone number is actually in the game), and he's stated that they have a lot planned. Hopefully the racing portion become more of its own beast, but time will tell.I mentioned the journey, getting from point A to point B, and that's where the game shines with all sorts of carnage, explosions, and parrying. There's nothing quite as satisfying as the combat in this game. At it's core it's more a combat racer than it is one or the other, but it does have a heavier emphasis on combat. It's a blast, and co-op will be riot.That all being said, the game is difficult, like, extremely so; however, it's never to the point of irritation, but more to the point of, ""Let's play again.""TL;DRThe game's a blast, and is a fun combat racing game, though there is definitely more emphasis on the combat.

								Having previously written a negative review, after a recent update I've decided to change it.The handling needs a little work still, but the combat is solid and the environments are much nicer and more varied. Previously you could drive up and down 90 degree walls all day, now there's at least a sense of weight to the bike.It's got a ways to go but at this point it's now worth a purchase.

								This game is quite amazing(Road Rash nostalgia) but it feels more like brawl than a race. It feels like everyone made a conspiracy to beat me out of the race and also the game feels quite difficult. The devs should optimize the game further not because I am a low-budget gamer but for online.Edit: After the update, game feels balanced but still needs more optimization.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I'm only near 2 hours into the game and I'm already hooked on it! The blue knight dude is my best man of choice. It's a lot of fun whacking the police in the face, getting the rival gang to smash into a car's rear end. Not many weapon choices or bikes as of yet. Would be even more fun if you get to choose a car to drive in. Or make a playlist of your own. This game reminds me of GTA but with just motorcycles.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								♥♥♥♥in' Rainbow Road! Hahahahaha! Oh man, I was on Skype with my buddy and I just lost it when I hit Rainbow Road. Anyway, great game, totally enough bikes, weapons and characters for a Early Access game. I hope they do plan on expanding the skill tree by a lot and somehow adding in a online multiplayer and not just LAN multiplayer. This game would be a riot with friends, though I can understand, with the fast-paced style of the game, why anything but LAN might be a bad idea, it could still be implemented with a disclaimer.

								As is this is a wonderfully fun game. Very much like road rash. I gave put about 6 hours into it and have finished the standard playthrough with the option to due new game+. I have completed my skill tree and I believe I've seen every weapon there is, so far.Pros:Great Road Rash like game with replayability.Good artwork. (not that you can tell because of speed and stuff going on)Diverse weapon selectionDecent rider selection with different abilitiesIn-betweens:A lot going on in a race. Might have to block while turning while dodging that car, oh watch out for that semi behind you that slams into you.Rooftop levels.... Cons:The physics sometimes don't do what you would expect. Like a head-on with a car might get you stuck against the hood rolling backwards instead of throwing you to the pavement.Currently the cars' drivers have a standin model that is just a crash test dummyThe grappling gun sometimes would attach to something behind or to the side rather than the target I'm aiming at.Overall:Great game, fun and fast. You will probably end up stopping in the middle because of something stupid that happens, but you will come back.There is multiplayer but I haven't had a chance to play it yet.$20 might be a little high for the 6 or so hours you will put in, I'd recommend getting it during a sale.11/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The gameplay is a lot of fun and definitely has a lot of ""Road Rash"" flavor and being a big fan of that game in my childhood I'm excited to see that winning formula return in Road Redemption. The gameplay and racing is fluid and there is an interesting skill tree to level up wisely. My only gripe with the game in the very short time I have tried playing it is it comes across a little linear in Road Rash you could do what you want when you wanted so far Road Redemption seens to stick on one path. Overall definitely worth a try as improvements keep getting added.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								One of the most fun games I have bought in ages. I had Road Rash on the Sega Saturn, and I don't remember it ever being this much fun, although an awesome game. I hope it continues to be developed as it has been, as it seems that it will be out of ""early access"" in the near future. There are a few glitches, like obects that you can get stuck in/behind and not get out of, but they are minor and the sorts of things that you seen on games post-release. Controls are good with the Xbox One controller.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Brings back some serious road rash memories. Game plays well, no crashes, no bugs I've seen. The only thing I didn't really like was the levels where a biker keeps dropping mines to what seems to be a bit too much...once you get hit with one or crash behind the guy you're nearly trapped lol. Perhaps a reduction in how frequently they drop or explosion size. Other than that, I love it. Excited for multiplayer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								As a little kid, the Road Rash games made we want to travel...and maybe bash people with chains a bit, but I loved the sense of freedom and power. Road Redemption does a million things better than those games from two decades ago, but also has yet to unlock that sense of agency and independence.What has me writing my review today is that the project has been receiving a lot of attention from its developer over the past several weeks with a constant stream of updates that add content and improve gameplay. The developer is clearly putting a lot of heart into making this a classic, and I want to add my voice in getting it the attention it deserves.The Good:Bonkers races that just don't appear in other racing gamesModern graphicsAttacks include kicks, grabs, firearms, timebombs, and a slew of melee weapons from makeshift to medievalRPG character unlocks & between-race buff shopBathooksGamepad supportThe Bad:Almost no control over races or progressionYou pick your bike at the start of a game and you ride it until you dieAutos' behavior is almost always erratic and sometimes inexplicable (driving off bridges, into cliffs, etc.)Crazy races, an array of weapons, gamepad support and constantly improving gameplay make this a title I keep coming back to play rather than just wait for it to all be finished.

								Think about any medieval fighting game, then put yourself into a motorbike. That's what Road Redemption is. No plot, no getting serious, just pure violenece on the road focused on shoving people off the road. Get uprades, permanent skills, various weapons and face rivals which quite quickly get too easy... Anyway it's fun to get rid of your opponets instead of trying to outrace them.My recommendation: Get it, although don't expect some serious story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Disclosure: Received review copyedit: A couple of patches has been released since this review and most of the issues has been fixed. gameplay has been altered a lot and xp system is now working properly. i have not seen any clipping problems either or crashes.  Opponents tend to home in on you more and difficulty has been slightly increased later on but this is all good as balance is better early game. Upgrades mean a lot to you late game. All in all this is now easily 8 or 9/10 now. Shortly this game is a 7/10 In it's current state and already a pretty solid recommendation. It is however a game in early access and has potential for a much higher score after some alterations to the game. So lets list the good and the bad: Good:- So how many Sega Road Rash -type of games have you seen lately? In 2015 the concept is looking quite fresh. - Good action. Satisfying violence.  Speed! - Experience points that can be distributed to skills permanently. - Experience points that can be used to get upgrades that are in effect until you die. Bad: - This is one of those games where the AI is right behind you and if you make a mistake late on a course it's all over in a blink.  Luckily some mistakes are allowed if you are not that far into a race and your hitpoints allow you to continue. - Random nature of the maps underscores the importance of luck sometimes quite a lot unfortunately. It is common to grind one level a long time until that one time the stars are aligned correctly and you clear it flawlessly. - Bugs, glitches. Not that many and not that critical. But railings on the bridge are very bugged as they are there pretty much just for show. Also the ground under bridges are the best places to make the game glitch so bad you fall trought the ground into the void. - It is possible to stop from full speed to zero in an instant and get stuck on things near the road or civilian cars that drive on the road. I was not amused when i got hooked on a car for a long time unable to get off. Quit button solved that one. - Restart button missing. Essential function in any racing game. Put on the Road -button is there but it's not the same nor does it work most of the time until you are very deep outside the road. (and guaranteed to loose the race at that point). - Experience point system could use a closer look. Loosing all XP in certain situations ensure there is extra grind that does not help. Even keeping small amounts of XP after every game would help.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								Just started playing this, but heres my opening thoughts.The menus are a bit bare bones, it looks a bit 'cheaply' made, not exactly super awesome textures on the menus and what not so far.The controls are nice, but using a controller (as I do for most racing games) its a bit hard to control the camera, the gas, and the shooting all at once. If you drop any of those out of it its doable, but its definitely hard to drive and fire guns at the same time.Now for the good things, or should I say Great things. When not using a gun the controls work wonderfully. Its easy enough to hit your targets, and the dodging in and out of cars is very fun. You don't feel like you're fighting the controls or anything, they're super tight for driving.It brings back extremely fond memories of Road Rash, and the dynamic missions were very fun. Every time I'd die, it would feel like a new experience. I didn't have any chains of missions that were similar.The Variety in challenges was actually very nice. I thought I had a normal race, and immediately hit nitro to get into an early lead. Imagine my surprise when CARS STARTED RAINING FROM THE SKY. My shock and inability to dodge cars that suddenly appeared before me made that run end very quickly.All in All, the game is super interesting. I'll definitely put more time into it, and I cannot wait to try out the multiplayer. For now I recommend picking it up if you liked Road Rash, we'll see how it turns out as it progresses out of Early Access and even more features are added.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Do you like bike racing games and violence? Then this is the perfect game for you! Sure there was a game just like this before but this is supposed to be a remake. To bring this amazing game concept back to life, but BETTER!I love how the races are randomly chosen by the game and how the game mechanics work. I can only give you a little warning. This game is a bit intensive specs wise so make sure you got a decent machine to play it. Game barely runs on mine since I got to yet upgrade it but that is not enough to not recomend it to anybody else.I also want to thank the devs of this game for personally adding me on Steam and letting me try the game for my honest opinion about it.

								Review reposted from http://wskosc.blogspot.co.uk (Whiskey Reviews)Road Rash was a classic motorcycle combat game from the heated 16-bit era that sadly fizzled out with a mediocre Playstation game and slipped from the public eye to snuff it while huffing gasoline fumes in a gutter. But like any much loved series it eventually comes back around, Electronic Art's 'leaked' pre-alpha footage rekindled interest in the series but again ultimately died before coming to fruition.Thankfully we have a savior; Road Redemption is here to clobber your senses with a bit of pipe at a hundred miles an hour and it doesn't miss the mark.Being the spiritual successor to Road Rash is simultaneously a big thing to live up to and ridiculously simple. You need a road, turns are optional. You need bikes and riders and you need something for them to smack each other around the chops with. But you also have a small but starved community to satisfy and a legacy that roared out of the gate with the very first entry.Even in this early access build I can confirm that Road Redemption has roads, bikes, riders and various objects intended to meet the face of anyone in arms reach. The developers have also taken a bold step forward by mixing up the formula with two forms of progression through the campaign (whether these progression options will carry to other modes of play remains to be seen); there's an RPG-like skill tree that you spend XP on to unlock more health, faster bikes, more shop options, etc.There's also a shop between races where you use cash accumulated in the race to buy various buffs or modifiers that last until you die. Thanks to the randomly selected race types and objectives through the campaign each play is unique despite the strong urge to gravitate towards certain shop items such as extra lives and more health/XP.I'm not sure how much of the graphics and sounds are complete or placeholder at the moment so it's hard to comment with any accuracy on their final level of quality. The graphics aren't bad though, they're nicely detailed and the speed of the game helps to smooth over any rough edges though some more detail and effects would help to spice up the somewhat dull feeling crashes between bikes and cars right now.These issues could perhaps be helped with more dust and particle effects, or more detailed damage models on the cars - not asking for soft-body physics or anything here but when you hit a car head on and get catapulted over the bonnet while it just stops dead on the road without any visible damage it completely pulls you out of the experience and reminds you that this is an early access game.Sound effects are quite basic but not bad in quality either, you won't be reaching for the mute button but aren't going to be calling Rolling Stone to nominate the soundtrack for an award. Weapons making contact have various thunks and slashes that are satisfying enough especially when your opponent and bike separate from the impact.The addition of guns to the formula is another contentious point; with keyboard and mouse controls the guns are incredibly powerful thanks to the ability to aim and fire with the mouse but suffer when using a pad due to the split focus inherent with using the right analogue stick to look around.The guns also sound and feel a bit flat, often kills on cars or other bikers are announced with some floating numbers and a message on the side of the screen and so they can feel both useful and dull at the same time. Again this is a problem that may be solved as development progresses and could easily be countered by introducing reloads, some kind of lock on mechanic for pad users and a few better effects such as dropping the weapon when it's empty, or discarding empty magazines to clatter along the road upon reloading.Fingers crossed.Despite the slight hiccup in controls when aiming guns both the keyboard and gamepad controls are responsive and usable though the keyboard commands cannot be rebound at the moment (though that feature is apparently coming) which may cause some issues for players who can't get their head or fingers around the default controls.The gamepad on the other hand feels like the best way to play the game in terms of driving and attacking, the Xbox 360 pad was responsive and accurate with a comfortable control layout that mimics the standard style driving controls for most other games so Road Redemption is mostly pick up and play for any gamer with even passing experience with the driving genre.Race objectives vary from simple races to defeating a number of opponents with or without weapons with a bunch of variants between - antagonizing the cops, taking out opponents without using weapons, time trials and so forth. Through the 10+ mission campaign these objectives often repeat but the three different course types (desert, snow and rooftops) offer some variety which is augmented by various patterns of traffic, additional racers in cars and humvees instead of bikes and a stormcloud that rains various vehicles down on the track.Also included are two attachments that are supplied to you at certain points throughout the campaign; the first is a jetpack attached to the bike allowing you to perform a spectacular rocket assisted jump whenever you like which can get you out of a jam in even the direst of circumstances.The second attachment is a kind of harpoon gun that keeps a rope attached between your rider and whatever object you spear. This can be used to hook onto cars, riders, terrain or even more spectacularly helicopters for a Spiderman like swing through the air that you'd be hard pressed not to augment with the jet pack. This weapon also comes with about twelve-thousand rounds so you can fire it off to your heart's content.Sadly the usefulness of this weapon is limited due to the aforementioned aiming/driving issues with a gamepad.Overall Road Redemption is a satisfying and worthy Road Rash successor and has enough ideas of its own to not be a cheap cash in or clone. If the developers can apply the polish and get a larger variety of environments and perhaps even bikes or customization options implemented the game's appeal could skyrocket to include even those who don't fondly remember the mid-'90s highway punch-up.Another issue the developers will have to address is longevity - multiplayer features (also coming in a later build) will go a long way so long as the community embraces the game but an expanded single player campaign and progression tree would really go the extra mile instead of feeling like a moderately lengthy detour.Some other small touches such as rider and cop names, I took down Terry Pratchett at one point, and a spectacular final level in the campaign to reward persistent players lend the game a lot of incidental charm too.Score: 7 out of 10 bikers pretend carpet burn is road rash.

Not really support it Just support the native desktop resolution currently in use. Zombie Driver does this as well as a few other indie games.Graphics needs improvement as well as the controls, overall feel of the game is a little glitchy.Can't do wheelies that I know of or lean forward or backwards.These are just nitpicks, really. but it would be nice to support my 5760x1080 resolution.Overall this game is really fun, jump in & just start racing & kicking♥♥♥♥♥..lol			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								As of the date I write this comment, I do like this game. I have however noticed a strange momentum bug where if you go over ramps sometimes you suddenly stop or drastically slowdown and if the devs are reading our posts please fix this when you get the time. Other than that it's a great game and a nice reminder of Road Rash 64.The road bombs in campaign+ are a tad harsh for my liking and they're somewhat unpredictable so do think they should tone it down a bit. It seems being hit by them is more about bad luck than lack of skill. They put a burden on the CPU as well, with all the other physics going on, especially on the tornado levels.I am looking forward to more updates, more tracks, music, challenges, motorcycles (with different motor sound FX) and possibly more upgrades. I would also like to see a hardcore mode added where your 2x health upgrade is disabled and enemies do more damage. 2 hits and you're dead unless you manage to scrounge more health off the enemies you kill. For example.I recommend this to any Road Rash fan or anyone else who saw the trailer and wants to try this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I have never played Road Rash, so I can't really compare the two, but I can say that this game is worth it and it's only in early access. The developer is very nice and seems dedicated to this game.

								I played a lot of Road Rash 1, 2, and 3 on my Sega Genesis way back in the day.  When I saw that this team was trying to revive the spirit of Road Rash, I was very interested.  After seeing all the additional effort that has gone into the game recently, I figured I'd pick up a copy while it was on the Summer sale...Overall, it's not entirely Road Rash, and I think gameplay-wise, it has a way to go if it's trying to be the next Road Rash.  The graphics a decent and the concept is there and who doesn't love hitting someone upside the head with a pipe while riding a motorcycle?  I think the campaign is fun, but it gets a bit repetitive, especially when you have to start over.  I could definitely live without the guns, they're a pain to use and apparently the AI has infinite ammo and never misses, making it all that much more frustrating.Overall, fun game and worth the $11 for a little Road Rash throwback fun!

								I love this game. If you liked Road Rash back in the day then this game is for you...when they get it to actually work. The game crashes at the loading screen for the 3rd race everytime. I've changed settings, I've had it run in different compatibility modes and always the same thing. I wouldn't let this affect the rating except that despite the dev accepting crash logs via their email I haven't heard back once after sending them 4 crash logs. I'll change this review to a positive one if they ever take the time to respond to me.Update: I fixed it myself. not thanks to the devs. really fun game now that I can actually play it.

								I loved the old Road Rash; is this that same game? No, but it certainly scratches the same itch.Art / Graphics - The art style doesn't have the same whimsy as the original Road Rash, but it does the job. While it would be nice to see Character portraits, some customizability for a character (ie, pick colors, bike aesthetics, etc) it's not a deal breaker.Sound - The soundtrack is limited; It’d be great to get more variety in there, but it doesn’t distract, and provides a nice background ebb and flow. The SFX are straightforward and make appropriate sounds for appropriate attacks.Controls - The controls took a little getting used to, and I’m not sure that I have the full hang of them yet. It’s a little counter intuitive that left attack = X but right attack = Y instead of B. There’s a brief learning curve, but after a few minutes I found myself accepting some of their slight quirks without any real issue (I have not tried the game KBM yet).Gameplay - Gameplay feels a little shallow at this moment. The campaign mode has basically two mission types (“race for first place” or “race to take out targets”). Again, this isn’t a deal breaker, and even though there is persistent mechanics, it doesn’t give me any kind of satisfaction. It could be that you unlock more the further you get, but early game at least, if feels very much like an uphill slog. It also doesn’t seem to have any “Save Points” for the Campaign mode, so if you “die”, you die and have to start over.Stability - I didn’t not have any issues while playing. Game ran smoothly at a consistent 60 fps and was free from any kind of significant glitching / bugs (there were a few times where I clipped through the terrain, but it was minor and generally when I was off roading and about to die).Overall - I would recommend this game; It includes local co-op, it’s satisfying in bite sized chunks (I played for about three hours today before I decided to walk away). In it’s current state, I’d say it’s about a 7.5-8/10. It’s better than average, and since it’s currently in early release I wouldn’t be surprised if the UI and story was fleshed out a bit before release.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								It's Road Rash reincarnated. The ""campaign"" mode isn't finished yet, but you will get several hours of gameplay before you finish the game. It has local co-op and controller support, but the balance doesn't seem to change for co-op, so it's a breeze to finish if you are playing with someone else. I very much enjoy it, but it's still a long way from being complete.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Okay, this is a very interesting game for me and for anybody that played RoadRash in the 90's...This game tries to reactivate the feeling of those fast paced and violent motocycle races. And it achieves this goal at some points. And does not at others.Pros: It is fun to play. It reminds you of RoadRash immediately. Kicking and punching, Weapons,... while riding endless highways with your motocycle is exactly what i would expect from it :) great.Cons: Still early access so this section might change. But there are some points i want to see improved: Mouse and keyboard does not work fine. You swing your weapon with a left click for left and a right click for right - and you move the camera with the mouse. so you will end up hitting but not seeing where you're driving and respectively.Also there could be some improvements with the collision modell or track limitations: sometimes you can run off the track quite well, other times you fall immediately.Conclusion: If you loved RoadRash you will find a bit of the feeling in this game... If there is some polish, this could end up being a great, fun game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Brought back the memories of one of my most favorite games Road Rash.Has all the right elements for endless amount of fun.Nice visuals, decent game play.As the game is not yet completed it is highly expected the game would be more polished than it is presently.Anyone a fan of road rash it is a must buy game.Tips for the Developers:1.Ultra-Wide Support at 3440x1440p is a must for any game of 2016.2.Game should have more racing involved and not just whack and slash which is mostly now.3.Better and wide varieties of Bikes.Weapons are a sure hit though. Definitely recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								THIS GAME ROCKS ! ! ! This is the true successor to Road Rash in every way. If Rockstar games could have fit this into the GTA series, it would have been doable. HOWEVER, the rogue-like quality of the game taps into the pick up and play appeal of this game. No convoluted story-line. No time consuming cut scenes. Just balls-to-the-wall rashin'. With, I may add, some great innovations over the Road Rash series. Firstly, the booster jets that allow the player to basically jump in a racing game; YET another reason why jumping in a video gam6o1 much more depth. Add to that the experience tree, array of weapons for play types, multiple attack options, and varied mission objectives. The game is wonderful and runs great on my crappy laptop to boot.How well does this game translate to modern times from its 16/32 bit roots?  I just played this game with my 10 - 13 year old cousins and they had a blast. Watching the near miss crashes, walloping enemies, and finally getting wasted when the health meter drops, brought me back to my childhood days of Road Rash on genesis and psx.This game is well worth the price.  AND, you get shovel knight! WTF????!?!!?! yes, shovel knight.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Road Redemption is a good little motorbike racing game; nothing amazing, but a nice bit of fun.It is highly reminiscent of the game Road Rash, from the 1990s.You speed along America's highways, fighting off rival bikies and the occasional cop, bashing and slashing with iron pipes and swords; as well as which you sometimes also get pistols, rifles, and C4 explosives, all to cause a bit of mayhem.Sometimes you race, whilst at other times your objective is to eliminate your enemies.The background music is not a bad collection of musak; nothing to write home about, but not annoying like it can be in some other games (that's according to personal taste, of course).The only complaint I have about the game is a pedantic grammar problem, as the game's makers have left out some apostrophes. Developers, please make the appropriate changes.- Should be ""an enemy's helmet"", not ""an enemys helmet"".


Nooooo!!!!! Not ENEMYS, it should be ENEMY'S. Please use an apostrophe.

- Should be ""you're racing"", not ""your racing"".


Nooooo!!!!!  Not YOUR; it should be YOU'RE. Please use an apostrophe. 
A Screenshot of Road Redemption
By: Redbeard




- Usually, it should be ""Phill's mountain"", but if it is a place name (""Phills Mountain"") then the standard practice seems to be to drop the apostrophe (not that I'm happy with that, but that's how it is); so, this one could be alright to keep in.


Apparently, this is the place for Phill.

								I've played it yesterday. The graphics are quite nice and the speed gives a good feeling to ride a bike. The controls are very good in this game. But it needs far more details, like plants, grasses,  trees and so on. I loved the Road Rash Series for the Genesis in the 90th, there you have some animals on the streets or nearby like cows or deers, maybe that would be nice in this game. Or some oil leaks, a damaged road, some more details maybe. But this game is very good in Early Access, can't wait for the final release, very good work!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

AddictiveRoad Redemption (RR) is, in a word: addictive.Fast paced, challenging, and surprisingly well rounded- (despite being early access) RR is a welcome addition to the action-racing genre.In RR you play as a member of a motorcycle gang, armed to the teeth with various weapons ranging from a Viking axe, to a grenade launcher.Timing your strikes is key, as well as micromanaging, as you battle both the traffic, and members of opposing gangs in game modes that are both bizarre, and extremely fun to master.Multiplayer has been promised, and is in the works- and will only serve as a boon to the title's popularity.If you are a fan of racing, and fast paced combat: Road Redemption is a gaming experience not to be missed.

								The rumors are true:Road Redemption is quite the reboot of the old Road Rash games - the motorbiking, chain-slinging, crash-inducing racing game of late. This is not a bad thing, the devs have nailed the core game play that made those games fun and added new ridiculously entertaining modes like the one where cars are continuously dropped from the sky. Litereally. DROPPEDFROM THE SKY.At the game's current beta state I can't recommend it for general purchase at $19.99, but if you are interested in seeing this game grow the core mechanics are freaking fun and worth a go.

								I've been looking for a good Combat Racer and I think I've found the one I want. This game is wondeful, the combat feels great! (It feels like I've really just smacked that guy in the face with a sledgehammer and sent him flying off his bike!) The only thing is, I wish I could duck. There have been times where two cyclists are at either end of me and try to hit me at the same time. It'd be halarious to see them smack each other. The Motorcycles feel good, the sounds are okay. Need a tibbit of work, expecially the guns. They're not bad, though. The visuals are all pretty nice, too! There's an assortment of races and mission types generated each time you play, and few diffrent tracks. I also must say, the soundtrack is wonderful. I'd love to be able to pick it up!Also, if the developers come across this review..I've only run into one bug. On the Rooftop race..I fell off and I was spawned on the very edge of the roof, so I kept falling off. Though, pausing and clicking ""Place me back on the track"" fixed that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Worth the money?Yes, I think so!Production and gameplay are well executed. What you get for ~20 bucks is a fair trade.Is it a modern update or successor to original Road Rash ?I played GameGear and later PC Road Rash but cannot say that this is Road Rash.Like other people say: Bikes and weapons is where the equalition ends.It reminds me of ""Outlander""(NES, Mad Max) on bikes but without the ""off vehicle"" beat'em up stages.Ian Fisch wants to know whether I'm having fun...I tell you Ian my fun is limited because:- GamePad(Xbox) controll sux and cannot be changed. Driving & Aiming a gun via analogstick is a nightmare! Especially caused by the whole view is moved with the gun aim. Moving just the aim would probably work better without a fast input like a mouse.- GamePad controll sux even more because you weirdly managed to put 3 main actions to the right side of the pad while the left hand only steers. Please explain what your idea was to hold accelerate, aim with stick and release shot via RB with the same right hand while left hand only steers on analogstick but cannot shot on LB? -I didn't knew that a bike has an larger turn angle than my real life SUV but ... okay we keep on falling down bridges and roofs after crashing into one of your damn magnitic halu zone cars, np dude, rly.-Did I say halu zone magnetic cars ? Did you receive ""Worst feature in a game"" SteamAward for that ? No ? Maybe next year!Well I hope these points get fixed somewhere in the future. Apart from that I'm happy with my 20 bucks motobike beat'em up, thank you Mr. Fisch ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								 I have just recently gott back into video games, a friend turned me onto steam and after about 15 years of not playing I got the bug again. Being that i am an ald fart, I remember a very similar game from the 90s. I don't need to mention the name. if you remeber it you will know. I spent hours playing that game and wished for a newer version for years. It never came came along untio. now. This is it! A new name but the same gamplay. i love it. I only just played a quick race but know I will be spending hours riding and slashing it up on this one. Thank you to all the people who are creating this gem. I look forward to seeing how it develops. the graphics are great and I love how it feels.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I first bought this game early in its release and wrote it off as a bad game. It felt more like a cheap flash game. However...  After reading about the ""HUGE UPDATE"" in the news section I came back to give it another try, and all I can say is - WOW, what a difference a year makes. It's almost an entirely different gameplay experience. The bikes control like they should, combat is fun, and there's a nice feeling of speed. Graphics and interface have been much improved as well. Most importantly, I was actually having FUN. Overall, I'm happy with the progress this game has made in the past year, and I'm actually looking forward to the release now. If the devs keep going I feel like this game will have loads of potential and a bright future. Defintiely looking forward to playing more of this game when I have more time tomorrow.

								Case Study:Was in a race for my life, under attack by the 666 biker gang. Attached C4 to a bike and kicked it into a crowd of bikers. Action movie explosion ensued and the game stated ""You killed PewDiePie"". This is the happiest I have ever been. This game is worth playing hourly just to kill PewDiePie again and again.

								Holy CRAP this game is fun. If I wasn't so lazy I'd be on the edge of my seat. I really like the combination of game over death, permanent upgrades, and the in-between-level store. Seems pretty fair in difficulty, with the occasional cluster♥♥♥♥ out of nowhere keeping things fun.From time to time there'll be a lag hiccup of about a half-second to two seconds, which rarely improves my position in the game, but I'm not certain that my computer isn't to blame.Vigorous congratulations to the developer(s) for your(their) work.

								A very polished early access game. Remember the old Road Rash games?  That's what this is, with addition of features and some still being added in. This has come a long way since the first day I bought it.  It has experienced a graphical overhaul, the combat has been tightened, AI has become more responsive and the tracks are more diverse.  I have seen and played a lot of early access games and this one is by far the greatest game I have ever played and is most deserving of purchasing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								So, it was somewhere around 2014 or 2015, and apparently, one of the devs of this game literally gave me a code to try it out. I don't know why me of all people, but I took the offer (think I might have had it on my wishlist or something.) Initially, seeing a man named Jerma985 play this game lead me to believe this game was a meme, ya know. But to be fair, it has pretty nice features all around. I'd recommend getting it.

								Road Rash was one of the first game that i played in my life So when i saw Road Redemption.. i felt something ""the inner child"" in me wanted some of this so bought it .. and IS IT WORTH IT? HELL YEAHPros1- Rooftops Racing is awesome! and the Jetpacks are amazing idea to keep the game funny, it can get a little buggy, but a wild experience on the rooftops 2- RainBow road .. which i think i don't have to say it again .. RAIN BOW !3- 12 action-packed levels so far.. and believe me it doesn't get reptitive .. for me i think.. it always amazing to repeat the game 4- the Skill tree (Both Pro/Con)5-SPLITSCREEEN!! it's awesome with bros or friends .. 6- Awesome Variety of guns Cons1- Skill Tree Can make the game super easy with 600 Health you can complete the game in under 25 minutes and never buy something to refill your health2- music is kinda cheesy.. wish they add MP3 player in it3- Aiming is easy .. like i can shoot with a shotgun with 500meter apart or something and boom headshot and he diesit's fun like i said,, but will be abused in mutliplayerMy Thoughts?

Early Access Review
								As of v0.816:Road Redemption is a kickstarted spiritual successor for 90-s Road Rash series.And, well, it's pretty damn good at re-making the gameplay and overall feel of the Road Rash series.Bikes, tons of weapons, fighting on the road, kicking opponents into the abyss - all of this is there.But Road Redemption is a very silly game (in a good way). Not even once it considers itself serious.Expect tornados throwing cars all around the level, bomb that appear out of nowhere to blow you and your opponents up as well as crazy rides on the rooftops (with your regular traffic around as well, yep).Most of the things in game are randomly generated. While this means you can literally play it endlessly and get a new experience every time, this also brings in some issues.For example, sometimes roads are generated in a very strange way so that you cannot really see what's coming next.The fog from explosions seems to be just a texture (or maybe it's just the particles are not transparent at all?) and you cannot really see what's behind it.Some of those random things makes you feel cheated when you lose because of them.They are definitely fixable, though. And every patch makes them a bit better.In general it's a very pleasantly and crazy experience for those of you who want to scratch that Road Rash itch, as well as just for people looking to have some motorcycle combat fun.More detailed look in the video:

Early Access Review
								This game is in early access, so you already know what that means: it's not complete and it's a little rough in some spots. That said, I unexpectedly played this game for about 4 hours straight because I was having a lot of fun. Here's a section of gameplay with cars raining from the sky:


YouTube™ Video: Road Redemption Gameplay: Car Rain 

			Views: 202		

			In Road Redemption, sometimes cars fall from the sky. I'm not even sure if it is a bug. If it is: it is so hilarious that I kind of hope it makes it in to the final game in some fashion.		

Some of you may be too young to have ever played Road Rash, but this game is on track to being better than one of the classics from my childhood. Players get a bike and have various objectives while racing around deserts, icy mountains and even city skylines. Much like Road Rash, the player is armed and able to kick and attack other bikers with weapons. Unlike Road Rash, however, Road Redemption has a huge arsenal of melee weapons and guns to lay waste to others on the road. Pasting C4 on bikers and blasting a cop car with a gernade launcher is exteremly fun.So far, only some single player content is in, but multiplayer is on the way. Road Redemption has a few different mission types that vary from ""get the attention of the police"" to ""kill all these guys without weapons"" and they mix up the gameplay quite a bit. Presently: when a mission is completed, you're on to the next level. Completing these challenges and killing enemy bikers and cars gives you cash for buying upgrades for the next level. When you die, it's over, and you lose all your cash and upgrades. However, there's also a skill system, where you use experience points earned from killing bikers and cops to buy upgrades for things like health, better starting weapons and more nitro boosts. It's a little rough at the moment (the tree itself could use some visual tweaks), but the idea is awesome for a game of this style.So far, the only negatives I can even think of are some bugs and preformance issues. The game chugs a bit (probably due to physics stuff since changing quality and antialiasing doesn't change it much), but it's still surprisingly playable during this. There's a few infinite loading bugs that I can't seem to reproduce, and once I got stuck in the skyline when I fell inbetween some buildings, but otherwise nothing that some polish won't fix.

								Type of Game:Action Motorcycle RacingVersion Played:PC version through SteamSimilar Games:Road Rash and to a lesser degree Destruction DerbyThe Good:Fast and furious violent action using an assortment of weapons.Weapons include melee weapons (swords, axes, bats and so forth) and firearms (shotguns, pistols, machine guns and my personal favorite the grenade launcher).Levels will keep you on your toes with lots of different way to knock you off your bike such as cars, rival bikers and logs dropping of trucks and that’s just on the road.Shop in-between levels to boost ammo, health, nitro, durability of melee weapons, and much more. Be warned that these upgrades disappear after you lose all your health on the road.There is persistent experience generation (from killing rival bikers and destroying cars) that allows you to get points to spend upgrading your bike, max health, upgrading your starting weapons, and so forth. These bonuses always stay with you no matter how many times you restart a level.Split screen campaign (soon to be online). Works very well with shared bonuses from the shop and also a competitive mode is in the works too.At the time of writing there has been 6 updates to knock out bugs, increase performance and add new content and the game hasn’t been out a month yet, so yes dear reader this is a dev team that listens to its community and keeps an eye out for bugs.The Bad:There are no key-bindings just yet (there is a placeholder in the options) so just a head’s up if you don’t have a game-pad. You will struggle without one.Aiming your cross-hair to use firearms is very difficult and there isn’t a button to reset your camera. What ends up happening is after you try aiming and want to have your camera dead center you need to do it manually and fast before you go head first into a car. I have faith in the dev team that this is going to be sorted out sooner rather than later.The hit detection seems a bit off from the rival bikers as there able to hit you when they’re in mid air and you’re on the ground, although it seems to happen more on “the rooftop” levels then in the other levels.Nitpicking:Yes Road Redemption has bugs, a fair few to put mildly, but only just a few weeks old on Steam and they’ve already released several patches to address the big ones.Did I make time to complete it?Yes. 5 times so far in 11 hours.Redlight or Greenlight:This game is currently at a greenlight.Thanks to the dev team for handing out plenty of patches in a short amount of time (big company’s take note). I was a kickstarter backer paying $20, but it was money well spent and I’d gladly spend double if not more for this great title. I’m really, really glad its this team (Dark Seas Games) that has made RR and by the time this has released in its final form it’ll be an instant classic and definitely my game of the year. Can you tell I’m biased towards Road Rash style games?Reviewer:BeefyA Quick Look at Those Games You Might Buyhttp://www.gamersglance.com ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game is rough around the edges. If you're careful about it you can even fly through entire races using your grappling hook like some sort of Hell's Angel/Spiderman hybrid. Its riddled with bugs and the mechanics behind races means its nearly impossible to catch up to rival racers in several modes. Despite the unpolished bits the combat has an incredibly satisfying sense of crunch. Since everyone is flying along at hundreds of miles per hour any hit that connects sends enemies flying like you just hit a home run. Hopefully as development goes on we'll see the rest of gameplay get tightened up a bit, right now it probably isn't worth a buy, but there is definitely enough here to have a real gem of a game in the future.

								Hey, you!  Buy this game!  It's every bit as fun as it looks.  The bikes are satisfying to ride.  The physics are more arcadey than realistic, meaning they're fun and forgiving.  Even with a mouse & keyboard it controls fine.  The weapons are hilarious, from knocking a rider's block off with a long shovel to slapping a C4 time bomb on his back.  When that fails, you can grab a rider and steer him into traffic, or just kick him right off a bridge.There are different mission types, and while there is permadeath, your upgraded skills carry over into subsequent playthroughs.  Also, the soundtrack is fantastic.  The developer has been very active, releasing updates as often as every day since I picked this up during the last summer sale.The downsides I've noticed include the interface, which is kind of ugly and poorly structured.  The rooftop levels aren't as solid as the open road levels, but they're getting there.  If multiplayer is of paramount importance, you'd better wait.  For everyone else, this game is already plenty of fun in its current state.  To put it differently, I don't see buying this now as a gamble, unlike other Early Access games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I was wary when I first saw this game being touted as ""The spiritual successor to Road Rash."" I loved Road Rash so much. But after playing this for 10 minutes, I found myself grinning like a lunatic and bouncing up and down with nostalgic delight! What I was hoping for was a remake of my old favourite that would take advantage of the new technology without getting lost in it. The classic old gameplay in a shiny new shell. What I got was exactly that. It really has the feel of Road Rash down beautifully and, as I had hoped, there are some cool new twists which I'll let you discover for yourselves. If you're looking for a HD Version of a 64Bit Classic done right, this is how it's done.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								It's like Dark Souls on motorcycles.Actually, being a huge fan of Road Rash back in the day, this game scratches that bike combat itch really nicely. It's still not nearly perfect but it's still amazing in it's current state. That bone crunching sound and puff cloud of blood followed by your enemy getting flung off their bike is what you live for in this game and it's oh so satisfying.The splitscreen multiplayer is also super hecticly fun and hilarious.Definitely a huge recommendation from me.EDIT: The game has had some updates here and there really adding nothing to the game besides fixing some minor bugs that I never ran into. I haven't seen an update in over a month. And calm the ♥♥♥♥ down people, the Dark Souls thing was an obvious joke.Cons-The UI still looks terrible and the handling can still be weird at times. -AI has been updated to be more agressive, but all that has done is make the AI gang up on you or fly past you and hit you perfectly with a weapon without even stopping. It's honestly made the AI a lot more annoying and not more difficult and they ""can"" stick to you like glue no matter if you're going over a jump or slapping that nitro, in the air, they will literally lose all air momentum and stick to you in the air, hit you and then take off in mid air. They can be really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t at times.The game isn't bad, I still have a lot of fun with it, but the devs really need to step up their game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Players Beware, This isn't a typical road rash clone. The level progression can be a little like Road Rash Jailbreak if any one still remembers that. You get so far into the game, and once you get a game over, You have to start all the way back to square one. This game is a little more lenient because you can gain XP to level up your skill tree. One Notch on the tree is to start from level 3 instead of level 1. A solid Check point system would be way better than having to buy them by failing Countless amounts of times. The AI can be really aggressive in some areas and really hard to complete the objective. Once you run out of super Melees, It's almost impossible to Knock the AI's Off their bikes In the Eliminate X amount of Opponents. In Road rash and other games, if you countered at the right time you got to take their weapons from them and stun them for a second making the progression doable. In Road Redemption you just dodge, and hope a gang of 10 other Bikers and Cops Don't Knock you out instantly sending you all the way back to either level one or the last purchased check point. The item system, though Unique makes the game interesting. There is a choice of Guns or melee weapons, like shovels, axes, bats ect. The bad thing is aiming while steering the bike. The environments can be so chaotic it makes the guns hard to use. So i don't. The weapons have health, so when they are depleted, you can't fight back or counter once you exhaust your last weapon. The weapons also Auto cycle when you knock out another biker. So if you like a particular weapon be prepared to get the next thing that comes your way. I like the health system concept this game has going for it and the screen affects when you have low health. You can Gain a little bit of health by knocking out other AI's. The bad, is in the Game mode where you have to take out X number of opponents. They tend to Clump together and gang up on you. Even The AI's that don't have cursors over their heads, and some of the other Cars.       The controls need more polishing, Needs a better turning radius. There is no way to make sharp turns, you have slowing down. There are some areas where you have to slow way down, or you will crash into a mountain or drive over it and fly out into the rest of the unpopulated map.       This game reminds me very much of Road rash. I loved that game. This Game has made a lot of good updates since it had released. Being able to do wheelys over objects and cars would be nice instead of face planting into them. Also whats up with car's and other vehicles being competition? I thought this was a bike only game.  It's fun, but a little confusing, hard and Chaotic at times. Still hadnt beaten it, but i do have a logn way to go with the way the game is. Keep up the good work developers, I hope my review helped.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Road Redemption is one of the most fun games ever with buddies and controllers, unless your buddies are babies, then one of them might cry and call it Road Resentment when you beat them all bad over and over again.Anyways, singleplayer is super fun when you need a change of gaming pace, and want some pure adrenaline violence like an hour or two before bed, without needing to save or continue anything.Totally legit spiritual successor to Road Rash, just outstandingly fun and clearly a personal passion for the devs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Once upon a time I was given a Sega Genesis and the game road rash. I played that game day and night as a kid. Somehow nothing quite like it has ever been made again.... until now. I saw this on sale in steam and was immediately hopeful that it would be like the Road Rash I once knew and loved. However, this game is even better.

								- Early Access Review -This game is a love-letter to the Road Rash series. Even in its current state, if you have any fond nostalgia for those games, you owe it to your inner-child to pick this title up.Currently, the game is limited to a campaign mode of progressive areas and difficulty. There is racing against the timer, racing against a specific rival gang, night driving, icy tracks, cars raining down from the sky, police chases, exploding vehicles, rooftop racing... and I enjoyed every satisfying slash and crash that forcibly de-seated my fellow racers as I burned past them. Every time you die, all of your XP earned through that play-through can be spent on permanent player upgrades, adding to your health, damage, weapon durability, ammuntion, etc... so on each successive run, you'll have even more of an edge on your side.The game plays fast and feels fast with little stuttering (running on an i3 processor with a GTX 640 Nvidia card), though there are instances of SUDDENLY-CARS, because the draw distance seems a little close to your bike. The way the bikes handle feels instinctive (using an x360 controller), and the button layout is workable... though not perfect. The ability to remap the keys isn't currently implemented, but it is one of the features on the list to be added. Based on the level of polish the game already has, this is definitely not a project with sloppy devs... I would highly believe that patches, new game modes, and features are en route.For downsides, though... with only one current play-mode, the game will grow repetitive after a while. The AI routines of the opponent riders is somewhat predictable, and once you learn the timing of the weapon swings, they frequently fall for a basic swerve-n-strike pattern. There are plenty of weapons to experiment with, including the grappling hook which is a blast to use, but its still an issue of slowly becoming familiar and then boring. There is no automatic lock-on for any firing weapon... that takes a while to get used to, as your ability to aim is also your camera control... perfect for the shotgun, but very tricky for the uzi. The roads themselves are far more lethal than the other riders, and while this is an excellent thing, currently specific conditions like the raining cars can make those races VERY difficult, and can completely shut down a run.Its an awesome thing to see, mind you... driving through a downpour of debris, but that feature needs to be scaled back enough to be able to actually navigate through the falling wrecks.Multiplayer is a listed feature of the game. That would seriously increase this game's replayability factor, and it would be AWESOME to be able to race against other players with this engine, but currently that feature isn't available.All that said, I still HIGHLY recommend this game in its current state. Its very playable, low on the glitches, a TON of fun, and I have full confidence that upcoming features and fixes will just make this even more enjoyable of an experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The update is really brilliant and takes it up to a whole new level than before, though it is really annoying to have to restart the campaign when ever I come off. I wish it could just be so if you died you have to restart as apposed when ever you come off because, if your like me, and barely have 2 hours solid to finish the game, it becomes incredibly irritating.

								I hope this review gets the devlopers attention while it is early access and has time to be fixed. I seriously want to love this game, but there are a lot of design flaws beyond bug fixes that simply do not make the game enjoyable.    A great example of this is the skill tree, which should be scrapped entirely for a new unlock system that changes your starting weapons and unlocks new motorcycles. Increasing your health, xp gains, and cast earned isn't healthy game play fun - its grindy and does not feel rewarding to the player.    Instead, picture that you only start the game off with a single character and bike, no weapons, and have to earn your way up the ranks. As you spend your xp after each match you unlock new characters (that start with a single weapon) or bikes with real differences. You shouldnt start each game with 3 weapons immediately, already on stage 3, and nearly irrelevant bike choices just because you played through a few times. I know it's early access - but this is the kind of thing that is getting old quickly.    The game also completely lacks personality from the other racers, and to make it worse it is littered with a bunch of randomly spawned NPC's to up the action. Instead keep my 10 or so competitors and make them challenging, make them try to grab me and block my shots, or boost when I try to shoot at them. Give them names and pictures, dialouge, they need personality.    Lastly, since right now your current objectives are all random - it makes for some frustrating game play. I don't mind the tornado, explosions in the middle of the road constantly levels, or roof top timed challenge modes existing.... if there was a choice to it. If i could choose to want to play that or not it would really help. I want a core gameply driven experience when I hit campaign, and I want a challenge type scenario placed elsewhere. My campaign should be an experience of improvement and difficulty to be the best racer out there, not dodging randomly generated falling cars.    The game is still fun, but I am not recommending it until I see some real direction put into the game instead of a bunch of randomly placed together content and skill trees.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Original review 16/42:Not now.This has potential, yes. Currently, it's not worth your money.Currently, there are loads of lockups which make the game practically unplayable, even on the lowest settings (This is coming from a guy who can max out Arma 3 and Battlefield 4, so no ""it's your computer"" comments please).I accepted this, thinking that maybe for whatever reason my i7 4770k processor wasn't powerful enough to procedurally generate the landscape quickly enough to drive on.I was wrong - This game boasts on the store page: ""Lead your motorcycle gang on an epic journey across the country in this procedurally-generated driving combat adventure.""Uh, no. One of the reasons I was interested in this is because of the procedural generation. There is NO procedural generation in this at all. After dying four times and being forced to restart the game (This isn't as annoying as it sounds, fortunately), I realised I was racing on the EXACT same stretch of road each time.Give it a while until this is in a playable state, I'll update this when a major patch comes in.UPDATE 12/10/2014: The devs have spoken to me twice about their progress and patches with the game, which I always appreciate. The latest patches seem to have introduced prcedural generation of landscapes, which is definitely a good thing.The FPS lag remains for me, though it's definitely improved and apparently being addressed currently.At the moment, the game still isn't exactly ""playable"" for me, though if you're willing to take the risk on serious performance issues, I would definitely go ahead and suggest it.UPDATE 18/05/2015 - With the game nearing what should be full release (It was meant to be Q1 2015, doesn't look like that's happened), I figured I should update this again.The dynamic content still isn't great, the first level always looks pretty much the same, the only difference seems to be day/night.As for FPS drops, the game in itself is much smoother but I still get lockups every time I kill an enemy.You can also take damage for a while after passing the finish line.Currently this is a ""Meh"" rather than a ""Yes"" or a ""No"", but I personally have some regrets still.UPDATE 15/06/2015: I'm changing this review to a positive one. I've spoken a number of times with the Road Redemption team who are obviously dedicated to making a good game and want to take the time to perfect it (Hence why it's still in EA, I assume).The lockups upon killing an enemy are apparently a design decision, which I understand - The developer said that it's an idea suggested by Vlambeer to have an impact pause and camera shake when hitting an enemy. It's not something I'm a fan of personally, but as the developers it's their prerogative to do what they like with their game. They've shortened these recently, I assume to interrupt the gameplay less, but I still feel like they might be unnecessary.Performance wise, the game runs at a solid 60fps on the highest settings now, which I find impressive considering the plethora of issues I had on launch.As for the dynamic content, I still feel like it leaves a fair bit to be desired - The map feels very similar, if not the same on every playthrough - Obviously level 1 is different from level 2, but level 1 feels the same on every run.The game itself plays really well, combat feels solid and there are plenty of different ways to take out your enemies and I love the idea of it being a semi-roguelike whereby you have permadeath but you can also upgrade your abilities for your next run.Overall, a really solid title now, runs well and the gameplay is great. My only gripes are the pauses when you hit an enemy and the lack of dynamic maps, but other than that I'm not sure I can fault it. Would recommend even at full price (At the time of writing it's on sale in the summer sale so you've got no reason to not buy it), there's enough content to tide you by for your money's worth.

								Hurr hurr more like road trash.Seriously though.  Can't help but feel totally misled about what this was going to be.  ""Modern road rash"" sounded pretty great.  Initially thought the current design of the game was just all placeholder early access stuff.  Uh, it doesn't seem to be?  Essentially there isn't much here - there is about as much gameplay depth and design to this as, I dunno, a wacky trainer for grand theft auto, and it has the look and physics feel of someone's first project in unity.  I can't see myself ever loading this again, and $20 for a few hours is pretty damn steep.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This gameright now is full of bugs and glitches. The A.I. is terrible but has gotten *slightly* better.While I used to LIKE, not love, Road Rash back in the day, this game is the hardest piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥I've come across due to the A.I. always catching up to me, matching my speed and then meleeing the ♥♥♥♥ out of me until we all:1. fall off a cliff2. fall off a building3. get hit by other vehicles4. get hit by hallucinatory raining cars5. glitch through each other and ragdoll out6. block all my attacks and break all my weapons then hit me with shovels7. random unavoidable explosionIt's ok, needs A LOT of work until it will be considered done. The soundtrack is pretty terrible in my opinion. It's the same few songs that sound so bland and generic that I just mute it and listen to something else. And both control schemes are very wonky, keyboard and controller.Overall, I'd say wait until it has a full release, read some reviews after that, and then maybe try to find a way to play it, maybe from a friend that has it or something, then if you like it, buy it. I am currently regretting this purchase.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								There are too many problems for me to recommend. I never feel good when I actually win a race. When it rains, I get at max 25 fps, no matter what the graphics are set to.

This game is kind of similar, but the randomized maps, added nitro, and lack of bike customization make it difficult for me to compare the two. With that being said, I don't think it needs to be Road Rash. I think it's a pretty solid game. The graphics are great, it's getting smoother and smoother with every new update, and the local co-op is an absolute blast. I still haven't gotten through the campaign+ mode but I feel like this game has great replayability. I seriously can't wait for the multiplayer and I'll hopefully update this when it comes out.

Early Access Review
								UPDATE:After the developer's constant patching of the game to improve performance, iron out bugs and adding features, I can now finally recommend Road Redemption. It's far from perfect yet, but it's more than playable, and offers hours of play with a decent variation in the level design, weaponry, challenges and so on. The mere fact that the devs have been working SO hard on improving the game is honestly reason alone to support the team and the game. While most devs hold off on updating their Early Access games for weeks or even months at a time, Road Redemption seems to be getting a near daily treatment of fixes, improvements and additions. If you have a problem with the game, you are pretty much guaranteed to see it fixed in a patch released before you know it.About the actual game; it's not quite identical to Road Rash, it takes its liberties and brings the craziness up to 11, sometimes potentially a little too much for some players. But most people should be able to enjoy what it offers, the spirit of Road Rash is definitely there. And as soon as we can get proper online multiplayer, I'm sure this will be one kickass game with tons of laughs to be had.-----------------------------------------------------------ORIGINAL:Not quite yet!I backed the Kickstarter project and I'm REALLY looking forward to the final product...... But the current build (like every build before it) is virtually unplayable, the performance is simply laughable. Now, there's a lot happening on the screen, but with how ugly the game looks, the performance isn't even remotely justified.I'm sure the game will turn out to be an amazing piece of work at launch (and even during development once the performance is fixed). Hell, I've even had a lot of fun with it the few times when it didn't run at a single frame per second. But right now, you'd be better off saving your money. Because all you'd be doing is pay for a game you can't really play yet. Bugs and the likes, that's what Early Access is all about. Getting players to help out to some extent, during the development. But when it's only marginally playable at all, then it just becomes a little pointless. So keep your eyes on the game, it's bound to be awesome. But it's not quite there yet.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

With that being said, I don't think it needs to be Road Rash. I think it's a pretty solid game. The graphics are great, it's getting smoother and smoother with every new update, and the local co-op is an absolute blast. I still haven't gotten through the campaign+ mode but I feel like this game has great replayability. I seriously can't wait for the multiplayer and I'll hopefully update this when it comes out.

								Fun game to fill some gaps in time, if you got around 20 minutes to spare. Takes some getting used to, but once it you get it, it becomes much more enjoyable.It is a little steep @ $20, but if they add more content to the game it could be worth it.This isn't the type of game you can sink 5 hours into at once right now, just short fun bursts.

								This game is incredible for just an Early Access Title. I played a small demo at PAX South tonight, and bought the early access as soon as I got home. I met some really friendly developers, they were super helpful about the game and its ins and outs. Can't recommend this game enough, tight controls, fun mechanics, it's obvious a lot of work and love went into making it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Simply great fun. The frame smoothness has improved considerably since I purchased it and the gameplay is quick and effective -that's exactly what a fun racing game needs as the overall aim is not to spend hours tinkering with obscure options but just to get out on the road, race and destroy.  Well worth its price tag.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I remember this game from the GameBoy Advanced and i thought it was a cool concept back then, it was just really hard for me. When i saw this I had to get it and am so glad I did. This is the type of game you can jump on for 5 minutes to let off some stress, but can also get lost in and play for hours on end seeking revenge. No other game like it.

								This game is just plain FUN!  It not only harkens back to Road Rash, but all the arcade games that were easy to get into and gave you that thrill, whether you beat it or it beat you.  You'll notice I haven't played much so far but even if it never gets out of EA, I feel I've gotten my money's worth.  As an aging gamer, my hand-eye is far from what it used to be so I really stink at this game. I can't even get to 3rd place and die more than I survive but I keep going back for more.  To me, that's the mark of a great game.  I've basically moved into walking simulators, point-and-click adventures, and The Long Dark, but I will be re-energizing my heart with this arcade gem in between.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								A great spirit successor to Road Rash. I remember being addicted to that game and renting it several times from blockbuster when I was a kid, and this brings me back to that. I hope in the future they begin adding more bikes and continuing to tweak gameplay. The one thing I would say that detracts from the game is: No Wheelies! Now, I'm not sure if this is supposed to be a some type of Road Rash spawnchild, but I remember being able to wheelie over vehicles in Road Rash. I hope that is added in the future amongst other things. Great game though, thanks for the nostalgia.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								AAA studios could learn from this game, it is insanely fun for early access. I noticed some people had some complaints of the physics but honestly they are hilarious and random so it totally adds to the games dumb fun. Also this is not an easy game at first, it takes time to get Exp and Money to help advance further. Thankfully nothing feels tedious but the new game plus is REALLY hard right now but a worthy challenge. Maybe with a campaign mode and a strong multiplayer this game could really go far, it is great as is and EA is a bunch of morons sitting on the Road Rash Licence and not taking advantage of a true gem in gaming history. I could say a ton more but overall this game is great and worth the buy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Great fun, and as everyone else, it's definitely got a lot of Road Rash's gameplay, but it does build upon the base game with a talent tree and such.  I wouldn't say it is worth the full price right now (July 2015, Early Access), but certainly is worth grabbing on sale.  If/when they add in online multiplayer (local-only right now), I think the value will increase.Compared to many Early Access games, it's fairly polished, but there's a lot that still needs work in the game.Some of the physics create dumb situations where you can get stuck, even with the jump jets. There's also the oddity of being able to steer while in mid-air - realism vs fun aside, this leads to an easier game than it should be.The menus are very primitive in appearance, and the UI sound effects could use a lot of work, as they break immersion. It's also non-intuitive to exit the game properly - you can't do it unless you're in a race that's going on, which should be allowed, but shouldn't be the only way!I'd love to see more progress in being able to buy/unlock new bikes/costumes, even be able to paint things the colors you'd like.

								Quite a fun game! It's quite fascinating, how much fun it could be riding motorcycles and smashing people over the head with blunt objects. I feel like the driving could be more smooth, (Turning, un-stuckerizing yourself) since the whole game is based off of driving and all. But I mean it really doesn't change the fact that it's a super fun game overall. The game is still in early access, of course, but as of now I'd stick to buying it while it's on sale.

								Spritual successors are popular it seems, such as this homage to Road Rash. As others have stated; it's not road rash, not a bad thing though. Racing while on acid, as hallucinogenic cars fall from the sky, is neat; until you hit one. The game is actually in pretty good shape for being early access, though I would like more bikes and riders, but that could be in the works. Biggest complaint is having been clipped into a car (only twice so far), and just had to sit back and enjoy the ride.+I got a notification that I killed Pewdiepie.+Murderface achievement (Dethklok reference)+Putting C4 on other motorists, and getting blown up with them for staying too close.+Regular patches for improvements and/or fixing bugs-Not many bikes or riders available yet-Physics can be ""interesting""-I got a notification that I killed Pewdiepie, yet he is still alive.
