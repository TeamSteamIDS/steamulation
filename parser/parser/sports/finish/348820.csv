												Great game for the true Speedway fan. So far I really like itPositives:+ Great graphics.+ Commentary can be silly at times, but it's funnier this way.+ It's hard. Even in arcade mode. You're bound to crash a lot when you first start out.+ Stadiums are truly phenomenal and you can feel the atmosphere of the croud.+ Bike setup, different traction at different parts of the track throughout the raceNegatives:- My Dual Shock 4 controller (that works with every other game) will not work with this title when racing (otherwise it works fine in menus).- Lackluster career mode. I wish you could create your own driver, go through SGP qualifications and then advance on to become the best. Or at least use your own customized driver- It's about the 2015 season which is well over by now. Maybe a 2016 DLC?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are into racing games or really like speedway this game is a lot of fun. I would not recommend it to anyone else becase of the difficulty and it can be completed in a few days. Most people should just wait for it to be on sale to check it out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Being a speedway fan (hence the profile picture) I have been waiting for a game like this for a long long time. It is so much better than the ride and sliders game on the un supported web. Its hard, I haven't won a race yet, but I have some amazing cutbacks and round the outside bend 2 and 3. It can be tedious but it is very very good. I suppose I might not have won a race becuase im playing as Nicki Pedersen... But thats just my opinion. If you are a speedway supporter or even rider I reccomend the game!(And just for the record Eastbourne Eagles rule!)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a fun game, but not easy!The winner of every round is determined in a lot of small, thrilling and sweaty heats of 4 laps.And you need to earn money to be able to look after your bike.Buy better parts to be more competitive, but also to repair the bike after every round.Parts that degrade or breaks in the heats can be replaced if you have spare parts.Nice graphics, but I do miss visual customization of your clothes and the bike, would also have been nice to be able to create your own rider..And the sound, especially the commentator is extremely repetitive!!

												Such amazing little game! Never been a fan of Speedway but i can tell you, after playing this i now love the sport!Graphics looks great. Just wish there would be more mud flying around and impair your vision and making a mess of things, but no biggy.The bikes are great fun to ride and it feels really good slinging it round the corners!I would like to see a greater emphasis on the career mode for the next game. Like creating your own rider and work your way up from a lower classed Grand Prix.All in all i can't recommend this game enough for any fan of two wheelers!/Hugs and Kisses			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, I'm a huge speedway fan. I've met with Greg Hancock in person three times, with the whole USA Team two times including Billy Hamill and Sam Ermolenko. I also had the pleasure to meet with Nicki Pedersen, Jason Crump, Hans Andersen, Martin Smolinski and many great riders from Poland to the Czech Republic, from Germany to Hungary, from Croatia to Denmark. I have a wall at home dedicated to this sport and jeez, my window looks to the Speedway Arena of Miskolc. So yes, I know a bit about this sport.I play with speedway games since Extreme Speedway Challange which came out before the first official FIM Speedway Grand Prix 1 in 2000. I prayed many times that someday there will be a great and enjoyable speedway game out there. And here it is, the FIM Speedway Grand Prix 15 is far the best game in this genre and a must have for all speedway fans. To be honest Speedway Liga was great too but the riding experience is far the best in this new game.The only thing I miss is a career mode where you can have you own driver and bike. The best would be if they can implement some leagues and SEC or SWC too but I know this isn't so easy because of the licensing issues.Nevertheless hats down to Softplanet, they created the best speedway game which is a true rival for MXGP and other motorsport games. Well done, good job! And never forget while you play, no brakes, no gears, no fear! ;-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't usually review games but this deserves one, the Fim Grand Prix series has certainly come along way with this one compared to the older ones, but this just goes to a whole new levelI did however have difficulties getting the game to start but after a few updates on graphics drivers it soon powered upI'm not going to go into depth with the game but it is certainly a must buy for the avid speedway fan like myself and also for the people who enjoy racing games you have two different controlling modes Arcade and Simulation which arcade is pretty easy and after falling off the bike over 100 times to get use to the simulation setting and finally complete 4 laps  I was ready to to attempt the Grand Prix I chose The Grin because Come on who doesn't love Greg! Graphics are awesome and the bike decals and the l  kevlars match that of the real thing!I do recommend not going straight into the races without first practicing and getting the set up on your bike just right yeah the track changes after every 4 heats but the racing line doesn't change that much that extra 10psi in your tyres can make all the difference from having a comfy win or a battle to score a single point. Unlike the older games they've finally sorted out the mechanics of going into corners where as before your bike would be well over a 45Â° angle before it realises it need to kick the back wheel out on this it's smooth I could write more but tbh you're best bet is to just buy the game and experience it for yourself!Good job Techland!!
