												Fun! Similar to Wii Sports, solid no glitches, gave me a little work out, need more rounds and AI opponents in boxing, also in baseball maybe add some basehits, doubles and triples in the mix and not just have homers and outs.  Overall fun game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wouldn't recommend this game. The soccer mini-game is frustrating and very often you will feel like you blocked a ball when it just goes straight through your gloves instead. The basketball game should really have more than a timed 3 pt shootout. It would be more fun to shoot from anywhere. Bowling is good actually. Homerun derby is really not taking advantage of vr, it's something that was done on the wii over 10 years ago. Not really something you should advertise as ""brand new""... The shooting mini-game is a huge waste of time. It doesn't feel very polished at all, and gets boring quickly. The japanese archery is alright, but there are better archery games on steam, some of them for free. Boxing feels very unnatural, and is totally outshined by ""Thrill of the Fight"", which does boxing very well in vr. I am disappointed in this game to say the very least. Sorry.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Got this game from a giveawayThe game is itself is very entertaining and challenging. The mini games are well designed and easy to play. But the game still lacks multiplayer options compared to Wii sports which is the most important point of having sports games... Some of the mini games has several issues. For example, Clay Shooting is way too hard and holding the gun with both hands is buggy ; Bowling is unfriendly for players with a small play area ( the rack is so far back). Hope it can be fixed Let's see if the updates will add more modes or settings to improve its replayability or not			",1097,350,39,130,137,15,151
