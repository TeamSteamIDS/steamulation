								Well why would you pay 13 euros instead of downloading and setting up some free DAW with some free drums VST? That way you could actually learn how to create music on your computer.And this shouldn't cost more than 3, maybe 4 euros.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Full disclosure: So when I first saw this game on steam I thought: WTF is this. So I got it (from a bundle) just so I could find out what it is and to make this review. First of. I play drums for hobby. And have done so for years. Meanwhile I've also accumulated a huge collection of audio software (VST, DAW, fx, etc) and misc instruments. Review: Is this a game or music software? Short answer is neither. For a game there is no actual gameplay. And is therefore classified as a “simulator”. And for a virtual instrument (VST) it perform very bad. Focusing more on the visuals of the drums rather than the sound. I have yet to try and use DvDrum with any of my midi instruments and controllers. If you want to make music. Then you are better off buying something else. Such as EzDrummer which is cheap, and easy to use. Do not BUY. There are better options for free..Edit 1: Went back and tried it to check out all the new updates. The midi and joystick is simple to get going, however. You can only use 1 midi device at a time. And there is no default controller layout for midi device or the controller. Which require yourself to set them all up. Personally I would also find it nice if you had controller options for each device as you can quickly fill up the 4 available spaces with multiple controllers and devices. A common feature in drum VST's that I would like implemented is being able to hit the drums and cymbals using the mousewheel. And depending on where you hit the drum/cymbal it will play softer or louder.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								DvDrum is a drum simulator where you played it with keyboard (I haven't try it using other devices). The improvement in this Steam version is really good from previous non-Steam version, especially at saving and loading your own keymap, soundset, and drum kit. (If you are non-Steam DvDrum user, you know that feel)Personally, I think the main focus on this ""game"" is customization.You can customize your desired keymap for your controller, customize your drum kit that will be displayed, and also customize the sound set of the drum that included in-game sound mixer (screenshot provided in Store Page).This game is good for practicing drum, so some feature are:-In-game metronome, you can set your metronome so you can practice at your tempo while you drumming.-Embed music, while you playing drum, you can add a music in game and played it on background. Perhaps you want to practice covering some song? (Beware, if you playing with keyboard, some song is too hard to cover)Other than that, the in-game drum sound is so great.Also, MAY causing lag in the ""game"" window when you played and/or recorded it with video recorder software. Be sure to close unnecessary background process.And here's my personal feedback/suggest:More simplified the UI (Also, the fonts too, if possible. If not, then it's okay)The main menu song is too loud!Taking screenshot with Steam doesn't work, even there's Steam Overlay. (There's a taking image, in-game feature, but that's limited to taking drum kit screenshot only, not the whole screen)You can record your ""game""play (video/audio), but you must set it first in main menu Settings. Also, you must have your own video/audio recording software, seems that this feature is useless[?].When you open this ""game"", then play it, the keymap doesn't load properly. Sometimes, the keymap back to default. The only thing to solve this, is to open the Keys >> Settings >> Return. Then it should set to your own saved keymap.Maybe the option to change resolution?Add shortcut/fix about placing/moving drum/decor part, I don't know, maybe by dragging middle-click?.Why? For example, when you ""accidently"" move your Toms beside the Toms panel like this: http://s6.postimg.org/s3qfh09dt/Screenshot_1.jpg , I can't move it again, probably because the button is conflicted?.........
