												The physics in this game are awful. HoopsVR is the gold standard and this game doesn't even get the bronze. It feels more like you're throwing a shopping bag than a basketball. Very disappointed. Hopefully they can work on this and make it feel more realistic. Right now, throwing a full court shot feels exactly like throwing a 10 foot shot. Awful.			",25,6,3,2,15,7,0

												NBA 2K VR Experience Gameplay and first 30 minute impressions and video review:


YouTube™ Video: NBA2K VR EXPERIENCE GAMEPLAY ON HTC VIVE - NBA Basketball VR game with intense arcade style! 

			Views: 3,540		

			Lets play the NBA 2K VR Experience on HTC Vive today, a Virtual Reality Basketball game with cool and intense arcade style and great graphics!		

NBA2KVR is made entirely for VR and contains different single player game challenges, skill gameplay modes, tutorial elements as well as local multiplayer support to enjoy NBA2K VR together with your friends at home! This arcade-style NBA2K game in Virtual Reality has roomscale support, but its of course not a full basketball game with full gameplay and matches. Its more of a challenging basketball scenario-game full of funny game modes, skill shots, trickshots etc. that you can practice, gain points on and have fun with together with friends or just playing alone. NBA2KVR Experience has great graphics, perfect sound and sountracks, very good presence in-game, good control system using the HTC Vive wireless motion controllers and it really feels immersive in many ways. If you play basketball in real life, or just enjoy the sport, I think you should really give it a try as its - so far - the best Basketball VR Experience out there!I really hope they will add more gameplay modes in this game, and I will continue this review as soon as I have been playing some more and as soon as more content is added. But so far, im recommending this game to everyone of you that likes basketball - this is a cool experience!CheersSweViver			",87,20,3,0,21,6,1
