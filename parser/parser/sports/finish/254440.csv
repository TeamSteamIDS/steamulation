												Sometimes, you need a game that's frenetic, fast paced and full of chaos.  You need some escapism so you get away from the humdrum of your day job by pretending to be some beefcake named Slab Rockhard blast some bugs to bits with your AK - 22.  Other times though, you need to come home, kick back, crack a brewski and chill out.  Take it easy, shoot some pool like a pro and relax.  That's what you have Pool Nation for.  It's zero pressure, it's zero chaos. It's 100% cool, daddy-o.  It's got some great physics too, so you can shoot pool and feel like a king. Because some times, you need to come home and pretend that you're a slick mo-fo pool shark.  Because if you tried to play pool in the real world, people would realize you're a 40 year old dork in dad jeans try his damnedest to look cool. I uh...that may have gotten too personal.

												Pool Nation isn't a perfect pool game, but it's a huge step up from what's come before. If you're not already a billiards fan, Pool Nation won't make you one. Conversely, for those dying to scratch the billiards itch, Pool Nation is sure to satisfy. An entertaining, highly varied and technically excellent pool game, even if lacking in innovation or new elements for its genre.With Pool Nation you'll get a pooling experience that you've never had before. The simulator delivers several game modes and a lot of options to choose from. Every kind of shot that you can imagine is possible to make in the game and because of that you can truly speak of a great simulator. Another big plus are the graphics, which are truly stunning for a low budget title. Overall, Cherry Pop Games's first endeavour has left us with a fantastic billiards game featuring stunning visuals, great audio and even better physics. The lengthy, albeit difficult career mode, will give you plenty of play time but perhaps for the wrong reasons. If you're looking for a realistic, stylish, and fun billiards game, Pool Nation is the cream of the crop.			",2254,865,87,235,310,22,348

												Pool Nation is one of my favorite games on Steam. The solid gameplay and controls were not enough for Cherry Pop Games, they went ahead and added some beautiful locations each offered during day, sunset, and neon lit night time. The amazing soundtrack gets you in the mood whether you want to relax or get pumped. The game modes for single player include 3ball, 8ball, 9ball, endurance, golf, killer, rotation, speed, and straight. In addition, you can play online versus friends in a friendly match or choose to be competitive in tournament mode. The most recent update includes ""box of tricks"" free of charge, allowing you to create a custom trick shot that you can share with the world. This game is the complete package.

												Pool Nation is a great pool simulator that will make you feel like a hustler once you master all the different trick shots. Lots of different game modes like 9-ball, 8-ball, endurance, and tournaments. Plus you can play online versus friends. The game offers good graphics, although they can be a little bit on the shiny side. The cue control system is mostly user friendly even though sometimes it can feel like a chore to set up a trick shot just right. Straight shots are extremely intuitive and the angle assistance makes it really easy to sink shots. Although bank shots and combos aren't so straightforward.This is the first real pool game that I have played on the PC and quite frankly I wouldn't be surprised if it was the last. I just don't know how it can get any better. The game trailers and screenshots really sold me before my purchase and the game certainly has not disappointed--really well done. The only blemish is that it occassionally crashes.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												One of the best pool sim to come along since the Virtual pool series.  The developers are a small group working out of Manchester, England and they do a whale of a job listening to their players.  They frequent all of the forum and community hub sites and update when needed.  They really do care about their product and want to make it the best sim on the market and to my opinion they have succeeded.  This game is a really ""must have"" for the serious and not so serious pool gamer.  Cheap and twice the price but well worth looking into...buy this game!			",164,42,31,8,24,7,13

 “8-Ball - Corner Pocket” ‘Pool Nation’ is a fun, polished Billiards simulator and a bargain at its $1 pricetag (Steam Fall Sale 2014). Released as the maiden offering from Cherry Pop Games, it’s gorgeous visuals, multiple game modes, lengthy campaign and lots of unlockables will keep Pool fans coming back for more.   Campaign | Gameplay: Gamers have the choice of playing standard 8-ball or variations like 9-ball, Rotation, Endurance, Sudden Death etc across a variety of visually stunning locations / pool halls. A lengthy campaign mode (against AI opponents) allows you to perfect your game and strive toward numerous unlockables including new locations, pool table decals, new ball styles and cue styles. Additionally, the online mode allows you to match up with friends or other online players in single matches, Tournaments or King of the Hill events. Multiple difficulty levels (from Novice to Pro), a spot on physics engine, responsive controls, and a great soundtrack make this the best Pool game to date.Flaws: In considering its biggest issues – 1. Game Stability is poor (Tabbing to windows results in an insta-crash) and 2. Online Gaming is largely dead (Bring your own friends). Additionally, the developers have pushed the previously promised ‘Trick Shot’ mode to the next release, and the lack of Co-op play is disappointing as well.Overall, ‘Pool Nation’ is the best conception of a Billiards game to date and fans of the real game will find this a fun, polished distraction. But, even ardent fans soon realize that Pool without the smoky basement rooms, uneven cues, pitchers of beer, chatty girls, side-bets and bar-room trash talk, is a somewhat hollow experience.

												I remember a few months ago when it was on sale and i thought it would be one of those games that i buy and dont even play, And even when it was only a few euros, i didnt buy it!I was wrong....My boyfriend remembered that moment too and he recently gifted me the game.We've been playing it A LOT ever since.The game looks absolutely stunning! There is so much detail in this game.The controlles are easy to use, Its easy for beginners but you can make it more challenging for yourself if you want too, when your getting better. There are so many options in this game which makes it an awesome pool game for everybody. Yes, Also when you dont know anything about pooling lol. In single mode you can unlock different Rooms, Balls, Tables and so much more.Which is cool because you can make it totally as you want it to look, also online against your friends.That brings me too the  biggest plus of this game... The multi player option!Playing against others works great, but the sad part is that not many people play this game which makes it not so easy to find people to play a match with.So if you want to play it online i recommend that you find a friend on your friendlist to play it with.This game which i thought would get boring quickly turned out to be really addictive and extremely fun.Its even THAT good that i write a review for it and thats something that i rarely do.Its a must have, And since its on sale again at this moment i would say its worth to give it a try. You'll be amazed, I promise ;]			",968,444,29,91,142,14,115

												A fantastic pool simulator. Frustratingly accurate! Turn off the assists for a proper experience but I warn you... It is frustratingly addictive. The A.I opponents will make quick work of you for making small errors in the later tournaments but it certainly isn't unfair. Just like real pool sometimes you will let your shot go & know you have messed up as soon as the cue touches the whiteball.			",172,27,7,17,17,3,33

												Best pool simulator on steam.I really enjoy pool games like the miniclip's 8 ball pool I have on my phone and computer. This game is really awesome cause it even has workshop for special tracks you can make for balls as you unlock more stuff winning games in singleplayer. Truly an amazing game. And if you like taking screenshots, this might be the game for you aswell. You can take some really nice screenshots during through the campaign in singleplayer. The graphics are truly amazing.And even multiplayer? Woah! This is too cool to be thruth! All this needs now is local co-op versus mode.-={You can buy this game for 1$ on♥♥♥♥♥ Its safe, I bought it there.}=-Pros: +Much custumization +Awesome graphics +No lag +Multiplayer +Trading cards +Full and good controller support +Workshop +Tricks/Stunts +Much to do. +No time limit while you choose which ball to hit and the angle.Cons: -Sometimes it bugs out. (For me - once it bugged out menu screen. Not a big problem) -If you play with mouse it might not be so good. I recommend controller.9/10			",167,24,22,9,24,4,4

												This is one of the best pool games i have seen. Graphics look nice, the physics are good and it's pretty fun. A strange thing is the uncomfortable mouse controls, but i played with a xbox controller, what works very well.But now: Devs abandonned this game. They promised a snooker mode. There is none. They took ages to get the update for the trickshot mode which is basically a lure into buying dlc. This mode is also unpolished, as there was never an update again. And it should have been in the game for release. Well that's ok, i rather wait, than having an unfinished mode. Still no update or the promised snooker mode. Yeah bla bla small dev team...but:There is no reaction of the devs anymore in the forums. So they are planning on bringing a new game (which already is out on xbox) to pc, that is (at least in my opinion) what this game should have been and what we all paid for. But wait, it will cost you extra as it is a standalone game. The fact, that they promised the owners of this game an ""upgrade"" discount does not make it any better. So i say:Do NOT buy this!Such a dev team is not worth your hard earned money. And as there might be the ""real"" version of this game out, this is worth waiting for if you really want it. Might just take another year or so...			",216,33,17,26,50,6,46

												An excellent pool simulator with great physics and excellent controls (both M+WASD and gamepad work very well). It has an extensive career mode, free mode, fun challenges with unusual game types, tournaments, and online multi-player mode. Pool Nation is gorgeous - right down the the details in the fabric. The only negative in presentation is that your opponents are disembodied as are you; no physical presentation of the players in the game. There are also no spectators. You play in these gorgeous modern venues with seating for dozens or even hundreds, but they are entirely empty.As someone who has had a slate pool table in my home for most of my life, I find this a compelling simulation and well worth the few dollars of the asking price.

AUDIOElectronicaVISUALDazzlingDIFFICULTYSharp Learning CurveVIBEChillCRAVINGBilliardsON SALEDiscountedPROS: Solid pool simulator with reasonably-dependable multiplayer. Fun single-player tournament mode. Game has a fair amount of complexity not offered in other similar games allowing players to pull off cool shots. CONS: Game has the tendency to occasionally glitch out. Planned features appear to be on an indefinite hiatus, and much-needed updates haven't happened. A bit tough to get a more advanced grasp on the controls. A lot of balls will fly off the table before you get a good feel for what will happen.WORTH: With how badly Pool Nation is beginning to fall apart and how sparingly things get addressed, I'd say wait for a sale. The developer has switched focus to other projects, so I wouldn't hold my breath for this version to come to full fruition.OVERALL: A fun game to share with friends, and it goes on sale for 1.00-2.00USD rather often. The game seems to have an active community, though it has been hard for me personally to get in touch with players I've reached out to. Hoping to see more updates.SCORE:7/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon ",309,150,6,54,38,3,41

												Right off the bat, one thing that will catch your attention is the variety of game types.  Most billiards games like to focus only on either 8- or 9-ball.  Those games are here, but they do not stop at that.  Along the game, other games like Rotation and Golf are in the mix.  With nine different ways currently available with Snooker and Trick coming soon, there are plenty of ways to play.Another strong point about the game is the controls.  Like in any other pool game, being able to control the cue ball is important.  Most games simply allow you to aim the ball and adjust the power.  Even though most games stop at this, there are more options to offer.  By being able to adjust the angle of the cue stick as well as where on the cue ball to aim, it gives the option of doing jump and swerve shots, something most billiard games leave out.  Additionally, with a full tutorial teaching how to do all of these moves, it does not take long before they become second nature.Beyond all the gameplay details, a nice touch about the game is the amount of customization available.  Even games that try to simulate pro billiards tend to stick to a single, sometimes sponsored look throughout the game.  This one goes beyond the basics.  As soon as you start a game, the highly detailed and moving locals make it feel like you are in what could be a real location.  As you keep progressing, at least a dozen locals, cue sticks, ball sets, and even table decals make it that regardless your taste, there is plenty to see even from a visual standpoint.Once the single-player game is over, there is still more to play.  Through online multiplayer, it is possible to keep playing with others.  It is even possible to create tournaments to learn who the best player is.  However, the one drawback is that there is no local multiplayer mode available.  This means that in order to play with another person in the same room, the two of you must play through a network.  This feels like a major oversight.  A simple hot seat patch would have made that the game could be a great party game.  Even without local multiplayer, this is still a great package that any billiards fan can easily enjoy.			",2671,1105,99,291,293,32,439

Visually it is amazing and is an all round enjoyable game. You can play with a friend and having a nice game of pool. Are take a tournament by storm and listen to some tunes while your at it. I never thought I would buy a pool game but for £1.04 it was so worth it. It is definetely worth even £7. I recommend giving this game a go.

												The difficulties I have with Pool Nation start in the fact that I already know ho to play pool. I will explain: The english in Pool Nation does not accurately represent the way in which a ball would travel with said spin. Top and bottom english when making a cut shot can cause the cue ball to travel more left or right on the deflection, and this is not represented at all.Left/right english isn't actually as useful on a pool table as an amateur might think. I rarely use left/right english in real pool, as top/bottom english can account for most necessary ball control.As I can best explain it: Top and bottom english account most for how the cue ball deflects off the object ball, and left/right english effects the way the cue ball deflects off rails. There is a small amount of effect with left/right on ball deflection, and top/bottom on rail deflection, but it is very slight.This has to do with the fact that the rail is a solid unmovable force, and ball deflection is sympathetic to mass/friction.My previous pool experience makes this game very unintuitive!

												Hands down the best Pool game out there. Beautiful textures, great physics and enough variation in games to keep you busy for a while. Best of all it runs great on my old-as-dirt PC.Multiplayer is a blast, especially if you can get a group together for a tournament. The free roaming camera allows for amazingly framed shots when you are brodcasting the game. Your spectators won't get bored!Multiple levels of difficulty are present, and should gbe used if you are looking for a challenge. The novice mode is only good for the first few rounds, as it reveals quite a bit of the ball paths. My only complaint here is that champion mode perhaps reveals too much as well (Cue ball only).Tricks shots are a blast to pull of and never get old. Experimenting with angles and english prove to be highly satisfying. Especially when you pot the winning shot with a knifes edge. Looking forward to the new mode: Box of Tricks, and maybe Trading cards? (wink wink).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't really try to take this game too seriously. I mostly play it when I need to think or if I'm planning a grocery list.But in all seriousness, it has decent ball physics and there's a true to life satisfaction when sinking the balls in order and never sinking the cue ball. Love every second of it.My only complaint is there's only one background, I'd love to play in a smoky cafe or bar with moody light and a lit cigar on the counter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I play pool in real life and I must say, the physics are just as awesome as the visuals. However, the developers seem to only care about money. Just read the reviews on Pool Nation FX and you'll understand. Promised tons of great things with this game, only to drop it and make the same game with a new title. You had something great on your hands, CP, and you b**** slapped us all with it, then threw away the glove. If you have friends to play this with then it's totally worth it but that's about it, since no one plays this online anymore.			",52,19,0,1,1,2,2

												Pool Nation is one of the most polished indie games of 2013- the animations are shiny and smooth, the gameplay is responsive and the physics are realistic. You won't find yourself screaming at this game for bouncing your balls in the wrong direction, or glitching out and dropping your cue ball through the table. With eleven game modes including tournaments, online play, and single-player endurance mode; as well as a slew of collectables to unlock, Pool Nation has no shortage of goodies to keep gameplay fresh.The single player component revolves primarily around tournaments where you take on AI challengers of ever increasing difficulty. Each match has an associated list of challenges, and completing them unlocks a variety of cosmetic changes like cues and balls. Standard games like 9 ball are present along with more interesting options like Golf, which challenges you to put specific balls into specific pockets. There’s also a time attack style mode, where balls spawn on the table and you have to sink as many as possible in the time limit. There are Free Play, Versus, and Online modes present too, but I had a hard time finding anyone to challenge online.Pool Nation is a great looking game that features bright and shiny graphics that makes each game, literally, feel new and different. There are some good themes on the game's soundtrack, and though the game's controls look difficult to use, they aren't difficult to learn. There are also options that can be easily turned on or off to give players assists in a game including arrows that point at the next balls that need to be hit or arrows that show where a ball will travel when hit. All of these features combine to make an excellent presentation for Pool Nation. But is it fun? In short stints I definitely enjoyed playing the game, but it isn’t the type of thing I’d want to play for hours at a time. Having said that, I think Pool Nation is the kind of experience that would be a hit at a house party. If you’ve been searching far and wide for a Billiards simulator, and don’t have room for an actual table, Pool Nation is probably the solution. The physics are solid, the controls allow for extreme fine tuning of shots, and everything looks super shiny. A few more game types would be welcome, but for $10 Pool Nation is the gold standard in the category.

												- All Racked Up -I quite enjoy Pool Nation.I find something soothing about it.Of course, I'm an avowed novice (I just loves my crutches), who would rather chat and play, in a more languid sorta way, than be champ. (Though, if by some miracle, I were to become champ, it would be sooo cool.)I mean, there's something very gratifying about being on a 6 ball streak, while carrying on a casual conversation, with friends, about the stupid decisions the characters on Walking Dead make.But, play on any other setting and I'd have to put on my ugly old game face and actually concentrate on each shot, and...well, I don't wanna.Oh yeah, I've also recently discovered that it's a wonderful little comedown after a long hard evening of pulling ""overkill"" jobs in Pay Day 2, as well.However...On the other hand, the game can be a bit glitchy.Like, it won't let me exit.  It asks me if I would like to exit, I say yes, and then it just sits there blankly looking at me.I almost always have to close it via task manager.Even worse, there was a point, early on, where it would just shut down and chuck me onto my desktop.  Once, it actually crashed as I was hitting the 8 ball in for a win.Thank goodness, that seems to have stopped, though the exit problem still persists. It's a minor glitch, which alone, will certainly not stop me from playing.I mean, it would be nice if they'd fix it... but, honestly, in my mind, task manager has pretty much become the default mode of exit now, anyway.Note: I bought this during a Steam sale for less than half the regular price.  A fact that  has, of course, influenced this rating. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pick up and play pool fun with beautiful detail throughout! I have been looking for a good pool game for years, being a long time fan of the very early ""Yahoo Pool"" (was the only thing I did with Yahoo) I have been hunting ever since. This game retails for $9.99 but I got it for the week long sale for $1.49, I feel it's easily worth the retail price. If you are a fan of pool, and are looking for a legit game to play with friends, make sure you all buy this one, then let me know so we can play together!UPDATE: 7-29-14 I had some questions and suggestions for this game so I popped into the community hub to ask them. I wanted a lobby system where people could link up and pick rooms, and servers to play in with friends. I wanted it more social (like old yahoo pool) where you could have many people watching, chatting in the chat box and getting ready to play winner. Well, after asking the question I heard back from the developers. They in fact are working on a new pool game where these features will be featured. They are re creating a pool game engine from the ground up to allow these features. I am excited for THAT game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hey guys, thanks for reading my reviews. Let me make this as plain as possible. If you like pool and can find this cheap, check it out. It's not bad at all. I think the controls are better here in many ways than I've seen in previous PC pool games, but what's the game really like? You get nine ball, eight ball, and a few mini-games. There is a trick mode that hasn't been put into the game yet apparently. The humor is painful mostly, but not always bad. Just never very clever or subtle.As for the negative stuff: I think it gets repetitious. It's also buggy. I don't like the AI at all, as it sometimes seems too transparent what's happening in the game. Some of the rounds a really good AI player will goof several times in a row to give me a chance to beat it. Other times it feels like it's cheating to win.  Sometimes the match challenges don't appear to count properly or are too literally applied, and it seems inconsistant with its application of what meets the requirements of a given challenge. For example, I played a match that wanted me to get a 3 ball streak with a jump shot. I got a 4 ball streak with a jump at the end and it didn't count it. The next time I played, it seemed to count it. So I just don't trust the AI at all. Also, some of the designer ball sets that you can unlock confuse me visually because the stripes and solids look too similar to me from a distance. The settings are very colorful, which isn't necessarily bad, but can be VERY loud. Anyway, even though this seems a negative review, it's not meant to be. The devs say they are working to improve it, and if they do I think it has a lot of potential. As it is, if you can get it for a very low price and you like pool, try it. I've enjoyed playing it, but it can be frustrating at times.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like pool, this is your best (and only) option on steam. It looks great and sounds great technically and stylistically. There are nearly no loading times after you start the game, making beginning and playing games as fast as you want it to be. For playing pool itself, there are lots of easy to use but hard to master options for doing more tricky shots. Curve balls, jump balls, bank balls. It's all there and can be executed with serious precision. Even when you knock a ball clean off the table, the satisfying crunch on the floor makes a failed shot sound so sweet.There's really not much that can be done to improve this game. The only trouble I've had with this game is using the replay function and the online multiplayer isn't very active, but the core game is as solid as an 8-ball. If you have any interest in video game pool, this is as good as it gets.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pool Nation delivers a solid billiards simulation experience.  It makes the grade in the areas critical to this type of game:  the physics are sound,the shot-making is clean, and there's enough variety in the game types to keep things fresh for a while.  On top of that, the game is downright beautiful.There are some flaws, but nothing game-breaking.  The most glaring (for me, anyway) was that the game feels literally empty.  When shooting, you're shooting in a seemingly deserted hall.  There's no crowd, no opponent squirming in the chair as you knock the balls down.  Speaking of your opponents, while their descriptions are modestly humorous, there's little to differentiate them from one to the next.  At times it feels a bit sterile.  Again, this isn't really game-breaking.  But part of the allure of playing at the bar or hall is the atmosphere, and the game is lacking in that regard.All in all, though, the plusses outweigh the minuses.  If you're a billiards enthusiast, this game is just about value for money at full price and a bargain if you can pick it up on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
