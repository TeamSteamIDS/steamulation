								My son and I love playing this game together co-op, and local co-op games are always our favorite since we can really play together. Loads of fun and high-fives after every goal.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is the product of what would happen if the fast-paced and thunderbolt world of Super Mario Strikers met the charming and intense world of Sensible Soccer. Sprinkle some unforgettable scenes from Shaolin Soccer and you have Kopanito All-Stars Soccer. Impressions+ I have never had so much fun slide tackling in to opponents. Traditional grassroot rules do not apply, so get out there and break those legs!+ Gameplay is solid and fully responsive between keyboard and gamepad. There is a learning curve involved, but once you discover the importance of team work, dribbling and tackling, everything feels a lot friendlier. + Visually a very charming game. The cartoony art direction is certainly a good call and works well. Player animations are solid. Goal celebrations are... ahem... animated. + Not a lot to offer in terms of sound effects and soundtrack, but the current offering delivers to a satisfactory standard.+ A large assortment of competitions to unlock and play through including custom tournaments, practice and friendly matches.+ Powers can be huge game changers and injects new life to the sport. There are four powers in total with individual strengths and weaknesses.+ Support for up to four additional local players. Grab your friend(s) and charge through various tournaments as a team.+ Full keyboard + mouse and gamepad support. Keys can be configured to your heart’s content.+ The greater the goal difference, the more resilient and alert the AI becomes to your tackles and dribbles. Something I have not seen before, but it's a mechanic which works extremely well in an attempt to avoid further catastrophes. + Leaderboard and fame points work really well side by side. Adds a whole different layer of depth for players to continue playing and reach the Platinum League.+ 225 achievements and in-game trophies. That’s 225 individual pieces of effort and excruciating dedication to unlock.+ Match challenges offer objectives for players in search of small modifiers (ie. avoid using powers, score three goals in 30 seconds, and so on). You gain fame points in return for your efforts.+ Friendly user interface with all the standard options you would expect from a PC title.+ Online multiplayer is planned for release with the final version of the game.Early access consideration and dev feedback- A friendly warning: The AI will torture you during your first few sessions/hours until you figure out how everything works. You may even grow suspicious of cheating AI. I most certainly did. The important thing is to try and play as much as you can to get to grips with the gameplay.- Slight overkill with AI catch up speed compared to player catch up. I don't feel like the sprint button does anything when chasing the AI.- The need for more power ups or other methods of scoring (ie. volley or header) is great.- There is an audio balancing issue. Almost all audio during play comes through the right speaker/headphone. I have tried using two perfectly functional headsets and a speaker to cancel any malfunctions on my end.- Only international teams are playable. It would be great to be able to play in a league filled with fictional teams/players, just to shrug off the feeling of international play. Pro Evolution Soccer has done this for many years with great success (ie. North London: Arsenal; Hampshire Red: Southampton; Merseyside Blue: Everton). - It would be an even greater feature to allow players the freedom to create their own teams, team names, players and kits from pre-made designs, then to incorporate this team to a randomly generated and fictional league.

ReviewIf you don't want to worry about team formation, tatics and you want to play quick and short soccer games, this game was made for you.Kopanito is a soccer game on Early Access that already has a lot of content:-16 tournaments and cups to play, but you can also create your own tournament.-100+ teams from all over the world.-4 AI difficulty levels-Super-moves-Achievements-Leaderboards-Controller supportIt's an extremely simple soccer game. You pick your team (5 players + 1 goal keeper) and you can play a friendly match or try to win a tournament or cup.There are no fouls, no referees, no team formation, no tatics, no stamina.The game has a smooth gameplay, you can tackle as much as you want, but that doesn't mean you're going to easily steal the ball.When you press and hold the kick button the game slows down and you can change the ball direction, making the goal keeper's life difficult.The super-moves are a nice addition to the game: you can freeze your opponent, you can use a magnet to pull the ball, you can teleport to another region of the field, you can perform a super shot or use a windmaker to blow the ball away from your goal.You can play locally with your friends: up to 5 local players, using gamepads and a keyboard.In the beginning you can play just one tournament. You need to win it on the Beginner level to unlock another tournament and so on.Even though the game has 100+ teams you can pick just a few in the beginning and you need to unlock the other teams.Rating:9/10Pros: Cartoony and cute graphics.Simple gameplay.Nice tutorial.Achievements.Short games.Fast pace.You can generate GIF from your goals. Cons:The team supporters are too quiet.The AI difficult needs balancing. From the Beginner to the Amateur level it gets way too difficult. The devs are already working on it.The ball rebounds needs improvement. It's hard control your player.Lack of multiplayer online, but the devs are already working on it.For similar reviews and great giveaways please visit Steamified[www.steamified.com] ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
