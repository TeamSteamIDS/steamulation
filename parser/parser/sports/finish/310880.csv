												This game isn't even close to being polished and ready to be sold. For starters the user manual is useless and I cannot find out how to sign free agents. Lots of spelling or grammar errors. Game randomly locks up and crashes. I wish Steam would offer refunds.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Basketball Pro Management 2015 has the very best of intentions. It really wants to be the Football Manager of basketball, and that's a great goal. That's exactly the kind of game I'm looking for. The problem here is lack of polish. To be less polite, Basketball Pro Management feels like a lump of carbon that has a long way to go until it turns to diamond.On the surface it has many of the FM features - right down to a 3D(ish) game engine. The problem is that they all feel 20% finished. It took FM many years to reach the stage it's at now, and I think the developers of Basketball Pro Management 2015 are trying to reach the moon before they learn to walk.Fast Break Pro Basketball (and college basketball) remain the best basketball simulators on the market.

												Very good game, the strategy involved will satisfy most players and can be challenging even for the best players! Beginners won't be lost as the game already includes plays but also allows you to create your own plays. The loading times are very short on my computer I can't complain. I'm also very pleased with the database and the number of playable leagues included in the game. The only complain I have is the lack of official licences both in Europe and NBA. However this can be easily fixed by using a database created by the fans which includes the real names as well as the official logos and photos for most clubs and players! I would recomend this game to whoever likes management games and especially to basketball fans.			",1,1,0,0,10,0,2

												I'm a huge fan of basketball and I love management sims like Football Manager so this was an easy buy for me. I have played it for about 10 hours now and I've reached the conclusion that though it is imperfect, it is an excellent sim. This is a game that should attract a fanatical following and the community (like in FM) should improve it by adding content such as new tactics.Well done stuff:Unbelievably they have all the exemptions (except the injured player exception) correct.You can balance out the play time and get advice from the coach. You will want to intervene here or the coach will try to play an older guy that is a star for 40+ minutes against even bad teams.You can add plays and call them. This works really well if you have a bad defending but fantastic 3 pt specialist. You can make sure he is on the perimiter, drive a player to the paint and toss the ball to one side of the court to draw off guards, and then funnel it to your player on the 3 point line. It works really well.You'll want to change your database to the uploaded ones with real player names in them. It is uploaded by users to the forums.Rough edges: There are a few small player management issues such as number of players in the off-season. I get the impression that teams don't have strategies for tanking if they are already eliminated which helps rebuilding.I'd like to be able to scout upcoming draft classes.There are some calendar issues with the game (for when a trade can be made).What it's not:It's not NBA jam. You don't have an immersive gametime experience (when they are on the court). The graphics - even in 3d mode - do not compare to playstation etc. The focus of this game is what happens off the court (though you also have a part of the game for calling plays which you need to beat strong teams.)Conclusion:All in all it's a great game. I'm super-satisfied with my purchase. Right now it's 40% off so if you love the NBA and sims you should grab it. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a terrible game. As a veteran of sports management games such as OOTP, Football Manager and others, I was looking for a basketball management game where I could act as coach/gm. Handle trades, draft, free agents, call plays and make subs and tweaks from the sideline.....sports management game. Well, this is the most amateurish game I have ever seen for sale (not free). The interface is terrible, navigation terrible, and whoever translated this game into enlgish did a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor job. The trades and free agent portion is rudimentary at best, the salary structure uses the right terms, but its all wrong in so many ways you just have to see it to know. The game interface is ridiculous. Basically the only thing you really control is subs. Sure you can call plays and make plays but it isnt how you think. You dont call pick n pop or iso and the players look for oportunities based on this play. You call a guy to do a certain thing, then the a/i does only that thing. There is no intuitive reacting or taking advantage of blown defense. If you call for kobe to drive the lane, that is the only thing the computer will do, kobe drive the lane. Kobe triple teamed? oh well, you called for him to drive the lane. shot missed. When you click for a called time out, the wistle doesnt blow next time you have possesion, it may not blow for 2 minutes. I could go on and on, this game is nothing more than a school project, one that deserves a C- on the amateur scale. If I had the chance to start over and the game was only 2$, I would not buy it.

												First of all, you can change the player names with the editor if it bugs you.The management section is better than expected - don't expect Football Manager-type freedom, only the basic things, but they work.Lots of playable countries, championships, cups.Worth a look when it's on sale.

												I would love a refund for this game and it's brother (Front Page Sports Football).  While the football game atleast works (most of the time)  This game routinely crashes to the desktop whenever I try to play a game.  I can simulate a game but whenever I attempt to play I get ""BPM2015 not responding"", constant looping and I have to eventually close the program.  Steam should take a long hard look in regards to allowing these two games to exist on their site given all the similar feedback..			",10,0,1,0,3,1,13

												This game is very much overpriced in terms of its current gameplay.  This should have been labeled as an Early Access game since it is still lack a lot of things. There were some updates done but still, the gameplay and realism of this game sucks plus there's no Steam workshop for it. Definitely a total bummer. With its current price, there are totally a lot of better games you could buy other than this one. I'm sorry but honestly, this is a waste of money and time.			",99,66,2,18,11,3,15

												This game has the framework for possibly being a good game, but at the moment it is not worth anything. It seems to be written by someone for whom English is a second language. I used the ""US Universities"" universe, and the ratings for current collegiate players seem to be entirely arbitrary. The in-game action is not intuitive at all, and the scheduling is all wrong. I immediately regret paying money for this game.			",0,0,0,0,3,0,1

												Such a pretty nice game for the basketball fans. The 3D is a great improvement, as well as the differents tactic options. My single complain is about the players' names (FAKES !!!).			",0,0,0,0,1,0,0
