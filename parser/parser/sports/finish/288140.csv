												Now that the game is fully released i can give a full reviewGraphics - 6/10 by modern standards the graphics are quite poor, they chose to use directX 9 along with unity, The Graphics look ok at first but when you look closer you realise how basic they are.  Water looks terrible, no 3d grass for light rough and rough, lighting is very basic and the performance is inconsistant from course to course. I have to turn settings down on an I7 4790k@4.6ghz and a amd Fury to maintain 60fps on some courses.Gameplay - 7/10 RTS is broken, it is way too sensitive, move the mouse back 2 pixels and thats a full back swing at 800dpi* on a 1080p screen, only increasing the screen to 1440p and the mouse DPI down to 400 is the RTS some what controlable,this is using the lowest sensitivity setting in game....Even then there is no feel and putting is a joke, with the ball rocketing off the face after the smallest slowest movement you can possibly do with a mouse, to top this the game gives zero feedback whilst on the course has to what you are doing right or wrong, the only way to get feedback is to go to the practice area (no putting green btw), and you will get feedback through a launch monitor,  not that it will be any use to you as there is zero explination of what the numbers mean, so if you have never been on launch monitor in real life and had the number explained to you, you are screwed basically. This wasn't thought through at all and they listened to totally the wrong people when implementing this.*Mice used Roccat Kone XTD and Corsair Vengence M65However mouse swing using the meter isn't bad at all,  although it will be very difficult for the beginner. so max assists is recommended..Presention - 6/10 simple menus very easy to navigate....nothing to write home about Value - 5/10 Thought long and hard about this, if the game was £14.99 i would say yes the game is good value for what you get, but they have released it at £26.99...and on top of that have release an extra course as day one DLC (if you have DLC ready for day one, it should be in the game at no extra cost) and are planning more micro transactions.  So id say this game isn't good value, as of now there is no career or progression system, there is a planned course designer, but has yet to materialise (no idea what its going to be like)...there is online play, and solo rounds, for a golf enthusiast maybe just enough, but for a gamer looking for something to play, £26.99 is going to be poor value.Overall 5/10 This game offers nothing for the causual/gamer player, the learning curve is very steep, with zero understandable feedback from the game ( A launch monitor is jibberish to the none enthusiast Golfer, even to some Serious golfers), The gameplay is kind of there, you just have to put is stupid amounts of hours to find it, and you will have to go on the forums to find out what the numbers on launch monitor mean....I do like parts of this game, but i can not recommend it (not at £26.99), so its a thumbs down from me.Edit... I was banned from the forums for critizing thier micro transactions implementation in this game, the game is on its way to pay to win, with being able to buy balls and clubs that change the way the game plays.....Avoid this game and do not support this GREEDY developer.Edit... I just found out that this developer is going to make you pay for ""major"" updates to the game, disguising them as DLC....So this means if you want to keep your game upto date you are going to have to keep sheling out your hard earned cash to do so, and this is after they have the nerve to charge £26.99 for a half finished game.....Edit... This is a quote from the Dev reguarding the future of the game""Once additional Feature driven DLC is available access to play user created content will be limited to those players who are on the new version."" This means courses you create yourself you will not be able to play anymore once the DLC update is released unless you buy it....This is disgusting from the dev its not enough that you have already paid for the game, they just want to fleece you out of more money.....Devs if you read this, its not the peoples who bought this games fault you underestemated how much this game would cost to develop and its not right to ask them to pay extra for updates, no matter how substantial the update is, The way good developers work is once you buy a licence for a game or piece of software it entitles you to updates for life, unless specifically stated...This was not the case with this game, you waited until we had paid our money, and then unleased the news that we would have to pay money for ""milestone"" updates....Sorry but this is morally repugnant on your part, and you have shown that you are just going to milk this community for a long time to come...i really hope more people see through you.Shame really because your game isn't bad, and if you had used directx11 from the start (oh one of things they want to charge for is porting the game to DX12)  and polished the game a little more before releasing it, the game would have sold well and you wouldn't have had to resort to such shaddy practices.

												The entire Bug Reporting section of the Perfect Parallel forums, is not even available to the public. A user must register in order to view the Bug Reporting section of the Perfect Parallel forums. Here, try to find it, otherwise: http://www.perfectparallel.com/forum/26-perfect-golf-bug-reporting/ Instead of taking bug reports seriously, the developers have religiously deleted legitimate forum posts, and fabricated TOS violations out of whole cloth... in an obvious attempt to muzzle legitimate criticisms.When a developer starts deleting on-topic forum posts, devoid of any rules violations, whatsoever... than, they have reached a new low. The developer has now fully retaliated against these criticisms... by issuing a permanent forum ban; as of December, 19, 2015.Only, that's not the good part. The good part; is that, the developer actually dredged up a forum post from May, 2015... as a pretext for a permanent forum ban, that has now been issued over 6 months later! So, basically... Necroban. Here's the screenshot to prove the surreptitious hilarity. If you'll notice, there isn't even anything listed under the all important, ""Ban Reason."" http://s19.postimg.org/3tdzlgav7/2015_12_19_pg_forum_ban.pngThe fact that, a game developer, would actually peruse back over 6 months into a user's post history, as a pretext, to ban them from the forums - and still not be able to come up with a legitimate reason - is both sad, and pathetic... on so many levels. (The ban has since been revoked)Forget about the game. One would reasonably expect more professional behavior from the developers.Nevertheless, here are the rest of the issues with this game:While there are multiple control methods; the controls – particularly when attempting to navigate through the menus and the settings - are both clunky and frustrating.There exists no tutorial, despite the entire piece of software being anything but user-friendly.While there does exist an official Practice Facility, the player is not able to move around, nor follow any shot within said facility; nor can the player putt in the practice facility.The sound is somewhat intermittent, with the impact of golf shots oftentimes being completely missed.The graphics are not entirely terrible, if one is able to use their own imagination... with several obvious gaffes, relating to blending, or the lack thereof; as well as, poor water reflections, and nonexistent edge refraction.For example, the outline of the rough - that separates different types of rough - often bulges, and causes shots hit there to bump squarely up against the outline of the rough, as if the golf ball were coming in contact with a street curb, as opposed to - thick grass.Another example; is that the cart paths hover above the ground. The developer has stated this is intended, as it is apparently a workaround to another issue. – Okay.Another huge issue is the lack of smooth undulating surfaces, particularly on greens. There are jagged creases and geometric shapes with straight lines protruding from the ground; oftentimes causing the golf ball to veer off of its intended path, unnaturally.The latest golfer avatar looks horrendous. The setup positions are largely incorrect, down to the backwards hand positioning. Also, the swing animation has a terrible hitch in it. – It's all just very amateurish in appearance.There is no user customization, whatsoever. Each and every user is required to use the exact same character. The only variation being, some pewter-like shirt color adjustments.The developers have repeatedly made unproven claims about the accuracy of their physics engine, as it relates to actual Tour Golf... despite the actual in-game physics being routinely over-corrected, with each subsequent new draft version of this game.Hitting three-quarter shots makes the ball roll forward excessively, moreso than would be realistically attainable with any given club.In this game; shorter, more-lofted clubs, will oftentimes actually incur more roll-out, than longer, less-lofted clubs... when struck in the same exact manner. Go figure that one out.Or, shots struck with more power, right on the sweet spot, will oftentimes inexplicably lose distance... regardless of the trajectory of the shot.Occasionally, the golf ball will actually penetrate underneath the surface of the turf, warp underground, and pop back up above the surface. This is completely inexplicable, and destroys all immersion.There have been ongoing issues with ball markers; not showing up, nor being in their correct location.There have been ongoing issues with Gimmes; freezing the game progression entirely... when hitting a par 3 tee shot that lands inside Gimme range.The Concede Hole button oftentimes causes the wrong player or team to win the hole.There have been ongoing issues with multiplayer connectivity failing.There have been ongoing connection issues, which may cause undue stuttering while spectating shots.There are ongoing issues with lag, and unexplained disconnections.The Course Creator has yet to be released. However, some beta testers have managed to create courses. The issue is that the system is entirely disorganized, causing users to have to download each course from varying download services, and manually extract each file individually into the correct game directory. There are also no Auto-Updates in place, which also can cause users to have different versions of courses. Yet, there are also false positives, that prevent users from joining games, when the two users in question actually do have the same course version.The lobby itself, is setup rather haphazardly, with inaccurate and incomplete references to player locations.The game is constantly being pirated, and the developers cannot seem to figure out how to kick multiples of obviously hijacked Steam accounts, from the lobby. Chat boxes oftentimes fail, rendering in-game communication inoperable. Also, Multiplayer games are not automatically setup for Voice Chat. Players have to either setup Steam Voice Chat, on their own; or use utilize an outside Voice Chat service.There is no Shot-Clock to dictate a fair pace of play, which is part of the official rules of golf. Since there is no Simultaneous play option in this software... the lack of a Shot-Clock becomes a big deal, as multiplayer stroke games tend to run quite long; or at least, much longer than they conceivably should.It is not possible to convert a grouping to Custom difficulty settings. The difficulty settings chosen must fall under a default difficulty level. The alternative is to allow “Any” difficulty level to join the game; which creates obvious mismatches.The putter head is not at any time squared up at address. Not only that, but the putting itself seems to impart far more break than would realistically occur on similar greens, in real life. One of the most egregious issues, is the lack of Competitive Purpose, anywhere in the game. There is no Career Mode. There is no Official Tour. There are no Rated Multiplayer Games. There are no Win/Loss Records. There are no Experience Points. There aren't even any In-Game Statistics, nor any track-able Player Averages.While anyone can play or join Multiplayer games with and against other users; there is presently nothing whatsoever to play for.“Perfect Golf,” is like a less polished version of the Tiger Woods Golf series. A Poor Man's Tiger Woods Golf, if you will. It originally showed some promise. But, as of yet, there are too many game-breaking bugs, ongoing... as well as, occasional physics anomalies, and the glaring lack of any Competitive Purpose, whatsoever; which would compel any fair-minded individual to - in its current state - give it a thumbs down.

Product received for free
												I got this game for free as a birthday gift because I have been a fan of games like Mario Golf Toadstool Tour. It was a fantastic game in the pre-release and the core gameplay still stands. However, as soon as the end product was released the name ""Perfect Golf"" was changed to ""Jack Nicklaus Perfect Golf"" and micro transactions were added. This seems to range from little things like shirts and pants for your character to golf courses. The prices for this adds up to $250 a year for a season pass?This game was originally $19.99 before release and now stands at $34.99. I was thinking $20 was too much... this is abysmal. A game developer cannot simply add a $250 microtransactions to a game (PER YEAR?!?) and price the game as $34.99. This is unacceptable. Total cash grab. I cannot believe my eyes.If this game were to get rid of it's microtransactions and put the price down to about $15 I would recommend it. However, as the current price stands, it is simply not worth the money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not a chance...The game it self is quite good but it's more aimed to the ""Arcade"" fans but tries to pass it'self off as a game for the Sim golfers..Then they have gone and released it and the 1st thing they do is to add DLC's..So all the ""licenced"" courses will have to be paid for.. on top of the money you have paid for the game..Money grabbing♥♥♥♥♥♥bags!!!!PS.. You even have to BUY golf balls if you want better than bog standard.. and no. not in game cash.. $1 for the golf balls.. GTFO..So the 1 course you get that has a license.. Over $4 / £3... For 1 course ????No. No. No.Do the whole gaming industry a huge favour.. Boycott this money grabbing game and buy ""The Golf Club""The Golf Club in general is a far far far better game and has the best non paid commontator around.. (I think it's one of the devs and he is SOOOOO sarcastic at time.. You get +3 and he'll say some funny comment, make you laugh and you move on to the next..This is the poor mans version of The Golf Club.. so suck it up and go get that one instead.

Early Access Review
								Much like real golf, the things that are the most unrelated to golf are what cause the most frustrations.Happy to change my review later, but as of now the Alphaness of this game is just too frustrating to deal with. I mean, this is golf ... a game who's purpose and intent is to fill one's time with it's own inherent frustrations as a way of rejuvenating one's soul from the frustrations of day-to-day life. If I am frustrated in this game, it should be because the greens are fast and it's especially windy that day, not because my swing suddenly develops some kind of Charles Barkleyesque series of pauses and stutters for some unpredictable reason. That would be a sign that I should see a neurologist. Clean up the bugs and make this game run snappy and I'll be back, otherwise, I've paid for your dinner at the Olive Garden, enjoy.

												Rediculous! You want me to pay 150 bucks for a season pass? WTF? There is absolutely no depth to this golf game. No real way to judge the apropriate striking power for a good shot and the controls overall are just ""thick"" and ""clunky"". So disappointed, there is not even a career mode and no skill tree to follow or upgrade your golfer. No options to obtain newer better clubs or clothing, no sponserships, no, no, no, no!!!!!!!   NO!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								Seriously guys,  I don't mean to be harsh,  but it's been along time since the launch of this gof game  and the game looks nothing like the original videos and screenshots that you presented us with before the game was released!I remember viewing a spectacular video of a mountain course with a beautiful waterfall and stream and to be honest with you,  the graphics in those videos are on par with 'The Golf Club',  but 'Perfect Golf' doesn't look anything like the videos or screenshots that Parellel Perfect portrayed their game to be, even when you look at the three screenshots on their homepage the graphics are not as good in the game!I am running the game on a 4k monitor at 3840x2160 using a Nvidia GTX 970 4GB OC and a i7 4970k @ 4.6Ghz with all the settings on high,  with the exception of changing the amount of trees in distance and detail.I was an old Links LS fan who played the golf sim from the very beginning when the first version of Microsoft Links was released rouglhy 20 years ago,   and Mike Jones who is one of the founding owners of Perfect Parellel use to design and sell the best DLC courses for Links LS,  and incidentally I owned everyone of Mike's courses.When I first came across the previews for 'Perfect Golf' and saw the screenshots,   I knew straight away it was Mike's work,  and I sent an email to him asking him about this new project.  I was extremely excited when Mike told me they were developing a new golf Sim for the PC similar to LinksLS,  and I was even more excited after viewing the screenshots on their website, as well as the amazing flyby video of a mountain course, and the actual hole had this amazing looking stream and waterfall, and the green sat on a small island! However, so far I am personally very dissapointed with Perfect Golf,  and it's not just the visuals,  but the way the game plays as a simulation!I'm sorry Mike,  even though it's still in developement,  it has taken far too long to produce a golf sim that's on par with 'The Golf Club',  and the reason my review is so harsh even though the game is still in development,  is simply because before the game was released,  the work in progress looked amazing, just like the screenshots and videos that are currently on your website.   If this work had already been developed,  how come the initial release didn't look as good as the pre developed work!Personally I think it's deceitful and dishonest to place work in progress shots that look amazing on your website and on the Greenlight section of Steam to gather as many followers and potential buyers for the game,   and when you finally release the game,  it looks nothing like the preview screenshots and videos!  The performance of the game is fine,  but really, it looks and plays like a cheap game, and yes I'm aware that it's still in development,  but as I said,  the work in progress should've been implemented into the game by now!The other important fact  is that eventually they will charge for additional courses and the course designer (Architect Application)!   Most people won't pay for additional courses,  when you have golf games like 'The Golf Club' that comes with the Greg Norman course designer and all courses a absolutely free!However,  if the Jones's can make Perfect Golf look amazingly perfect,  hardcore golf Simmers like myself will pay for quality, especially if the courses are designed by Mike!Perfect Golf should be perfect by now,  but it is far from being perfect!If you guys at Perfect Parellel want to dominate the Golf Sim market,  you need to deliver what you originally presented ASAP,  before the interest dies off.I won't give up on Mike and his team at Perfect Parellel,   simply because I know they have the potential to make the best Golf Sim on the market!  I will continue to check on the progress of  Perfect Golf from time to time to see if it does deliver what it was set out to in the first place!Hopefully one day,  the visuals and the game play I saw on  Perfect Parallel's website will be implemented into 'Perfect Golf',  and it may very well become the perfect golf Simulator!

Product received for free
												Jack Nicklaus Perfect Golf features, to borrow words from one of their devs/fanboys, quite possibly the worst communicated season/annual pass and microtransaction systems that I've ever seen.Not once on any store front or this very page on Steam is it explained that the season pass is NOT for the majority of Steam gamers even though this is very clearly a Steam game. Players who enjoy the game and would consider the season pass on the basis that they want the next twelve months worth of content (an annual basis) are left to make the decision to pump $200-ish into the game without any knowledge that they wont get any benefit from it.Steam users have become accustomed to purchasing season passes to their games that are detailed and communicated professionally to the point that that they know what they are going to receive for their money before purchase. They are not thrown into the deep end and face a high priced annual pass that they have little to no way of knowing what they are getting let alone whether the investment is the right one for them -- which it really isn't going to be for a significant percentage of your Steam player base. For those that do fit the bill, you're right, it is a bit of a bargain (ELI5 - other golfing simulation software that serves a very niche audience are generally priced in the vicinity of $1000+ and occasionally upwards of five times that so in effect the devs have made the market much more accessible). Although I have had positive communication with ONE member of your team the others that have contacted me along with your fanboys have been quite aggressive. This aggressiveness has reached the point of almost being considered criminally abusive. I have personally elected not to respond in kind. In fact, I argue that silence in this instance is the appropriate response. PERFECT PARALLEL, Your game may be one of the most playable golf sims on the market but your behavior and inexcusably woeful communication abilities are the overriding reason why the game suffers such a mediocre review score on Steam. Perhaps if you improved your communication skills your player base would have a much better idea - anything is better than none - of what they are actually criticizing you for. There's a reason why all but one of the most 'helpful' reviews of your game on the front page, as of writing, are thumbs down.			",2243,882,89,270,267,28,370

Early Access Review
								I've played golf for over 25 years. Also, I've been playing the best golf-sim till now, the RTS swing in Links 2003. I thought it would be impossible to better that. Other games, like Tiger Woods, WGT or The Golf Club have lot's of glitch 'n glossy of course, but they don't have that 1 definitive thing: a true golf swing. It's just not there. And that is what a lot of people have been waiting for: the true dynamics that go with immerging yourself in a virtual golfing environment. Swing plane, swing tempo, clubface angles, it's all there. And more. Much more.But it's here now! For the very first time, we now have 'The Motion Swing' in Perfect Golf. A true masterpiece of computer engineering. After spending a couple of hours on the driving range in PG, I've started mastering this great simulation. Everything is there, albeit in embryonic phase, not polished and glitchy yet, but it's there! AND it works beautifully. For every golfer out there, real or otherwise, Perfect Golf is going to be your game, I garantee it.Once you get past The Motion Swing (3-click is also on board for the diehards) you'll discover courses and other options to keep you happy for ever. Not right now of course, the game is being build as I write this, but in the coming months PG is going to become the new standard in simulation golf. One reason for this, is because it has a man on board who has been at the forefront of golfcourse design: Mr Mike Jones. A one time golfpro himself, he started dabbling in PC golf years ago, and ultimately became a major force is this departement. It helps if you KNOW what the game is all about.A sublime golf swing, real weather simulation, all kinds of gameplay, on- and offline, courses come to life with moving objects like trees, water etc, Perfect Golf is going to be everything golfing adepts have been waiting for. All we now have to do is wait for it's completion.			",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

												If I was given a demo vs ea and I had to say weather I would buy it or not, I would have to say no. Here are just a few reasons why;Graphics are sub standard, washed out, no real definition, like someone else said ""Links 2003 looks better"" Which brings me to atmosphere, it just doesn't feel like I just steped out one a 18 hole course. No career mode. I think that speaks for it's self. What sports game comes with no career?Game mechinics; while it seems to work ok in mouse mode, the controler is at best week. example, push left anolog stick once you get a stick one the course you can use for directions, push it again and you are able to see on the little map the distance and direction to the pin, sounds great till you have to move the curser from 3 holes over just to get it back to the hole your on. And it must be done everyhole or your shoting blind.Must reset my controler everytime I play. (really?)All in all combersome game play, substandard graphics, no career, and now DLC for the courses we asked for in the first place(making it appear as a money suck) As it is right now I say no and I am very diapointed in the final product and would not recomend			",116,17,33,26,61,3,32

												What is it with golf games on the PC these days? The PC used to be the home of golf games, these days the available library of golf games on PC are a joke.The problem with this game is the same as the problem with ""the other"" one (The Golf Club), the swing mechanics are inconsistent. Golf is a game of consistency and finesse, especially on the green. The control system in this game doesn't allow for either of those things. Having said that, I'm referring to the motion swing mechanics as I'm not a fan of the 3 click method.If you really want a good golf game on PC and you're not too fussed about graphics, Links 2003 is still available and is pretty much the only worthwhile golf game on the platform right now. Don't waste your money on this, it would be better spent on an actual round of golf.			",94,3,5,12,23,1,21

												Not a terrible golf game, but there`s a number issues that prevent me from recommending it. 1. No career mode. Unforgiveable IMO. Without it the game gets OLD very fast.2. Even with it`s simplistic graphics the game is a resource hog due to it`s terribly optimized game engine.3.Overpriced add on courses.4.Sterile, boring game environment with very little ambient sounds.5.Bugs galore. On Windows 10 it can be annoying, but if you`re using Linux don`t even bother  it`s virtually unplayable.6. A developer who begs people on their forums to post positive reviews on Steam because of all the negative reviews it`s been getting instead of just fixing the game.			",91,8,0,23,12,0,12

												Warning!Wow, with all the years and development since Links and Tiger Woods, I expected a visually stunning game. This game is destined for the bargain bin. I feel sorry for Jack Nicklaus that his name is attached. Putting model is diabolical (multiple instances of the ball stopping at 0 inches from hole from a short putt) No appreciable interaction with the course (trees are no obstacle) Player animation is from the original Links 98 (not fair Links 98 was better)SAVE your money, do not purchase!

												Have played golf games for years. Played the Jack Nicklaus golf game years back and made some custom stuff for it. I got excited when I saw this game and bought it right away. It has to be the most confusing game I've ever purchased and I'm very good with computers and played many different types of games for years. While I understand this is an indie game, there has to be SOME documenation or direction on how to play. I couldn't get a golfer to actually make one shot. The meter goes as I click it, but the golfer doesn't do anything. Tried moving my mouse around..nothing. Also can't figure out how to add a computer golfer to play a round. A lot more thought and effort needs to put into the helping the consumer know how to use their product. It's too bad as visually it looks ok.The only thing I know how to do this game is request a refund. I would avoid this product if your are looking for a game you can just pick up and have a nice game of golf.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												No way is it worth the price, even if you buy from elsewhere rather than steam. Still a bit buggy. Playable, fun for a while, but the ruination and damning thing is they want micro-transactions. Haven't seen this since the TW Masters Online fiasco a few years back from EA. Why can't we buy cool new gear/clothes  when we level up from hard earned in-game winnings like all decent golf games ?All the Tiger Woods games apart from the Masters are just as good, more polished and are more fun than this. Glad i got into this way back in Alpha as i would never buy such a lame duck.If you want to buy when no other golf is available, go ahead during a sale. You will enjoy it for a time, but bigger better golf is on the horizon...			",100,8,13,8,3,0,1

								Lack of instruction..Meter jerky.Needing to adjust graphics per course.,I see the participation has dropped quickly.course forge? why are the elitist folks getting such a head start in course creation.clearly courses are being made. why is this being held back?now you can cheat in this game?some of the certainties in the life of this game... a private beta tester will take every chance given to let the lobby and forums know their special testers.unless of course when it comes to taking blame for all the mistakes that get poassed them,the time one sits in the game lobby counts as time played in the game total.. I see many folks sit and do nothing as they sleep in the game lobby piling up hours of noted game time as if it means anything.course forge is being used to create mostly playable courses. yet it's not ready for release to the public?talk about getting left behind in early access.still no course forge? April of 2016.  It's that time of year when golf season starts and the dev's will be busy doing other things rather than fix the bugs.I see the developer of this game is friends with known cheater ""crusher"" .. seems about right.goes to show the integrity of this game.

												Update: Even with a new machine and renewed attitude, this game still sucks a big pair of Golden Bear nuts.This game is so realistic, it will make you rather play the real thing than stumble through this confusing ""reality"" rich pre-pre-alpha.I've tried to give this game several chances, but upon playing the latest build of the game I give up, for now.I'll probably be back after a few updates, but to the average or casual gamer, this is not the game you're looking for.Inexplicable crashes, buggy graphics, and only ONE character model (which is hideously ugly) make this feel like a rushed, empty shell of a game waiting for content. A visit to the poorly designed and buggy developer website only made me feel like this game doesn't have a future.Micro-transactions seem to be the ultimate goal here with their confusing ""Season Pass"" and one ball that you can buy. I'm not spending anymore money to think I'm helping make an unplayable game more playable. I've experimented with all swing styles presented in the game, and again, without taking the time to suffer through the learning curve (putting is the worst) you will never feel you've gotten anything out of this game.This is more of a ""reality golf simulator"" than a golf video game. The reason successful sports games become successful is they often find engaging ways to make the player feel they are doing better, or making an impossible shot possible.I'm sure someone will get on me that ""THIS GAME ISN'T FINISHED"" and to give it a chance later (which I will) this is more of a shining example of reasons we as a community should stop this wave of pre-alpha games from mudding up and getting mixed in with finished games. Since when did unfinished products get a green light to be rushed to consumers? Basically you are paying to test an un-fun real life golf simulation. I'd rather just go play golf, it has fresh air, exercise and sexy beer cart girls.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Too long in development, things promised never delivered, an awful UI, and overall not very well developed from the top down.Developers seem more concerned with releasing pay-for courses than they are in creating a quality game.Honestly, I'd recommend Links 2003, a game that is 15 years-old, over PG, which tried to emulate Links but has so far failed miserably.

												TL;DR Gameplay is pretty fun, but the potential for lots of micro-transactions (new maps) may ruin the game for some.PROS- Gameplay is fun- Controls are pretty goodCONS- Microtransations- Feels overpriced- Graphics are fairly poor by today's standardsThe game itself plays pretty nicely. At $20 during early access, I would say it was worth it. But at $35, plus microtransations - no. Time to move on and wait for a proper golf game on the PC.			",126,14,4,18,25,2,7

								Not recommended. They need to fix the swing, either it is motion swing or power meter.  The motion swing should be the best simulation for golf swing as you can control the speed or power with your mouse just like real golfing. At present, only the power meter is working for the long shot, but not those chipping or sand. Way out of control for close range, If you expect this game to be similar to title likes tigerwoods or PGA gameplay, you will be in for disappointment. I should have wait for the ""Real"" perfect golf.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								At this point in development, 1/27/15 the game is lacking in the control department.  If you are coming from Tiger Woods series or Golf Club you will have a steep learning curve.  You can get the hang of it but why try so hard when there other options to play.. to be honest I rage quit (while trying the motion swing) this game and went back to Tiger Woods 08.. The only reasonable control scheme at the moment is the 3 click in this game.. The graphics are ok.. I assume they will get better, overall I'd rate this game a 5 out of 10 until further development fixes problems and the odd nuances.			",76,6,4,9,10,3,3

Surely if I can run Call of Duty Advanced Warfare or Bioshock Infinite at at LEAST medium settings at 30 fps I should be able to run a GOLF game.

Posted: May 8, 2016
												I wish I could recommend the game overall - I'm very conflicted about it.The graphics are so old and basic looking - Looks ok from a distance, but when you're playing it's very poor.The actual golf game play is probably the best of all options right now if you focus solely on the swing options, physics, ball spin, wind impacts and so forth.  Also, a multiplayer lobby and a multitude of game modes are great to see, but sadly no career mode or ""pro mode"" or anything like that.But there also are endless strange bugs and interface weirdness, especially using a controller (which is the newest way to play, so hopefully that gets worked on more).The main hangup is the old looking graphics.  The game has no grass, really basic looking water, trees with an odd sort of sheen look to them (something weird about how they look especially in the distance) and overall just appears to my gaming eyes like something you might have thought ""looked great"" in the early to mid 2000's.  Now I'm used to such a higher bar of quality in most every other game, genre and platform, that it is really hard to look at and enjoy for me.  It's all just flat textures draped all over for the most part.  Thumbs down on that for sure.I guess if you can get past the really old looking graphics, it's a great game of golf. But for me I can not do a ""recommend"" on it with graphics this behind the times.  Being on a golf course involves natural beauty and graphics quality is a main part of this type of games' appeal to me....and perfect golf lacks in this area big time.			",0,0,0,0,1,1,0

												Edit: The more I am playing this, the less I am liking it. Too many bugs to ignore. At the price point and state of the game, just wait to see if things improve. As I said, I will take the gamble and not ask for a refund.TL;DR: This game has potential. It is challenging and fun. I will give this game a chance and wait for more patches. Buy if you are willing to put up with some bugs and sometimes wonky gameplay. Otherwise, wait.I have been waiting for ""that"" golf game on PC. That one golf game that hits the sweet spot. I am sad to report this game does not reach that goal in my opinion. I'll start with the positives:+ I like the joypad support+ Graphics are not bad. Not eye-popping, but decent+ Lots of course options+ Decent amount of courses to start with+ Challenging gameplay when I leave handholding features offWith those, that makes this game have a lot of potential. I want to love it, but meh...- Physics can be wonky and odd at times.- Graphical bugs that are quite annoyingNow it is not the negatives that make me feel this game falls flat and not have that smile factor I have been waiting for. It's the ""neutrals"":- Overall feeling feels very sterile. Perhaps this is not a negative, but it feels like being that guy told to go to the other part of the course by himself.- Lack of commentary. Again, not necessarily a negative, but is a nice distraction. Crowd sounds would have been nice. That's because I am a neckbearded basement dweller and need that validation.			",116,23,3,27,23,1,24

Also bear in mind once you have bought the game you will have to pay for added content at some point.its so sad sorry PP cant recommed this game anymore.Jack Nicklaus perfect golf hmmmm New name new sponsor still the same glitchy unoptimized pile of rubbish and now you are going to have to pay for official courses to and its not going to be cheap.

								Since the death of Tiger Woods Online we've been yearning for a replacement. Perfect Golf suddenly appeared on the horizon promising unrivalled visauals and gameplay. After ages in development we finally have a playable version. Anyone hoping for a Tiger replacement are going to be very upset. One word sums this mess up, tragic! It is truely aweful, gloomy dark looking visuals, golf ball looks like a grey blob, no ball textures at all, no background sounds, confusing club selection, no tab to as we're all used to, it's a mess. I realise it's early access but is this some kind of joke? It looks like it's been in developement for a couple of days, let alone years! The bones are there but that's about it, the devs need to seriously look at the future of this, forget the glorious youtube vids, it looks nothing like that, back to the drawing board or give it up, it's that bad!

Early Access Review
								UPDATED 2-20-16 To potential buyers, be warned that the developrs have askd for poeple to post reviews. So the flood of recent reviews stem from that request.Even with the latest updates this game still has a long way too go. The RTS mouse swing isn't as good as PGA2k, TW series or CPG/WGC. It just has no feel, you have no idea what went wrong when the swing motion that just worked fine now sends your shot shanked off into the woods or a hazard. Ball physics are still unrealistic. This game is more frustrating to play than real golf a lot of the time.  I would love to say yeah buy it. But if you do just know there is still a ways to go yet.Recommend this game? yes with a caveat. It is FAR from ""Perfect"" Golf. ball physics are terrible, putting is unrealistic, motion swing isn't real-time or tied to the golfer, wind has no effect, multiplayer has issues. Graphics are good (not as good as The Golf Club, better than World Golf Challenge 2011, the other 2 golf games I play).The other caveat is to play this (and most new games) you'll need CPU and video card horsepower to run  it at high graphic settings. Basically this is Links 2003 updated to a 2009-ish game. If you like Links 2003 you'll really like PG. For those of us who like a golf game with a real-time mouse swing buy this early access release and see if the improvements over time make it better. $20 isn't a deal breaker. Right now I've stopped playing it and will try it again in a month or so to see if any improvements have been made.UPDATE 8-13-16many patches later this game still has issues. Latest patch introduces some ""anti-cheat"" into the software. So if you make a number of good swings the game says ""must be cheating, using some outside swing aid on the mouse"" and then will cause a mis-hit resulting in an errant shot. So you get penalized for honing a swing?!?Ball physics still not realistic. Lob Wedge  shot lands, kicks forward?? no back spin? Yet out of the rough or sand ball checks up and spins back.They really need to bring back the original programmers who initially did the game so the code that keeps getting broken with every patch can be fixed. but given so many have now worked on the code, it's probably really messed up for good and needs a complete rewrite.So still can't recommend this game, just be aware of all the faults if you do decide to buy			",8,0,0,0,5,2,1

												1-4-17: Overall rating is mixed with only 64% positive, last rating 65% 1 before 66%, 1 before that 68% as this game continues to plummet.The continued ignorance of the detestible Mike Jones and the total mis-management of this game are making it a shambles, as more and more haters pile-on to it with bad, bad reviews every week!Mike Jones had no right and no reason to delete my entire profile - he just didn't like it, and what is the -100 all about on my reputation score when it was at 93, just utterly peevish and child like behavior from Mike Jones.. Mike Jones also had no right and no reason for putting me on mod queue for pointing out St Andrews as it stands is woefully inadequate as the supposed flagship course of the game, I put snapshots of the PP St Andrews up against photographs of exactly the same scenes and it is hugely obvious the texturing is nowhere near up to scratch and the bushes/ bramble are either non existent of have been done very very crudely indeed it's either an amateur job or a rush job (compare it to snapshots of Royal troon on their social site to see what is possible when done to a high level of design) - but again he just didn't like it, suddenly I was 'trolling' for saying what most of the top designers must surely have been thinking and instead of getting his honest opinion that I requeasted on St Andrews he immediately sabotaged my account and openly baited me in to writing a negative review on steam, not exactly a team player for the company!***I just want to add here - I actually tried to pursue his disgusting treatment of me to their public relations department giving a full account of what had happened to me and asking them to investigate the whole matter with a 3rd party from within the company - guess what they did? SHUT DOWN MY ENTIRE PROFILE SO IT WAS NON RETRIEVABLE no doubt to get rid of the evidence of sabotage!!! UNBELIEVABLE AND DRACONIAN TREATMENT OF A PAID UP CUSTOMER!!! just to check it was a result of my complaint I created a new temporary profile and resent the request for a 3rd party investigation - account completely shut down again.conclusion: - SO WE KNOW THEY (Perfect Parallel and it's employees, particularly Mike Jones) ARE SCUM, THEY OPERATE LIKE SCUM AND THEY SHOULD BE UNDER INVESTIGATION BY A CONSUMER WATCHDOG!!!!!!! ***But these observations have to be stated and addressed for the good of the game and it's standing in the future because proper course critics who do get commisioned to evaluate courses would laugh our St Andrews out of town - hands down they would it would get savaged in any magazine review for instance!! But that says a lot about Mike himself, the qualities of the man - he's peevish, if I wanted to say it more succinctly - he's a very awkward man with terrible judgement and limited scope - you get them usually as security officers and they have that regrettable nature about them, that's why they stand the gates 11 hours a night I suppose, but not nearly qualified for a position Mike Jones finds himself in. The management of this game is also woefully inadequate and the forum best exemplifies that - they have let 3 or 4 of the most unfortunate people run riot here and spoil it for the rest, and as The Golf Club starts up societies and captures the mass market this one has been left behind in the sticks through poor project planning and will end up nothing more than a backwater of a few gnarly old men who know their life is spent and have nothing better to do than henpeck all day. They are still stuck in a cycle of patching up and re patching up bugs and performance issues when they should really be doing time-cost-perceived benefit analysis, there are many soft-fixes that I can see that would result in a considerable perceived improvement to the game, but as it stands there does not appear to be any kind of project planning utilizing the most effective tools in this regard.In fact I percieve the game after a while away from it as actually being 'MORE BROKE' than it was over a year ago with the constantly disappearing swingmeter in 3 click mode standing out like a sore thumb, I mentioned it several times but got zero response from the team as they only seem to take the word of a few select. One of their very very top level designers I have chatted with has called it 'the clique' and described them as 'in their own world', and it has done absolutely nothing for the furtherment of the game over that time period I mentioned.Badly badly run indeed, I play it, play it a lot but I can't recommend it. Such a shame.			",2,3,0,0,4,0,0

								This game isnt worth $20. The physics are completely unreal and wind plays no factor into any shot. There is also no indicator as to where you are aiming. Theres no indicator on the shot meter as to what is 100%. Part of the bar is red which tells me ""bad"" but I have no way of actually knowing. This game is VERY incomplete. There is potential, but as of right now the devs have a loooong way to go.			",72,5,1,6,6,3,1

												I go back old school -- to Jack Nicklaus Signature Edition from the DOS days (best golf game EVER), right up to Jack Nicklaus 6.I was eager to jump into Jack Nicklaus Perfect Golf and was emmidiatly horrified. This game is on par  graphics-wise with JN6 (released 1998?), and plays less than well. I played 9 holes and promptly refunded my purchase.I recommend Tiger Woods Masters Edition for the best modern representation of golf out there.Avoid Jack Nicklaus Perfect Golf. ",69,1,11,6,12,1,1

												After playing this game for 70 hours or more I can confirm that this game is a complete turd.Do not waste your money on this game.It has been in development for years now but it has not improved one bit at all.This game has failed in every way possible from the shoddy patching and unreal amount of payed dlc addons.I payed $20 for this game in early access and it was the worst $20 ive ever spent on a game.After numerous patches and fixes it will not even run on my pc anymore and it used to.Never felt so ripped off from any purchase on steam ever.Nevermind the fact that the devs banned me from the forums for kindly explaining my issues with the game.The devs do not know how to deal with criticism in a human like manor.Stay far away from this piece of crap do not waste your money on it. Its a complete joke of a game and always will be.The devs making this game have no clue how to properly implement patches that successfully fix anything.It will be a never ending turd for the rest of its life do not buy this nightmare of a game.The price has actually been raised for some unknown reason since the time that I bought it but this game isnt even worth a $1.00.As I said stay far away from this cancer.

								.  I suggest people wait to see if the game has no more cheaters.update.. update bites. try the controller. try to miss. hard to miss. update misses. a simple game from simple minds.  oboy! but we got divots!  I've got AI with a broken arm.  This is what months of testing has produced. crashing to desktop. This is what you get when a cheerleader tests this game. no matter how many mistakes the devs make.. the testers cheer um on!  I'm sure I'm the only one who noticed though with all those great reviews.the complete wussification of this game now that you can choose a controller that hits straight everytime. fanboydom runs rampant as the llollypop guild post positive reviews based on lies used in one sentence words at best. I notice the shine wearing off on this latest update as the flock of players is dwindling each day.a promise of being able to move the swing meter still not worked in any update... but we got to get dem divots in der!the devs are now trying to manipulate negative reviews so that they can not be updated.be aware! this is as low as it gets.If you need any proof.. contact me and I will provide you to a link...

								No club selection, swing % guage,  or backspin. Short shots are a laugh because of the limitations of the swing mechanics. the wind has no effect if you mis-hit; example: the wind is blowing 22 mph east, I am hitting north, I mis-hit to the left (west) by the smallest bit and my ball goes almost 90 degrees west...? Early release my foot. More like ported from the App store. Not much at all to like about this game. You got me with the money grab; nice one!			",44,12,3,6,35,3,11

								The game has huge potential and promise. Granted, the EA version has a few issues upon initial release but they are being caught by the new users and the Devs have a good list of things to work upon. That said, the game is beautifully playable offline and only limited today, by the online connections many games suffer from. It's best to begin offline anyway and play the game as it was made to be, a golf simulation. I wouldn't play a real golf course without learning how to hit a ball..! The graphics on my 4yr old system run fine. I'd love to improve them, but to ensure the game runs with a good frame rate, I opted to keep the graphics down. However, the view is good, I have no tears or glitches and the screenshots I've taken look great. I can play the game at fullscreen in 1920 x 1080, so everything is as I expect. Gameplay is almost spot on. It puts you in total control when playing using the 3 click system. The other control method is still being developed, so I'd expect that area to improve alot over the coming months. I won't comment any more on that, as I've not really tested it. This isn't like older or other golf games, it feels more Sim than Arcade. Granted it has a few elements that are needed to transfer anything simulated to a computer game, but they are minimal and necessary. Real Time Weather is pretty cool, and works a treat. The Time of Day setting is one of my favourite things, being able to visually see the sun rising or setting, and playing a twilight game has the good old feel of those summer evenings, with time on your side.  Currently the 5 courses are just about right. With the promise of many more to come, it will soon become a tough decision choosing what course to entangle yourself within. Plus of course the Course Forge (Designer) a little further down the road.  I'd certainly like to see alot more improvements, walking the hole, first person perspective to name a basic few. However, reading the forums and discussions from the Dev's have made it clear these guys want to deliver something similar too. It feels like a winner to me.			",56,8,1,7,17,1,18

								I bought the game a while back, but it refused to load on Linux. So today  ti updated and lo and behold it loaded. Weird but the grass, trees and verything is grey, it doesn't look right.Next issue, Is it that difficult to have a start screen where you can choose ""single player"" or ""multiplayer""?I have a pretty high spec computer, but this game loads slowly. I think they tried to do too much, like linking my realtime weather with the game's weather, why would you do that?Overall I really was looking forward to playing some relaxing golf. I hit some balls and turned it off. The game lacks something. Not an enjoyable experience.			",12,3,1,5,15,0,14

												I don't care what the beta supporters preach, this game is not worth the amount of money they want. The ""season pass"" bull♥♥♥♥ is RIDICULOUS. The game instantly shows you it's incomplete, poor throughout and basically a cash grab with the membership business and just throwing Jack Nicklaus into the mix to try and save it. Instant return. I've seen and played better golf games a decade old. Don't care if you think I don't play it long enough. I had it set to max settings, running on a beast machine, and it looked like F2P mobile game for an iPad. I'd like to play Torrey Pines please...oh wait. Augusta? Riviera? Pebble?...no?

								Terrible!It's not a golf game, it's a shell of a golf game with no internals. There is no AI, no season/career options, no stats, no tournament play. You can play a round against yourself or an online opponent and that's it! Graphics are average but it does however still require serious PC juice to run. Menus are few because there are no real features that require menus. Visually the menus have a very simplistic layout and are certainly not intuitive to navigate. There are no great new features in Perfect Golf that other golf games don't have. The features it does have are nothing new and are extremely basic with many bugs/issues.You would think the developers would do something great with one of the most important areas of any golf game, the swing meter! Well, no, it's as basic as you can get! I like to click. You have some very basic difficulty settings you can adjust for the game difficulty and that's the end of the swing meter feature list. There is no option to change the swing meter speed to something of your liking. There is no option to add markers to the meter. The meter links to the graphics engine so if you don't have a silky smooth running game, you also won't have a silky smooth meter making it impossible to play. These are simple meter options golf games over a decade old provided. Perfect Golf gives you the most simplistic of meters with virtually no options to tailor it. If you use the mouse method for swing, same deal, extremely basic with little to no control. There is not even a horizontal mouse swing option! There is no feedback on how well you did with your swing as in Tiger Woods games so you never know what area of your swing needs work.Considering how little of a golf sim Perfect Golf provides, you would think the developers would nail what has been done before in golf games and improve upon those features. No such luck! Here we have first time developers and it shows in every bland detail of the game! One final example to leave you with. The game contains a follow the ball in flight option same as a ball-cam from the Tiger Woods games. In Tiger Woods the camera follows the ball through flight and as it hits the ground the camera smoothly follows behind the ball as it bounces and comes to a stop. In Perfect Golf, as the ball hits the ground, the camera bounces along with the ball! The entire screen jumps up and down. Talk about annoying! Talk about motion sickness! Talk about the feeling you are playing arcade golf! You find youself expecting the golf ball to explode or some dude to come out from behind a tree and start shooting at you every time your shot hits the deck!It's an early access game but it's not too difficult to see a game that no amount of time and patching will help ever become a good one. Complete waste of money and time!			",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Specifically, the course designer for PG has been long discussed and was supposed to be in the game on release. 4 months later it's still not there. Beyond the course designer, there still is no career mode. The game still has performance issues. There still is limited character customization, no announcers, very limited stats, poor UI, etc. Essentially almost NONE of the negatives have been fixed even though many of those things have been promised. Thus I can't recommend the game because I don't see tangible progress in improving the product. -----I've been arounds since PG's failed kickstarter. I bought the game as soon as it came out on Early Access. However, that doesn't make me a fan. It makes me a fan of golf games. PG does some things right. It does some things wrong. Because it's a mixed bag, it's easier to list what is good and what's bad about it. As always, YMMV.Pros:- numerous swing type options - there are multiple though I'm a three clicker all the way and very impressed by the smoothness of the meter. The mouse swing is challenging. They've tried to implement no-cheating modes but they broke the mouse swing while doing so.- various levels of challenge - play this with all the aids on and you'll be in birdie city. Play this without them and you might be lucky to break 90. I'm not nearly as good as I once was, but at one point I was in the top 10 on Case's Ladder on Links and #1 on another ladder. So I'm glad it's challenging rather than the ""Shoot 48 at Augusta on Tiger Woods"" mode.- good physics - I'm still not happy with the backspin but generally the physics are good and better than any other golf game. Backspin still is off and I generate more backspin on my short irons (and I shoot in the 90s) than my avatar in this game. Other than that they're spot on. For instance, if you play a course at higher elevation the ball will travel further. That's a nice touch.- weather / time of day settings can add some real challenge to your game. I think the wind feels spot-on.- many different courses to choose from and quite a few to download- multiple modes of gameplay, including solo, multiplayer and tournaments with match play, team play, alt shot, etc.- no micro-transactions that improve your game- no stupid characters that drive the ball 400 yards. Over-driving distance ruins so many golf games and they've prevented that here.Cons:- no career mode built into the game yet- course designer hasn't been released yet (it's now 4 months late and counting)- I don't like the way the skies look and the trees can look a little jagged- limited current player animations (no lefties, no females yet though they're coming)- very,very, very limited character customization- it requires a decent computer and user made courses don't always run well. In fact, the user made courses often exceed the RAM allowance in the game causing major problems from a chunky swing meter to crashing.- slightly too limited shot shaping options. I wish I could position my swing path and feet differently to get inventive when shotmaking. - very limited stats- no announcer and limited sound effects- no Steam Workshop integration (a cardinal sin for a game with downloadable courses)- really poor and frankly butt-ugly user interface when you enter the game (though it's fine when actually playing a round)So it's up to you whether to buy it. I can tell you it's a better game than that ""other"" golf game on Steam and probably the best one available on the market today. But it's by no means perfect yet (pun intended) and while I had hoped that many of the cons would be fixed, this doesn't seem to be happening. The product feels more and more abandoned with a lack of substantial progress since release. If you want a golf game now, this is the one to buy becuase frankly it's probably your only decent choice. Since I'm a fan of the old Links games and golf games in general so I continue to load up PG from time to time. But if you aren't a golf nut, this game isn't for you because it's just too limited in the features and progress to appeal to a wider audience.			",81,36,8,60,54,5,57

												They have a long ways to go with this game. The lower I set the AI's abilities his shots just get better and better. With all ability settings on the lowest value (""1"") he repeatedly drives within feet of the hole. With the greens settings at ""easy"" the undulation of the turf reminds one of the swells on the Bering Sea--with radical pitches and slopes. On some holes you might think you were playing mini-golf because the cup actually sits atop a mound. The AI makes improbable shots from the tee, from the fairways, and on the greens. To be fair the AI shots are sometimes what you would expect at a setting of ""1""--but then there's those ""wow"" shots. Very inconsistent. Also, there is no way to ""save"" your preferred settings from one session to the next. Each play time requires that you re-set everything to your preferences. Also, some graphics are below ""par"" (pardon the pun). I cringe everytime I look at the deformed wrists of the avatars. It looks painful!On the positive side, the scenery is very pleasant.I won't play this game for a month or so. Maybe there will be some significant improvements by then?I will recommend this game based on the chance that the short-comings may get fixed.--------------------------------UPDATE: PC games should be fun even if they are challenging. This game is NOT fun. It is NOT relaxing NOR can it be enjoyed! If you want FRUSTRATION then this is your game. Nothing has improved. The inconsistencies are the only constant. Hit a shot ahead of the ""dead center"" line and watch your ball slice wildly! Your best guess as to how to make your putt will never be correct. The ""easiest"" settings are NOT easy. If you want to be AGGRAVATED buy this game. Do NOT believe the PC Gaming review. If this game is still in development why are they charging $34.95!? I'm terrible at real golf and I have allergies that are exacerbated by grass on the fairways and greens; but still real golf is less frustrating and a lot more fun than this game. At least in real golf I know that everytime I hit the ball it's gonna go right!			",10,0,1,0,12,0,1

												I want to like this game. It is beautiful and it appears to have a good physics engine. But the UI is atrocious and extremely aggravating. It is hard to see how far shots will go, the lay of the green, how to control shots - everything is a pain to figure out. This feels half-baked but there is a great game underneath this horrible, aggravating, good-for-nothing user interface.			",3,0,0,2,1,0,3

								This IS NOT Tiger Woods, and it doesnt promise to be. The lack of controller support makes the game completely unplayable from your couch. This is a golf SIM, not a casual golf game. If you attempt to use your mouse with motion swing, your ball will fly left every time. The graphics are sub-par at best which is unfortunate. If you have played golf games before, this one is VERY easy to pick up and start playing. Very simplistic. I didnt want another Tiger Woods game. I was however, hoping that some of the positives that made those games so much fun would be incorporated in this. Who knows, its early access. I hope the DEVS have everyone in mind while making this game. Not just the die had golfer, but the casual gamer/EA fans as well. Controller support would go a long way in making this game more fun, lets get that done quick. Looking forward to seeing the completed game. ",65,11,4,0,13,2,0

								This game is no where near what was advertised... Photorealistic courses... nope... motion swing controls... so sensitive as to be unusable... three click controls... wow just wow, so sensitive that any little sliver outside the normal results in the ball taking a slice or hook so terrible that the ball travels miles off course... I'm a decent golfer and have been playing golf games since the early 90s. This game is just not worth it at this stage. They have way too much to do to it and I don't know where they got the screen shots and videos from, but the look and feel of the game was straight up terrible... and clunky... that's the term... clunky.

												I have been playing this for a while now . When you get it you have to find the best settings for your system . Graphics level , camera views , etc. You can pick the clubs you want to use . It looks like they may have custom add on clubs and cloths in the future too . You will have to play for a while to see what settings you like for game play . Try out the different difficulty levels and see what you like to swing with . Mouse or click . Lots of different settings to play with .I have downloaded many courses from the website . Users also have courses made and most are free and pretty fun . I downloaded 2 different par 3 courses that are a blast and fun to learn your short game on . This game is fun and well worth it considering all the courses you can get . There are some pay courses too . I will probably try one of those out too . Can it do everything Links386 did , no . Is this game fun , YES . It gets updates and we just got a free new course called Rio .UPDATE Feb 23 , 2017I waited long enough for this game to get fixed . The more they fix bugs and tweek it the worse it gets . The guy developing this doesnt know his♥♥♥♥♥♥from a hole on a green . Why Jack would even allow his name on it is beyond me . This is not a simulator like some might say . Its not even as good as Links 386pro made 20 years ago except for graphics . Options are just not there .  When its not laggy it is fun but when its laggy it really screws up the swing with the 3 click method . Ball flight is not smooth either . This was taken out of beta and does not work properly for everyone . Developer doesnt seem to think there is a problem so I take anything good I said about this game and call it plain crap . One day maybe someone that knows what their doing will create another great game like links 386 with all the options . I gave it a chance . Sorry Snowflake . If you buy this make sure you have a super computer .Update March 14 , 2017Just contacted Jack Nicklaus with an email . Waiting for response as to why he would put his name on this crappy game which was one reason why I bought it . Guess he isnt bankrolling it or it wouldnt be so lousy . Cant wait for an answer .

								I've been looking for a pc golf game to play since it looks like the big studios have abandoned them. Really think I've hit the jackpot here. The game isn't super easy but also it's not so hard you just want to stop playing. I only play 3 click but thank God they didn't try to reinvent the wheel here. Click to start click at 12 and click at 6. As far as I can tell so far the speed doesn't change between difficulties on clicking just the margin of error on the final click at 6. Haven't jumped into a multiplayer game yet but the times I've been on the lobby looks to have a good number of people in it. Just an all around great game.			",1,0,0,2,1,0,0

								Hands down the best golf simulation ever created. Things that seperates itself from other games:-A real time physics engine combined with real ball flight data(launch angles, spin rates and ball speeds) taken from launch monitors put this game in a class of it's own. Once you experience the before mentioned there really is no going back to other golf games.-The Motion Swing mouse mechanic is a first of it's kind that introduces D plane swing theory. What is D plane theory and how does it realate to the mouse? Well, the simplified answer is the tracking of the actual swing path plus the tracking of the clubface angle. Your swing path is determined by the direction you move the mouse and the clubface angle is determined by the tempo at which you move your mouse.-A real time weather and lighting system allow you to input a geographic location and play in those weather and lighting conditions. Never before has a golf game recreated weather and lighting conditions like this game. The lighting and shadow effects are exceptional and really change the look and feel of a course. You can even play in a thunder and lightning storm. Even though you wouldn't do this in real life it's worth doing in PG just to see the lightning effects.-The last thing worth mentioning, and maybe the most important is, this may be the first game to offer up realistic scores in competition. I see no way to shoot in the 50's on a consistent basis, especially with aids turned off. I see scores being very close to real life, maybe even higher. Since tempo plays such a high role in the swing, straight edging or trying to zero out the x axis on the mouse is not going to get your far. Also, since the game uses a real time physics engine to determine spin you can't put artificial spin on the ball and throw darts at every flag.$20 for this game is a steal. Buying it now will save you $10 to $15 when it goes retail. Once the course forge is released with the retail version and courses start pouring in, there will be no reason to even talk about another golf game. The potential this game has is limitless. If done right, this could be one of the greatest sports sims ever created.			",8,1,4,0,4,0,4

								Well 58 hours into this game and I am surprised and delighted with it, an exceptional program for a test release.I was a Tiger Woods player from the very first and enjoyed each version and I have a strong liking to the three click swing meter.I think many who do not like this game are still committed to the unusually low scores attainable in the TW range. Even I had my 15/20 under par rounds at St. Andrews. The swing meter has sever punishment for a pulled or pushed shot, but this only encourages me to take more care on the third click.I have only played the easier settings but the wind seems to have little effect on the flight of the ball.At times the roll seems excessive especially on the fairway slopes.The graphics and ambient surround sound have an exceptional quality.I have experienced two bugs, one irrelevant and the other annoying.(a) : At times the lower half of the players legs disappear in the bunker.(b) : The program freezes after a final putt is made and there is noway to restart the program or PC except to reboot. When the PC is rebooted the game continues from where it froze. This has happened on about six games to date.I am convinced that if this program continues and expands as it has begun it will be an extremely addictive game to play.Anticipating the future.

								I have been playing Tiger Woods '08 PC on a regular basis since it came out back in 2007.  No modern golf game has come close.  That is until PerfectGolf was released.  The graphics are top notch and very realistic.  You can see all of the undulations and slopes on the fairways/greens very clearly unlike some golf games.  The addition of trees and bushes from SpeedTree last year improved the visuals a great deal.  The graphic improvements will no doubt continue in the future with the possible addition of 3D blades of grass using Nvidia’s Turf Effects tool.The newly implemented Real Time Swing for controller and mouse has enhanced the game immeasurably in addition to the availability to download fine user made courses (around 24 available as of the date of this review).  That brings the current number of stock and user made courses up to around 37, a number no other modern golf game can touch.  These course numbers will continue to grow and grow once the CourseForge tool comes out and also once the developers start making licensed courses available.  Online play is great with turn based multiplayer and the ability to tee off with up to 8 players.  You can stop and resume your round at a later time.  There are loads of different play modes available in PerfectGolf.  If tournaments are your thing you can participate in many online as well as ones on onlinegolftour.net.  The game also has a cool replay feature that allows you to watch the last shot from a number of different angles.  Your opponent(s) can see the replays as well.Another big plus for PerfectGolf is the freecam mode which allows you to more effectively read putts and scope out your next shot, even while your online opponent is getting ready to hit.  Take a virtual tour of the entire course from every conceivable angle and soak in the wonderful immersion that this game provides.PerfectGolf has lived up to its potential as superb golf simulation.  Every update over the last year has shown improvement, especially the most recent update from last month.  This community driven game will only get better in the months and years to come.  Be sure to give it a try and you won't be disappointed.  ",5,0,0,0,1,0,0

								I love golf games and Perfect Golf seemed very promising. But if you are used to golf games like tigers woods, you will have a hard time adapting to this game. The physics engine is very hard to predict and it lacks alot of things that tiger woods games did very well. All in all, I really do not think $20 is worth it. The game has a big learning curve, and maybe it is rewarding to learn it, but the game is just kinda boring. I understand it is an indie game and still is in its early stages. But even still, a 20 dollar price tag is a bit too much.5/10			",16,1,0,6,2,0,3

When you are in the rough on the other side of a bunker you should still have a loft option.-	Bots to play match-play against.  Not always possible to complete an 18 hole match play against real people.  Against bots you can play a few holes at a time until the game is complete.Really looking forward to the final version of the game. ",20,7,1,10,17,1,20

								Thanks Perfect Golf staff for what is in my opinion going to be the best golf sim ever. The physics while still being tweaked in this EA version are awesome. The game can challenge you as much as you want which is a great thing. Golf is a game with so many variables and this game really brings that to life. You can dribble a ball off the tee or bust it 300 yards down the middle. All dependent on the quality of the swing you make. Just looking forward to how this game improves with the final version and all the courses that will be released. I couldn't imagine a better start a golf sim than what these guys have given us with the hard work they have put in.

								Haven't played a golf game in quite a while. Although used to play the Links games a lot, which this reminded me of. It looks lovely and offers what I always wanted in a golf game visually and physically.Little things like the player model clipping through severe slopes and clubs not being obviously accessible can be overlooked at this stage because the core of the game works well enough. There were very minor visual things that actually bothered me. The courses look wonderful, and the ball physics are pretty close to spot on which swayed me to buy it. My only real gripe is I'd like a fixed player camera, having the camera zoom in on the ball after impact gets a bit annoying after every shot.Right now I'd recommend it because if this turns out to have its own easy to use course editor/creator, and has all of the important tweaks and suggestions addressed, then right now for a golf sim, it is a total steal. Looking forward to seeing what comes from this!			",47,2,0,1,2,2,1

Early Access Review
								I've been playing golf and computer games for about 25 years now, ever since I was about seven years old, so I feel reasonably qualified to comment on something that combines the two.The early access of Perfect Golf is a fantastic start and the devs appear to have every motivation to bring the game to full fruition. Unlike many early access titles, the devs at Perfect Golf aren't promising heaven and earth just to get people's money but they are promising to create a great golf sim for real golfers, something I firmly believe they are very capable of delivering.The current basic build is solid and enjoyable enough to hint at what is to come. Of course it has some bugs and it is missing many features and some areas require polish but these are all being identified and dealt with systematically and professionally as far as I can tell.For anyone looking to buy this game in its current form, note that it does not yet have the following features which some may want to wait for:- Computer opponents- Career mode- Golfer appearance customisation- Statistics and TrackingI would also say that, while the game looks very nice on my machine in ultra high detail at 1080p (you need a proper gaming graphics card here by the way), the golfer animation could be doing with being more fluid and the feeling more solid when the ball is struck or impacts the turf. It just feels a little floaty at this point with the golfer, terrain and ball all having a slightly disconnected feel. Additionally, the wind conditions seem to have no effect on the trees or flag; at 50mph the trees move identically to when the wind is at 10mph.On the other hand, the in flight ball physics are awesome and the mouse control ""motionswing"" mechanic is brilliant and is easily the closest feel to a real golf swing that I've experienced in a PC golf game. This mechanism puts the onus on the tempo and rhythm of your swing rather than just how straight you can move the mouse back and through (anyone remember table edging?). Downswing too fast and the ball is going left, too slow and it's going right, similar to real golf. If you let the pressure get to you and you lose your tempo, you're in trouble, just like real golf.Also, the real time weather and sky conditions make everything feel a lot more realistic and help with immersion.At this point there are no computer opponents and no sort of career mode but these are planned. Additionally, there is no golfer or gear customisation beyond being able to select which 14 clubs you want in your bag.If you are a new starter (or even if you're not), here are my top ten tips for bringing down your scoring and increasing your enjoyment of the game:1) go to options and change the camera to track your shot because it's a static camera by default which is boring2) bring up the map using the button on the top right of the screen to allow for easier aiming3) right clicking in the power circle allows you to change club and select normal or chip shot type4) right clicking again in the power circle allows you to alter the trajectory or add fade/draw bias5) read the instructions and practice with motionswing. It may be tough to start with but it's worth it when it clicks!6) The marker on the putting green has nothing to do with power, only direction. The centre point on the putting power bar is the power needed to reach the hole on a flat green. You need to go past this point if you want to putt uphill7) activate the terrain slope graphics for normal shots as well as putts because the ball being above or below the feet will send the ball left or right respectively8) wind seems to have smaller effects on the ball than in other golf games but once the speed goes above 20mph it starts to have more of an impact9) go into your golfer settings and swap something out for a 64deg wedge. This is easily the most useful club in the bag behind the driver and the putter10) if you want to chat in a multiplayer game, hit enterAs far as multiplayer goes, it is currently based on a peer to peer hosting system with the normal modes of play you would expect and a few unusual ones. Since there is no central server yet you need to ensure you have a fast and stable internet connection if you are going to host a game. Otherwise, ask someone with a better connection to be the host. My experiences have been mostly positive as both host and guest with no disconnections but perhaps I have been lucky with my opponents.From memory I think there are 6 courses currently to choose from and new ones are being added regularly as part of the updates.If you are a fan of golf and you are looking for a proper golf simulator you should buy this game now.If you enjoy golf games in general but want a career mode, customisable equipment and computer opponents, check back in 6-12 months.If you want to pretend you are a superhuman who can drive the ball 400 yards and impart spin with the power of your mind, go play Tiger Woods.

												""this is based on not even an hour of gameplay as i have to go to sleep so i can wake up for work which starts in an hour.Firstly this is quite possibly the best golf game in recent years that i have played certainly better than alot of past titles (im looking at you EA) liking the motion swing and i really like the way the shots just feel right.The graphics though not amazing are really good, though really what can you do with a golf game graphically without taking away from the whole simulation end of it. I would add though that the course that i played on seemed lifeless, i mean it would be great even in solo play to see some other people or a caddy or something. Also noticed a little bit of jitter on the comet trail when the ball starts to drop after the peak of the shot.AI is needed for solo play The only other bad thing i can think of is the sound design, in florida glades i can hear the ambience track looping. This may not sound like that big of a gripe but once you notice it it becomes infuriating and to have the same sound effect on all 18 holes in the track... well just play it and you will understand. I dont know if this is the same in the other courses but this must be a testament to how good the game is i cant wait to find out cos it is a brilliant game.Also. this is early access but i couldnt help but notice there is a pro shop... all the values are $0 at the moment but i cant help but wonder if this is going to become a game that ends up cashing in big style after its release. If you can win money during games thats okay but if you are going to be asking $200 for a golf club that absolutely obliterates any competition this game is going to go south fast! Other than that early access is good i like it and i will continue to play more of it.. And now im late for work bye""I was correct on one thing, this game is a cash grab after release, save your money and actually buy a set of golf clubs, trust me its cheaper			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Having played EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 for several years, it was nice to come across Perfect Golf, the game is still in it's beta stage at this point, but i can say that so far i am very impressed, game play is good, although there are a few teeathing problems which will probably get resolved over time before the game is released in its full capacity. Graphics are awsome. Things that need attention is at  this stage the arrows on the key pad have no use, it would be very usefull to incorporate tha arrows to move left ,right, forward and back as in TW 08, also at this moment you cannot choose your own cloathing clubs etc, i am sure these both will be in the game when released. But bottom line is i am Impressed with the game so far, and would encourage you to try this out if you are a keen online Golf gamer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								It's a pretty golf game for sure. Nice layout, easy controls, gorgeous graphics.The camera is clunky, the shot replay sucks and it feels very dull with nothing highlighting Birdies, Eagles,  and Hole in ones.POST EARYLY ACCESSI reviewd this well before it was called what it is. I would never have signed my name to this game, it is hot garbage. The graphics are still gorgeous, but for any seemingly amount of fun, or enteractivity as a gamer, it sucks. My games keep crashing when trying to play a CPU opponent, sad. FPS is dog shti slow and I can run Fallout 4 on 80FPS. Don't bother with it, it's a sad cache in on a golf genre.

Early Access Review
								I have followed Perfect Golf for over two years and looked to participate in Kickstarter.  The release of EA finally arrived and I duly jumped and bought.  My initial reaction was one of regret because I couldn't achieve any level of gameplay.  Obviously my somewhat aged system was not up to the job.  Following advice posted around the forums I downgraded my graphic settings to minimum and suddenly I was playing the game.  My old eyes don't appreciate HD graphics so what I was seeing, looked fine to me.  What I'm trying to say is that I've needed to take the graphic demand to the minimum but am still finding a game I can play and learn.  Learning that there is little or no margin of error on the snap; the effect of moving the ball forward or backward in my stance; the influence of real time weather on the view of the game.  As an EA version of the game the potential seems massive and perhaps one day I may be able to afford a system to run it properly or perhaps I just need a new graphics card but in the meantime, I can still knock the ball into the water or the rough.

								Ok so this game is pretty fun for a golf game. There are only a few concerns that i can bring up that they need to fix.1. Sometimes you can get your ball to bounce out of a bunker and as far as I know, bunkers aren't trampolines.2. Putting power and the power system. There is a a line that is what is the recommended strength for the the putt but it says you may have to adjust yourself based on the incline/decline of the putting green. This is false. If you go above the line on average putts it doesn't change the power at all. Same goes for if you go below the line. Chips and bunker shots have the same kind of wonky thing happening. 3. Wind. Wind seems to have little to no effect on the ball's trajectory even at 17-19 mph.4. Your persons legs disappear when standing on an incline.5. The in game sound is insanely loud, even when  you put everything at 4% of the 100% possible. For me, 1% is about perfect.6. Ball spin. If you position the shot to where you get underneath the ball when you swing, backspin should accompany the shot as well as the shot going shorter than normal because it should increase the arc on the ball. No such thing happens. The ball goes farther and when it lands no backspin happens. Instead when you don't position it at all and just swing normally your ball will get this weird ghost backspin that happens for no reason. Topsin has a similar effect where the ball doesn't change trajectory at all other than it flys shorter than normal. No ball spin happens when it lands as well.If they can touch up a few of these mechanics they have in the game but have no effect on it then this game will literally be perfect golf. Except for like, real golf...			",34,5,1,10,6,0,1

								I like the graphics, and the gameplay in large part.I like that the game has a game lobby and discussion area - unlike TGC.It is in early access now so I presume it will eventually have some needed additional features such as:1) ability to better personalize the golfer avatars,2) ability to play multiplayer in a ready golf style to speed up play - for example, players could watch each other tee off, then they would proceed individually to their own balls and hit simultaneously, until they were close to or on the green, then could watch each other putt, If I remember correctly golf games with online multiplayer in the past did something like this.3) more courses - including player made.This all said, I purchased an additional copy of the early access version to play online with my friend. So I definitely recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								While this game is still in early stages of development to give a full review I have to give props to Perfect Parallel for listening to their fan base. Being disabled myself and haveing friend that are disabled Perfect Parallel let us use the option for the 3 click swing which for some is the only way they can play. So thank you PP for listening, can't wait to see what the future holds for Perfect Golf. Thinking of The Golf Club by HB Studios instead? Don't. Search HB Studios in Steam and check out the reviews for their games. HB Studios absolutley does not support or listen to the disabled comunity or even their own fanbase. Like I said listening to the community is a big plus for Perfect Parallel.			",62,6,5,5,19,2,3

								Perfect golf has something that I just can't quite nail down.  All I can say is the more I play it, the more I like it.  At first I was not impressed.  The up close texures of the grass and rough were so bad that I almost gave up on it.....but I didn't.  I kept playing and have really enjoyed how the game plays.  The overall look has grown on me, especially since I figured out that I can change the time of day using the ""dynamic sky"" feature.  When I changed the time of day to evening it really made a big difference to me.  All of the sudden, slight elevation changes were more noticable and the shadows cast gave everything a more lifelike feel.  Being a golfer, the ball flight physics seem very realistic, although some tweaks are needed in certain areas which is to be expected in early access.This game is still in ""rough draft"" form but I can see the potential for a really great golf game.  I hope the Developers have the time and are driven to make the necessary changes during this early access period because this game has the potential to be great!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								As noted several times this is an early release game and shows great promise. Well done to the team at Perfect Parallel! Listen to your users and implement what is practical and achievable and a magnificent game will result. I did enjoy comments from another reviewer regarding the ""emergent physics"" used. If this is the differentiator to other golf sims then with further gameplay and feature development this has the potential to be better than the Green Jacket wearer of golf games being Links Golf.Works well on my 18 month old MAC. A little ""choppy"" at times but still adjusting graphics settings to find the sweet spot.I'm a keen golfer playing off 12 and much prefer the sim style of game, i.e. rounds of 65s - 80s and NOT the 50s you'd often see at the top of leaderboards on Links. Hopefully a blend of EA Tiger Woods (ease of play and visuals) and Links (gameplay and options) can be found.Finally regarding the Course Forge tool. Agreed this will be a welcome addition to enable continued course development although BUT without a ""perfect"" gameplay experience the product will be lacking.			",0,0,0,0,2,0,0

								I've been following the development of this golf simulation for a fair while, really pleased to have a chance to play on EA.I am using the three click meter, and having spent a bit of time on the practice range, I have just completed my first full round off of Members tees. I think they have got this just about spot-on as regards ball physics. I play golf off of a handicap of 12 and it is the first time I have played a golf simulation that just seems to feel right.I have played golf games in the past, and you won't be seeing ridiculous rounds with scores in the 40's and 50's, you will not see this here. There are obviously areas where the sim can be improved, as would be expected for EA. I think some of the users who have been critical need to give the devs some time to get things implemented and improved upon, as I'm sure they will be.I really think Perfect Golf has a bright future, especially when CourseForge is added.

								No idea how many different golf games I've played over the years, just say alot. This being an early release keep in mind the retail version will be much improved. I find the game very entertaining and highly addictive, motion swing is awesome, tried mouse swinging before and did not like it. 3 click swing works well also. While there are some things not quite perfected the game works extremely well, it's only major downfall is the horsepower required to run it (maxed out), I run it on the lower end graphics wise and it plays very smoothly, on the higher settings it looks fabulous but I get a tiny bit of lag. So if you love a good golf game that could become great, check it out now, it's cheaper.Some 300 hrs later, this game is so worth 20 bucks. to many good things added since last year to mention.

Early Access its a bargain and it's only getting better, for some it can be frustrating with updates and working through bug issues. For $20 my playtime in game is down to 1 cent per hour.

Early Access Review
								Pros: The graphics on Ultra High settings, look great. Of course, I only expect them to get better as development continues, and as the community gets ahold of the CourseForge to create custom courses.As would be expected, the Early Access version of this game has some issues with the swing meters. However, I still feel that this game has a good foundation to build on with the current meters. Looking forward to the later builds to see what each swing meter feels like.Also, the simple, in-game match making and chat is decent for an Early Access title. Cons:There still seems to be a lot room for growth in this title. Most of the things I would say need to be fixed have already been touched on by other reviewers. However, I would have to differ in my opinion of the severity of the negative comments. I think that the main areas that will help improve the quality of this release are more player customization options, refined motion swing meter / character interaction, and more courses(...CourseForge).Overall, I am happy with the quality for such an early version of what has the potential to be an amazing golf game. Like I said, I am truly excited about the release of CourseForge, as I believe it will add a great deal of value to this release. I think that some people expect more from Early Access titles, and may be a little harsh on the developers. I hope that they will be able to take the feedback they are receiving, and turn this game into the next big thing in golf simulation software.			",7,0,0,5,8,1,3

								I have been an hardcore TWPC player and course designer for 10yrs now, love that game. So believe me, my measuring stick was TWPC08 for this game.. Well, it has surpassed my measuring stick and has blown me away.. This game makes me feel how I did when I first got that game in 04.  I don't just say that easily.. I know there is plenty of room for improvement but at this stage it is coming along super. With the help of every one here and at the PG site..This is the future for golf on pc, the Game Lobby is very user friendly and it even has Private In-game chat, big plus..Not to mention all the real world physics. The water is awesome too..So come on and let your suggestions or concerns be known, trust me these Dev's/Admins are such a pleasure to have worked with as a tester... They really do listen... They will listen to the community which is a refreshing bonus from another closed down golf  game that went under because of not listening to the community...So let's here from you and keep it on the good grass..Axe			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								I've played golf games since the mid-early 90's (Links) and leading modern titles like Tiger Woods Golf and Perfect Golf is among the best of them. What is amazing is this game is 'early access' and yet is still capivating to play, despite the rough edges which will, no doubt, be smoothed out as the game development progresses. Top impressions include: stunning procedural computer graphics (my machine is Apple iMac w/ i5 CPU) and the best golf physics engine I've seen on a game ever. Like real golf, Perfect Golf isn't easy. You won't be breaking par anytime soon, and perhaps ever if you turn off all the ""aids"" and tackle the courses at the hardest settings levels. I'm a former 3 handicapper and take my real golf seriously. There are no gizmos and fake PGA tour galleries...just great, accurate physics simulated golf. This is good virtual training for good real golfers and will help you hone your 'course management' skills. One last point, at some point users will be able to tap PerfectForge and design their own courses with a tool that is much more professional and capable than the Greg Norman Course Designer at The Golf Club game.

Early Access Review
								Have had limited experience with computer golf games, really only a few years. I began playing WGT on a recommendation from a friend but quickly realized the game was just not what I was looking for. A quick web search brought this game to my attention and I must say it is fascinating, addictive, challenging, frustrating...everything I love about golf IRL. The game physics, swing choices, difficulty levels and available courses at this time provide all the entertainment value anyone could ask in an extremely affordable EA package.The Forums are friendly and extremely informative. What really has my interest is the pending addition of Course Forge where you can try your hand at designing a golf course. I have never even imagined trying something like that, and when it is released, I full well expect to spend a great deal of time developing the necessary skills to create an experience for mouse golfers and SIM's alike. As the game sits right now, I find it playable and it can only get better. The adjustability of setting allows me to experience fantastic graphics and a very immersive experience.I would recommend this game to anyone.			",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

								Starting to really like it. I played my first full round with Motion Swing and it felt really good, it gives you a more tactile feeling of timing and speed instead of the usual 3 mouse click thing. Theres's still some bugs to iron out and some optimization to be done but for an Early Release it's very impressive. I cannot wait for Perfect Golf to support some launch monitors !!!

With game play difficulty from hacker (beginner) to Tour Pro (very challenging) and multiple swing types (3-click, Motion Swing,  soon to be added real time swing with mouse and controller) you will find a style of play that suits you. This game/sim has come a long way since early access began.

								I have been playing computer golf starting with Hi Res Golf for the Apple II with 64K of memory.  I have played just about all the golf games out there including Tiger Woods Online.  For early access I find the game very enjoyable to play.  The real time ball physics is a very good new innovation.  Real time ball physics will make it the closest game to playing real golf.  It still needs some work but I have faith that the PP team are dedicated to making this the best PC golf game.  They are fixing bugs and making small changes recommended by the players almost every day.  I am confident that eventually they will have most all of the features that other golf games have.  I was an alpha tester and compared to all other games I tested these people listen.  So if there is something you want or don’t like post your ideas in the forums.			",5,1,0,0,3,0,0

								Perfect Golf has a diligent and communicative team of developers. They are constantly in-touch with the players as tweaks and upgrades are made to the game. As is true of any Early Release game there are gliches along the way that can be frustrating, but patience and ""smart feed back"" to the developers helps them immensly. I have been enjoying this game nearly everyday since it appeared as Early Release. Those of you reading this should know that for just $20 you are getting involved with the BEST EVER golf simulation for PC and Console. Without rambling on about the virtues of the game, I just want to say that getting onboard NOW will be the right time, the right price and all the help from devs and other expert members in the forum http://www.perfectparallel.com will keep you well informed not only about this wonderful game but also many technical question you may have about your computer and it's components.-Crusher			",0,0,0,0,2,0,0

Early Access Review
								In my opinion this is the best golf game available. I own others but now only play this one. The big difference for me is the swing mechanic. On the higher difficulty settings the real-time-swing actually requires a skilled effort at the swing. Other games I have played recently (such as TGC) are OK but the swing on those just seems so easy - also like you go on auto-pilot when swinging - and gets a little boring. Not so with Perfect Golf as you need to pay attention to your swing.I also like that the physics of the game determine where the ball ends up - it is not predetermined as some other games are.Graphics are decent as well, but I don't have a high end video card and so cannot comment much on that aspect. All I can say is that it is comparable to other recent PC golf titles I have played.As for the number and variety of courses, it is getting better now with more user-designed courses being released.  In my opinion the variety and quality of courses is what is important rather than sheer numbers. Currently, even in early access, I see variety of courses in Perfect Golf getting better and better. They are quality tracks with a good range of difficulties available.  As the Perfect Golf course designing community grows there will be even more courses of varying visual styles getting released on top of an already great set of courses. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Not a recommended game. Ball and its movement on greens is horrible. It's like shooting on wax paper. 3 click system is totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You get no help, no preview of shot or anything. In 3 click if you like that, you will never figure out where your ball is going. If you miss center mark, you are screwed. You can play single player and take a million mulligans. Single player really all there is in this game. I just find this game very amateur and bare, missing lots of things. Calling it Perfect Golf is a just a lie. Nothing Perfect about it. I played PGA Tour/Tiger Woods, WGT and even Leaderboard golf in the old days. Hopefully that other golf game coming on steam will end this game.Don't bother.			",217,8,9,16,15,3,19

Multiplayer is very robust with numerous modes of play such as Team Alternate Shot and Team Skins match plays.Swing types includes motion swing and 3 click.  Next update, due out this weekend, will include realtime mouse swing and realtime controller swing.If you own a simulator such as GC2, Skytrak, or Trackman 3/4, you've got to get this game.  Playing PG on the simulator is as close to the real thing as you can get.  To watch my videos, go to youtube and search for GC2 skytrak online golf tour.			",0,1,2,1,2,0,1

								Scroll down for my updated review I LIKE THIS MUCH MORE NOW. (old review) This is absulotely terrible! You can't make a game that looks sooo pretty but plays terribly. I have played every Links Golf Series, ive played PGA Tour on the Ipad, ive probably played every golf sim since the Atari 800 XL The control of the power bar is completely rediculous the swinginmg is way way way off. If you move your golfers position farther to the left and then take a swing and it misses the mark and goes just a little bit the ball curves to the left WAY WAY WAY left not equalling the strength and the way the ball should be going. The Physics are all wrong. The Mouse buttons to stop on the swingdown is not consistant and sometimes it does not respond ir it responds late and the swing goes way to the left or the right.  There are not any cheers or announcers.  Links 2003 a game that is 12 years old plays better than this game, it may not look as animated and as perty as this game but at least you can have fun playing the game. This being said this is still in BETA and Im really hoping this game improves cause wasting $20 doesnt make me a happy camper.UPDATE**************** Ok im Liking it more the past 2 days. Ive figured out that i can change the settings to make it easier for starters. I was playing the Pro setting. Also the swing is easier than i thought HOWEVER its way too sensitive sending the ball right or left even if your barey left or right of the downswing marker. I have a pretty good PC with lots of memory and 3 core etc the graphics are very choppy when set to best, so I lowered it and it playes great and even though its not on the highest settings it looks 420X better than LINKS, Tiger Woods etc.. I wish there were more sounds of people clapping , announce team etc..  Im upgrading my review rom above..			",9,2,0,1,4,0,1

Obviously it's an early release so not as polished and perfect as it could be, but the potential is huge. Can't wait for the new updates to start coming through. I hope the old PC Links golf community get behind this one as it deserves to be a huge hit. Best new PC golf game by a country mile.Microsoft don't buy this game and bury it enough said!

(push the boundary Dev's).Thats about it.I have both Perfect Golf and The golf Club.Comparisons are not fair to either game.Get them both to make up you own mind.			",35,5,1,4,11,0,0

								Having played golf games for absolutely years, it's a really pleasant change to play something that feels like a simulator rather than the type of arcade thing that Tiger Woods has turned into.Playing Perfect Golf reminds me of Links and also PGA Championship - another old game that used the mouse (although that system was a bit flawed).The new swing model of Perfect Golf is genuinely good - it'll take you a bit of practice to get it, but what I like is that you can hit quite alot of decent shots (neither truly awful or perfect) that makes the game feel more like the real thing. I've only been playing it for the past few days, and my gripe is about  some of the graphics performance - it's pretty stuttery even with a Radeon HD7770, latest drivers and 8GB ram. But reading some of the other comments that may be just something about the latest release (it doesn't get any better using the lower graphics settings either). Otherwise, the courses look beautiful.I hope they keep up the good work on Perfect Golf - there's every chance it'll develop into the type of golf sim that's been simply non-existant for PC owners.

								First, let me say that the gameplay and interface have overall left me with a very positive impression. As regards the gameplay in particular, it is indeed excellent, although even at the easiest setting the shot meter is very unforgiving. A slight miss off the center line, left or right, yields an erring shot in no man's land. So you better hone your reflexes. That caveat notwithstanding, the game is great fun. Kudos to the developers at this stage of development.Now, on the less positive side: the graphics are nice, but a bit disappointing, if we consider that they are roughly on par with the graphics in the game Links 2003. I must say, however, that I am here comparing the best and most recent offerings of this old game, with respect to available courses, and the likes of Shardowlands in Perfect Golf. Still I find that the vegetation, especially the foliage of leafy trees, could and should be better, more polished and photo realistic. I would likewise welcome some flowers in places to add a touch of color and variety to this green fest. Also, even with the antialiasing on, there are still some noticeable jagged edges. Keep in mind that I have the graphical settings at ultra high, with max resolution of 1440 P. In short, I believe there is still work to be done on the part of the developers when it comes to graphics.Clearly, and quite predictably at this stage, there is also a lot of work to be done when It comes to available courses, clubs, and avatars. Furthermore, I would love to see an array of AI opponents of different skill levels for off-line games.I suggest Perfect Parallel include a store in the game to give the option of considerably expanding the content at a reasonable cost. I personally have no issue with financially rewarding the developers (like the competent course designer Mike Jones) for this most promising game. Yes, I am hooked, albeit with some reservations at the present time. I am truly burning with anticipation, thinking of what is to follow for us golf lovers. Let us hope for the best.

								I've been playing this since day 1 of release and I can honestly say that it's the closest thing to real life golf you can currently get on PC.The motion swing alone provides a level of control that will be hard to beat and when you add-in the great courses and multiplayer you get a PC golf experience that promises fantastic things.Yes it's early access and there are plenty of issues to iron out, elements to add-in and areas to generally improve upon but if it this early glimpse is what we have to judge it by, the guys at Perfect Parallel will have a winner on their hands.If you're in any way interested in PC golf, grab yourself a copy at the early access price and enjoy the ride.

								This isn't the best Golf simulator I have ever played that distinction goes to Tiger Woods the Masters on Wii but Perfect Golf is a decent one,  Some reviewers have made a comparison to the now defunct MS Links. I can see the comparison but this game in its current incarnation isn't quite as good as that game. I have also played The Golf Club and that one I would say is the more polished game if I were to compare it to this one. The control scheme is also completely different, this game gives you the choice of swinging with your mouse or using a three click system which is my prefered method of control for this game. As others have stated there are a limited number of golf courses to play on at the moment but the game is still a work in progress so I'm sure that will change over time. If you have a spare 20 bucks to blow I would give it a shot if you are looking for a PC or Mac golf game that is easy to pick up and play but hard to master.			",186,10,33,10,73,16,44

								Been waiting for this for some time and it was thoroughly worth the wait. Didn't have to spend a year to learn the game as you can be shooting in the seventies by the second round as I was. It is not easy from there. It shall be many months before I could claim a round average in the low seventies even playing on the easier of the two modes of operation and on the easiest of four settings within that mode. You will get value for money with this game as I see myself never mastering it. The quality of the courses I believe are of a very high standard, better than any other golf sim to date. The in flight ball physics are, in my opinion, near perfect.  Some other ball physics, not so good. Irregular bounce and bounce height need to be tweaked, ball travels too freely through heavy long grass, inconsistent spin on and around greens and ball holds on a bunker face. There is no lie indicator and once on the green the putting, in general, I found it to be a little easy. But it is early access and as it is with early access there is some work to do which the PP team are already at it. I have no doubt that the team behind this game have their hearts in it and in my opinion they are in this for the long haul, because of this I am unable to see this venture falling over. The game has huge potential.			",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

								Hi guys. For being a beta mode and playable, PP has a lot of potential. I can't compare  PP to the other golf game we know so well. PP still has a lot to dial in. But HEY it's a starting point. :) I didn't like the approach shots to well. When you hit the rough or land on the fringe the ball gets very squirrely like a pin ball machine. I hope that gets worked out. The graphics are decent. PP needs an ALT shot game. When you want to set up stroke game I suggest to lower the number of players from 8 to 4.Connection issues are slim to none. Haven't got kicked out or timed out yet woot woot!!. I'll post more as I play more. So strokem good guys and have funchilimatt			",5,0,0,4,6,0,0

Early Access Review
								Have been following this game for a while now.   The game, at this point, will not dazzle you with its graphics (I'm playing all graphics options maxed out, btw), but what it lacks in glitz, it makes up for with the truest golf mechanics and 'feel' that I've yet come across in a golf video game.    I originally started out with the 3-click meter, because that's what I would normally default to after toying around with other games' motion swings (be it the Wiimote, PS controller or mouse).  However, after deciding to give this game's motion swing a try, I'm hooked.    Finally, a game that nails it.  The motion swing is fantastic.   It feels natural and organic, whether on the full swing, chipping or putting.    It's also deep, and difficult (playing with the assists at 'minimal') but with practice, you see improvement as you start to gain feel and muscle memory, just like in real golf.   The game also provides you with numerical feedback (on the driving range practice mode) to illustrate the errors and there is a guide on Steam that explains the numbers.  In short, there are 3 components - tempo, swing path and face contact, all determined by the speed and directions you move your mouse.  The core game is solid.  Once they put some more spit and polish on this and throw in the course forge and other features, it may just be the definitive golf sim that people have been waiting forever for.

								I'm a big fan of the Early Access model. It gives indie game developers a chance to release games that enthusiasts will help test and report bugs + have the opportunity to request new features. This obviously tells me that the game is far from complete and the only way it's going to get better [no matter what state it's in] depends on the participation/involvement of the user base.After having played Perfect Golf for a few hours it was clear to me that the skills of course design, that Mike, Andrew and the rest of the PP team have shown - time and again - in the courses they have released for Links 386, have been solidly brought forward to PG. The courses aren't just beautiful and difficult but the attention to detail is amazing. The live water, real-time weather, blend of grass etc. looks stunning and it makes the game very enjoyable. Although we currently only have 5 courses available, I'm enjoying every single minute of playing this game and helping to report back any issues I have found.The areas of improvement that I see as most significant are 1) make online-play smooth for everybody 2) improve the clunky interface where we join and set-up games, etc. 3) make the ball physics a bit more realistic/tough when rolling around in the rough.Features that I'm hoping will be added are 1) the ability to be able to create private games 2) the ability to see who is hosting/taking part in a game (Steam name) 3) the addition of a Break Line Indicator (similar to the one in Links).This game is only going to get better and better and be a huge success. I'm actually building a brand spanking new PC, so I can enjoy the stunning graphics to its fullest:-)Keep up the good work chaps!			",18,0,0,0,1,0,0

								So far I like the mechanics of the game. The 3 click shot seems to be the better of the two methods, I find the motion swinging is somewhat limited without having the ability to alter stance or hand position. It also is very cumbersome when putting.One feature which is missing is the ablitly to view the green prior to shooting, I'm not sure why that would be omitted but I'm sure it will be in at some point. Good start. Woud be nice to seem some sort of incremental and significant update to game fairly early on.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The best looking golf sim I've ever seen and a blast to play.... coming over from Links, it's taken all of the things I loved about the look and feel of that game and improved upon it - the course textures look and play similar, but now we have daylight, better shadows, moving water and plants, weather effects. I'm happy with the ball physics so far and the difficulty level is not overwhelming to start. Obviously some things in early access are limited, like the lack of courses and customization, but the beauty is that the developers of the game are open to almost any suggestion and are always out to improve the product. When this game brings about some of those features and also brings in the course design program to allow an unlimited amount of user created content - the sky will be the limit.			",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

								Brutal at times, but rewarding.Like others have said, clearly the best PC golf game available. Don't expect an EA Tiger Woods console experience and you will be fine. A lot of work left to be done, but hopefully it will improve with each update. At it's purest it provides a great multiplayer experience, you won't find any reason to play alone except maybe to adjust your difficulty or swing format. When you make a great shot you really do feel the same satisfaction as you might with a real round of golf. I've tried motion controls and minimum assists but it felt too similar to my real life golf game. Much more fun and still challenging with the 3-click and help. Hoping this one gets the support it deserves so we can finally have a great PC golf game.			",57,59,4,22,12,5,8

It's sometimes difficult, but so is real golf...The last update fixed a lot of network bugs and that has been the biggest improvement I feel. I love that you play PvP live and not a ghost like TheGolfClub. If you like World Golf Tour, you're going to love this. Active devs that push regular updates so I highly doubt this will be abandoned. A steal at $20. Buy with confidence. Hit em' straight!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								If you enjoyed Links LS, you should feel at home with Perfect Golf. The courses are beautiful, and the risks/rewards for different types of shots adds to the satisfaction of a hole well played. If this is released for the OUYA, it would be one of the few games I'd purchase for multiple devices.I'm looking forward to some best ball scrambles in the near future.			",33,2,0,6,9,0,0

								This is the pinnacle for a PC golf sim to date. There is much work to be done as it is Early Access. I will be watching and playing as this sim developes.Support this developer because this is looking and feeling like a good golf sim.			",139,68,0,39,36,5,49

								This is the 1st time I have ever felt the need to write a review of a game, but wow, been playing golf games since Leaderboard on the C64 30 odd years ago all the way through to TW14, and this is the best and most realistic simulation of golf I have ever come across (I also play golf). The courses are great and look realistic, ball flight and physics is pretty much spot on. You can tell a lot of hard work has gone into the making of this game, ensuring that it looks and feels like real golf. All thats really missing is a few more extras and a few more options, different avatars, maybe a career option in single player etc. But other then that, this game is almost there. 9.5/10			",13,4,1,5,28,1,8

								I've been playing PC golf games for over 20 years and I have to say this is, bar none, the best golf sim I've yet to play.  Beautifully rendered golf courses are a pleasure for the eye but the real secret is what lies behind the surface.  Their use of real life physics in real time within the game creates a golf gaming experience that is unrivaled.  It is quite amazing how well it recreates the ""feel"" of golfing and that may well be the magic ingrediant that this game has.  Considering that this is early access it boggles my mind as to where the developers may take this game in the future.  If they keep this up, and I have no doubt they will, this game should become the gold standard in golf simulation.			",0,0,0,0,2,0,0

								I really like Perfect Golf. It has the look and feel of the PGA Championship PC game that I used to play, but Perfect Golf has the advantage of a strong and growing on-line capability thanks to STEAM. I have just several minor complaints about the game. First, I wish that the wind was more of a factor in the game to make players think a little more about how to shape shots. Clever  players could then hit fades and draws on purpose to hold the ball against the wind, or use the wind more to move around dogleg corners depending on the situation.Second, I don't believe that players are penalized enough when hitting into or out of the trees. I have seen many shots go right through the trees like they were thin air, when in real golf the tree limbs or leaves would have knocked the ball down. Fairway bunker shots also seem a little too easy compared to real golf.Lastly, I suspect that some of the players out there that are using the Motion Plus method to swing the club are using a track or some other kind of aid to move their mouse perfectly each time. It's too much of a coincidence that they have the same shot shape everytime, especially when consistently hitting it with over 100% power. That creates an unfair advantage over those players who use the tri-click method. I recommend that you allow just the tri-click method for on-line play to guarantee that no player has an advantage over any other.			",5,0,1,0,2,0,0

								Well, this is my first review for any game...But this is brillant. Be aware, that it is early access, but the potential is huge. This is for the hardcore simulation-golfer.Forget about it if you were the TigerWoods-arcadestyle player, this is the real deal.This is the real successor to Links2k3.I cant wait for the future updates.

								Fantastic experience so far with this upcoming title.  The dev team, although small, continues to run in the right direction and I really see this becoming a top contender if the long term goals are met.  The putting feels more of a read to read than a click to click and the ball physics around the course is coming along nicely.			",25,0,0,1,3,0,7
