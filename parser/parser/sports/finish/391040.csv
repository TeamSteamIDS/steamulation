												I was skeptical at first, I must admit. 4 hours in and I am more than happy with my purchase of F1 2016.So, last years iteration caught a lot of flak due to the game being practically incomplete (no safety cars, career mode, ect.) Not only that, but it was riddled with bugs to the point where it was practically unplayable. Now, normally, I would be irritated by this, but I cut Codemasters some slack. It was their first shot at an entirely new game engine. Surely, F1 2016 would be an improvement...Well? It most certainly is. With my expectations being low, Codemasters BLEW them out of the water. While the game is not PERFECT, I am finding it far more enjoyable than previous F1 titles I have invested in. There are minor graphical glitches here and there (stupid little things that won't hinder your gameplay, at least not that I've encountered). Better Yet, not once in 4 hours did the game crash to the desktop! I'm in awe!All in all, thank you, Codemasters, for listening to your fan base. You have done us a service releasing such a well done game. Here is to the future! We can only move forward!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												They done it. This game is just so ♥♥♥♥ing awesome!!! This year I found not even ONE bug in that game. Really great job from them!The most positve thing is the Career Mode . You can make your own ""Legend"", so you can choose your own avatar, your own car number ,helmet, name... Just great! The graphics are very very good and I have no performance bug. The curbs are so much more realistic. You must drive Italy , Monza^^ The curbs are in this game so hard . I recommened: Don't tuch at turn 1 and 2 the curbs or you'll loose sooooooooooooo much time. But the thing I miss in this game (in F1 2015 it was awesome to see) ,the sparks. I haven't seen any sparks. For me are sparks a great feature and it's awesome to see ,but in F1 2016 I never seen them :/  But still this game is awesome . I had never so much fun with an F1 game like this. But another bad thing is that the Safety Car comes not everytime out when some cars retiring when they crash with another car. Only sometimes, but still . I see it quite often. The new damage is really a challenge in league races. I had a league race in Monaco , with simulation damage. And we were 20 drivers. Me and 14 other drivers survived^^ So 5 cars crashed into a wall or something else. We had 2 safety cars and 1 virtual safety car.So now again to the Career Mode. It has so much content . I  love it to upgrade the car ,to decide what you are doing. Positive+Career Mode+Safety Car+ Virtual Safety Car+great graphics+You can choose own number, helmet, name, avatar...+no bugs+good performance+you can feel the speed very good +stable multiplayer (with 22 players it's stable too)+new damage model+you can upgrade your car (R&D)+you can adjust the cams (T-cam, offset T-cam, cockpit)+new Ai difficulty (Ultimate ,very hard you need much practice)+better and realistic curbs+realistic rain car performance +you got a agent and engineer+time of day editor+manual starts+formation lap+Manual Pit Lane Entry+new practice programsThat are the things that are in F1 2016 positive . Do you want to see something from the negative side??Negative-no sparks(fixed now)-replay fps bug (it's fixed since yesterday)I have to say very big thank you to Codemasters . I really love this game!Now let's look at some screenshots I have done!! It'S really AN AWESOME GAME

												Really happy with this purchase. Generally the only F1 game (aside from F1 2013) where I felt ""That was worth the full price."".Good:- Career mode is very in depth and will keep you busy for a loooong time (I am ~25h in so far and only halfway through the first season... career mode ends at 10 (!!!) seasons).- AI is pretty good (they are fast but they also make mistakes, really enjoyable and realistic)- Strategy is very important- You can talk (with a mic) to your engineer and ask him about things like the weather forecast, strategy changes, fastest lap,...- Although I believe this game would fall into the ""simcade"" category, I really enjoy the handling and physics of the cars- Looks good and performance is decent- Encountered no bugs so far- A lot of settings to change everything to your liking (rebindable keys, tons of graphics settings, you can set camera positions and FOV, force feedback and wheel settings, HUD settings,...)- Safety Car, Virtual Safety Car and dynamic weather can change up races within minutes. No race is predictable- Although Mercedes are strong they are not dominating the game as much as in real life. The game has good balancing.- New difficulty settings make sure that you'll have a challenge even though you are very good- You can develop your car during practise now and purchase upgrades as the season goes on, like teams do in real life.- Much better damage model than in previous gamesBad:- It can be difficult to find a fitting difficulty setting at first. ""Expert"" is very slow compared to the next step called ""Legend"". But with ""Legend"" the AI is suddenly fast as ♥♥♥♥. You have to fiddle around with the settings and assists to find the perfect balance. A difficulty slider from 1-100 would have been better imo.- AI sometimes have weird strategies- Your lollipop guy keeps you hostage until there is a huge gap in the pitlane during pits. That means you can lose a lot of time if the whole grid suddenly changes tyres and goes into the pits due to a weather change or safety car for example. I had a 20+second pit stop because of that ""bug"", usually it should take 2-3 seconds.- Multiplayer is still a cluster♥♥♥♥ and will not provide clean and entertaining racing. Usually everyone crashes in the first corner and then 5 people leave the server. Not a fun experience.- No VR support- Tracks are not laser scanned and can feel a bit off if you compare them to Assetto Corsa or iRacing (especially Spa).- Sounds are better than before but I feel like they still sound a bit like advanced vacuum cleaners.Verdict:Overall a very good game with some minor flaws. But well worth the money if you are a F1 fan and don't care about clean multiplayer racing. I would only recommend this game if you have a controller or a wheel. It will probably not be a fun experience with a keyboard (like all racing games).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
