												As I have just made a request for a refund, I feel that I need to warn those who might feel tempted to purchase this game hoping it to be a decent handball game, as it is not.While it does have it's upsides, such as shooting mechanics with great potential for development and not so bad visuals and animations for certain aspects of the game even if the graphics are way below what would be expected for any sports game nowadays, it just feels to me that it is unplayable for anyone who at least remotely knows handball.It just doesn't feel like handball, the players move way too fast, motion is not fluid nor realistic, contact between players is nearly inexistent (which makes pivots quite useless, really), the ball seems to behave like a sphere of lead, controls respond way too slowly for the pace of the game, and players are mostly dumb, almost completely unaware of the game and making it impossible to actually make plays on the go without the use of ""combinations""I am very thankful for the effort put into this game, because I still have a lot of hope that one day we'll see a great handball videogame just as NBA 2K16 is a great baketball game and hope that the developers keep up the good work towards making a playable and enjoyable handball game, but handball 17 is just not there yet.For now I just hope to be refunded so I can reinvest that money into a really satisfying game, such as  Civ VI or something like that, and I'll be looking forward to seeing many of those huge problems solved in handball 18, because I'd just love to play a handball video game that feels just as good as Fifa or NBA 2K.

												This game is definitely not perfect but it is extremely enjoyable if you take the time to understand and master the controls. All handball fans will recognize the specific handball game patterns and strategies, the moves, the speed, the teams and players... and take a lot of pleasure while playing it.To those who compare this game with the big ones in the genre, and as I said in a separate thread answering to an unsatisfied buyer, a handball game will never be as good as FIFA or NBA, for the simple reason that those two games sell more than 10 million copies each year when a handball game will never surpass a few hundred thousands copies, hence the dev budget, hence the flaws you will indeed notice in the game. Handball is not be as popular as a sport as football or basket, and it is even totally unknown in a vast majority of countries. So If you want to encourage the developer, stay positive!
