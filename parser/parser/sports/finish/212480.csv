												You won't believe it... but, this is the best arcade racing game in the recent years.The transformation mechanics looks gimmicky, but it really matters and makes the game more interesting. You must not only learn handling the cars: boats and planes control extremely differently each other making the game more deep and enjoyable.The tracks are extremely well designed, both visually and technically. There are some noob friendly courses like Carrier Zone and some strongly skill indexing ones like Burning Depths or Adder's Lair. Tracks are also changing lap after lap, which is very refreshing to the standard racing formula.For many people this game may be very hard to complete on 100%. The AI isn't messing around - you WILL get hurt. But, you need to know - winning in this game is SO satisfying. You must fight all the time and even is you lose 9 times, then the 10th winning attempt will greatly repay you above your former investment. This is highly skillful game - the difficulty curve ends EXTREMELY high unlike other new racing games.NO BLUE SHELL. Automatic positive. Weapons are very well balanced for the kart racing. There is still bit of luck, however is less emphasized than in the other games from this genre.The main draw of this game is an online mode. When it works fine it is extremely enjoyable. Unfortunely there are many disconnection and lag problems that may make you Rage Quit for a while. That's not good by any means, but there is a high chance that you will get over it. The community is handling some bi-weekly tournaments so don't forget to drop on by!Overall, game is remarkably fun with bunch of refreshing mechanics that you will love to explore and use for your advantage. I highly recommend this game, especially for non-Sega fans, because this game is far FAR more than a simple fanservice you would expect.			",168,39,11,6,6,2,16

												Imagine driving through a port that has airships docked. When the port ends, you drive off of a cliff only to have your car turn into a jet. After you come down and complete a lap expecting to see the same thing, a giant airship has crashed into the port. Forcing you to drive into a path unknown, the river below where your car morphs into a boat. Mines drop into the water, sending waves that you and your rivals then need to traverse the dynamic water. On your third lap around, the airships get engaged in battle and have completely destroyed the port, causing you to have to fly through burning airships and find your way around the crashing behemoths. As you're dominating the competition on the third lap, you can hear the fans chant your name.This is Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed. Every race might be three laps with many paths, but the second and third laps usually deviate in a big way from the first. You won't just be driving cars around the 20+ courses (40+ with mirrored mode), but you'll be piloting ships and jets. The tracks are gorgeous. Themed and inspired from classic SEGA games like Sonic, Super Monkey Ball, Shinobi, Jet Set Radio, Golden Axe, Afterburner, Nights and many more. Even lesser known games like Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg get their own track. A lot of love and detail went into this game and it shows. Bright colors for some tracks, realistic lighting and texture for others. There is something here for everyone. The controls are easy yet difficult to master. Left thumbstick to steer, a button to use items, a button to look back, right stick to do tricks in mid air, right trigger to speed up and left trigger to slide / drift. Drifting around corners will not only tighten your turn radius, but if you hold it for long enough, it will boost your speed when you come out. Every character has his or her own stats: Speed, acceleration, handling, boost and all star. These stats balance out drivers. The All-Star determines how frequently you will get it from the items. When you have it, you're temporarily turned into a jet.Since this is a 'kart' style game, there are items that you'll pick up from floating red orbs. The fire crackers launch forward and bounce off of walls.  There are ice balls that come in threes and will first stun opponents. Hitting them with more ice freezes them longer. A hot rod that will give you a temporary speed boost and you can detonate it, making a ring of fire around you. A drone that will follow the driver you've selected. You can even change the driver by pointing at a new one. A simple speed boost. A spiked blowfish that you can leave on the course. Finally, one of the most creative weapons, a swarm that will charge forward and will put giant wasps on the course. It will cause drivers to weave through them.Each of these weapons can get fired ahead of you or behind you. Making everything valuable and useful. How do you defend against all these things? Well you can evade them, but there is also a glove that will catch projectiles. Not just that, but then you can throw them back.With all these weapons, they don't feel like they'll cause a winner. The game still feels skill based. The last driver won't get an item that will drop them off at first place. There is no item that will seek out and rob whomever is in the lead. It is possible that you can take such a lead that no weapon can overtake you, only your own bad driving will lose you the lead. You can also fall so far behind that nothing will bring you to the others.As you play through the game, the characters you play as will get experience. When a character levels up, he or she gets a modification. Simple things like handling or speed. They give you an extra point, but because the game feels balanced, they take away a point from something else. It is a nice system, especially when considering multi-player balance.There are boosters marked with purple arrows in the air, water and the track to move you faster. That's not the only way though. When you are in the air, you can do a trick by using the right thumb stick. If you land the trick you get a boost. If you fail, you get slowed down. The game avoids crashes. Even if you fly off the track, the screen just wipes and puts you back in the game. The tricks have another purpose when you're in the air. Left and right do barrel rolls. Up and down do flips. This makes sure that you don't jump off the track.Sega makes use of its rich history and there are plenty of drivers. Characters from Sonic's series, Crazy Taxi, Super Monkey Ball, Football Manager, Nights, Shinobi, Panzer Dragoon, Rome: Total War, Space Channel 5, Team Fortress 2 (three characters as one), an unlockable famous real life racecar driver and so many more. Wreck it Ralph is even here straight from the animated movie! Even if you've never heard of Sega or Sonic, there's always someone here to recognize. It is a huge roster of drivers and thankfully a lot of them are unlockable throughout the game's various modes.There are career modes that have your typical Grand Prix with 5 cups that have 4 races each. Each race generally lasts around 5 minutes. Complete all 5 of the Grand Prix and earn mirrored track mode. The main game mode is the World Cup that has you participating in a lot of different events for stars. You will unlock events on a sort of map. When you take part in the event you set easy, medium or hard. Each new victory will give you a star. Easy gets you one star, hard gets you three. These stars are to progress and to unlock new drivers.But with the World Cup, you don't just race. There is a whole slew of events. Drifting challenges, time challenges, battle challenges that have you destroying other racers, traffic attacks where you need to dodge other cars, vs races that pit you against another driver, ghost races that have you competing against game developer ghosts, ring races that have you flying through rings and even a perusing a tank boss to destroy it. There is a lot of variety here and I for one appreciate it.On top of that, you have local co-op and online co-op that finds you matches based on what mode you want. There are typical races, battle arenas and a few others. The process is pretty streamlined. You vote on a track from three random tracks. Then select your driver, view their license to see how good your competition is. Then you race to see who is the best.For every achievement you unlock, you get a sticker. You can place 3 stickers on your license as a flaunt or a personalization that tells other players about you at a glance. There is still in depth information to everyone, which is always nice. When you win, your online rating goes up, when you lose it goes down. It is all a nice system.When you head into a race in Grand Prix and multiplayer, you can play a slot machine for buffs. These buffs are things like ice doesn't slow you as much. You get a glove every lap. Things that mix it up, but really doesn't make anyone overpowered. The slot machine is a diversion during the loading screen. How do you get coins for the machine? On the track there are coins every so often that you can pick up. Not just that, but when a driver is hit with a weapon or falls off the track, they leave a coin. This rewards aggressive players. Plus someone else can always sneak in to take the coin.This game has a lot of content that puts it somewhere at the top of the heap when it comes to combat cart racing. While it has weapons, it is skill in the subtleties of the game that will win you races. Every track has its own flair and is a thing of sheer beauty. It is a lot of fun for anyone that needs something different yet similar to Mario Kart. It feels like a genre that was sorely missing from Steam and Sega didn't just fill that void, they hit a home run with it.			",1122,324,51,104,96,15,167

												My most treasured friend, who changed my life, gave me this game during her birthday. Without me having no idea what it was going to be about, I assumed it would have been another clone of Mario Kart, so I just wanted it for the online. But, I was astonished...YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW LONG I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR A KART RACING GAME LIKE THIS.Before I explain why this is my favorite game on steam and my Game of The Year for 2013, I'd like to give a bit of history of my experience with Kart Racing games. I've been a huge kart racing fan since SNES's Super Mario Kart. They're fun to play especially with friends but I felt they lacked something. As technology advance with the introduction of online, modern kart racing games had online sessions where you can play with others. I remember waking up early at 5am to playing Mario Kart Wii to play with a friend via online. It was fun playing with her causally, but when we played 1 v 1. The experience was boring and it felt like just playing a normal racing game since the items weren't made for 1 v 1. This made me realize that the fact is that many contemporary Kart Racing games such as Mario Kart and other MK clones aren't designed to be intense, fast or competitive. If you tried to play competitive 1 v 1, you're going to get a boring experience because modern kart racing games are design to be with 10+ players with explosives items and just pure luck. Basically, anyone can play, blindly, and it manage to win. Some may like it, but I felt it was boring because it lacked challenge.Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is the exact opposite because it is a immensely fast, competitive, challenging kart racing game. It is a game you can pick up and expect to get your butt kicked at Normal level. If you think Hard is impossible, this game offers Very Hard mode which will test your skills. It requires mastering maps and developing skills while fantastic music playing. It's like if someone mixed F-Zero with Mario Kart.Unfortunately, where the game fails is that it does not any introduction or tutorial. I highly recommend checking out guides before playing. But when you begin to master the game, you'll realize just how good, if not better, competitive kart racing games than causal fun kart racing games.  What Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed does what many kart racing games fail such is  combine map advantages, fair items, and skills together. Majority of these maps are designed for a player to use the map at their advantage such as drifting and stunts. Stunts are tricks you can perform with your right analog. Performing more than one will reward a player with a high tier boost. Drifting also plays a key role as if a player has better drifting skills than others, they're able to drift smoothly and avoid crashes and hazards. Mixing the two together can give you a insane amount of speed up to a level 6 boost. If you have some skill in stunts and drifting, you'll be able to destroy any novice played easily and make an entire lobby receive a ""Did Not Finish""Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed's items are some of the most balanced fair items I've seen on a kart racing game. Any of the items are very easy to avoid just by drifting and preforming a stunt. There items that shoot directly, set traps, or just gain boosts. The most interesting is the Bees or Sky tigers. They can either target first place or shoot back, but what it does is spread a ton of bees that blocks or hits 1st player. BUT, if you're really good at the game, you can drift and slide your way out of the hazard or any item.Being more specific, the game introduces Boats and planes. Boat, for example, is almost like karts, but you use the water at your advantage. You're able to do stunts when falling off a cliff or bouncing out of the waves to gain an incredible amount of speed. In my opinion, boat and kart are very similar. On the other hand, a player can also use a plane where it opens creatively for the player. There are almost no restrictions and you can fly how you want. All three, the player is able to drift, stunt, and preform a variety of skills to gain speed. What makes the game play different from other kart racing games is that the game rewards you for taking risks, which pushes you to try your best and learn how to go faster. If you try to avoid crashes and hazards uses boosts, you get a risk boost or stunt boosts. This gives a player new idea to get better at the game. What I love the most is that there is no ""best"" path or road. Majority of the paths in maps are balanced and you could take any path you want and still win. It all depends on your skills.In addition to all this crazy talk about drifting, stunts, and skills, Transformed's maps are some of the best kart racing maps. Rather than looping around the same track three times, the maps actually change as you progress. While the graphic or textures on the maps aren't that great compare to today's graphics, the map's environment is where it shines. If you notice that majority of the maps have some kind of action going on. Even maps that have the same track such as Carrier zone something happen such as planes flying back and forth while there explosions happening. AND, a huge missiles flies up to the sky. It just looks amazing. There even maps where the track changes entirely. There a map where you're just racing and if you look in the sky, there actually a battle happening, at the same time. In your second lap, the plane crashes and the players racing are force to use the water to continue the race. Just as you reach your final lap, a dragon destroys the track and you have to take plane. It sounds insane, right? Some of these maps, you actually feel like you're playing the actual SEGA game where it came from especially if you played the game such as Nights Into Dream's Dream Valley map. These are seriously some of the most creative unique maps I've ever played on.With great maps comes segantic (fantastic) music! This game offers a variety of abandon songs from Sonic games like You can Do Anything to obscure songs like Carrier Zone to remastered remixes from very old SEGA titles such as Space Harrier. If grew up playing SEGA games, this game will satisfy all your music needs and you'll remember all those valuable moments you had playing your old SEGA games. It does not matter if you played a SEGA game, you'll be nodding your head to the tunes. Some of these songs are addicting such as Race of Ages, Carrier Zone, or Amigo's Spanish song. What I love about these songs is that they improve the game play significantly as they make the game play more suspenseful, intense and climactic. For example, I've played with players who are WAY better than me, but what I was impressed was the fact that I did not care about 1st place. I just wanted to beat the person that was preventing me from getting the closest place. There moments when I was battling against a player trying to keep a place and I eventually beat the person, but laugh when I realized that I was fighting for 4th place. I simply did not care about getting 1st place, it was all about having fun and trying to beat your friends or rivals. I've seriously had some of the best intense moments in this game that no other game can offer. It's like being a driver of the ending of a Fast and Furious movie where it all comes to your skills. What really impressive me is the fact that many players seem to enjoy the game's contribution to old SEGA titles that went and bought old SEGA titles they loved from Transformed. SUMO Digital or SOL did a wonderful job showing their love for their SEGA best classics. You can tell a ton of love, and effort when building this game.Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed should be on history for separating kart racing games from Mario Kart Clones and try something entirely different. Now, there causal racing and competitive racing.			",176,33,6,21,14,2,17

												In a time of despair, betrayal and greed within the video game industry, a holy beacon of light appeared out of nowhere, summoned by SEGA.This light was called Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, a game built upon skill, experience and nimbleness. Following the template of ´95 games, this game is the proof of gaming culture reborn. With fantastic music, levels with incredible contrast, and gameplay so amazingly well built, you would be missing out one of the greatest and most fun multiplayer port one could think of. For your own sake, and the sake of realising that high quality games still exists, you need this game more than you think. This game is seriously good. Ever play Mario Kart, Diddy Kong Racing, or Burnout? Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed basically combines all of the good elements of these games, and does a great job of having characters you actually want to see from both in the Sega universe and not in the Sega universe.Most of the item weapons are counterable, INCLUDING the 1st place screw you item: THE BEES THE BEEEESS. I think everyone has a deep loathing of Mario Karts Blue Shell aka “bend over and prepare your♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or get into 2nd place for 90% of the race dammit. I am giving the Hot Rod item the screw you award though, it can be extremely cheap. The transform theme also bleeds into the tracks. The tracks actually change shape and even switch up when you transform, and it does it in very creative ways. For example, the one track gets blown to bits by an invading force, making you transform to plane for the last lap. This game easily ranks up there as one of the best goofy kart racers of all time! I mean, really, when this game has Team Fortress 2 characters and Wreck-It Ralph as kart racer options, how can you hate this game? HOW?!			",1666,682,61,226,179,19,307

												I honestly can't think of any flaw in this game. It sets out to do something and does it perfectly. The graphics are great, the handling is great and track desgin is great. It's just so colorful and bright that it's simply pure joy to play. My only regret is the fact that i'm not too familiar with characters and especially track locations. I know most of the Sonic ones and the Skies of Arcadia one is pure pefection, but some i don't recognize. It offers wide range of chalenges and difficulties for all types of gamers and runs smooth like butter on my piece of crap PC.Definitelly THE kart racer on Steam, I recommend it to anyone who's looking to have some fun.

												Fantastic kart/arcade racer! I bought it on a whim during the Steam Summer Sale and almost immediately became hooked. The way the courses evolve and incorporate the 3 different vehicle types blew my mind the first time I played each, and the controls and gameplay are top-notch in my opinion. Beyond that, having put in 300+ hours, I still have so much to learn to maximize my speed on each track - all the tricks and techniques one can employ to maximize boosts is incredible! On top of all that, there is still an active community for this game that, while not the largest, has been so amazingly helpful and friendly! Only downside is that one does tend to experience a number of network error disconnections while playing online, but usually one can just rejoin the lobby for the next race by simply restarting the game and entering the lobby again.Tl;dr: If you enjoy kart/arcade racers at all, I highly recommend this game!

												I've played this game with a couple of friends a bunch over the last couple of days, and have played a ton of it on a different console, and I can simply say that this might be the best Kart Racer ever made. It takes everything good about Mario Kart, gives you more ways to increase your speed based on your skill, and has many different ways to play any character allowing you to play with anyone you like and have your optimal stats.The course design, give or take a level or two, is always on the point. There's nothing more satisfying than learning a course and being able to flip and drift constantly. The ways the courses are laid out and change really allows you to visually tell how much better you're getting at playing, and it's always a nice feeling.The graphics of the game also manage to shine quite well. With a well optimized engine allowing for nearly anyone to play, it's almost a surprise how good this game manages to look. The small details in everything from the Casino Park level to the Jet Set Radio level pop out quite nicely, and manage to look good even at top speeds.The gameplay of the game is fun, simply put. I really can't think of another way to put it. The items are fun to launch at your friends or enemies, and they can all be avoided with other items or skill. If you dislike Mario Kart simply because of the blue shell, this might be your game. All three of the vehicle types are also perfectly balanced, and feel great to play with. It's just fun watching your car swiftly turn into a plane and then continue flying against your opponents. If you're looking for a game to sit around and play with a bunch of friends online, I would highly recommend this one. It just never gets old.			",188,14,9,22,14,3,35

												First off I want to say that I am not a Sonic fan nor really of racing games, yet I loved this game.This game reminds me of Mario Kart, it has alot of elements which need to be mentioned:The level design is great and very creative which also keeps the game from getting dull.Bots have great difficulty adjustments, you will have to work up your skill and learn the game before you can win against the harder AI.The graphics is clear and beautiful with a high definition cartoony smoothed out look, which runs smooth, and should run even on low end machines.The vehicle handling in this game is incredible feels like a real arcade gameFairly balanced customizable characters to choose from heaps from which you will recognise, each having their own vehicle look and transformation which is a nice touch.COOP CAMPAIGN (This is something I haven't seen done much, and it is one of the features which I had the most fun and makes this game stand out from other games in general). The campaign itself is very creative with having modes I have never seen doen before like 'Traffic Attack' (reaching checkpoints dodging traffic) 'Drift mode' (drift on marks on the ground that give you extra time to reach the end) 'Versus' (Go head to head against waves of bots and take them out or get ahead of them before they take you out)  'Boost challenge' (drive over the boost marks on the ground to reach the end before time runs out). So many more.. But what makes this better is that you can do all this with your friends together and unlock new maps and characters which keeps you locked in the game trying to beat bosses and progress through the campaign.The transformation with the kart, to boat, to air vehicle works great and just makes the game more original.A game you should definately play split screen with friends and one you can challenge yourself to reach your All Star potential. 9/10			",240,30,14,11,14,5,13

												Likely the best kart racer on PC. Sonic Racing Transformed's gimmick, the changing tracks & vehicle transformations is well executed, with each of the 3 vehicle types (car, boat, plane) feeling different, although the water driving feels a bit iffy. The tracks themselves are also generally very well made, with all of them very closing resembling the stages from the games they take inspiration from.The game also has a pretty good roster of characters from the sega stable, including   characters from sonic, Jet Set Radio, Skyes of Arcadia, and even PC exclusives like Football Manager and Heavy/Pyro/Spy from TF2, and while not that different from eachother, they still have small differences.Lastly, perfomance wise, it's one of the better ports I've seen. PC's from 2008 will run this game just fine @ 60FPS or nearly that with most eyecandy on max.			",869,262,44,129,81,10,133

												Am not the best at racing games but this game is sweet. It has a lot of cool, cute and fun characters to play as and a lot of racing maps. I like the graphics, the effects and how friendly it looks but do not be fooled because once the race starts it is WAR. The other races will do what it takes to win which makes it a lot of fun and this is not a typical racing game because some maps you also fly or are on water. This game takes the experience to another level when you play it beside friends! I would recommend this game if it goes on sale but do not pay full price for it.			",1035,432,37,88,124,11,111

												Absoultely amazing, completely addictive kart racing game that blows Mario Kart out of the water. The Steam version of Sonic and All-Stars racing Transformed is the best one by far, just for being able to run at 60 FPS if you computer can support it. Seriously, it just looks so much faster and feels so much better than the console versions. Gameplay modes include the amazing World Tour, where you take on various missions and collect stars to unlock more characters and modifications for their vehicles. Grand Prix, your standard Mario Kart style mode where you compete in a series of races and try to get more points than the other guys. Time Attack, where you attempt to get the fastest lap on a track. The game also has online matchmaking in the form of standard races, Arena where you can compete in the game's 3 arena modes: Battle Race (like a regular race, but you are knocked out after taking 3 hits), Battle Arena (takes place on special combat-based maps and try to shoot the other guys and stuff), and Capture the Chao (find a Chao and deliver it to its destination, while others try to bump into you and steal it), and Lucky Dip, which is a mix of the two modes and also includes Boost Race (tracks have more boost pads, but no items will spawn). Online is fairly populated in the Race lobby, but seems to be sort of dead on Arena and Lucky Dip. A word of warning: Make SURE you at least play through World Tour before going online! There are plenty of VERY skilled players online, and you'll want a decent grasp of the tracks and the controls before taking them on. Thankfully, the community is one of the best i've seen in any online game; I've nearly doubled my Steam friend list just from playing this! The top players have written plenty of guides for this game if you're having trouble; be sure to check them out.Unfortunately, since this game uses the same peer-to-peer networking as the console versions, lag can rear its ugly head. Its two major manifestations take the form of collisions that send your car flying, and several-second pauses that can throw you off guard. It doesn't happen every race, but it can show up, so be prepared.Overall, just a great game, never thought I'd put so many hours into this, but I just can't stop! VERY recommended purchase!

												When this game came free to play for the weekend, I gave it a try, I've enjoyed all the sonic games for the Game boy consoles and thought that I should give this game ago, when I stalled it I was amazed with the graphics in the game; not the best but I think they awesome for the type of game, which brings a lot of visual towards the amount of fun you can have in the game.It's not just racing in your kart, you get vehicle transformation, kart (Land) Boat (Water) Plane (Air) all character will have different vehicles and looks which makes the game more fun.You'll say to your self, I'll do one game on Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed and you'll end up on it for hours.I would also recommend using a controller for this game as you can get a lot more fun out of it... (depends on your gaming style)100% worth buying this game! ",194,33,11,19,31,4,34

												Why have we not seen a sequal from SEGA yet, it's easily just as good as Mario Kart, probably better for being a much more balanced Kart Racer.Come on SEGA, shut up and take my money, you actually deserve it, I wish I could give you more.9.5/10 Not Perfect, but this games addiction level is over 9000.

There is a huge selection of game modes and a variety of characters, not to mention the unforgettable music.

												When most people simply glanced at the game, it is easy to look at it as just another mascot kart racing game.  With character racers like Crash Team Racing, LittleBigPlanet Karting, and especially Mario Kart, one would think that that there is nothing more to do.  However, by taking a closer look, it becomes clear that there is more than meets the eye.While the various characters will get your attention, the vehicles that they drive are the important detail.  Depending on the track, the drivers will use either the classic go-kart, a speedboat, or a fighter jet.  Using various vehicles was used in other games like Diddy Kong Racing, but Transformed taking it a step further.  In most cases, the tracks consist of multiple terrains.  Mario Kart has changing terrains, but your kart does not change with it.  If you go into the water, you end up driving in the water, but it is still in kart form.  If you go into the air, a hang glider comes out to extend your jump, but it still counts as more ground racing instead of real aerial races.  In this game, when going from one terrain to another, the vehicles will change accordingly to match it.  That means if your kart goes into the water, the kart will change into a speedboat.  If you hit a big ramp, it will now become a fighter jet.  With your vehicle changing throughout the race, it makes the vehicles more interesting than usual.The vehicles are not the only thing that transforms in this game.  As you race progresses, the tracks will change along with it, a feature few racers ever did.  In one prime example, Dragon Canyon, each lap has its own feel.  In lap one, you will start by driving along wooden bridges and rock roads.  Partially into lap two, a giant rock will block the road forcing the racers onto an unstable water route with waves, rocks, and waterfalls.  On the final lap, a dragon will blow up the wooden bridge making everybody to take to the skies dodging pillars and monsters.  With an ever-changing track layout, it makes repeating the same track a lot more exciting than other racing games.As with most kart racers, items are a part of the action.  While these weapons make the racing more interesting, they tend to make things unfair.  This is something that this game fixes.  One of these is a weapon that locks onto a racer and seeks it until it makes contact.  In most games, once somebody launches this weapon, all you can do is take the hit.  In here, when the game warns you, it is possible to dodge it with a well-timed boost.  Additionally, another item will allow you go grab them weapon and, if desired, send it back to them.  One more detail about them items is how they are against the leader.  In these games, there is usually a weapon designed to attack specifically the leader.  What makes them bad is that because they are guaranteed to hit the leader regardless of their distance.  This makes it that the game will penalized the leader simply for being in the lead.  Transformed realized this is unfair and fixes it.  With this game, to attack the leader, the weapon used is a swarm of bees.  While they will hurt the leader if they hit, that is not a guarantee.  They work by acting as a series of pillars.  Through skillful driving, it is possible to drive around them unharmed.  By making it that lead targeting item works on skill instead of blind targeting, this makes that if the leader can avoid them, then that person deserves to be in the lead, the way that it should be.Another thing that makes the game stand out are the modes available.  Like any racing them, Grand Prix racing is the main draw of the game.  However, another mode stands out in this game.  In World Tour mode, the game gives various challenges besides simply winning a race.  One on track, dozens of cars will crowd the track making it hard to maneuver.  On another, a tank will try to blast you.  On yet another, the player need to fly through rings that send them both on and off the regular course.  With so much variety, this could have been a game onto itself.  With all the extra challenges, most other racing games pale in comparison.Even though the newest Mario Kart game is about a year newer, this is what it should have been.  Even for those that play on Nintendo systems, this is the superior kart racer to play.  Since this is a multiplatform game, fans of the genre should not miss on one of the best games released in years.			",2671,1105,99,291,293,32,439

												I have never been a fan of any type of racing game, but Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed has kept me playing somehow! Commonly referred to as ""Sonic Kart"", Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed carries on the mantle of SEGA's racing franchises, coming after titles such as Outrun and Daytona USA. It features a lot of the characters and locales from alot of SEGA's major and not-so-major franchises (I'm looking at you, Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg!).""What does the Transformed in the title mean?"", you might be wondering. To put it simply, each racer's car can transform between a car, boat, and a plane! This makes for some interesting track designs, as portions of each track are land, water, and air-based, and transition between each other very smoothly. It's exciting watching your car morph into a boat or plane without losing any momentum! Sadly, the water segments are the weakest points, as you do not have the traction of the track, and waves don't seem to have any impact on your boat at all. The plane is easily the most fun segment, with the car segments coming second. A major mechanic in the game is ""Drifting"", in which you brake and turn to the side around curves, which after awhile will earn you a boost when you come out of drifting. Using this to your advantage is key to keeping up with your opponents and winning races!With over 20 tracks (40 if you count the mirrored tracks), there is never a dull moment. Tracks also morph and terraform between laps, offering a different experience per lap, and chaning up the land/air/water segments as you go. Tracks range from your typical Sonic locales (Casino Palace, Seaside), to a Panzer Dragoon track, Super Monkey Ball, and Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg. Each track is unique, and they all change as the race progresses.There are many, many characters available to unlock, all representing the franchise they come from. Of course, you have your obvious characters...Sonic the Hedgehog, Knuckles the Echidna, Tails, and Metal Sonic. But there are also characters such as Wreck-It-Ralph, Beat from Jet Set Radio, MiMi from Super Monkey Ball, Vyse from Skies of Arcadia, Ulala from Space Channel 5, and many more. Exclusive to the Steam version are also the Tactician from Football Manager, the Deadly Assassin from Total War: Shogun, and Heavy/Spy/Pyro from Team Fortress 2. Each one levels up, gaining more ""car mods"" with which you can customize the performance of your vehicle. Your car has a few stats on which it is graded, which can be adjusted with your unlocked mods: Speed, Handling, Acceleration, Boost, and All-Star. All-Star is a special ability unique to each character that can be activated by collecting the appropriate power-up. For example, Knuckles' All-Star ability allows him to use the Master Emerald to conjure a Chaos Blast-like explosion.There are a number of power-ups that can be used, each obtained from a Random Item pickup. Once picked up, a very fast roulette will determine what power-up you receive. This is completely random, and is also the only way to get the All-Star power-up. Examples of some power-ups are Snow (allows you to throw up to 3 snowballs at opponents), Boost (gives you a free, trigger-at-will boost), Fireworks (similar to Snow, but fires a Firework that bounces between walls), and Blowfish (drops a blowfish on the track which stops any racers who hits it momentarily). If you hit an opponent with a power-up like Snow or Firework, they will drop a Coin. These are collected and used to play a slots game before each race, at the cost of 5 Coins per pull. You can obtain a random power-up at the very start of the race in this manner.There are several games modes, including World Tour, Time Trial, Single Race, and Grand Prix. In addition to this, there is a multiplayer that utilizes Steam Matchmaking, so your are never too far from competition!As I said at the beginning of this review, I am not a fan of racing games. But Sonic & All Stars Racing Transformed has made me change my mind about racers. They can be pretty awesome when done right, and this game definitely does it right. It's fun, vibrant, and never short on thrills, challenges, or variety. Do check this game out if you haven't already, you'll be glad you did.

												Having played several Mario Kart games, I must admit that I enjoy the variety offered by this Sega alternative.  Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed offers customizable vehicles, three different vehicle modes for different terrains, and a large variety of racing modes.  The solo campaign features the expected World Tour, Grand Prix, and Time Attack modes.  Grand Prix and Time Attack are no different than a Mario Kart game, but World Tour has much variety. (Note, the last Mario Kart I played was Mario Kart Wii, so it is possible Mario Kart has since started offering this variety as well.)All-Star Racing Transformed offers several different types of game modes in the World Tour campaign:* Standard Race - 3 laps, use weapons to attack other racers* Battle Race - at most 3 laps, use weapons to attack other racers, 3 hits eliminates a racer* Boost Race - 3 laps, no weapons, lots of boost pads* Boost Challenge - Race through a number of checkpoints before time runs out, time only counts down when you are NOT boosting* Ring Challenge - Fly through a ring course before time runs out* Traffic Attack - dodge through cars to reach checkpoints before time runs out* Drift Challenge - drift through checkpoints along a set path, time only increases when you drift correctly* Versus - 1v1 race, stay in the lead for a set amount of time or get far enough ahead to eliminate the opponent* Sprint - solo race, beat the lap time of a ghost* Pursuit - attack a massive tank that stays in front of you, dodge the tank's attacks, kill it before it kills youMultiplayer retains only the Race, Battle Race, and Boost Race game modes, but it also offers two additional modes exclusive to multiplayer games:* Battle Arena - drive around on a small open map using weapons to attack opponents, 3 hits eliminates a player* Capture the Chao - pick up a Chao creature and bring it to a dropoff area to score, attacking the player with the Chao will cause the Chao to drop and another player can pick it upLiving up to the title, race cars will transform on different levels to account for changes in the course.  Levels feature a mixture of land, sea, and air racing, so you may find yourself driving a car, boat, or plane as you race to the finish.  If cars transforming wasn't enough, the race tracks will also change between laps, so you may find yourself flying in lap 3 even though you used a boat in laps 1 and 2.In addition to the transformations, each driver also has several mods you can apply to the vehicle.  Mods are unlocked by leveling up a driver.  Drivers earn experience for each event they complete regardless of whether or not you win or lose, though you do get much more experience for winning.  The mods may affect each driver's vehicle differently, but in general they take a point away from one category and add it to a different category.  The mods are:* Standard - default stats* Balanced - usually takes a point off the highest stat and gives it to the lowest stat* Handling - takes a point off Speed and adds it to Handling* Acceleration - takes a point off Boost and adds it to Acceleration* Speed - takes a point off Handling and adds it to Speed* Boost - takes a point off Acceleration and adds it to Boost* Console Mod - generally maxes out Speed and/or Boost at the expense of other stats (this mod must be unlocked in the World Tour campaign rather than by leveling up)But how does the game actually play? Is it fun?Short answer: YES!Long answer:It will take you a bit of time to get used to this game.  There are several tricks you'll need to learn to help you race faster, such as knowing how to get the starting boost and when to perform aerial acrobatics, but you will quickly get the hang of things.  The car is by far the easiest vehicle mode to control.  The boat and plane take a bit of getting used to, but none are terribly frustrating after a bit of practice.  There are also plenty of characters with different stats, so you'll certainly be able to find something that suits your play style.  (In fact, there's more than enough characters, many of which you will likely never use.)I enjoyed playing my way through the campaign.  The difficulty curve increased at about the same rate as my skill, so the levels got harder as I got better.  There were a handful of tracks I had to play several times, but for the most part I was able to complete each level in 4 tries or less.Multiplayer is where this game really shines, assuming you have friends to play with.  The game supports 4 player local play and up to 10 players online, which can be a mix of local and network.  The silliness and chaos of casual races with friends is great, but there is also a small competitive community if you're into that instead.One point of complaint is that the game artificially increases the game time by trapping you in non-skippable menus after each race.  It takes 35 seconds to restart a level after you fail, 55 if you want to change characters or difficulty.  You will certainly be button mashing that :XBA: button to get through these screens as fast as possible, but this still amounts to over an hour of your life wasted in menus if you play through the campaign.Another point of complaint is that the ability to fully customize races is missing.  I'd like the ability to specify which weapons are available, or change the rules of the race.  Maybe put on low gravity, faster cars, or some other crazy mix of custom rules.My Game Completion info:I beat all World Tour levels on Hard difficulty.  This unlocked a 6th cup and Expert mode.  I then beat all the levels in the 6th cup on Hard except the last level (which requires you to beat the entire game on Expert in order to unlock. No thanks!  I've had enough of this game artificially increasing game time.)I also beat the first 5 Grand Prix cups on Hard difficulty.  This unlocks another 5 Grand Prix cups in mirror mode (which I ignored).

												Whether navigating the labyrinthine hallways of Curien’s Mansion or dodging the reptilian occupants of Death Adder’s Lair, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is the right kind of trip down memory lane. A superior Mario Kart clone and certainly the best Sega has ever produced, especially in terms of the teary-eyed nostalgia inspired by its endless retro cameos.Amazingly beautiful tracks where you race, swim and fly, sometimes changing the level as you progress through it, are what makes this game great.Nostalgia aside, Sonic Transformed as a kart racing game is a blast to play and it comes highly recommended, especially at the reasonable Steam price.

												Admittedly, an oddball in my Steam game library, one filled with gory shooters, slaughterfests, and other such M-rated material, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is like the stray hippie amongst a population consisting of shizophrenic sociopaths! If you don't like long reviews, just skip to the last paragraph, where I summarize everything!I quite honestly don't remember just how exactly this game ended up in my library, but I recently decided to play it anyway.  Because while I may have many games I still need to play out of my library, I've been desiring a decent racing game for quite some time. Did I expect this game to actually fulfill that desire by being anything close to what could be considered a quality racing game that brought me some great amount of entertainment? Honestly, no, I did not.But alas, I was surprised! What I expected to be nothing more than a dumbed down racing experience with unbalanced items and cheesy banter between characters that would make me want to turn this into one of those M-rated shooters I own so that I may claim unsavory vengeance upon them for their horrible forced personalities, turned out to actually be one of the few good racing games I've seen on Steam!How is it good? Well, allow me to explain! Wait... Oh, right, that's what reviews are about... Um... Moving on!From the screenshots, and the involvement of Sonic and co, in a bright and cheerful-looking environment, one may be brought to the understandable conclusion that this game would only be enjoyable if you were young, or the stereotypical ""hardcore"" 50-year old Sonic Fan with no friends, who yells ""You're too slow!"" at every car he drives by on his way to his minimum wage job at the local McDonald's. You would be wrong.Amazingly enough, this game is actually enjoyable regardless of age, and you really don't have to be a fan of Sonic at all to enjoy the gameplay. I'd recommend this game regardless of the age of the player, as it's obviously safe for young kids to play, but definitely offers an enjoyable experience for older players as well (For reference, I'm almost 19).Is it for the ""filthy casuals""? No, not at all! While a casual could definitely get into the game on the lower difficulties that take nearly no skill whatsoever, a pro gamer could easily find a good challenge on the hard, and expert difficulties!My only complaint would be how few tracks there are. A total of 16 new tracks, with an additional 4 classic tracks, plus mirrored versions of all the tracks, and +1 new track with a mirrored version if you get the DLC. Thankfully, the game offers a variety of modes to make this small number of tracks less bothersome. Nonetheless, it is a small amount, and new DLCs with additional tracks are unlikely.Speaking of the DLC, it's not bad, but I certainly wish it offered more than just one single new track. A full circuit of four new tracks would certainly be more appealing. The DLC track isn't really worth it in all honesty, since it's not nearly as interesting as the tracks originally in the game, and there's also a few bugs in it that can be accidentally triggered from time to time (nothing too frequent, so don't worry). Buy it if you really want a new character, and desperately want an extra track. Otherwise, skip it.So, in summary, a great game for all ages (children or adults), and offers a challenge for both casuals and hardcore gamers, providing a small number of tracks, but a fair number of characters, and overall one of the few good racing games on Steam right now.

												Review, Tips, GuideWhere do I start with how awesome and addictive this game is? Somehow I managed to clock in over 620 hours playing this, still crave every second of it!Being a late starter and only getting the game at the start of 2014 when a friend was kind enough to give it to me as a gift while trying to promote Ryo Hazuki DLC and Shenmue.I did not have high expectations for the game after playing the horrible touch screen version you can download on mobile... this dampened my expectations as to what to expect on the PC and console addition of SSASRT.First mode I tried was the online match-making. Never in my life have I felt like such a novice at a kart racing game, there really is a polarising effect between being good and being down right elitist when it comes to online MM. This did not stop me from playing. I was fascinated, intrigued of how these top players became so awesome at this kart racer and quickly learnt that SSASRT is a rather technical Kart racing game.Those new to the SSASRT: you need to learn fundamental basics.Learn how to drift to level 3Find out how to risk boost and danger boostLearn the tracks as best as you canLearn how to stack your boostsLearn every item and use them effectivelyLearn how to avoid drones with a driftUnlock practice with all characters find their strengths and weaknessesCheck your mini-map on straight ways for approaching racers and on incoming item spam, back spam if needed to counter this and look backward to see the potential racer.Constantly if ever in bad situation go all-star strategy.Above all else do not hit walls and practice and maintain high speed and keep consistent racesWondering how I got so good at this game: I came up with a plan!Decided to complete career mode and gain all (232 stars) and complete all Grand Prix and mirror tracks set out to unlock all characters and their respective console mods. I thought this would give me the edge I needed but I was in for a surprise... Gaining all the all-stars in career mod was tougher than expected but at the same time it was the most rewarding. And whatever you gained in career mode without knowing ...you will be applying in online MM.Sumo Digital have gone to a lot of effort at getting the balance between casually playing this Kart Racer and challenging the player to get better while also gaining rewards after completing and getting all 232 stars. And gaining a new character ""Ages"" was funny enough (this spells Sega backwards).I was feeling confident with my new attained super kart racing skills after completing the game, getting all 232 stars and completing Grand Prix on expert mode; I was sure I was in with a chance to take on even the top players on MM, come out on top or at least give them a good run for their money. I found myself accelerating up the ranks and obtaining & keeping a constant and respectful 1600 rank in MM. I new it was time to take on higher ranked players and test my skills.. Again I was in for surprise, feeling frustrated with my efforts and felt I had peaked only obtaining 1600 to 1700 ranks while I greatly desired to achieve a 2000 rank.To do this I had to better my playing style to compete with higher ranks. I pushed on and came up with another plan, which was only something you could gain through experience and patience and allot of hours playing. I set out to learn all the yellow pick-up locations, what they had to offer and tap into their potential and also learned which mods and characters worked best for each track.On some tracks this was a huge game changer: for example there are two yellow pick-ups on Graffiti City: the first pick-up is a triple boost; used at the right time you can gain tremendous speed on straight runs, however this is not always enough to win this track consistently due to the tight nature of the course and the ""bees"" on the second lap. Now, this is where the second yellow pick-up comes in handy, which is a (blue glove). I like to use this when the ""Bees"" come my/your way... activate it and sail through them, the bees also act like a wall and are slowing down other racers who might be fast approaching.This strategy gave me huge advantage over players, and from time to time I have been accused of cheating on Grafity City. Well, once you get to grips with the course it's possible to pick both yellow pick-ups and use the triple boost and pick-up the blue glove which will both give your even more distance, when timed and use correctly. Sometimes you might find yourself in challenging situations with regular players who see you as their rival, and you might end up getting a few friend requests.:)) This is something not many articles mention or people talk about...It  is the online social communtiy linked with that game which I think people really need to start taking notes of because I think this is also a factor that makes this game a great success...it is the community that goes with it..SSASRT has an active racing community and friendly too, and sometimes it causes and creates rivalries in MM, especially with the Brazil players and Europeans.One veteran SSASRT racer who goes by the alias of ""harlot"" decided to add me as a friend back in july, he was quick to message me about my skills limitations at that time and style... others have taken note of my potential and this gave me more confidence to keep on going and to continue racing SSASRT. I can't remember exactly what was said back then, but we soon became good rivals to one another, we both had a common goal to improve our racing style and to win as much as we can. But we had different ways of going about it. harlot said to me: If I want to really improve my game I need to ""time attack"", I took note of what he said and I managed to unlock all the secrets the tracks had to offer, if it wasn't for harlot's insight. It would be almost impossible for me to keep up with the elitist at MM....there is so much to learn to be at the top of your game while playing SSASRT...The game has unlimited potential in that regard!HARLOT QUOTE: I can, at this moment, be a better matchmaker in a week, than you can be a time attacker in the same amount of timeEven though I had the Time Attack experience it did not always solve crucial problems and differences between MM and TA, that is because in MM you can pick up items and if you get hit it it slows you down… because TA promotes the use of ""Console Mods"", but at times this is not always suitable for MM and so, I decided to approach this differently.This is what I come up with to address this issue:I have a character for every track in the game, I developed a strategy that will give me the overall edge to that particular track and the best balance depending on some factors, that I take into account.I am very specific about this, learned over time certain methods and race conditions that need a particular fine tuning, which can greatly improve your chances. This is where the true sophistication that SSASRT brings.These are a few examples what character's I use for some of the tracks in SSASRT and the mod's I use and the yellow items I like to pick-up.Race of Ages - Ryo Hazuki - Console mod - Provides the perfect balance of movement speed - especially in water areas and being small enough to avoid going over the edge of the track.Game changer: Triple Boost yellow pick-up second lap just passed the finish line. Chilly Castle - AIAI - Sonic - Manager - (Ryo Hazuki/ Console mod) - best over all mod for this track ""Acceleration"".Game Changer: You will need to know this course inside and out, learn TA acceleration mod and track knowledge and above all maintaining lead will see you beat this track on MM.Dream valley - Ages / Ryo Hazuki / Gilleus / - Console modGame Changer: Learn how to (Risk-boost) on practically anything and stack your boosts as best you can.

												This is the best Mario Kart clone currently on the market, but it does have some positive points over even Mario Kart...- The tracks are so varied, with some really good tracks included.- Content, the game has so many characters to unlock, kart mods, tracks, & a long campaign that get's pretty tricky near the end.- The campaign is 2 player.- The AI doesn't cheat, if you're spanking them, you're spanking them. They don't magically get the equivilant to 3 blue shells in a row & take you out on the last 2 corners, despite dominating the entire race.- The difficulty is fair & has a nice upward slope, meaning you get better at the game as it gets harder, nothing ever seems too hard, unless you jump straight in for the 3 star missions despite never playing before.- The music and graphics may not stand out as much as Mario Kart, but they do stand on their own merits.It's not all positive though, the game does have some bad points;- Character selection, quite a few are pretty bland & won't be used unless you're aiming for 100%. I mean I love the Football Manager series, but I have no interest in driving as some generic manager just because SEGA publish the franchise.- Shadow's in it.- Some of the 3 star missions will do your head in, but again, this isn't the game being unfair, it just means you're not driving well enough.- A few of the tracks are forgetable.8/10Best kart racer on Steam, if you need a Mario Kart-esque racer in your library, this is by far the best choice.

I really hope that SEGA gets a developer or the same developers to make a third game. Hey SEGA, remember you said that you want the comsumers trust back, well get on track to making a third sonic racing game like this, that will help a little.			",59,7,3,10,1,0,0

												This is my favorite racing game on Steam. Its similar to new versions of Mario Kart, but I like the feel of this better. It has the typical things like character selection, map selection, power ups, and turbo speed strips to drive over. It includes land, water, and air racing. Some of the maps have all three in one race. The acheivements are fun to get, and some are actually pretty challenging. I like the feel of this one much more than the first. I definitely recommend using a controller for this game, as it makes it much easier. It has online play too, so its fun to race friends. Drifting is a very important thing in this game, so if you're losing a lot, try to drift more around turns. I recommend this to to anyone whos looking for a racing game, a casual game to just play a little bit of once in a while,  something to play with friends, or a fan of Mario Kart or CTR Crash Team Racing.

												This game is quite impressive and original.Other than Mario Kart, it's been more than 15 years that I haven't seen such game being fun and competitive at the same time.The graphics are good, the different maps will give you some nostalgic feelings, every transformation is smooth to drive with.The online multiplayer is a little laggy and in some maps, there isn't really a technique of driving you can use to win, it all depends of the items and that's quite bad. However, the local multiplayer up to 4 players is really fun, no lag and team with your friends to be on the podium.Also, the game itself is quite easy, there's 4 different levels (Easy to Expert) and you can end them without any problem. The ghost times will maybe give you some challenge, unless you unlocked the last car and fully upgraded it.- Finally, it's an awesome game, really enjoyable in solo. Buy it now!

												This game is very similar to Crash Team Racing and Muppet RaceMania from PlayStation (I only played those two). Concept is same - you race with other characters, using powerups to help you on the way. There's no pure racing, you have to learn to drift properly and do stunts while in air to earn short speed boosts and also trying to sabotage other players, which is not always easy to do but can help greatly in determining the winner. There're plenty of tracks and several racing mods so it's hard to get boring.Although you can finish this game in any difficulty you want, playing on highest difficulty is a real treat. There's pure adrenaline rush, trying to finish first without making errors (especially in ""beat the ghost"" mod). Multiplayer is still active (as of this date), you won't have problems finding others to play with. Some achievements are really hard to get so this is not easy 100%.Overall, great racing experience, great game, you won't be disappointed.			",116,53,10,3,2,1,8

												Rating 9.5/10Overview: Arcade kart RacerThe Good:+ 20 levels that span across different parts of the Sega universe. All the levels are detailed, well designed and incredibly fun to play. What really makes the levels is that they feel so alive, whether its air ships battling in the skies, pieces of the track blowing up, carriers jets flying over head, or flying through exotic envirnoments it all adds to the atmoshpere. + The majority of the levels change inbetween laps keeping things unique and interesting. There are three modes of racing: car, boat and plane.  One lap you may be driving a car and the next lap you may be flying a plane, sometimes you switch between the modes in a single lap. +Plenty of characters each with their own stats. As you play with a certain racer you unlock mods that change their stats for better performance depending on the level/mode your playing. + The game features plenty of different modes across 4 difficulty levels. Each mode is fun to play and very creative. Some modes include racing, boost challenges, sprint, battle areans, traffic attack etc. The Average- I found the weapons you use to be somewhat average. I did not find them as unique or interesting as the levels. - Multiplayer is somewhat still alive but its pretty hard to get a good game going. ConclusionThis is one of the best arcade racers on Steam, if you can get some friends together you are sure to have a good time. They took everything that was great in the first game and improved upon it in significant way ",731,344,32,73,63,8,96

YouTube™ Video: Sonic & All Stars Racing Transformed - Just 15 Minutes 

			Views: 370		

			Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is a kart racing video game developed by Sumo Digital and published by Sega. It was released for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U in November 2012, for...		

Long time ago, Nintendo create their best Kart Race called Mario Kart. Althought the game shows aged the gameplay still now a days totally fantastic, and using that ""secret"" formula, Nintendo created more and more games of their sucessful franchise.But if you LOVE Mario Kart, like me, and don't have a Nintendo plataform, well, you certainlly was abandoned. Well, less so far, Sega copied that ""secret formula"" and I could said: Improved that formula... a lot!Think about a game made with respect,""love"" and care... Yes! Sega did it! And put all your legacy inside this game (almost all) like Sonic series, Golden axe, Samba de Amigo, Shenmue, Jet Set Radio, Afterburn, Skies of Arcadia, Crazy Taxi and much more... Pure nostalgic! The ""transformed mechanics"" add more variety. (Your machine tranformes to an Airplane, or a ship depending of the situation)Highlights:- Perfect Gameplay- feeling of speed- Itens are balanced and help you (and cause trouble too!) your controller skill are more important.- Diversty of game modes, tracks, chracters.- Graphically Awesome (and you don't need a powerful PC!)- Nostalgic music and places- 4 splitscreen gameplay and online modes.Really, this game have only Highlights. Play it and have fun!			",176,31,7,21,9,1,14

												Why would I not recommend this game?The gameplay is vastly different from the previous entry in the series. Transforming and drift boosting will give a great edge in this game once you master the latter. Risk boosting in plane mode can take some time to master since you have to roll out of the way at the last moment for it to count.The staff ghosts can be a real pain in some levels (looking at Graveyard Gig and Burning Rangers in particular since both are a little difficult to master drifting in).Cameo appearances from non-SEGA stuff (Danica Patrick, Ralph, and Yogscast if you choose to buy it) are nice to see. Interestingly, people seem to hold a lot of course record top 10 spots with Ralph with characters like Metal Sonic, Sonic, and AGES all coming pretty close to it.Quite a blast to race through the courses (although I think Mirror Mode could have been replaced with 4-8 new tracks instead, oh well, SUMO's call there) and try to beat your own record every time. I did find Traffic Attack (sans the last one) and Pursuit to be a difficult to master since those felt a tad bit more on the ""need to memorize a specific course of pattern"" kind of logic to me. Pursuit was way more difficult though since you have a set amount of HP so you can't just recklessly chase down the tank.The characters were great although a couple of them looked a bit off (looking at Gum, Beat, and Pudding). Dialogue and racing stuff was pretty nice. It seems Gillius is the hardest one to master as well out of all the characters.Fantastic game, whether it is in a deal on Steam or not, worth icking up and playing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Mario Kart looks kinda ridicilous after playing this game. However, as always playing in S Class [Expert Class], you'll have to confront to a very overpowered AI and sometimes you'll be dominating, and suddenly you see a random racer like Alex Kidd that drives at like 200% of his car performance. You will then lose the race and you will start insulting OP drivers about how their character conception annoys you like : ""Alex Kiddo, u lil' piece of trash!

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is the Mario Kart version for the PC. Or better yet, the old Diddy Kong Racing.Run in a different environments and with different vehicles (car, plane and boat) is very fun and every course and characters brings that old and good feeling to revive the golden hits of the Sega company. It's just to much fun to bring Alex Kidd in the Golden Axe course and the Get Set Radio challenging you for the first place.The race controls are pretty good, it's very similar to other games with this kart style, but in here you must learn how to drift to keep it up to the competition and earn some boost to make your way to the first place or to beat the time.The game modes are very nice, you can play only some races, go for tournaments or go on career mode to earn starts and then unlock more courses and characters.The power ups works the same way we are used to know in this style of game, and they add a good fun element. Some of them you can choose to throw ahead or leave to hit someone behind you.The sound design is great. Every music and sound effect make all the experience in the race unique and brings the memories of those games.The level design is awesome! It gives you the feel of movement and speed that is the heart of a race game and it is always changing! In some courses you will see all the landscape and the road being attacked and as the race goes you will change to other paths or even change completely your vehicle to a plane or boat to continue the race. And this is absolutely fantastic!If you are an orphan of Mario Kart or Diddy Kong Racing (which is better, sorry to say that...) you MUST try this one. It's a great and extremely fun race game.

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is a great game. No, I'm not kidding. This is better than a Sonic game deserves to be, hell, it's better than a SEGA game deserves to be. This is actually a real competitor for the Mario Kart franchise, and it's one of the better racing games you'll find on Steam. It's also probably the closest thing we'll ever get to having Mario Kart on Steam.Okay, so let's get it out of the way first because it's been said to death, and it's true: this game is basically a Mario Kart clone. It's very easy to see how the older game was translated into this. Sonic & All Stars Racing Transformed doesn't score high marks on originality. For instance, a lot of the pickups are basically just reskinned versions of the ones we know and love. Instead of green shells, there are snowballs. Instead of the red shell, there is an RC car. Instead of the mushroom, there are boosts. Instead of the mine, there's is a blowfish. Instead of the golden mushroom, there's the hot rod. Instead of the invincibility star, there's the ""All Star"" pickup. The racing gameplay is also based entirely around drifting. On top of that, there is the battle mode akin to the Mario Kart style. As said before, this game doesn't do much in the way of uniqueness, but it's the way everything coheres that makes it stand out.Okay, so let's talk about how this game isn't like Mario Kart. There are three important gameplay factors here: the first is that the game is based on three different kinds of vehicle types: car, boat, and plane. This creates quite a bit of variety in the playstyle and level layout, which tends to change from lap to lap. The other thing is that while yes, drifting between yellow, red, and blue sparks was a thing in Mario Kart, here the boosting is much more prevalent (a third-tier boost gives you much more boost than it would in Kart) and the pre-boost drifting seems to lower your speed more than in Kart, making it slightly more of a risk. The third aspect is that you now gain experience points for each character, unlocking different ""mods"" that alter various stats for the players. You start out with 16 or 18 already unlocked, and you can unlock another 10 or 12. Each character only uses his or her own cart but can unlock five or six mods, granting you about 180 different loadouts, possibly more.There are a few other things that this does differently than does Kart. For instance, the ground will frequently give you opportunities to do stunts, the correct implementation of which will give you boosts, which are essential to winning on the higher difficulties. There are also unique pickups: there's the rocket, which fires straight ahead and is essentially like a very hard green shell to aim. There's the glove, which lets you pick up any item thrown at you and lets you take it for yourself. There's the twister, which can spin an enemy around. And there's also the notorious SWARM OF BEES, which is the most random of the bunch, putting bees in the field. Mario Kart fans may be pleased or displeased to hear that there is no real equivalent of the blue shell in this game.Before talking about multiplayer, I do want to mention the single-player. Single-player is way more fun than it deserves to be. The career mode has multiple parts, including world tour and grand prix. World Tour seems like the main single-player ""campaign,"" and is intuitive, easy to understand, and has a lot of cool game modes, some of which unfortunately didn't make it into the multiplayer. Game modes such as Traffic Attack, where you have to avoid cars and go through certain zones to get time added to the clock, and Pursuit, where you collect ammo pickups to destroy a tank that's firing at you, are just great fun and add a new element that had been lacking in Kart since the beginning.Now, on to the multiplayer. The multiplayer is very fun. You can choose between five different kinds of racing styles: standard racing on four different difficulties, battle race (where each player has three lives and you try to kill the other players during a race), arena battle, capture the chao (which I admittedly hate), and boost race (which I admittedly love). It is unfortunately a bit clunky and time-consuming to get everything set up, as I will explain below. Thankfully they've mitigated some of the loading time with giving you a slot machine mini-game while the map is loading, which require five coins that you can only pick up on racing courses, which may yield a bonus. You can use any of the characters that you've unlocked plus any of their mods. You will also still receive EXP as usual. I should also mention that you can split-screen the game at any time. I've never tried this, but the game encourages this at every turn, so I guess if you're a split-screen fan, this is a game to consider. I should also comment on the look and feel of the maps. The maps are extremely well-detailed, bright, colorful, smooth, and pretty. The bright maps feel very nice and the dark maps don't feel drab or dreary, as appears to be the current trend that blights modern video games. The maps themselves are inspired by various SEGA games, like Super Monkey Ball or Space Channel 5, but none include actual map layouts from said games. The feel of the cars is pretty solid. The characters are sometimes a bit random but come from a variety of different classic games. For instance, there's a character named Pudding; do you know where a SEGA character named Pudding comes from? As you can imagine, there are more Sonic characters than any others, but you're never required to play as a Sonic character. Of course, I wish there would be more characters from random games (like Billy Hatcher, for instance, how cool would that be?), and this is one of those games that lets your imagination run wild with ideas. Of course, there are a few negatives. Probably the biggest is the first-time setup is a bit of a hassle. It sucks that you need to launch the game separately in Config mode and I've also heard that some people can only get it to open in compatibility mode. On top of that, it seems that they never fixed the sound. You need to turn the volume way down if you want to talk to people, but at the main title, the sound will revert back to its normal volume, which is all the way up. The game does hardly anything to explain to you how to use any of the controls, including drifting and what the items do. I get that this encourages trial and error but there are entire main facets that are crucial to winning that are unexplained by the game. Lastly, setting up matches in the multiplayer is a real pain. You have to re-select your character each time you want to do a new race, and if you're the host, changing the map takes you through a lot of unnecessary menus. It should have been a lot quicker. I should also mention that while you can play this with a mouse and keyboard, I find that the controls are entirely unfeasible. The only way I can play this is with a controller, perhaps that's just me.All in all, this is a comparable game to the classic Mario Kart (I guess it would compare to 8, but it's much, MUCH better than 8 in my opinion). It feels like a game that was made by a company that actually cares, not SEGA. Highly recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've seen this game for some time now and didn't really think much of it.  Finally, at it's super-low sale price I decided to give it a go.  I was a HUGE fan of ""Mario Kart"" - both for the Super Nintendo and for N64.  So this game had a little bit to live up to...HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥WAS I SURPISED.This game doesn't have anything to do with Sonic (aside from including him and the cast as characters...among cooler characters), it's just a balls-to-the-wall  come-get-some cart racer.  I don't think I've ever played a cart racer that felt so damned... HARDCORE.  The characters are all varyed but fairly balanced, the maps get absolutely insane, ranging from peaceful mario-kartish maps to nightmares from hell and beyond worst than anything the Rainbow Road could dream up.  And you get to enjoy all of these things not just from a Driver's Seat, but from a Cockpit and from a Captain's chair as well!The game is hard.  Even playing alone in world tour mode on ""Easy"" presents some challenge.  And it'll take you a good bit of practice to beat those same races on ""Normal"".  Step into multiplayer?  You better be prepared for a stomping, because those kids don't mess around.I give this game a solid 8/10.  It would be a 10/10, but the marketing department loses 2 points for not letting me know I should have been playing this sooner.BUY THIS GAME NOW.  Is it full price?  Then buy it.  Is it on sale?  Then buy a few extra copies for some friends of yours.  You won't regret it. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In my opinion Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is one & only competition for Mario Kart. The amount of fun that this game gave me cannot be measured. The game is super cute, colorful and entertaining. Single player content is enjoyable, but it's the multiplayer option that keeps you sucked in, which is not surprising.The characters are lovely, graphics is beautiful and music is also pleasantly blending in. If you are looking for something which could give you the Mario Kart experience, Sonic is for you. It is truly well made.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sonic & All-Stars Racing TransformedDeveloped by: Sumo DigitalPublished by: SEGAReleased: Nov 2012 (Consoles), Jan 2013 (Steam), Jan 2014 (IOS & Android), Oct 2016 (Backwards compat. for Xbox One)In short:Without a contest the finest Kart racing game released on PC.  Excellent port from the console versions, runs great, plays great with both keys or a controller.  Large selection of tracks themed around classic Sega games, full of alternate routes and 'interactive' track changes, all featuring sections where your vehicles transform into either flying machines or speed boats.  Plenty of single player content, very challenging on higher difficulties, but of course where the game shines is in multiplayer.  Supports local co-op up to four players, and also lets you play local co-op in online multiplayer.  Excellent net code, I've never noticed typical lag in friend or public lobbies.If you plan to go it alone be warned though, while there is an online playerbase still for the game it is pretty small.  Still , well worth having in your Steam library for those rare cases of couch co-op opportunities, or if you can round up some online friends for races.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bias: I am a dino. Gotta go Fast!One of my favorite racing games (besides Mario Kart). I am not the best at racing, however, I have thoroughly enjoyed this game and even held a few tournaments for some friends in different groups I am in. It took some time, but I was able to unlock all the racers and tracks to allow for variability. I am still not the best at slides but I have fun competing anyway.If you enjoy cartoony / mario kart esque racing games, this is a game for you.To be honest, I have no complaints. Maybe hope for more characters or tracks for this great title, but that was the only thing10/10 on a Dino Scale. I must play game if you have friends who you like to compete with.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably the best kart racer not called ""Mario Kart"". Depending on what day you ask me, I might even say its better than Mario Kart. Sumo Digital really ""gets"" Sega fanservice in a way that even Sega themselves do not. This game is, flat out, a love letter to Sega fans. All of the obvious references are hit, but expect to see plenty of Sega obscura get shoutouts. The artificial intelligence is really smart, too; don't expect Mario Kart's passive A.I., the CPU racers in this game want blood and will go out of their way to deny you important pickups. But, as long as you keep out of their line of sight and drift accordingly, things won't go too poorly. Legitimate driving skills will take you far in this game.The tracks are creative and varied, the game controls well, and the visuals are gorgeous. Like Mario Kart but don't own any Nintendo platforms? This is for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So after the pretty decent but somewhat shallow outing of Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing, Sumo Digital sure caught me off-guard when they announced a sequel to it. Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed does a good job at improving the flaws and shortcomings the first game had, such as making the courses more varied with at least 1 track based off a different franchise such as Jet Set Radio, Golden Axe, NiGHTS, Shinobi, etc. as opposed to just running with 3 or 4 themes for each course, more interesting track design with tougher placements hazards and they even brought in remixes of various SEGA franchise tunes to accomodate the soundtrack.Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed's main gimmick is having the vehicles and gameplay change constantly during the race, transforming your car  when you pass through large blue rings to either a boat or a plane. Some courses have a interesting mechanic in where usually the 2nd or 3rd lap has you driving through a completely different pathway, forcing you to adapt to these situations and work your way around these. Most racing game veterans will recognize this vehicle-changing gimmick from Mario Kart 7, but it reminds me more of the likes of Diddy Kong Racing from back on the N64, except that the courses are designed specifically for each vehicle mode rather than a wide-open track fitting them all. Also very important is that while you're in the air, flipping and rolling your vehicle is encouraged to build up boosts for when you land, but you have to be careful with this as not landing properly will costs you speed and lose all boost buildup, and there's switch-drifting which helps you maintain your drift boost buildup as you switch from steering left to right and vice-versa.Other new features are the mods that come with each character. Mods are pre-set custom stat adjustments that you can pick from on the character select screen to help you adjust to certain conditions better in the races and in missions in World Tour. (Explained later down below). If you get hit alot or crash into obstacles, acceleration suits your vehicle best and if it has alot of sharp turns, go for handling. Items are more or less kept the same, but given a new skin, such as the boxing glove to the missile, the barrier shield from Sonic to a glove which in addition to blocking either a stage hazard or a enemy projectile now gives you that item to use in return to get revenge on the attacker, if your item slot isn't filled with another item. Most items are balanced enough, but I will list my issues with them when I get to them.World Tour is also a new addition to this game specifically designed to cater to the more mission-based gameplay in where you need to clear races under certain rules or different gameplay methods, such as flying through rings in plane mode, winning consequtively from a set amount of opponents in the same race in a 1-on-1 format. The difficulty you clear these missions on affect the stars you get, which in turn are required to progress further in the World Tour's map and the real reward from doing them: unlocking new characters and special mods. Most of these missions are designed pretty decently, but your skill will be sorely tested on quite a few on them, especially in the unlockable Expert class difficulty.As for my issues with this game:- A few items are very unbalanced and usually can most likely make or break a race for skilled players. A good example of this is the ice weapon. You gain 3 shots of these by default, and while the game tells you that shooting all 3 shots at 1 opponent will freeze and stun them longer than normal, I notice no such difference, and every seperate shot stuns you as much as getting shot by all 3. The game developers tried to implement a way to make it hard for expert players to win races by a miles' lead compared to the other racers with the Sky Tiger item, a item that spawns giant wasps in front of the 1st place lead, but won't hurt the user if he passes by them while they're still active. It sounds fine on paper, but in terms of programming, it leaves alot to be desired. It works only fine on small passageways on car and boat plathways because it almost garantuees the 1st place lead can barely avoid them, but they can't spawn properly if used near a transform ring, and in the plane they are very easy to avoid due the large area's in the plane sections. It's also possible to shoot a wasp and clear yourself a way through them, which I think shouldn't be possible. It can be a decent counter to expert players, but this isn't comparable to the Blue Shell from Mario Kart by a longshot.- The method of unlocking characters in this game is very arbitrary compared to the previous game. If you want to play as your favorite character from the get-go and isn't available right at the start, you're going to spend a incredibly long time mastering the game's courses and mechanics just to be able to unlock them. For expert players this isn't a big deal, but casual players who don't have alot of free time on their hands will be annoyed by this, if they want to play as for example NiGHTS or Joe Musashi, it will take quite some time for them to even unlock them, when in the previous game you could just play a few races, earn points to spend in the shop to unlock them, and there you go.- The physics in a few courses, especially the boat sections in the game are very clunky and will cause the many frustrated losses of players. A good example of this are the boost ramps in the boat sections of Samba Tour and Adder's Lair in where if you approach the ramp from the side and not dead-on straight, your boat will tilt to ridiculous extremes and will lose all momentum and speed trying to readjust itself, or you will be launched way higher in the air than you're supposed to, and lose a good deal of speed as well. And there are also some courses in where some object events that occur in laps will actually hinder the player very drastically if they're not careful and going too fast, such as a robotic fish in the final lap of Ocean View causing the player to bump all over the place if they come in contact with it, spawning when the 1st lead reaches a specific area, and the bridge in Adder's Lair at the end of the 1st lap will not raise fast enough and cause the player to most likely crash into it and lose all speed. These are major issues and I don't understand why the developers couldn't iron out those bugs. -Unlocking the Expert class difficulty in World Tour is very late near the end of the mode itself, and forces you to replay every single mission you cleared before on the Hard difficulty all over again if you want all the stars in the game, which is a really cheap method of artifically extending the mode's gameplay length. Issues aside, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is a solid racing game, and I do recommend it for both racing game enthusiasts and fans of SEGA's franchises in general, but beware of the steep learning curve and having to deal with occasional frustrating glitches or lag in the online gameplay.

												Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed is exactly what it says on the box. Racing transformed for a modern era, while still having that classic feel making this a must own.For those of you feeling like Mario Kart has gotten a bit stale due to lack of innovation, this game may be more your style. This game is just teeming with love, with classic games bursting with modern visuals and sounds. Every part of this game just feels like a love letter to SEGA fans.GraphicsModernized graphics for classic SEGA games such as Burning Rangers and Panzer Dragoon. The visuals in this game are stunning when you play on the highest settings, and even with a modest computer you'll still get 60+FPS making this game feel amazingly fast and fluid. All the characters are well modeled and textured, and the levels are teeming with beautiful colors and lighting. Each level has been lovingly crafted from older SEGA titles and re-imagined in ways that will bring a tear to long-time fans.SoundThe music in the game mostly consists of remixed themes from older games in a mostly drum'n bass genre, with the odd dubstep-ish song thrown in here and there. But don't let that fool you, the dubstep is done in moderation and actually sounds good, even to someone who doesn't really like that genre. Each song feels fast-paced and full of action to make the gameplay that much more satisfying.GameplayNow on the the most important part, gameplay. As you may have guessed, there are 3 modes of driving, air, water, and land. Land plays exactly as you think it would, very much like Mario kart, but a bit faster and the cars feel heavier. Boating/water travel feels like slippery land travel, and is the hardest to steer on because of it. This is mostly noted in the Burning Rangers level, which is mostly boating with sharp turns in which you tend to go bumping a lot. Air travel is, well, air travel. You can still drift in the air, but you have to worry about your X axis as well, which tends to make it more difficult. You can also do stunts in the air as any vehicle, which will give you a boost if done correctly. Of course if you crash mid-stunt you're gonna go slower.The items/weapons in the game are well thought out and even if you get smashed by every single weapon, if you're a good enough player you can still get first place. No blue shells here. Although you may want to watch out for the bees.Value for the costAt $30 you will get way more than your money's worth. Tons of missions and unlockables, GPs to go through, stickers to unlock for doing certain things and of course, multiplayer. The multiplayer is really what will keep bringing you back to this. Online works well for the most part, and racing with up to 10 random people or friends is an absolute delight. Voice chat is included as well, and at the time of writing this there is no way to currently turn that off, but there is a patch on the way which will fix it.Final verdictA game well worth the money that will keep you entertained for many a month. If you've ever been a fan of racing or kart racing in general you'd be doing yourself a great disservice to not give this a try.9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												had a so much fun playing this game and its better the mario kart in my opinion -first of all the plot, well there is no real plot (sadly) , you just have to select a character ( around 20 + 3 from the dlcs and you can lvl up to get new mods to balance your kart stats and play with you own style) then select  a game modes (there is World Tour, Grand Prix , quick races , arena for multi ).-graphicly it's really beautiful and well detailed for a consol port (on ultra) also well optimized even for a potato pc.-gameplay: easy game mechanics ( arcade racing) with power pickups , each character (from different sega games + bonus characters like TF2 ) has his own different kart with different stats , the levels are inspired for different sega games  but the game is very unbalanced when it comes to difficulty ( easy is too damn easy , medium is like hard , hard is like dark souls hard and very hard is near impossible )-perfect  voice acting ,awesome soundtracks ( remixes of sega games main music)-for the controls ( the bad thing in this games) you need an xbox 360 controllers or use x360ce cause the keyboard is a no go -multiplayer is still live , you will find some people playing quick races.-time to time the game crashes but only when you exit the game so its ok i guess no big deal-achievements works fine but some of them are very challenging  -steam trading cardswell if you're looking for some fun between friends or solo then this game is for you ( no mario kart on pc so its not like you have any choice :p ) better get this one and skip the firt sonic all stars game , worth the money ( better get it on sales  4.99 $)9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sumo Digital did an amazing job with this game. Everything from the characters they brought, the tracks, the transformations, the PC exclusive characters, the optimization, it's unreal. It's literally a SEGA paradise.Even if you're not a fan of racing games, you'll REALLY love this especially if you're a huge SEGA junkie. The racing mechanics and soundtrack hook you in and want you to keep on playing. There's lots of replayability. Grand Prix, Missions, Time Trials, Online racing, Battle Mode, and much more.My only problem is the the way the cars control and the launcher which is the only way to change controls and graphic options, but again. Minor complaints.It's totally worth getting. Did I mention we have the best version of the game?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amazing racing game, it features racing on land, water, and air with transforming vehicles. It has over 20 playable characters and over 25 arenas and dynamic tracks playable in a lot of engaging game modes.I really like how they were able to set up the World tour. It has 4 difficulty settings and if you pay attention and observe how the opponents race, you can learn a lot even from easy ones. Aside from the standard race, there are a lot of events such as drift challenge, traffic attack, ring race, sprint, pursuit, battle race, and versus. Each of the events focuses on a game element to help players practice on a specific game mechanic.What is more interesting is that the local game can be played by up to four players (split-screen). If you can have some friends or relatives come over you can play race, battle arena, battle race, capture the chow, or boost race game mode. (Even the world tour can be played by up to four players.)As of writing, I have just started playing events under the Superstar Showdown, I have not yet tried to play online, I'll try finishing everything on hard level before doing so. Overall, I think this is the best kart racing game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sega, you nail'd it...This title could looks like a copy/paste of a classic mario kart racing, BUT IT ISN'T!We all know that the Sonic team likes to do so much meth, but this time they really work hard on this title. Every map is well designed, every character haves his styled veicle and every music fit his game's map. The poring of this game into the PC is not one of the best, but after some minutes of game, you will learn how to drive those frikin' veicle with no problems at all.The original thing that really impress me is the fact that the maps change every lap, they're not static, but interact with everything that is goin on in the background.But there are some problems, and some of those are ridiculous.Some model's eyes... they are staring at me.. REALLY THEY'RE ♥♥♥♥ING SCARY. Did they forget to give them some eyelids?! And the most stupid thing I've ever seen: Sega actually paid some companies for add their characters, and they decide to voice acting them selfing, giving us stuff like a tf2 Pyro who mumbles like he's (she's?) suffering the pains of hell (you see what I did here? No? k.)Last thing that kinda bothered me, was the decision to create extra maps that are actually maps already in-game, but mirrored. They really had to?In the end, this is a great title that I suggest you to get if on a nice sale, you can follow me, I'll set you free, if you trust me I'll make you escape from the track (I have no idea how to end this review).Final score: 7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Summary: Mario Kart in land, sea, and airMultiplayer: YesCompletion: 4-6 hrsCards: YesCloud: YesSonic Racing Transformed is pretty much the closest experience you'll get to Mario Kart on Steam. Since this is a fairly large genre as of late, Sega needed to come up with some sort of gimmick to make the game stand out. This game's gimmick is the ability for your vehicle to transform to handle water and air. I guess it works. It certainly keeps the laps interesting instead of going around in the same circles each time. The one annoyance is that controls of the vehicle change when it transforms. It's an added learning curve, but once you get the hang of it it can be enjoyable.The race tracks in Sonic Racing Transformed are inspired by various games from Sega franchises. I rather enjoyed the track design. I found them pleasing to look at and fun to play around in. The music remixes are also fun to listen to. In particular I enjoy the Afterburner stage and music. That one is a blast.There's several types of races you can run, but I would have liked a few more race modes. How about some kind of separate mode where you can buy upgrades for your cart with prize money you earn? Or maybe a demolition derby where you try to ram people off a track. How about an aerial dogfight battle arena?The weapons are a tad on the weak side. Very few really feel like game-changers, and the homing ability is spotty at best. They just lack the oomph that all Mario Kart weapons possess. I suppose this means that more skill is required in actual driving instead of facerolling with overpowered weapons, but I wouldn't mind a separate mode with said overpowered weapons.For the advanced racers, there's additional techniques to learn in the way of boosts, which I haven't nearly mastered yet. Mastery of this is integral to high level play.I'm baffled that there's no obvious way to change tracks in multiplayer. It's sort of hidden in the corner where you must select Options, and as far as I know, there's no random option. To the best of my knowledge, there's no grand prix  or world tour mode in multiplayer either. So far I haven't experienced much lag, if any, when playing with friends online, so that gets a good mark from me.I know it's not fair to keep comparing it to Mario Kart, but that's because it's hard not to when the game clearly takes inspiration from it. Sonic Racing Transformed might not be the best of the genre, but for Steam, it may very well be the best Kart game. I rate this game a 8.5/10.  It's a plenty good racer if you and your friends only have Steam and just want to kart race.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For a game that features racing across land, sea, and air, with a drift mechanic for all three, it's astonishing how accessible this title is. About the only downside I can think of is the amount of grinding required: you'll need to complete courses on harder difficulties to unlock the full character and course roster....oh, and despite being a fantastically-optimised PC port, the graphics options can only be changed outside of the game. Looking past this pet peeve, though, I'd definitely recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sega really did it with this game. Forget about the previous Mario Kart clone, this amazing racing game has it own personality and many things to add to the sub-genre. The graphics are amazing, the courses very well designed and full of details, and in a good computer the game will look impressive. The 3 types of vehicles are very different and give a lot of variety to the game. A lot of characters from many Sega franchises can be used, and even exclusive like a TF2 team.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this in a sale and have been blown away by it. Excellently fun racer, fantastic local multiplayer. Controlwise, a pad is fantadtic, but it plays just as well using the keyboard. The difficulty is just right also - as a new player, I'm struggling on medium difficulty.  Hasn't stopped me desiring to replay races though!Graphically beautiful,  soundtrack is great, so many nods to Sega's history.The roster might seem a little random, but even racing with characters like Football Manager can be pretty entertaining. Best of all - no blue shells! Totally recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sonic and All Stars Racing: Transformed, (or as I like to call it, SEGA All Stars Racing: Transformed) is a racing game featuring all of your favorite SEGA Characters race to the finish, as well as some random 3rd Party Characters. It features race tracks based off of worlds from Sonic games and most of SEGA's forgotten franchises and the racers vehicles transform from cars, to boats, to planes. So it's like Mario Kart 7, Diddy Kong Racing, that random Disney racing game and that Hot Wheels game that share the same idea of transforming race cars. I've never used a controller for the PC Version and I stuck to just using the keyboard, the nice thing about this is that you can adjust the controls for the keyboard to see which keys suit you more comfortably, and not just pressing random buttons all over the keyboard. The car and boat forms are cool, the boat forms are more fun as you can easily perform more tricks to get boosts. The plane form takes some time to getting used to when it comes to drifting while keeping your plane under control. The game features Career mode which is a series of different events, Grand Prix is a race to see who is the best, Time Trial is what you would expect, and Single Race is for racing on only one track, which I advise to try this feature out for practice if you just bought the game. The power ups can be useful at times, from the catchers mitt that catches the enemies weapon and being able to use it to your advantage, to chucking snowballs, ho ho ho. The All Star moves are back but are a bit disappointing. The first game featured the characters having their own specific All Star Moves with their own style and advantages, the sequel just transforms the player into the plane mode and fire's rockets at your opponents. There was also talk about special DLC that would feature more of SEGA's forgotten or internet favorite characters in the game, well it's been over a year and after that Yogscast guy was announced, I gave up on it since obviously SEGA only focuses on Sonic, they don't give a damn about their other franchises or even attempt to feature them in a new game again, and not just constantly porting their already made games onto every console. Besides, a good amount of people who bought this game only bought it just because it has Sonic characters, hence why the name Sonic is in HUGE font while the rest of the title is in smaller font. I rarely play as any of the Sonic characters from the first game (I use Bonanza Bros. all the time) and in this game. They're nothing special compared to all of SEGA's unique and forgotten creations. The 3rd Party batch of characters are very random and are just thrown in there for advertising gimmicks but hey, you can play as Pryo, Heavy and Spy that represent Team Fortress 2 in this game. So yeah, if your one of those few people that like SEGA's forgotten characters like myself, then you will enjoy this game like it's predecessor; you've got NiGHTS, Amigo, a living VMU named AGES, Vyse, Shinobi, and more.............................. but no Vectorman. :'(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is an extremley fun and addicting racing game much like Mario Kart, bringing back a lot of nostalgia for me back when I played hours upon hours of Mario Kart Doubledash on the Game Cube. The roster of All-Star racers rangers from iconic and not so iconic sega characters, characters from a few games and movies and even real life F1 Racer Danica Patrick... Interesting to say the least. The game can shift from three diffrent vehicle types during a race while adding stunt combos and an array of unique items to that of Mario Kart witch I actually prefer a lot more! I like this game a lot aswell as my roommates in college who regularly come in to join and play with me haha, brings back a lot of nostalgia.. And its cheaper then buying the whole game cube setup and doubledash.Pros:- Good Announcer and Sound Track- Visually stunning race maps with nice use of colors- Near Flawless Gaming Mechanics- Tons of racemodes to choose from during World Tour, Several Grand Pre races- Easy multiplayer match makingCons:- Wish there were more racers or possibly vehicle options for racers- Wish there was a bigger community of people who played this- Could possibly benefit from a DLC map pack ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There are a few glitches with getting hung up on the scenery and I wish navigating between rounds was a little faster, but this is an example of Sega at the top of their game in my opinion.

												Traditionally Kart racers have always struggled when pitted against the might Mario Kart series. SEGA have built upon the first game well and are putting up a great challenge to the crown.SEGA understand that a successful kart racer needs a mix of good tracks, great items, and fun characters. Most of the tracks in the game are brilliantly designed. A lot of them take into account the ability to transform between the three available states; kart, boat, and plane. This enables the tracks to evolve with each lap, offering racers something new to look out for.The items are all pretty instinctive, and there aren't too many of them. Every item has it's own use, and none feel like a waste or a duplicate.SEGA has drawn upon it's impressive back catalogue giving players a great variety of characters to drive around as. There's also a few cameos in there (like Team Fortress 2).The racing in the game feels fluid and responsive. The graphics are acceptable. The music is great, with some remixes of classic SEGA tracks included.The ability to transform is done well. It could've been something that was thrown in just as a gimmick, but SEGA have really incorporated it into the game, and it's obvious it was designed around this.By far the best addition from the previous game is online multiplayer. The multiplayer system works brilliantly, and that's what will keep me playing this for a long time.As always with racers, bring a gamepad!Bottom line: A great kart racer, that's even better with friends.

It has famous SEGA characters to play with, from the classic games since before the Dreamcast era until the new ones. The flying and water controls might be a little difficult to get used to, and the challenges to gain stars to unlock new cars and features are harder than its previous title. If you like colorful tracks, cars that has guns with funny noises and effects and losing friends just like in Mario Kart, that's the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll type a review, so here it is. Sonic and All Stars Racing Transformed is a great game, it's a game where players can race each other, there's something about that, racing people, that makes this game great, a real winner. Why just the other day I raced someone, it was a great race, great things were accomplished, and greatness was achieved. That's what this game does, it just wins and keeps being great. The races can be won, sometimes you fall behind, but does that mean you're a loser, of course, but someone has to be the winner, and that's what makes this game great, is because someone is always a winner. You have to race to win and in order to win you have to be great and that's what this game is, just something special. Thank you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's like Mario Kart for PC on steriods. The tracks are all lively and energetic, with amazing music backing it up, it feels like every track is one of those rides at Universal Studios where you go into the movie and see the characters. The huge but somewhat random character selection is nice, too. Difficulty curve is mostly good, however for standard race the three star system doesn't make sense to me...you only need 3rd against easy AI for 1 star, 3rd against medium for 2 stars, but 1st against hard for 3 stars? I stuggle to get that last one, however I usually get first when going for 2 stars, and am rewarded the same as if I got 3rd. Other than that, I think this is my favorite racing game. 9/10(Currently using JoyToKey and Mayflash Adapter to use my GameCube controller with it, it works beautifully)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a very well made Mario-Kart styled racing game which brings some of the iconic from Sega as you already recognized in the name of the game.There is a total of 30 playable characters in the game,each of them differ from the others,some are faster,some are slower etc.Now a big plus in this game is that the map you're playing on changes each time you reach the finish line,meaning a 3 lap race will not look the same all the time.You can be driving your kart and then all of a sudden road ends and you find yourself flying in the air while dodging many powerups your enemies throw at you.Also one of the pros is that this game has 4 person local COOP, which allows you to do the campaign with your friends.Its a big plus since in some of the events you could really use some help.You unlock your characters by completing levels and each level you get you unlock a mod for your car,which can be a speed mod,a handling mode and others.I play this game with my 7 year-old nephew and he absolutely loves it.If youre looking for a game in which you can relax and have some fun then this is the game for you.But be warned you need 2 controllers for COOP.Now the only con is that sometimes its buggy and the AI are extremely difficult if you crank up the settings.In some events you get absolutely annihilated and it kinda makes you rage.My final verdict is a very,very solid 9/10.

												I hated this game when I first played. I didn't like the tracks switching almost every lap. I didn't like the controls. I didn't like any aspect of it. Then my friend forced this game upon me by buying it and I'm glad he did. I really enjoy this game. The gameplay is pretty rock solid. This game is also certified local co-op! It's as easy as pressing start!""Another Super Mario Kart clone"". Perhaps, but this game does it's best to make sure your paying attention at all times. There is always an opportunity to boost or get ahead but proper steps need to be taken in order to make it to first. The biggest difference in this game in regards to other race battle games is that drifting (to acquire boost) is essentially critical. You don't have to hit an arrow to receive a boost. Rather drifting for a certain amount of time will give you a basic turbo. Keep drifting though and notice the color of your thrusters changing colors. Going from red to blue, you'll notice a definite kick to your character upon doing a successful drift. This is a big feature in this game where now it doesn't seem really appealing, but upon playing it the game mechanics will pull you in. On top of that, don't forget you can do tricks with the right stick if you want more boost!Is there weapons in this game? Of course! Some weapons (and defensive weapons) included are baseball glove (that catches and gives you the weapon fire at you), freeze-balls with the ability to freeze opponents, blowfish that sit like mines, wasp swarms that set up ""roadblocks"", a rocket that locks on to opponents, a firecracker that fires in a straight line, ""going all-star"" which is similar to Mario Kart's star except you can shoot specialized rockets that rebound and follow, boost and explosive hot rod engines. The beauty of firing weapons is that you have the OPTION of shooting them backwards or forwards. This is a neat feature as this adds another depth to the game.The tracks themselves (to say the least) are unique. I imagine it wasn't easy designing one course that would transform throughout the race. I should mention that the ""Transformed"" actually means that your mode of transportation transforms. It can either be a car, a (hover)boat or an airplane. So combine that with the tracks and you can get some challenging races but some over the top scenery to dodge. ""Drifting"" around a dinosaur in an airplane while trying to go through a boost while trying to shoot at an enemy is no easy work. The levels definitely seem like a lot of attention has been given to them.On top of all this, they've added different game modes. The main menu offers career mode, match making and custom game. What is really cool is (local) players can play online as well as play in career mode! Having a hard time with a time attack? Wouldn't hurt to have a buddy to help you out. Some of the varying game modes include boost challenges, evasion, time attack, single race and even attack simulations where you have to destroy a tank while dodging his attacks. Characters themselves have the ability to level up (depending on how much you play with them) and your buddies character can level up at the same time. Upon leveling up, you will unlock certain modifiers for your car (such as boost to acceleration, handling etc...).The visuals are decent graphics but it seems they attempted to pay attention to every little detail. For example, in the main menu there aren't much options regarding maps (as they haven't been unlocked). Upon unlocking them, you'll see more of these maps on your main screen. The maps as I've said are really interesting and really neat to play through. The characters at times will seem to fall out of their vehicle while doing stunts or boosting.The sounds are actually very good as each individual character has different dialogue for different situations. Little diversity concerning the explosion sounds and it would have been complete. I should add that when the announcer is saying 3-2-1 go that the player should hit ""accelerate"" (or RT) every time he says a number. This will give you a boost at the start.Overall, a really good game. It gives Mario Kart a run for it's money  but I wouldn't say it's better or worse. It's tough to compare the two but Sonic Racing is definitely fun.RATING : 7.5/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B+ Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B Overall  BScreenShots :  The usual screen you'll be seeing Drifting and boosting Really not a fan of player 2 being first ""Flyyyy like an eagle"" Nice glimpse into the scenery ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Make that a thumb sideways.Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is a mix of Mario Kart-like randomness and chaos, and Trackmania-like skill-based precision racing, and then some more.So it is a game with several very different game-modes and race types, in singleplayer you'll go through all of them, wether you like them all or not. How much fun you will have depends on what kind of preferences of racing game types you have, and I'll try to point out those things in this review.First off, if you're a completionist, going for 100% achievements or as close to that as possible, this game is quite ok into the 70-80% region, and then it becomes difficult, even frustrating, and a game of chance much more than a game of skill. That's a very clear thumbs down from this perspective. Most people don't care about that but I wanted to mention it for those who do.If you're a fan of fun racers with random weapon pickups, this game has alot of that, in singleplayer aswell as multiplayer.The randomness is really really prominent in singleplayer races against AI. No matter how good you are, winning in the hardest (""expert"", unlockable) and second-to-hardest difficulty modes is very difficult mostly, and when you win, you don't have the feeling that you did that, but you just got lucky with the pickups and the enemy AI's rubberband mechanism. Someone might be out there who does enjoy that kind of racing, but I didn't. As mentioned, it's the central part of the game.If you're a fan of driving skill based racing with no element of randomness, this game has some of that, too, and I happen to like those parts. The higher difficulties are a challenge, but it's how well you race that makes the difference, and there's a clear sense of progress and improvement with each retry. You memorize the courses, you spot shortcuts, get a feel for the physics model (unrealistic but that's ok) and the different unlockable drivers that handle differently, and most importantly you learn how to get ""boosts"" by performing slides around corners and stunts during jumps. So you have to keep an eye out for opportunities to do that, and pull it off with some skill and precision. I enjoyed these kinds of races the most. They come in different variations and make up about 1/3rd of the singleplayer game. Those variations are racing against the clock/against a pre-recorded non-random ghost, racing against AI but without weapons, drift challenges, boost challenges, and ring races in air levels.There are sections in the levels (with varying extent per level) of air and boat racing, that handle quite a bit differently. The air controls are a disaster, imho. The slower you are, the faster you turn, which is ok on paper, but it makes handling steep curves extremely imprecise and frustrating, especially when the curve is not only left/right, but at the same time upwards/downwards. They should have looked at the 15 year old Pilotwings 64 to get an idea of how to design good, uncomplicated but precise controls for such a game mode.The great downside to the game as a whole is, that, unless you happen to like all of these different kinds of racing, you'll hate some parts of the game. Due to how the singleplayer progression is designed, you can't really ignore those parts, if you want to progress through the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It is currently the free weekend for this game, and all it took, was a single, short race, in order for me to purchase it! I love this game. I've been hooked on it, all day. My brother and I have had several matches, I've been on single-player a fair bit, and I've played with some random people, online. All in all, my experience, so far, has been a great deal of fun, and wowing at the surprisingly tasty visuals, given the style of graphics.The game runs beautifully for myself, with an ASUS 760 OC, and my brother, with an XFX HD-5750. You might well have already gathered, but this game is simply not that graphically taxing. My brother and I both have an FX-4100 - mine is overclocked to 4.2GHz, whereas my brother's CPU is at stock, and for him, the game runs at 60fps, at a 900p resolution, with everything maxed, except he has motion blur disabled. I have even gone a step futher, and forced 8x Supersampling, and 16xQ CSAA - the game still runs butter-smooth. So, to summerize, this game should run beautifully, provided you're not running a computer with a Pentium CPU, 32MB SD-RAM, an ATI Rage 4MB GPU, and Windows 95, like my first Windows computer!One of the things I love about any game, are things that I can unlock and earn. Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed has more under the hood, than you might initially think. You'll see on Steam, that there are in-fact - as of this review's post date - 50 Steam achievements to earn. To my knowledge, there are 144 career stars to earn, ranging from various game-modes, with 3 difficulties: easy, medium, and hard. There is a GP mode (Grand Prix) allowing for 10 Grand Prix Wins. Time Attack mode sports 40 tracks on which to race, 20 being entirely different. There are 160 Staff Ghosts to beat, and each one is a different difficulty of time made on each track, from Easy to Expert. The game has 28 vehicles/characters to choose from, each with Mods, totaling 168 unlockable Mods, and if that wasn't enough, they can each be leveled up 6 times, using a simple experience system. While playing the game, you will do some impressive, and not-so-impressive things, earning you stickers - there are 100 stickers to collect, 3 of which can be shown-off on your license.As of the post date, there 2 bits of DLC available to you, currently £4.98 in total. I must admit, the DLC doesn't interest me, as I simply don't feel it justified to pay for minor content I feel might as well have just been in the game, at launch. To each their own, as they say.I do find the graphics to be very pleasant. Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed uses only DirectX 9, so don't expect flashy DirectX 11 features; this is a Sonic racing game, pure and simple.The music gives me a sense of nostalgia, with that unmistakable, Sega sound, however, after a while, the constant ""Sega sound"" blaring in your ears, may start to drive you crazy, so consider turning down that music, or disabling it!The controls are tight, simple, and easy enough to learn, provided you don't struggle with the TV remote, or putting on slippers. The wired XBOX 360 controller, works like a dream with this Sonic game, so don't hesitate to plug it and press that Start button. In-fact, it's so nice and comfy with the controller, that I've never tried it with the K&M!You might be wondering whether the multiplayer modes are any good - well, from where I'm sitting, they are great, with all the typical game modes found in single-player, and the ability to choose the very same characters/vehicles you've been leveling up and modding, all of which adds to a brilliant experience with your family, mates, or indeed strangers.All in all, I've had a lot of fun on this little gem, and I would certainly, strongly recommend it to any Sonic fan, or a fan of relatively old-school, kart-style racing.

-Quick Review-Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed is a Racing game developed by Sumo Digital, and released Jan 31, 2013. To sum up the game, it's basically like playing Mario Kart but with more content.(I don't want to say better or worse then Mario Kart, it really should be counted as it's own ""kart"" game, and not a knock off or anything like that)


There are three kart modes: Car, Boat, and Plane/Jet.

-Detailed breakdown review-Story: There's no story here, I could totally make one up for you though... With riviting details about how Sonic Team has sold their blue heghog to the highest bidder, and is now enslaved in a kart game where he must prove himself to be the best to win each and every game so that he will be able to compete in the obligatory Mario Vs Sonic Kart Game which will someday be developed (or was already developed and no one cared because it was for the wii-u)!*links my blog site where you can read more fan art*My Xbox 1 controller doesn't work: I recently purchased an x-box 1 controller and have been trying to cover controller controls on games with my reviews, but for this one apparently it doesn't like my xbox 1 controller. I just grabbed an x-box controller, I didn't know some games don't like 'em. I even tried downloading a button mapper which would emulate a regular x-box controller... no dice.In the end it was too much work, and I just concluded I'll get better with a keyboard and mouse, the problem is you don't know all the buttons unless you read a guide or somehow guess each button.Here's the basic's to get you started: Space is Drift, arrow keys will direct you, Shift to accelerate (P.S. your pinky-finger will hate you after a few races), and E to fire a weapon. You can also flip using WASD but I forget about the flips because I'm a baddy mcbad-face.If you want to save some time, check out any of the top rated Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed beginer's guides located here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/212480/guides/Gameplay: There are three game play types in Sonic All stars racing transformed (Yeeesh that's a lot to type, can we just call it Sonico-kart? No? what's that? there's a ""Sonic and SEGA All Stars Racing"" game in my library I will be reviewing eventually too? Well crap.)


The Campaign's Career character unlock and navigation Sample - Uploaded for Steam Review.

By: Atratzu




There are three game types: Career, Match Making, and Custom Game.For the Career you play against the AI, having easy, medium, and hard difficulty NPC's. In world tour there are 5 worlds and roughly 8 levels each world, plus character unlocks. In Grand Prix there are 5 cups, and 4 races per cup, lastly there's a lot of levels in time attack and single race mode (as you can imagine you can play all the levels individually, and there are also bonus levels!)Regarding Match making, you can play online in three game modes: Race, Arena, and Lucky Dip, there are also respective stats, win loss ratio, games played wins, and ratings, for all you junkies who aren't desensitized yet.Custom Game is exclusively for multiplayer, you can play local co-op, if you have enough controllers plugged in, you can play with up to 4 friends locally (we actually did do this when my brothers came to visit, they beat most of the Career for me... wait, should I not admit that?) and online you can play with your online friends.Okay, so we've talked about the types of game modes, and pretty well spelled out there's a lot of different levels to keep you busy for some time... How does the game FEEL?Well, it feels like a Mario Kart Game, but with Sonic Characters and Danica Patrick. (I don't know jack about racing people, but apparently she's in this game, along with other Sega characters, Wreck it Ralf, and... who the heck is Pudding?) You race along a course, the course will sometimes change on the last lap of a race, you pick up items, some will boost you, some will you aim and throw, others help the last place scrublord like me while playing online (...you could at least let me win one people, come on!)


As you play, you will unlock mods for the characters you're playing which will change how the vehicle preforms.  - Uploaded for Steam Review

Conclusion:  I'm not the best person to speak to when it comes to potential that a racing game has because I'm not particularly skilled at them to begin with, but I could easily see this game being the type of game you play with a group of friends like many of us used to do back in our Mario Kart Days on the N64. (Appeal to Nolstalgia successful *blows off gun smoke)What I'm trying to say is; I liked it. I'll play it more, I'm not good at it, but I don't feel like I need to be good at something to enjoy it.Hopefully this review has been either entertaining, informative, or inspiring. My name's Atratzu and I approve this review.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the first, best racing game I have played so far. You can pick your character, the mode which you will use in racing, you can represent your badges/stickers in online play, you can play different modes, play World Cup, Tour... and alot of things. The best thing that they have made - Graphics, Gameplay. It is really fun and relaxing to race along with such beautiful maps, and such smooth controlls. This game has a few mistakes, issues, and things.. [Controllers, Controller Menu, Settings, Glitches] But it doesn't make it bad. This is one of the best racing games, and it will stay the best!If you never played this, you are missing a bunch, so why are you looking at the reviews, you are suppose to play this beautiful game!Rate: 60/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												•	   Having your vehicle transform into four different shapes gives the game a great deal of variety. That, combined with the fact that most of the tracks change every other lap, makes it so that you don’t feel like you’re always doing the same thing.•	         Having seven different mods for every character makes it so you can use whatever character you like, even if you can’t deal with the way it initially plays (lack of handling / acceleration / speed / etc).•	         Has a decent amount of tracks (and of course, mirror versions) but could use some more. One of the DLCs added an extra track, but since not everyone has it, it never gets selected in online matchmaking. In addition, the new track feels pretty bland, there aren’t many obstacles or variety at all.•	         S class is pretty damn hard, mainly due to abusive amounts of rubberbanding. But once you master those tracks, it’s an awesome challenge and feels pretty rewarding to win. However, even S class isn’t much compared to online matchmaking, especially if you put yourself in a lobby full with players with their ranks in the 1500’s or above. S class challenges are also pretty difficult and require practice most of the time.•	 The online matchmaking itself works pretty well and it’s fun, but there’s (arguably) too much time between races. Ten seconds to vote for one out of three tracks, and then forty-five seconds just to choose a character is too much. Also, don’t make me choose my character after every race. Just give me the same one I used in the previous one by default. If I want to change into another one, I can…after all, I have forty-five seconds to do it….•	         Speaking of characters, the AGES character comes as a pleasant surprise, with its unique sounds and transformations which you’ll no doubt recognize. On the other hand, having NiGHTS and Reala in the game AS THE vehicle feels like a bad joke. At least their All-Star transformations look good.•	         There’s a healthy amount of achievements, even though it would have been cool to see every in-game sticker have its own. Some achievements involve playing with four local players, which is not a good idea. Not many people have that amount of controllers, not to mention the fact that split-screen multiplayer is becoming a thing of the past. It would have been more sensible to make these achievements doable with Steam/PSN friends.•	         The game runs great and looks amazing and crisp on PC, but as usual with sonic PC ports, there’s a specific zone (in this case the Samba Studios track) that tends to drop the framerate. That being said it’s still a pretty good port, but still suffers from the same problem as all the other sonic PC ports that came before it: the graphical options menu is in a separate executable and must be run before the game. Also it forces you to skip through a bunch of stuff before you get to the main menu every time you launch the game but at least on the PC, there’s a fix for that.As a conclusion, this is definitely an extremely satisfying and challenging game, especially if you have a couple of friends to play online with. SEGA will certainly milk this game some more by slowly adding more characters as they’ve been doing in the past. This is reinforced by the fact that the game is still selling and the online community is still pretty active.The game isn’t expensive and has been on sale again and again, with prices reaching under 7€ at times. Definitely a good buy for any fan of SEGA and/or kart racers.

												I enjoyed the first All Stars Racing game, but honestly I got bored with it pretty quick after finishing all the cup races. This is a fantastic sequel. The courses are better and they change a bit during each lap. The racing feels a bit faster. Racing now takes place in land, water and air, they all have a different feel and handling. Characters now rank up, so that adds some replay value. There is much more to do in this game than the previous with different game modes, including Online racing. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love to play this very fun arcade racer with my Girlfriend and Friends in Big Picture @ Home TV with Xbox 360 Controller. It has online multiplayer as well as local multiplayer.Its like Mario Kart, but i think its better. (yes, hate me for that)DO NOT play with a keyboard and mouse!!!!The Game:Boost, drift, find new power-ups and shoot enemys. Discover alternate routes and level up your Character to get better skills.Each character is equipped with their own unique vehicle that can transform into a car, boat and plane to take advantage of the changing terrains.Fun gameplay, no over powered weapons, and a good sense of speed. If you like games like Mario Kart then you will love this. DO NOT buy it for 10 @ Amazon or 20 @ Steam (and 20€ = 20 $ ?? the prices are not correct...) but get the Game @ Steam-Sale for 5 Bugs or in a Bundle (Humble Bundle etc.). (In addition @ Steam the DLC for this game is worthless, they  just adding new characters. WTF? SEGA = EA ?)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Note: I have not completed the game yet, I am writing the review as a ""first impressions"" kind of thing.Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed. I recently acquired the game on a sale, as it looked like a fun little racer. I went into the game pretty much blindfolded, not sure of what to expect.Gameplay and World:Good:» Tons of special modes like VS-Mode, drift-challange, boost-challange, etc.» Unique and beautiful tracks, which can even change inbetween laps.» Lots of choosable characters with different strengths and weeknesses.» In-depth risk and reward boost-system (boost for stunts and drifts).» Many fun powerups to use.» Surprisingly difficult on harder difficulties.» Options for touch-inputs and different sensors. Not something I'd use, but that is a very rare feature to see.Bad:» All PC-Related settings, like graphics and controls, have to be set in a broken and cheap-looking launcher.» How the AI uses powerups can be very frustrating at times, ruining the flow of the race.» Some characters feel very out of place. Some are more cartoony than others.» Drifting + Braking/Reverse use the same key, which makes sense on a controller, but not on a keyboard.» Shadows look kind of grainy, even on high graphics-settings.» Nitpick: Default keyboard layout is horrible (can be changed in the launcher tho).Misc:Settings:Ingame, only some gameplay and sound-settings are available. When you get the launcher to work (running as administrator), you have lots of graphics settings to your disposal. Every resolution seems to be supported. The launcher is just not clear on what kind of anti-aliasing it uses (spoiler: it's FXAA).Performance:This game performs beautifully! Surprisingly, I was able to get it running on my Windows-Tablet (Intel Atom, with integrated graphics) at 640x400 with 15-30 FPS. Would not have thought that it would get anywhere near that. So feel free to try this on a low/mid-spec PC, it's very well optimized.Summary:I was positively suprised by this game. I had my fears that this was gonna be some arcade-racer for kids, without any difficulty whatsoever, but it definitely proved itself to be a challenging and fun racing-game. If you like arcade-racers like Mario Kart and you are searching for an equivilant on PC, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is for you. Although it might be a little hard to get into if you are new to the racing-game genre. Definitely give it a spin!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oh god, so much memories awoken by this game, awesome animation, graphics and tracks. Soundtrax made me cry. God, I really love it. I recommend it to anyone, even to these who never played Sonic game series. It got lots more tracks than Sonic And SEGA All Stars Racing, and more events, though Misson section got changed, and has different structure. There are more Grand Prix'es than your eye can see, plus multiplayer mode to play with your friends or random people in Steam. This game is freakin' AWESOME!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably the best cart game in years.  Being able to transform in to a cart, boat, or plane during the race really adds the the content and makes it more exciting.  Being able to switch difficulties makes it harder for better players and easier for new players.  Not being able to switch difficulties in mario cart WII was one big problem for me.  It gets to easy over time.  With Transformed that never happens you make it as hard as you like(and let me tell you it is hard).  It is also one of the few 4 player splitscreen PC games out there.  PC gamer also gave it one more point on it's review score then Battlefield 4 lol.  Game: 8/10 (weapons and abilities could be improved seem boring, not very elaborate. No funny announcer like in the first one, also wish they had all the old characters from the first game)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For fans of the Mario Kart series, you will not be disappointed.Most clones of Mario Kart tend to be pretty terrible. Nearly unplayable, with ugly graphics, horribly designed stages, uninteresting characters, and just... not very fun to play in the slightest. They tend to be just quick cash ins on the Mario Kart crowd. Sega's latest crossover extraveganza doesn't fail to please. While, at the core, it may look like just your typical Mario Kart clone, it is so much more. Not only do you race by car, but mid-race, you could find your car transforming into a boat or plane.There's a single player campaign mode that allows you to play through a ton of challenges. Drifting, tank fights, flying through rings, and standard races. There's plenty to see and do in All-Stars Racing Transformed. There's a huge variety of weapons at your disposal to take out the competition and while not as interesting as those found in the Mario Kart series, they are fun to use and do the job. With 20 tracks (21 if you count the DLC track) and a currently still ever growing roster of characters, the fun is endless.Did I mention the online is fantastic, as well? Because it is. It's your standard online with 5 different game modes, but there is absolutely no lag, which is always a plus.So, if you're a fan of Mario Kart and also love SEGA and their IPs, you'll love this game.

												One of the best kart racing game on the PC. It brings back my fond childhood memory (I've played Crash Team Racing on PS1)!The race changes during each lap which brings a refreshing experience. This game is very much skill-based and having a paint scratch might make a difference between winning and losing the game. There's a lack of weapon variety but you still have to use them wisely. Overall, awesome soundtracks, great multiplayer, and the game runs smoothly on my GT 335M and an ultra low voltage CPU, which is a darn good console port. Not to mention the near-obsolete split-screen support! I recommend buying this if you are going to play with your friends or even alone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This has got to be one of the best kart racing games on PC. Rivaling giants like Crash Team Racing and Mario Kart.You get plenty of vibrant stages and characters to choose from. You can play the local career with 4 people or do racing in a variety of modes: single races, time attacks, capture the Chao or cup races and can also take part in battle modes locally, online for up to 10 player or even combined.And I didn't even get into the awesome power up system, the Transforming vehicles and stages that transform each lap.Simply put this game is packing content and you should already have it in your Steam library if you love Racing Games like Mario Kart. Or have ever wanted to try these types of games out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

B.D. Joe & All-Stars Racing Transformed is wonderfully arcadey, bright, colorful, runs silky-smooth and is generally a truckload (or boatload (or planeload)) of fun to play. It's the best racing game I've played in a long time.+ Colors! Cheer!+ Arcadey+ Challenging+ Makes very effective use of Wii-tier models & textures - Looks great and runs very nicely+ I've only played a couple of the games represented in this game for a few minutes apiece and I still love almost all of the characters (Amigo)+ Good soundtrack+ Lag shouldn't effect your movement too much online, with one major exception...- Vehicle-on-vehicle collisions online. Good God, the vehicle-on-vehicle collisions online. Some games try to handle physics but it still doesn't work too good. This game just doesn't handle physics. They don't even work for the host player. Works okay offline, though.- S-Class AI tends to be a bag of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥br>- There is a ramp on Burning Depths that you can crash into while trying to go over it, and you will lose if this happens. This is dumb.Verdict: I love it.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mario Kart for PC. They did an amazing job with this game, the level design is really well done and the way the levels change from lap to lap leading to seemless boat and air sections is brilliant. Loads of your favourite SEGA characters from Sonic, Nights, crazy taxi, and loads more and even a couple of wacky ones such as football manager. HIGHLY recommended, especially if you have a few buddies to play against. Worth the full price even in my opinion.Game Showcase-

												Haha This Game. Its a pretty dam good game actually.The track design for the tracks is pretty good. Good amounts of Car, Boat and Plane. (Nice change from just being a car in the first game)Got a fair few characters from the 1st one as well as some new ones such as Danica Patrick and Ralph (from wreck-it ralph) roster is about 20 characters i think so nice selection there.plenty of things to do in the game itself from Grand Prix's to free races to the world tour where you unlock characters.The controls are a bit funny but I didnt bother changing them just got used to them, though this game would be a lot better with a controller (that the game recognises).Playin this with friends is actually pretty dam fun, ive had a few races with some mates had a blast ^^Definelty a must buy occasioanally on sale for $7.50 or $5 so for that price def worth it.

												This is an awesome fantasy racing game.At first, I thought it would be a cheap copy of the mario kart franchise and, honestly, I bought it as a replacement for that game, a PC alternative - after finishing the entire campaign, which is really addictive, I was surprised and amazed at how it surpassed the former in every single aspect. Below are the key factors behind my mindset.PROS:- Awesome tracks with decent level design, featuring rich environmental details, excellent BGM and diverse gameplay mechanics;- Rich character roster with some oldschool SEGA characters, along with new ones. Each one of them has 3 different vehicle designs well fit to their personalities, used in land/water/air sections of the tracks. They are not some generic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t;- Challenging campaign, which sometimes requires complete mastery of the track.- The PC version is really well implemented, featuring stunning graphics.CONS:- Campaign coop is restricted to local coop. The internet multiplayer works very well, with no lags at all, but doesnt allow campaign mode.- The game locks you between Easy, Normal and Hard difficulties until you reach the last ""world"". Meaning that in order to unlock everything in the game, you are then forced to replay the entire campaign in a new master difficulty that is enabled in that world.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What can I say about this game ? I absolutely loved it when I first got it in 2012 and still play it all the time now in 2016. I've completed it 100% on so many different platforms and it never gets boring ! It's so much fun to play either single player OR multiplayer. The visuals are colourful and appealing, the level design is great, huge array of characters from throughout SEGA's history, the controls/handling is bang on and the soundtrack is great as well. There's loads of replay value as rather than just having races/GP to do, you have staff ghosts to beat (Which trust me, some are EXTREMELY hard on expert and you'll have to seriously 'get good' to beat them), and tons of challenges to do to earn stars to unlock new characters and MODS for the vehicles. The game is especially fun for long time SEGA fans with the track remixes and older characters making an appearence :) 100% recommend, worth every penny. There aren't enough good karting games that are fun both singleplayer and multiplayer that have a variety of things to do and this definitely gives even Mario Kart a proper run for it's money, in fact I much prefer it.

												Great looking kart racer.Perfect to play with friends and I didn't have any problems trying to play an MP game, even in the middle of the night.However after Medium difficulty, the SP AI starts cheating pretty hard, and in order to even catch up, you have to perfect all the trick boosts and not miss a single track boost. Even then, 1 or 2 shots on you will probably knock you out of the race, and all AI drivers will be focused on attacking you.So it pretty much turns into a 9v1 gauntlet.It wasn't fun for me to try to complete the game like that, but for people who enjoy the challenge, and like perfecting all the tracks and don't mind some cheaty AI, then you will probably put many many hours into this.

												Racing games have been a huge genre in the gaming industry, most racing games are really popular, like Mario Kart, Forza, etc., and there are really bad ones like Big Rigs Over the Road Racing. Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog in the late 90's made their own spinoff Sonic Racing games, but the first one's were Sonic R, and Sonic Drift, these two games were considered by many to be terrible. then during the time of the PS2, Sega released a new franchise called ""Sega Superstars,"" this game was really mediocre because it was one of the few games on the system to use the Playstation Eye, but it registered poorly, so the game was not good. Sega decided to step back into racing in 2006, with Sonic Riders, released for Gamecube, Xbox, PS2, and PC, this game was much better than Sonic R and Drift, it was different because unlike most racing games, this racing game used hoverboards, and a sequel was released in 2008.2 years after Sonic Riders Zero Gravity, Sega decided to revive Sega Superstars with a tennis game before 2010, and in 2010, we got Sonic and Sega All Stars Racing. This racing game released for Xbox 360, PS3, Wii, DS, and PC, recevied really positive reviews. So much that it could start comparing to Mario Kart.2 short years after Sonic and Sega All Stars Racing, we got the game were talking about today... Sonic and All Stars Racing Transformed. Released for Xbox 360, PS3, Wii U, PC, 3DS, PSVita, and mobile devices. So, is this a good racing game? Yes. The graphics on PC are stunning, especially in Max Settings, running 60fps, the colors are bright and colorful, and the small blur affects make the game a bit more intense. The gameplay plays like its original, Steer, Accelerate, Drift to charge up a mini turbo, and do tricks in mid air, which is replaced by flicking the right control stick in a specific direction, (I'm assuming you have a controller) the trick system is a lot simpler and quicker than the original.The main gimic of this game is the ability to transform your kart into a boat, or plane, in boat form, you can ride the waves and  perform tricks by jumping off waves, specifically big ones, and even ride on hot lava, literally. In plane form, you can fly around in the air, while doing barrel rolls to dodge mid air obstacles, such as giant dinosaurs, construction areas, magic bookshelves, and flying aircrafts.The game has a wide variety of modes, race, grand prix, time attack, world tour, battle mode, and even online, and the game has 20 race tracks and a large selection of Sega characters, and I mean it. You can even level up your favorite character and unlock mods for your character to customize their stats! So you can use your favorite character and still have good stats! Also, there are a handfull of collectable stickers and badges to put on your ID card.The soundtrack in this game is really good, with many remixes, but voice clips are resused from past Sega games. But it is still nice to listen to to say the least.If I had to give a final verdict on the game, I would say if Sega's goal was to make a racing game that uses features from many other Sega franchises, and bundle it all into one epic racing game, than they accomplished that very well, the gameplay is good, the soundtrack is epic, the online is fun, the selection of characters is great, and the graphics are beautiful to look at on the PC, but not so much on the Console versions of the game. This is a fantastic racing game that will keep you playing for hours, and has really fun online, I can safely say that this is one of the best racing games out there. I score this game with a 9/10. $20 is a good price, but in the steam sales, $5 is ridiculous, you better buy this in the sales! I reccomend this to any racing fan out there! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												don't mind my little play-time because we usually play this game 4-player splitscreen (we even did 2x2=8 players once with two computers) with a projector at a friend's house. for the whole of last year, we came to a point that going out at a pub and getting a (social) life was far far behind in terms of priority compared to these small parties that we get wasted and play sonic for hours and hours. the whole crew kinda got lost in various MOBAs but we can't stop getting back to Sonic from time and time again.and even though we usually play this game sharing a couch, it still is the first game i restore after a routine format to my hard drive.

												Easily one of the most consistent comic racing experiences I have personally had the pleasure of encountering since... Mario Kart Wii. You have a lot of characters to choose from (and they all look brilliant) You have a healthy selection of tracks borrowing the settings of a plethora of your favorite SEGA titles The music will blow your socks off Items are plenty fair The game itself looks stunning and doesn't ask for much in regards to specs Transformation is a magical gimmick like no other Plenty of game modes to choose from and online isn't necessarily as dead as it is on console I can go on all day about the things I like about this game so I'll stop myself short; it's all praise from here except for just one thing: Diversify your character selection to avoid the grind that is maxing out your entire roster.On sale or full price you'll find it hard to regret the buy.

												30 hours. All EXPERT events cleared.When it showed ""Congratulations! You are an all-star player"" in the end, I remembered the days I was playing SSAR years ago. I was a high school student then, but not before I became a sophomore did I play SART. And I have been a Sonic fan for about ten years.K let's get into the game. While SSAR is too simple as a racing game, SART is much better. More complicated and hardcore controlling is needed if you want to play SART. Transforming into three different types and different tracks in different laps are also very enjoyable. Unlike SSAR, different characters and different mods are a lot more different in performance. I have to admit that I didn't believe it until at a boost challenge I had failed for hours with Shadow but cleared it only one time with Tails.NPCs in HARD mode and EXPERT mode are cheating. They are usually quicker than us and can accurately hit back, which is very annoying. And other challenges like boost challenge give us very little time. In this game, not every character can finish every challenge. If you get stuck at one event, try changing for another character. I recommend Sonic(Genesis Mod) and Tails(Standard or Handle). The former is heavenly fast while boosting, and the latter is surprisingly flexible. Beginners may have a hard time going through the events, but when they practice for some time, they are sure to complete the EXPERTs. In a word, the challenges in SART are a bit easier than those in SSAR. I can still remember the time I struggling in a star-ring-collecting rank S challenge in SSAR - that was HELL.Like SSAR, SART also has a strange sense of gravity. For example, if you are hit when running upside down, you will not fall off the road. However, it feels good to some extent, for example I enjoy the map Casino Park. Similar to SSAR, maps in SART are all originated from other SEGA games expect one map. But some maps in SART directly come from SSAR, only with a few fixes. Anyway, repetition is better than none.There are few bugs in SART, although mysterious trick fails and turn-arounds happen sometimes.Cars in SART, in my opinion, might be lack of characteristics. SSAR is good, where Tails's car is a plane like the Tornado and Shadow's is a motorcycle from GUN. However in SSAR, Tails's car is just a yellow racing car, and instead of the motorcycle, GUN gave Shadow... a dodgem? lolIn conclusion SART is a good game worth to play. But if you ask me to recommend a Sonic racing game, I would recommend Sonic Riders series. Why don't SEGA bring Sonic Riders on Steam? Never know.P.S. I am not a native English speaker. Sorry for some errors in language.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is the next installment of the Sonic & All Stars series, with the first one called Sonic & SEGA All Stars Racing. This game has taken the faults of the original game and fixed them, giving you plenty of difficult challenges that will take multiple attempts to complete. The 'transformed' side appeals to the unique change of vehicle throughout the levels, with your vehicle being able to become a car, boat or plane. The car designs are all very well done and represent each character perfectly and each franchise characters belong to usually have a course that corresponds with them. (i.e Egg Hangar for Sonic or Shibuya Downtown for Jet Set Radio) The courses have three laps in most cases and the surroundings change with each level, some telling stories of what's going around you, like a flying pirate ship takeover in the Skies of Arcadia level. They're all very well animated and beautiful to look at, with not a single dull level in the roster, my favourite being Dream Valley, reminiscent of NiGHTS. You have a choice of doing the career tour mode or individual races, with each cup having levels from C-A and when you unlock it, S. These make the races/challenges harder for you to earn star points, which buys console mods, characters and gateways to the next cup. I struggle at getting A's, it's incredibly hard to do and takes many tries to figure out the best way to approach a challenge, such as defeating a tank with rocket launchers, drifting in glowing roads before the time runs out or speed racing a ghost character. Overall, it's the best racing game in Sonic's history and I daresay its better than the recent Mario Karts by miles, purely for how much detail went into perfecting this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												it was worth for me after i heard that voice saying ""SEEEEEGGGAAAAAA"" at the beginning like if you play sonic on a sega megadrive/genesis but let me tell u something about the game. u have diffrent modes like Worldtour (where u can do challenges like drift-challenge, battle-challenge, ring-challenge where u get stars to unlock new challenges), Grand Prix, Race against time (vs staff ghosts too) and Single race. this is mostly standard i know but there is this awesome ""Player 2 connected* voice after u press the start button on a controler up to 4 players (you can make the voice rage too by rapidly press the button with 4 mates local) and you can play everything in the game with your local friends, (dat means every mode even online vs 6 others.) online you can play with 10 players in races or battle modes. The music is typically beginning of 2000 videogames and the background animations are like in every sega game wonderful, u got very much to see if u can handle it while drivin. and dont forget this is ""Transformed""... this means u transform between a boat, car and a plane wich is awesome (the boat isnt that much but hey the other guys around the world dont like it too) so if you have friends (dont laugh, some dont have) then buy this on a sale, buy a sixpack for you and your 3 friends, prepare 1 (really guys, i recommend just one) spliff and you will get a really funny night. repeat it every time you had a bad day but just if you dont have to work the next day cuz u cant stop with friends.

												I was a fan of Sonic from a very early age, and the only Nintendo products in our house were Gameboys, yet I still never thought I'd buy this game. During the 2012 holiday sale I bought the Sonic bundle (before this game was added to it) but I figured this would be no great loss, because after all it's just another Mario Kart clone right? Perhaps and also perhaps not. Sonic has a lot more going on than any other kart game I've played, and doesn't have the same obvious rubber banding that is present on the more recent versions of Mario Kart, which leaves you feeling more in control of what is actually happening on screen rather than having Nintendo pushing you along with magic bullets and saying ""That's it just a little further, the rest of them aren't that far in front of you"" before walloping the person in first place for making the other kids look bad. The Sonic karts handle nicely, the ability to perform stunts has been added to get speed boosts, tracks attempt to cause sensory overload in the most excruciatingly pleasing way possible, and your kart frequently transforms into a boat or plane depending on how the track has been destroyed since your last lap or whatever obstacle is coming up. This is a great game to play with friends, but it's equally as good to play by yourself given all the challenges and unlocks that are available. Unlocks based on game progression are absolutely how this sort of game should be done, so I was somewhat disappointed to find that Sega had released a robotic Sonic DLC - but assuming this is just a skin I suppose you can't blame them for trying to wring every last cent out of us. Mind you, this game was a gift so I'm in no position to have a whinge about that. Had I not been given this game, I wouldn't have realised just how good it is, and how it is well worth buying.

												I normally don't care for anything 'Sonic,' having grown up with Mario, and I don't care much for cart racers also but man, this game is awesome. Loads better than Mario Kart, in my opinion, with better design, flow, weapons, track layouts, presentation, etc. Don't really like the boat parts, but the car and plane parts is really fun. No cheap♥♥♥♥♥weapons like MK's stupid blue shells.I don't really know any of these characters besides the PC exclusive ones and Sonic ones (obviously), but that doesn't stop me from having a blast with this game. This is a must buy for cart racers, even if you hate Sonic and/or cart racers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Racing games have been a huge genre in the gaming industry, most racing games are really popular, like Mario Kart, Forza, etc., and there are really bad ones like Big Rigs Over the Road Racing. Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog in the late 90's made their own spinoff Sonic Racing games, but the first one's were Sonic R, and Sonic Drift, these two games were considered by many to be terrible. then during the time of the PS2, Sega released a new franchise called ""Sega Superstars,"" this game was really mediocre because it was one of the few games on the system to use the Playstation Eye, but it registered poorly, so the game was not good. Sega decided to step back into racing in 2006, with Sonic Riders, released for Gamecube, Xbox, PS2, and PC, this game was much better than Sonic R and Drift, it was different because unlike most racing games, this racing game used hoverboards, and a sequel was released in 2008.2 years after Sonic Riders Zero Gravity, Sega decided to revive Sega Superstars with a tennis game before 2010, and in 2010, we got Sonic and Sega All Stars Racing. This racing game released for Xbox 360, PS3, Wii, DS, and PC, recevied really positive reviews. So much that it could start comparing to Mario Kart.2 short years after Sonic and Sega All Stars Racing, we got the game were talking about today... Sonic and All Stars Racing Transformed. Released for Xbox 360, PS3, Wii U, PC, 3DS, PSVita, and mobile devices. So, is this a good racing game? Yes. The graphics on PC are stunning, especially in Max Settings, running 60fps, the colors are bright and colorful, and the small blur affects make the game a bit more intense. The gameplay plays like its original, Steer, Accelerate, Drift to charge up a mini turbo, and do tricks in mid air, which is replaced by flicking the right control stick in a specific direction, (I'm assuming you have a controller) the trick system is a lot simpler and quicker than the original.The main gimic of this game is the ability to transform your kart into a boat, or plane, in boat form, you can ride the waves and  perform tricks by jumping off waves, specifically big ones, and even ride on hot lava, literally. In plane form, you can fly around in the air, while doing barrel rolls to dodge mid air obstacles, such as giant dinosaurs, construction areas, magic bookshelves, and flying aircrafts.The game has a wide variety of modes, race, grand prix, time attack, world tour, battle mode, and even online, and the game has 20 race tracks and a large selection of Sega characters, and I mean it. You can even level up your favorite character and unlock mods for your character to customize their stats! So you can use your favorite character and still have good stats! Also, there are a handfull of collectable stickers and badges to put on your ID card.The soundtrack in this game is really good, with many remixes, but voice clips are resused from past Sega games. But it is still nice to listen to to say the least.If I had to give a final verdict on the game, I would say if Sega's goal was to make a racing game that uses features from many other Sega franchises, and bundle it all into one epic racing game, than they accomplished that very well, the gameplay is good, the soundtrack is epic, the online is fun, the selection of characters is great, and the graphics are beautiful to look at on the PC, but not so much on the Console versions of the game. This is a fantastic racing game that will keep you playing for hours, and has really fun online, I can safely say that this is one of the best racing games out there. I score this game with a 9/10. $20 is a good price, but in the steam sales, $5 is ridiculous, you better buy this in the sales! I reccomend this to any racing fan out there! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												30 hours. All EXPERT events cleared.When it showed ""Congratulations! You are an all-star player"" in the end, I remembered the days I was playing SSAR years ago. I was a high school student then, but not before I became a sophomore did I play SART. And I have been a Sonic fan for about ten years.K let's get into the game. While SSAR is too simple as a racing game, SART is much better. More complicated and hardcore controlling is needed if you want to play SART. Transforming into three different types and different tracks in different laps are also very enjoyable. Unlike SSAR, different characters and different mods are a lot more different in performance. I have to admit that I didn't believe it until at a boost challenge I had failed for hours with Shadow but cleared it only one time with Tails.NPCs in HARD mode and EXPERT mode are cheating. They are usually quicker than us and can accurately hit back, which is very annoying. And other challenges like boost challenge give us very little time. In this game, not every character can finish every challenge. If you get stuck at one event, try changing for another character. I recommend Sonic(Genesis Mod) and Tails(Standard or Handle). The former is heavenly fast while boosting, and the latter is surprisingly flexible. Beginners may have a hard time going through the events, but when they practice for some time, they are sure to complete the EXPERTs. In a word, the challenges in SART are a bit easier than those in SSAR. I can still remember the time I struggling in a star-ring-collecting rank S challenge in SSAR - that was HELL.Like SSAR, SART also has a strange sense of gravity. For example, if you are hit when running upside down, you will not fall off the road. However, it feels good to some extent, for example I enjoy the map Casino Park. Similar to SSAR, maps in SART are all originated from other SEGA games expect one map. But some maps in SART directly come from SSAR, only with a few fixes. Anyway, repetition is better than none.There are few bugs in SART, although mysterious trick fails and turn-arounds happen sometimes.Cars in SART, in my opinion, might be lack of characteristics. SSAR is good, where Tails's car is a plane like the Tornado and Shadow's is a motorcycle from GUN. However in SSAR, Tails's car is just a yellow racing car, and instead of the motorcycle, GUN gave Shadow... a dodgem? lolIn conclusion SART is a good game worth to play. But if you ask me to recommend a Sonic racing game, I would recommend Sonic Riders series. Why don't SEGA bring Sonic Riders on Steam? Never know.P.S. I am not a native English speaker. Sorry for some errors in language.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is the next installment of the Sonic & All Stars series, with the first one called Sonic & SEGA All Stars Racing. This game has taken the faults of the original game and fixed them, giving you plenty of difficult challenges that will take multiple attempts to complete. The 'transformed' side appeals to the unique change of vehicle throughout the levels, with your vehicle being able to become a car, boat or plane. The car designs are all very well done and represent each character perfectly and each franchise characters belong to usually have a course that corresponds with them. (i.e Egg Hangar for Sonic or Shibuya Downtown for Jet Set Radio) The courses have three laps in most cases and the surroundings change with each level, some telling stories of what's going around you, like a flying pirate ship takeover in the Skies of Arcadia level. They're all very well animated and beautiful to look at, with not a single dull level in the roster, my favourite being Dream Valley, reminiscent of NiGHTS. You have a choice of doing the career tour mode or individual races, with each cup having levels from C-A and when you unlock it, S. These make the races/challenges harder for you to earn star points, which buys console mods, characters and gateways to the next cup. I struggle at getting A's, it's incredibly hard to do and takes many tries to figure out the best way to approach a challenge, such as defeating a tank with rocket launchers, drifting in glowing roads before the time runs out or speed racing a ghost character. Overall, it's the best racing game in Sonic's history and I daresay its better than the recent Mario Karts by miles, purely for how much detail went into perfecting this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an awesome fantasy racing game.At first, I thought it would be a cheap copy of the mario kart franchise and, honestly, I bought it as a replacement for that game, a PC alternative - after finishing the entire campaign, which is really addictive, I was surprised and amazed at how it surpassed the former in every single aspect. Below are the key factors behind my mindset.PROS:- Awesome tracks with decent level design, featuring rich environmental details, excellent BGM and diverse gameplay mechanics;- Rich character roster with some oldschool SEGA characters, along with new ones. Each one of them has 3 different vehicle designs well fit to their personalities, used in land/water/air sections of the tracks. They are not some generic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t;- Challenging campaign, which sometimes requires complete mastery of the track.- The PC version is really well implemented, featuring stunning graphics.CONS:- Campaign coop is restricted to local coop. The internet multiplayer works very well, with no lags at all, but doesnt allow campaign mode.- The game locks you between Easy, Normal and Hard difficulties until you reach the last ""world"". Meaning that in order to unlock everything in the game, you are then forced to replay the entire campaign in a new master difficulty that is enabled in that world.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There are 2 incredibly unique things about this game. 1) It is a AAA Kart-racer on Steam. You aren't gonna find Mario Kart here, so unless you have a console, this is your only chance. 2) It is hard. Mario Kart and other Kart racers can be hard, too, but that is because of rubber-band AI and cheap items. The items in this game all require thought and skill to use and can be avoided with just the same. The AI is very difficult, but that isn't because they go faster as you get ahead, and if that actually puts anyone off, the online experience is also a great time. Also, as apparent from the recent DLC, it is a game that appreciates its online followings. When Mar becomes playable, we would have the perfect game. Minus a few balancing issues (in SP each lap starts the same, even if your main opponent is up front and you're in back) this is a very worth-while game. Even if it wasn't, though, It is a kart racer on Steam and I can play as JSR characters. It had me sold before I even played it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My karting days go way back to the godfather of karting games Super Mario Kart on the SNES. Having played the majority of clones and spin off games since, it'd be fair to say I'm in a decent position to give a valued and trusted opinion.Aside from perhaps Speed Freaks on the PS1, this is hands down the best Mart Kart clone available today. The added flight and boat modes do not take away the fun or karting aspects of the game and really do enhance the experience. I definately recommend this to anyone who enjoys karting games or arcade style racing in general. Well worth the £14 this game is currently listed as. If your lucky enough to catch it on Steam sale, grab it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I never thought Mario Kart would ever be topped by another kart racing game. I was wrong. This game completely and utterly blows it out of the water. There are so many things Racing Transformed has that other racers only wish they could brag about. The transforming tracks are the biggest reason and I really hope other developers take notes on this. It does wonders for replay value. Even though the same changes happen every time you play a course, this makes tracks stay entertaining for longer. The vehicle transformations may be what the game advertises, but the courses that transform are by far the best part of the experience. And speaking of vehicles, the transformations are actually handled really well. It takes a bit to adjust to the plane controls at the start but it's easy to get a handle on them after a race or two. The dreaded waterboat controls of most racers don't exist here. There's a lot of drifting, but drifting is easy to pull off and most of all fun.There is of course a grand prix mode for single player, but in addition we are given World Tour mode. You select from a map of challenges that unlock as you complete previous challenges and earn stars depending on the difficulty you complete events. The majority of characters in the game are unlocked by possessing a certain amount of stars, so it is a good idea to go back to old events and try them on a higher difficulty. There are many different kinds of events, and the vast majority of them are legitimately fun. Most racing games that attempt this come off as gimmicky, but there's a lot of fun to be had trying the different events out. The AI is also really well balanced. Easy mode is a cakewalk, Medium gives you more challenge but is generally not that bad, and Hard mode is tough but not impossible. An additional Expert difficulty is unlocked and you'll have to be incredibly skilled at the game to pull off wins there.This game has a very wide selection of characters from Sega history, as well as a few guest characters. The roster is well chosen for the most part. Fans of the first game will miss characters like Jacky/Akira from Virtua Fighter, Opa Opa, Bonanza Bros, Zobio from House of the Dead, and the Chu Chus. Newcomers that make up for those omissions include Nights, Vyse from Skies of Arcadia, Joe Musashi from Shinobi, and Gilius from Golden Axe. In addition the pc version adds some characters from Sega's franchises on steam. You can play as Football Manager, the Shogun from Total War, Willemus from Troy, and even Team Fortress. Each character can level up with experience gained from racing, and each level unlocks a different mod. These mods tweak the character's stats, and this is a very good feature. For example I really like Gilius, but he has a terrible acceleration stat. I could use his acceleration mod to increase that in exchange for a lower top speed. This opens up a lot of possibilities and lets you play characters you like regardless of their stats. All in all there is a ridiculous amount of fanservice in the game. I do wish they wouldn't have cut some of the old game's cast, but it's hard to complain when the variety of characters is so great. The course selection is varied as well and balanced between many different locations.To summarize, the game has a ton of content and a ridiculous amount of polish to make it one of the best racing games I've ever played. Everything from the mechanics to the fan service to the single player campaign is well done and I'd love to see Sumo try to top this effort.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Basically Mario Kart for the PC, with all the same fun.  The controls are great on an x-box controller and work suprisingly well on just a keyboard if thats all you have.  The only issue ive seen is that some computers will load the game after the race has already began, this seems to happen more with computers with slower harddrives, so occasionally in some races you will start out with a cler handicap if you have an slow harddrive.  This can be mitigated by having the person with the slowest harddrive host the games, but even then i've seen the game load after the game started.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've just started playing, but I was pleasantly surprised by the way the game tries to expand on th typical four player cart racer scenario. In case anyone is on the fence, this is NOT a Mario Cart type of cash in. The smooth mechanics, interesting visuals, and character balance actually create something incredibly uinique and worthwhile, which is kept fresh by a variety of game modes and complicated stages. I'm looking forward to playing a lot more of this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I used to never understand what's the fuzz about this game. It's just a game where sonic drive a car, yet it get a lot of overwhelmingly positive feedback. Then there's a sega sale with 90% price cut, so I think what the heck I might as well get one. And the experience? is amazing!Despite the fact this game were released under the seventh generation of console, it has a great graphic. Running smoothly 1080p 60fps on my steam link. Heck, I can even run this game on my 2006 Core 2 Duo with medium setting and a decent fps. Works great with my F710 without a problem at all. The tracks are amazing! and Ryo Hazuki is still the best thing about this game.10/10 would ride a bike over a boat!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Graphics: 9/10Sound: 9/10Gameplay: 9.5/10Value: 9.5/10Total: 9.25/10Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is one of the best racing games I've ever played.  Unfortunately the multiplayer is pretty dead these days.  I got this game when purchasing the Sega Collection for a very nice deal a couple years ago.  Being hopelessly bored one day, I decided to try the game out.  I was not disappointed.I recently played Mario Kart 8 for the first time on a friends Wii-U.  Sonic racing was easily better.  The game can be a real challenge sometimes.  The scenery is amazing throughout the levels as well.  I found myself playing the crap out of this game until I'd pretty much gotten every achievement besides the multiplayer ones.If you can find this game cheap and don't mind single player racing, this game will take you for a wild ride that you will not soon forget!

												PC gets few kart racing games, and its a good thing Sonic and all stars racing transformed is one of the besta fast and exciting game which finds its own identity in a genre dominated by mario kart, your kart can transform into a plane or a boat at certain points during the race spicing up the gameplay, and not only your kart transforms, certain tracks also change during the race, forcing players to adapt quickly if they want to keep the lead, the main complain in the gameplay department id say is the weapons, which while well designed are rarely cheap, are a bit uninspiredthe game features many modes, including world cup, grand prix, time attack, single race and multiple multiplayer modes AND spliscreen multiplayer(!!!), you will definitively get enough bang for your buckthe graphics are also surprisingly good, with a bright and rich color palettecompared to the other versions of the game, PC is arguably the best, it features more characters than any other version and it includes 5 characters exclusive to the PC version, football manager (from the football manager franchise), shogun (from the total war franchise), teamfortress (the spy, pyro and heavy, which count as one racer, from Team Fortress 2), general winter (from the company of heroes franchise) and willemus (also from the total war franchise)the port is for the most part average, with the ocassional graphical glitch which can be fixed by disabling certain special effectoverall, fantastic game, and quite easily one of the most fun steam games ive played			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												We all grew up playing the Mario Kart games.  I remember playing split-screen on the Super Nintendo while others may have gotten their first taste with Mario Cart 64 or Double-Dash.  Its a fun twist on the racing genre and Sonic was long overdue for a spot in the limelight.  That is not to say to this is Sonic's first racing experience but its easily one of his best; it finally puts him on par with his rival.  A ton of different characters and tracks along with superb vehicle handling make this is a top-notch racing game.Game play is key to any racing game and this one is exceptionally smooth.  This game is quite unique in the fact that you race across land, water, and in the sky.  Thankfully, the vehicles handle smoothly across all three modes.  The drifting is very satisfying and is quite easy once you get used to how it feels.  You'll be drifting a lot as you'll get a boost that varies in strength depending on the length of your drift.  If you need some assist there is an array of different power-ups at your disposal.  These range from homing RC drones, to big fat blow-fish, to snow balls.The content in this game, especially in the career mode, is quite astonishing.  First and foremost almost everything can be played via couch co-op which is a rare find these days.  The career will have you compete not only in races but various challenges such as races that require you to constantly drift or races that require you to meet checkpoints while avoiding traffic.  The easier difficulties will make this game fairly accessible while the hard difficulties can be quite challenging.  All the game modes will reward your character with experience points for finishing racing.  These will unlock different mods you can use to change the stats on your vehicles.Sonic is one of a dozen or so IPs represented in this game.  There is a bunch of characters from the Sonic universe including Tails, Knuckles, Amy, and Shadow.  You'll find them racing along the likes of Beat ( Jet Set Radio), Ulala (Space Channel 5), Aiai (Super Monkey Ball), Amigo (Samba De Amigo), Ralph (Wreck it Ralph), and many more.  You'll race across multiple tracks that represent just as many different games.  The character models look just as good as the tracks which are brimming with personality.  Some tracks feature each vehicle mode evenly while others focus one or two more than the others.  Almost all the tracks change each lap giving each race an exciting cinematic feel.Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed is a successful modern twist on the classic kart racer genre.  The races are fast and frantic.  You'll feel great as you pull off tight drifts or knock out opponents sneaking up behind you.  There is a wonderful variety of much loved characters and locations featured in this game.  Bring a friend over to enjoy the robust co-op that is accessible across almost the entire game.  No matter how you play it or who you play as you're bound to have a great time playing this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game presents a time and space anomaly of disastrous proportions. If this is not addressed soon, I fear the SEGAverse may collapse in on itself and create a singularity impact that will swallow the third dimension. Not only should it be physically improbable that a russian general can enter a kart race with a tank to race against an anime sky pirate, but the fact that there is a kart racer that could be argued to be as good or possibly better than Mario Kart means that we may have possibly experienced twist in the time lines that has given us a Sonic the Hedgehog kart racer that is not terrible.I will attempt to do more research into the subject, but in brief, my theory is that All-Stars Racing may possibly be a good video game that you would wish to purchase. I will report back when I have received more in-depth results following further testing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												9.8/10This is probably one of the best Arcade Kart Racers of all time, and my second favorite behind Crash Team Racing (for nostalgia's sake)This game feels like a cross between Mario Kart and Jak-X with a bit of Star Fox 64 thrown in for good measure, the controls are incredibly snappy and drifting is smoother than a cashmere codpiece. I was worried that much like mario kart, the challenge of the game would dissapate once you have gotten quite proficient at it, but I was pleasently surprised to find that a fourth difficulty is introduced once you get far enough into the game.The Transforming feature of this game I initially assumed to be a gimmick, but in actuality It forms an integral part of what makes this game great; the speedboat style parts have realistic water physics (not to mention that the water looks great too), the flight sections of tracks are well designed so that you dont get lost and the flight physics do not take days to figure out (in fact I picked them up almost instantly [after a little oh the vertical is reversed moment]) unlike some games such as battlefield.The Variety of different game types is pleasant; race, battle race, battle arena, etc. however the time trial style mini games in the world tour such as drift challange and traffic attack (which are good fun) cannot be played on all of the tracks.Four of the 21 tracks in the game are direct ports from the previous game, they are fairly good tracks so I can overlook this, one of these is a paid DLC that comes with metal sonic. Honestly I feel this DLC should have been free, but compared to the other DLCs which are literally just extra characters it makes some sense. So completionists beware, if you really want to get every unlock in the game you will need to spend just under $5.00 extra to get those karts.The Graphics in this game; while its not a super duper high-end eye-gasm inducing system-melting dx11 masterpiece, the visuals are very pleasing, it is seamless and themed well, at times you may see a couple of low-res textures or low-polycount models in the backround, reminding you that this is a console port but nothing that takes away from the playing experience.Oh, Yeah thats right, this is a console port! and before you turn tail and run sceaming to your copy of Crisis 3 and proceeding to clutch it while shivering in the corner; It is a wonderfully optimised port, solid 60fps and absolutley no stuttering, input lag or any other issues often asscosiated with console ports (cough.. cough... Trials Fusion).SEGA have been doing a lot of great ports of late, good job you show 'em how its done!I did own the previous game; Sonic & Sega All Stars Racing on Wii briefly, it was laggy, difficult to control and not at all fun to play, but I suppose thats just down to motion control and >30fps that you get with a wii, but Mario Kart Wii played much better than that, so Idk. The point i'm trying to make is that before purchasing All-Stars Transformed I was highly skeptical of it being any good, and well I guess I couldn't have been more wrong.(Nearly done don't worry, It's a miracle you are still reading now to be fair).If you enjoy Fast Paced Kart Action or just want something more exciting than you average Mario Kart game, I would definately Recommend you buy this game, It is worth the full price on store but if you dont want to shell out, then wait for it to go on sale, I nabbed it for Half Price.Now a Couple of Warnings: - Use a 360 controller, the game is perfectly playable on the keyboard but if you dont have n-key rollover you are gonna run into a couple of problems and inevitable frustration. - The Config menu will not launch from steam (at least for me), you need to go to the game directory and set Launcher.exe to run in compatibility mode for XP sp-3. - The Multiplayer Servers are empty, or at least really quiet, the game is fine with out it, but some acheivement and stickers require you to win online races, so again completionists beware.Now buy it and race me online so I can beat you.I'm not joking,Did you buy it yet?Why are you still reading this?

												Why does Sonic, the Hedgehog capable of supersonic sprints, need a transforming racing vehicle to race? Once you get over the fact that the Character Sprites and Race tracks are purely aesthetic, you can start to appreciate the game's arcade racing-style mechanics with a few modern tweaks, packed together with solid controls that won't leave you shouting ""I TURNED! HOW DID THAT EVEN?"" repeatedly at your screen. If you like racing games, this game is as good as any.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll go ahead and say it: it's the Steam equivalent of a Mario Kart game. Even so, there's enough different about it to set it apart from the tried-and-true formula it's based on. The transformations can be pretty cool to see. The tracks change as you progress through the race, so you may start on the ground, but end in the air. Admittedly, there's a certain excitement to seeing the course crumble around you while you narrowly dodge the projectiles your opponents are spewing. There are plenty of modes and unlockables to keep you occupied for a while, so consider giving it a chance if you like kart racers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you have kids who want to play with you and you are interested in the likes of mario kart then this game is for you, play as a number of characters including wreck it ralph to win the races.    As you race round the tracks your car will transform automatically into a boat or a plane depending on the course, you can pick up powerups to help you win, do tricks which if successful will give you a speed boost and collect stars to use in the slot machine before a race for the chance of a powerup that will last the race. Play single player or split screen multiplayer with the kids or friends, play career mode and unlock more drivers. Everytime you use a car to race it gets xp which unlocks mods for it, fun family entertainment that all ages can enjoy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is what all Sonic racers should have been. It beats Mario Kart in:-Art-Characters-Speed-Tracks-Skill-MusicThings I don't like:- Inability to turn off the menu music but keep the stages';- The annoying announcer telling you what to do every 30 seconds;- Unstable netcode (sometimes);- Unnecessarily long wait times;- Extremely loud splash screen.This didn't keep me from grossing 200+ hours, though.

												I think it's safe to say that this is the best cart game out there and in my opinion the best multiplayer racing game on pc. A variety of players to choose, amazing nintendo-inspired beautiful tracks, three-types of racing in the same game (basically beating the **** out of games based only on that gameplay). You honestly can't ask more from a game of this type. I should also mention that this is a perfect port with no problems like many other games and any gamepad is compatable (no pressure to buy the most expensive gamepad). This will give maany hours of fun and I recommend getting a four-pack whenever you can.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I think that Sonic has had a shaky start with racing games.  Sonic Drift, Sonic R, Riders, and even the previous All Stars racer.  But Transformed is the sonic racer that REALLY defines not only what a Sonic racing game should be, but what should a solid arcade racer is.  Transformed is more of an arcade racer in the vein of classic titles like Daytona USA, OutRun, etc. than a traditional Kart Racer.  Each vehicle in both air, water, and land has it's own distinct feel and responsiveness that really sets the good from the bad aside.  Transformed benefits from a balanced roster, item-list, great level design (if not a bit long), and great respect to the SEGA Brand outside of the weird addition of Danica Patrick.  Is it worth your time?  Yes.  Is it fun as hell?  Yes.  Is Ryo from Shenmue in?  YES. The best godddamn arcade racer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed is, aside from the lengthy name, possibly the most fun I've had in any racing game so far, and despite it being at least somewhat inspired by Mario Kart it still feels original. From what I've seen so far the community is extremely friendly which is always nice to see and just under 2 years later there are groups still activley playing this game every day. It's packed with charming graphics, incredible track/level design and a soundtrack that feels both fresh and nostalgic. It's also full of replay value and if you ever feel like you're becoming uninterested; just watch a track speedrun on YouTube and before you know it you'll have logged another 3 hours on the game.Final score: ★★★★☆ (4/5)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't think it's a bold statement if I say that EVERYONE has had fun time with Mario Kart. At least, I know no person who has had no fun with Mario Kart. I had fun, my lil sis had fun, my parents had fun, my grandparents had fun, all my friends had fun. Mario Kart is FUN. And so is... ahem: ""Sonic and Sega All Star Racing TRANSFORMED"", what's in the name ;)Why the comparisson? Well just look at it, it's a race game featuring game characters from other games (sega and valve) you may or may not know and you have powerups and weapons to pick up and use. Is it a bad thing? Not according to me, this is a good game.It's gameplay gimmick is the Transformed part. Most courses are part driven in a car, part in a boat and part flown in an aircraft! This changes the dynamics quite a bit as you have to manouvre in 3d when you fly, boats respond differently, etc. It works really well and the tracks are well designed.It's just a fun arcade racing game with powerups, boosts, skill and cartoony weapons, nothing more to it. It's fun singleplayer, it's fun but tough online, and even more fun when playing with family and friends in split-screen. The characters you can race with may not be known to some players nowadays. I played both Nintendo SNES and Sega Genesis back in the days. I liked mario, off course, but I like Sonic too. I never was part of any camp. Now Sega has come to my beloved PC and I was happy to see that speeding blue hedgehog and his friends again, even though they haven't had a good game since Sonic-CD besides these racing games. The first character I chose was the ""green dwarf"" I remembered from the game called ""Golden Axe"", I also know ""that taxi driver"" from Crazy Taxi and the ""monkey"" from Monkeyball. But Sega is more of a PC-publisher nowadays and so we get: A Samurai representing Shogun: Total War, a Roman representing Rome: Total War, a Russian general representing Company of Heroes, ""the football manager"" and 3 of the Team Fortress characters!!! It's an acceptable roster for Steam I would say, it has more potential though. I would love to see an even more PC-specific roster, let Sega think outside their own box even more, they could sell this game even better if they put a Dhovakin as a character in it or Shephard, or Gordon Freeman, or a Kerbal, but it's a fun and diverse roster.The game looks beautifull, nice and sharp with vibrant colors. The sound is also what you would expect, it suits the game. And compliments about the music ingame! Funny thing about the menu's though, first of all everytime you boot the game the voice-over pronounces the entire title of the game and he also narrates the choices you make XDI really recommend this game if you hang out with friends to play videogames. It's more fun when you play together, online multiplayer is fun, the singleplayer is also fun, but on-sofa multiplayer is so much more fun! You do need controllers, something we pc-gamers do not tend to have and if we do, we only tend to have one... these are all obstacles, I know. But if you do physically hang out to play games, this game is highly recommended by me. If you know how to fiddle a little tiny bit and want to spend some time doing it, you can make a working controller out of any android phone. It's a solution, the other solution is to buy more controllers.I would score it 7/10 if you are primarily going to play singleplayer or online, 9/10 if you are going to be playing with family and friends which I highly recommend!

												This game is awesome, but if you hear me playing you may well think it's terrible because it sure makes me hurl a lot of abuse at the screen! Make no mistake, this game is HARD!! You can choose your difficulty for every race, but you need stars to unlock things. I have had no problems unlocking things, but I start out on medium and then try for hard (I think I cleared about 2/3 on hard and left the rest on medium so far). If you're more of an easy-maybe-trying-for-medium kind of player, you may end up stuck or frustrated that you can't unlock additional characters.If you do decide to take the plunge, be sure to visit the steam forum page for this game and take a look at the top pinned topic for some awesome tips. You really need to learn how to boost-start and drift to start getting anywhere in the game for instance. The weapons are imaginative and they're not TOO disruptive (there are no ""I win"" weapons), but they're definitely not useless as I saw one reviewer state. The thing is you need to learn to use them, as everything in this game. The game is really designed to be a challenge in every way.There are definitely things to complain about, drifting feels a bit counterintuitive and I have to repress some automatic behaviours from more realistic games, flying is hard to get used to as well and although the weapons are not too bad you can still be 1st for 2 rounds only to then be hit by 5 weapons in a row and end dead last (although I guess this is sort of inherent to the kart racer genre), just to name a few... but what it comes down to is that I keep coming back, it's very addictive.Unfortunately one big drawback is one that Sega can't help much, and that's that the online multiplayer community just isn't very big (at least not anymore now). I've only tried a few times* but once I got to play a couple rounds before a couple players left and there was just me and 2 seasoned pros that I stood absolutely no chance against, the other time there was no ongoing game at all and after waiting around to see if anyone would join me for 10 minutes or so only one person had and they left again. A big plus though is that there is local multiplayer, so if you have the gamepads or someone doesn't mind using the keyboard you can have a sonic racing party in your livingroom. You may have to dial back your own built up skills though if they havent played before or they wont enjoy your company for long ;-) (since the game really does require some practice).* I feel I should mention, I just tried looking for a matchmaking game again tonight and actually ended up in a nearly full game with people near to my rating, so it might just be a matter of playing at the right times.

Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed excels in almost every aspect of the kart racing genre. The drifting feels natural, the tracks are varied, the weapons are interesting and fair, and the boosting mechanics are great fun to exploit. Where it suffers somewhat is in the character selection - Sonic and company are great, but the rest of the roster is padded with significantly less recognizable entries. Overall a well polished kart racer.The games’ mechanics are well thought-out. Everything works well together:* Boosts can be gained from drifting, boost pads, and doing tricks while in mid air. You are rewarded for chaining different types of boosts together, which makes you always on the lookout for trick/drift opportunities.* Weapons are powerful, but they always leave the targeted player with some recourse to deal with them. All automatically tracking weapons can be boosted away from if timed correctly, and nearly all other weapons can be dodged in some way.* Tracks are dynamic and sometimes will change from lap to lap. Tracks generally will have different paths to choose from, each offering either extra boosts, extra trick jumps/drifts, or extra weapon pickups.Kart racing games are often a party game, and this is where Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed might fall short for you. The fact is most people are familiar with Mario Kart. Plumbers, princesses and shells are recognizable to the casual gamer and that familiarity can make a game much easier to get in to. Sonic Racing's monkeys, fireworks and pufferfish aren't as familiar to people, and until a player gets a feel for how the world and the weapons work the well-crafted mechanics will be lost on them.Still, the bottom line is that it feels good to drive your boat/plane/car around; flipping, drifting, boosting and shooting your way to victory. Recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Why does Sonic, the Hedgehog capable of supersonic sprints, need a transforming racing vehicle to race? Once you get over the fact that the Character Sprites and Race tracks are purely aesthetic, you can start to appreciate the game's arcade racing-style mechanics with a few modern tweaks, packed together with solid controls that won't leave you shouting ""I TURNED! HOW DID THAT EVEN?"" repeatedly at your screen. If you like racing games, this game is as good as any.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The campaign is filled with other types of races and time trial-type races, which make the game more interesting. The tracks are amazing, changing their structure after each lap. The transformation aspect of this game is very unique and pulled off very well. This is a great racing game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed (SART) is a sequel to Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing (SSAR), an arcade kart racing game that includes many characters and tracks from Sega titles, this one made by Sumo and released on PC in 2013. So yep, racing around competively, drifting and picking up random weapons to use on opponents.It also got Xbox 360, PS3, WiiU, PSVita and 3DS versions as far as I am aware. And PC version actually got a bunch of exclusive characters (and exclusive DLC), like General Winter. Other versions weren't strangers to cameos from non-Sega franchises either. Though the only ones you miss are Avatar-using racers from Xbox 360 and WiiU. So be happy, you probably got the best version.It also had a ""bonus edition"" version for consoles which included Metal Sonic, OutRun stage and bonus stickers. It then became the first DLC.Multiplayer seems to be slightly alive. It's hard to say without server browser, it's only matchmaking. At least at my European evening I got into racing match with 6 more players, so it must be quite good, even though I didn't get into any others. Just once. Maybe just a small bunch of people playing. Maybe none in other modes other than race.Eh, actually that sounds pretty bad. But hey, some say that Matchmaking is tied to region that you set in your Steam download. Worst idea ever.I think that you can play in local multiplayer, where you can actually beat some single-player missions with friend. I heard. Didn't check yet.Original Racing was a simple kart game for it's time, most notably for being on PC and for having Sega fan-service. And fun. It was easy to learn and easy to master.Transformed on other hands was THE thing at the time of release. The transforming aspect gave a new twist for the genre and the boost mechanic was much more complex. It was was objectively outdoing Mario Kart at the time of release. Even though I didn't play Kart. Must be Mario Andretti Racing spin-off game. Anyway, it's now hard to learn and harder to master too, delighting more hardcore gaming and fans of Sega racing games.And well, because of transformation, cars that characters drive were standarized, no more separation into bikes, cars and flying cars.Transforming now divides racing into three sections: Air, Land and Water. It controls almost same on Land, but now boost mechanics were improved. You now can quickly change directions while drifting and keep building up the boost, even though the current progress to the next boost level will be reset. And this time it will be unwise to try to build boost on a straight road. Not only that, but boosts can be combined with each other. Riding over boosting arrows, using boost powerup and releasing drift boost in same time as they are active will give you a huge boost points. You can also do rolling/flipping while in air to get boost when you land.And well, that's why you need a gamepad.Sea sections are similar, though they are a bit more slippery. Actually, it has water physics, so if you are good, you may even figure out on which wave/ripple you should roll to get boost.Air section takes you on the fast plane, which has a bit less responsible controls and will take a while to learn. Rolling here will slow you down, BUT you can get a risk boost this way if you rolled away from collision with some objects, like columns or wall. Though, it doesn't work on every object, so you will have to learn.Weapons were changed as well to make it feel more fair. They look weird, yet more inspired. If it's something auto-aiming then you can dodge it by boosting in the right moment. It has unique anti-first-place weapon that doesn't feel cheap. It creates a swarm of bees Badnicks in front of a racers for a while between which you have to dodge. But then, good players who are way ahead of main mass will remain unchallenged if they know how to dodge that, while main mass it busy punching each other, so to say.But we all know what is the most important question that we must ask. Does this jolly Sega racing all-star game have Segata Sanshiro?No, it doesn't.BUT it has Joe Mushashi who is about as cool!AND it has Shinobi stage. AND yesssssss, it comes with Shinobi 3 music track, which is the best character out of all that racing karts ever had!I am so sorry Segata Sanshiro, but as much as I love Saturn, Idaten is still my favourite waifu.And yes, Sega fan-service is great in this one. Less focused on Sonic franchise, as lovely as that one is, and with more of classic Sega. And cameos. Like characters from RTS games on PC that Sega is currently publishing. Hooray and oora for General Winter and his drifting tank. And even not-related characters made cameo, like Ralph. Or Danica Patrick, which didn't seem out of place because I was thinking that it must be reference to either Monaco GP or Virtua Racing. But nope, NASCAR. And I mean, you know that this is some seriously awesome AAA Racing game when even Valve would come along and beg for their Team Fortress character to be in Sonic Racing Transformed game instead of another way around, so their Team Fortress 2 game will get some recognition from Sega players. Even though most players feel weird over different voice actors.Anyway, character selection is great and mighty. They are quite balanced around in stats, not being different otherwise, though community still divides them into different tier. And characters with low-speed will struggle on stages with more straight design. But if you like character but not stats, then you can just keep playing and then unlock mods as you level up, which usually take one point from one stat and give to another one. Also, unique All-Star powers for each character became simpler and more mundane, mostly to balance them out and make them more fair and standartized in multiplayer, I guess.  Since they weren't usable in multiplayer in original. Still, less fun. But hey, look, there is Gillius Thunderhead right behind you!Just a bit less than half of a characters will be locked away and must be unlocked by playing World Tour, beating stages, which give different amount of stars depending on difficulty, and then getting enough to be able to get new characters. It does give you reason to play the nice single-player campaign of sorts, which keeps giving different missions and tracks. Instead of shopping based on coins you get in each race like in original. It also means that most players will never get to play as Eggman or Gillius Thunderhead, as to get those, you must play at harder difficulty. And AI is already hard challenging nasties. But fun.Stages are awesome and fan-servicy as well. Less Sonic too. More of random awesome. I mean, it has freaking Burning Rangers stage! And After Burner! And... You get it. Not only that, but some tracks also change layouts for each lap, like a ground gets destroyed and from now on you are flying in this part.But really, this is some AAA Kart Racing game on Steam, can't go wrong with it. It will keep you busy for a while. And even happy, because Sega magic!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Got this from the humble Sega bundle recently, originally for (hoping for, and later on became true) Sonic Generations. I have always liked racing games in general and the Mario Kart series. I went into this game not expecting much... boy was I wrong.Being honest, at first, I couldn't see how this game was good despite hearing that it was. The drifting felt strange as a Mario Kart player. The speed boosts obtained didn't seem very significant. I couldn't beat the 2nd hardest difficulty for my first session or so in the game... and this was early on in the ""world tour"" mode.Then, I tried time attack for the first time. I was initially disappointed by how you were only able to do one of the three laps in a normal race; I wanted to run the full 3 laps. However, in the end, I've come to accept it as okay.Anyway, I saw one of the top ghosts going unbelievably fast (to this very moment, I feel mostly certain about it being a cheat of sorts). So I tried getting better. After easily beating the ""medium"" ghost, I saw the hard ghost as my goal. After some struggling, I beat that, and... an expert ghost comes out. While not nearly as fast as the top lap times, I could not keep up.The game had more things for me to learn than I thought. On top of track layout, there are things like: Switching drift direction mid-chain. Air tricks. Transform boosts. Utilizing the small hops in the terrain/water as a car/boat for an extra trick, while drifting. Risk boosts in a plane. Boost levels beyond the stated 3 from drifting. Using a boost/drift boost to evade the remote control item. Holding drifts or not drifting on certain parts of tracks for more speed than if I let go of a boost. Being able to drift while not holding the accelerator to make tighter turns. Those are the things I learned in my 28 hours according to steam, 20 hours in game time ""journey"". In that order as well.As a fan of racing and going fast, all this was a grand learning experience. The tracks are very good overall; I loved how each lap could (and usually are) a different experience. It's a shame they even brought back 4 old tracks (20 total) from the previous iteration of this game where there's only a car section. Those are by far my least favorite tracks, since they feel so bland and boring.It's also a shame there are only 20 tracks too (1 more if you count DLC I believe). (No I don't count mirror versions). The 16 tracks that nearly all change each lap are amazing to go through the first time. Then, after learning all their intricate details, maximizing your speed in each is great fun. They are all beautiful and fairly colorful. I want more; double that. Sumo entertainment (makers of this game) can make great tracks.That doesn't even touch on the actual game experience as a whole. World Tour, the ""main"" mode features a variety of race types to help get you to understand the game's mechanics. From regular races with items, boost-only races, shooting at a tank, and dumbed down time attack ghosts, there's a lot to go through. You don't even unlock the ability to do the hardest difficulty until you complete most of the mode in the first place. This is a mostly good thing to me at least. I definitely would not have had any chance of winning had I not learned from struggling with the 2nd hardest difficulty.You unlock nearly all characters from World Tour mode as well. For a grand total of 23 (no DLC), each feels similar enough as a whole, but each one really does have slightly different characteristics... even if 2 characters stats are the same. As you use each character, they can ""level up"" to obtain mods, which alter their stats a bit. The best ones, especially when you play the game seriously, are locked behind obtaining the max level and/or progressing in World Tour though. You likely won't set great time attack records without them. This is a mostly good thing, but I feel the unlocks for the best mods should not always have been last.Then there's your standard grand prix mode. Since I completed the vast majority of world tour on the hardest difficulty before touching grand prix, grand prix wasn't so bad. However, the computers definitely cheat. You cannot outrun them no matter how fast you are versus the world. They also will throw items at you at bad times in most cases. A lot of the time, you will have to shoot the cpu ahead of you just before crossing the finish line to obtain first place. Mercifully, the AI does seem to have leeway on which one is ""fast"" for the race, so you can still take 1st overall if you just race well.Speaking of items, they're very standard and a lot less powerful than in other games of this type (...well, Mario Kart series). They work in a close/relatively close race, but if one gets far enough ahead, hardly any items will be able to stop  a player from racing as well as they can. Great in single player (not that you'll ever be able to utilize that since they cheat), but multiplayer kind of suffers from it.Multiplayer has some players, but not much. It's not the most fleshed out option. It's also an older game now, so that's expected. It's kind of a slow process overall, but the races run more smoothly than expected even if someone else has a seemingly worse connection. Sadly, the largest race I've been in only consisted of about 6 players. I got into a lobby that was full, only to have the game crash before the race started. While it was fun, it doesn't have much longevity. Now that I am proficient at all tracks, skill/track knowledge makes a rather large difference in how well you do online. As mentioned previously, only a couple items, if that, can affect a far-ahead front runner. With a large enough lead, the leader will most likely keep extending it if racers behind don't have the skill to keep/catch up.The only truly negative aspect of this game, if that, would be some silly achievements. Having 4 people play locally is out of the question, given the lack of controllers/keyboards/usb ports. Investing more money just for that would be silly. Then there's luck based things, like hitting from a long distance. I wish to 100% achievement the game (as I've 101% completed the game), but they really add nothing to the experience.Overall, for how cheap I personally got this game, it's a great purchase with enough surface allure and depth to keep you playing, should you choose to get into it. I would definitely have paid a bit more for it (I'm a cheap gamer nowadays). It's a somewhat old game now, but it's definitely worth your time to check out if you're a fan of racing.

												I don't think it's a bold statement if I say that EVERYONE has had fun time with Mario Kart. At least, I know no person who has had no fun with Mario Kart. I had fun, my lil sis had fun, my parents had fun, my grandparents had fun, all my friends had fun. Mario Kart is FUN. And so is... ahem: ""Sonic and Sega All Star Racing TRANSFORMED"", what's in the name ;)Why the comparisson? Well just look at it, it's a race game featuring game characters from other games (sega and valve) you may or may not know and you have powerups and weapons to pick up and use. Is it a bad thing? Not according to me, this is a good game.It's gameplay gimmick is the Transformed part. Most courses are part driven in a car, part in a boat and part flown in an aircraft! This changes the dynamics quite a bit as you have to manouvre in 3d when you fly, boats respond differently, etc. It works really well and the tracks are well designed.It's just a fun arcade racing game with powerups, boosts, skill and cartoony weapons, nothing more to it. It's fun singleplayer, it's fun but tough online, and even more fun when playing with family and friends in split-screen. The characters you can race with may not be known to some players nowadays. I played both Nintendo SNES and Sega Genesis back in the days. I liked mario, off course, but I like Sonic too. I never was part of any camp. Now Sega has come to my beloved PC and I was happy to see that speeding blue hedgehog and his friends again, even though they haven't had a good game since Sonic-CD besides these racing games. The first character I chose was the ""green dwarf"" I remembered from the game called ""Golden Axe"", I also know ""that taxi driver"" from Crazy Taxi and the ""monkey"" from Monkeyball. But Sega is more of a PC-publisher nowadays and so we get: A Samurai representing Shogun: Total War, a Roman representing Rome: Total War, a Russian general representing Company of Heroes, ""the football manager"" and 3 of the Team Fortress characters!!! It's an acceptable roster for Steam I would say, it has more potential though. I would love to see an even more PC-specific roster, let Sega think outside their own box even more, they could sell this game even better if they put a Dhovakin as a character in it or Shephard, or Gordon Freeman, or a Kerbal, but it's a fun and diverse roster.The game looks beautifull, nice and sharp with vibrant colors. The sound is also what you would expect, it suits the game. And compliments about the music ingame! Funny thing about the menu's though, first of all everytime you boot the game the voice-over pronounces the entire title of the game and he also narrates the choices you make XDI really recommend this game if you hang out with friends to play videogames. It's more fun when you play together, online multiplayer is fun, the singleplayer is also fun, but on-sofa multiplayer is so much more fun! You do need controllers, something we pc-gamers do not tend to have and if we do, we only tend to have one... these are all obstacles, I know. But if you do physically hang out to play games, this game is highly recommended by me. If you know how to fiddle a little tiny bit and want to spend some time doing it, you can make a working controller out of any android phone. It's a solution, the other solution is to buy more controllers.I would score it 7/10 if you are primarily going to play singleplayer or online, 9/10 if you are going to be playing with family and friends which I highly recommend!

												This game is awesome, but if you hear me playing you may well think it's terrible because it sure makes me hurl a lot of abuse at the screen! Make no mistake, this game is HARD!! You can choose your difficulty for every race, but you need stars to unlock things. I have had no problems unlocking things, but I start out on medium and then try for hard (I think I cleared about 2/3 on hard and left the rest on medium so far). If you're more of an easy-maybe-trying-for-medium kind of player, you may end up stuck or frustrated that you can't unlock additional characters.If you do decide to take the plunge, be sure to visit the steam forum page for this game and take a look at the top pinned topic for some awesome tips. You really need to learn how to boost-start and drift to start getting anywhere in the game for instance. The weapons are imaginative and they're not TOO disruptive (there are no ""I win"" weapons), but they're definitely not useless as I saw one reviewer state. The thing is you need to learn to use them, as everything in this game. The game is really designed to be a challenge in every way.There are definitely things to complain about, drifting feels a bit counterintuitive and I have to repress some automatic behaviours from more realistic games, flying is hard to get used to as well and although the weapons are not too bad you can still be 1st for 2 rounds only to then be hit by 5 weapons in a row and end dead last (although I guess this is sort of inherent to the kart racer genre), just to name a few... but what it comes down to is that I keep coming back, it's very addictive.Unfortunately one big drawback is one that Sega can't help much, and that's that the online multiplayer community just isn't very big (at least not anymore now). I've only tried a few times* but once I got to play a couple rounds before a couple players left and there was just me and 2 seasoned pros that I stood absolutely no chance against, the other time there was no ongoing game at all and after waiting around to see if anyone would join me for 10 minutes or so only one person had and they left again. A big plus though is that there is local multiplayer, so if you have the gamepads or someone doesn't mind using the keyboard you can have a sonic racing party in your livingroom. You may have to dial back your own built up skills though if they havent played before or they wont enjoy your company for long ;-) (since the game really does require some practice).* I feel I should mention, I just tried looking for a matchmaking game again tonight and actually ended up in a nearly full game with people near to my rating, so it might just be a matter of playing at the right times.

Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed excels in almost every aspect of the kart racing genre. The drifting feels natural, the tracks are varied, the weapons are interesting and fair, and the boosting mechanics are great fun to exploit. Where it suffers somewhat is in the character selection - Sonic and company are great, but the rest of the roster is padded with significantly less recognizable entries. Overall a well polished kart racer.The games’ mechanics are well thought-out. Everything works well together:* Boosts can be gained from drifting, boost pads, and doing tricks while in mid air. You are rewarded for chaining different types of boosts together, which makes you always on the lookout for trick/drift opportunities.* Weapons are powerful, but they always leave the targeted player with some recourse to deal with them. All automatically tracking weapons can be boosted away from if timed correctly, and nearly all other weapons can be dodged in some way.* Tracks are dynamic and sometimes will change from lap to lap. Tracks generally will have different paths to choose from, each offering either extra boosts, extra trick jumps/drifts, or extra weapon pickups.Kart racing games are often a party game, and this is where Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed might fall short for you. The fact is most people are familiar with Mario Kart. Plumbers, princesses and shells are recognizable to the casual gamer and that familiarity can make a game much easier to get in to. Sonic Racing's monkeys, fireworks and pufferfish aren't as familiar to people, and until a player gets a feel for how the world and the weapons work the well-crafted mechanics will be lost on them.Still, the bottom line is that it feels good to drive your boat/plane/car around; flipping, drifting, boosting and shooting your way to victory. Recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If anyone of you has ever played Mario Kart or Crash Team Racing and liked it - you'll definitely love this one and I can guarantee that!While you keep playing, you can unlock 26 characters in total and you have lots of different kind of levels to play through! When other racing games go only by bikes and go-karts, in S&ASRT you can drive cars, bikes, boats and planes as soon as the environment changes.The game itself is not different from other racing games but it gives you an energic boost when you get into it - all the maps, views, the way the environment goes crazy and the soundtracks. You just can't do anything else but to love it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Coming from a long history of playing Mario Kart, this game is refreshingly similar but includes some distinctive features. For once, AI don't finish in the same order in every damn race. Then there is the career mode (one by one vs. cups of 4) and the unlocking through progress. Last but not least there are similarities such as drifting (snake technique?).The biggest feature - the transformation into ships and planes - goes along with a change in physics and balancing which is great.Overall, the single player is much less frustrating than expected. There are so many different race modes! Time Attacks, Ring Races, Drift Challenges, Speed Challenges, races without weapons... From what I can see, this is the best Mario Kart availalble for PC and it might even beat it on any platform because of the track variety and different race modes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At first, everyone was making fun of Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing because it looked like a Mario Kart rip-off. Now, because of the three vehicule types gameplay, people are comparing it to Diddy Kong Racing. Compare this game as much as you want, it's still one of the greatest arcade racing game of the past 10 years and also one of the best kart racers of all time. With an all-star cast featuring characters from the Sonic franchise, underground franchises like Jet Set Radio and Super Monkey Ball and characters from other games such as the crew from Team Fortress 2 and General Winter from Company Of Heroes 2, this game is an absolute blast. The team behind this game is composed of many members from other developers who made games such as Project Gotham Racing, Blur and Split/Second. It's an amazing game, packed with alot of tracks, missions, a career mode that is awesome and the replay value is sky high. An absolute must for anyone who likes racing, Sonic or SEGA in general.

As you race round the tracks your car will transform automatically into a boat or a plane depending on the course, you can pick up powerups to help you win, do tricks which if successful will give you a speed boost and collect stars to use in the slot machine before a race for the chance of a powerup that will last the race. Play single player or split screen multiplayer with the kids or friends, play career mode and unlock more drivers. Everytime you use a car to race it gets xp which unlocks mods for it, fun family entertainment that all ages can enjoy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll go ahead and say it: it's the Steam equivalent of a Mario Kart game. Even so, there's enough different about it to set it apart from the tried-and-true formula it's based on. The transformations can be pretty cool to see. The tracks change as you progress through the race, so you may start on the ground, but end in the air. Admittedly, there's a certain excitement to seeing the course crumble around you while you narrowly dodge the projectiles your opponents are spewing. There are plenty of modes and unlockables to keep you occupied for a while, so consider giving it a chance if you like kart racers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed (SART) is a sequel to Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing (SSAR), an arcade kart racing game that includes many characters and tracks from Sega titles, this one made by Sumo and released on PC in 2013. So yep, racing around competively, drifting and picking up random weapons to use on opponents.It also got Xbox 360, PS3, WiiU, PSVita and 3DS versions as far as I am aware. And PC version actually got a bunch of exclusive characters (and exclusive DLC), like General Winter. Other versions weren't strangers to cameos from non-Sega franchises either. Though the only ones you miss are Avatar-using racers from Xbox 360 and WiiU. So be happy, you probably got the best version.It also had a ""bonus edition"" version for consoles which included Metal Sonic, OutRun stage and bonus stickers. It then became the first DLC.Multiplayer seems to be slightly alive. It's hard to say without server browser, it's only matchmaking. At least at my European evening I got into racing match with 6 more players, so it must be quite good, even though I didn't get into any others. Just once. Maybe just a small bunch of people playing. Maybe none in other modes other than race.Eh, actually that sounds pretty bad. But hey, some say that Matchmaking is tied to region that you set in your Steam download. Worst idea ever.I think that you can play in local multiplayer, where you can actually beat some single-player missions with friend. I heard. Didn't check yet.Original Racing was a simple kart game for it's time, most notably for being on PC and for having Sega fan-service. And fun. It was easy to learn and easy to master.Transformed on other hands was THE thing at the time of release. The transforming aspect gave a new twist for the genre and the boost mechanic was much more complex. It was was objectively outdoing Mario Kart at the time of release. Even though I didn't play Kart. Must be Mario Andretti Racing spin-off game. Anyway, it's now hard to learn and harder to master too, delighting more hardcore gaming and fans of Sega racing games.And well, because of transformation, cars that characters drive were standarized, no more separation into bikes, cars and flying cars.Transforming now divides racing into three sections: Air, Land and Water. It controls almost same on Land, but now boost mechanics were improved. You now can quickly change directions while drifting and keep building up the boost, even though the current progress to the next boost level will be reset. And this time it will be unwise to try to build boost on a straight road. Not only that, but boosts can be combined with each other. Riding over boosting arrows, using boost powerup and releasing drift boost in same time as they are active will give you a huge boost points. You can also do rolling/flipping while in air to get boost when you land.And well, that's why you need a gamepad.Sea sections are similar, though they are a bit more slippery. Actually, it has water physics, so if you are good, you may even figure out on which wave/ripple you should roll to get boost.Air section takes you on the fast plane, which has a bit less responsible controls and will take a while to learn. Rolling here will slow you down, BUT you can get a risk boost this way if you rolled away from collision with some objects, like columns or wall. Though, it doesn't work on every object, so you will have to learn.Weapons were changed as well to make it feel more fair. They look weird, yet more inspired. If it's something auto-aiming then you can dodge it by boosting in the right moment. It has unique anti-first-place weapon that doesn't feel cheap. It creates a swarm of bees Badnicks in front of a racers for a while between which you have to dodge. But then, good players who are way ahead of main mass will remain unchallenged if they know how to dodge that, while main mass it busy punching each other, so to say.But we all know what is the most important question that we must ask. Does this jolly Sega racing all-star game have Segata Sanshiro?No, it doesn't.BUT it has Joe Mushashi who is about as cool!AND it has Shinobi stage. AND yesssssss, it comes with Shinobi 3 music track, which is the best character out of all that racing karts ever had!I am so sorry Segata Sanshiro, but as much as I love Saturn, Idaten is still my favourite waifu.And yes, Sega fan-service is great in this one. Less focused on Sonic franchise, as lovely as that one is, and with more of classic Sega. And cameos. Like characters from RTS games on PC that Sega is currently publishing. Hooray and oora for General Winter and his drifting tank. And even not-related characters made cameo, like Ralph. Or Danica Patrick, which didn't seem out of place because I was thinking that it must be reference to either Monaco GP or Virtua Racing. But nope, NASCAR. And I mean, you know that this is some seriously awesome AAA Racing game when even Valve would come along and beg for their Team Fortress character to be in Sonic Racing Transformed game instead of another way around, so their Team Fortress 2 game will get some recognition from Sega players. Even though most players feel weird over different voice actors.Anyway, character selection is great and mighty. They are quite balanced around in stats, not being different otherwise, though community still divides them into different tier. And characters with low-speed will struggle on stages with more straight design. But if you like character but not stats, then you can just keep playing and then unlock mods as you level up, which usually take one point from one stat and give to another one. Also, unique All-Star powers for each character became simpler and more mundane, mostly to balance them out and make them more fair and standartized in multiplayer, I guess.  Since they weren't usable in multiplayer in original. Still, less fun. But hey, look, there is Gillius Thunderhead right behind you!Just a bit less than half of a characters will be locked away and must be unlocked by playing World Tour, beating stages, which give different amount of stars depending on difficulty, and then getting enough to be able to get new characters. It does give you reason to play the nice single-player campaign of sorts, which keeps giving different missions and tracks. Instead of shopping based on coins you get in each race like in original. It also means that most players will never get to play as Eggman or Gillius Thunderhead, as to get those, you must play at harder difficulty. And AI is already hard challenging nasties. But fun.Stages are awesome and fan-servicy as well. Less Sonic too. More of random awesome. I mean, it has freaking Burning Rangers stage! And After Burner! And... You get it. Not only that, but some tracks also change layouts for each lap, like a ground gets destroyed and from now on you are flying in this part.But really, this is some AAA Kart Racing game on Steam, can't go wrong with it. It will keep you busy for a while. And even happy, because Sega magic!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed (SART) is a sequel to Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing (SSAR), an arcade kart racing game that includes many characters and tracks from Sega titles, this one made by Sumo and released on PC in 2013. So yep, racing around competively, drifting and picking up random weapons to use on opponents.It also got Xbox 360, PS3, WiiU, PSVita and 3DS versions as far as I am aware. And PC version actually got a bunch of exclusive characters (and exclusive DLC), like General Winter. Other versions weren't strangers to cameos from non-Sega franchises either. Though the only ones you miss are Avatar-using racers from Xbox 360 and WiiU. So be happy, you probably got the best version.It also had a ""bonus edition"" version for consoles which included Metal Sonic, OutRun stage and bonus stickers. It then became the first DLC.Multiplayer seems to be slightly alive. It's hard to say without server browser, it's only matchmaking. At least at my European evening I got into racing match with 6 more players, so it must be quite good, even though I didn't get into any others. Just once. Maybe just a small bunch of people playing. Maybe none in other modes other than race.Eh, actually that sounds pretty bad. But hey, some say that Matchmaking is tied to region that you set in your Steam download. Worst idea ever.I think that you can play in local multiplayer, where you can actually beat some single-player missions with friend. I heard. Didn't check yet.Original Racing was a simple kart game for it's time, most notably for being on PC and for having Sega fan-service. And fun. It was easy to learn and easy to master.Transformed on other hands was THE thing at the time of release. The transforming aspect gave a new twist for the genre and the boost mechanic was much more complex. It was was objectively outdoing Mario Kart at the time of release. Even though I didn't play Kart. Must be Mario Andretti Racing spin-off game. Anyway, it's now hard to learn and harder to master too, delighting more hardcore gaming and fans of Sega racing games.And well, because of transformation, cars that characters drive were standarized, no more separation into bikes, cars and flying cars.Transforming now divides racing into three sections: Air, Land and Water. It controls almost same on Land, but now boost mechanics were improved. You now can quickly change directions while drifting and keep building up the boost, even though the current progress to the next boost level will be reset. And this time it will be unwise to try to build boost on a straight road. Not only that, but boosts can be combined with each other. Riding over boosting arrows, using boost powerup and releasing drift boost in same time as they are active will give you a huge boost points. You can also do rolling/flipping while in air to get boost when you land.And well, that's why you need a gamepad.Sea sections are similar, though they are a bit more slippery.

												Got this from the humble Sega bundle recently, originally for (hoping for, and later on became true) Sonic Generations. I have always liked racing games in general and the Mario Kart series. I went into this game not expecting much... boy was I wrong.Being honest, at first, I couldn't see how this game was good despite hearing that it was. The drifting felt strange as a Mario Kart player. The speed boosts obtained didn't seem very significant. I couldn't beat the 2nd hardest difficulty for my first session or so in the game... and this was early on in the ""world tour"" mode.Then, I tried time attack for the first time. I was initially disappointed by how you were only able to do one of the three laps in a normal race; I wanted to run the full 3 laps. However, in the end, I've come to accept it as okay.Anyway, I saw one of the top ghosts going unbelievably fast (to this very moment, I feel mostly certain about it being a cheat of sorts). So I tried getting better. After easily beating the ""medium"" ghost, I saw the hard ghost as my goal. After some struggling, I beat that, and... an expert ghost comes out. While not nearly as fast as the top lap times, I could not keep up.The game had more things for me to learn than I thought. On top of track layout, there are things like: Switching drift direction mid-chain. Air tricks. Transform boosts. Utilizing the small hops in the terrain/water as a car/boat for an extra trick, while drifting. Risk boosts in a plane. Boost levels beyond the stated 3 from drifting. Using a boost/drift boost to evade the remote control item. Holding drifts or not drifting on certain parts of tracks for more speed than if I let go of a boost. Being able to drift while not holding the accelerator to make tighter turns. Those are the things I learned in my 28 hours according to steam, 20 hours in game time ""journey"". In that order as well.As a fan of racing and going fast, all this was a grand learning experience. The tracks are very good overall; I loved how each lap could (and usually are) a different experience. It's a shame they even brought back 4 old tracks (20 total) from the previous iteration of this game where there's only a car section. Those are by far my least favorite tracks, since they feel so bland and boring.It's also a shame there are only 20 tracks too (1 more if you count DLC I believe). (No I don't count mirror versions). The 16 tracks that nearly all change each lap are amazing to go through the first time. Then, after learning all their intricate details, maximizing your speed in each is great fun. They are all beautiful and fairly colorful. I want more; double that. Sumo entertainment (makers of this game) can make great tracks.That doesn't even touch on the actual game experience as a whole. World Tour, the ""main"" mode features a variety of race types to help get you to understand the game's mechanics. From regular races with items, boost-only races, shooting at a tank, and dumbed down time attack ghosts, there's a lot to go through. You don't even unlock the ability to do the hardest difficulty until you complete most of the mode in the first place. This is a mostly good thing to me at least. I definitely would not have had any chance of winning had I not learned from struggling with the 2nd hardest difficulty.You unlock nearly all characters from World Tour mode as well. For a grand total of 23 (no DLC), each feels similar enough as a whole, but each one really does have slightly different characteristics... even if 2 characters stats are the same. As you use each character, they can ""level up"" to obtain mods, which alter their stats a bit. The best ones, especially when you play the game seriously, are locked behind obtaining the max level and/or progressing in World Tour though. You likely won't set great time attack records without them. This is a mostly good thing, but I feel the unlocks for the best mods should not always have been last.Then there's your standard grand prix mode. Since I completed the vast majority of world tour on the hardest difficulty before touching grand prix, grand prix wasn't so bad. However, the computers definitely cheat. You cannot outrun them no matter how fast you are versus the world. They also will throw items at you at bad times in most cases. A lot of the time, you will have to shoot the cpu ahead of you just before crossing the finish line to obtain first place. Mercifully, the AI does seem to have leeway on which one is ""fast"" for the race, so you can still take 1st overall if you just race well.Speaking of items, they're very standard and a lot less powerful than in other games of this type (...well, Mario Kart series). They work in a close/relatively close race, but if one gets far enough ahead, hardly any items will be able to stop  a player from racing as well as they can. Great in single player (not that you'll ever be able to utilize that since they cheat), but multiplayer kind of suffers from it.Multiplayer has some players, but not much. It's not the most fleshed out option. It's also an older game now, so that's expected. It's kind of a slow process overall, but the races run more smoothly than expected even if someone else has a seemingly worse connection. Sadly, the largest race I've been in only consisted of about 6 players. I got into a lobby that was full, only to have the game crash before the race started. While it was fun, it doesn't have much longevity. Now that I am proficient at all tracks, skill/track knowledge makes a rather large difference in how well you do online. As mentioned previously, only a couple items, if that, can affect a far-ahead front runner. With a large enough lead, the leader will most likely keep extending it if racers behind don't have the skill to keep/catch up.The only truly negative aspect of this game, if that, would be some silly achievements. Having 4 people play locally is out of the question, given the lack of controllers/keyboards/usb ports. Investing more money just for that would be silly. Then there's luck based things, like hitting from a long distance. I wish to 100% achievement the game (as I've 101% completed the game), but they really add nothing to the experience.Overall, for how cheap I personally got this game, it's a great purchase with enough surface allure and depth to keep you playing, should you choose to get into it. I would definitely have paid a bit more for it (I'm a cheap gamer nowadays). It's a somewhat old game now, but it's definitely worth your time to check out if you're a fan of racing.

												You might take one look at Sonic & ALL-Stars Racing Transformed and see it as a Mario Kart knock off. While they are similar, I would say this game borrows more elements from Diddy Kong Racing on the N64. Both these games feature hovercrafts, airplanes, and karts. The difference with this title is that the vehicles transform between all of these within each course. And might I add that the courses look spectacular! Not only that, but they are actually really well designed. Each course is filled with nods of nostalgia if you ever owned a Master System, Genesis, Saturn, Dreamcast, or any Sega game. The music is brilliantly catchy consisting of remixed SEGA tunes from previous catalogs. It's obviously not Mario Kart and lacks the eggshells, invincibility stars, The Mushroom Kingdom, etc. This is SEGA so it's all Sonic galore. Thankfully, this game isn't based soley on characters from the Sonic universe and most of the disliked characters from the series are NOT included. In return, this game mixes characters from other Sega games such as NiGHTs, Alex Kidd, and Beat from Jet Set Radio. Most of the included characters aren't even popular Sega characters, but the fact they have been included is total fan service. Surprisingly, this game is actually fun and REALLY REALLY fast. It's both addictive and challenging with tons of unlockables. And it sports online play with voice communication! Sadly, most will compare this to Mario Kart and shove it off as knock off. The reality is that Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed actually gives Mario Kart a run for it's money. Thus, it's sort of like picking between apples and oranges and in this case, it just becomes a Sega does what NintenDONT. (Just had to say it.)In conclusion, this is one of the best Sega games I've played in recent years. Go figure it was made by Sumo Digital, a second party studio outside of SEGA. In theory, maybe Sega should hire them more often. Anyway, despite the brilliance of this kart racer it does have a few flaws. It certainly lacks that Nintendo polish you see in the Mario Kart series. There are a couple of nasty bugs (mostly in online mode) that do appear out of no where. A patch could really do this game well. Other than that, I'd say it's almost comparable to Mario Kart, maybe some aspects even better than Mario Kart. This game is a perfect solution for those who don't own a Nintendo Platform, but are desperately craving a kart racer, and a good one at that! If you own a Wii U, this is the game you bought while you waited for Mario Kart 8. Some have even argued that Nintendo should have borrowed some elements from Transformed. Transformed is better than nothing, but it's even better if you are a fan of Sega and familar with their back catalog of games.  In short, it's Diddy Kong Racing on steroids, but with Sonic and Sega characters instead. It even has a couple of monkeys from the Super Monkey ball games...that's close enough to Diddy. Don't be fooled by Sega's mediocrity of the past. This game belongs in the top 5 kart racers list. Right up there Crash Team Racing, Diddy Kong Racing, and Mario Kart.OVERALL:+ Good visuals, catchy tunes, fun gameplay-  A few nasty bugs-  Hovercraft can be hard to control. (No different to DKR on N64)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll go ahead and say it: it's the Steam equivalent of a Mario Kart game. Even so, there's enough different about it to set it apart from the tried-and-true formula it's based on. The transformations can be pretty cool to see. The tracks change as you progress through the race, so you may start on the ground, but end in the air. Admittedly, there's a certain excitement to seeing the course crumble around you while you narrowly dodge the projectiles your opponents are spewing. There are plenty of modes and unlockables to keep you occupied for a while, so consider giving it a chance if you like kart racers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a cart racer similar to Mario Kart or Crash Team Racing. This game is pretty fun the way stages will change based on whatever lap you're on. The ground can shatter, the road can end going into an ocean... or you can launch off an air carrier and race in the middle of a massive dog fight.. it all depends on the stage. The changes are scripted and are the same each time but still it adds a fun dynamic to what otherwise would have been a standard kart racing game. Your kart can transform into a speed boat or a flying machine depending on what happens in the game. Winning is based more on how well you can handle your vehicle and how well you can drift-boost. You can also dodge attacks with speed boost making the game more skill based than luck based. Being farther in the back makes the chance of getting a greater item higher. Being in front however doesn't mean you'll be denied ultimate attacks. You have a chance of getting your ultimate ""All-Star"" item even in first place. This game really did keep my attention for quite a while. I put about 30 hours into it playing the Grand Prix mode in easy, normal hard and expert. Trust me when I say this. ""Normal"" is the old Sonic Racing ""Hard mode"" Hard and expert mode will give you a run for your money. There is also a progression mode to earn stars and unlock characters and mods. They get very difficult if not impossible towards the end so proceed with caution. This game is a total retro throwback to many of old segas games so many of the themes in the game have been remixed or improved upon with the exception of old stages from the previous Sonic Racing. My favorite themes in the game are the theme for Burning Depths and the theme for the Golden Axe level. Overall this game is not too bad. Great visuals, nice background music, fun characters. It's a must have for any sonic fan and a 'try' for anyone who remotely likes cart racers. I'm sure you'll get at least some fun out of it. At launch the game released with a online multiplayer mode that was extremely broken and near impossible to play with constant disconnects, empty lobbies and lag to no end. I recently played it again. Match making has been improved but the load times are ridiculous, taking anywhere from 2-3 minutes to load a stage with 10 players. Online Multiplayer is still very laggy causing characters to jump back and forth in time because players aren't synced. Sumo and Sega failed on the one thing that could have made this a game awesome. End the end I'm still disappointed.   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A true kart racer that holds it's own against the likes of Mario Kart Double Dash and Crash Team Racing, ASRT takes the genre in a whole new vivid direction while providing one of the greatest bundles of nostalgia to grace the world, vastly improving over the original ASR in every possible way. Stunning reimagined environments, more creative weapon combos, swift transformations with extensive playtime for each mode, a lively soundtrack that brings out the magic of the original music, and a true all-star cast that are further bolstered by the PC version's benefits make for one of the most definitive racing games on the market and an open love letter recommendation to any SEGA fan.Of further note is that ASRT PC runs more stable and overall better than the original ASR PC, on a chuggy system that just about manages with Team Fortress 2 and Sonic Generations. Truly a lovingly optimized PC port.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Definitely one of the most amusing and amazing racing games I have seen in some time.Playing as one of many SEGA characters (or guests such as the TF2 Crew and Ralph), you take to a highly detailed and very fluid racetrack and race your opponents to the finish. The tracks transform and give way to water or open skies, and your vehicle will transform between car/boat/plane to adjust to the changes.I would say the positive points of this game come from the smoothness of the racing experience, and the rewarding feeling that comes from mastering a race course or passing a particular challenge. The campaign mode tests your abilities in race types varying from normal Races to Drift Challenges, Traffic Attacks to Tank Pursuits. Each racer may earn experience/levels, which lets you modify a racer to specialize in Speed, Acceleration, Handling, Boost, or a well-Balanced version of the stats they would normally use.The only drawbacks: the difficulty curve rises sharply for each new difficulty level, and the AI-controlled racers don't mess around at all, especially on Hard/Expert difficulty; it may be a rough ride regardless of player experience, but it will still feel rewarding and thrilling to pass the toughest tests.Overall rating... 10/10, would race again.

Thus, it's sort of like picking between apples and oranges and in this case, it just becomes a Sega does what NintenDONT. (Just had to say it.)In conclusion, this is one of the best Sega games I've played in recent years. Go figure it was made by Sumo Digital, a second party studio outside of SEGA. In theory, maybe Sega should hire them more often. Anyway, despite the brilliance of this kart racer it does have a few flaws. It certainly lacks that Nintendo polish you see in the Mario Kart series. There are a couple of nasty bugs (mostly in online mode) that do appear out of no where. A patch could really do this game well. Other than that, I'd say it's almost comparable to Mario Kart, maybe some aspects even better than Mario Kart. This game is a perfect solution for those who don't own a Nintendo Platform, but are desperately craving a kart racer, and a good one at that! If you own a Wii U, this is the game you bought while you waited for Mario Kart 8. Some have even argued that Nintendo should have borrowed some elements from Transformed. Transformed is better than nothing, but it's even better if you are a fan of Sega and familar with their back catalog of games.  In short, it's Diddy Kong Racing on steroids, but with Sonic and Sega characters instead. It even has a couple of monkeys from the Super Monkey ball games...that's close enough to Diddy. Don't be fooled by Sega's mediocrity of the past. This game belongs in the top 5 kart racers list. Right up there Crash Team Racing, Diddy Kong Racing, and Mario Kart.OVERALL:+ Good visuals, catchy tunes, fun gameplay-  A few nasty bugs-  Hovercraft can be hard to control. (No different to DKR on N64)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good Kart Racing Game...actually GREAT Kart Racing Game. I myself was raised on Nintendo and only later in life learned about Sonic the Hedgehog and friends. Most of the characters and scenes in this game I am completely oblivious to, but what I am not oblivious to is that I know a good kart racer when I play one. The mechanics in this game remind me of Diddy Kong Racing with the different dimensions the race happens in except you switch midrace. Simply a great game for the kart racing fan in you even if you werent big on the SEGA franchises.Solid Kart Racer 8 out of 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is such a unique racing experience with some pretty awesome characters. It is very fast paced, and doesn't contain just straight races throughout the campaign. The campaign is filled with other types of races and time trial-type races, which make the game more interesting. The tracks are amazing, changing their structure after each lap. The transformation aspect of this game is very unique and pulled off very well. This is a great racing game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I think it's safe to say that this is the best cart game out there and in my opinion the best multiplayer racing game on pc. A variety of players to choose, amazing nintendo-inspired beautiful tracks, three-types of racing in the same game (basically beating the **** out of games based only on that gameplay). You honestly can't ask more from a game of this type. I should also mention that this is a perfect port with no problems like many other games and any gamepad is compatable (no pressure to buy the most expensive gamepad). This will give maany hours of fun and I recommend getting a four-pack whenever you can.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Definitely one of the most amusing and amazing racing games I have seen in some time.Playing as one of many SEGA characters (or guests such as the TF2 Crew and Ralph), you take to a highly detailed and very fluid racetrack and race your opponents to the finish. The tracks transform and give way to water or open skies, and your vehicle will transform between car/boat/plane to adjust to the changes.I would say the positive points of this game come from the smoothness of the racing experience, and the rewarding feeling that comes from mastering a race course or passing a particular challenge. The campaign mode tests your abilities in race types varying from normal Races to Drift Challenges, Traffic Attacks to Tank Pursuits. Each racer may earn experience/levels, which lets you modify a racer to specialize in Speed, Acceleration, Handling, Boost, or a well-Balanced version of the stats they would normally use.The only drawbacks: the difficulty curve rises sharply for each new difficulty level, and the AI-controlled racers don't mess around at all, especially on Hard/Expert difficulty; it may be a rough ride regardless of player experience, but it will still feel rewarding and thrilling to pass the toughest tests.Overall rating... 10/10, would race again.

												Most likely the best kart racer released recently. It definitely beats the recent Mario Karts. The courses are more entertaining and the items are most certainly more balanced than any recent Mario Kart offerings. The multiplayer is solid and the game is slightly more skill based than other similiar Kart games. The fact that the courses utilize kart, boat and plane sections keep the experience fresh.Some of the characters may not be as iconic as Nintendo's stable of racers, but there are more than plenty to choose from.

												So, looking at the screenshots on display, this game looks, being completely honest, like SEGA's attempt at a spin-off crossed with a fanservice.

Oh my jeebus, shoot me down and call me Valve, and announce Half-Life3! It's just too good to be true, but it is very true. Having played most every Sonic game you can think of (going all the way back to Sonic on the Genesis platform) SEGA definitely had its highs and its lows, but this... this is possibly the best Sonic game in the more recent years, not to mention Kart Racing, AND IT'S A PLATFORMER! Who knew a Platformer could be this good?But to the actual game instead of the history then...The mechanics are so fluent, there is very little to want (it would be cool if you would like enter slow-motion and then speed up once the transformation is done though :P) and they all offer a whole new game (literally). If you're strictly good at cars, well, you won't get very far with higher AIs. Aeroplanes and cars couldn't more different, instead of having two controls, (left and right) you now have this whole new demension of up and down and everything imbetween, which means that drifting just got over 9000x more difficult. Don't even get me started on boats (literally, they're so difficult to use!) Driving the boats in this game... what can I say, makes drifting in the air seem like cake. The controls can't even be explained, you just have to buy to find out what I mean.The changing level dynamics of this game are some of the most reinvigorating aspects of any game I've played to date, and there's a good phew of them to play, as well! First lap, you may start with cars, but you may end up entirely on an aquatic level flopping all over the place. So for the first time you play any map, even after that to some extent, it's a new map every time, so if you went left at that one bend, I doubt you'll be able to do that again (on some maps, there are exceptions). And some maps are completely elitist skilled-based. Like, your first 20 times, you won't be able to come in qualifying positions. All in all, this is the kind of game that with it's cartoonyness (if that's a word... well NOW IT IS!) and it's zealous mechanics, really does restore hope in a gaming community that is majoritively starting to become dark and gloomy.

Oh come on, please, to put it bluntly, if you don't get this game, you're missing out on the Amnesia of Scary games, the Skyrim of Free-roam, the Kingdom Hearts of Stories, the Disney of Tales, the Dragon Ball Z of action, the Legend of Zelda of Experiences, the Mario of 8-bit, the Minecraft of creativity, the GMOD of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥around...

The looks of the game are very enjoyable, the sound absolutely immerses us into the game and those weapons you catch remind me of the good old game ReVolt, where you can take down your opponents.The tracks are well balanced, some more difficult than others, of course. The online component is very nice too, you have several modes to play, not just the typical race and it's done. Here you can make a kind of an online career.Adding the full compatibility with Big Picture, yea, this is a good bet if you want to spend good time with some friends!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is definitely the greatest kart racer ever on PC, as the track designs are amazing where some tracks actually transform in terms of gameplay and visual while the vehicles in the game are a joy to drive with incredible depth in its handling. Gameplay wise, it is an incredibly fun racing game.However, if you are a completionist or just someone who is looking for a genuinely difficult racing game, this is for you too, as this game can be really difficult to beat at high difficulty which also offer a lot of replayibility. The AI in this game does not cheat as obvious as other racing games, wthout using cheap tactics like rubber band AI, that brings to the fact that this game encourage skilled gameplay that does not present in other racing games.

												Very fun kart racing game. The single player is pretty fun, but playing muliplayer with your friends is awesome. There are 30 different characters in game, in with a different standard style of driving. Each racer has 6 skills - Speed, Acceleration, Handling, Boost, and All-Star. As you level up your racers you unlock mods which change how those skills are spread out. The different tracks and gamemodes can call for a different setup, so you can usually use your favorite racer with a different mod. (And of course Football Manager is the best racer :D )The tracks are based on old Sega game, and most of them change throughout the 3 laps. There are also sections where you transform into a boat or a plane. There are a few different game modes - SP has a World Tour, a Grand Prix, and single race modes. For MP there are:Standard Race - Race for the top position while utilizing power ups.Battle Arena - Fight to survive using power ups. All players start with three hits. Once all off their hit points are gone, they are out. The last surviving player wins.Battle Race - Fight to survive using power ups. All players start with three hits. Once all off their hit points are gone, they are out. The last surviving player wins.Capture The Chao - A Chao balloon and a capture point spawn in random spots. Bringing the Chao balloon to the capture point adds to the players score. Reaching the target limit or capturing the most before time runs out declares the winner.Boost Race - Race for the top position. There are no items to make use of, only boost pads will help racers in this mode.The boost race isn't that much fun, as using powerups to slow or stun your opponents is the best part of playing a kart game.  The other modes are all very fun though. This is definitely worth picking up during a Steam sale, and if you like kart or racing games $20 isn't bad either.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

TL;DR This game is f*cking awesome, double the fun if you got a controller and HOLY SH*T IT'S SO MUCH FUN WITH FRIENDS!Since I got a controller I was looking for that special game to play that would justify buying one, this is that game.I was trying to convince a group of friends to purchase the game with me so I would have someone to play it with for a while, I must point out that they all play almost exclusively FPS games and were repelled by the idea of playing an arcade or sonic game, yesterday they finally bought it and I swear after the first race they were all so excited and shouting over skype about how much fun they were having and we just played it all night long even though we had a workday coming we played like 20 rounds following each by saying ""I swear this is the last round before bed"".Pros:You can play this game with up to 10 friends!The controls are amazingly smooth and you got a variety of characters to choose from.Tons of ageless fun!Cons:Nopewould/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I would love to see some better server systems though, as lag-outs and DxCs happen all far too often.If you want anything more, like a number rating; ⓴/⓴Anything more? Oh come on, please, to put it bluntly, if you don't get this game, you're missing out on the Amnesia of Scary games, the Skyrim of Free-roam, the Kingdom Hearts of Stories, the Disney of Tales, the Dragon Ball Z of action, the Legend of Zelda of Experiences, the Mario of 8-bit, the Minecraft of creativity, the GMOD of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥around... You're missing out on Sonic of Racing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's the closest thing to playing Mario Kart on a PC and it has enough bells and whistles to make it an excellent game in its own right. SEGA has a rich history and they have transformed that into a heap of excellent stages. Level design is inspired, with many a stage transforming throughout the race - the final lap is often very different to the first lap. Performance on my PC was excellent. I played in at 4k @ 60 fps using a GTX980. Never experienced any slowdown. An easy recommend for anyone who enjoys cart racing games. I'd be shocked if anyone who loved Mario Kart didn't also have a heap of fun playing this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												3D racing games have generally been divided into two broad categories. First you have simulation racers, games that aim for “realism” with physics and car handling that could ostensibly make sense in our own world. Some appeal to the respected F1 aficionado, some exist as a cost-effective way for guys to pretend they have artificial access to the all the hot name-brand cars of feverish adolescent dreams. Which brings us to the other category of racing games: the arcade racer, or simply the ones that are fun: Mario Kart, F-Zero, Outrun, Burnout, and the Need For Speed series in its prime. Zip and zoom through colorful, futuristic fantasy courses, abuse fat plumbers and perpetually-90's cartoon animals with goofy weaponry, safely crash and power drift until the finish line. The brand of car you use to do so doesn’t matter. In fact, it doesn’t have to be a car at all as long as the action is beautiful.  Developed by Sumo Digital, Sonic & All-Stars Racing: Transformed is an arcade racer that captures the spirit of the genre, its twists and turns throughout the decades, while simultaneously paying homage to Sega's better days. It borrows concepts from its forebearers and manages to improve upon them or make the formula fresh again, against the odds. The A to B routine is thus: hold down accelerate, drift around corners, repeat for a set number of laps quicker than your opponent. SASRT aims to keep your hands and senses focused at every second, no cruise control. As the name of the game should imply, the courses and cars transform: land to air, air to sea, cars become boats and planes. Nintendo 64 classic Diddy Kong Racing attempted a land/air/sea dynamic, but races only allowed one vehicle and terrain at a time. SASRT will throw you from asphalt to water or sky at a brisk pace in any given race. The tracks themselves will often transform on the 2nd and 3rd laps, ensuring that you'll stay aware instead of falling into rigid muscle memory, lap after lap. Item pickups are lifted from the kart racing subgenre that Mario Kart pioneered, but their inclusion balances out the action rather than punishing skilled players. There are no items like the oft-dreaded blue shell from Mario Kart, no items that feel excessively unfair whenever they smack you from front or behind. With enough skill, damage can even be avoided altogether through perfectly executed evasive boosting. What sets this game apart from a mere whimsical kart racer is the sense of speed. Especially on the higher difficulty levels, SASRT approaches F-Zero GX levels of breakneck precision. The vehicles don’t control like silky smooth, marshmallowy sweet go-karts, but rather strange beasts that feel like they need to be wrangled in order to reach the finish line in a decent placing.  Boosting is key to winning against the sometimes brutal AI, a task that can be accomplished in a number of ways. Smart drifting is the most important tool, with each successful maneuver giving a varying amount of boost power. Sumo Digital was also responsible for the console and PC ports of Sega AM2's OutRun 2006 Coast 2 Coast, an arcade game renowned for its drift mechanics. After playing SASRT, it's apparent that Sumo has a keen understanding of that game's framework, the precarious task of coding lovely, frictive momentum into a racing game. They've even managed to keep the fast friction intact during the air race segments, a task I haven't seen accomplished by other games of this ilk (I’m looking at you, Banjo Pilot). Also borrowed from the all-important Mario Kart is the trick system. While later entries in that series allow for simple one-button tricks to be performed off of ramps for a small speed boost, SASRT designates four directional inputs on your second analog stick for accomplishing combos. You can perform backflips, forward flips, side somersaults however many times you think is smart before nailing (or screwing up) the landing. Though it’s not as complex as any trick-focused game like SSX, it’s another element to keep in mind while racing. Arcade racers thrive on a pick-up-and-play mentality and don’t need to have complex fighting game-like button combinations, but SASRT tries to keep more advanced players on their toes. You can even do tricks off the waves and crests in the water, encouraging you to always keep your eyes on the road (whatever form it takes) for ways to get ahead of the competition.Unfortunately, unlike the gameplay itself, not as much holistic attention was paid to the game’s presentation. The game comes close to being a celebration of Sega, a fanboy’s greatest hits stocking stuffer. Yes, there's an unlockable racer that transforms into Dreamcast controller, a vehicle that belches the console’s signature disc-reading grinding noises and home menu bloops. Yes, the first track in the game features a remix medley featuring “You Can Do Anything” from Sonic CD. The song that plays when Beat from Jet Set Radio gets his All-Star power-up is an awesome jam, too. All of these flourishes are nearly negated by the inclusion of NASCAR superstar Danica Patrick. And that box-office neanderthal Wreck-It-Ralph.  And the obligatory PC-only Team Fortress 2 character and some historical-esque characters from the Total War and Company of Heroes series. Once again, I have to compare Sega to its closest analogue as a publisher and a creative brand, its once friendly rival that has survived all these years as Shenmue 3 dies endlessly and Sonic’s arms are dyed blue. Nintendo’s biggest games often have a fetish-like focus on their own history,with constant throwbacks and an internal logic at play within their respective game worlds. The Mario Kart games feel like they exist in a unified world despite all the wildly different locales. Look up a picture of the Lakitu creatures: it makes logical sense that they’re the unionized workers controlling the cameras, starting green lights, fishing out racers from bottomless ditches and lakes. To be fair, SASRT does have the disadvantage (or advantage, depending) of drawing characters from various series under the Sega brand. Nintendo’s Smash Bros series does a similar feat, though the inclusion of non-Nintendo characters and worlds from Mega Man and Sonic makes some kind of sense: there’s a similar demographic of fans and a rich intertwined history behind those iconic characters. Including Danica Patrick in a game like this is as awkward, weird and incongruous as the time Sonic The Hedgehog was forced to kiss a CGI human woman back in 2006.It’s a good thing it doesn’t matter who or what you race as in an arcade racer. If Disney putting Wreck-It-Ralph in this game helped support all the people who crafted this excellent feeling Sega game, then let Mickey Mouse’s warm corporate fingers embrace all of Sega. Life support is an expensive and dear thing, keep that in mind.Sonic & All-Stars Racing: Transformed is more than a Mario Kart clone or a “Mario Kart Killer,” more than a praiseworthy attempt by Sega to “do what Nintendon’t”. For all its blemishes, this is the best game released by Sega in years. Yes, there are many other excellent titles that have proudly worn that old blue and white logo during this past generation. But when I say Sega, I’m talking about the real Sega, a brand that had so many forward-thinking yet simple ideas that exploded into the arcades and our living rooms alike, ones far too unique to make good business sense. A Sega that was more than a corporate publishing vessel for PC strategy games and deceptive blue-hedgehog-hamster-wheels on your mobile phone. A Sega that entranced fans and made its name seem like a colorfully exotic word, a gift from the beyond, rather than the boring truth: a portmanteau of “Service Games.” Just one more quarter in the slot, one more clearance Dreamcast sold for $99, and maybe we could all have a good time for just another year.

												Well, I can recommend this game to all of you, who likes old game crash team racing, but not just for them.I was a little sceptic, becouse I never played game like this since I'm not a child, yeah I know, I was dumb :DDo here we go.+ Amazing graphic, nice effects, great models.+ Funny comments of your creatures and good dubbing. + Multiplayer, indeed if you play with your friends - but beware if you will be better than them everytime, they will be angry to you and maybe on this game also :D+ Great maps and mods- Handling can be little difficulty if you don't have a controller, especially in fly mode. But I have to say that, I don't have any controller and if you are not an idiot, you can handle it.That's all. Oh, I almost forget, you should try to off voice volume, it was really funny.

												(This review was written BEFORE the release of Mario Kart 8, which is now my favourite racing game ever. So yeah.)I can safely call this my favourite racing game of all time, and not just because it has Sonic in it. This game features gorgeous visuals, music and characters, and fantastic track design and original concepts and stage gimmicks to keep things fresh. If it was worth me buying a second copy, as I already own a near-fully completed copy on my PS3, then that certainly states that I recommend this game to not only Sonic and SEGA fans, but fans of racing games and videogames in general. If you want more graphical charm and don't have an amazing PC (like me) you may be better off getting a console version, but seriously, buy this amazing gem of a racer right now! It is worth MORE than the pricetag of $20, and certainly more than the $5 that it is on sale for!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sonic All-Stars RACING TRANSFORMED® is a game you would rightfully assume is about going fast, then going faster. In reality it's a harsh lesson about how the world works and what to expect in the competitive job market. In your quest to go fast and feel the sunshine you will quickly find out others too want to go fast, in fact they want to go faster than you. The problem is if someone is going fast more than you are going fast then you are in fact not going fast so only one person can actually go fast. This creates a situation where much like the race for jobs and the corporate ladder, when you have everyone trying to go fast no one in fact goes fast since you constantly impede each other from going fast.Which is symbolism for the nuclear arms race.I give this game 10 WHY ARE THERE BEES OH GOD THERE'S MORE BEES WHO EVEN MAKES ALL THESE BEES OH GOD THEY'RE ALL OVER MY CAR AND IN MY PANTS AND OH GOD MY EYE WHY GOD WHY Out Of 10.

												You know how Nintendo keeps making Mario Karts, and how they always add something new to the mix, but it never quite overhauls the base principles? Well, Sonic Racing Transformed does. I bet SEGA took every single complaint ever made about Mario Kart, and worked it into an extremely well made and competative kart racer. The AI isn't made of super rubber, there are no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t blue shells, the catch-up item is fair, the selection of characters is diverse and entertaining, the transforming mechanic really shakes up the pace and the tracks are a real step up from the last installment. It also feels more like a SEGA all stars homage then just Sonic & co. with some other peeps. You're really in the SEGA universe thanks to the wide representation of series, the music and the online works. That last isn' really SEGA, but contrary to Mario Kart's online, its a step upwards. I'm fueling a 90s console war debate here and I'm loving it. Great game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The most fun arcade racer I've played so far. Basically Mario Kart with Sega characters.

												Mario Kart doesn't hold a candle to this. SEGA and Sumo Digital have giving us kart racing perfected.The game at higher difficulties does get challenging, like really challenging, like old school challenging. Be ready for that if you want to make it to endgame.In multiplayer it's a blast, well worth it if you have a large screen for Big Picture.There's plenty of racing modes and unlocks, stuff for the casual and stuff for the hardcore. Overall, it's great and you owe it to yourself to play this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is like a Mario Kart for PC. Is that bad? Heck no. In some aspects this is even better than Mario Kart. For example, the circuits change each lap, so you are not driving the same circuit in one race, and that is great.The characters are a bit derp for me. I mean, You have Sonic, Alex Kid, and then you have a Shogun and a Roman soldier.... what? But I don't think that it's something bad, I find them really funny.The game is playable with keyboard with keybinding are pretty bad, but you can change then. The port is great in my opinion, I have no perfonmance problems.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Got this game for my kids and I'm having as much fun as they are.  This is Mario Kart on some serious steroids.   Pure arcade racing in some pretty imaginative environments.  The PC port has the usual interface hiccups - but the in game action is perfect.  Everything looks crisp and the action is fast.  I do play this title with a controller - as with most racing games this benefit from analog triggers.I had this game for the Wii U - and decided not to keep that console.  Once I saw the PC port, I knew I had to get it.  It was worth the $30 they originally charged for the game.  It was a complete steal at $5. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was unexpected. I tried a demo from the previous version on the PS3 and it was great to play with friends but this..this is just AWESOME!As a long time Mario Kart player this ain't a pure clone, it's a superior experience. You have land kart transforming into air and water machines on every track, you have super funny ""Capture The Chao"" games or Battle Arena ones, there's even a Boost Race mode.The characters are well designed and there's a lot of interesting cameos(Wreck-it Ralph and Team Fortress among others), the tracks are amazing and the graphic and light effects are just awesome.I was expecting a bad console porting too but the game just feels fluid and great.Sure, it's better played with a gamepad but once you learn the basic controls even playing with the default keyboard layout feels right and you never have the feeling you're not in control of your kart.Definitely a big big surprise I'd reccomend to everyone, playing with 2 other friends already makes it 100 times more awesome!The single player is good too and it's necessary to unlock tracks(which you unlock anyway if you play with a friend who owns it) and characters but I'd still reccomend to get it if you have friends to play with.VOTE: 8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is possibly the best Mario Kart style racing game yet. It's absolutely gorgeous, has excellent track design, the transforming vehicle gimmick works very well, lots of variety in tracks and racers, unlockable customization options for each racer, and it's just a hell of a lot of fun.Unlike the first All-Stars racing game, this one does have the full set of online modes an options on the PC version. In face, it's an incredibly solid PC port. I wonder if the three racers added from PC gaming franchises are there to reassure us that Sega isn't short-changing the PC versions of their games anymore.If you've ever enjoyed any kart-style racing game, I can recommend this one without hesitation.

												As a big fan of the SMK (Mario Kart) series and hearing a lot about this game, I finally decided to give it a go and dropped some money on it.  I chose the PC version over the Wii U version (my second choice - and may still pick it up for Wii U) because of the larger character roster and DLC.  Note that I haven't picked up any DLC - yet.Difficulty notwithstanding (I feel the game is pretty easy, even on hard), the game is a lot of fun!  Unlike Mario Kart, there are very few OP weapons, and there are no weapons that will hunt you mercilessly if you're in 1st.  As a matter of fact, it's possible to evade almost all weapons thrown or shot at you, given enough skill, which is a plus for me.  The stages are well-designed, the big point-earner being that all the stages change from lap to lap, sometimes significantly.  The stage changes result in your character changing the vehicle they're racing in on-the-fly, which brings us to a more contentious part of the game: flying and motorboating.  Although I find that a higher Handling for your character results in a more controlled flight (I personally love flying in this game, though many weapons become harder to use - there is a bit of auto-aiming provided, though), I don't get the same kind of responsive control when on the water.  Unfortunately, I feel the water physics is pretty mediocre at best, and this especially rings true on certain stages where you're on the water for most of the race.  Sega definitely invested more in flying mechanics and racing on the ground.Finally, the character selection is very diverse, with famous Sega mascots all appearing, some old-school characters that haven't seen the light of day in a long time (looking at you, Alex Kidd!), and for the PC version, PC-specific characters, such as the Spy/Pyro/Heavy trio from Team Fortress 2.  The only character that I felt was kinda just forced in was Wreck-It Ralph, who isn't a Sega character and doesn't have any games on the PC.Overall, I'm really enjoying this game, though I feel it is a bit on the easy side.  Is it worth the 20 bucks?  I'd say so, though if you find it on sale, scoop it up immediately!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Back in the days, I used to play Mario Kart quite a lot. Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed brings back memories of the ""good old days"". :3I really love the mix of competitive racing and kind of arena-style fighting. No other ""normal"" racing game was ever this much fun - pure racing is just not enough for me.If you used to like Mario Kart, you most likely will love this game! :) Well, I certainly do. <3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Product received for free
												To be honest, I was gifted this game by a friend so I didn't spend any money on it, however... It is worth the price that it is now.The game, although filled to the brim with unrecognizable characters besides Sonic and his Friends, TF2, and Wreck-It Ralph (For me), is still fun whether or not you know who the characters are. Each character has different stats and different animations and it's always fun to try out new characters. You can also go through blue rings in order to transform and your vehicle can either transform from a car to a boat to a plane whenever you pass through them, hence why this is ""Transformed"". It's fun and kind of reminds me of Mario Kart except each stage feels unique and different, including several stages from different Sega games such as Sonic The Hedgehog, Golden-Axe, etc.DLC is pretty cool too, the best one would have to be the Metal Sonic DLC for me because Metal Sonic has to be one of my favorite villains in Sonic The Hedgehog. It includes Metal Sonic of course and a stage called Outrun which is pretty nice. Did I mention it's the cheapest DLC of the 3? ;)Yogscast would probably have to be my least favorite one, I know it's for charity, but if they really wanted to use an internet celebrity, I think they should have done the Angry Video Game Nerd, would have really liked to see some F-Bombs drop on Sonic while he's racing against him.All in all 9/10 as a racing game for me, this is probably one of the best celebrity racing games I've ever played, although the celebrities are not very recognizable if you haven't played their respected games, you can still appreciate the gameplay and who knows, it could even get you interested in their games and you could find a new one to play :P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As far as I can tell, this is your best option for a kart racer on the PC without resorting to emulation. I've found that kart racers are either really fun, or terribly bad, and given Sonic's track record over the past few years, it feels like this would have been an awful game... surprisingly enough, this is a great fun time and I definitely think it is worth checking out. It also gets a special mention for having 4-player local co-op, which is unfortunately rare. Great level design, fun racing mechanics, and it has enough content to last you awhile.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is fun as hell, has astonishing graphics, cool music and great environments. Play it with friends or single-player, it's a unique experience. BEWARE: it's ADDICTIVE AS HELL. You may ask: How come? Well let me tell you this: yesterday was GTA V's release and I got it for PS3. It's installed and I played 1-2 hours (don't get me wrong, I love the new GTA V and I think it's pure awesomeness... but ... but this little...) and in Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed I already have 9.2 hours of gameplay (single-player & multi-player). THIS LITTLE GAME HAS THE POWER TO PUT GTA V ON HOLD - for that and not only for that I'll give it a 10/10 for the best arcade-racing game of 2013. GORGEOUS!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
