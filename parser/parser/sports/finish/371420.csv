tl;drA worth-while entry in the Kart Racer genre that is entirely over-looked because it's a Floppy Ear title! Fun for all ages and a Buy for Kart Racing enthusiasts.full review.Teddy Floppy Ear - The Race is a cute, little Kart Racer that has more going on than you can shake a stick at.  It has several racing modes, several kart performance upgrades, plenty of unlockables from cars to characters, several difficulty levels to accomodate racers of all skill-levels and some beautiful and cartoony courses with enough variety to keep it interesting.  Best of all, it has a surprisingly solid sense of speed, which is core to any good racing game.  It's unfortunate that this game doesn't get a fair chance inspite of it's lineage; from the perspective of a single-player Kart Racer, it's pretty darn good.  There are, however, some minor problems:First: the wonky controls. They are soft and slippery.  They can almost feel broken when you first start playing.  But... once you adapt to the steering mechanics and adjust your driving style, you will find yourself speeding around corners and passing your competitors with ease and glee. The learning curve for me was about 45-minutes of race-time. Second: The weird music.And as far as the music goes, it's weird and a total mismatch for what is happening on-screen. Turn it off in the Settings and play your own up-tempo music of choice.  I played EDM and Trance for this game and it kicked up the atmosphere to eleven.Once you disable the weirdly mismatched music and spend some time learning how to control your racer... it becomes really fun!It's definitely no Sonic Racer, but, it's certainly better and more fun than, the albeit more polished, F1 Race All-stars.  Of all the Kart Racers on Steam, it's a worth-while one. At full price (4,99 at the time of this review), I would recommend this for Kart Racing enthusiasts. However, if you enjoy Kart Racing and are the type of gamer who is willing to put a bit of time into learning how to steer your kart, then this is an easy Buy, especially if you get it on sale. pros.+ Cute pseudo-paper-cutout graphics style+ Well-designed tracks, including shortcuts+ Beautifully cartoony tracks+ Fun and responsive power-ups and attacks+ Day and night tracks+ Good AI competitors+ Solid sense of speed+ Split-screen, local multiplayer (I didn't test this)+ Many unlockables (tracks, cars, characters, etc)+ Kart performance upgrades (tires, exhaust, paint jobs, etc)+ Full 1080P Support+ Full Controller Supportcons.- Music is just terrible  (turn it off and play your own)- Kart controls are sloppy, but fun once you adapt- No online multiplayer support- Limited graphics settingsThis game is appropriate for all ages and skill-levels.Please hit the like button if you found this review at all helpful.

												I love Teddy Floppy Ear, but I think this game might be too difficult for the age range the other games are targeted at. It's hard not to wreck. This game is good for older kids, but not very young. I enjoy the game otherwise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game looks cute and simple enough but wait until you give it a few test runs.. Yes the game is fun but issue is at least for me the controls. You def need to keep your finger on the gas and slowly release it on the turns or you keep your finger on the gas and break on turns smoothly in order to make decent turns. So I believe this game requires more skill then expected. Keep in mind you must make a lot of SHARP turns to avoid other npc hurtful pickups and track obsticles.So if you are looking for an easy 100% or a casual game I don't think this is a fit but believe it or not this is a bit more ""competative"" then what it looks like lol at least for my noobie skills. I still will play it but I do not see myself playing it a lot since it only has local co-op. So if you are looking for something like this then this is the game for you but don't be fooled by how kiddie it looks!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game for my young sons, expecting something similar to Sonic Racing or Mario Kart.   It's nothing like that.Multiplayer is somewhat supported, meaning it will supposedly offer two-player split screen racing.  However, when we tried it, none of the controls would work.  Plus, apparently only one controller is supported, so the second player would need to use the keyboard.  At least, I think so, because we could not actually get it working. We did get it to work on single player.  However, the sound effects are offensively bad, the controls are terrible, and the car would often just flip over for no reason.   Not fun, not entertaining, and certainly not worth the several dollars we paid for the game. There was only one review when I bought the game, and it was positive.   Now there's a realistic review, so you've been warned.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game, is certainly not what you expect. It starts off as a goofy non-serious kart racer until you actually start getting into the racing. The racing itself feels more like it is trying to be a simulator. You need to know racing lines, and the slow in fast out techniques that apply in Gran Turismo, Forza, and Project Cars. Combine that with some seriously goofy weapons. That said, i am rather surprised at how fluent the controls are on the gamepad. I went into this cracking up thinking ""what on Earth am i buying for a dollar."" to going ""wow, this is rather fun!'. Needless to stay i am still dieing whenever i see the name of this. The music on the other hand.. i am indifferent to it, it isn't bad, yet it isn't great. I'd recommend playing your own stuff after a while. I would not recommend this for young kids who may not be experienced with simulators, this game is deceptive and they will get frusturated quickly. I certainly was not expecting the sim aspect. Think Gran Turismo with the option to cheat with goofy weapons and oil slicks. I have only played about 15 minutes, but i must say i am pleasantly surprised by the gameplay itself. Kudos to the devs on a job well done.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Delightful racing game similar to Mario Kart series. Likable characters, easy interface, nice variety of race types, etc.The game suffers from a major flaw. It is WAY too hard for its intended audience which is children. The NPC characters are too unforgiving of mistakes and children will be frustrated. At higher difficulties and tracks, some of the races are very difficult. I am a seasoned Mario Kart player and even I have difficulty winning some races or time trials. I’m guessing it would be near impossible for younger kids, especially if they have not been brought up on keyboard only controls (see below).99% of the races are determined by fractions of second (which makes it even odder why the developers chose to use whole second rather than hundredths), often with racers crossing the finish line at the same time.I found the controls simple unlike many other reviewers. You basically only use A W D and the space bar with an occasional S key thrown in when you screw up and have to back up…not sure what all the fuss is. I think many Steam users are console immigrants or are not old school keyboarders (read: spoiled). The controls are fine the way they are.While the game has cute elements and is very enjoyable, overall I cannot recommend the game as it will not appeal to its target audience. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

			here is the review for this game on steam http://steamcommunity.com/id/blinkdoggie/recommended/371420		

Its more playable than the Hello Kitties racer but still no Mario kart, The main issue is it feels a little flat.This is from some children series.Your car won't take turns to well and the physics seem off sometimes but the AI isn't all that swift and it seems players get better boosts off speed ramps.The power-up are odd things like lemon aid (oil slick+speed boost), marmalade (tar patch+speed boost), nails (road hazard), boots (speed boost), air spray (pushes everyone away from you), ?pretzels rolls or pigs in a blanket? (push back+speed boost), and milk (makes you big ?to help avoid hazards? it makes you flip easier though)You can unlock upto 16 characters, 10 tracks (night and day so 5x2), 10 car, and extras for the cars.In all there are 5 race modes and they are.Single racePlay 3 laps on any of the boards you have unlocked with ai racers.Time attackTry be beat a track within a time limit without power-ups (track speed boosters are still there).This is 1 lap and with no other racers.Collectors slalomHere you have 3 laps & a time limit to collect 80% of the stares on the track.You have a bar showing you how good your doing and once the yellow part if full you're done.Racing season Play 4 matches of 1 vs 1 racing the AI.This is set up like a 1on1 fighting bracket, where the winner moves on to the next until you have 1 winner.Floppy cupThis plays like a normal racing game, where after each race you get points depending on your placement.After a few races the player with the most points wins.There is also a local Co-opthis in split screen only.
