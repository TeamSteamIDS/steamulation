												It's right now the best Tennis game on Steam. It feels like a Mario Tennis but with some other cute players. I would recommend it to tennis fans, it's really fun with friends.			",237,20,17,20,13,2,18

												This game is not meant to be serious like the Virtua Tennis series. This is a nice arcade style tennis game with lots of character customization and fun mini games. I haven\'t tried the multiplayer yet but soon I will. The game wasn\'t easy for me at first but it got interesting once I got the Hang of it. There is nothing much to say about graphics and there are no extra options for graphics other than changing the resolution. Overall I\'d recommend only if you are a fan of tennis games.

												I got this because one of the reviews says it plays like Mario Tennis. It absolutely does not.I've played just about every popular tennis game. Mario Tennis, Top Spin, Virtua Tennis, Wii Sports are all good in their own way thanks to solid mechanics. Smoots World Cup Tennis's mechanics are awful: unresponsive controls, low shot variety, inconsistent ball speed and bounce, no spin, useless lobs, etc. Rallies end up looking very dumb.Also, there's no mouse support, and the menus are needlessly difficult to navigate through with keyboard or controller. This is a PC exclusive by the way.What else... oh yeah, the characters all make the same high-pitched moan every time they hit the ball. Very annoying.			",51,8,1,5,0,0,0

												I'm not a tennis fan myself, but I find this game very entertaining and fun to play!The graphics are cool, the playability is very good, and in general everything is very intuitive.The best: The minigames. They are perfect if you want to play tennis in a different way (zombies??, star wars?!?!, that's just great). They are very refreshing.The worst: I have to find something yet.			",3,39,0,0,0,1,0
