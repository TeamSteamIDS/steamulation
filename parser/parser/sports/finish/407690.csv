												What a pile of junk.  strike 3.  Not ability to edit controls, clunky interface, crappy music, no play by play, limited game modes.  Waste of $20.  Last time I'll be scammed by this series.  3.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bottom of the 4th, Pujols at the plate. Here comes the 2-1 pitch... and he hits a screamer into the alley in left center!!!! This will go for extra bases! Wait... Albert? Albert?? He's just standing at home plate! ALLLLBERRRTTT!!!!!! And Pujols is thrown out at first.""Yes, this game has bugs. But wait - I'm an uncoordinated old fart - maybe I hit the wrong button on my steam controller. Nope. The little mini-map that shows the base runners showed no base runners. It wasn't my noobness. Considering other bugs, I know it wasn't me.After the very first game, my starting pitcher won the game! Woot. Then he won it again! Wait huh? After the one and only game, my first starting pitcher had a record of 2-0. That's Cy young material there!This is one of those games you wish you had a ""Meh"" button mashed between the ""Yes I recommend it"" and ""No I dont"" buttons. It's a fun little arcady type game. If you are looking for a serious and detailed baseball simulation, look elsewhere. If you want to blow 10 minutes every now and then in a brain dead way, then yeah.... I recommend it despite its faults. The graphics aren't quite Major League quality (more like double A) but its merely adequate. The sound? Well... my recomendation is to play this while watching a real baseball game and crank up the TV's volume.In the end, Im giving it a thumbs up because I will probably keep playing it for whatever brain dead reason of mine.

												This Game isn't what I was looking for but its a step up from last year. I was a bit let down by the fact that the game developers didn't make a carrer mode or a Francise mode this year. And the fact that they don't allow trades during the season and there's no custom create a player mode or sliders. I just didn' like it!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a fan (and owner) of the original RBI Baseball from the Nintendo days, I am very pleased with this game. Has all the nostalgic nods to the old days and brings it to today. It feels and plays just like I remember it. Was able to just jump right in and get at it. Of course, there are quite a few improvements over the NES version of yester years with authentic MLB rosters and stats along with pretty good renders of the actual stadiums (that I have seen so far). Takes a bit of time to get use to the speed of the pitching and controlling your fielders, but I know this will be one I will enjoy as the season goes on.Those of you looking for an experience like MLB The Show, keep moving. This is by no means a complete MLB simulation game. Graphics are smooth and purdy, but I care more for gameplay than I do how good it looks.This was my first time playing any of the new RBI Baseball games that started in 2014, and I am happy with my purchase. Cant wait to get more in tune with the controlls and timing so that I may get my taste of online ranked matches.In short, if you loved the original RBI Baseball on the NES, this will not dissapoint. PLAY BALL!!!! GO ASTROS!!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
