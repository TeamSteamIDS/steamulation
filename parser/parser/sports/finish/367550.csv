												If you love Sports Management Sims and Rugby League, this is the game for you. Various updates over the 2013 edition, including a 3D (kind of?) Game Day which is a joy to watch compared to the 2D sprites we're used to. Pick your favourite NRL or SL team and take them to victory. Or even pick a lower tier team just for fun, such as a US team and build them into a force.Upon tinkering with the game a bit more, I highly recommend you read the Starters Guide from the launch menu. It will help you tremendously. I also recommend you take your time to learn the game properly; it's very daunting at first but when you sink a couple of hours into it and fully learn the mechanics, it is very rewarding.The only downside I can see is there are a fair few teams/championships lacking proper logos which were included in the 2013 Edition. Hopefully these can be sorted out in the future, I may have to play around with the Player Editor (also a great feature) and see if I can fix some names and player stats manually. The game is also very pricey which may deter a few people. But I've sunk 50+ hours into the 2013 edition and with modern rosters I can't wait to sink 500+ into this one. This game isn't for anyone, but if you're a Rugby League enthusiast who wants a Sim game akin to Football Manager, this is just for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												pretty ordinary, no way this is worth $40USD. feel pretty ripped off honestly. the developers havent done their homework on the NRL what so ever. apparently Luke Robinson (Huddersfield Giants) is a better half back than Adam Reynolds (South Sydney) John Sutton is listed as the Rabbitohs best goal kicker even though he is only 7/15 lifetime 58%. seems like a massive super league bias when i look through the ratings of players. they dont understand how the NRL Feeder teams work. the NSW cup teams seem to work as their own entity with their own players. none are associated with the parent NRL teams as they have their own reserve squads and junior teams.

												Rugby League is my first sport. I have played semi pro and watch every game i can. This game in places can be a little basic for example during contract talks and transfers. The UI is difficult to handle also but is picked up over time. That said i highly recommend this game to any league fan. It is the only real manager game for this sport and they also has full backing from all the teams, meaning that all the players are on there with full profiles and pictures and all the teams have official names and stadiums. Once you get past the awkward UI the game is huge and quiet detailed. This game allows you to manage all aspects of running your own club from training to finances and all in between. You are able to start with a sunday league team right up to super league and international. As a Wigan fan they were my first team and it was fun interacting with the players i know and love. As a side note season 2015 is warringtons year ;-P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Finally, the day has dawned when there's a rugby league management game of real, genuine quality. It isn't perfect but this is a huge day for the sport as we finally have a management game to be proud of. If you are willing to learn the nuances of what you can do here, this title is as in depth as any you might come across in any other sport. It isn't perfect and will need to evolve over time, but this is the first game in a new franchise and is a fantastic effort. I was fortunate enough to have early access and I am addicted. You can take a tiny club up and down the divisions (my spell in charge of my local team Blackbrook resulted in relegation before immediate redemption the season later) and the level of detail you can work on is huge. Stadia, academies, training facilities, gyms and so on. Each one will chip away at making your team better and making more available to you. The 3D match engine is surprisingly impressive and you can see the calls and tactics you come up with being put into practice, which is a really good feeling when you have success. You can have team calls that work with your preferred style of play. You can concentrate on attack like Leigh or you can concentrate on the gritty, rough defence like a Shaun Wane ""inspired"" WIgan. There is so much detail to go through that you can have different experiences in different leagues. Different tactics prosper in the lower levels when you have less tactical nous at your disposal. The NRL has a higher standard of player and will not hesitate to punish you or your team for making errors or not being fit enough. I can't praise this enough - it isn't as vast as Football Manager and anyone expecting it to be so is being unrealistic. The difference in budget is massively pronounced. But it is absolutely the king of Rugby League management games, and it is a crown that I have been waiting for a title to take for a very long time.  Well,well worth a buy if you love rugby league.

												It is with a heavy heart that I give this a thumbs down.You don't know for how many years I badly wanted a game like this and here it is and it's not what I wanted exactly. It's getting there though and I thank you for the effort!Cons-Interface is unappealing and a chore to navigate.-Hard for a new player to get a handle on what they are doing. -Ratings are way off on some players(Adam Reynolds who is South Sydney's number 1 goal kicker and premiership winning halfback is average, when someone like Alex Johnston is instantly World Class on the back of one good season? 2 players in the Souths squad yet to make their first grade debut have more value than Adam Reynolds? If I start a game I may as well sign a new halfback to replace the one I have who is one of the best in the game in real life!)-Some players are missing entirely. I understand someone like Kirisome Auva'a being suspended for almost the entire 2015 season might have been hard to simulate in-game but you'd have been better off having him unrealistically available from the start than not to have him in at all.Pros-It's a Rugby League Management game.-The development team to time to actually make a freaking Rugby League management game and they came as close as they did to getting it right!-One of my initial concerns has been changed from a con into a pro and that is the Australian League system is set up unrealistically. Why is that now a good thing? From a gaming perspective, I have come to realise that I much prefer taking teams and battling for promotion and against relegation than like what a more realistic simulation of the Australian game would be. What would be the point of ever managing North Sydney in the NSW Cup(or any lower grade Australian team) if the NRL team I am the feeder club for keeps taking my good players and all I have to play for at the end of the day is the NSW Cup? With promotion and relegation added in, I can actually get North Sydney to the NRL and battle against the best teams in Australia for a competition trophy that actually means something! I now hope they never fix this! (or if they do, there's 2 modes of the game where you can play either a realistic simulation or the current setup).I understand that some of my examples of cons are rather specific but I've seen similar concerns that people have with their own favourite teams so I think they are valid points.Some things I'd suggest.-Tidy up the interface and just generally make it more user friendly for player of all skill levels.-Work on the ratings of players. If your development team is small, get some volunteers like FM do. If I had the tech knowhow I'd be more than willing to volunteer for rating for some players.-Have more happen at the start of the game to draw a player in. I remember playing International Cricket Captain and you'd go through budget phases and signing players to contracts and setting up training for the next few weeks and so on.As things are, it's a thumbs down but if you're undecided and reading my review and you can get it really cheap, you love Rugby League and don't mind tinkering with some ratings at the start, it'd be a thumbs up.Edit: I notice someone marked my review as 'unhelpful' How in the hell was my review unfair? I wasn't needlessly critical, I tried to be constructive with my review and gave suggestions as to what I thought could improve and you'll notice that despite giving it a thumbs down I thank the developers for their efforts and even advise undecided people that this game might currently be a thumbs down from me but it might not necessarily be for you!You're a jerk random thumbs down person!Edit:-I notice 3 people now have given a thumbs down to my review.Is it because It says 3.5 hours played? Ever thought that because of crappy internet connections in regional Australia that maybe I play steam games offline? Especially ones that don't have any need to be online like this game.Edit:-It's now up to 5 people marking it unhelpful? *Tears remaining hair out, dresses in black and writes bad poetry in a graveyard*			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a massive RL fan and someone that has been playing management games for 20+ years I have to say this has some ups but many more downs. The ups - Finally a licensed RL manager game is released, that probably is the only upGood player listingsThe downs - Massively overpriced for what you get.5 minutes game time to complete a set of six tackles which in real life take 60 seconds - that is a joke to let that slip thru to the end product. 15 years behind leading sports manager games - football manager seriesLay out is confusing, looks animated and very amateurishWatching game play is like a throw back to old EA sports games more than a decade agoPop up menu at each click makes me want to drop a bowling ball on my footPlayer stats very inaccurate, actual salary cap is nothing like real life, player wages inaccurateThe more I play the more I am disappointed, the RL had a great chance to put their brand on something good.But this is what was produced, I hope someone will go check out the FM series of games and suggest they geta serious management game going in 2016 based on facts and not fantasy from someone sitting in a room somewherethrowing this into a bowl and saying ""here you go everyone, its a fantastic RL Manager package"".......... it is not.I would wait until this game is on special before you buy it, you will get sick of it very quickly and return to more credible manager games like the FM series. Fingers crossed if this RL games continues the developers will bin this and have a serious rethink, older sports management game players dined out on this stuff pre 2000. Do better next time, much better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
