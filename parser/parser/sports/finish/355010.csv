Early Access Review
								Neat little top down retro racer, with a lot of variety and a track editor. The soundtrack gets you in the mood for racing as well with a good number of uptempo tunes. Takes some skill as the AI is fairly unforgiving and quite aggressive. The cars have solid physics also. Watch those drifts, a drunk driving simulator this isn't!!  A better than decent time waster and a really playable product considering it's early access. In fact, looks not too far off from being finished to me, Very polished. Can only get better with time, Especially once multiplayer is in place. For now, im going to score this a well deserved 8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
