												Why would I recommend FMT over FM? It is not missing anything I deem important anymore. It has everything that I desire in FM and it is faster. Gone are the annoying press crap, gone is the need to coddle and babysit players. In fact, it has some features that the full FM does not have, like the ability to train only the players I desire and let the AI do the rest. In full FM it either all or none, seems silly to give such a great feature to FMT and not have it in FM.In all, if I was to compare this the previous version of FMT (FMC) then yes, this is a huge step forward.

												Has 95% of the features from FM that I want, cuts 95% of the features I don't. Excellent! Has that CM 01/02 feel, but with updated tactics (e.g. player roles) and match engine. The media nonsense from the main game is gone, replaced with occasional one-off questions with logic answers.I miss the ability to choose individual staff (each category; scouting, medical, etc only has a single department head) and there is no editor (FMRTE is compatible, but it's not free).Despite the name, it is not compromised by touch/tablet support. You can select a normal skin and choose as many leagues as you want if you're only going to play on a PC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really impressive game all round :-) I play FM Touch only on my laptop, last year was good this year is even better, fast processing and quick loading times, great options and a responsive 'feels real' match engine. Players are easier to buy and amazingly easier to sell, they also give you a reason for not signing, so you know what you need to do to get them, as well as give you the option to negotiate promises. I have never been able to sell anyone for a profit on FM 2016 just wouldnt happen. But now I can sell Valencia to a Chinese club for 20 mil wow! and even enjoy bidding wars. The game feels good all round, tactics are reponsive and  you can really see the changes/tweaks you make translated on the pitch.  Drawbacks for me would be its caused my laptop to overheat a few times and shut down :-( it seems to run the fan at full speed while its running, its a bit annoying maybe if the devs cleaned thier code and did a bit of refactoring the game wouldnt be using up such a ridicoulously high CPU % and drain resources, my laptop is good enough to deal with it. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,2,0,0

												i know that 17 hours is not a lot of time to invest in a game but i've been playing fm/cm since yr 1 . so far this is proving to be the worst ever incarnation of my favourite game. team orders ignored, superstar goalkeepers only when your team is playing against them, work the ball into the box leading to assistat saying we're having lots of long shots, get stuck in got me 4 red cards in 1 matchI've been playing touch to get an idea of the play for the full game, but now i'm not even sure i want to try the full game if the ai is of the same ilk. i hope tht this is fm's idea of a quick fix for those of us that were waiting for the full game, and that the full game has decent ai etc if not then i'm going back to fm2011. at least that 1 worked properly			",56,19,1,12,11,0,23

												This game is awesome! I've played over 10 years in-game now and I'm enjoying every second of it. The last time I had this much fun in Football Manager was probably in 2006, but I've been a consistent fan of the product for many years now. In this Touch edition, I love how they streamlined everything. The instant sim is a very nice touch, especially since I'm married with a child. I've been playing soccer manager games since the DOS days back in 1992-93. AC Milan has been my favorite club for 25 years running now. It's really cool to hear AC Milan legend Paolo Maldini give me advice before matches on this game, considering that I managed him on DOS when I was 10 years old lol. This game is so exciting! I highly recommend it.			",2,14,0,6,16,1,2

												The game would be absolutely perfect if it wasn't for the slow match engine. I use 2D Classic and it's really jumpy, makes it unenjoyable to play. Strange as it ran really smooth on FM16 Touch. Every other aspect of the game is brilliant. Very quick prcessing and layed out really well.  Can reccommend if you can look past the poor match engine,			",0,0,0,0,3,0,0

												Yes, this has been separated from main game this year. But FMT 2017 is best FM as of now. Same match engine from full version but without unnecessary features. Just concentrate on your team and that's all. Few improvements might be needed like, team talk or motivation factor, a little bit detailed training... but nonetheless best ""pick up and play version"" of FM.			",74,123,1,26,18,0,42

												Hardest roguelike I've ever played, with no reward loop.  Doesn't matter what I do, I lose, then I get fired, then I get to do it again with the same broken tools.  I think the franchise has forgotten that it's a 'game', because it quickly stops being fun (unless you like rolling dice with the numbers rubbed off).EDIT:After my frustrated rant above, I started using 'Instant Result' and a light dawned.  The Match Plan feature makes a lot of sense when trying to understand what to do during matches.  It also helps explain a little better  why the 'Mentality' tactical options should be used, and how.Problem is, the ability to use a Match Plan is linked only to Instrant Result, and isn't something you can apply pre-game to a match you are about to manage yourself.  Having the Assistant tell you what changes you should make based on your chosen match plan would definately help the more caual player (like me!) get to grips with the mechanics, and even if you said 'yes' to everything, that would basically be the same as pressing Instant Result (with the added immersion you get from watchuing the match engine live).I will stand by my 'broken tools' comment, because there is a big gap between what your Assistant Manager can do with a Match Plan and Instant Result, and what feedback the Assistant currently gives you when you are watching it unfold live.EDIT 2:Good news:Found the Math Plan thing in the match engine!  It was in one of the top dropdowns all along, so that's good, I can now watch the match while my assistant does the donkey work.Bad news:The new tooltip which appears on the Match Plan wizard tells you it is for Instant Result matches and when you don't want to attend the game, so that's what has mislead me, hope they update it soon!Using Match Plans reveals new confusions, as it asks you to pick a starting strategy (I picked Contain/highly structured) which appears loud and proud at the top of your Match Plan summary, as if it's the foundation of your approach.  Problem is, I'd also picked 'play to win' as the template of the Match Plan, so every scenario (from kick-off) used something other than the contain/highly structured stuff I'd picked... so I'm not sure how all that's all working together.Also I've seen screenshots of the full game Tactics screen and it includes a Familiarity bar which tells you how competent your team are with your chosen tactic - a simple and useful piece of indormation that isn't on Touch! You get that info in a monthly email from your AM, but as a streamlined piece of info I'd say that's the sort of thing that Touch needs.. You can change tactics then go back to the email and the bar will have changed (along with the breakdown when you hover over it) but that's more a glitch than a feature.The Familiarity thing also got me thinking about how the Tactics and Match Plans tie together... the game asks you to train with one chosen mentality/team shape, but then rewards you for changing them up during matches, which is counter-intuitive - it's basically saying you will play better by picking unfamiliar mentalities during games, which makes the whole thing harder to fathom.  Seems to me that the whole training/familiarity thing should be around Match Plans, and not one particular tactic within a match plan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Football Manager Touch is a thoroughly enjoyably game and is perfect if you want to play the game but without the overwhelming interface, the majority of these negative reviews are by disgruntled Chinese buyers who want a Chinese language version, pay no heed to those reviews, this is a thoroughly enjoyable game and worth the amount you pay for it.

												If you used to stumble out your bedroom at 3am after a long Champ Man session when you were 15, but gave up playing the new ones about 10 years ago as they became slow, clunky, unresponsive and far too detailed to enjoy, don't buy this. Well, do if you're unemployed and have given up on life.. 30+ year old men should really resist, because it's just like the old days - simple, quick, but just about enough detail. I love it! And I should be doing productive things! My wife and kids just don't understand, and sadly neither do I anymore. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. But there are plenty of issues - I can't find a way to have more that 3 leagues actually running (is this right?!), which limits the fun, and there are a few bugs, but it's pretty solid. 7/10, and worth 15 quid. Hopefully I'll get bored soon.			",42,8,4,5,11,1,8
