Early Access Review
								Short version:Buy it if you prefer road racing sims to the more casual driving/racing games. Otherwise it's probably not for you. Also, no ovals currently.Long version:GeneralI'm no native Engish speaker. Automobilista (AMS) is Early Acces, but currently there is no racing sim that could be called a final product. So be aware that AMS and all the similar games are constantly changed, sometimes even introducing new bugs. I'm playing the game for quite a while, way before it came to Steam. The game is made by a small team and it seems that it's more about passion, than big money. It's not about being flashy, stylish etc., but about actual regulated car racing. No offense for NFS players, but this is the other end of the spectrum. It is true that AMS is based on rFactor 1, but it is much more than that.ContentThe game is rather obscure in this regard, but I personally like their picks. It started as a Brazilian Stock Car (which is a real thing) game, so the older content is Brazilian V8s and mostly Brazilian tracks. Over time they ventured into some popular and some less so areas, but most of the cars are quite different from each other. Many current games offer street cars, hypercars, GT3 and touring cars. AMS has Brazilian stock cars (60s, 80s and current), open wheel (old and new), fwd, rallycross, super trucks, and some more. Content is by no means mainstream. I didn't play much open wheel, but generally the cars feel authentic. I don't have any racing experience, but I'm driving probably before most Steam users were born. So yea, the cars feel really different. You sure don't drive the same a Formula Extreme and a Formula Vee. Night racing is supported, but no rain. Dynamic rubbering is on a Todo I think.Force FeedbackI have a Thrustmaster T500 + TH8 H shifter, so your experience may vary, depending on the wheel you use. This may be the best part of the game. I have all the actual racing sims and my personal experience is that no current game feels near to AMS regarding FFB, especially the later builds. This may be subjective experience, but it seems that the bigger the publisher, the worse the FFB gets (kudos to Codies/Dirt Rally, which is a rare exception). If you have driving experience, in AMS you can actually feel what is happening with the car (Neils' magic). Some of the more popular titles (that I'm playing too) are laughable in this area.AIDon't expect human behavior (carnage in T1), but racing with this AI is probably the most you can get if you play no MP. In most current sims, AI is questionable and this one is I had the most human-like races with. Be honest, even in the better ones, the first two laps are miserable. Here you see cars passing each other, passing you. On the other side, I didn't see any human-like mistakes (which I only saw in R3E). I've also been ocassionally divebombed, but no crazy AI flying all over the road or all AI pulled on a string.SPThe usual stuff. Training, race weekends and less usual, championships. There is no GT/AC/pCars like career. Championships are premade seasons for a car type. It is generally the same as rFactor1, except that the devs sometimes mess with the files and the championships don't really work, which is one of my main gripes with the game. For example in the current build, there are wrong (old) track names in the files and some series have 0 scoring. So without basic IT skills, you're doomed to wait for the devs.MPI only play that other game if I want actual MP racing without carnage, so I can't comment on this.VisualsDespite recently upgraded, visuals are a weak point. If you don't care about heat haze and sunrays, you'll be fine. But an AMS screenshot is like a photo of England on a regular day. SoundI find it that sound can get really subjective. I'm fine with sound in most racing sims.ConclusionMore for people who appriciate the older racing sims (GTR2, GTL, GPL etc) than posting a screenshot of your purple Huayra.PS I avoided mentionning other racing games where possible to avoid fanboys which unfortunately are a big chunk of racing sims/games communities.
