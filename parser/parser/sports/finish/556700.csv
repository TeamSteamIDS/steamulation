Early Access Review
								Currently worth about 5 bucks at most compared to what other games are offering. I was looking forward to this one, but I find the AI/punching mechanics to be worse than Thrill of the Fight or Drunk'n Bar Fight. Both of these gameshave more to them anyway. Both of those games offer a better experience as far as boxing/punching goes and they are priced about 50% cheaper.In the current flood of VR titles, $20 is simply way too much for what this game offers. 10 more dollars and you can get Arizona Sunshine. Something is wrong with that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								There's about no content nor decent gameplay with this game, at the moment feels like a joke.  Normally i don't write negative reviews but high price tag and deceiving game reviews took me here.			",248,77,13,3,29,6,1

Finally a real fighting game!Heavy Impact is a great take on boxing in VR. The game really shows how powerful room-scale tracking is and makes jumping around seem natural. When fighting, the robotic opponent acts how it should. It reacts and counters very nicely and doesn't let the player win with a cat-fight. Every blow is real and by extension the fights are too. While the game is in early access, there are very few bugs in sight. Heavy Impact could become one of the best VR fighting games.			",23,10,1,0,5,2,5

								not worth for the price.1 vs 1 is just playable. and quite funsurvival mode is very bad. I like the music and sound but gameplay need to be polished futher more.for me, only playable mode is 1 vs 1 and after single fightit's over.not recommend. it is way too expensive for its contents.thrill of fight is way better.
