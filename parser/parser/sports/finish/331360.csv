								Don't think about it, just give this game a chance. It's free, if you don't like it, just uninstall it.This game is one of the coolest most interesting concepts for a game I've seen in the past decade.I'm not going to compare this game to a MOBA or Twisted metal which is what every single review of this game does, instead I'm going to describe it all on it's own.Heavy Metal Machines is a 4vs4 team based Battle Racing game. There is one simple objective, capture the bomb from the center of the map, and deliver it to the enemy's base, but it's not as simple as it sounds. Each team has their own race track on their side of the map that the enemy team has to transport the bomb through and your job is to stop them from getting there, intercept the bomb from them, and turn around to race it to their side of the map. With a plentyful roster of drivers with their own unique vehicles to choose from, you build a team of 4 with each player trying to fill one of 3 roles, Transporter, Interceptor, and Support.The Transporter's skill set revolves around mobility and keeping posession of the bomb while ""transporting"" it to the enemy base.As an Interceptor, you will be dealing damage to the enemy team's vehicles in an attempt to protect your bomb carrier, as well as taking theirs out.And last but not least, The Support class is very important, you'll be shielding, healing, and dishing out crowd control to make sure your team delivers the bomb without a hitch, it's an invaluable role as well as a very satisfying and fun role to play.Imagine a scene from Fast and Furious or Mad Max where a convoy of vehicles is battling it out for control of a precious cargo, that's what this game feels like, and it is just as awesome as it sounds.Give this game a shot, you won't regret it.

								Today I got banned from a forum for 2 weeks so decided to find a new game to play.  Didn't know what to expect with this one, but it's free to play, open beta, so I decided to give it a shot.  Played almost 2 hours non-stop before my hand cramped up from having a death grip on the mouse. Trying to match with others online took too long, but I did make the attempt when most people were at work or school.Played with bots instead, became a big fan of Larry Givens.Announcer is very excited about his job.Game doesn't take up much space, it's quick to load, and a lot of fun.10/10 would get banned from that forum and throw myself into lava again.

								Awsome game but don't compare it to League of Legends  because in this game you don't have to farm a lane or care about your mana.. only thing you do is go for the objective watch your hp and cooldowns and have fun! This is a non-stop action game with cars like Twisted Metal. I'd say the only thing that is similar to LoL is that you got one unit to control with a top view and you aim for your skills shots! Fun Fact : -Everything in the game can be unlocked with the game currency even the skins ! -One of the only f2p game that deserve to be played there is no Pay-2-Win!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								If you can't find a match on North American servers, try queing on the European servers.A very fun game, but has a lacking player base currently. If you're a fan of the gameplay in older games like Rock n' Roll Racing or Death Rally, or like the style and over the top vehicles from Twisted Metal or Mad Max, then I think you should give the game a chance. Or, if you enjoy MOBAs, then you may find that Heavy Metal Machines is a breath of fresh air for the genre, its something incredibly different compared to most MOBAs. Very rarely does a good game in this style appear, but I think that Heavy Metal Machine has a lot of potential.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Absolutely love this game! Super addictive. It is like a mix between Twisted Metal and Rocket League is the best way I can explain it. Lots of team mechanics, plenty of customization, and a sweet soundtrack for each car. I can definitely see this going into competitive gameplay and events down the road. Rock on!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
