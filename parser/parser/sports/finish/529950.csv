												Very well polished multiplayer game. I have been playing it on my 10"" Intel Atom based tablet and the game has run flawlessly even when tested with 12 players (all me during testing) without any visible dipping in performance. PRO'S• The multitouch works great and the way the game handles assigning controls is really fantastic, it puts 12 tiles around the screen and players can tap whichever is closest to them to play. Since it is a single button game players just need to tap the edge of the screen in their area while playing. The game can be paused by tapping the centre of the screen.• On physical hardware controllers you can press any key on your keyboard and that will be assigned to a player, press it again to unassign it. Once again a very intuitive system.• The menu animations are also very very slick and make the game really easy to navigate.• The different gameplay modes are very easy to understand. This means there is a very low barrier for entry allowing anyone to play• However the game modes are also hard to master which makes them fantastic for competitive play.• Very low price. Goes without saying that the price is very very good, especially since it is a local multiplayer game meaning you only need to buy 1 copy to be able to play with many people.CON'S• The menu music is very repetitive, however you can turn it all off which is more ideal for playing with friends.• When the game is paused there is a 3...2...1... countdown timer when resuming, it takes far too long in my opinion. Half the time would still give everyone adequate time to get ready and in place.• Maybe it would also be nice to have an option to double the menu animation speeds. They are very nice but I find myself waiting for the animations to complete.• When using keyboard it would be nice if player colours were mapped to the screen based upon their location on a keyboard. This makes no effect to gameplay since the colours are only there for touch screen controls but it would have been a neat effect.• It would maybe be nice to slide my finger over the options in the settings menu rather than having to tap the arrows to adjust volumes. Not a big deal at all though since it is set and forget.• No online multiplayer, it would be neat to have. Its also a ballache to implement well so I can understand why it isn't here. So I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a simple fun local multiplayer game. It may seem like I have listed a lot of negatives but they are all very very minor things that have little effect on the gameplay.			",148,22,14,5,30,1,13

												This is actually a good game if you live with siblings or roomates that you can play with. You basically play with several people on the same computer, each person picks a key, and it becomes their control (you only need 1 button to control your orb). You spawn in as a certain color orb, and some ambient orbs spawn in at times, and are white. If you touch a white orb, it turns your color and kills other people who touch it. There are a few different gamemodes for this but they all have a similar principle. Good value for the dollar I paid for it, can play for maybe an hour at a time with several people to keep playing with.			",12,0,0,1,1,0,0

												12 orbits is a game that I recommend because:- it has a good price- it is indie & casual- it is colorful- it is a metod to banish boredom- it has action- it is abstract- it has multiplayer mode- it has a beautiful design- it has a good concept- it has trading cardsEnjoy!

												It's a very different game than the other games, didn't played it much, but I think it's really an awesome game that worth a try!. also it's a great game to kill time, and playing with your friends but only in one device. I wish they add multiplayer to play with other players around the world!!.			",325,69,9,28,16,5,25

												This game is really fun and entertaining for only using one button, and its definitely something you should pick up for its price. I've only got 3 players and it's pretty exciting and chaotic, I can't even imagine 12!12/12 orbits, will try to find more people to play			",47,3,0,2,1,0,1

												Wow. Wow, wow, wow. For this price, I have never played a game with this much quality. The 3D graphics are stunning and are sometimes not seen in games worth $5 or more. Again, the game is worth buying just for its quality. Not to mention the control screen is as easy as pressing a button. The game is as simple as that, too! However, we haven't even gotten to the actual game yet.So, what is the game, you ask?This game has 4 different modes with 7 total variations total. Arena and Trails are free-for-all modes, Blizzard and Multiball are team modes, and Arena, Trails, and Blizzard have practice variations. For every mode, there are 7-8 maps you can play on. On these map, there are circles of various sizes and location through it. After you select your button, you can press the button when in the circles to go around them in an orbit (hence ""orbits"" in the title). When you press your button outside the circle, you dash forward, which can be beneficial or hurtful, depending on the mode. You can always tell the direction of your character by looking at where the arow points. It never breaks physics, but it is helpful for when you have a lot of characters on the screen, and a small bit of color isn't enough to keep your eye focused. In addition, there are modifications for the four multiplayer modes, giving you flexibility and countless arangements of fun! Lastly, if you are in a circle and an opponent or sphere hits you, your orbit will break unless you hit your button immediately afterwards. Alright, let's go on to the modes! First, we will begin with Arena, which is probably what could be considered the basic mode. You have to direct your character towards various white spheres. When you hit one, every other player cannot hit them or thy die. The same goes for you if you hit an opponent's sphere. It is possible to change the color of spheres around you if you hit a big open circle. However, these are really uncommon, aren't seen until later in the game, and only have a certain radius from which all the spheres will become your color. It's a relatively simple mode.       (*_* )Secondly, we have Trails. In this mode, you have to pick up white spheres like before, but this time, they extend off of you wen you pick them up. You become a big snake, and you have to use your sphere segments to kill the opponent; hitting head-to-head with your opponent bounces the two players off one another. There are big open circles in this mode, too. In this mode, they steal any nearby white spheres or segments from other players and adds them to your length. The game functions on a first-to-five basis: First player to five wins... wins!Thirdly, we have Blizzard. Blizzard is different from other modes because it has a solid line down the middle, preventing you to leave your half. On the black line lie two spheres which can be hit from either side. The objective is to hit the white spheres into the goal on the other side. However, players can send spheres your way, too. You can defend by touching the colored spheres that head towards your goal. If you or an opponent miss, it is probable a goal will be scored. When a goal is scored, a line of the goal is taken away, making it tougher for that team to hit into it. It keeps the game balanced and exciting the entire time and gives the team that's down a chance to come back. It's also important to know that spheres hit out of the middle never despawn, but turn white after a goal is scored. This results in the screen being filled with madness come late game if you don't play your cards right!Lastly, we have Multiball. Multiball is like easy-mode Blizzard. There is no black line, so players can move throughout the map. You still defend and score in the same ways. However, there are some big changes. Goals are circular and don't take up the entire edge, so it is a little harder to score. You can hit your colored sphere into your goal, but it will not count against you and the sphere will rest in the middle. Lastly, an open circle spawns in the middle when two white spheres are    present, making it so a team could quickly posses both of them from the outset.Though there are practice versions of Arena, Trails, and Blizzard, they are based on endurance and a lot less fun then the actual game. If you have a friend, play the real game, not practice.This game gives remarkable value for $1.99. I am thouroughly impressed with what was accomplished with this game. It will be tough to find a great game like this for under $10, and I'm being serious here. I cannot thank the developers enough for making this, as my friends and I have had countless great moments with this game, with more coming long into the future. Dev(s), I love you. <3			",16,5,0,0,1,0,1

												Its a fun game that requires a lot of skill surprisingly, im only sad this game doesnt have massive multiplayer, me and my friend both have the game and sadly i cant play more with her because she lives pretty far.

												Good game if you have friends but if you are a loney ♥♥♥♥ then you should re-think your life because i am doing it right now. Luckly enough i got this game for 20 cents so it worth a try-------------------------------------Ok since dev and other people that see my review weren't happy about it so here my new review: This game allow you to play with your friends and your family up to 12 people with only 1 keyboard so you only need to spend 1.99$ and you can have fun with the other. But what i am not happy about it is the singleplayer mod hey don't get me wrong i know that this game isn't meant for single at all. Like i said i'm a loner and the only reason i got this game because i have the 90% coupon for this game. Recently i found 3 ways to play this game singlely just like i just create a singleplayer mode for myself and i litteraly got 6 achivements for that. Well to wrap up what i said i would recommend this if it wasn't for my loneliness but whatever a review is a review and i do what my mind tell me to do so i still don't recommend this--------------------------------------Overrall i'll give it 9/10 mutiplayer mod4/10 singleplayer mod7/10 graphics8/10 gameplay But despite what i said i think you should buy this i mean it good but if you are lonely(like me) then this game won't worth your time (PS I'm bad at english so if there are grammar mistakes then i'm sorry)			",22,1,0,0,1,0,0
