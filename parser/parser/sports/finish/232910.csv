												+ Simple and fun gameplay which is easy to pick up and learn, but hard to master. This is the kind of gameplay that only TrackMania can deliver.+ Very skill-based and competitive. No gimmicks or anything, it's all about shaving off milliseconds with precise and skillful driving.+ Tolerable community. Most of the time they show sportsmanship and are very fair.+ Lots of community created content. Also includes the Steam Workshop.+ User friendly track, car and replay editors to create said content.+ Great car physics.- Ubisoft decided it'd be a good idea to split the TM² environments into seperate games, which means that the already small player base is also split. The result? Less players, less servers. You won't have a problem though until you hit 60k ladderpoints - that's when you have to play on different servers to gain more. And those servers are rather dead.- Said car physics tend to mess up sometimes, but that's usually the map builder's fault.- 5min cooldown on official races is a bit too long. In fact, why do they even make you wait? You could simply pay with Coppers (the currency) in previous games to try again, however, this doesn't work here. So this makes it really tedious to get good times on official races.- The price tag. TMNF was free, while this is $10, even though it's pretty much the same game.TrackMania² Stadium is an updated version of TMNF, ported to the updated engine with ManiaPlanet. It's great, but I wouldn't recommend picking it up at its full price.8/10 ",582,79,29,50,49,3,30

												This game is pretty ridiculous. It's like the company asked a bunch of 4th graders to come up with ideas for a racing game, and this is the result. Wall rides, loops, huge jumps, crazy speed. It's awesome.That being said, the skill cap is infinitely high. Yes, it's massively fun to go on a server and smash through a bunch of new tracks, crashing all over the place and hitting walls like they owe you money. And it's worth mentioning that since the multiplayer is almost exclusively user-created levels, there are tens of thousands of maps to play. But once you settle in to a server and have learned the maps, then it becomes a wonderfully technical game about shaving off bits of time where you can.A notable game mechanic, for those unaware, is that in time attack mode (probably the most popular game type, that and Rounds) you can reset to the beginning of the track (or the last checkpoint) at any time. This is a bit of departure from many other racing games. You'll just have a set amount of time (usually 5 to 7 minutes), to get a single best run possible. This makes it so that you never have to waste time finishing a run when you've already messed up, you can just reset and start fresh immediately. Makes for a much more efficient practice regimen, and resulting rate of improvement.There are three environments within TrackMania 2 (Stadium, Valley, Canyon), but within each environment is an abundance of variety in itself. Since this review is Stadium, I'll focus on that briefly:-Track materials: Pavement, Dirt, Grass, Water-Game Modes: Time Attack, Rounds. Probably others, but rarely used. RPG, I suppose.-Track Types: FullSpeed (because braking is for losers), Tech (because fullspeed is for neanderthals), Dirt (because you are full of self-loathing), Speedtech (Because you're a well-balanced individual with many friends and a winning smile).Seriously, the infinite permutations of tracks alone makes this game worth it.The End			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Addictive. Surprisingly addictive. I bought this expecting 5 hours max of gameplay. I would drive around in my car a little bit, crash into some wall, then go. Honestly, looking at the name and trailers, I wasn't really expecting a great game. I was so wrong. This game is great. The tracks, the concept, the art, even the music. Everything about this game was done right.  The levels aren't repetative so you won't get lulled into a bored repetitive leveling. No, each level has its own new quirck and obviously a new track. If you are going to buy this, be prepared to start honing your keyboard driving skills because this fast-paced game will require skill. But skill that you won't mind training for because it is such a fun game.			",110,14,4,11,27,2,8

												I started playing the Trackmania series back in 2009, By the time i got my 1st gold medal, i knew it was one of my all-time favourite games. Instead of choosing a set car or track, Nadeo lets the players create their own experiences, with multiple creation tools such as creating a track or painting a car. Trackmania is a very competitive game, most racing will be decided by 1 or 2 milliseconds. Trackmania is not about who has the best car, its about who is the best racer. I highly recommend this game, it is one of the best racing games i have ever played.			",164,8,25,9,9,1,31

												My most favorite and most played game of all time spending over 2000 hrs on Trackmania Nations, some more thousand on Trackmania United and also on the Forever expansion for both of those games. I have a long history with this game and it will always be in m heart. The developers are cool guys and ive had the honor to meet them on several occations, including their 10 year anniversary at the Ubisoft HQ where we, the invited, played against the developers where we crushed them.I can't say more about the game itself because I straight up ♥♥♥♥ing love it. Especially the tools. ..and also the gameplay. Trackmania 2 Stadium doesn't do much new other than upgrading the engine, adding a few new block types and upgrading the mediatracker. The single player by Papychampy is probably the best campaing they have made. The gameplay is still the same, (which is good though) but has a constant flow of new maps every day to keep it entertaining. This is the reason why I can still jump into the game and play some maps, 9 years later. Though since the original (and expansion) was free, I have no problem paying for this game. Sadly the game isnt what it used to be, because a lot of the core community players have fallen off the rails. This game was fun because of the community. People made a lot and was very creative. You could join clans just to have fun, which made me play it for at least 6 hrs a day back in 2006. My one reccomendation doesnt justify how much this game is to me. ",124,13,6,10,16,0,8

												The original TrackMania games were damned amazing and had a great following with tons of servers full of thousands of players at any given time of day. For the last ten months, the new TrackMania games have been dead. I paid full price for all three titles, expecting to have an even better time with the new games, because why not?Well, as the days turned to weeks, I realized the folly of my wasted money as almost all of the servers remained dead across the planet and it continued to be impossible to find a choice of heavily populated servers. Whether it was the dumb choice to milk the players of their cash by splitting the game up into three separate releases (one for each environment) and requiring separate servers for each or if it was the decision to charge money for the new games, at all, the result remains the same -- nobody plays these.If you reference SteamCharts[steamcharts.com] for Stadium, you'll find that the average number of players at any given time through all of 2013 was between 90 and 190. Across the entire planet - and most usually seem to be overseas (Germany, France, Russia, Spain, the UK), so if you're looking for a populated low-ping server in your region and you're in North America, you're going to have a bad time.It's a very unfortunate situation. The game looks better than ever and it has a lot of enjoyment to offer if you like this style of game. It's a fantastic time waster when you need a break here and there. However, you ultimately need a player-base for a multi-player game to be enjoyed. Their business and release model for this series of games completely failed in this way, this time around.Here's to hoping they give the franchise another shot in a couple more years and they correct their mistakes.

												TrackMania Stadium is a solid high-speed multiplayer racing game that puts you against the clock with other players across the world simultaneously. TrackMania is a game about precision. If you are looking for a racing game with crashes and power-ups, this is not for you. TMS has a large surplus of maps with various difficulties. Almost every track involve a very large amount of skill to pull of fast times. TMS has a single-player mode and it's pretty basic. You competing against yourself to get bronze, silver or gold medals. The single-player is here to enhance your ability to do better on courses and to make you even better at the game. The money is well spent when you play multiplayer.There are a ton of servers that are up across the world. All ranging from U.S. to Germany to Japan. I was amazed by how the servers ran, even with over 50 people. Obviously, this was needed as this type of game relies on time based racing. It's exhilerating to go at a such high speed and making perfect turns as you barely beat the opponent who is ahead of you. You actually feel like you are going extremely fast and it makes the game challenging and pretty addicting at certain times. The graphics in TMS aren't amazing compared to TrackMania Valley, but they get the job done as well as the audio. The controls aren't totally perfect, but they're responsive enough to give you a chance of making some really good times.I'm not that great at the game, but these last 7 hours have improved me as a player and I can only learn from the professionals around me. PROS:+High Speed Time Trials+Great Amount of Tracks+Solid Controls+Good Community with a large surplus of servers+Decent Price+Excellent Frame-rate with very rare connection issues+Skill BasedCONS:-Can get tedious on occasion While I only have one con, that bullet is very important. I rarely find myself playing TMS for more than an hour on any given time which isn't that great of a thing. Although, TMS is a solid game nonetheless.

												Trackmania 2 Stadium is a casual arcade racing game,like the Trackmania 1 series before it,it has a massive online following of players and modders,online leaderboards for country and region and an unlimited amount of tracks to race on,Trackmania 2 series is more of an updated version of the original game with a new graphics and sound engine,a more streamlined interface geared towards simplified ingame downloadable content and trying to combine the other expansions of the trackmania series together.The old Trackmania games could be purchased as several different themes,sunshine,nations,united and forever,these were separate games with the same racing only set in different locals and racing car types,like F1 rally,exotic.There are also a few other versions on the game that combined everything together as one purchase called united nations.The original is old,it's pricing structure and layout was a mess but the game was very good in it's own right however it would never be recommended over the Trackmania 2 series these days.Trackmania 2,so for the new updated game,it has now been split into three games,Stadium,Canyon and Valley -F1-STOCK-RALLY each of these games have their own locale and racing style,each of these games are superb in their own way and now these three games are tied together with the new menu system.The gameplay is very arcade,these games use for example the rally theme in a very loose sense to make up the look and sound of the game but overall,all three games are of the Trackmania style of gameplay,a gameplay all on it's own.Gameplay consists of racing without racing !,you racing on the games tracks or the user created tracks that can resemble something from FZero or Micromachines or Hotwheels,you race simply for the race record and you race against your own and everyone else's ghost car,when you play online you are also racing against online players ghost cars,they are playing in real time but you can't crash into them as there is no collision,if there were collision then the game would simply not work as you can be racing along side as many as 400 other players at the same time of any given track !This is a very casual pick up and play,have fun and turn off again game but it's also a very skillful game,also a very exciting game that looks and sounds great to boot,it doesn't matter what version of the game you buy,stadium canyon and valley all offer the same level of skill and fun.So I would recommend everyone play this game,it's the PC racing game that everyone should own a copy of,I will break down the differences of each of the three games in preference as my opinion below.Trackmania Stadium -You can't go wrong with stadium as it's the base game,the original and the best and has a f1 style car,and roads and track set similar to something like hot wheels and fzero,good traction on the road see's your car doing loop the loops and crazy wallrides,a very fast game and the number one choice over the other two.Trackmania Canyon -The weakest of the three but it's really really fun,as good as the others but just not the best,however there is a certain amount of skill involved with canyon that pushes it further than vally and stadium,handling is similar to ridge racer making for very fast laptimes and the official trackmania contest finalists play canyon over the other two,i can understand why ! Trackmania Valley - the best looking of the three as it's engine was tweaked as the locale has more going on,more detail and simply just amazing looking ! Valley is the middle ground of the TM games,it feels more like stadium with more traction on the road,but ultra fast like canyon but doesn't offer anything really different apart from being an all round great game,however there are some other things about valley that do stand out and that's in it's level track design,the editor has a little more scope for making day and night time tracks,forrest tracks and underground tracks that can have you driving through mountains,i would say it's the middle ground and having all the of the best features of the two before it you would think it's the best of the bunch but it just isn't ! not a thing wrong with it but it still can't beat stadium. I would always recommend Stadium as the starting game,it's the cheapest of the three and the core game is there,the other two are just as good but I would say Stadium is the best of the three,with stadium you do not even need to ever play the other two games,the other two are for those who can't get enough of the Trackmania series and it's also good to change out every now and then for something s bit different to race on.CONSThe game like soo many others are not without problems,many bugs have already been sorted but I found the Trackmania series in particular to have some very backwards design ideas/flaws,for the most part this game and it's expansions will run 60fps+ on the very high graphical settings,some settings still slow it down like motionblur but thankfully you can turn all details from off,low,med,high,the vsync options are not very well explained as there are six options for vsync as well as triple buffering and first time users won't know the correct/best setup,I will say now that you should use vsync,also use every third frame (not constant frame) and also use triple buffer and this should give you a proper 60fps,water shader detail for medium pc's should be med or low,and motion blur would be recommended as off,there are many other options in the start up menu and you should take the time in setting these up,resolution is very important in this game,i found that lower resolutions are fine but you really miss the graphical details so I would recommend you aim for 1080,full frame rate with vsync options and then turn up other details to see what you can get away with.Other problems with the game are the lack of support,this game is made by a French company and the forums and users are mostly EU users,there's not as many users from the uk and usa on the forums,that doesn't mean there are not many users from uk and usa playing the game,just means we try to avoid the unhelpful forums as I found I didn't get anywhere when asking for help.The game's layout,the way the game works can be quite strange as well,you earn points for scoring high,these points are called Planets ? your planets are displayed in the top bar when you are in the main menu,these Planets are then used to buy online user created content,you earn a little planets each day that you play as well,another thing that seems backward to me is the apparent new menu system that combines everything together (it doesn't actually work) after all the time this game has been out it still is broken but since an update a month ago it is now working outside of steam but the steam version is still unworking,this means that if you own two or more of the trackmania games,you need to exit out the game and start then other one up from steam ( not a big deal really)Overall this game is amazing,be prepared to spend some time on the game,take your time and mess about in the menus and try to get used to the way the Trackmania system works,playing the game for the first time gave me the feeling of (wtf have I just bought ?) it took me a while to understand the games charm,I was expecting far too much from the game and when I couldn't really GET the concept of the game along with the many problems I faced in trying to find out what Planets are and why my planets would disappear without buying content or sometimes I would buy content and lose my planets but not receive my item,I found it very hard in finding the answers on google or the mania forums,little things like this can really put you off a strange game and concept like this one,but give it a go and you will find it hard not to fall in love with this game,it's a classic reborn and in my opinion one of the best hardcore/arcade racers you can get !10/10			",336,111,30,45,20,2,47

""5 reasons why 'Celebrat10n TrackMania2 Pack' is a disappointment!""#1 Limited edition Modding:  Anthodev [developer]; ""Do you know that TM Unlimiter is abandonned on Trackmania² because we have developed our own TM-Unlimiter like tool in Maniaplanet available to the players?

												It's hard to review a game like this...The product's quality is astonishing.Perfect game, perfect graphics, perfect online, perfect editor.The only issue is that, this package, is mostly similar to the ""Trackmania Nations Forever"" one, which is free, or to the ""Stadium"" mode of ""Trackmania United Forever"".So if you're a new fan of the trackmania universe buy this game right away, but if you already play on the Stadium (standard) or Nations packages, you might avoid buying this one (Though i still recommend getting it, if you have the money).I hafve to say that this package adds some brand new cool blocks to the editor and Nadeo's tracks are something amazing!For the first time playing the single player really is an enjoable experience aswell.I recommend the game.

												If you are one of the many who picked up Trackmania Nations Forever for free, you'll instantly recognise this title. It plays just the same, very easy controls, very difficult to master, and almost impossible to put down. Graphically it's far superior to the original (hardly surprising) although with everything moving so fast it's difficult to really spot a lot of the graphical improvements, apart from those on the car itself. Well worth the fiver it costs, even though Trackmania Nations Forever is free. I'd recommend downloading the original game, treating it is a demo, and if you like that, you'll consider this an essential purchase.			",211,16,19,31,27,0,62

												i have to say, i'm biased, this game strikes an emotional chord with me. im really into cars and racing. it's 11/10, the best arcade racer i have ever played.this game requires a gamepad. srsly dont use a keyboard you'll break it. i use a wired xbox 360 conroller.with that, the main thing about this game is it's gameplay. it is extremely difficult. this is not an easy game to be good at. lap time is king. you will be timed from when you exit the gate to when you have driven through all  checckpoints. you will see other players knock in times at the top of leaderboards that you'll scratch your head and say ""how in the world did they do that?"" this game requires a lot of practice and a lot of crashing into walls to become proficient. at the time of this review, i have 230 hours in trackmania 2 but that is not representative of my skill. i have over 1000 hours in the game before this one, Trackmania Nations Forever. I am an elite player in the north american scene, but i practice mainly on French servers. why, you ask?the community for this game is focused where real life motor racing is king: europe. I practice in the French scene because the French dirt scene fits my style of play: fast paced, high slip angle rallying with tons of ridiculously difficult jumps. you have to flip through the servers to find a group of maps and people that fit your style of play, and that takes a couple hundred hours.i want to say: its worth it. if you take the time to become good at drifting at all speeds (at least 500 hours for me) then you will discover a deep, involving gameplay experience that sucks you in and begs you to take that corner just a little bit faster, to drift harder, to look down the road and wonder, ""how fast can i REALLY go?"" ""can i make the bonus jump this time, or will i settle for the regular jump? i need 200 more KPH!""that is why i love this game. i hope you will too.			",66,2,9,0,0,0,2

												Trackmania² Stadium is a game with endless posibilities. you can build your own tracks so the game will never get boring.the playerbase is not that big, but there are always a solid 200 people online and i don't see it dropping very soon.The graphics aren't the greatest but the gameplay totally makes up for it. And the best of all is: You don't have to be a pro-gamer to have fun with it, you can always try to beat your own records instead of going for the #1 spot, with local and dedimania records. Alot of servers also have custom music playing, which is pretty cool! The community is also very friendly, you hardly find people insulting eachother. Which is pretty rare these days.for $9,99 the game is very well worth it.Graphics: 7,5/10Replay value: 9,5/10gameplay fun: 9,5/10optimalization: 9/10audio: 7/10Community: 9/10price/worth: 10/10Total: 9,5/10This is actually my first review ever on Steam.

												For anyone unfamiliar with Trackmania, here's a quick overview:- Tracks are built out of prefab pieces, kinda like lego (but obviously with race track shapes instead of rectangles).- Cars cannot collide with other cars.  You cannot run other players off the road in this game.- In multiplayer, you're in a simultaneous time-trial competition with the other players, but sometimes there are other goals... such as simply being able to finish a very difficult track or a specially crafted stunt-oriented track at all.Generally speaking, this is a game for perfectionists, speed seekers, and stunt lovers.The main benefit of this game over other racing games is that you can jump into an already-running multiplayer server at random, encounter new tracks that you've never seen before as well as ones you've mastered, and have people to compete with, pretty much any time you want.

												This game will yield hours and hours of fun. I shouldn't be so quick to call it a game though; It's more of a sport. There are few controls other than stop, go, turn, and restart, but don't think for a second that there is no room for improvement. The game engine catches every slight turn of the wheel for split second victories or losses. The community is great too; there are countless custom tracks that refuse to let this game become stale. WELL worth the price.			",66,29,1,12,4,0,5

												If you like TMUF, you're gonna like this... it's pretty much the same only upgraded graphics and new car sounds (and yes, a few new blocks if you like building tracks).This is still hands down, the best, most competitive racing game on PC, and probably on all platforms.Easy to learn, very hard to master. Good for casual racers, good for competitive players... everyone gets what he/she wants.Only downside for me is the fact that the publisher does not at all push this game as an e-sport, while it is still played at most LAN's and e-sport events... and the playerbase is pretty huge for a racing game. The potential is there to be much larger, but unfortunatly Nadeo/ubisoft does not seem interested...Other then that, great game, great tournaments, great community.I've been playing Trackmania pretty much since it came out, about 10 years ago, and still play its almost every day :)			",84,9,4,6,10,2,4

												I never really got into the Trackmania series... A friend of mine made me buy it years ago (he loves it). I didn't like racing with keyboard, I disliked the casual arcade style, I disliked the very short races.  I found a whole bunch of things to dislike and noted them in order of priority (that list has been lost now, perhaps thrown away inadvertently).  2015 is drawing to an end, and having recently purchased an Oculus DK2: I downloaded the demo of Trackmania Stadium.  I can tell you that Trackmania with Oculus is a whole new experience! The graphics are beautiful in stereoscopic 3d. The visuals are very sharp, beautifully lit and it all looks very real. Not even the slightest hint of judder (running in extended mode 6.0.1. runtime windows 8, Nvidia 680).I think HMD VR has the unique ability of being able to reveal to you the beauty of a particular game you couldn't fully appreciate without it. When playing games the conventional way through a TV or monitor - you're seeing that game world from a distance (through a small window). With VR you are projected into that world - everything is life size. You tend to notice things and feel immersed to a degree not possible even with the best 4k monitor or large screen TV.  Control-wise it's nice to see Trackmania automatically detect my Saitek X52 Pro so I can use the joystick for racing (I haven't had to configure anything!). Much nicer than key-presses.Racing in 3rd person with Oculus is mind-blowing (3rd person was also on my dislike list in the past).  You get to see all of the detail in the game and the tracks are jaw-dropping. I find myself looking up at the sky or at the intricate scenery. I would say this is one of the best VR experiences you can have.  In an instant I have converted from someone who didn't like the game (previous versions), to someone who thinks it's stunning and hopes Nadeo convert their entire series to VR. Yes, for every Trackmania game released with VR support: I will buy and recommend to others.Trackmania is a great example of a game that reveals its true beauty through VR...Nadeo should be very proud of this creation.

												Definitely not the game I thought it was. I knew it was whacky but found out there was a bit of seriousness behind the scenes. Watching the previews I got the sense it would be similar to HotWheels Turbo Racing in which players were able to maneuver the cars in mid-air. This is not the case here; you'll need to time and calculate your speed, angle and take-off.The gameplay within this game is pretty rock solid. Although simplistic in nature, the game delivers a solid driving experience. The steering is tight but feels closely to the stiffness of an F1 car. The acceleration feels like you're speeding up and gaining momentum. Complete the former two with outlandish tracks with extremely tight and fun turns makes it almost into a complete game. The career mode in this is a bit odd. It seems as though the game was meant to be played online but can provide just as much fun offline. The only catch here is you're not really racing. You are, but you're not. Most of the career races involve time attacks. There are races which are lapped but for the most part it's time attack. Some gamers may find racing by yourself is a bit of a nuisance, even for single player mode. Again, online there can be multiple people on the track at the same time but in time attack, you'll be racing a ghost. Completing each race challenge results in attaining either a bronze, silver or gold card depending on your performance. The game is good enough that single player does not feel like a grind (in my opinion). Record breaking times are kept for each individual track and gives the player a ghost to play against.To maximize time and acceleration, it's best to try and keep straight and avoid jumps. This will be unavoidable as the tracks go from a linear build to some extremely crazy turns and loops. The race starts in a straight line. Then some turns will be thrown in. Next thing you know you're driving sideways then into a loop-to-loop. One thing to note is that when you drive through a loop, it switches to first person view. This may drive some nuts as a quick view switch is sort of unexpected. The tracks themselves can change from concrete, to grass or to gravel/dirt (which significantly effects turning controls). I find for most turns simply letting go of acceleration can work but there are cases where you'll need to specify which brake type to use. The hard brake slide/stop will bring your car quickly to a halt for sharp turns while the hand brake will allow you to maintain speed while sliding. Additionally, being in the air can cause quite some complications. If taking off isn't done right, sometimes the car won't land properly or spin out of control. There is an ""air-brake"" sort of feature in which you need to hold acceleration but tap the brake button in the air. Doing this tries to halt your movement. If you take a jump poorly, most likely you'll end up with poor results.What isn't advertised is the fact that (I'm assuming all) Trackmania is local co-op. There is an option for local play which can include up to four players. The players are sort of limited in choice regarding game mode. The only mode available is ""round"" in which the first player across the finish line wins. On top of this, if you do manage to complete all the courses and do get tired of local and multiplayer, the devs have been kind enough to include a solid track editor into the game. Want an entire track full of loops? Go ahead and go nuts. Just be aware that the cars need enough acceleration to make it through certain points! Adding a speed boost can definitely help reduce free-falls. A helpful tip to a possible future game would be to not fight against the games physics. The ""A"" button on a 360 controller holds the car steady in mid-air. Don't get your landing angle right and face the consequences. Also, drift is sort of possible in dirt. The graphics are pretty good for a game with a bit of age. Everything seems to have a nice polish and colors mesh nicely together. Not to mention, the back drop of being in a giant stadium is neat. The only thing that's extremely bothersome for me is not being able to see the nose of the F1 car in first person view. Sounds are generic and are decent. There isn't much to talk about here either than the sounds play/change at the right times (when you change track from concrete to grass) and the engine sounds are decent.Overall, it's a decent game for what it is, an outlandish track game. It's not exactly a racing game per se, but it will give any racing fan something to play.RATING : 7.1/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability C+ Overall  B-ScreenShots : Even for a dated game, the visuals are still nice There are a lot of obstacles to go over, under and through Racing a ghost Lovely view Look well through the menus for local play Course selection screen ",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

												Trackmania is the most fun I've ever had playing a game in a LAN environment. It is multiplayer time trials. Everybody is racing at the same time, for the best time. You cannot directly interact with the other cars but you can see them and you are competing with them. Most tracks are only about 30 seconds long and you get about 5 minutes to get the best time possible. All the while you know how well your competitors are doing and see them racing besides you. It is a very intense and fun experience.Trackmania 2 Stadium is the direct sequel to Trackmania Nations Forever and includes an updated engine with much better graphic, a nicer user interface, better multiplayer, more tracks, and a more active community. It is all about speed and crazy tracks with loops and fast curves.The other Trackmania 2 games, Canyon and Valley, feature different environments. Canyon is more on-road racing with wider tracks in a beautiful desert environment. Canyon also includes nicer-looking cars which show damage when you hit things. Valley, which I have not yet played, features more off-road driving. All games have the capabilities to create your own tracks or download pre-made tracks from the Internet.I recommend starting with Trackmania 2: Stadium as it is the cheapest and most popular environment. Trackmania Nations Forever is free on Steam if you want to try out the original.			",448,132,27,81,60,6,125

												The price you're going to pay will be for the service of Maniaplanet that offers you editor plugins, import of custom blocks, creation of title packs, monthly updates etc. that weren't available in the free version.So if you're going to use any of those services, the price will be worth, otherwise you will waste money to be in a version less crowded than the free version.Note that TMN ESWC servers are still open and that if you want to play TMN Forever without FreeZone you need to buy TMU Forever for 30 €.As some reviews, this is for the fans of the serie, if you only enjoy driving on your own maps, keep playing on the free version.

When racing is turned into acrobaticsTrackMania² Stadium has to be one of the better racing games that is out there. Not because of the simulation like mechanics but rather because of its unrealistic gameplay.TrackMania² Stadium is all about going fast and driving through different kinds of tracks ranging from Acrobatic tracks to more classic Endurance type of tracks. There's quite some variety with the built in tracks that the game comes with. Each and every track feels unique and doesn't really use any old mechanics or tricks from previous tracks. You can clearly see thought was put into making the tracks for the base game. All the different track types usually have a couple of trick that you need to learn in order to master them and get the fastest time which adds a lot of replayability to the game. You most likely won't succeed with your first try on the tracks which is fine because the tracks are usually short and fast so it's not really that common for you to try out a track for tens, even hundreds, of times to perfect your run.While I do like the tracks that were built in to the game by Nadeo, the developers of the game, I still do think the genuine fun factor comes from something a little different. Not much, just little. What I'm talking about is the Track Editor which lets you build your own tracks and share them with everyone on the internet. There are thousands of tracks to choose from so if you ever master all of the Nadeos tracks you will not run out of tracks to play after that.TrackMania² Stadium is a close to perfect game in my books. It's fast, fun, challenging and has a level editor in it with easy and advanced tools to create more levels for everyone to enjoy. TrackMania² Stadium is a must play if you are a fan of arcade type of racing games that do not care about realism. TrackMania² Stadium is simply amazing game.For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here! ",383,57,14,26,17,4,19

												Very addictive game with a dedicated community. Single player is all about beating challenging tracks in a certain amount of time much in the ways of Trials games. Join others in multiplayer and race around some of the coolest tracks made by the community in a race for the best times, some of the tracks gave me that feel of when I was a kid trying to build some badass Hot Wheel tracks. The track editor is amazing by the way. The community is welcoming and friendly, never had any issues. Their is a leaderboard system that doesn't only keep track of you world placing but also you country and local placing. Like Im canadian so it would tell me my rank in the world, Canada, and even my province placing.

												Have been playing TrackMania's franchise since 2009 (TrackMania United and TrackMania²) and have more than 5000 hours on United and around 150 in TM2, counting those that I launched game outside Steam. I can assure you this game has everything you would want. Do you like technical maps? You can have them. Do you want fast maps? You can play them.  Do you want tracks that look ridiculously stupid? You can have a good time. Do you want to challenge yourself? There are plenty of tracks to test your skill. You do not like your car, I see... No problem, you can download users content and rock a fancy new car.There are unlimited possibilities to enjoy this game. I recommend it, not only for being able to have good runs or being part of worldwide leaderboards, but for being such a good community with plenty of great people to enjoy your time.

												I watched a review of the new Trackmania game but since I was so cheap and didn't want to pay 40 bucks for Turbo, I installed this one. The graphics look decent enough and the gameplay is a lot of fun. The cars behave really well and it is the only racing game I would rather not play with a gamepad (and so shouldn't you). It is definetly worth the 10 bucks, I would say. There are two other Trackmania 2 games - Canyon and Valley. I have no idea if they are better or worse. But they are definetly twice as expensive.

												The oldschooled game is back!With a few new blocks, physics and ofcourse new graphics. Nothing big has changed since TrackMania Nations Forever, bugs are still a particularly problem in this game for competetive drivers and other useres, so it is a bit dissapointing that nobody worked or to be tried to fix those bugs instead of this we have now more bugs in this game than before!On the otherside we have the fun that made TMNF to us back. Another cool feature is that you can switch over the Maniaplanet platform through the different games and enviroments and can also download free and community made titlepacks and this is the quality of this game. TrackMania has a very good community which is very active and friendly,there are not just titlepack who are edited by the communtiy, the community edits new gamemodes and blocks.Overall i can really recommend this game, for the oldschooled players it will feel a bit strange because the car feels a bit heavier but it´s still a nice TrackMania			",14,0,1,0,10,0,6

												I was surprised by how much I enjoy this game!  The car is fast, and most of the tracks are great fun!  I like how most of the races are quick, like under 2 minutes.  One thing I hate about racing games is long multi-lap races that take a long time to re-do if you have to make first place.  This game has a lot of variety in the tracks, and most of them are really fun.  Some of the tracks are lame and don't have any clear direction to go, you have to search around using trial and error.  The menu system UI is very odd and lacking, but not a deal breaker.  The default xbox360 controller layout is very odd, I may customize it to a normal racing game layout later.  Anyways, this is the only one in the series that I have played, and I recommend picking it up on sale sometimes!			",874,233,34,93,134,7,143

												It's literally the same thing as Trackmania Nations Forever, which is still available on Steam and completely free.I guess if you really want to play a free game but in HD, go for it.Oh wait, no. Don't actually. Install the demo, it allows you to play on official servers and compete in official maps. You'll pretty much get the full experience that way. If you really want to buy a Trackmania title, try one of the other Trackmania2 games. Canyon in particular has a neat drifting gimmick and looks a lot more visually interesting.

												I've played TrackMania when I was younger and I really liked it. It has everything for everyone. It's simple and fun so kids can pick it up and start playing within minutes and it's challenging enought for older audience. I think I spent about 100+ hours with this game when I was younger. The multiplayer is fun and simple. The only thing I don't like is the turning. It's not that sharp. But as a kid I didn't even notice it after a few hours of playing. The levels are really well made. This is the type of game in which you need to restart a level a couple of times until you get the gold. And the levels never get boring. All in all this is a well made game that offers a lot of fun and hours of playing.  9/10			",28,7,0,1,13,0,0

												It's the Stadium environment everybody loves, adapted to work in the Trackmania 2 engine, so everything looks and sounds way nicer! Like, surprisingly so! For a game so simple, a lot of attention was paid to subtle sound and visual cues that really give the Stadium cars a realistic feel to them, even though technically very little about them was changed over the previous Trackmania game.The game comes with Steam Workshop support, but Stadium 2's short time on earth hasn't been kind to it. A lot of what I tried from the Workshop just plain doesn't work anymore. More than half the cars I downloaded give me an ""OldGeometry"" error when I try to load them, suggesting they're either for an older version of Trackmania 2, or were uploaded for the wrong game entirely.But yeah, it's more Trackmania Stadium, aka the best time trial/stunt racing game ever! That's great! But... it *could* be better.			",444,83,23,36,20,4,52

												Trackmania is one of the best racing games I've played. If you're looking for a single player story, then this is definitely not where you should look. However, if you enjoy multiplayer or a competitive atmosphere, then this game is perfect. The official multiplayer servers are fun for beginners looking to race with others and improve their skills. For those who already have some experience and are looking to up the ante, there are private servers with tons of custom maps that span all difficulty levels. In addition to the expensive custom scene, there is an intense competitive scene where you can watch pro's make difficult tracks look easy. As an avid e-sports fan and gamer, this game is great for hours of entertainment.			",127,19,5,6,13,0,5

												Why so much time on what looks like a pretty basic, arcady, and completely unrealistic racing game?Well, after 3k+ hours, there are probably about 3k+ reasons. Let me try and pick a few.First off, this is very much skill-based. Even on the 'silly, luck' tracks (which I'll come to in a moment). Play online, and you'll find pro-level gamers showing almost unbelievable levels of skill and achieving the seemingly impossible. But it's not impossible - this is a very fair game. Any cheating is caught and eliminated pretty quickly. All the cars have the same spec, there is no car-to-car collision to mess up your times. It's (mostly) just you, and a track, and your level of skill that determine how well you do.Next, the variety. The track creator provided allows an almost limitless tracks, and the community has produced masses of content. This obviously varies enormously in both style and quality, but since you are generally only on any given track for 4-5 minutes, if you don't like one you just wait it out and see if the next is more your kind of thing. And probably, in those 4-5 minutes you'll try it anyway and still get sucked in to try and beat your own times at the very least.[continued in comments]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 What is Trackmania² Stadium?Although I never actually got to play the original TrackMania or its successor ""Sunrise"" for any part, I regard Stadium as one of the best TrackMania games in the series. Essentially, this game is an arcade racer where you compete against the clock to see who can get the fastest time around the track. However there is a twist, if you're playing online, then be prepared to compete against 50 other people who are trying to do the same thing as you!  It's a Ubisoft game... Will I need a UPlay account to play?Not really... You'll need a Maniaplanet account to play online, unless you're just interested in playing the game offline, then you won't need an account at all, but I highly recommend that you make an account. What's the customisation like in-game?Absolutely limitless! So you can create tracks in the track builder and then share them to the Steam Workshop, or share them to the ManiaExchange website which is the biggest collective of user-created tracks. As well as this, you can create skins for your cars, which includes colours and paint-jobs for the stadium car, as well as entirely different models for your car.Is racing against the clock the only thing you can do?Nope. There are a lot of user-implemented modes in this game. Some great examples are NASCAR, (you drive around ovals at break-neck speeds) RPG (which is essentially a very large track that can take from 5 minutes to an hour to complete) and the likes of other fantastic modes!How's the online community?In my opinion, the online community is the best part of the game. Back in the day, I used to play this game religiously and made loads of friends on the LOLMAPS server. (if you play on there a lot, what up it's Mumbles!) There's also an e-Gaming community behind this game, so if you think you're pretty good at this game, you can crank it up a notch and compete against the REAL good players.Do you recommend this game?Yes I do! If you manage to pick it up on the cheap, then even better! I also recommend trying out Canyon, Valley, Turbo and United Forever if you liked this game. ",55,6,9,12,6,2,3

												This game is known to everyone who likes racing and stunts.I used to play the nations forever in the past, created hundreds of tracks ( most where weird ones) and spent many hours on it. Now with the stadium I can make better creations in better graphics.In trackmania stadium you race in solo or multiplayer against other peoples times. It is an amazing ""you vs everyone"" racing game in which you get to run your car in asphal or dirt.... or even air. The creativity of some people lets you do incredible and fun stunts.It will definitely bring a smile on your face. ",728,225,67,94,121,16,195

												For those of you who used to play it waaay back when, it's like TrackMania: Nations Forever.  Except it's better.TrackMania is widely known as being one of the most difficult racing games ever - to beat the different achievements (""medals"") on each track, you need to clock some seriously freaking amazing times.  And then there's the so-called ""Author Medal"" - the medal you can only achieve by beating the best time set by the track's creator.  I've played this game and TM:NF for years and I've only ever earned about three of them, at best.The visuals of this game are absolutely stunning, bringing the cars, tracks, and of course the stadium itself, truly to life.The amount of content in the game is virtually limitless, from user creations in the Workshop to tracks you can put together yourself.  The map creator gives you literally as much flexibility as the game's creators had, and is super easy to use.The multiplayer is a lot of fun too - connecting to servers and racing live with other players, or even having everyone individually clock their own best times, with a time limit to see who can clock the best time the fastest.  It's very easy to set up a server of your own too!And I also like the ""Official Time"" function - that's something they didn't have before in TM:NF.  It's solo-play, except that you can observe your best times and how they stack up to other players across your state, country, or across the globe.The music, as it was in TM:NF, isn't amazing (it's not bad, but not great either), but then again, it's the gameplay we're after, right?The only real gripe I had about the game is this: I noticed very quickly going through the White-level (easiest) tracks that a number of tracks were re-used from TM:NF, just adapted to the new graphics engine.  Really?  If I wanted to play those again, I would have just gotten the free download of Nations instead.But all-in-all, I recommend that you go for it, especially if you love racing and you love a challenge.  After all, it's only $10, and it comes with the free demo of ShootMania Elite.			",88,12,5,18,15,0,13

												Arrow keys. This is all you need to show your skill - no smokes, ults, tactics or anything like this. It's all on your precision and ability to adapt. The best part about TM2 is you can completely forget about whole that 'tryhardness' and just enjoy racing. It's really addictive! Multiple game modes makes this game even better, but there are not so many server to play them - most people stay at fullspeed or 'lol' maps. Nonetheless, I highly recommend this piece of competitive art - even if you're not 'i want to be the best in everything' type.			",65,10,2,16,5,2,5

My Favorite Racing gameI played loads of Trackmania Nations Forever when I was younger. Some of my best school memories where when we had a substitute in I.T and we all played Nations Forever over LAN. TrackMania² Stadium is exactly that, which new tracks, new leaderboards, better graphics, steam workshop with loads of car skins!It's the type of game everyone can play but your level of skill depends on your understanding of how best to approach a corner, a sudden turnor when to brake and drift to get a perfect line but still retain most of your speed. This kind of play makes it really competitive and as you chase the better times of the top players it can feel very rewarding when you get a great run or take a perfect corner. On the other hand it can also enduce copious amounts of rage when you love tap a wall and lose all your speed or clip a bump in the road and FLY OFF THE TRACK! WHO EVEN PUT THAT THERE.... good times >.> But seriously its a fantastic game and well worth the money9.8/10- Most competitive Racing game... ever. Only way it could be better was if it was Free like Nations Forever was ",588,106,24,58,52,6,99

												After almost 150 hours on this game, I think it's time to review.This game is about one thing: Racing against people. Okay, perhaps there's more to it than that. What drove me to play this game as much as I have is simply being able to see my ranking amongst others in the world/local rankings. I made it to rank 300 in the U.S. and in the top 500 in North America. While that's not a lot, there is a competetive sense that keeps me coming back to shave a few miliseconds off of my time.Pros: *Controller Support!*User generated maps.*Great community.*Fun and frustrating, yet strangely addicting.*Everyone has the same stats, no matter what car ""skin"" they have.Cons:*Dry times for servers.*There are people that are better than you.*""Planets"" as a currency system could use some work for the later game.*Lacks some individuality-per-player.Overall: 8/10 Pretty solid racing experience!

												At the time of this review I have only just started playing this game but I have played the free version of this game before. TrackMania Stadium is a racing game that anyone can play regardless of skill level and whether you're interested in racing games or not. This game just requires lots and lots of practice as all this game is about is just reactions and learning certain tracks. Different people from all over the globe play this game and their rank is given in respect to their location on the Globe eg. Europe, Oceana etc... This is a non contact racing game meaning that it's not about coming first across the line but more about your time, so what ever server you join will not have any lag which is quite cool actually. If all you care about is skill, reaction times, and all out fun then this is the game you NEED to get. I played the free versoin for quite a while and I must say that it's very, very addictive :) This game is unforgetable and is one of my favourites and I guarantee that it will be one of yours too.

												This game is AWESOME! Trackmania is like ""Trials"" (or Elastomania) with cars. If you like arcade racing games check the demo. Multiplayer is great - 100% fair play. All cars are the same and are ""ghosts"" so noone will push you from the track. There is only one thing that matters - your skills.   Maybe in Steam i have only one hour, but I've played: Trackania Nations (it's free), Trackmania Forever beta, Trackmania Forever polish beta (check if translation is OK) and Trackmania Forever (for review). 10/10			",318,105,44,19,29,2,29

												Trackmania 2 Stadium is an arcade-like racing game with loops, jumps, and ridiculously fast speeds. I picked it up  on a Steam sale for around $2.50 along with Trackmania Canyon for me and a friend because it was so cheap. There's a stripped down single player version: No story, no opponents (Except for the predeterminded time goasts), no collision. Just you and the road.The multiplayer is the real reason why you would buy this game, though. The basis of multiplayer is that you have at set amount of time to finish the track and get the fastest time possible, while others are doing the same. There's a ""place"" in that it's how you match up against other player's fastest times. It has an extensive server list, modding community, and track creators, and they're friendly!! Some actually say hello and strike a conversation when a new person joins. Because the game relies mostly on skill, professional racing teams have been created. I must say, server admins have a very good taste in music.On the visual side, it looks very good, and because it's a reletively light game, you'll be running a pretty high FPS most of the time. You can also design your own vehicle skins, either the default car, or something from the Steam community. The modding community can let you race around the track as Sonic if you want. The game itself can be pretty hard, to be honest. Many tracks require split second reaction time with very low margin for error. Don't be discouraged if you crash off the track a few times or if the pros get a faster time than you. Happens to the best of us. The more you play a track, the better you naturally get at it.Overall, try to get it on a Steam sale. You might like it. ",18,2,3,1,2,1,0

												It's basically a graphically overhauled Trackmania Nations. But to be honest, I wouldn't want it any other way. I always loved the handling of the car in Nations and I'm used to it. And the handling is exactly the same in Trackmania² Stadium which is a big factor for me. All the old maps and replays from Nations are compatible with Trackmania² Stadium, sadly the skins aren't, but that's not really a big deal to me.TL;DR: If you loved Trackmania Nations, I recommend this!

												If you want a game that's just fun driving - no story, no hassle, no traffic, no over-the-top system requirements, no playing for hours to get a decent car - just pure fun driving... buy this!...when it's on sale.If you really wanna try this but the price is a bit high (which is fair enough), look for Trackmania Nations Forever. It's essentially the older version of this, just free.This version has better graphics and stuff but honestly not a HUGE amount of new stuff.That being said, it is brilliant. It has a really great track editor and a nice community. The multiplayer is awesome - it's essentially time trials but with the other racers around you as ghosts. And the singleplayer is awesome for those who like shaving split seconds off your time to get the gold medal. You don't even feel alone in singleplayer, because there's ghost vehicles for each medal time.If you have spare money or this is on sale, buy this.If you don't, get Trackmania Nations Forever.

												Played Trackmania Sunrise and Trackmania Nations a few years ago so I decided to grab the latest iteration of the series as I spotted it on sale. The game engine is still great and I understand that the developers were reluctant to change too much from the mechanics that made the series great in the first place. The graphics have been slightly improved although not the level of AAA racing games, the gameplay and replayability makes up for the lack of polish and eye-candy found in other games.The only gripe that I have is the archaic menus and UI, although not difficult to navigate through by any means, they should overhaul the navigation for the main menu and server browsing, as it is, it looks pretty dated.Recommended for Trackmania fans, not recommended for those looking for more than just simple racing fun(crazy tracks, time attacks).

												A fast and exciting racing game.  Cheap yes, but worth more than it costs!  I was sick of racing games that have those invisible walls preventing you from exploring the world and making for a very unrealistic experience.  Trackmania doesn't have them!  Definitely fun and worth every penny.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Be warned its not a game for the racer who expect a career,simulation or progression system. There is one car and the whole concept is around trying to beat your opponent's time and not be first over the finish. With these limitations, the game is still a nailbiting experience. If you enjoy watching qualifying of F1 cars more than the race, then this game is for you. Add a solid workshop, great tracks to download and a strong community and you have a racing game that changes with every play through.			",145,29,31,25,42,3,28

												Trackmania is one of those games that if you need a ""quick fix"" this will provided it.  Very easy to pick up, this isn't a true race against each other, more of race against each other's time.  While you can see the other racers, you can run into them, or bump them, etc...  More of  a time trial game.  Also comes with a built in track editor to build your own courses which can be published to others.			",32,1,2,9,5,0,7

												Trackmania² Stadium is classed as a Racing game, but as I see it, it's more of a puzzle and strategy. With the single-player mode, you get a set amount of tracks split into five groups of skill level, White being the easiest and Black being the most difficult (a bit like the karate belt system) and within those tracks, there is no room (as I know) to download other tracks and play them alone in single-player.Multiplayer is a whole different story, however. As you get more used to a server and it's map rotation (if there is one) you'll be able to remember the tracks as you play them within the five to ten minute time limit per map, and shave off those precious few tenth's of a second, sometimes even making it come down to the hundreth's of a second, truly making your mark in the track's leaderboard. A bit like Formula 1 in that matter, as it really comes down to the skill of the driver, and the knowledge of the track that you're on.But don't let that deter you if you aren't into that track-precision stuff, as there as many other fun-orientated maps which don't focus as much on your time taken, albeit there are less people on those servers.Story = -/10 (no story)Multiplayer = 9/10 (amazing community, great maps in general, easy to get along with)Graphics = 8/10 (when maxed out, the game can and does look stunning)Graphics Perfomance = 9/10 (runs very smoothly on older pc's and laptops)Controls = 10/10 (personally, I play with a keyboard, but controllers are supported too, and again, how you drive your car really makes the difference)Total = 36/40Final Comments - Please, if you can, pick up Trackmania² Stadium when you can, or even Canyon or Valley. If you have to wait for a sale, then so be it, but if you can buy it at full price, then please support the developers behind the amazing game(s) that is Trackmania².			",72,12,12,12,21,2,5

												Excellent but the idea to split the community across three titles was not a good one. This also isn't an enormous evolution over the previous TM games, despite the ""2"" tacked onto it. There's some more online community stuff in the menus, but I'm not sure of the point of any of it and generally ignore it.If you're going to get any TM2, get Stadium, and probably ignore the other two. Stadium's parts tend to be more versatile and there are more community tracks. Stadium was originally a standalone free version of Trackmania United, and then when United Forever rolled around Stadium was the one environment you could play for free, so naturally it had more players and the community glommed onto it more. Nadeo also gave it a more diverse set of parts in Forever than the other environments, and it's been expanded on even further in this game.There is a demo and I'd highly recommend checking it out.
