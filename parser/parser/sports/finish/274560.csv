												Pretty much the only modern game even trying to replicate the execellence of Tyrian or Raptor. A recent patch (28 April 2015) addressed the early game slog by having the player start with a second weapon slot so there is at least a semblance of customization at the beginning.pros:-multiple weapons-actual hp bar so the game plays more like a shooter than a mouse avoider-online co-op multiplayercons:-waits way too long to actually unlock the 5 weapon slots and a good selection of weapons (it gets good, but still)-Tyrian is 10x better, if you haven't already played Tyrian so many times that you just can't play it any more go get it insteadVerdict:If you long for a Tyrian or Raptor styled game and have played out the old classics, get this.

												This game is a must for people who like shooters with an army-style. The style of the game is there are two types of targets: Ground and Air, which can give extra challenge if you're not careful with the situation. There is a shop to spend your scrap collected through the levels for weapons, levels to unlock perks and weapon slots, and even a versus mode. For those who want simplicity or simplicity with a little more on a shooter, this game should be in your collection.Pros:-You don't die in one hit. You have two things: Shield that regenerates and protects your health, and health.-Shop to buy new weapons and equip-Perks(buffs) that you get when you level up.Cons:-A bit tough at the beginning on killing enemies, but at least it walks you through on situations.

												Revolution Ace was an interesting attempt to build a shmup in the Unreal Engine, which was not at all designed for the purpose.  The resulting game isn't a disaster, but neither is it a compelling success.The appeal of shmup games typically comes from hectic action; your weapons are typically devastating, killing the weakest foes in one hit, and your fire rate is intense.  Challenge in a shmup typically comes not from any deficiency of your avatar, but the sheer numbers of enemies it sends at you, the intensity of their fire, and the speed at which they move.Revolution Ace departs radically from that standard shmup formula.  You and the majority of your foes move slowly, even sluggishly.  Your weapons are uncharacteristically weak, requiring a good second or so of concentrated fire to take down most normal opponents, who are comparatively few in number.  Instead of a hyperkinetic frenzy of ducking and weaving through enemy fire while opponents explode in dramatic fireballs all around you, Revolution Ace feels more like a slow, stubborn push through the enemy forces, hoping to make it through to the final boss before your armor is depleted.The addition of true 3D modeling, switchable air/ground fire and recharging shield to the genre are interesting, but don't really make up for the loss of the speed and destructiveness that is the hallmark of this style of gameplay.

												This is exactly the kind of game that I miss so much. A sidescrolling game just like ""Sonic Wing"". I used to play it every time I went to a gaming shop, with my stepfather. This is very nostalgic. It's challenging and has a retro style for sounds and music (and even kinda visual). There are bosses and different kind of enemies, weapons and upgrades.

 The RundownRevolution Ace is definitely NOT one of the best shooters in its genre. It has frame rate problems, the bullets blend in with the background, and generally it's a bit of a mess. But somehow when I was playing it, something made me look past all that and I really did have a good time. It has an upgrade system that definitely helps with the sense of progression, a fun but challenging boss at the end of each stage, and a neat system of air bullets vs ground bullets, forcing you to pick between whether you're shooting in the background or in the foreground. But by far the best part of the game is the multiplayer. It takes all the problems I mentioned and kinda blurs them out of your mind, because, at least for me, I was more focused on playing a game with my friend and the issues became less glaring. There's also a cool multiplayer versus mode, which I've never seen implimented into a top-down shooter before. It works pretty well.As a whole, Revolution Ace was like a fat guy sitting in front of you at a playoff game. It's annoying at first, sure, but if you can look past the problems, you have a great game in front of you. It's a fun experience, and you should definitely consider picking it up if you have some friends to play it with. Pros Upgrades system Interactive environments Interesting air vs ground mechanics Great multiplayerCons Frame rate issues Bullets tend to blend in with the background Lasts maybe a bit longer than it needs to ",168,45,3,18,11,1,13

Builds on the foundation of the old and classic with fresh novelty // Recommended for those of inventive mind and quick reflexes~Full Disclosure: This game was reviewed with a key given by the developers~+ Missed enemies that return for a second pass are highlighted, indicating a drop in value; this is a useful feature that encourages target prioritization, although this feature (strangely) seemed to make few appearances after the first level+ User interface, while not aesthetically sensational, is functional and unobtrusive+ A combination of unlockable perks, a straightforward leveling system, and myriad upgrade components available for purchase make for a refreshing level of customization+ Gameplay and ship customization does much to reward forward-planning and a tactical mind-set+ Boasts an attention to detail uncommon for the genre, such as ripple effects when firing into bodies of water, or trees being felled when strafed by machine gun fire+ Though few people seem to be taking advantage of it at the moment, the multiplayer is excellent; in particular, the 'Battle Chains' option is absolutely ingenious, and incredibly addicting (this mode lets the player run through a stage, then challenge a friend to the same stage, at which point their progress will be compared to yours and a return challenge issued, building to potentially better and better matches)+ The combination of air/ground combat is a breath of fresh air for the genre, and adds immensely to the challenge+ Agreeably lengthy campaign for an arcade shooter - not too long, not too short+ Healthy variety of enemy units that introduce new patterns and weaponry, building on top of those from previous stages, keeping the game fresh throughout+ Between ship modules and unlockable perks, the number of combinations at your disposal for tackling enemy units is staggering+ Visuals are par-for-the-course; they are a bit lacking by today's standards, but they are far from disappointing- There are occasional, and seemingly random drops in frame-rate (although they are, admittedly, very minor drops, and more casual players are unlikely to be offset by it)- Music, while not inherently terrible, suffers from a lack of variety; none of the scores really stand out, and they quickly fade into the background during gameplay (sound effects, also, were somewhat uninspired)- No aesthetic customization options; this wouldn't normally count against the game but, as there is otherwise an overwhelming emphasis on ship customization, this ended up standing out as a mild disappointment- While there is a plot, it's poorly presented, and it's clear that there was minimal effort put into it, whatsoever; there may as well have not been one includedLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit ",195,26,1,22,22,0,22

												An OK upstart of a game, but...1. Difficulty is all over the place. Even on easy it gets unenjoyable - fast.2. The game tries to be a lot like ""Raptor: The Call of Shadows"", a true classic. Tries, and fails miserably. You do get a shop for changing loadouts, you do get a smartypants shop owner, you do get a plane with shields, you do get the top-down scrolling... and not much else.3. Weapons are ridiculously underpowered, requiring a lot of stay-on-target time.4. The game still requires polishing, even without the balance issues. Music lags constantly in all the menus, sound design is mediocre at best, and it all requires an old version of nVidia PhysX just to run (builldings falling into pieces? planes dropping out of the sky? we could do without it at no gaming experience lost).All in all, a disappointment. Even if you see it at a bragain price somewhere, bear in mind that it might be not worth your time. Pick Jets'n'Guns instead if you really are a SHMUP fan.			",197,33,1,29,6,0,20

												Revolution Ace is a shoot 'em up game that takes inspiration from the classics.My favorite thing about it so far is the fact that there is room for customization, maybe not right at the beginning but with the inclusion of perks I'm free to make my jet fighter thing the way I want to! I get to play in my own unique way and so does every other player.  The UI and soundtrack are good for what they are and I didn't run into any flaws minor or major, and the levels are interesting enough to keep me playing, though not distracting me from the gameplay. The enemies all have something that is unique about them and all have different patterns, because of this the screen can become a cluster of enemies and bullets if you're not fast enough at clearing them out, so watch the shield regen.Speaking of shield, missed enemies do come back so sometimes if you missed an enemy or two you won't have the opportunity to regenerate your shield in an area that otherwise would've been clear, so if this happens you'll be left in a situation where you're being attacked without shields, which adds to the intensity to the gameplay.My only gripe with the game is that the bosses are too easy and too predictable, at least in the few first stages.I recommend this game and shout-outs to senpai studios for giving me a free key for this game.

												As a kid, I enjoyed playing games like Tiger Heli on the NES. This top-down, side scrolling gem brings us back to those days, but with a modern twist. Not only are the graphics decent for a 2D top-down, but you can collect scrap which is then used to purchase upgrades for your ship, making you a true Ace of the skies. Fight against entire air forces in campaign mode, play with friends in a co-op game, or choose skirmishes and dogfight it out with both air and ground targets, Revolution Ace also allows you to pit your skills against other players, in side-by-side, split screen fashion. A great buy at a relatively low price, with progressively difficult settings to give you a challenge, This is a pretty good gem I would recommend.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												So, I was gifted a copy of this from the developers publicist in exchange for a fair and honest review.I've put about an hour into it so far, which given the nature of the game seems like a reasonable amount of time to draw some conclusions. I will update this review if I reach different conclusions later.Anyway, this game seems fairly accessible at first. It is a pretty basic shmup that also later on features some lite bullet hell aspects. The actual movement of your ship is a little slow, and at first, your weapons arent very powerful either. However, as you gain credits via finishing missions and generally blowing stuff up, you can buy upgrades to your weaponry and shields that make this a bit more effective and a bit easier EXCEPT the games difficulty scales more quickly than you can upgrade, and so this actually becomes a pretty challenging game after the first couple missions. I'm level 7 right now and have wrapped up something like 8 or 10 missions so far. At this point, I'm dying pretty quickly even after my upgrades (which you can swap out between missions as well btw) and even though powerups are readily available. Still, I havent reached the point of frustration yet, as I feel the right combo of upgrades is really all it takes to get past the levels despite the fact that they seem scaled beyond your present capabilities as you progress.As you level up, you also occasionally earn perks, which are basically permanent upgrades to your ship. There is actually a wide variety to choose from, so you will need to choose wisely here. The graphics are pretty much on par with what you expect. They arent mind blowing, but they do look nice and fairly well represent the genre and the era the game hearkens back to. Speaking of....the music is also well in line with this. It gets a bit repetitive but still remains listenable throughout.All told, I would normally give this about a 5.5 out of 10. However, the game is presently featured for under 30 cents, and it has trading cards as well, the value of which pretty much are equal to the cost of the game. So...despite the 5.5 out of 10, it's still pretty much a must own if you make use of the marketplace...and lets be real...for 30 cents or so, you will end up owning this at some point anyway.

												Revolution Ace is a top down Shmup in where you fight enemies from both the air and the ground simultaneously. There are two keys that fires your weapons. One is to aim your projectiles in front of you and the other to fire at the ground below you. It can be confusing to tell on what plane an enemy is on and I would often times find myself shooting over an enemy. After a bit of practice and knowledge of the enemy it becomes a non-issue. Before getting to the gameplay you may want to tweak around with the graphic settings but be warned, turning on CSAA anti-aliasing will immediately crash the game for some reason. There are four modes in this title. Campaign provides a story and unlocks more levels for the other modes, Skirmish is to replay any mission you want and even some exclusive ones and versus has you and another player going through the same mission competing for score while introducing some new power-ups that hinders your opponent.The last mode is called BattleChain that works similarly to versus though you play alone and later send the ghost data of your playthrough to the person you challenge. Campaign mode is where you'll want to start as it does it's best to introduce you to the mechanics of this game. The story of Revolution Ace has an interesting beginning in which the nations of the world built machines to fight their wars instead of wasting any human lives and the robots eventually stop fighting each other to launch a devastating attack against humanity. It has a very interesting premise but goes nowhere as they went for the “funny redneck” vaguely explains what you are doing on each mission route. No one expects a story from a Shmup though it did feel rather disappointing to start off with one and promptly forget about it. Throughout every mission you will be facing a horde of hostile robots in your cheap cobbled together jet in a last ditch attempt to retaliate against the enemy. It starts off as a suicide mission though after many successes you start gathering scrap that allows you to build much better equipment on your craft.The more enemies you destroy the more scrap you collect once successfully completing a mission. You get much more scrap if you kill an enemy before it leaves the screen. If it leaves and comes back for a second barrage it will be worth far less. Scrap will be the most important thing in this game since Revolution Ace features RPG like progression in where newer unlocked weapons you can buy in the armory are better in every way compared to your meager starting equipment. You also level up by gaining experience and unlike scraps you still get experience even if you fail the mission. Leveling up sometimes means that you get to choose from one of many perks that increase damage for a certain weapon type, allows your shields to recharge faster and one that increases your overall health to name a few. Sometimes instead of being able to choose from perks while leveling up you will instead have new equipment available to buy in the Armory. You will be needing all the help you can get as this game is brutal and I barely managed to beat it even while playing through the entire game with someone else.This would be a good time to mention the online multiplayer. It is great and I couldn't notice any lag or hiccups during 6 or so hours of playtime on two very poor internet connections. I wish more shumps would include online play as most have the option for two players but many of us can't take advantage of it. Funny that a 2 dollar game should include it and it's a feature I must applaud. This is one of the most graphically impressive shmups on the market as it runs on Unreal Engine 3 and features cool effects such as the water rippling when shot at as well as fancy explosions. It is a very nice looking game but there is nothing interesting to look at as most of the game is either in a bland desert, the sky or over water. Enemy designs are decent though this is where the game suffers the most due to the RPG system of this game. From start to finish the enemies felt very bullet spongy making the combat feel unsatisfying and utterly devoid of any flow as you spend way too much time on a single enemy while there are dozens more coming for you.That makes it feel like a game designed around grinding instead of skill. It is possible to beat the game without any grinding, however bullet spongy enemies make it tedious task. Leveling up also unlocks weapon slots for your ship allowing you to place a few more guns on the side of it to shoot horizontally. You unlock the left weapon slot first and it takes quite a while to unlock the one on the right side making it feel like very artificial progression. We are the last hope to destroy the robot menace and the mechanic won't install another gun on your preferred side of the ship because we are not level 18? The RPG features of this game aren't subjectively bad as those that like the feeling of becoming more powerful and being able to take on more difficult tasks are sure to enjoy it but for those of us that prefer Shmups to have everything we need to stand a chance from the get go and skill being the determining factor in whether we are victorious or a pile of debris on the floor.Weapons variants range from bullets, lasers and explosives. Each unlocked weapon has different effects even if they are the same variant so make sure to carefully read the description as some weapons can't be shoot at ground enemies. Fighting ground enemies is kind of clunky as you have some type of auto lock feature while shooting at the ground so you may fire at the wrong target from time to time. It is very cool seeing a buggy riding around down in a desert shooting up at you and those add some strategy to game as you decide whether to fight the enemies in front of you or the ones below you. The projectiles on screen are shot by the dozens and is near bullet hell levels of crazy. Unlike Bullet Hells your ship's hitbox is pretty huge here and you can take quite a bit of punishment before meeting your demise. You have both a shield and hull health to protect you from exploding. It doesn't matter much if the shield takes damage as not firing your weapons will recharge its energy back, hull health on the other hand you do not want to take any damage to . The only way to heal hull health is via a semi-rare powerup that enemies drop and if your shields are completely down that means things have gone really wrong.Shields can also be bought and replaced with different types such as ones that take more damage but recharge slower. The whole not shooting to recharge your shields gimmick is rather weird and will more often than not cause you to get overwhelmed as more enemies enter the fray. It makes for some rather intense moments where you have a split second to decide if you stop firing and try to hold out until some of your shield is recharged or to hold your ground and risk it all. These moments would be a lot more fun if the enemies weren't so bullet spongy and you could go out in a blaze of glory though there is no denying it will still have you on the edge of your seat. One complaint I have regarding projectiles is that some enemies shoot dark brown projectiles that are really hard to see in most cases. There is also this weird gimmick in where your ship randomly rises higher to the sky or lower in certain set points of the level. Bosses are giant enemies be they fortresses or battleships that will do everything it can to shoot you down. It is rather cool seeing them get desperate as their health is low and launching an all-out barrage of projectiles. In the end of the day this is a content packed shmup with online coop, some levels in Skrimish mode that randomly generate the game and many handmade missions to blast your way through. It is by no means a game that will take the world by storm but for its low price this is a game that any fan of the Shmups should at least take a look at.			",1881,553,61,204,168,17,226

												A truly fantastic nostalgia trip back to the world of jet fighter games.Had a brill run through on this game, got to Campaign +2 in about 10 hours, then went ahead and started challenging people. If anyone has played the SNES game Super Strike Gunner, then this game is for you, it feels exactly the same as SSG did when I played it all those years ago.There are some very nice ideas in this game, the verses and battle modes where you can compete against players are very fun indeed, along with the customizing of your aircraft, perk system, leveling system and NG+, it does give the game some replay-ability, although when you reach later levels (20+), I found the game just turned into level-grinding to get those extra perk levels. There are some arguably minor bad points I got from this however, the main one being how short the game actually is. While I personally don't mind a nice casual game to pass the time, a little more content and a more challenging difficulty would have helped a bit, (you can easily go straight to the highest difficulty setting and ace the game).Another point I would like to mention is how easy the achievements are to get, while some may see this as a good thing, some hunters might not enjoy the lack of challenge in acquiring the full set of achievements, again though I think this is more about personal preference than anything.Overall I was very happy with the game, even at full price I would have still bought this when it came under my radar, so 96% off was a total bargain for me. Putting the minor issues aside, I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a nice casual game of this genre without a doubt, especially if you enjoyed SSG and the like all those years ago.In conclusion, my personal rating for Revolution Ace is :8.5/10 ",369,84,12,51,35,2,58

												Later on, mankind uses AI driven machines to wage war, yet this invert releases when the machines turn on their masters. To fight this risk, your top of the line pilot takes to the sky in an old travel to counter. The machines are summoning the land, sea and air so your battle won't be straightforward. At first I felt that Change Expert didn't much issue with a story as the elucidation for why you are controlling an old stream against bleeding edge foes is simply revealed several levels into the beguilement. It doesn't have any kind of effect nonetheless, as no reason is relied upon to partake in some old school, level shooting movement. Disregarding the Shocking Engine controlled visuals, Change Master seems like it was detached straight from a nineties arcade machine. Unmistakably time has been spent on making the ground look fascinating with effects like trees affecting in the wind and mountains that climb up into the screen however the general effect is somewhat frustrating. It could just be my own slants, however the sensible style visuals essentially look a touch too much troubling for an over the top style entertainment like Bombshell Expert. I can't accuse the contrasting qualities in any case, as the delight takes you transversely over unsettled areas, mountains and oceans, with a couple levels shrouded in haze or solicited in snow. There are irrefutably minutes where the diversion benefits look and there is emphatically no nonattendance of enemies to shoot at, yet there is nothing that really isolates the visuals from the pack. Change Master is a genuinely coordinate shooter, yet there are a few novel things that make it worth a minute look. Firstly, enemies attack from both the air and ground and you use two separate fire gets to attract them. Weaving through shots while shooting on the right plane can be questionable at in any case, yet it soon ends up being second nature. Completing levels compensate you with experience centers and shrapnel. Experience centers are tallied up to fabricate the level of your fly, which prompts to prizes, for instance, more weapon spaces, new weapons and a liven of your choice. The preferences keep running from better covering to speedier slugs or strong laser and there are lacking levels to pick each one of them so you have to pick carefully. The shrapnel is your cash and is used to purchase the programmed rifles, rockets and bar firearms and moreover shields and exceptional strikes that make your specialty so significant. There are more than 20 weapons to peruse and the position on your fly matters which makes it diverting to mix and match to see what the results are. The campaign mode felt to some degree longer than what you generally find in the class and upon fulfillment you can start a harder, New+ playthrough. There are similarly three inconvenience settings to give everyone a sensible shot at beating the entertainment. Enemies attack in substantial numbers and on Run of the mill or higher, the ones that you miss returns for another go, however the way that you have a shield and protective layer meter makes things stunningly less requesting. Shooters with one hit executes can perplex, so Uprising Master is a conventional introduction to the class that won't drive off newcomers. If you understand blazed on the fight mode or feel like you need some extra experience and shrapnel you can explore different avenues regarding the Engagement mode. In Struggle you find the opportunity to pick a level from any of the ones that you have viably opened to practice or farm experience and shrapnel. Fundamentally more fun is the Versus mode where you play one beside the other with another player and can mess up their entertainment by sending enemies to their side of the screen. The Battle Chains mode works the same as Versus however rather than playing against some individual dynamically you challenge their recordings. If you complete the test you can send it back to the principal player who then need to fight with all the extra tumult that you brought on in the midst of your playthrough. The test increment quickly and this mode can end up being exceptionally addictive, however finding diverse players is not that basic right at this point. I had a lot of fun with Change Master however this may be a result of me playing shooters since the start of the arcades. More up and coming players might be less thoughtful about the dull visuals and rather non particular sound. The controls regardless, are responsive and the preoccupation most likely packs a test, however isolated from the versus modes it doesn't by and large rise up out of the pack. I really favored the thought so in a perfect world LGG can make a turn off, which genuinely increment the era values.

												Decent Shooter game.The pace is moderate playable unlike many shooters that leaves you little to nil breathing room.The Battle Chain system is quite interesting where out of no where, you find yourself in a challenge with someone back and fro vying for score to overtake.Upon exceeding level 16, the game would get more fluid and enjoyable with the elite weaponaries.Occassionally freezes my screen and crash out of the game especially in Battlechain mode tho.But overall it works fine.Had more fun in this than the others in the Hyperspace Pack.

												Pretty much the only modern game even trying to replicate the execellence of Tyrian or Raptor. A recent patch (28 April 2015) addressed the early game slog by having the player start with a second weapon slot so there is at least a semblance of customization at the beginning.pros:-multiple weapons-actual hp bar so the game plays more like a shooter than a mouse avoider-online co-op multiplayercons:-waits way too long to actually unlock the 5 weapon slots and a good selection of weapons (it gets good, but still)-Tyrian is 10x better, if you haven't already played Tyrian so many times that you just can't play it any more go get it insteadVerdict:If you long for a Tyrian or Raptor styled game and have played out the old classics, get this.

												This game is just.... awesome!Bear with me now and let me explain. First of all the trailers on the store page dont do justice to the game at all. I bought this one by just looking at price. Turns out it's as good or in some areas even better than Jets'n'Guns which is my favorite shooter. Did not expect this at all from such a simple looking shooter. A bit about the mechanics: game has a leveling system and scrap (money) you get from doing missions, multiplayer battle challenges etc. With these goodies you buy new gear and in the spirit of Jets'n'Guns it is pretty much mandatory to test things out and find the best setups. Skirmish missions can be done if you wish to grind for some extra scrap. Configurations do matter as the Campaign start becoming harder bit by bit but the real test are the awesome battle chains where you or someone lays out a challenge to others in form of a level completion replay. Others will try to beat your score and you will see in a replay how they did it. Fun starts when someone rips the score so high you really have to think how will i beat this. You might need to re-think your setup to beat the score. (Your opponent see how many times you tried to beat his score so dont humiliate yourself too much by trying a strategy that just doesnt work)  Eventually the score will climb very high as the same challenge is bounced back and forth until either side just gives up.  Multiplayer system is very good - though be warned that it is quite confusing to use at first.  Check forums.Game also sports a interesting notification system where you get a message to your steam notifications bar that someone has beaten your score and it's your turn to try to beat the opponents score. In order to not just praise the game there is a bit of criticism too: Lack of feedback everywhere is annoying. menus are unresponsive for some time too yet not greyed out. In missions hitting targets does not yield much of reaction. i'd also like to see a bit more animation frames on certain enemies for a more flowing visual game experience. And just what are those really tiny white walkers that fire missiles at you? No big things but give a rough feeling to the game.			",775,311,45,87,97,7,148

												This game is a very nice shoot'em up ! It's easy to pick up, and yet hard to master, but very enjoyable if you like old-school shoot'em up.The difficulty is fairly balanced, and you can improve your weapons (by buying some more at the armory) so you can keep up with the waves of ennemies coming at you !If you're skilled enough you can finish the campaign quickly, but then you can try the skirmish mode or increase the difficulty to find more challenge.All in all, it's very fun if you've got a few minutes to spare, or an hour to grind.You can also try a well-thought multiplayer that allows you to send challenges to people around the world, and they can try to beat your score.Pros +- Easy to pick-up- Interesting concept of both ennemies on the ground and in air- Old school- Customization of your arsenal- Several tactics and playstyles depending on what wepaons and perks you choose- Interesting delayed multiplayer challenges- Controller support- Skill-based- CheapCons -- Old school- Graphics (not bad, but not so appealing)- Repetitive			",243,26,1,20,20,0,27

												+ Retro, top down, arcade shooter+ Mouse or keyboard gives you differing play style+ Good weapon selection, actively makes you feel more powerful+ Sound is decent with explosions and gunfire+ You get rewards for partial level completion+ Multiplayer options+ Devs are addressing issues and making improvements~ Enemies use the same attack patterns~ Graphics are somewhat low-fi~ Some bullet hell mixed in- Sudden ramps in difficulty- Random mouse lag in the menu screenFull disclosure, was given a key to review the game. While top-downs were never my fave genre I'd sling a  few quid into an arcade at the local chippy while waiting for my order and this game takes me right back. The retro graphics could use a polish but then it does capture the feel of arcades of the 2000's well. The mechanics and weapons are fun to try and every time you fly you progress.Conclusion: 7/10. As a work in progress it's worth a budget price.			",683,272,20,84,61,7,96

												January 12, 2017This is a basic Shoot 'Em Up, I played through the entire campaign in Co-op with a friend. We also did a couple of random missions for more cash and xp to upgrade our ships. We bought this game on sale for CDN$ 0.25.THE GOOD:-The weapons are pretty diverse and all work differently, from homing rockets to sweeping beams.-The perks system allows you to customize ur ship even more, with bonus damage to bullet guns and stuff like regenerating shield on plasma weapon kills.-I didnt have any performance issues.-The enemies had a lot of variety.-Both ground and air targets make for a more interesting gameplay.-Easy co-op joining with the steam friend list.THE UGLY:-The random missions are... random. From bosses spawning off screen to insanely hard levels.-Not enough unique bosses and most of them just dont move and throw bunch of♥♥♥♥♥♥at you with turrets.-After each campaign mission the 2nd player has to manually rejoin the lobby of the host.-The game has a ""Game Launcher"" that serves no purpose at all.-No color customization can make it hard to recognize which ship you are.TLDR: We had fun with our time with this little game, it was fun for a 25 cent game.Considering the price: 7/10			",327,74,7,49,33,4,68

												A fresh modern american styled shmup with online co-op. Online Co-op! More shmups need to be on steam and they also need to have online co-op.Very good upgrades and weapons customization. Your ship has slots in which you can stick weapons wherever you want. Look at the community hub for screenshots of the shop. You can place weapons on the wings to shoot sideways. You have ""scrap"" (money for shop), experience points for leveling up your rank (which opens more weapon slots), and perks.The levels move slow and it may seem like a walk in the park towards the beginning, but don't let that fool you since you can find yourself easily overwhelmed all of a sudden. It's not a ""bullet hell game"" since there aren't 1000 bullets on the screen, but that doesn't mean you won't run into a bullet infested screen. This is definitely apparent in the later levels. The level of challenge is perfect with this one. It's not too easy and it's not too hard to make you stop playing altogether.Besides it having campaign co-op, you can split-screen battle a friend to see who ends up with the higher score. There are a few power-ups specific that appear in this mode which will affect the other player. It can either be positive or negative so that you don't just grab every one you see.You have one life to beat a level, but you have two lifebars. One of them recharges when you stop shooting and once the other one is depleted, you die. Very neat feature.Bottom line: If you're into shumps, this one needs to be in your library.

Product received for free
												In the future, humanity uses AI driven machines to wage war, but this backfires when the machines turn on their masters. To combat this threat, your elite pilot takes to the sky in an old jet to retaliate. The machines are dominating the land, sea and air so your battle will not be easy.At first I thought that Revolution Ace didn’t even bother with a story as the explanation for why you are piloting an old jet against futuristic foes is only revealed a few levels into the game. It doesn’t matter though, as no excuse is needed to engage in some old school, horizontal shooting action. Despite the Unreal Engine powered visuals, Revolution Ace looks like it was ripped straight out of a nineties arcade machine. It is clear that time has been spent on making the ground look interesting with effects like trees swaying in the wind and mountains that rise up into the screen but the overall effect is a bit underwhelming. It could just be my personal preferences, but the realistic style visuals just look a tad too drab for an over the top style game like Revolution Ace.I can’t fault the diversity though, as the game takes you across jungles, mountains and oceans, with some levels shrouded in mist or covered in snow. There are definitely moments where the game does look good and there is certainly no lack of enemies to shoot at, but there is nothing that really sets the visuals apart from the pack.Revolution Ace is a pretty straightforward shooter, but there are a couple of unique things that make it worth a second look. Firstly, enemies attack from both the air and ground and you use two separate fire buttons to engage them. Weaving through bullets while shooting on the correct plane can be tricky at first, but it soon becomes second nature. Completing levels reward you with experience points and shrapnel. Experience points are tallied up to increase the level of your jet, which leads to rewards such as more weapon slots, new weapons and a perk of your choice. The perks range from better armor to faster bullets or strong laser and there are not enough levels to choose all of them so you have to pick carefully. The shrapnel is your currency and is used to purchase the machine guns, missiles and beam cannons as well as shields and special attacks that make your craft so formidable. There are more than 20 weapons to choose from and the placement on your jet matters which makes it fun to mix and match to see what the results are.The campaign mode felt a bit longer than what you usually find in the genre and upon completion you can start a tougher, New+ playthrough. There are also three difficulty settings to give everyone a fair chance at beating the game. Enemies attack in droves and on Normal or higher, the ones that you miss comes back for another go, but the fact that you have a shield and armor meter makes things considerably easier. Shooters with one hit kills can be frustrating, so Revolution Ace is a nice introduction to the genre that won’t scare away newcomers.If you tire of the campaign mode or feel like you need some extra experience and shrapnel you can try out the Skirmish mode. In Skirmish you get to pick a level from any of the ones that you have already unlocked to practice or farm experience and shrapnel. Much more fun is the Versus mode where you play side by side with another player and can mess up their game by sending enemies to their side of the screen. The Battle Chains mode works the same as Versus but instead of playing against someone in real-time you challenge their recordings. If you complete the challenge you can send it back to the original player who then have to contend with all the added mayhem that you caused during your playthrough. The challenge ramps up quickly and this mode can become quite addictive, but finding other players is not that easy at the moment.I had a lot of fun with Revolution Ace but this may be due to me playing shooters since the early days of the arcades. Newer players might be less forgiving about the bland visuals and rather generic audio. The controls however, are responsive and the game certainly packs a challenge, but apart from the versus modes it doesn’t really stand out from the pack. I really liked the concept so hopefully LGG can create a sequel, which really ramps up the production values.			",217,62,8,24,14,3,18

Thanks to my good friend, LockeProposal of the highly insightful Curator Page named LockeProposal’s Big Day Out, I was able to take a look into this-aptly labeled-bullet hell title. At first glance, Revolution Ace is simplistic yet charming, with simple graphics and exciting gameplay even on the lowest of difficulties. After completing the first level, however, I knew I was in for a wild ride similar to that of Tyrian (as you will see this title being compared to all over the internet, and for good reason.) I do have a few offline hours in this game, so please do not be evaded by my lack of logged time.Here are some things that really caught my eye when starting up and throughout:Graphics - I’m not really a stickler when it comes to graphics, so some of the simpler textures in this game didn’t bother me; I actually enjoyed how the game presents itself, as it is pretty much all you would need from a game of this caliber. Besides, why bump everything into the graphics when the only thing you will be looking out for is enemy fire? All joking aside, the graphics in this title actually surprised me, looking into how the defeated enemies scar the landscape and at the intriguing water physics. I understand some individuals are only interested in games that present themselves with AAA graphics, but that mindset should really be looked past with this title.Controls - From the beginning, you are presented with two modes of fire: air-vs-air and air-vs-ground. These two modes of fire can be accessed separately by clicking LMB or RMB, respectively, but can be remapped if needed. Movement remains standard in Revolution Ace, with your classic WASD keys or Arrow keys representing the various direction. I know I cannot speak for everyone with this, but the craft in this title controls quite nicely as dodging enemy fire while utilizing quick reflexes becomes more important as you progress. You will learn what MMB is used for later. I don’t want to spoil the fun.Gameplay - There’s a reason it’s called bullet hell. Revolution Ace is a side-scrolling (for lack of better terms) shooter with the objective of scoring enough points to ultimately better your ship and-subsequently-bring more pain to the bombarding enemy forces. As stated previously, the ship controls nicely from my perspective and the gunplay is fantastic. What I found of particular interest (described in the next segment) was the customization, which allows you to upgrade specific components of your ship to fit the scheme of play you want. For instance, do you want to stick to the classic missiles and guns on your ship and use the basic shield? or would you prefer utilizing an automated laser turret mounted on your craft with a chain-gun mounted on front and heat-seeking missiles primarily for enemy aircrafts?Upgrade/Customization System - Here’s where the game really shines. Remember the mention of only starting with a basic gun, missiles, and shield? As you progress through the campaign, both Experience and Scrap Points-which acts as a currency-are gained. Starting at an early level, ship upgrades-such as improving damage by 10% as your ship drops below 25% hull-can be chosen to better customize your level of play; be warned that once you select a ‘Perk’ you cannot reselect, though you gain more as you progress. Along with these permanent upgrades, you also unlock Slots on your ship, which allow for even more guns and other attachments-such as the aforementioned automated laser turret. From where I am in the game, this system of upgrades and customization has really impressed me, as I have been intrigued enough to switch my style of play so that I can buy different weapons. What also sets this system apart from others is that each gun, though different, is necessarily better than another so it really just depends on how you use each one. Did I mention there are things known as Super Weapons that can be used when clicking MMB and are cooldown based? Those are also really fun.TL:DR - There may be things I left out, but I have not been able to play the various game modes as of recent, which-by concept-are very intriguing. Though I did not mention it in the base review, I did enjoy the fact that there are no Achievements in the game pertaining to beating the Campaign at multiple difficulty settings, which allows the player to go at their own pace. At this stage, I’d highly recommend Revolution Ace for its fast-paced, over-the-top gameplay. Just remember: you will get hit. A lot. Thanks for reading.Do you enjoy these reviews? Please visit my Curator Page at  Spearpoint Reviews	.			",223,50,2,28,18,2,28

			My review of ""Revolution Ace"", an arcade jet fighter game developed and published by Laser Guided Games. ------------------------------- Like on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/EnjoyTheGaming...		

Game: Revolution AceGenre: Arcade Jet FighterDeveloper: Laser Guided Games Publisher: Laser Guided Games Copy supplied by developerRevolution Ace is an arcade jet fighter game developed and published by Laser Guided Games.GRAPHICSThe game, developed with Unreal Engine 3, looks just fine: there is a good amount of particle effects, enemy variety and high-quality textures, but, as with many of these games, the background gets really repetitive really fast. Still, the performance is quite good, with solid 60fps even with multiple explosions on the screen.GAMEPLAYYou control a customizable ship, and your objective is to get to the end of each map and defeat the boss. There are two types of attack: one to destroy flying vehicles and bombs, the other to destroy land vehicles and enemy bases. You can also acquire powerups and new weapons (as well as ship upgrades)through the shop using the money and XP that you gain at the end of each level.If you like this genre, you will love this game: it is formulaic but fun. If you never liked this type of games when they were popular in the arcades, I find it hard that you will enjoy it now.CHALLENGEThe game is very challenging on every difficulty setting, and it can get really frustrating the more you play it: sometimes dodging enemy fire seems impossible, and some of the boss fights will require more luck than actual skills.SOUNDThe sound effects are very good and each weapon and ship has its unique sounds. The soundtrack fits the game and, while it is forgettable, it does give you enough strength to keep going.REPLAYABILITYEven though there is small amount of Steam achievements (only 19), multiple difficulty settings, online leaderboards, local and online multiplayer will keep you coming back to this game more than once.While it lacks in a story and the gameplay is very formulaic, there is much to enjoy in this game and you will spend mutliple hours trying to improve your ship and get higher scores. I highly recommend this game to fans of the genre and to those looking for a challenge. If you are new to the genre, I recommend waiting for it to go on sale.Story: n/aGraphics: 7Gameplay: 8Challenge: 9Sound: 7.5Replayability: 8ENJOYMENT: 7.5FRUSTRATION: 7Follow me on Twitter: @nickygra97Subscribe to my channelLike on Facebook{LINK REMOVED}Check my official websiteJoin my Steam group ",532,126,11,40,24,4,34

												Yes! Yes! Yes! :)This game is really fun and addictive! Never expected it to be that nice, especially for the price paid (compared to other games that were priced this low). You can play either in single-player mode, or in multi-player. And the latter mode is so great, you can compete with other players and try to get your score higher and higher every time :) Sometimes there's literally a hell on your screen, but it's fun to survive that :) The game gets updates and is very well designed, so it gives you hours of gameplay unlike some more expensive titles.Definitely recommended!

												The general idea and systems are great. The scrap system with unlocking weapons slots is works well. The regularly upgrading item shop will keep you changing out and trying new equipment each level. The sheild system is one of the best Ive seen in this type of game. It also sports a cool perk system which allows you to further customize the experience. While the technical and paper design is fairly strong, where the game falls short is the execution. The UI is challenging and you will more than likely accidentaly purchase a weapon twice or salvage something you want before fully understanding  the shop/equip menu. The art is quite bad overall with uninspiring visual designs in enemies, VFX and environment. There are a few really good boss encounters and some of the enemy patterns keep the gameplay feeling somewhat unique throughout.  The majority of the regular enemies and the bulk of levels are fairly bland and the pacing feels flat. There are very few highs and lows which makes the game start to feel boring too quickly.  Ground enemies shoot up at you and its very unclear when you will get hit so it can feel cheap at certain points. Overall: Good design + Mediocre gameplay execution + Bellow par visuals.  I will give this a very soft thumbs up, but I only reccomend this game to hardcore vertical shooter fans that have a lot of free time on their hands.			",796,214,20,87,46,3,99

												Great game.The graphics is simple, typical side-scrolling shooting game. But there're some good points here,1. It's not that flashy and crowded (e.g. too much lighting, flashing bomb, etc.). I personally like this.2. I dont know about many other game like this nowadays, but in this game, when a ground unit shoot the missile,artillery, bomb, it actually getting bigger when it's closing in, not like some games who have ground+air units, yet the projectile still looks the same no matter they shoot from different angle/height/distance.Gameplay,1. Leveling system. Few games of this genre have this system, and with this, we can get the perks system and open some weapons slot2. The perks system (some call it mastery, passive, etc.) works well in this game.3. Customized arsenal (YES, I LIKE IT A LOT). Remember in some games like this, when you accidentally took 1 single weapon powerup, and your current maximum level weapon got replaced by lvl 1 new weapon? We dont have it in this game. We set the weapon right from the start at the armory. We can choose what we want in our plane, and we have 6 (AFAIK, could be more) weapon slots.Finally, the support from the developerTHEY ARE AMAZING!!!The response is quick,and the explanation is simple (the solution worked immediately).

												This game isn't the prettiest of 'em all. In fact it's more like ""Brienne of Tarth"" of shoot 'em ups. But if you can look past the poor visuals - some qualities await you. The qualities being:Solid, fast paced gameplay.Great progression system, including ship upgrades, leveling up and some sort of skill tree (being depicted as a simple list, though).Surprising and interesting visual effects that get the job done pretty well, despite being of mediocre quality.All in all, a fun shmup worth playing. It's now for €0.19 which is hilarious. I'm not sure I'd be completely happy if I got it at full price, but any reasonable discount should justify the purchase.			",136,23,4,15,5,0,11

												This is very interesting game which for some weird reason looks horrible on the store screenshots. Actually it has nice graphics with recognizable enemies and enviromental effects(like water ripples. It looks especially fun after nuclear strike. Yeah, this kind of game takes attention to detail) which makes experience organic and skill-based without some weird unexpectancies ruining the ride. Bosses are kinda fun: those are simple enough in terms of mechanic, but as I said - no unexpectancies: new enemies require adaptation, but learning ways to counter them is fun enough. Levels show interesting ways of indicating change of pace - zooming in or changing direction of flight. Leveling system is grindy sometimes but it provides good boost in case of hard level as loosing it makes XP accumulate regardless.It is also notable this game has enormous amount of additional gameplay capabilities: versus mode and stuff which should make it really good investment for prolonged amount of fun. Especially, considering current price.			",136,47,1,19,50,0,21

												It's 19 cents.It's an old school shooter with purchased upgrades. (in game purchases, not micro-transactions)It's fairly difficult, but not stupid hard.Nice graphics.I'd reccomend it, but I really wish someone could make a decent modern SHMUP that ""feels"" like the old school games as far as the intensity of action and level design.It's still a nice little shoot 'em up that will give you a little bit of Raiden or DonPachi style action.Edit: After spending more time with this game and beating the campaign, I can say it's a definite reccomend!There is a lot of extra stuff tossed in, like randomly generated skirmishes, a level up and perk system, and tons of weapons to try out and equip.

Revolution Ace is a really well done throwback to shoot-em-ups from the good old days of gaming, clearly inspired by games like the Raptor and 1940 series. It has everything that you could want in a modernized aircraft shooter, all of the aspects you know and love from back in the day with hints of more modern features such as customizable weapons, upgrades, a perks system and some cool multiplayer and challenger features brought to you by the ""Battle Chains"" mode. The lengthy singleplayer campaign is also a very welcome addition. Graphically, Revolution Ace isn't anything ground-breaking, but it's still pleasant to look at and is sufficient for the gameplay it re-introduces. The game is only really flawed by what feels like some overall polish and optimization issues here and there, FPS drops tend to happen somewhat often during later levels in the campaign, this can be helped by lowering the graphical options in the settings menu (though it shouldn't be necessary as my machine is capable of running games like Portal 2 with maxed out graphical settings). The user interface isn't fantastic either, it feels somewhat rushed and amateurish compared to the game itself, but the gameplay more or less makes up for some small graphical issues.Overall, this is a game I would happily recommend to anybody who enjoys some casual Shoot-Em-Up action. It's not a groundbreaking game, but it succeeds at what it sets out to do. Revolution Ace is worth it's price and is guaranteed to keep you entertained for hours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Disclaimer: I was given a Steam key for this game and did not pay for it.I don't really play bullet-hell or top-down shooters very often, but this one has been fun so far. The progression of upgrades and weapons is nicely paced, and there's enough variety to keep things interesting (new weapons/armor, perks, leveling up, etc). Boss battles are challenging but fair, even on easy difficulties. My only real complaint is that there's a very, very tiny delay (think mouse smoothing or something like that) between moving the mouse and the ship moving on screen. This looks to be a feature, but it took me some getting used to. Other than that, the controls are intuitive and responsive. Every time I died it was earned.The graphics are much nicer than the screenshots make them out to be. The music and sound effects fit in nicely with the action and don't become annoying at any point that I've reached yet. I haven't made it very far into the game, but I'm interested to see what else it has to offer. The price is right on point for something like this.If you like bullet-hell or top-down scrolly-shooters, then pick this one up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Cool take on a bullet hell shooter. But the lack of in game temporary picks ups makes the usually visceral experience provided by the genre absent.  Levelling up and being able to customise are good additions though. Having two seperate fire buttons for ground and sky enemies would have surely looked better on paper than it feels in game. Would prefer all guns blazing and coming into contact with the first enemy they hit vertically on the screen. As someone who accidentally flips through text based tutorials I did not figure out that there were ground and sky buttons until around the 3 or 4th game. Fire originating from ground enemies is hard to judge as it is in a 3d space when the view is 2.5d or potentially isometric.Well worth a look if you are into the genre but it is kind of a mixed bag.

												This is an inept Raptor: Call of the Shadows clone released 20 years after the fact. I could deal with the flash game graphics (static objects that pan and rotate whee) and Fischer Price: My First Soundtrack if the gameplay wasn't so hopeless. Popcorn enemies are bullet sponges, your weapons are varied but mostly feel impotent, and your gigantic hitbox extends generously past the visual border of your plane. Still, it's largely challengeless because the cheap hits are offset by a huge health bar and recharging shield. It's actually easier to beat many levels without shooting at all. Crazy.I only paid 25 cents or something, but it would have been better spent on a gumball. I'm mostly just irked that I wasted my time.			",306,76,8,29,26,3,41

												Take the standard top down shooter formula and add the ability to attack ground units ala xevious, an upgrade system of UN Squadron plus the unreal engine and you get an very enjoyable, simple yet satisfying sh'mup. I definitely recommend this game to anybody who enjoys the the genera or those feeling nostalgic yet still want the ability to increase difficulty. One criticism I have is the lack of a timer beyond determining your bonus at the end of the stage. In most Sh'mups its often  taken for granted how much it pushes you to improve, even in a campaign setting.			",111,14,0,14,10,0,5

												Revolution Ace is an astonishingly enjoyable arcade shoot-em-up.The graphics is at full HD 1920 x 1080p and there is eye candy in abundance with a huge array of effects and transitions.Playing with an X-box 360 controller is fully supported and the game play is fluid and accessible.  There are four difficulty settings to cater for players of varying skill levels.The menu system is well laid out and easy to use.The sound tracks are great metal riffs providing a good audio adrenaline pulse.  Game sounds are well sampled and well synchronized with what is observed on screen.Stages have beautifully textured terrain and plenty of variety.  There are a good assortment of units to destroy including air units, ground vehicles and turrets.  Buildings and terrain take damage too.  Floating collectible bonus spawns on destruction of certain units or buildings.This game is well polished and has a good replay value.Rating  9.5 / 10			",355,35,40,87,58,1,118
