												Couldn't even play once installed.  Must be some sort of problem which needs to be corrected.  Really disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I quite like the game as it is one of the very few Rugby games out there, it's certainly not perfect but it is a lot of fun.  The main issue I am encountering is CRASHING, it is constant and makes the game totally unplayable, very disappointed and am hoping for an update soon as I wish to spend more time playing!  Cannot reccomend at present as unplayable otherwise pretty fun for Rugby fans (although not the polished article).  3/10.**UPDATE** - Shall re-trial the game to see if I can get rid of the crashing issue and the report back. Original game was a lot of fun so hoping that re-installing will remedy the issue!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
