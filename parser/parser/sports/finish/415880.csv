												The reason why I have such a large amount of playtime is because I've played since novemberA fantastic Windjammers-esque game that holds up on it's own! I've been playing this every day from January and it's great! Only 2 developers and still they managed to create a game that has just the right gameplay to be inviting to all, but while at the same time being able to give enough depth for a good competitive scene to arise.Do yourself a favor and get this one! I don't write reviews often, and when I do it's something really good.As of March 7th the game is free on Playstation+ for one month So if you own a PS4 try it out there!			",214,22,4,20,15,2,23

												This is more or less a modern reimagining of the Neo Geo arcade title ""WindJammers"".If tennis, frisbee and 90's XTREMEism had a midnight encounter this would be their love child.The title is terrific fun in nice, bite sized doses yet you may find yourself playing for hours.  It is simple to learn but with a deeper learning curve (a la Rocket League).  Very pure and arcadey fun that favours reflexes just as much as out-witting your opponent via positioning and tactics.Does exactly what it sets out to do and at a very fair price point.  The (very small) Dev team have also been active and communicative in the forums and have shown respect for their customers. Highly recommended!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I already played Disc Jam in the open beta and decided to host a members only f2p tournament for my clan, because the game itself provides great mechanics, simple controls, 1on1 and 2on2 based matches and lots of fun. My mates thought so too and we had an evening full of laughing, screaming and cheering. And even though it was in beta, no errors (or similar) occured.The atmosphere is like a mixture of Brawlhalla and Rocket League. There's not much to explain in terms of gameplay except: 1. Throw that disc as fast, as hard and as tricky as you can. 2. Catch.3. Retry.I can definitely recommend this game if you have a controller at hand... didn't play it with keyboard so I can't really say much about that.			",273,82,4,15,20,3,22

												Disc Jam is a simple concept very masterfully done; the developers have spared no expense with the advanced physics of the character's movements and the motion of the disc. It's a game that's easy to play, hard to master - with your understanding of the game increasing with every single match. It's somewhat addicting and you'll find yourself saying one more game often, it's fast-paced, fun and so intense. You'll wonder why you didn't pick it up sooner.			",15,1,0,2,4,0,1

												Awesome futuristic tennis game. People on here are comparing it to Rocket League.. Rocket League is basically cars that can fly that play soccer. Disc Jam basically is tennis with a disc and no racquet.If I was to compare it to anything else I would say a mash between Speedball and any tennis game mixed in with feels of the old Half Life mod ""Ricochet""Easily worth $15 and definitely worth the $10 I picked it up on sale for.

												I've been playing since the alpha released for this game last year and since then I've seen it go through some major changes, updates, etc.The biggest thing I think I can compliment is how responsive the devs are to suggestions. I don't think I've ever seen devs who worked this closely with the community to bring the players what they want and adapt to suggestion the players might have regarding features or balance changes.As you can see, I have (as of this review) a couple hundred hours in the game already. Even though it looks simple in concept, the game has a ton of replayability that will keep bringing you back for more. That's not even including the future maps, modes, etc. that the devs have already stated they intend to add.The game play is very similar to an old airhockey-esque game called Windjammers. The goal is simple, throw the disc into the enemy's goal and you score. First to 50 wins the set, and the first to two sets wins the match. Much like Rocket League, this game is very easy to pick up, but also extremely difficult to master. You'll find yourself destroying opponents left and right, only to turn around and get stomped and wanting to improve so you can be even better than the person who beat you.For only $15 ($10 as of the review because of a sale) this game is a steal and everyone should be sure to pick it up.

												This is a perfect example of a game that should be Early Access. The price is just too much for what you get.The game is cool. You play 1v1 or 2v2 frisbee on steroids. Some might remember Windjammers from the past. It's essentially the same. You can dash around and do special throws with street fighter like inputs. Four different characters have their own values for speed, throw strength, etc and you can unlock costumes, tags, yadda yadda.The only thing you can do is play online or practice throwing the disc at a wall. Online games have no skill matchmaking (Edit: added in v1.08), you are just matched by connection quality. The game lets you choose between 150ms, 100ms or 60ms ping when you search for a match. Guess what, finding a 60ms game takes ages (yet) and it can still have issues.The game is also peer-to-peer based. Games with bad connection qualities are an issue. The collision detection gets way too bad.So please get this right, the game is fun. Bought it with a friend and we have a blast playing 2v2. But there are issues and this feels more like a beta. Many people compare it to Rocket League, feels more like SARPBC. If this was Early Access I'd recommend for the potential. But as it stands it's not enough bang for the buck.tl;dr+ windjammers+ online coop+ fast skillbased game+ short matches+/- ps4 crossplay ?- not enough players(- no skillmatching, Edit: added in v1.08)- p2p issues- prize (esp considering they bascially give it away for free on the ps4 this month)- only online, no offline bot matches- lacks overall polish and balance			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a simple game to understand, the controls can feel a little awkward at first but after a couple of hours they start to feel pretty good. It's really fun to play at a high skill level and even though there is a slight lack in some content like different courts or being able to play against bots you just need to remember that it's only 2 developers that are making the game so all of the features that currently don't exist will at some point, just need to give them some time.

												I really really really really want to recommend this game, but unless you have friends that can play locally or online, stay away.  It only took me half an hour to realize that no one plays this (at least not in the region I'm in) and would be getting games with outrageous pings.  The timing on some of the moves also need a little tweaking, and the way the game reads directional inputs can be wonky with a Steam Controller (everything else works great).There is also no set up for bot matches or anything, which would have saved the game for me.  I don't mind playing against AI, but the lack of even that option for people with few offline friends kinda kills it for me.			",299,40,1,36,12,3,23

												Welcome to Disc Jam! The competitive sport you never knew was your absolute favorite. A Frisbee disc/Action game hybrid.... but this isn’t just ultimate Frisbee, so put your putters away. This is Pong on steroids all ramped up with special moves, dives, and lobs shots! THIS is the vision Windjammers strived to be years ago, but revamped with the technology of the Unreal4 Engine.The goal of Disc Jam is simple. You take 2 players (or 2v2) on a court similar to a tennis court, and take turns throwing a frisbee at each other in an attempt to get it past your opponent to score some points. First to 50 wins a set, and a match is best of 3 sets. The gameplay is fast and frantic with diving, lob-shots, special moves, curve shots, guard plays and an arsonal of tactics and mechanics to keep each player guessing and keeping each new game fresh. And it’s always crazy when you throw out a special move, and your opponent catches it and shoots a special right back your way. I especially recommend this game for adrenaline junkies. There is always something exciting going down, and as soon as the match is over you just want that rush again. With frantically fast gameplay, easy co-op to comp, loads of unlockables, and  simple-to-learn-but-arduous-to-master style, you and your friends are going to have limitless amount of good times.  I give Disc Jam a well deserved 8/10, with room to grow			",212,9,4,12,14,4,14

												Disc Jam is a very fun, fast-paced and competitive multiplayer sports game.Graphics:It won't make you go ""Wooow"" but it is certainly well-made and doesn't look bad at all.Performance:It runs well for me and even if it doesn't for you, you can turn down the graphics quite a bit to fix this.Music:There are only three different tracks in the game so they do get stale after a while but they fit the game very well.Sound:The sound design is good, nothing special to say about this though.Gameplay:The matches can be very fun, especially when you're playing with your friends in 2v2. Disc Jam is easy to pick up but hard to master. The problem right now is that the playerbase is very small on PC, so long queue times and big skillgaps when playing on random are not uncommon. But when you do find someone who is on the same level, you're gonna have lots of fun!The controls are good but playing on keyboard is substantually harder than with a controller.By playing random matches and voting on game streams, you can also earn an ingame currency. It can be used to get random prizes which are cosmetics like skins, taunts and tags. This also provides another small reason for playing some more.The characters are all very interesting and well-balanced with their personal strengths and weaknesses.The developers are planning to implement even more content so the game should improve even more in the future.There are a couple connection bugs but they are not too annoying/serious.

Product received for free
												Apparently I have been playing frisbee the wrong way. This not only has a point but does not require a field that the frisbee will still eventually fly out of. This costs $2.00 less than my last wham-o professional disc and this comes with people to play with. As for the game, the types of throws and the way to control the disc's intended flight path are outstanding. The throwing is simple yet able to perform complex curves and arcs at varying heights, angles and velocities. You play singles or doubles with opposing teams on either side of a net. It looks a bit like tennis in that respect. You serve (throw) the disc and the fun begins. From here the gameplay reminds me of raquetball if raquetball had a net instead of a wall. There are no ""out of bounds"" on the sides as the dics bounces off the walls of the court you are playing on.  I have no idea if the disc reaches or bounces off the ceiling but since typing this made me think of that, I will try it and keep the answer to myself. I wish I had a real one of these courts and discs in which to play fetch with my canine friend. Back on topic, this is a sport that I did not know I wanted to play and I am thankful that Mr. Timothy Rapp of High Horse Entertainment was nice enough to let me give this a go.  This is recommended to everyone who had, has, or is thinking about a frisbee. This is also recommended to anyone who thinks Badminton needs upgrade. This is also recommended to Steve Rodgers, he will understand why. I have to also recommend this to fans of ""breakout"" and ""arkanoid"" type games although though there is no breaking nor arkanoia there are angles and reflections to use while throwing the disc. If you haven't checked DiscJam out, you are doing it wrong.

												This game is pretty fun. Basically pick up and play granted you actually took time to go through the tutroial. Pros:Easy Learning CurveCons:Depending on time zones....the waiting period is pretty bad. Although I wont knock it as this is an early access game. Still listing as a con though for the time being. ________________________________________________________________________________The prize machine is an okay concept although I have come to think that once you find a main character you enjoy playing with often and actually use very often, You dont seem to get very many new skins from the prize machine for the particular character. Could just be me here on this one. Although it is cool that every prize is only 1000 XYZ (Forget what the item is called...credits maybe) I think this games prize component would greatly benefit if a player was able to choose from a list of prizes rather than pull an arm and hope for the best. But this current mechanic is probably what is keeping most players coming back. ________________________________________________________________________________Final thoughts:If you have 15 dollars burning a hole in your pocket and you cant find any game to satisfy the gamer in you......Go ahead and buy this game. Just dont plan on finding any opponents after midnight in your time zone.			",21,3,0,4,2,0,0

												Fun, addicting, quick matches.  Steep learning curve (especially without a great way to practice offline), but the mechanics are fun to play with and try to master.If you can convince a few friends to grab it with you and learn together, you can avoid the initial headache of getting stomped online, as there is no skill-based matchmaking upon initial release.  Controller recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At the core, Disc Jam is fun but it gets a bit ""samey"" after a while. The addition of different modes, arenas or characters might make it more interesting. Also the playerbase is gone. It's 9pm EST on a Friday when I'm writing this and there are literally 15 people logged in.			",206,43,8,19,16,3,5

												Disc Jam is fun.It has the potential to be as good as rocket league. But unless the developers decide to expand their (2 man) team i doubt they can produce the content necessary to keep people interested.Despite that i dont regret my purchase one bit, like i said its fun.If you can get past the fact that the que times are a tiny smudge longer than your average competetive online game. You can have a blast throwing discs with your friends and literally explode the opposition out of the court.			",189,24,7,17,38,1,25

												This game is actually really fun, it has enormous potential to become the next big Rocket League. The feeling is good, the commands are responsive and the gameplay overall is really fun.It lacks a few key item for me to get hooked tho:<1)Single player. Really? No AI to play against for fun? (or am I dumb and just didn't found it?)2)Different fields.If you have no problem getting owned by total monsters or spending 10 minutes destroying people that plays like bots, it's definitely a cool game to buy. Me i'd like to have a single player arcade-like game mode.			",34,3,1,18,1,0,6

												Just bought the game last night and have already clocked in almost 8 hours as of now.  Its just like Wind Jammers for anyone that is old enough to remember that game.   It's also the PC version of Air Hockey.   Its fun challenging and certainly a game ill enjoy playing for months or even years to come.First thing I want anyone who buys this amazing game ($10 as of now).  Invest in a controller.  YOU NEED a controller.  I use my PS4 controller, but any will do.  Its extrememly difficult to play with just the keyboard.   The lottery system works with its free currency, but to be completely honest I wish there was a cash shop to buy skins and such.  Maybe an alternate currency?  Overall for a simple game, its extrememly fun.   Match making can be interesting as to who you go up against.  I have smashed people who are obviously new to the game, and also been destroyed by people who have been playing since the Wind Jammer days.  Either way games are fast. Most are done in under 10 minutes. 100% worth the money!!			",12,2,0,8,1,0,1

												Really fun game and quite addictive once you get the controls down. I wouldn't recommend playing this with keyboard as it can be quite tricking picking and choosing your shots using the keys.The art style is funky as well as the music and the loot system drops every 3 matches or so. This game is nothing like Rocket League, the only comparison is that it's from a relatively unknown dev team.This is a new game with only 2 devs bringing this to life, and it's already really good. I can see the potential for further content similar to how Psyonix (Rocket League) bring in new maps & games modes each season.This game will blow up once it gets fully dedicated servers and an efficient competitive game mode.8/10 would recommend.Pros;Fun & differentResponsive controlsCool audio effects and musicCons;Dedicated servers should be the next port of callQueue times could be quicker or matches should have more sets to last longerThe matchmaking can be a little ropey sometimes			",80,3,0,9,7,2,26

												I've had my eye on Disc Jam since November. I opted out of being in the open beta because I wanted to make sure I played when the netcode was good and almost all bugs were worked out of the game. I can't believe it's taken this long for a Windjammers influenced ""clone"" to make headlines. I'm especially glad that the first clone to gain major traction is genuinely good. This game is a bit more complex, but the core gameplay is all the same.

												The rightful successor of Windjammers, Disc Jam uses its mechanics and adds more. You have a shield to deflect the disc and you can charge it to use a Super throw if the disc is slow enough. If you throw right away the disc you get a boost and it can happen 3 times, 4th time you can use a Super. Of course multiply this with all the different curves you can create, the lob to throw the disc on the ground,  quick curves, dashes etc  and you can really outsmart your opponent. Mindgames ensues.Very rewarding arcade game, suitable to play 5mn or 2h, you can play single or 2v2 games, 2v2 local online, 2v2 online with a friend etc. If you just want to play localy, you have to go to offline and everything will be unlocked by default, which is nice to have fun right away and for each player to have a personnal color and such.The game is a little barebone as I write this, you have 4 characters, each slightly different, 1 map, 2 musics, ~10 colors (haven't counted), ~8 taunts and victory poses (haven't counted again), something like 50 Titles and 50 Icons. So you can really customize your character and player profile.You get all of this by playing which will make you earn money(even in loss), which you can use to the prize machine to randomly get an item. There are colors and rarity. If you get an item that you already have you sell it for 500 coins ( each usage of the prize machine costs 1000 coins).Ranked matches, leaderboards and statistics are coming soon, crossplay will follow with the PS4 online.Talking about online it's very good, seems to be P2P, you can see your ping at any moment and can narrow your search to lower pings.  I find games in 10/20 seconds, it can take more time depending of the number of players.On PC you have a chat box to write what you want, even though you have very little time in game to talk between rounds, that's why the devs have added a quick message feature like in rocket league using the Dpad.Overrall the experience is very enjoyable, the mechanics are simple to understand yet hard to master with a great skill curve (not talking about the mechanic which is also called skill curve haha) like Windjammers has. (the arcade game it is based on).The devs are following the game very very closely and are updating/adding things weekly. It has a great future ahead and I think it deserves to be bought even right now.			",256,42,2,29,7,1,14

												**READ BEFORE COMMENT**The game is good, I like the game, but only when the servers are good.This is a personal experience.Pros:+Fun game+Challenging Aspects+Huge Potential for the Future+Engine runs really smoothlyCons:-Server Issues-Low Playerbase-Feels barebones-Could do a singleplayer modeAs I said, the game has an insanely large amount of potential and I am aware that this game was a two man job.However, I feel that the game doesn't deliver enough, it's MP only and it can take a while to find a match at times on an EU server, and when I do, the ping is above 150 and nearly unplayable. If they introduced a singleplayer mode, say challenges or AI, then I can get onboard with that.As for aesthetics, the faces for the characters are fixed which adds a lack of reality to this especially when it's made with Unreal Engine 4. tl;dr I don't think that at this point the game is up to par in its current state, but it is barely out of release.I wish nothing but the best for the devs because they have created a diamond in the rough.

												SUCH a FUN game!Inherently...If you know ping pong, you'll know Disc Jam.If you know Air Hockey, you'll know DJ.If you know Tennis, you'll know DJ.If you know STREET FIGHTER, you'll be right at home as well.The timing, the different types of throws, the power ups, the tension...this is such a great game.  And at the price it's a MUST BUY.Great job and Kudos to Jay and Tim!			",283,43,19,32,40,3,32

It look very fun, but it's the dead of the fun.+ Good visual engine.- But ""unreal engine"" on a mini game make people think it's a normal game (because yes, this is only a mini game).- Empty of content, that's why it's a mini game.- The worst matchmacking ever seen (and I played 1000+h to ""R6 siege""), today we played 7 matches, all were against pros, and we are noobs ; and it was always the same thing when we tried to play. It's a torture, we loose all and we get insulted more than in ""rocket league"" for 5/7 matches (""rekt, noobs..."").- No controller and you will almost never catch the disc (and I played 2500+h on ""rocket league"" with a keyboard , you can verify).- It's superficial on my negative review, but the 4 characters are ridiculous, like on almost all games, but here they are weird too, it's special...- I don't like the sounds, bad ambiance.- 4 moves (a linear, a rounded left and right, a lifted) and the special one (3 differents, you choose), it's very poor for this kind of game. I want to collect some new moves, or create my owns, to be surprised, to live a progression on the game, a style difference...I have many reasons to put a bad review, the most important is simple : the game could be fun, but it's not. The matchmacking without stat system to put rookies with rookies, pros with pros, is eliminatory too.I bought it for me and 2 friends because it's a kind of game I like (sport + powers...), but we hated, and we wont play it more.

												Fun and addictive game. A lot more fun with a friend though and not too many online atm. This game however has a unique idea and has a lot of potential. I hope to see more people play though as matchmaking takes 5 mins or sometimes more. This game is made to be played better with a controller though so keyboard players have a disadvantage when it comes to curving.			",18,4,0,3,0,0,3

												Could be a good but not great game if you played locAL Co-Op but as a online game....... your having a laugh man.Whats even more funny is people giving it the rocket league comparision, check my stats for RL and believe me when i say there is no comparision what so ever between this game and RL.Conrollers are a bit clunky and if you get as far as the tutorial you will find that whatever task is delt you will do it fine until the final attempt ( always 3 times ) which then sends you on a button bashing stress related ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ final task.Movment is not great the slide option either works or misses by miles and some of the shots are non returnable even if you standing right in the path.If you ove RL and believe the rumours posted here that this game is the next RL then your tripping, just check the downloads. Buy if your going to play local Co-Op but stay away if you want it for online			",136,25,3,9,36,1,10

												This game is not good. It's very redundant and lacks a lot of depth. A lot of the times, some of the wall shots are harder to read just so everyone isn't a god at this game. It's cheap tricks like this that really hamper the game. Disc Jam is fun for like an hour, then it becomes repetitive and extremely boring.			",2,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Comparisons to Rocket League overhype this game and do it a disservice. There's a solid learning curve with good controls, but nothing felt ""fun"" or ""exciting"" about practicing the way it does with Rocket League. To compare it to another ""league,"" Lethal League's twitchy back and forth was way more engaging to me. Decent overall, but I doubt enough people besides a niche group are going to care to keep multiplayer going.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great Game! Although Im From Australia and Oceanic matchmaking rarely finds me an opponent to play. Unplayable over 150ms as you cant see the disc. Big waste of time joing a US West game, massive epic fail and guaranteed loss. Think it would benefit if it had a server browser so you can browse other servers and see a ping/if anyones online. Even an offline game if they had bots with difficulty levels would be cool when you cant find an opponent. I have sat here many nights in queue and have fallen asleep before finding someone.Just fingers crossed a lot more people buy the game and it becomes more popular. Keep spreading the news that its a great and fun game!			",41,5,3,6,1,1,1

Fun online and fun unlockables to collect. The only minor thing I can say about this game, is the online tends to take at least 40 second or so to connect. Other than that, get the game full or on sale. Its worth it. Now let me play some more!			",161,20,4,43,5,2,12
