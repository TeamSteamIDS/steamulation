								This is my favorite VIVE game so far (I have about 25). Just be prepared for a true workout as you get better at it. Tonight I made it to wave 26 and was sweating like no other! This is truely a mix of Tron discs and Captain America's shield. At about level 15 it starts getting really intense with dodging, shields up, spinning around and throwing your shield. I will say that the controls when launching the disc still don't feel absolute. About 80% of the time I hit my target but there are times when you KNOW you launched correctly and the disc didn't do what you want. Kind of like Wii or Move controllers. When this gets fixed, I will be in heaven.I am really looking forward to where this game goes next! BRAVO!!!!			",419,204,23,37,58,13,58

								Download the demo, it's free and has all the game mechanics in it. You don't gain anything by picking up the early access game which has seen no attention from the dev shortly after it went live. Look at the ""eary access game"" notes from the developer written in June of 2016 and feel free to browse the trello board ( http://trello.com/b/oOCNIEaS ) listing the tasks he was planning on but never got around to:Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?“The game will be in Early Access for at least a month, until it has proper assets (sound, graphics), as well as more content.It's a shame I can't recommend this game; it missed all of its early access milestones. It seems the developer had great ideas to make the game more fun.			",271,79,4,45,19,3,10

								This game has that captain America meets tron vibe going on. It's fun to play now and I'm looking forward to updates. Nice work so far Dev!Some suggestions. Duel shields. Different enemiesAbility to smash the bad guys when they get too close. Better collision when shield flies into the enemy instead of flying throughA more discs of tron style arenaSome advice to all the wave based arcade style games in development. Please give us players a way to pick our starting level because it gets kind of old to start from level one every time.			",74,7,1,0,8,2,2

Early Access Review
								Wasn't entirely sure what to expect from the game. Was kind of hoping for something with tron style disc throwing... This is not that but it's still interesting. The disc is basicaly a generic physics object so it's like throwing a lofty brick, not a frisby. It can be quite difficult to aim your throw with it as well due to expectation on how it should behave but I suspect it's something you'll overcome with practice. It's in early access at time of writing so the mechanics might change as well, possibly improved. The system is workable at the moment regardless. What makes it interesting is the ability to call it back to the hand of your choice and getting a score multiplier for hitting enemies that you had previously missed from behind as it returns to your hand. This makes it more dynamic and makes missing a bit less frustraiting as you might have a second shot at taking out the enemy for an even higher reward.While held it acts as a shield and allows you to reflect enemies shots back at them. It was a really nice design choice to make a hud on the shield that it gives you targeting reticle with which to aim shots back. I think this could be expanded in later developement to show player health on the shield and more importantly a radar like feature that shows where enemies are realitive to the direction you are facing so you know when they are charging up for a shot behind you.Basically the game is space pirate trainer with throwable weapon instead of guns. The difference is it is much more reasonably priced for a wave based game and thus gets my recommendation on bang for buck value.			",780,279,26,168,152,13,154

								A simple and quite fun game. You face increasingly difficult waves of flying drones, armed only with a shield. You can throw it, Captain America style, or use it to reflect drone shots back at themselves (or angle the shield to bounce the shots at other drones). It also takes advantage of Roomscale, allowing you to dodge shots, which slow down slightly when they get close to you.The dev, as well so far, seems fairly responsive, which is another plus in my book.

								I'm writing this after jumping in and making a few attempts, and finally topping out at wave 18. Definitely a fun game even this early into Early Access, and it has a ton of potential to be really incredible with future development. Dev is active on Reddit, releases weekly, and keeps a public Trello board with roadmap and progress.As others have said, imagine you're captain America trapped in Tron, and you won't be too far off.Prepare to get a workout, and make sure to wear your wrist straps. Can't wait to see where this one goes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Well that was intense.  Just finished my first game, 23 minutes of action has left me drenched in sweat and with a big grin on my face.  Slow to start but by wave 16 I was constantly ducking and weaving while lobbing my shield like a maniac and laughing my♥♥♥♥♥off.  I refunded holopoint as the constant spinning made me feel sick but the enemies seem to stick to one direction when it gets intense which I think helps.  If you have a vive, buy this now.

								Very good idea that works well as a VR concept.It´s very simple but that doesn´t mean it isn´t fun! Some more enviroments, ene+ies and shield skins would be welcome, perhaps also something to occupy your other hand, but it´s early days still and the Dev has already listened to feedback and provided us with an update, so i´m very hopeful for this game and i can´t wait to see what comes next.

								As it is very early access I'll keep this light. I enjoyed playing it as is for now and already we are getting frequent updates from the developer. Well worth it for under a fiver.UPDATED:  It's been 4 months since any word from the developer despite requests from users in the discussion forums.  This is simply part of the 'great VR cash grab' of 2016.  Avoid and lets not reward this behavior!			",350,83,49,15,63,10,30

								Refreshing game after you play so many shooting/zombie games. Simple premise but highly addicting and fun. The developer is very open to ideas and is improving this game weekly. I would like to see a global leaderboard leaderboard and perhaps co-op play down the line could be fun. For a price of a Star Bucks coffee this is defanitely worth checking out.			",64,25,2,1,10,1,0

								Disclamer:I was sent a copy of this game out of the blue by the developer, who had seen a livestream I did with my htc vive. It basically said ""here's a copy if you want to make a video on it"" with a game key. Frankly, it looked very sketchy, and I didn't even believe it till I activated it on Steam. My point is, while I got it for free, I'm not obligated to say anything nice about it, or even review this game at all. I just thought I should explain why I got it for free.Short Review:It's basically Space Pirate Trainer, but instead of guns, all you have is a shield that you can throw at enemies and deflect bullets with. If you like Space Pirate Trainer, you'll like this.Long Review:Really, the short review sums it up perfectly. I never really got all the excitement behind Space Pirate Trainer. It's just too repetitive in my opinion. So why am I recommending this game? It's still fun. Is it gonna keep you entertained for hours on end? No (just look at my play time). But the time I played it was enjoyable and worked up a sweat. Would I pay $5? Of course not. Knowing what I do now, I'd wait till it's on sale for 50% of or so. That's just my opinion. If you enjoyed Space Pirate Trainer, you'll probably think it's well worth the $5.If you like Space Pirate Trainer, you'll probably enjoy it and think it's worth the $5.If you don't like Space Pirate Trainer or thought it was boring, you'll probably think it's too repetitive and will want to wait till it's on sale.

								Enemies spawn all the way around which makes most of the game just turning around to see where everyone is. Then when you see one you throw your shield at it, which doesn't feel that great. Then you keep turning around and listen for the sound of enemies trying to shoot you. In the end this is just a variant of Space Pirate Trainer which is a much more complete game (even though its also Early Access), both in visuals and gameplay. It might just be worth its low price though even if you get bored after 15 minutes.			",183,61,4,19,44,3,55

								Really... Demo coming out after the game? Feel like i wasted money cause i dont even enjoy the game, if the demo was out first i would have saved my money. My main issue is its very hard to be accurate, this and any other games that have a frisby style mechanic. Guns np but no matter how much I adjust in a game like this I cant make it accurate. Really wish I had the demo first...Curious if any frisby enthusiasts have played this to hear what they think regarding the physics.			",94,20,0,11,7,1,2

								This game has really become something great! I bought it back when it first came out because the demo seemed promising and I wanted to support the game. Most of the VR games I have backed in such a way have yet to evolve into something awesome but this one has! The audio cues help immensely and everything feels solid with enough depth to keep you coming back. Now that the core gameplay is sweet I can only hope the dev can add in some content to keep things interesting but in any case this is a good investment. If you like active games like holopoint/SPT you try this.			",119,50,4,6,32,4,4
