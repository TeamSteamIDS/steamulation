												I'm not too sure what people were expecting with this collection, but from the reviews I hvae read, you people have been far too harsh for what it is and when it was made.Moto Racer 1 is a PS1 game which, I believe, was ported to the PC (or released at the same time as the PS1 version). The graphics are old and it's going to have the odd glitch and incompatibility now and then. Anyone without common sense should know that your 'Octa core processor with SLI'd GTX 770s' would have compatibility issues with a game from the 90s.Additionally, you cannot expect a game that was made for the PS1 to be fancy. If a HD remake was produced, the original old-school gamers who played this game probably wouldn't have liked it. Why expect a game or a collection that's released onto Steam to be new and sparkly? Developers ARE allowed to release old games onto Steam.So overall, I recommend this merely because I congratulate the developers for releasing this great PS1 game onto Steam. I've played all of the games in this collection enough in my childhood and away from Steam to know this deserves a recommendation even if Steam says I've only played for less than an hour.

												Got this game on the Week long sale on 20/07/2015. First thing I gotta say, yes, it works. All the games loaded an run. I do agree with other reviews saying that they could have tried to make it more compatible. There are unplayable areas (mostly when you're playing a dirt race with many competitors on screen) and MASSIVE slowdowns... Could be better.Now the biggest reason for the Negative review: they f*** up Moto Racer 2! Why was the great, perfect soundtrack changed? WHY? I do believe I left Moto Racer's 2 CD more time in my Stereo then in the PC, just for how great the soundtrack is. Then I load the game with high expectations for a battery solo to start the video and I get a totally souless music in a new intro video, and then the menu screen hits and where is the beautiful Punk Rock music? This should be advertised as it is on GOG. I would not have spent not even the less then a dollar I did. Total lack of respect with the game fans.			",150,27,9,15,18,1,7

												First off, I will admit that after the download, Moto Racer 1 did not work UNTIL, after about 2 minutes of googling, I found the fix (I will put the link at the end of this review. Notes on the fix will also be at the end). I only bought this game for nostalgia, and boy did it deliver! The graphics are not too hot, but that is because these games are old (Moto Racer 1 came out in 1997). I don't recommend this game to people looking for simulators, but if you like easy-to-load, fast-paced arcade bike racing games, then these are for you!THIS IS JUST FOR MOTO RACER ONE      https://steamcommunity.com/app/324110/discussions/0/613938575207390002/?insideModal=1    There's the link to the fix. It's a super easy fix to do, but it was found in a version not on Steam version (Duh!), so the only problem that I found was in the middle of a championship race when it said ""Illegal Version"" and I couldn't accelerate. The single races and time trials have all worked. I don't think I will be able to unlock maps since I can't advance in the championship, but there is an ""unlock all tracks"" cheat online, so I did that.			",92,1,5,9,4,0,1

												Hey fellow steam users!I bought this on 11/13/2014 and I have tested both Moto Racer 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all playable. Here's my review for each one:1. Moto racer, the bonafide classic. not many tracks, but the game is wonderful, old-school, and arcadey. A definate must-have! 4:3 only, use the ""black bars"" mode.2. Just like its predecessor, this game is wonderful and fast and arcadey. Much more tracks this time around, but the game is a tad more realistic and not quite as arcadey as MR1. If you add custom widescreen resolutions lower than 1024x768, usually they appear in-game.3. Moto Racer 3 is a departure from the second one as there is a heavier focus on ""arcade realism"". The COD of the Moto Racer series, but this game is very enjoyable still and as always, has a wonderful sense of speed. 4:3 only.4. The classic from ios, this game was created with auto-acceleration in mind. Play this with a controller and don't be as heavy on the throttle! The shoulder buttons are best for acceleration as button A is hard-coded to be Boost. 4x3 only, just like the older versions. This game is fairly faithful to its predecessors and is a good time waster, but not quite as good as the originals.Overall, i'd say if you are a fan of the series, by all means get this title. It's cheaper than buying each one on GOG, and it's great fun for all ages!The game had extreme bugs on release, but on my windows 8.1, amd fx 8350, and nvidia gtx 660, these games run fine and have few problems.

												This is a collection, so be aware that the original games have not been improved upon.The store page is not ambiguous about that, but I'd rather reiterate because you might have different expectations in this age of HD remakes.Having loved the original Moto Racer back in the day, a straight port was fine by me, except...Moto Racer 1 won't launch on my machine -- launcher fails to set colour depth. There might be a way around it, like setting my display to 16-bit manually, but I can't be arsed right now. I might put effort into finding a workaround later though, because I recall this one being my favourite.Moto Racer 2 does launch, but there's no sound during races, no music or SFX. Plays well, but feels weird because of that.Moto Racer 3 works (huzzah!). Don't think I played this one back in the day (or not much); it seems less arcadey and fun than the previous two instalments, but that's just my impression after a single race. Moto Racer 15th anniversary is the most recent entry (you can tell it's modern because you accelerate with the right trigger, not the A button!) and it's utter garbage. Not only does it manage to be uglier than the other, way older entries, but more shamefully it plays poorly. Not the game I cared about anyway, but dang, morbid curiosity is the only reason to bother trying it at all -- and even then I couldn't finish a single lap in a cross race. The way it handles just feels entirely wrong, like someone's first Unity game on XBLIG.So all in all, if I find a way to make sound work in 2 and for 1 to launch at all, maybe I'll spend some time with this, reminiscing. But I cannot recommend it in good faith.(Oh, and I spent more than 5 minutes with this -- but Steam only counts time spent in the launcher apparently) ",451,203,25,73,43,5,53

												It is unbelieveable, how much crap the people are writing, without getting their stuff fixed themself. Sorry about that, but it is really necessary to explain everyone, how wrong the negative reviews are! 1. All parts of Moto Racer got controller support! Even the 3rd is playable with the XBOX360 Controller! You can change the controls in every part. From Moto Racer 1 - 3! Just check the configuration settings in the games (or launcher in the 3rd part).2. There was nowhere written, that this collection is a remake or a HD release, so complaining about that is totally unnecessary! With the right settings and a little engine modding the games look really good!3. There are no soundbugs at all. The people complaining about that, are just using some random codecpacks, so the game doesn't work right. I got a Realtek HD Onboard Soundcard and no sound problems at all. Everywhere is sound...even in the movies! Config your computers right, then you won't have that problems!4. The AI is too hard?....NOPE...you are just too weak! Easy AI is easy! 5. The games work like a charm on Win7 x64! No problems, no crashes, no complains! They work even better, then they were on Win95/98/MeThe collection is perfect. If you liked Moto Racer back in the old days, you will feel really nostalgic playing this collection.  I had a smile on my face in every part of the collection. It was like being a child again. Really fun! I will spend more time playing this collection, since it is a really good revive of the good old Moto Racer games! Totally recommending it!			",668,230,26,93,62,9,120

												This game is based on the classic game for Playstation 1 and for the PC.  This game is just like the old game, fun fun fun.  From reading other reviews, it seems like some were expecting this game to be up to date graphics and did not notice that it is called a Collection.  These are the original games, and the 15th Anniversary Game you get to play them all and relive all the fun over again.  If you have played this game in the past, I highly recommend that you pick this game up!			",87,11,7,13,33,2,20

												If you like Moto Racer from back in the old Windows 95 days this is perfect for you. 1, 2 and 3 play extremely well and work on computers now a days like an emulator for an N64 or NES. the remake 15th version plays a lot like Moto Racer DS which is not the best thing to happen at all to Moto Racer. I suggest mostly playing 1 2 and 3. Leave the remake alone. Pretty sweet though.  10 Bucks is insane though. This should at least be worth 4.50. So yeah. MAJOR nostalgia factor if you can get 1,2 and 3 to work. Ignore the remake. We got it? Good.			",228,27,37,31,16,1,39

												Don't get this collection. I have fond memories of playing MotoRacer in my youth. So getting to play the first one again was a blast (Even if I had to lower the quality of the polygons because I was getting lag) until I made it to the fourth championship where the game told me that I was running an ""illegal copy of the game"" and I couldn't accelerate. So the steam verion I purchased is running an illegal copy of the game. Not to mention that there are so many issues and bugs with the first and second MotoRacer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												UPDATE 23/06/2015 -------------I just checked the game, again.Moto Racer and Moto Racer 2 are fully working now.I'm running Windows 8 x64 Pro :)Moto Racer and Moto Racer 2 are the best ones from this collection.This collection is only suitable for collectors who know these games, it's not a remake or HD remaster ! These are the same old Windows 95/98 games. btw. there's still this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ .net game launcher ... why can't the developer who made this for steam add an icon for it ? It's just a click in Visual Studio. 3 seconds of work >_<!!-------------------------------------------------------------------------I bought it only for nostalgia. I played Moto Racer and Moto Racer 2 everyday on my PSone  in my childhood ! I don't recommend it, because the soundtrack is not working and the video sequences, too ! BTW, It works well on Windows 7 !If they gonna fix this issue I'll change my review, but so ..... and the 15th Anniversary Edition is just some cheap trash, skip it !			",493,39,35,27,26,7,22

												When you press ""PLAY"" button it opens up a small menu window where you can select Moto Racer 1 - 4. Steam only tracks the menu, not the actual game you play but the menu only last until you select the game so it's not easy to write a review unless you leave the menu on for awhile.OK now, on to to more relevant review. Mostly no problem to run on my laptop except Moto Racer 3. The error message leads you to think that it's a driver or Direct-x problem. Actually it's a monitor resolution issue. Re-directing output to an external monitor and selecting 1280x960 resolution fixed this. Also might be needed is to manually assign texture memory in the advanced options. Mine had to be set at 256 MB, the default 32 MB didn't work.Update Mar 2, 2017Found out that the critical setting needed is Anti-Aliasing; it must be other than off. Another issue that may cause it to crash to desktop is if you have a game recorder in recording mode while the game transitions between menu and gameplay mode. Avoid the crash by turning off the recording function before entering the race and turning it back on as soon you enter the game mode. 1024x768 works and default 32 MB textures also work as long as AA is on. Game runs fine with the game recorder in recording mode, just remember to turn it off in the transition from menu to game mode. Although the gameplay can be recorded and it looks fine while playing, there is a problem with the recorded video; it's jittery. Haven't found a fix for it yet. Note that frame rate is capped at 33 fps.End of updateMoto Racer Anniversary Edition has no replay view but Moto Racer 3 does. It has some semblance of realism but it's mostly arcadey physics which is to be expected. The key is to play at the proper resolution and setting so that it's not too fast, otherwise bike control would be too twitchy on the keyboard.Steam has a very good offer at 80% off at the moment but here is a better offer: https://www.bundlestars.com/en/bundle/microids-mega-bundle-30th-anniversaryNo i'm not paid to recommend Bundle Stars deal, i'm just sharing info in case you're interested.It's quite fun and way cheaper than MotoGP series. You have the option to race on the road with traffic which is absent in MotoGP and Ride. I assume it would have better compatibility with older systems.6.5/10Minor update March 20, 2017For some reason Moto Racer 3 no longer works. I suspect this has to do with the latest AMD driver Non-WHQL Crimson 16.2.1 driver package or some Windows updates that was recently installed. Will update again later if i can fix it.Minor update March 31 2017It works again, just as i thought. Older AMD driver version 8.951.0.0 which comes with the catalyst app 12.3 is compatible. Still jittery in the recorded gameplay though.Minor update April 2 2017Found a fix for the jittery recorded video - Use FRAPS. Hah! it's that simple, to think that i spent so much time fiddling with graphics settings, different drivers and encoding methods. Here is the result:


YouTube™ Video: Moto Racer 3 - Eastern Creek, gameplay & replay 

			Views: 3		

			Easy AI wasn't so easy for me, i had an easier time with SBK and MotoGP series. Physics is ok, it's not too arcadey and the bike banking is more responsive than other bike games.		

Before i forget; Moto Racer 3 works offline without Steam, not sure about the rest.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Moto Racer games were a staple of my childhood. The CD for the first game is probably still at my parent's house somewhere. And the games themselves are still reasonably fun, if not very dated.But this collection is abysmal. It's honestly amazing how lazy this collection is. First, there's the launcher. The launcher is the laziest part of this collection. It was very obviously made with Windows forms (So I doubt we'll ever see a Mac or Linux port of this), and was made by someone who spent maybe 15 minutes on it. It's just a drop-down menu that lets you pick a game, and sometimes the language. They didn't even change the default icon for goodness' sake! In an hour, I could teach a programmer how to make a better launcher than this...But let's talk about the games. But with the first Moto Racer, the launcher won't even launch the game! If you go into the installation directory and launche the game there, it will work. But besides the issues with launching the game, it has not been changed. It's just as good as I remember it, but it's controller support has not been updated for modern controllers. Running it with an Xbox 360 controller, the turns are way too fast. You can get used to it, though.Moto Racer 2 does not allow turning with anything other than a controller for me (Which has aforementioned sensitivity issues). This game is a marked improvment over the first though, even if it's not been changed since it was released. Moto Racer 3 is the first one so far to run without any issues! It's not as good as Moto Racer 1 or 2 though. Moto Racer: 15th Anniversary is...there's no way to put this lightly, the worst in the series. It's a port of a mobile game, and it shows: Poor production values; bland and uninspired graphics; and very, very bad AI. There's nothing really enjoyable here. In all, this is a poor collection of great games. If you want to experience the Moto Racer games, just get them from GOG. If this collection ever gets updated to be less abysmal, I will update this review.			",374,96,6,47,22,2,51

												Not worth your money. Moto Racer and Moto Racer 2 won't even start due to Windows thinking that they need something called ""DirectPlay"" then not even being able to find it. Moto Racer 3 has some menu issues that make it unplayable. The other one is alright, although it seems like it could easily be a browser game.

Otherwise, don't get it here, gog.com has a better port.And as it turned out, the first two sequels were pretty okay.

												Moto Racer (1) crashes as soon as it starts on my x86 laptop.Moto Racer 2 apparently lets you play up to 4 players at a time, either via the same PC, or through LAN. When playing with the AI, you need to be very mindful about what difficulty you're playing on, and if you're playing on Arcade or Simulation mode. It's fun to race around at the different tracks in the game, and it even lets you make your own tracks, though if you make the corners too tight, it won't let you race in it.Moto Racer 3 and Moto Racer 15th Anniversary Edition is boring and bland.Don't buy this compilation, not even on a sale, like I did			",98,1,6,10,3,0,2

												MR 2 and 3 both generally work on my system (no sound problems or obvious glitches) but:MR 2 - XBox 360 controller works good for me, but it's impossible to catch up with the leading few Easy AI riders (at least on a dirt bike). I re-raced the track like 10 times, eventually well enough to compete with what should be Hard mode, and I still couldn't place higher than 5th in the race. The others were gone from the start, never to be seen again, as if their bikes are faster than the player's and they make no mistakes whatsoever.MR 3 - XBox 360 controller doesn't work. At all. The launcher detects the buttons when I re-map them, but in the game the controller does nothing.It shows that they threw this thing together quickly.			",49,16,7,20,53,5,16

												It's a scam to even try to sell this here. The cult classics - MR 1 and 2, don't even start - you cannot even get to the menu.It's a shame Steam allows this sort of thing on the store.			",546,285,26,69,45,4,63
