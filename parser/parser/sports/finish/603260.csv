												The Cat Games is a great game for cat lovers, it is really fun and helps you learn new cat breeds and is a good game to play when you just want to waste some time waiting for something. (Not in a bad way it won't be a waste)			",72,7,2,7,5,0,6

												It's quite clear when someone is just obsessed with cats in general vs someone who actually allows a cat to own them and knows how cats really are irl. The guy who made this game knows. Oh, he knows.I am currently owned by 3 cats and this guy captured all of their supreme adorable idiocy in one game.Loved it 10/10			",177,51,3,8,12,0,19

												This game is so nice and relaxing. The perfect balance of cute and silly to brighten anyone's day. I finished the game and completed all the achievements in a little over and hour and a half, but I can definitely see myself coming back to this when I need my cat fix. Definitely worth a couple bucks IMO			",104,22,0,6,4,1,18

												This is basically a simple game with 3 main mini game mode: racing, swim & billiard✔ plus bird-catching, cat-napping bug-catching, balloon-popping & pc hacking (it's secret!)✔ Purrfectly made, purrty easy to play & understand✔ Wonfurful simple graphic: furry cute cats✔ Pawesome sound: purr, meow & well picked mewsic from Legendary meowsician ❌ The only downside is the control that is only by mouse, feels weird in racing, but no big deal because I had my workaround: just pick the mouse, turn it 90°CW and use it like a game controller, now left button is up and right button is downHow much I like this game score: 9.5/10 - Love itHow much I want to recommend this game score: 10/10 - for every cat person.

												So cute! Definitely for the cat lover, so simple yet adorable. Has 3 mini games and is just overall a good unwind game.  It has an English version as well as Simplified Chinese, but doesn't support other languages (yet?).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a very simple game, consisting of a handful of minigames and a few obtuse puzzles. But darn it, the game is just too cute to not enjoy ^_^ And it's only a couple of bucks so you're not out by much.			",311,114,1,60,14,2,12

												This is a simple game and you could argue if it is worth any money because it's definitely comparable to (free) online flash games. The game has 3 main minigames where you avoid furniture by going up and down using the left and right mouse button collecting as many points in the process possible.The other game has you 'fighting' for your 'life' in the bathroom. A series of washing/bathroom related stuff get thrown at you and you have to get rid of them before they hit you and knock you in the tub, you won't get any points for knocking stuff away except for the objects that jump out of the tub.And finally we have Cat Trivia Billiards where you play a simple game of billiards where you're shown a certain cat race and have to get rid of that one for maximum points (the balls have cat heads on them).Besides that you have a dream sequence where you can connect 3 symbols and get an achievement, you can also catch birds outside and figure out a password for some more achievements.The game can be completed in 10 minutes if you don't care about achievements and play it slowly...So is it worth it? Not really but complaining for spending 2 bucks isn't worth it either so enjoy it if you have it and try to get the most out of it, or ask for a refund when you've completed everything.Extra: one of my cats liked this game 'tho, the sounds got her looking at my screen and she tried to catch some of the stuff that appeared so it certainly is a cat game...

												""The Cat Games"" caught my eye because I simply really love cats.  I knew I had to at least try it!  The three main games are really imaginitive for how deceivingly simple they seem, and there's some definitely replayability there. 


YouTube™ Video: THE CAT GAMES! 

			Views: 371		

			Ladies and Gentlemen.... Welcome to The Cat Games gameplay by Mojito Mojo! The Cat Games isn't a game with a cat; it's a game about cats!		

I think the thing I enjoyed most about The Cat Games is the level of cat humor put into the game.  There's little additions here and there that, if you're paying attention and see them, will definitely get a great chuckle out of you.  For example, make sure you check out the ""Settings"" menu,  even if you're a ""default"" settings kind of guy/gal.I guess the end of the line with a game review comes down to this:  Is the game fun to play?  Personally, I had a lot of fun and many laughs playing The Cat Games!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Cute selection of mini games, possible to get all of the achivements in an hour I should think.It's good for the price, controls slightly wonky on a mousepad, idk if using a mouse would make all that much difference though. It is family friendly, I could see younger kids really enjoying this, for adults it's ok as a little break it's funny, but not challenging.If you're looking to procrastinate, and like cats then this is the perfect game.
