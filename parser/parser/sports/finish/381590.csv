												Seems a bit glitchy, not an awesome steering control if you compare to the Trials games. Seems a bit pricey even on 10% off. I don't like the menus either.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game for the price! Once you've mastered the controls, there's hours of fun to be had. If you're an MTBer give it a go.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
