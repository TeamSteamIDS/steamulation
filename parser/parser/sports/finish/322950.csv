												Good:+++ Full controller support++ Good looking++ Nice, chilled musicNeutral:~ Offers in-game purchases for card styles, chips and more~ 10 achievements in under 1hBad:- - - High retail price for what is offered- -  AI is not great- - Very little features beside the core game- No way to interact with the players, not even a chat- Purchasing process for In-game purchases is broken- No ""look at played hands"" featureIn conclusion:If you want to play poker with a mouse and don't need the 3D graphics, there are better options for free with more features. I guess the game is all right, if want to sit on the couch with a controller and play just some  hands of poker alone... Wait till a sale comes around. 8-12€ would be okay price for it.

												Texas oops I ment to say Pure Hold'em is a poker game, yea figure it out...There was me last night entering a game for first time, lights were off, AC was on, light smell of ciggaret I smoked few minutes before, with game atmosphere gave me feeling like I was in reall casino... no bs.Let's go with pros and cons now:PROS:+ Graphic is awesome+ Music chilled casino style+ Gameplay:Tournaments, sit 'n go, leaderboards, smart AI, playing offline mode you earn money to play online, high/low with reset on 24h, achievements, lots of tables splited by buy-in. Beatiful card designs, with option to buy even more(for ones with deep pockets)CONS:- Camera, when cards are dealing I cant wait to get my cards to look at them, because my player from his own reasons is just wandering around the tabe, and it makes me dizzy after short period of time.- Impossible interaction with other players, because there is no chat whatsoever, devs please implement it in next update Overall:It is beautiful poker game, best there is for PC platform, just need little finishing touch, like puting a chat in it ^^If you are in poker like me, hell I have over 5000 hours on FB Texas Hold'em, you will love this game.Il give it a score for now 7/10 because I really find that chat in poker game is of crutial importance.

												A fairly attractive Hold 'em implementation - but lack of an online community really sinks this game for me.  If I'm going to play Texas Hold 'em vs. AI opponents, then I will play Poker Night 2.			",39,18,0,32,26,2,48

												Wow what a terrible game.  Can only play against the AI, not against humans.  That wouldn't be so bad, except the AI is awful at poker.  I mean really awful.  For example, the AI telegraphs the strength of their hand by their bet sizing.  Also, donk leads into you after you were the preflop aggressor mean either top or middle pair every time, so you can either bluff raise on overcards or fold if you have no equity.  Overall, it's just a bs cash grab imo.  I've played a ton of poker in my day and this is hands down the computer worst poker experience i've had.			",22,7,0,11,1,2,14

												This so doesn't worth the price tag. It actually should be F2P. Really. Bought it during Christmas sales, and even then was surprised how terrible it is. I had more fun with Poker Night at the Inventory and Poker Night 2, not to mention the F2P The Four Kings Casino and Slots.There is no need to tell you about the negatives about chat or lobby or that you have to buy chips with real money. And I don't mean chips like skins or anything like that, which is also the case, I mean CHIPS TO PLAY WITH. What the f?Did I also mention that the freaking camera is also nauseating? Also why can't I keep my cards always visible to me? That's just stupid.Shame. Real shame.			",82,20,11,7,18,2,11

The online play is fun and its great to pit your wits against other people, as well as AI if you fancy it, even if you don't have any money lol. Would deefinately recommend for both hard core hold 'em fans and novices who want to have a go. Highly recommended!			",15,1,0,1,3,0,4

												From the makers of my favorite Steam Pool game (Pure Pool), comes Pure Hold 'em. If you love poker, I think you'll like this game.Graphics/Eye Candy-Best I've seen in a poker gameMusic-Top Notch with many styles or can be set to shuffle all of themA.I.-Good I guess, Debatable really, from what I've played all of teh A.I. players have their styles, some are Fish, some only play teh nuts, and inbetween there also.Best Poker Game I've played on Steam-Yes, Hands downThe whole atmosphere really sets teh tone, as it did with Pure Pool, not enough can be said how VooFoo studios can suck you into a game.I do recommend this game, I haven't had to deal with any microtransaction some are down rating for, I'm sure if I go bust that time will come, but I don't have too much of a problem with it, you can earn chips by levelling up, so that is good, plus yuour table winnings if you come out ahead.I say give it a try, if ypu don't care for it, get a refund, but I hope for many players that way we can have some good multiplayer games.

												This is a great poker game, the graphics are great and I love the table and card options. I have the game both on the PS4 and on Steam (albeit I have played the PS4 version more) There are different tournaments with different buy in fees from a bar to a penthouse you can bluff your way to being a rich trillionare. There is a daily game of high and low which you can play to win chips, bank anytime or try to get the max amount if you are good enough, you also get chips by levelling up or you can buy chips via DLC.Defo the best poker game I have played, and because it is all virtual chips, I still have a house and a wife. :D Win win.
