								I have never gotten into this franchise but my wife asked if this was available for Vr a few weeks ago. I just saw it pop up on the Vive Subreddit (great community there btw) and purchased it to suprise her. So far...she hasn't had a turn. Obviously....I had to test it first! It was much more fun playing than I ever thought it would have been. Not sure if it has to do with VR but I had a blast. Then I discovered the Arcade mode...thats even better!! I hear that the devs are going to put additional features, some new to the franchise for VR and that might add some additional value for the veterns. It runs great as well (using gtx 970). Be carefull though, I just broke my first wrist strap on my ceiling fan. Edited because I before E except after C...thanks phxrockerUpdate 8/4/2016: They just released a Survival mode and it so much fun! It is pretty hard as well. This is very different from any other version of Fruit Ninja and these little Helecopter baskets with a mounted cannon shoot fruit at you. Eventually, if you survive, more and more show up. The fun is when the bombs start shooting at you as well. Those you have to duck and dodge. Really fun and so worth the price!			",120,28,1,9,13,1,1

								Full Review: http://uploadvr.com/fruit-ninja-vr-htc-vive-early-access-review/Summary:While Fruit Ninja VR is incredibly addicting, easy to jump into for newcomers, and tons of fun to play in its own right, it does feel a bit shallow in its current state. You can expect it to grow significantly over time considering it already has a strong foundation. Halfbrick Studios have proven that Fruit Ninja VR is the prime example of how to take a simple concept and adapt it to the uniquely immersive medium of virtual reality.Pros:- Incredibly addicting- Fun, varied game modes- New mechanics like stabbing- Bright and colorful visualsCons:- Feels a bit shallow on content- Sometimes the physics feel offFinal Score: 8/10 - GREATNote: UploadVR uses multiple Steam accounts across multiple editors and locations. Hours logged do not necessarily reflect all time spent in the game.			",87,35,4,1,15,5,4

								Kinda neutral on this one - I didn't hate it, but I didn't exactly love it either. My wife had a lot of fun when she realised that she could skewer the fruit instead of just slicing it, and I had some fun messing around with the physics throwing fruit up in the air trying to catch it in my mouth (I do not recommend trying this with Watermelons in real life), but otherwise it plays pretty much exactly the same as the mobile version - just in VR.One disadvantage of this version over the mobile version is that the limited FOV in current generation headsets means you often won't see the fruit fly up on your sides (I figured out a trick though - keep an eye on the shadows).It has the same game modes as the mobile version - Zen (no bombs), Classic (slow paced) and Arcade (fast paced), but I would have really liked some more content since PC > mobile (like the various sword fighting games in Wii Sports & Wii Sports Resort)... but I can't fault it for delivering exactly what it promised on the tin.

								Fruit Ninja in VR!Remember Fruit Ninja Kinect? It was difficult to see where your cuts go on a 2D screen. Besides, you are only cutting fruits on a 2D plane.Fruit Ninja VR is another interesting take in the series. This is the closest thing to cutting fruits for real.Both controllers are swords, but you can use one and leave the other on the floor or on a table. It feels more badass to wield a sword two handed.I wish they add all the modes in FN Kinect to FN VR!PS: I feel sorry for ZenBlade now...			",235,41,8,19,29,3,18

												It's Fruit Ninja!  IN VR! How cool is that?Honestly.. not very.The reason this was fun on the phone (that we played probably mostly while our wives shop or while bored on the toilet) was that it was fun for about 5 minutes at a time and it was kind of challenging.  Sort of.Well, that just doesn't translate very well to a full-fledged game where you're literally a captive audience since you went and put on all your VR stuff.  You literally get bored with this faster than it took to unplug your remotes, wipe your vr lenses, plug in your headset, unwind your cords and actually start the game.Not a good choice unless you're just a big, big fan of pointless arm swinging.  This entire experience is little more than waving your hands left and right quickly.  Literally.  That's it.  Oh, sorry you can ""skewer"" fruit.  Because, that's fun I guess?Well, beyond boredom, there are some other issues:The area you're in is low-poly and pointless (you can't interact with anything nor move)The machines that shoot the fruit in certain game modes are pointless and distractingThe tubes that shoot up fruit are too widely spaced for the FoV on the VR headset, so prepare for some nausea-inducing left and right head swinging for the entire game.Don't buy this unless it's DEEPLY discounted.  There's literally nothing more to this game than swinging your arms left and right.			",2063,794,71,240,256,21,325

								Very good addition to the VR catalog. I find this game kind of funny... At least 7 years years I remember this game being ""cutting edge"" technology on mobile. Now some time later I am playing that same game in VR feeling the same thing. I have a lot of hours into Zenblade and I am not here to compare the two games. I am here to say they are both very different for being the same kind of game. Fruit Ninja VR allows certain liberties like being able to cut Fruit with the back end of the blade and cross blades without collision. Very enjoyable game with much replay value. It will be a must on the demo list when people come over to try VR for the 1rst time. Here is my Sword Setup for any game Sword related. Having the grip and ability to two hand is pretty awesome!http://i.imgur.com/lG3TyuR.jpg ",256,63,8,11,45,4,7

								This game obviously does not have much depth. Sure you have played it, and know what I mean. But please don't let that stop you buying it. It's is worth it, just to hear your swords swoosh about. I can't help myself at the end of each round but to do a little samurai of the dancing swords. Grab yourself some wii straps as I'm sure if straps are going to break it will be this game. Need the fruit to be smoother and this game will be ""A"" grade. Also I'm sure there could be another angle on this game being VR. Come Devs think outside the square 👊 Maybe fruit coming at you, and if it hits you splats on your screen? Like I said I'm sure there is another angle. Vr boysUpdate- the just released survival mode is top notch. I absolutely love this. This is vr thinking. You guys have done a great job. Now I'm greedy for more. If you didn't buy it before it's a must have for your vr collection now!!!			",101,40,5,4,28,3,17

								Very nice adaptation of the famous mobile app. This VR game feels really responsive and well made. My family and I had tons of fun competening with each other! The four game modes are quite good (my personal favorite is Arcade because of the rythm). On the negative side, the game lacks content. While I understand that the leaderboard is the main rationale to beat the best score, I feel like there is not much to do beside that. This game needs more content as in the mobile app: more blades, more backgrounds with bonuses, more challenges etc. Overall a good VR game tho. On the VR scale of rating: 78/100			",144,20,4,15,14,2,15

								I am writing this review from inside of my iphone. I don't know how I got in here... But its absolutely incredible! Fruit Ninja VR is a must have game for the Vive, just as Fruit Ninja was a must have app for any smartphone owner! Halfbrick really found a great way to take an old franchise, and put it into a whole new light! Fruit Ninja has officially been...Re""Vive""d!The moment you put on your headset, you are greeted with three different gamemode options, all included in the original smartphone game. The first mode is Arcade. This mode has you going up against the clock to see how many points you can earn within a one minute time frame. Combos and bonuses are your friend here, so be sure to rack up as many as you can. All bombs must be avoided, as slicing one would result in an instant ""Game Over!""The second mode is Classic. Here you must slice as many fruit as you can while attempting to avoid the oncoming bombs. Failing to slice a fruit that you are presented with before it hits the ground will earn you a strike. Three of these, and ""Your out!"" The goal in this mode is to gain as many points as possible within an infinite amount of time. The third and final mode is Zen. While very similar to Arcade mode, it does have its differences. There are zero bombs in this mode, and your main focus is slicing fruit and earning combos. There is also a time limit that you are up against. You have 90 seconds to slice, dice, and cut as many of those fruits that you possibly can.I personally find all three of these modes to give an equal amount of enjoyment. The leaderboards for each gamemode are one of the greatest aspects of this game. Attempting to go for the communities high score is very addictive and a ton of fun!  Graphically this game is gorgeous! The animated cartoony style looks and feels really cool in VR! The swords are shiny and reflective, the background is visually pleasing, and all the small elements of this game are very detailed and polished.All of the sound effects in this game are actually pretty nostalgic. Many of them are taken straight from the original game, and it fits so perfectly in this one.The controls of this game are so simple, that if you have arms, you can play. Slicing is the only required movement in this game, and there is not a single button that you must press to activate anything! Not only are the controls simple, but they are very intuitive. There have been no occurrences of any missed fruit slicing or bomb hits that have not been my own fault. Don't mistake having the fruit or bomb bounce off your sword as a glitch. You must slice them, not just let your sword touch them. The swords move around beautifully, and even make a swooshing sound when you swing them. If the amount of content is what's holding you back from buying this game, don't fret. Its still incredible at its current state + Multiplayer, new maps, and new weapons are on the way. This game is still in early access. The next generation of ninja fruit slicing is here...And its wonderful!			",32,24,4,0,25,4,2

Mechanics are really fluid and simple. Exactly what good games are made of, great mechanics, gret style and gameplay that's both very acvcessible but also pretty hard to master if it gets you hooked.

								9/10Reasoning:Most of the negative reviews for this game say ""Shallow in content""; my response to that is:IT IS FRUIT NINJA!!!This game is just like the app that many of us used to play a few years ago, or even continue to play, the only difference being it is better. It includes new mechanics such as making a 'shishkebab' out of fruit, or pushing bombs aside... you feel like a real fruit ninja...My reasoning behind not giving it a  10/10 even though I am praising it so much is the simple fact that the sensitivity could be better... That's it. Sometime, very occasionally you try pushing a bomb and even though you are going slow, it explodes, or you try stabbing it and it just pushes it, that is all that I can say really, thank you for reading, enjoy your day!

I mentioned something i noticed about an occasional slicing issue, and they responded quickly letting me know they were working on it. If you ever enjoyed fruit ninja on your phone, you're going to love it in vr. It is rewarding, the environment is awsome, the effects are well done, physics feel right, the fruit looks so awsome all cut up on the floor. I can't help but recommend this game if you think you would enjoy slicing up fruit without worrying about cleaning the mess.			",141,8,2,9,12,4,16

Acevenment, as soon as possible.When you have bought the game, that is the easiest time to do this achevement.Achevement is done by failing with same score as your personal best.Just slice a fruit to get a point, wait for end of round, and retry and slice the same fruit and wait for the end.I did not do it at start, but I mannagd to do it in the Survival, since I did not have a insane high score there			",518,117,16,66,52,4,89

								As quick and fun Vive VR games go, this one is surprisingly hard to beat. There's really not all that much here. Simple graphics, no story, no real room-scale capitalization. But it is just. So. Fun.Really easy to pick up. This is basically the first ""game"" I present to VR new-comers. But I just keep coming back to it myself.tl;dr If you buy one VR game, buy this.

								Ridiculously fun! It's definitely a workout. Prepare towels on the side for all the sweating. There's not much in terms of content, but that's just what fruit ninja is, and for the price it's fine. In terms of VR sickness there is none, it was very comfortable. This is definitely something you can show your friends who haven't tried VR.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								For those of you wondering if this game is better than ZenBlade, I'd say yes, it kinda is.  I had really liked Zenblade, and when I saw this coming out I didn't think it would be any good.  But the reviews made me want to give it a shot.  Zenblade is more ""realistic"" in that you must use the blade to make cuts, where fruit Ninja is more forgiving.  This game also, allows more misses per level and has much moe eye candy.			",138,47,5,13,35,6,9

								It's exactly what it says it is: Fruit Ninja. This is a very faithful recreation of the game in VR and it's quite stable, though the features are still minimal as yet. I'm very satisfied with it; it's exactly what I wanted it to be.Be warned that in this early state performance might not be up to par for you. I have a GTX 1080 and I still got some pretty bad slowdown during the most intense parts. Granted, there's currently an issue with the 1080's boost clock in VR that will be fixed later this week, but someone with an RX 480 or similar might suffer.			",171,11,2,20,9,0,17

								I bought this game thinking it was going to be a gimic of a game , however on launch I found it to be quite the opposite. Just slicing a piece of fruit made you feel like a pro ninja.  I found it to be lag free and the effects look good. The fruit is cut in the exact way you cut it which is a great touch.			",121,16,2,4,41,3,34

								A lot more colorful than ZenBlade, and the Aesthetic is overall more pleasant. There are also more modes than Zenblade.I tried it normally, and it was pretty fun. I'd give it a 7/10 with 2 normal controllers.I also tried it with my controller attatched to a foam Nerf sword, which made it easy to do two-handed on one sword, and gave a lot more weight to it. I'd give it a 8.5/10 with the foam sword.Don't get this if you already have ZenBlade because it's pretty much the same game, but if you are deciding between this and Zen, this is way better.

It feels like only the front half of the blade exists. I want to feel the whole blade when I slide the fruit peices off of my platform.-Needs more haptic feedback. The thing that struck me right away in Zenblade was hitting the floor with the sword. Because of that feedback, I was easily able to get a feel for how long the blade is.If Fruit Ninja VR added these things, It would instantly be the perfect game to me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Fruit ninja has long been the only mobile game I still keep on my phone so I'm extremely excited now to see it entering the realm of VR! An excellent start to development so far. Feels great. Can't wait to see it catch up to the phone versions in terms of depth. Would love to see that leveling system, the festival games and bosses and most definitely can't wait for unlockable blades and backgrounds to appeal to the collector Ninja within me. I don't know if halfbrick are planning any of this but I sincerely hope so. Excited to see how development goes.			",100,29,5,12,13,1,21

								I wasn't a big fan of the Fruit Ninja video game, however, the VR version is lots of fun. It's much more immersive when you are actually in the game holding the swords. I do find that the game gets too difficult too quickly. You should make the levels a little easier so there is more room for progression. It is very difficult to even get past the first few levels without hitting a bomb. Regardless, great graphics and fun game play. A fun way to kill some time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Yup, it's Fruit Ninja alright, just like I remember it from my phone. Perfectly executed too. I feel just like I'm playing it on my phone. And that's the problem, it was free on my phone, here it's over $10. If they added something more, I'd easily pay that, but as it is I can't imagine paying that much for it. I actually wouldn't have a problem with them making it free to play like on the phone app.So why am I giving it a thumbs up? Because of Steam's excellent return policy. I played for 12 minutes and now I'm returning it. I'll put it on my wishlist and get it again when they add something more.P.S. stabbing fruit was cool for about 10 seconds.			",38,10,6,3,12,2,1

								Yes I like fruit ninja the best in VR. However I bought the mobile game as well as the kinnect version over the years and I was really hoping to get a new experience. Say a boss fight with a fruit and bomb throwing monster ninja of some kind. That would be a cool dynamic of dodge,  parry, and attack.			",74,7,1,0,8,2,2

								I haven't had this much fun slicing fruit since I got a little carried away in cooking class (which, incidentally, may or may not be why I never seemed to manage to finish that course) - fortunately virtual fruit is much easier to clean up than real fruit.There might not be a lot of content in Fruit Ninja VR yet, but it's tons of fun. Get it. You won't regret it. Until you get a little carried away and nearly destroy your TV. Which I, err... didn't do... no, of course not.			",804,221,45,96,95,16,133

								Not nearly polished enough, the physics are horrible. Don't even have to hit the fruit with the sharp side of the blade, no vibrations on hit, and you can just swing your arms around to get high scores. It's extremely short; no real point to play has no progression. It has less than nvidia's free vr arcade, and the physics are much much worse. For $15, you are getting ripped off.Even the positive reviews don't have more than about an hour or 2 of gameplay.Only worth about $1 to $2. (I believe in the dollar an hour price comparator, and this game is x7.5 - x15 over it's price)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I would recommend Zen Blade over the official Fruit Ninja game simply becuse in Fruit Ninja you can just wave your sword around like you're trying to shoo flies away and you still chop the fruit. It lacks the realism of Zenn Blade. In Zen Blade, you must turn the sharp side of the swored to the object you're cuting ot it will just bound off. You can use this as a stategy to bounce away bombs as well. I think this makes the game more challenging and fun.			",49,30,0,4,11,2,3

												Not recommended at all. Looks very polished so good job there but there is very little gameplay (less than the original it feels like) and the mechanics just don't work that well. Generally the difficulty levels are unfun and players get overwhelmed too quickly. I had everyone in our office have a go at all our VR games over the holiday and this was skipped pretty quick. I don't write many reviews but this should be a pass for VR fans. In general these VR titles are overpriced for what they offer and it this is a great example of that. $5-10 game at most.

												This might be a fun game for children, but it is not a fully fleshed out game in any way.  You can ""slice"" the fruit in half with the flat of your blade (simply impossible with a ""real"" sword unless you are baseball-bating it) or the back of your blade.Additionally, it doesn't really have much to add beyond what you get for the free phone game.While I've never returned a game before, this one is getting refunded.  It is DEFINITELY NOT in any way shape or form a $15 game.  If it was $5, I'd keep it...but this is not worth it at all to me (and I've kept terrible VR games just to further the the VR market).  This game is just overpriced for what they are trying to sell it for and they are just trying to cash in on the name recognition from the mobile phone game.  I'm going to wait for Zen Blad to come back which seems like a much better game from what I have been able to read.			",81,15,2,4,10,1,4

								I never played any of the Fruit Ninja games before.  I've seen people on the metro playing it on their cell phones and always thought it was dumb.  I have to admit though that in VR this game is freaking great.  It's a really stupid simple game where you just stand there and slice stuff but I was shocked at how satisfying it really is!  Now this game was gifted to me by a friend but I would totally buy it again the next time it goes on sale.  I'm not a super big fan of the $15 price tag.  Anyway, check out the video for some real gameplay footage.

												A very clean rebuild of the original Fruit Ninja. Adds in VR specific components, like flicking bombs away with the blunt side of the blade, and a new Survival mode where fruit drones shoot at you from various angles. Over all, a very solid game, exactly what you would expect it to be, and an obvious game to purchase if you have a Vive/Oculus.			",65,4,0,5,6,3,3

								If you like Zen Blade, you will like this. If you like this, you will like Zen Blade. Just get both since they're both equally good yet slightly different from eachother.If you ever saw that one Mythbusters episode regarding this, this is your one stop place to go to have the same experience yourself. It's mindless fun and is stupid simple to get into. My only complaint is that, unlike Zen Blade, you always have two swords. I don't know, I like having the option of just one sword or two. I have never played the mobile versions, but I have played the VR and Kienct versions and all I can say is they're a complete blast to play.Also, if you want to try it and don't have a Vive, but have an Xbox with a Kinect, play Fruit Ninja for the Kinect. Just as fun, and no I'm not sponsored. I get VR is still pricey and people are always wanting to try newer things, so I'm just throwing this out there as an alternative.tl;dr: This should be in every Vive/Oculus owner's library and makes for a great initial experience.

								So let me start with saying I really like this game.  I've never played the app Fruit Ninja so I don't know why I really wanted this game in the first place.  That being said, I'm not sure the game is worth $15 for what it is.  I'm hoping there will be some improvements like multiple fruit slashing, more rounds, different types of rounds, etc.  Anyway, if you have an extra $15 to spare, I'd buy the game because it's really entertaining.  If you're on a budget, I wouldn't buy the game in it's current state or I'd wait for it to go on sale.			",14,24,1,0,8,1,0

								This is my favorite VR game by far!  The physics are realistic enough to feel satisfying and fake in a way that makes you feel stronger and more talented than you would be in real life.  The katanas feel very light and with the flick of your wrist you can slice a coconut in half or send a bomb flying up in the air.  The stereo audio is pretty well done and offers enough cues so that you know when a piece of fruit pops up outside of your range of vision.  I think they've squeezed as much technology into this game as possible making it one of the richest vr experiences I've seen so far.  And the music is great too.  I would recommend playing in a large play area if possible. I'm not sure how good the game is in a cramped space.			",25,5,0,4,13,3,0

								I had a mild addiction to Fruit Ninja on Android some years back, and are very familiar with the concept and game modes.What can I say, they did it again. The very simplistic concept which worked wonders on the fairly new smartphone touchscreens, applies to the freedom of VR just as well.It's the same game, with better and way more fun controls! The game modes are still very addictive, and the new ""Survival mode"", where flyinf robots shoots barrages of fruit at you, gives a little more depth, allthough it feels a little gimmicky.Can't get enough of Classic and Zen mode! Arcade hurts my arms and shoulders xDA must-have for Fruit, Sword and/or VR fans!!			",59,15,5,11,10,2,6

								Nice colorful graphics and a good workout, It's exactly what you would expect and very well executed. Only real downside is that this is one of those games that makes you want more field of view in the headset.			",104,38,2,20,20,0,10

								I never played any of the Fruit Ninja games before.  I've seen people on the metro playing it on their cell phones and always thought it was dumb.  I have to admit though that in VR this game is freaking great.  It's a really stupid simple game where you just stand there and slice stuff but I was shocked at how satisfying it really is!  Now this game was gifted to me by a friend but I would totally buy it again the next time it goes on sale.  I'm not a super big fan of the $15 price tag.  Anyway, check out the video for some real gameplay footage.

								Loving it. Nice graphics style, smooth gameplay. Great sword/slice mechanics although the physics aren't ultra realistic.The game often requires quick reactions and precise controller swinging. Random waving will get you nowhere.Your own skill improvement over time is visible on scoreboards.The fun is what counts. And this game delivers fun every time I play it.However it's exhausting and easily makes you sweat. (but not as much as Holopoint)			",385,76,22,26,37,2,54

								So let me start with saying I really like this game.  I've never played the app Fruit Ninja so I don't know why I really wanted this game in the first place.  That being said, I'm not sure the game is worth $15 for what it is.  I'm hoping there will be some improvements like multiple fruit slashing, more rounds, different types of rounds, etc.  Anyway, if you have an extra $15 to spare, I'd buy the game because it's really entertaining.  If you're on a budget, I wouldn't buy the game in it's current state or I'd wait for it to go on sale.			",14,24,1,0,8,1,0
