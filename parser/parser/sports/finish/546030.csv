												So much potential here.  Got the game on sale for $5 and I feel that is acceptable for only three levels.  I hope there will be more levels or game modes added soon!			",93,37,4,10,28,2,7

												3 levels for $9.99? Great concept but really should be a demo for $9.99. More gem shape combinations and special combos generating special gems would be a great enhancement.Not worth the money.			",14,11,0,2,7,1,6

												Fun game, don't get me wrong. But I can't recommend it at this price point. There are only 3 levels... After level 3 it just takes you back to the beginning. Each level is quite short as well. Evolution VR is free and has more content than this. The price for this game should not exceed $5 with this amount of content in my humble opinion.My video on the game:

			This new gem matching puzzle game is the first of its kind that I've played on the Vive. Content is rather shallow but it's still pretty fun!
