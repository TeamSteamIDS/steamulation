												The game is not so bad, but it has to many bugs on my system... Controller issues (xbox360 wireless) which I can only manage by 3rd party software.Many Achies are confused, I hope not broken... ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is my THIRD update to this review on [Los] Minidrivers, so here we go.The physics are out wack, many times I've lost my front wing, and flipped over it, forcing me to restart, speaking of restarting, I can't think of a race I've not needed to restart.After a race a Spa [Eau Rouge looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥by the way] Which I won, It showed I lost, forcing me to do the race again.In the grandstands are only cardboard cutouts with flat faces, with the example here: 


The only ""Fans"" that showed up were some cardboard ones

Speaking of which, in the Minis the heads bop up and down, which should be easy to implement, At Sochi the Pit Lane is very short, it took me three laps to actually replace my front wing, and I saw the AI having the same problem, It needs to be longer.The weapons you get aren't varied from last to first, so in first you could get a energy drink [Mushroom] while in last you could get a oil [Banana] it should be the other way around to be fair and balanced.Again on the point of the AI winning if your not ahead of them after lap one, at Silverstone I was in third and for the life of me I couldn't close the gap, at all they won, so ridiculous.At Barcelona in the middle sector there is a middle bit that's red you can go through without penalty, it's overpowered and should be sealed.The ""Hot Race"" which is just a race at Sepang everyday never changes, never does the ""Achievement of the day"" it's always cross the line backwards. Such a basic idea, screwed up.Second Review Below.After buying (Los) Minidrivers again, I have seen that, indeed the creators asking for a good review for 5000 in-game currency, Which seems desperateAnyway, In the races i've seen, If a AI driver gets ahead of you, they will win, not matter what you do.The background is ALWAYS the same for EVERY track, Which is really embrassing to see. I assume (Los) Minibikers is the same,The powerups are mario-kart esque, if you'd played mario-kart EVER you'll know what they do, You need to BUY your way into the career mode, not joking, no F1 game ever, has done this, This is EA level of what the ♥♥♥♥.Simply if you enjoy (Los) Minidrivers on youtube, You may find some enjoy of this game, If not I find it hard for a casual to enjoy this at all.Previous review below.(OLD) Laggy, Unfinished, Minidrivers the game should be pulled untill the controls can be modified, Ditto for full screen. makes lag spikes less often and remove pay to win elements, I am a fan of (Los) Minidrivers on youtube, but this is garbage			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am sorry, but i cannot in good faith give this game a positive review or a recommendation. The controls are horrendous, it is laggy which should not be the case for such a simple game with less than average graphics. This one needs to go back into development and much polish added before it can even be considered playable.03/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
