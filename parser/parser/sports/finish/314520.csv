												Broken, lacking depth, arcade rubbish. The words that spring to mind having now played 8 hrs since launch. That the developers have labelled this a simulation and imagine it is worthy as a release candidate beggars belief. Pick one of 4 rig types that you are limited to carrying when you are fishing, pick one of four baits that you are limited to carrying and that's your terminal tackle sorted, seriously? Where do I adjust boilie buoyancy, hair length, my shock leader, and link length, pick hook type and size independent of the chosen rig. Where are the method feeders, carp poles, marker floats, bait boats, baiting sticks, feeder rods. Where are the oils for soaking boilie's, the pva stringers and bags, and the selection of groundbaits and particles for the spod rod. Why the hell are worms, luncheon meat, casters and maggots awol in a fishing game that features roach bream, tench and carp. Where is the window dressing such as alternate clothing, bivvies, bite alarms, landing nets, et al. Everything I would expect to see at launch from a title labelled an accurate simulation of European Fishing.Then there are the game mechanics that are present but not working correctly, even the basics such as fish control and landing glitch frequently, fish that run for 20 meters under the bank, line retrieval that bears no relationship to what I am actually doing or seeing, fish that become stuck under the tip of my rod, fish ai that is unaffected by wind direction, then there are the constant stream of bites, how I wish that fishing for carp and cats was so easy irl.I could go on but if you do not have a clear picture of this title yet, there is little point. It clearly has potential, graphically it looks good, but as a simulation of angling it stinks, as a release candidate it stinks, it is just not good enough; at best it is a shallow, broken, arcade game.

Cons:- The game looks pretty bad. They clearly spent a lot of time on their foliage, but for a game that's all about staring at water for hours on end, their water effects are absolutely terrible.- - There are no water physics at all. Even when you are reeling in a fish the water just remains static and boring.- - Even on Ultra the water doesn't reflect the sky or surroundings.- - You really can't see into the water. They don't have fish swimming around the bottom. They don't really have visible weeds or anything like that. It's just murky brown blandness.- Lack of variety. You are basically limited to several different types of carp, and one or two lakes also have catfish.- The net mechanic. It's awkward, it hurts the flow of the game, and I suspect the mechanic was mostly added to avoid needing physics for the fish.- There are no physics for the fish. You can't pull the fish out of the water with the rod while you're reeling it in. You never see the fish satisfyingly thrashing in the water, on the hook, or in your hands.- You can't get your line caught in a tree.Pros:- The casting physics are a fun novelty until the rest of the game ruins the experience for you.- It's cheaper than a fishing license. Also you don't need to go outside.The pictures and videos on the store page definitely make the game look better than it actually is. It's not the worst purchase I've ever made but I've already uninstalled it and probably won't ever be playing it again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								Ok, as a mature gamer and a UK course fisherman, i was intrigued the moment i saw this title. Mainly because it wasnt based on lure fishing for bass, which it seems 99% of fishing games are.  The first thing that struck me on playing it was the beautifull training lake, it was a while before i even cast a rod out as i was strolling round the lake in awe of the lush scenery. I struggled a bit at first with the fishing mechanics, but soon got used to it, and with practice it became very natural and pretty dam realistic. Im so glad i stuck with it for a couple of hours and got to grips with the controls, because now after several updates and much practice i am enjoying this game more than ever and would highly recommend it to anyone.The most impressive aspect of this project i feel, is the direction its heading in, although the updates arent super regular when the do hit they bring massive improvements and content. Phase 6 added a massive new lake, boss fish, landing net mechanics, a tackle shop and much more. All of the additions were well implemented and brought a lot more structure to the game. Unfortunatly i have now bought all the best tackle and saved up quite a bit of money for future tackle shop items. But the fact that its the first game i check everyday when im looking at whats been updated is testament to its genius. With the promise of Tench and float fishing equipment to come my mouth is watering!There are still some bugs of course as it is early access, but the devs are active enough and seem to be working on them. There is also online multiplyer now which works but is still very much in Alpha. I truly hope this gets the support and backing it deserves as it is, by far, the best fishing game ive ever played, already and theres still content to come. My advice to the devs on this one is please keep up the good work and keep heading in the direction your are... oh and hurry up with my Tench :POverall the good massively outweighs the bad and in my opinion is already a worthwile purchase.

Early Access Review
								[Early Access - Phase 5] UPDATEYES! You finally have a sense of freedom in freedom fishing. Game mechanics feel good, though I feel like now I'm throwing so far I might hit mountains the far distance. I liked the triple spinning wheel bug as well, sadly it is going to be fixed.[Early Access - Phase 3] UPDATEWhat I like:- Casting is a lot easier. I didn't find myself trying over and over again to get a goot shot like in phase 1, and I didn't have to move mymouse all across the table (mouse mat was sufficient :)).- Improved visuals. Some of the things that annoyed me about the first release was some basic but unrealistic/immersion breaking visuals like a rope-thick line and a very wobbly fishing pole. These have been fixed now, at least to some extent. The line is pretty good, or perfect in terms of thickness now and the pole has just about the right stiffness to it. I still experience motor-boating and pole glitches kind of often, but the basics are a lot better.- Character feedback. Another issue I had that has now been improved on is the characters feedback to the force of the fish and so on, when you are fishing. It is very pleasing, and I didn't find my self getting thrown off by the characters reactions this time - big +.- New features. The fish variations are great and I managed to catch a few during my testing of the game. Leader boards are great. Adds a lot more to the game and actually makes it worthwhile to play the game in its current state. I didn't manage to go too far up the rankings but it was a lot more fun and exciting to catch something and see how far it will get you.What I could see improved:- The fish AI. It was a lot better than first time I played, but I still experienced fish going from 10-80yds in a matter of seconds when fishing from some spots (especially the little closed spot without a lot of room, had issues). The fish also seemed to not care about swimming through landscape as I frequently saw fish going directly throw rocks/trees and sometimes into the land/road/path on the other side of the lake.- The force on the pole when having a hook is ok, but the line is not always acting accordingly. I frequently experienced a pole arced and bent like a bow, while the line acted as is if no force at all was being aplied to it.What I didn't like:- Reeling/catching fish seems to be bugged sometimes as I have found myself reeling in for a solid 10 minutes two times in a row at the same fishing spot without anything major happening to the yard indicator/other. I frequently feel like having no idea whats going on underneath the water. Like if I'm catching a fish and it's almost in reach (5-10ish)yds I'm just able to keep reeling in without anything happening. The line should be rather short at that point, but it feels like it's extended by 100 miles underneath the water. Also while reeling, at times when I was not able to pull the fish towards me (maybe extended the line underneath the water) I was still able to steer the fish to the left or right which makes no sense. While reeling I often wondered if the game had bugged out, if I was doing something totally wrong etc. Didn't feel very responsive. I think the latest updates have been good and have improved the game in areas where improvement were needed, but some fundamentals are still flawed. Pleased with this update :)-----------------------------------[Early Access - Phase 1] ORIGINALI understand the game is in early access, but I just think it is lacking in too many aspects, and I think the developers should have waited a bit before releasing it to the public and accepting your money.What you get to see in this early access is basically a few tutorials and trials, so you can get a feel for how the game and the mechanics are going to be implemented. This is fine, it is content-wise what they claimed it to be. I would be satisfied with this amount of content, if it wasn't because of the bare basics of the game not being very well implemented at all yet. For a dedicated fishing simulator, it doesn't do a very good job at simulating what real fishing feels like. On top of that the mechanics felt clunky, the visuals didn't feel right and the main point of the game (fishing) felt really awkward, unreal and unresponsive.Problems with the visuals:- The fishing line looks thicker than the pole itself, and I know it has to be easy to see on screen but there has to be a better way. The line also seems a lot heavier than an actual line (which is as light as a snowflake flowing in the wind), when you look at how it reacts with the physics currently in the game.- The fishing pole looks way too rubbery/elastic compared to a real pole. Very wobly :). Like if you shake your hand a bit, it might go all bananes.- The tension on the fishing line is the worst part about the visual issues. Very immersion breaking. When I have a fish on the line, the string tension is very unrealistic. It doesn't matter if the fish is 40 yards away or 10 yards, if I'm reeling in or being idle, the string looks all the same. I get no real feel for how far away the fish is, how hard it is pulling and so on - other than the numbers I see on the screen. I found this to be very immersion breaking, it didn't feel at all like I was having a hook!Problems with the game (fishing).- When I'm reeling in I have no idea what is going on underneath the water. Sometimes I was reeling in for a long long while, but the yard indicator stayed the same, and there was no other visual feedback. I didn't know if the game had glitched out and my reeling didn't do anything, or if the fish had managed to extend my line by another 100 yeards underneath the water for me to reel in afterwards. I think it would be nice to get some sort of idea of how long your line is, and not just how far away the fish is. Because this just felt so weird when I couldn't feel the force in my pole, and just stood there reeling in for minutes from a minor hook.- The fish (1 kind in this early alpha) is very athletic, it goes from one end of the lake and back in a matter of seconds. It does this for a while, then suddenly stops. Like it spend all of its energy traveling so fast from one end of the lake to the other and then suddenly colapses. It also bites the hook very frequently, so the food must me scarse around this lake. :)- As mentioned earlier you get almost no visual feedback or cues from the fishing pole, the string or the fishing guy. When you get a hook the pole, string, and the guy - they all just act as if there was no force pulling in the other end of the line. In contrast to this, the fish is going crazy underneath the water as I mentioned earlier. It just feels so unrealistic and weird. This would be okay as a side game in GTA or something like that, but this coming from a dedicated fishing simulator was disappointing.Problems with the controls:- Something feels really awkward about the controls, I have a hard time pointing out exactly what is causing this.- I think one part is the mouse sensitivity. You turn very slowly while the pole is very wobly and when you throw the line out into the water I almost have to move my hand all across the desk to get a good shot.- The throwing part does not feel consistent. Sometimes I get a really nice shot, but the next time I do the eactly same movement (with minor differences ofc), the bait may end up only 11 yards away and in another direction. It just didn't feel right.All in all, I think the basic features should have been better implemented when releasing a paid early access of a dedicated fishing game with this amount of content. I don't see a point for anyone to get it yet, UNLESS you are very interested in fishing and can't wait to get a glimpse of what this new game will look like.[Deleted the last 5 paragraphs to make room for the phase 3 review update].

												I don't want to submit a negative review at this time... but issues mentioned since the start of early access have not been fixed.  ""full controller support"" shouldn't mean move a mouse cursor around with your thumb stick to interact with menus.  also warning for those with surround/eyefinity setups, it's broken as well.  will update review upon patching as the core mechanics of this game are well done... it's just a few things (especially the controller support) that are making it un-playable for me.

												Not what it seems, very arcade-like and full of graphical bugs. Trees and bushes 'flash' and with no options to tweak graphics it very quickly annoys and ruins the whole experience. Gameplay is basic and very repetative. I've asked for a refund.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								EARLY ACCESS REVIEW BASED ON PHASE 4 RELEASE.Dovetail Games Fishing is one of those games that come to mind as unique. Or maybe even niche. Because the people who actually do fish, will be outside doing actual fishing. It makes you wonder why to even make a simulation based on it? Well to be fair to DTG, they hit the nail on the head. The game is still Early Access, so a lot of features of the game are unavailable, but as they develop it, you can really see the game shine through the cracks of it's early builds.The whole idea of fishing and just relaxing and enjoying doing something that doesn't require hard manual labour, is top notch. The game itself is based around a lake which you now, have complete control over. You can now walk and fish in different spots, you can now, change your lures, and you can even put your rod down!The attention to detail is amazing as the whole atmosphere projects a warm sunny summers day morning and the ambient sounds of birds chirping away to the splashing of over excited fish is simply sublime.To their advantage, is that the developers of the game at Dovetail, enjoy fishing and do it often. So the game is being made by fishers for fishers. I myself am not a fisher. But to play this game is to encapsulate what I do enjoy. A nice relaxing morning or afternoon in the middle of a green area.I would recommend this game based on ""Phase One"", and this review is based on ""Phase Four"". As such, I'm still going to recommend it. Quality. Absolute quality!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								keeping in mind this is Early access I bought it full well knowing it's not a complete gameThe game looks amazing in graphics departmentThere is not a lot to do just yet but it does give a look into what they are trying to produce, this game has a great future for an area in the market that is rather shallow and not a lot of fish biting, but if this game stays on track on full release it maybe a feeding frenzy.If you are into fishing and want to watch a game grow into something great, cast a line and catch your self a deal on this record size catch :)Will visit this again after there planned updates			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Huge improvements from early versions in every aspect of the game. It's not perfect, but pretty close and in my opinion has retaken the title of best fishing game on steam.Its still being developed and new content worked on so the future is bright for this game, deserves more of a player base. Great immersion, you really do feel like your by the lake and once you get the hang of the casting and fighting mechanics its a lot of run reeling in the monsters. I would like to see fish animations in the water worked on when you have a fish hooked but apart from that really enjoying this title.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Been with the game since it first hit EA on Steam, after breaking 100 hours I thought I would share my thoughts.As  there are not a massive amount of fishing games on steam and even less which are 'serious-semi serious' this one stands out. Graphically pleasing and with its current state and latest update its easy to hope in and play with friends and on your own. You can get stuck in and learn easy enough through a simple tutorial process after that its up to your style of fishing. While there are not a massive variety of fish species to be caught (something to be improved on?) what there is there proves a challenge to catch and some of the larger specimens are a great fight, the addition of boss fish and extensive tackle choice to unlock keeps you playing for a long time and the community online are a good bunch, never had any problems there.Had a lot of fun and hope it continues to be supported and more content gets added,  for me a good 8/10.

Early Access Review
								**Early Access Review Stage 1 (11/4/14)**Yea!-Realistic fishing game on PC-Looks Good-Great intro priceMeh!-Early Access/ early stage Alpha-Only 1 type of fish-Casting looks very promising-Could give something of a stats for fish when caughtBleh!-Menu is very clunky only works with keyboard-In game mouse sensitvity is awful-Tutorals need to be unlocked-Weird physics issues***Presentation-Game looks great for the stage the game is in, but there are some clipping issues with the water. But the fish and your model look pretty good overall. The water and reflections also are quite nice.The menu screen is barebone and only is navigated by keyboard. The options are barebone with only having settings for mouse sensitivity, audio levels, and Graphics detail (low,med,high,ultra), resolution with being able to select fullscreen, window or borderless window. Setting the game to fullscreen at 1440p would not display properly and only worked via windowed mode for me.Mechanics-Casting is decent once you get use to it, but suffers from mouse sensitivity issues where you have to turn it up a lot or you will be doing the picking up and dragging and repeat to start your backswing for casting. Sometimes even while releasing the line it will shoot forward then bounce back oddly. When the line is in the water it is pretty smooth sailing, and reeling in the fish is fun. I just wish upon landing the fish it would at least make up some numbers for you so you can keep trying for something other then landing another generic fish. Also be aware that the current plans is to only add in carp til a much later date.***Lowdown- As of this review the game is in very early alpha, but looks promising. With a great intro price of $7 ( which is said to increase as development continues), its a good time to buy to support pretty much the only modern realistic fishing game on steam or PC pretty much. This is only reason I recommend this game at this stage			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game hasn't added any new species, gear, lakes in a year... they are focused on xbox/ps4.  Devs are holding back updates until Xbox/Sony quality control approve the game.  Had such high hopes for this game but it is 100% console focused.  They put PC on hold when initially releasing to xbox, now this is the case again while they make their PlayStation build.
