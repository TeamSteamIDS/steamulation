												I can't say this game is a complete garbage, it's not that bad but it fits armor games way better.The problem is that this game supposed to be free to play and it's not  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

												There is barely any content and I completed this game on 100% within 10 minutes. But even though I completed the game in just 10 minutes, I felt more bored than anything else while playing, because it gets repetitive after just one minute and it's almost impossible to fail at this game.The few levels that exist are pretty much exactly the same, you just have an increasing speed. The last few levels have a high chance of making you 'motion sick' because the background scrolls so fast and really hurts your eyes.Overall, do yourself a favor and stay away from it.

												I beat this game 100%Motifero Motus is a game where you drive a car down an endless, straight highway. The only buttons required are the up and down arrow keys which you use to shift between the three lanes in order to avoid other vehicles and collect items on the road. There is only one mode and 9 levels, each lasting a minute or two.There is no reason to buy this game, there is no reason to play this game. You start out in an regular car driving down the highway. A randomly generated series of vehicles comes down and you need to avoid them. A bar at the bottom shows you how much further until the stage is finished. There is also money and every once and a while one of two powerups on the track. Each dollar sign you pick up adds 1 point to your total score. Red crosses give you another life. And the fire gives you progress on an 'upgrade' meter. Collecting these items is really easy and in the case of the money not even worth the effort. The other cars on the road are static and move from the right of the screen to the left at the same speed. The other powerups are nearly pointless. Health adds another life, represented by an image of the starting car, to the top left corner. The symbols will not go past 4 though so every life past 4 will not be visible to the player. The fire builds up a yellow meter that when full changes the appearance of your car. You can do this twice. This has no bearing on gameplay as far as I could tell as I tried the last level with the level 1 and max level cars and experienced no change. Each time you complete a level you are instantly brought into the next. The only difference between levels is that the speed is increased very slightly and starting at level three cops are added in. The cop cars appear at random and randomly shift lanes. If they hit you you lose 1 life like any other vehicle but because they have no discernible pattern and you have no options but moving up and down it is pure chance if they hit you or not. Even with that issue there's next to no penalty for losing all your lives. You keep all whatever score and car level you had when you lost and just have to start the most recent level from the start. And unless you are trying to get every single dollar on the road its actually  difficult to lose all your lives in a level.WHen you finish level nine you are told your final score and then dropped back on the main screen. Out of curiosity I played the last level again and still had the same car and score from when I won and beat it again leaving me with a higher score. So even the high score is a sham because theres nothing stopping you from just playing that level forever to get the highest score ever! But why would you bother?This entire game screams mediocrity. I wouldnt be suprised if it was actually a school project as it has all the things a beginners course in game design would teach you. The art is plain with the road just having random white spots to serve as 'detail'. There is next to no animation save for a single frame where the car turns slightly when switching lanes and a blinking fire effect when upgrading. The music is a single annoying track that can be turned off thankfully. The sound effects are exactly what you would expect. It even freeezes on occasion to load the next random set of cars.Pros Short Easy 100% Achievements  It WorksCons Boring Lacks Variety Mindless Gameplay Pointless Powerups Zero Penalties Low Quality Art and Sound ",1679,695,50,174,152,19,220

												A simplistic action game in which you use the up and down arrow keys to steer a car down a scrolling highway.  (The mouse is used to interact with the menu, in case you were wondering.)  With every succeeding level the highway scrolls a little bit faster.  You collect money in the form of dollar signs, a meaningless mechanic, since you never get to spend it on anything.  It took me 11 minutes to unlock 100% of available achievements.This is probably the result of a build-your-own-game kit;  sadly, plenty available nowadays.  This really shouldn't be on Steam, in my opinion.  And I predict Valve will remove it soon. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A quick 100% achievement game where you push up and down a lot to collect money and dodge cars as your drive faster and faster.If there was strategy, or more to it, maybe I could recommend it. But right now its simply mindless reflexes.			",356,179,15,77,34,6,77

""Dollars and Boosters""Mortifero Motus is a simple 3-lane dodge game in a very plain world. Could be mobilware. You drive with insanely speed (comeon 475 km/h seriously?) on some country highways and collect dollars for nothing and boosters for new cars. Sometimes a policecar appears that blocks you in a gap between 2 cars and lower your dollar score by 30. According to the simplicity you can beat the game 100% in less than 15 mins.

												+- it's easy- it has easy achievements- easy controls- graphic that fits the gameplay, without much extras and unnecessary distraction+-- costs 99c / right now 59c   if you are going for the acievements and looking for an easy 100% game , it's maybe worth the price. If you on the other hand expect hours of gameplay, you might be disappointed- it might be challenging, if you try to grab all the collectibles in the game to finish the levels as fast as possible, but there's no point in rushing it-- only 9 levels- very easy- there's no point in playing this game again after you finished it the first time- for non-achievement hunters maybe not that cheap/ tons of games out there that offer more for that priceYou might be able to squeeze some fun and challenging experience out of this game, if you play it at a party with your friends, but since you finished reading this review, you probably don't have many friends :D, so I can't recommend it for the masses, just for achievement-hunters.

												I'm not saying its a horrible game or something.But it's not good either.Pro:- Easy game- Good for Achievement hunters- Cards, emoticons and backgrounds (but cheap ones, even the foil ones)- Reminds me those ""avoid other cars"" quartz games from the 80'sCons:- Damn short (you can beat the game in 10 minutes)- No such thing as upgrades. You can get ""turbo"", which makes you a little bit faster , but that's a PICKUP, not an UPGRADE!- Mediocre design- Feels dizzy after few minutes (which is good, since it doesn't lasts long)- You only avoid vehicles, collect dollars, turbo and repair. That's all.For an old mobile game, it should be okay.If you want something similar but good, then check out Razortron 2000!			",1065,225,88,73,70,9,128

												lol this game is trash. only get it if you have a 5-8 year old that likes cars.i got through all 9 levels in a few min. you move up and down in 3 lanes to avoid cards and grab boosts, cash, and health also sometimes a cop car will come from behind once or twice in later stages and pass you up as you try not to get hit by him. the boosts will change your car into up to 3 different looks and the cash is only for score at the end of the 9th level.p.s. its not hard at all			",2273,774,108,301,266,34,404

												It will only take you half an hour to complete to 100% if you are young. If you are older you may need to take a break around level 7 or have a lie down because your eyes are really hurting, you feel nautious or have a migraine. Good little game though. It does what it's meant to do well. Nice graphics, nice soundtrack and decent controls (up and down).			",2566,1141,87,259,284,28,345

												This game is just... wow.The controls are so difficult (using the arrows ""up"" and ""down"") and you collect money for no apparent reason.-""You collect money for your score, dumbass!""Oh right, the score no one cares about, I forgot, sorry about that.The only challenge is the police car, really.If it's not in the mood to switch lanes and you're about to bust into a vehicle, then you can count on losing one of your lifes for sure.Man, I can't recommend this game, unless you're into simple-programmed games, you complete in under 15 minutes, but if that's the case, you better go get some ice cream instead.
