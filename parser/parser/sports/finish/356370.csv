												I was not epxecting much out of this game. But I was surprised in a good way. This game offered what I didn't think it would. But for now here is the basic pros and cons of this game:*Positives*-free to play-licenses for all teams (unlike PES)-simple and clean UI-Very well written dialogue for the in-game commentaries-Player biography and faces add authenticity to the game*Negatives*-there is no 2D map to watch your players play like in Football Manager-no soundtrack leaves you sort of audiably bored-a ton of microtransactions (expected from a free to play)-more customizations are necessary-no steam overlay-no achievements,mods,trading cards,etc. (will probably be added later)Overall, the game is superb for being a free to play. But like all free to plays there are always the microtransactions which will hinder the game's experience.Updates in the future may fix the aforementioned negatives but the game offers  so much and all you have to offer is nothing. If you dont pay the microtransactions its not the end of the world because you can still end up in your goal but it might take longer.Having all the licenses and player biographies/faces is quite impressive for a free to play whereas big corporations like Konami still struggle to get licenses.So get this game and try it out. For me I will give this game a pretty solid 7.5/10. The game is great for a free to play but there are some hindering qualities that will hopefully update soon. But for now try it for yourselves!

												A free football manager game? But is it any good? And just how 'free' it is? Keep reading to find out. (or you know, download it yourself, you lazy bum.)Pros:- Lots of official team data, if you've ever cared about football, you can easily find your favorite players and clubs.- Variety in teams, play around with the budget and players of a world-class club or try your best in saving a bottom-tier, financially ruined team from relegation.- From tactics and lineups to managing individual training routines, searching new players, upgrading team facilities, you can do everything but play football itself. (and I'm finding all that entertaining for some odd reason...)- You can observe games in real time, even request substitutions and changes to tactics during matches, so you actually feel like you want to prepare your team for every game.- Plenty of realism and chances to affect your team's performance... (finding the best tactic for your players, individual health, morale and skill levels, players age and retire eventually...)Cons:-Some of the menus are a bit clunky, for an example, I'd love to have a way viewing individual stats without going back and forth between the player data and tactics screens- Virtually no graphics, even matches themselves are simulated with sports commentary -style text notes. Is it pay to win?Not really. You can play with high-level teams that win most of their games anyhow and even teams at the bottom of the predicted rankings can squeeze out wins with proper managament. The cash shop options are definitely there but it's not like they're actively locking away your chances to enjoy the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Soccer Manager 2015 is a easy to understand football manager.It's free and has quite a large selection of leagues you can choose from.The first thing that I noticed was the lack of sound.Literally the game is on mute.I understand the game is new on Steam and it only started as a browser/mobile game,but everything about it seems so basic.The transfers aspect of the game is odd to say the least.Small teams suddenly have money to buy star players while larger teams just don't.I noticed that teams from my league don't buy players from other countries at all.Actually they don't really buy players that often from anywhere.Three seasons have passed and some top teams from my league have made only a couple of transfers.The morale mechanic in the game seems random.I was winning for 10 games in a row and some players started to decline in morale.And the really bad thing is,you can't fix it.I sold two players just because they were low morale the entire season.The simulations for games are decent,and usually there is the occasional chance of a team getting an upset,which I like.But it looks like the players are getting injured way too often.And every single injury is just for one week maximum.Also,the game doesn't have the Europa League as the second competition in Europe,there are no national teams,no club tournament between continents,you cannot choose your friendly matches before the season and the stadium,at least for my team is always at 25% capacity at best which results in no revenue from tickets.Also,almost all countries have only one league,which means that every season there will be the same teams in the standings and besides Europe,other continents don't have continental competitions.Overall the game has lots of problems but the biggest one is the transfer window.Most of the clubs just stay the same every year.Also a huge problem is the fact that a lot of players just won't come to your club.You can have have money for the salary and transfer but they will say that ''a move to your club is not beneficial for their carreers.''I played with Steaua Bucharest and reached the Quarter Finals of Champions League.I had waaay better players in my team than the rest of the league,but players from countries like Portugal,Russia,Belgium and so on won't come to my team.The good thing is,the developer has a huge list of planned updates for the game.In the future I'll try to update my review too.But for now,the game feels like it's in Beta.

												I want to clarify some things before this change of review: Don't judge this review because of my gaming time in Steam; i actually ""helped"" this guys fund this game by purchasing 3 copies of an advanced alpha paying 15 dollars each one (for a total of 35 usd) back in february 2014 when they were planning on releasing it (they even had a kickstarter project which i followed fondly).This being said; the game now has changed for the worst; they took away the daily rewards for up to 150 credits per day by logging into the game and play some matches (i was using this credits to purchase 15m ingame dollars and improve my team, as the economy really sucks and you cannot make profit with any club in the world, not even Barcelona unless you sell your whole squad).This is why now i decided to change my review; and throwing you the weakness of this game (please keep in mind that i played over 150 hours!):Cons: 1) Economy is extremely poor; you can barely afford to pay players salaries (don't even think about signing a player who is above your team's average rating!).2) The youth academy is a total waste of time; as players are mostly bad ones and if you get any good one: let's say a promising 16 years old with 78 rating with a 98 stars prospect; you will realize over the years, that the player won't even actually reach a rating of 93 even if you have the training facility maxed.3) You won't be able to upgrade your stadium more than once; meaning that you won't be able to generate more money from tickets sold; which obviously will mean that you won't be able to purchase any ""good"" player. Note: Im talking about a player rated 90-91 for Boca Juniors, who actually has Tevez in real life (Rated 93); im not taling about signing Messi or any other superstar!4) The more you play the more you will realize that sooner or later you'll be pushed to buy coins with real cash.5) Devs are ghosts in forums; not only they won't post the updates they make to the game, but they won't even read/answer your suggestions (they will do it randomly so it doesn't look like they give a rats♥♥♥♥♥about what you think).6) Careful with the player's ""values""; it depends wether if you are selling or buying them. If you are buying a player, consider paying at least 20% more of their value; on the other hand, if you are trying to sell a player, keep in mind that clubs will end up paying you 20% lesser than their actual value (sometimes you are lucky and can sell for the actual value, but this almost never happens unless you are selling a promising player).7) If you are planning to develop young players to sell them and make a profit out of them, then plan again.8) If you are thinking about signing a free agent, then think again: not only they will not accept a lower wage, but they will be taking 75% of their current value.9) Keep in mind that players here retire at the age of 33 (approximately).10) If you spent a fortune on training facilities and youth academy, you will soon realize that spending money on hookers was going to be more profitable (or maybe more enjoyable, at least).Pros:1) If you can afford spending 40 dollars, then maybe you'll have some fun.--------------------------------------------------------------------OLD REVIEW: Despite first impress; this is not a 100% microtransaction game; you can get up to 150 coins daily which is kind of OK if you don't mind waiting 20 days to get 30M ingame money. If you want to play ""faster"", then im sorry but you'll have to pay for it. It's somehow buggy in many aspects but i think time and work will polish those errors.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nice (and free) alternative to Football Manager, almost the same layouts (though it does have some differences that takes some time to get used to).Downside is that the player cannot watch the match, only read some commentaries.

												So I was playing for Chester FC, coming from the bottom. On third year I finally got promoted. I had strong team, okay facilities and maximum morale. After 12 games I had 27 points.But then I encountered Notts County.They had 5 loses in row, zero morale, terrible tactical decisions. And the most important thing: they have all their keepers sold.So, yeah, I lost 4-0. 11/10 for realism11/10 for explosive butthurtGOTY			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Worst programming bug is that game does not save anymore any game data after a while. i wrote several bug reports but no answer, no solving tipps in forum - nothing. this ruins any managing fun. bad bad programming, sad!

												For my full review check out it out on my video game blog  Game On! [chrisspeerswrites.wordpress.com] Soccer Manager vs Football Manger  Soccer Manager 2015  Fun Rating:  7/10 Pros:  F2P; Simple; Nostalgia; Updated Rosters; Quick Gameplay Cons:  Simple; Feels like a Beta game Price:  Free to Play Football Manager 2014  Fun Rating:  9/10 Pros:  Very in-depth; 3D matchs (rather than just word commentary); Realistic transfer system and wage negotiations; Data editor Cons:  Very in-depth; Too many interviews Price:  $50 (got mine for $25 at Green Man Gaming) How Do You Dethrone a King??  There really is no debate. Football Manager is better than Soccer Manager. It has more depth, options, and has been around a lot longer. It also costs more. A lot more. Especially for those “faithful” fans that buy every year’s new iteration that only contains minor updates. This just baffles me, whether it’s FM, Madden, or NBA 2K. $60 every year for the same game? Rarely do such sport franchises make any earth shattering changes that in my opinion justify buying it every single year. Roster changes don’t count as earth shattering in my book. I own Football Manager 2014 and have played 562 hours on it and I could happily play it for several more years before needing to purchase the latest iteration. Especially since it comes with a data editor that many people are willing to make those updated roster changes for you. So, how do you dethrone this ruthless tyrant that has a stranglehold on the soccer (ahem, football for most of the world) simulation management industry? Free and Simple!  Make it free-to-play (F2P), simple to play, and as an added bonus, make it similar to the very first versions of the ruthless king, like back when he was a charming prince. Soccer Manager has a very Championship Manager (Football Manager was initially called Championship Manager before a split between the developers and publisher) feel to it. My first introduction to sports sims was Championship Manager 2 back in 1995 so there’s definitely a bit of nostalgia that helps boost Soccer Manager in a positive manner. It also is F2P and has updated rosters. Since I “only” have FM2014 I was able to try out my Tottenham club with their latest real world roster without having to shell out another $50. While you do have to pay for certain things like scouting faster and additional load/save slots, none of them will stop you from playing and enjoying the game. One of the great pros of Soccer Manager is that there are very few media interviews!! Football Manager, in attempting to make you feel like you really are the manager on the sidelines, has created a very “un-fun” process of 20 questions (the answers to which impact how your players will perform so you better answer them correctly!!) before each match and several after the match, and some more questions for you to answer when you’re not in a match, just because, that’s what managers have to deal with! Well, I just want to buy players and play matches! Soccer Manager gets you back to the basics. Yes, Football Manager does have a Classic mode, which is what I exclusively use now, but it just feels like Football Manager has gotten away from what their game used to be about. Final Verdict!  Football Manager just hasn’t had much competition lately and maybe that is the reason why each version since 2012 seems to be getting worse and worse based on reviews and complaints that I’ve read. So if anything Soccer Manager will push Football Manager to be better. At the end of the day, Football Manager is better than Soccer Manager. But, Soccer Manager is free and with updated rosters, so give it a shot!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Im gonna give this game the benifit of the doubt, the 2015 version is ALOT better then the 2016 version. Don't get this game for mobile, it needs some work as of Jan 13 2016. If its a few months after and your seeing this review, go for it.So where to start? This game is a click based game that is fun for people who enjoy managing things. Something i found pretty sick, and just recently found out when i verified my account it gave me a prospect from my head scout labeled as me, my name. No profile or anything, but the fact that the game has that i found that VERY sick. So now into pros vs cons. Im not insanly good at this, but lets go for it. TL;DR Its good where it needs to be, bad where it doesn't hamper gameplay.Pros:-There is so much diversity, any team you join you will manage them differently-You are given control of everything except the soccer game itself (the one being played by your players)-its realistic in some extent. There are definate patterns I've seen after playing for 45+ hoursThis is a small list but each of these things is good for a managing game. Cons: -User interfaces could be better, searchs aren't very to the point there more generalized. Which i don't like sometimes but it isnt a deal breaker-After a certian amount of time (depending on person) the game doesn't get very satisfying seeing your team you've spent millions of dollars (ingame) lose to a team that is bottom of the league. Happened to me 4 times in a row...♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. -""Pay to win"" (don't pay towards this game, not worth)Again, small list, but these things arent to bad. If you've read this far... Awesome, Hi my names Ryan o/Do i recommend this game? YES... This game is something I enjoy because managing things is fun for me. I enjoy managing, I enjoy the feeling of something out of my control doing well, or doing bad and trying to figure out why. If you enjoy these things, this should be a fun game for you.Because I'm a nice person, heres a tip to help you get more out of your game. Don't pick the TOP TIER ULTIMATE teams, because you'll just continuously click and miss out on the point of the game. You want to pick a team thats at the bottom of the league or thats somewhere near the middle. The reason being is you'll be much happier to see your team go from bot/mid to the top of the list by your decisions aswell as it gives you a little challenge to work towards. So yeah, This game is something i find fun that you can play on basically any pc. Pick it up. its fun			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is very good for if you're just starting out.  I like the idea and the concept of it. I understand the 2D Match is still in work but man please actually work on it. Also the timing is very time consuming and when I try to speed up the game  the players go waay to fast, it should b slowed down a bit and more realistic with the passings and whatnot. Its a great game, for me at least, and I hope it becomes better than it is now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Of course its not as good as Football manager but for a free game it comes pretty damn closeFootball manager is also not avalibe on the german steam store so this is my only other option to manage a club.Pros:-Its free-Has more leagues/players then both PES and FIFA-Pretty decent interface and easy to navigate especially if your familiar with FM-Every player has personall info and picture of them to displayCons:-Microtransactions (optional)-Cant watch the game instead you get a live report that is sometimes overwhelmingly fast-No Sounds-No steam overlayFor a free version of Football manager this game did a pretty good job, of course it wont compare completely with some big differences here and there. Id recomment it to anyone who is interested into seeing the side of a manager instead of being a player. And to anyone who was looking to go into the football manager series this is def. a nice try out version. Also releasing it in the time of the real life transfer window is kinda wierd since many players arent with their displayed club anymore. Oh and how are people complaining about this being called ""Soccer"" manager? like ""Football"" manager is already taken, how else would you call it? Kickball manager?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												**UPDATE - 24/07/2015** I want to confirm that the development team have handled my missing Save Game issue expertly and professionally and I am very grateful for their support. It was all dealt with inside a week any my lost funds/game have been restored. Good support = a really good and hard to find aspect of a game. Original review below.In a nutshell - it's a free rip-off of Football Manager, drilled down to the essentials, and about a hundred times harder to do well which encourages you to pay for some in-game currency.That said, the gameplay more than made up for the difficulty and considering a season of FM can take me anything up to a month to get through, to be able to get through a season in a couple of evenings in this 'FM-Lite' is a big plus. I happily laid down my £5 for in game currency to give me some breathing room to enjoy it even more.Come on Braintree Town!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall good game.  If your a soccer fan it's the game for you.  You can choose from many many leagues and pick your favorite club.  The transfer market is amazing and you make deals just like in real life.  The one thing I don't like is that you it always says you have to share everything you do and it's really annoying.  Any computer of any age can run it. 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very simple to play Football Manager game, some flaws here and there but its FREE defo worth the time to play this game if you dont want to pay the money for FM 2015 etc. Lots of team options to chose from and can also upgrade Stadium / Training Facilities etc.Can progress through European competitions and also player Ratings go up and down depending on how they are currently playing. Worth a shot if you like football, will also be a good option if you are new to FM type games and give you an idea on how they work as the menu's are nice and simple. -Forgot to mention- There is a 2D match coming late Summer, or you can opt into the beta by paying £2.99 for the VIP edition which lasts 12months!

After putting in a good amount of hours so far I can write this.PROS-Simple, Addictive Gameplay-The joy of bringing well known players to your club-you win pretty much everything-Nice layoutCONS-You win pretty much everything-Upgrading to VIP does NOT work (for me at least)2-D live match is coming late in the Summer if you want to wait. Or attempt to pay the $4.00 to get VIP and Beta access to the 2-D match. Overall a fun game, I have enjoyed my time with it. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
