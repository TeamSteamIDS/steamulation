												I made a review before this a few days into early access, and if you want a TL;DR I'll paraphrase one of my previous lines - buy into it if you're fine with being an alpha tester. I am. It's flawed, but fun.So as Robot Arena III rolls into a full release, it must be considered that the devs themselves say that it's more of a tactical move to bring it out of early access, what with the Steam summer sale approaching fast. But I'm not here to knock their sales strategy.Having a binary recommendation option is tough for some games; this is one of them. To recommend it right this moment as a full release title would be to grossly overrate it's current quality and depth of content. The physics aren't all there as a simulation game, with bad collision physics in certain circumstances and with certain components. Components can still be placed anywhere without any boundaries. The career mode does not reset when all of the tournaments have been finished. There's a bug where the camera won't stop moving up or down in the bot lab after battling some AI opponents that should have been swatted by now.But to not recommend it would be to downplay the monumental effort the devs have been undertaking in the last 4 weeks to improve the game. The first day of early access the game was considered 'full', and it was a mess. You couldn't even build a wedge shaped robot because every robot had box collisions. Now you can. The biggest drive motors would make your robot flip on the spot like one of those toy backflipping dogs unless it weighed as much as a star. Now they don't. Weight classes are back. Should all of these things been in the game on day 1? Absolutely. But they also could have just dumped the game there and then and moved on. They haven't. I respect that.They have good ideas. The 5 layer chassis system is great for rounded shapes or crafting detail. Being able to move components after placing them is one of the best quality of life improvements they could have made after RA2. Someone on Gametechmods[www.gametechmods.com] figured out how to mod the game, even if it's crude at the moment, so a modding community is imminent. Robot Arena III will be great. It's just not 'great' this second.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RA2>RA3That being said, if they continue work on RA3 and put more customization into it and fix the bugs..RA3>RA2. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really didn't want to write this review. I'd been one of the more vocal people in the discussions, offering advice on bugs that needed fixing, as well as features I feel should be added/restored. I even emailed these directly to the dev team's preferred email address. I've been tough on the game, but I always hoped that the developers would prove me wrong, that they would update this game into something that humiliates Robot Arena 2.But they instead released it out of Early Access in a buggy, unfinished state and we're approaching two months of not hearing a word from them, unless they are secretly building a big update I feel its safe to say the game is dead.Lets go over just some of the issues.Firstly, the physics are broken. Robot Arena 2 could have issues sometimes but firstly the game is 13 years old, and secondly they weren't as bad at this 2016 release. There was many a time when I would see robots take off seemingly into orbit from the smallest tap.Secondly the glitches are everywhere. Bot building is broken, I don't have to have parts connect to anything and they will still work fine. I can have parts clipping into each other and the game sees no problem with this. When I play Robot Arena 2 they wouldn't let this happen.Robot Arena 2 also wouldn't let me break the career mode, in Robot Arena 3 when it updated a robot that I had built was set to the U class, I cant edit the bot to change it and the tournaments it was in are now impossible to finish. I also found out after deleting a different robot that that one was in a tournament, making that one impossible to finish. Robot Arena 2 has a weight limit and doesn't let you delete robots that are in a tournament in career mode. Robot Arena 2 is 13 years older.The game is way too loud, and the sound is overall a mess. No matter what I do to tinker with the sound it remains for me at the sound level of a Freddy Fazbear jump scare. Plus the game cant handle many sounds at once, I've had many times where because a lot was happening the music would cut out.There is no weight to any attacks in this game, in Robot Arena 2 if I smash a battle axe down onto an opponent, it hits hard. It feels satisfying to destroy opponents that way, but in Robot Arena 3 the hits are far less satisfying, and weapons seem to snap off if you so much as breathe next to them.The only thing I can truly say Robot Arena 3 has over Robot Arena 2 is in the customisation, and even then I'd recommend getting a modded copy of Robot Arena 2 for more tools to play with. They've had a lot of work put into them, and help to keep a 13 year old game fresh even today. (There is even an ongoing mod called the official robot wars mod, its worth checking out!). Also Robot Arena 3 does look better, but I would be disgusted if it didnt look better visually.All in all, just look for a free download of Robot Arena 2, instead of paying Â£15 for this game. Its nowhere near finished and it likely never will be finished which is probably the most insulting thing, as they deemed this ready for a full release and took it out of early access. If things turn around I will update this review, but I'm not holding out for much hope.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								First time I ever disliked something that bad that im refunding, The game is really really early and not finished to even be considered early alpha.I would recommened all fans of the previous games to stay away from it until all the basics are finished. Everything just feels so bad. no options outside of the launcher.Some of the noise and models are from Robot arena 2, controls to create the robots are horribly designed for consoles in mind rathar than Pc.Graphicly feels like a really old game. but i can say the game preforms nicely.For now i would say to AVOID it, wait it out and see if it fixes most of the problems any Early access game has.

Early Access Review
								Needs lots of work as the game is early access, but you can build some pretty funky stuff then drive it around.Was a huge fan of RA2, and so far have been a huge fan of RA3.Lots of freedom to build to your heart's content. You can build some completely unrealistic abominations that make absolutely no sense, then blame it on the game developers, or you can build some really neat stuff. The freedom may allow cheating, per se, but it can also allow you to make some complicated contraptions, art, replicas, or things that were only possible through exploits or cheat components in RA2.You can build totally IRL, or you can freely build completely unrealistic without the use of exploits.

												It is with great regret that I post a No Review. Robot Arena III is not finished yet. For a ""released game"" it is on par with Sword of the Stars II. There are some great ideas and vast improvements on the orriginal, but it is not a complete game yet. This game never should have left early access in its current state.Good:-Excellent improvements on the RA2 designing system-Complete chassis customizability-Loads of parts and weapons to make truely unique machines of death!-Freaking ROBOT AREANA 3 !!!!!Bad:-Not pollished at all-Bugs in the bot editor-Very buggy physics-Sometimes your bot just implodes when you load it into the arena-No LAN multiplayer ?!?!-No editor undo button ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								This game has improved massively in the two short weeks since it's release. Don't get me wrong, it's still far from perfect, but the potential that this game has is very clear, and in it's current state, the game is actually quite fun to play. I know a lot of people, myself included, were very skeptical of the devs of this sequel to what can be described as a 'cult classic' game, but so far they have shown that they are willing to continue supporting the game and listening to the fans of Robot Arena, both here and on the GameTechMods forums despite the negative feedback that the game (mostly deservedly) recieved in it's first week of release. That, in itself is commendable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You had one job, guys. One â¥â¥â¥â¥ing job and half the time you havent even been seen about.The Dev's are AWOL as far as i'm concerned and have been for ages, the game still needs a hell of a lot of work and yet there hasnt been an update in a long time. Because of this, i highly recommend you do NOT buy this.Will update if they ever show their faces again. Quite a shame because there are some nice ideas here but Robot Arena 2 just... it just works and you can get it for free if you do some digging.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
