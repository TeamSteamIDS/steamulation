												Pixel Puzzles Junior is a puzzle game (≧︿≦) for little kids, but you grown up mens can also play it, the game is actually decent, and the puzzles are not that hard. Also the BGM is amazing! ~ 7/10			",492,180,16,44,79,10,49

												A fun little puzzle game that is appropriate for children of all ages. Added to the fact it goes up to 56 pieces Many adults will enjoy it as well. The only con I was able to find is that the window mode is not well configured. When activated a good quarter of the screen is hidden from view. Still, all in all very nice.8/10Pros-Cute picturesoutlining of the puzzle pieces available.Picture of puzzle available.choice of how many pieces in each puzzle ranging from 9 to 56.Cons-Music is a bit annoying.Windows mode does not work well.

												Fun and easy to understand puzzle game suitable for all. Because of adjustable levels of difficulty, it is easy to customize the game to each player (You choose how many pieces you want and whether you want help lines etc.).The pictures are funny too...			",219,190,7,55,76,8,69
