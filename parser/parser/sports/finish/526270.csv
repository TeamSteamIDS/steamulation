												This game is fun. Good graphics and nice things to do. I love the levels where you need to jump arround. Multiplayer would be better if there are more players but i think it will come by time.			",183,72,7,25,22,3,13

												Gives me terrible vertigo due to the movement system. You don't teleport yourself places, it's a bit too sensitive of a touchpad movement system that sends you zooming in whatever direction you choose. That being said, the games themselves are mostly fun. The bugs, such as randomly dropping the bow and struggling to pick it up (holding, then not), take away from the fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
