												Okay, I don't write reviews but this game has me hyped. It is a lot of fun and it feels pretty real (I have played net a few times though I'm typically a forward).I'm assuming this is a WIP but with that said, I do have a few gripes that I hope get fixed:1. The pucks don't despawn, so even after you made the save, if you accidently hit a dead puck into the net, it counts against you2. The goalie stick clips through the ground so it makes it pretty hard to lay your stick flat on the ice in order to make a low sick save.3. Personally I think there should be some sort of torso that way they cant get you between the glove and blocker. It feels pretty unnatural to reach across with the glove to make a save4. The puck just clips through the glove and stick once you make a save. It makes it really hard to clear the crease and to have one of the great ""ring ten bells for that save"" momentThese are minor things, but I think fixing this will make the game betterAlso, I think there are some features that should be added:1. It would be cool so see a ""heatmap"" of where you let in most goals (ie: if you look at the net after a game, it will show red for where you let in the most goals and like a yellow or green for where you protected the net the best)2. Shootout mode: It would be pretty cool if the skaters would start at center ice and you'd have a true 1v1 experience instead of just a shooting gallery.3. Skater mode: I don't know how well it would work, but I would love for there to be a way where you get to shoot against a goalie. Locomotion would be difficult so my idea is that you would see like an ice rink whiteboard where you could draw the path that you would skate. Then you confirm it, and that is the path that you follow. (It may make people sick but I would be willing to test that). This would allow for online matches where you get to test your skills against a real personOverall a good game, especially because it is free, but I would defnitely spend $30 dollars on the game if it had the fixes and features meantioned above!(The new minor fixes that came out really help the game out. The visible torso is fantastic and the despawning pucks prevent any accidental late goals. Puck handling seemed a bit better as well, I was able to clear the crease pretty effectively athough it isn't very necessary anymore, thanks for the update!)			",30,11,0,3,5,2,1

												Had a chance to download and play a few rounds of this game tonight.  As a retired hockey netminder I was very happy and excited to finally see a hockey game here and its in VR!!!  I definately agree with everyone's comments and suggestions and would love to see them added in the future.  YES!  I wouldn't mind paying for the add-on as well. Overall, a great start and looking forward to the updates!!  Lets go REDWINGS!!!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay, It's very simple. You're a goalie, stop the pucks. I was suprised how fun this was. As a Canadian I approve. It's a demo right now but there could be some awesome gamplay here in the future. Also adjusting the height of the paddle would be coo, it's a bit long.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a good Sim.  I don't understand why it gets knocked for dead pucks just laying around and going into the net.  Everyone that has been or is a goalie knows they need to control your rebounds.  If you leave a rebound you can swipe your stick and clear the puck out but if your good you direct the puck into the ""corner"".  The pucks that people claim that are going in, when the puck is being shot that shouldn't, are not on their angle, you have to actualy move side to side along the crease to be square to the puck.  One opton I would like to be added is the length of the paddle on the stick, I find it to be too long and my hand is out way too far to compensate (insert joke here).			",294,128,13,57,84,5,48

												Realistic, but not difficult. Been wanting a free to play hockey game for a long time- this fits the bill 100% so I gotta give it 5/5 stars. The differences in difficulties are barely recognizable but the game's pretty easy, the saves feel satisfying, and it's relatively simple fun.Now if we only had a skater simulator... :)			",43,7,2,7,10,4,3

												I really want to give this a positive review, but it has many flaws. While I did have fun playing it, the physics of the puck and its interaction with your gear is horrible. I couldnt even figure out how to hit the puck out of the way with my stick once I blocked it. If these bugs are fixed and the blocking feels a lot more realistic, ill definitely give it a positive. Nothing like having pros shoot super fast pucks at you!			",90,29,4,8,24,4,17

												I would like to see more haptic feedback if my stick is through the ice. Also the option to have like an automatic leg detection so when I drop butterfly, the lower half is protected.			",186,35,2,27,20,5,14

												I enjoy playing this game but I have two major issues with it.  The first is that the puck goes through the glove frequently.  The second that makes this game less enjoyable is the position of the stick is off.  the programers set the position of the controller as the glove when it would make much more sense to make the stick handle match the controller's grip.

												This game is a promising look at what's to come for hockey experiences on VR. There are certainly flaws, including wonky phsyics (which is the only reason I'm scored on /s), but is still a game I play every VR session. There is no reason to not reccommend Goalie Challenge VR, but I do hope for an update soon to fix some nagging issues and improve the longevity of this game.			",33,11,2,5,12,3,2

												It's a short ""Be a goalie"" experience that's actually really fun. Sure, physics ain't 100% and there's (at the time of writing) no pads, so the low shots can feel ackward. Lots of content? No, but really fun none the less.I'd gladly pay for a version with a more fine tuned experience and a bit more content, but for a free price there's no reason not to recommend it. You want to try to be a goalie and save some shots? Awesome, then download this and enjoy!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Absolutely a blast to play. However some things I have noticed. Shots to the outside of the net count occationally, and the AI shoots before the previous puck has landed making you jump back and not follow the shot up. Also if you knock a puck it on accident from shots before even round before it still counts.			",51,12,0,4,26,3,2

												What a fun game. After ten minutes of play I was sweating bullets Great leg workout....ahahaha...for real.Great potential for upgrading...How about options for NHL uniforms....moving players...and swithcing between shooter and goalie.....and an option for coming out of the net and kicking the crap out of the forwards?

												If you find a way to add a body to this so you can make positional saves instead of just Glove and Stick, this is hands down one of the most entertaining games i've played on my HTC VIVE.  Still loads of fun as it is.  Lots of potential for something like this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've only just started this game and currently loving it. As a big hockey fan this is the first VR Goalie game I have seen personally. Can't wait to see what updates come (hoping they do). Below are my Pros and Cons on Goalie Challenge VR. I'm sure the Developer knows of the issues and I'm not complaining but if this review helps make this game slightly better. It was worth it.Pros:Free!!!Very nice looking graphicsWell balanced enough controls to have fun and functional playFunAddictiveIf you really get into it pretty activeCons:Shooters shoot quickly after a save. If you wanted to clear the crease or see where the rebound went you have to be careful of the next shooter.Goalie stick breaks collision with the ice surface. So some easy handles just go straight in the net if not careful.Puck will clip through the glove if moved to fast. Same with goalie stick.No center mass, so you're goalie might as well have the name Swiss Cheese on their Jersey ;PFun ideas:Endless mode - Infinite Lives and just shot after shotAdd an Offensive Sakter to screen goalie - Makes the goalie adjust to see puck *more realistic*Customize glove, blocker and goalie stick9/10 ~ Love it so far. Gonna keep my eye out for the Dev team to make some more fun stuff!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Thank you, thank you, thank you! I am (used to be) a goalie but I can never play again because I broke three ribs diving for a puck - well that and I'm old now. I really felt the exhilaration of that moment before a 103 MPH slapshot comes at me. VR is probably the only way I'll ever be in net again and I thank you guys for this. The physics and the graphics are great! Like I said, that sense of exhilaration came back. Saying that (and I know that right now this is actually a deficiency with VR) Some of the collision is off - oddly enough it's happening when the puck is slow or stopped but it is almost flawless when it is fast. I noticed that the ice has a colldier but the stick goes through the ice. That feels weird. It would be nice to have the ice and stick collide with haptic feedback.One of my ritual (OCD?) things when I played for real was to clear the pucks out of the way during warmup and it was infuriating that I couldn't really successfully do it in this game - but that's just me. Although I did see a few other folks mention that. Is the puck fitted with a convex mesh collider? Possibly if the stick was a mesh collider as well you might get better results?Also, I noticed that the depth of the glove was rather shallow. Maybe I just was used to and had a deeper one? I dunno. All in all this is a dream come true for me. I get to play goalie again! YAY!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
