								Super relaxing game. Definitely a go to game for unwinding and playing something that goes at your own pace with its own bit of challenges.			",160,11,4,13,8,2,13

								Although not a perfect game, there's a lot of quality content here, and the Devs are still working on it and adding new content all the time!If you like rube goldberg machines, golfing games, physics games, casual games, or even challenging games, then Fantasy Fairways is for you.The gameplay varies from being able to beat a level first try, to having to find some way to abuse the physics systems  and force a ball through a wall to make the level less frustrating. Which is a good thing.The art is great, there's so much extra little touches of animation and effects on everything that really are fun to look at.The gameplay can be a little hard around ther edges at times. The game is designed to reward players for building up a shot over multiple moves, by adding and moving things around but keeping the same ball trajectory. The only problem is some obsticles work on a world timer, and not a shot timer, so the physics wont always be consistant between shots. (I'm told that the devs are working on this issue)			",176,64,2,9,15,5,16
