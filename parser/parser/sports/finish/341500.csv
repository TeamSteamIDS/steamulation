												Finally finished the game! This game is definitely very unique and really put in an amazing effort to incorporate puzzle and platformer to a new level. The game's difficulty had a pretty good progression and did really great job to make players think for themselves and find out themselves how to go to the next level - which, by the way, is very satisfying when you did figure it out.The most fun parts are where there are more than one way to solve the majority of the puzzles. There are some where you can pretty much just solve it one way; however, these are essential ""skills"" (in terms of knowledge / know-how) that you would be using later on. It's very satisfying figuring out how to do it and then being able to use them on the levels later on.This game also has a HIGH replay value! If you just initially went for the next level, you might want to tackle the game a bit differently the next time you try the same level by exploring more around the levels and finding mementos (sort of pretty much like item collection) which reveal more about the setting/situation. There are also medals where you can try to use the least amount of times you must use your ability(camera) which makes you view the game on more of a ""thinking/puzzle"" level. And lastly of course, there's also the finish the level as fast as possible medals. I can TOTALLY see this as a great game for Speed Runs.Not to mention! They also have a level editor. So... you finished the game? Time to bust out some of what you've learned from just finishing the game and make your own level! Not very many games I know has this kind of feature that's something I would think only the developers would have and not share to people. Highly recommended and worth the money.Try it out! It's one of those games that I'd say: ""yeah, that was pretty unique and fun."" It just hits the right amount of satisfaction for platformers and puzzle solvers alike.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Brilliant!I'm having a blast playing Camera Obscura. The unique art style is great and really gives me a fun and retro-indie feel, but with a professional polish. Combined with such an amazing sound track that's worth a purchase all on its own, this game experience has been exactly what I was hoping for. Immersive, challenging, lighthearted, and rewarding.The learning curve does a wonderful job at consistently testing your perceivable boundaries and pushing you to break them over and over as new obstacles are tossed your way. Each time I overcome an interesting hurdle in Camera Obscura I'm always left with both a rewarding feeling and the curious notion of whether or not that was the only solution to the puzzle. The snapshot ""afterimage"" mechanic is so clever in the unbelievable number of unforseen ways it can be used and in how easily it adapts to the user's play style. I found myself constantly discovering new ways to solve simple and complex puzzles, even surprising myself with solutions I hadn't seen at first.The controls feel very smooth and play wonderfully with a game pad. Which is of paramount importance in a platformer that pushes you to break your limits. You can play with joystick or D-pad on a controller, or with a keyboard if preferred, the game doesn't limit you with any one option, but a gamepad definitely was a good choice.The story is as much a beautiful puzzle as the rest of the game. I found it to be both mysterious and intreuging. At first I had the intention of speeding through the levels to prove that I could overcome each challenge, but after falling into the story I now want to revisit each stage to find the little missing pieces of the overall plot that are tucked in every corner.Overall I feel that Camera Obscura really nailed the delivery with this fantastic Puzzle-Platformer Adventure.I'd recommend this title to anyone looking for a high spirited and fun filled experience that will challenge them to think outside the box and push their limits!Enjoy!!

												I really wanted to like this game, but I can't play it anymore.  It could be that I suck hardcore with games like this, but then again, maybe this game is for someone else.  Probably not the average player though.I only got through the first two sets of levels and I really did like how the dev integrated puzzle solving within the platforming genre, giving the genere a brand new direction to take.  Kudos on how muitple solutions existed, where only the end-goal mattered and it was up to the player for how resourceful and time-efficient the solution is.What really got me was the stiffness of the mechanics since it was more frusterating than satisfying.  From the automatic timing of when the afterimage becomes stationary to the bulkiness of the character, I didn't feel I had enough control over my character and her tools to feel satisfied whenever I solved a level.  I wasn't able to place the afterimage exactly where I wanted to, and there wasn't much brains involved compared to split-second movements. It is a charming game with good art and clever design choices.  But due to the frusteration is caused me, it's not a game for everyone.  If you are willing to put up with stiff mechanics and support an indie developer with incredible potential, by all means get this game.  Otherwise, you're not missing much other than a lot of frusteration.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Camera Obscura is a very simplistic looking side-scroller, that is reminiscent of something on the NES or Super NES. What makes this particular game different from other similar games is our ability to manipulate your surroundings by taking a photograph. When you take a photograph it creates an afterimage which you can then manipulate for a few seconds to create obstacles, bridges, stairs etc. There are 57 levels of the tower you must climb and each level contains photographs you can collect. The levels are timed allowing you to earn up to a gold star if you complete it withina certain length of time. As you progress the difficulty becomes greater with wild animals, and dangerous traps. For as simplistic as it looks, it is actually a lot of fun. You can really toy around with the afterimage effect and explore.From what I understand there is also a custom level editior with this game meaning you can make your own levels and share them on the steam workshop. This would be very interesting to see how creative and insane of levels people can come up with. All in all, it is a decent buy. Probably best to buy it as part of the developer aliance bundle so you have a few other games to play around with as well,			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What the...?! I play this game way too much...This game is a platformer with a nice atmosphere, an entertaining gimmick, and great speedrunning potential. I'm actually speedrunning this game these days.This is a standard platformer with one difference, you can copy surrounding platforms and place them elsewhere, temporarily creating new platforms.This game gives you medals for two things: using your ability the least amount of times, and beating the level ASAP. In the 2nd condition's case, basically an Individual Level (IL) speedrun. It gets very addicting as, first you route the best path to speedrun, then you keep resetting a level over and over again until you get that perfect run with minimum mistakes and high optimization. I actually postponed beating the main game for about 30 hours just so I could shave milliseconds off of my previous run.And then one of my friends inevitably finds a better route and the cycle continues. I have over 100 hours in this game, so ya listen to me. If you want to get into speedrunning, this is like a gateway drug.Also, get the Developers Alliance Bundle. I recommend the 3 other games, too. Out There Somewhere is especially popular.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a great experience. Utilizing a fascinating mechanic of taking a 'snapshot' of your surroundings to solve each level, it proves that simplicity is often the most effective. As you climb the tower more and more of the story is revealed to you and drives you to discover more. As the levels mount in difficulty you need to take everything the game has taught you thus far into account. The puzzles are lovely to look at and challenging, with wonderful music following you as you go. It is a great feeling when you finally crack the secret of each level.Definitely worth 7.79! Have fun!!     ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Basic InformationTitle:  Camera ObscuraDeveloper:  Anteater GamesPublisher:  EQ-Games, Anteater GamesGenre:  Classic style platformerGeneral ImpressionCamera Obscura (“Dark Chamber” in Latin) is a 2D platformer that pays homage to old school 2D platformers but also tries to innovate with a pretty interesting gameplay mechanic. The game’s story revolves around the quest of photographer to climb the ruins of a tower. And the innovation comes in the manipulation of the levels themselves in a similar manner to Fez. But the afterimage effect is more than just a gimmick and it works very well with the storyline. It is not an easy game and you will be restarting levels often enough. The soundtrack is surprisingly good for a platformer and the introduction of Achievements and Trading Cards make Camera Obscura, a nice addition to any collection.Strong Points+ Clever gameplay mechanics.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- Quite difficult.- Sparse save checkpoints.Rating 7/10 This review was submitted for SUPER Giveaways.

												Since the game's release I've put about eight hours into it, about split evenly between level progression and trying to get the various medals. It's proven to be a very addicting game, as I'm finding myself saying 'okay one more try' or 'let me see what this next level is' many times. It's also very fun, there's not much to it apart from the various platforming elements. There's still some stuff in the trailer I haven't gotten to yet, so the game doesn't throw everything at you right away, and each level is pretty different. The platforming is nice and tight, as you're able to control how hard you jump, which comes in handy during speedruns when you just need to make a little hop. Respawns are quick, or if you want to restart the level, that's very fast as well. The camera element, or 'flashing', is interesting. Essentially, when you hit X, you make an afterimage of the background, which follows you for about two seconds before stopping, and then stays there for a few seconds more. You use this to create steps, lift enemies, and get to places you otherwise couldn't reach. It will take a bit of time to master this, as you'll have to learn when is the best time to jump before the platform halts its movement. But when you do you'll be able to move around levels like a pro.Each level has a Time challenge and a Flash challenge. Bronze, Silver, and Gold medals for using the least amount of flashes possible, or beating it in the least amount of time. Sometimes getting gold for both happens at the same time, sometimes they're mutually exclusive. They're definitely challenging, but I wouldn't say they're unfair. Though it can be aggravating getting a time of 23.01 and you need to get a 23.00 to get the gold. But it's fun to see what shortcuts are in the levels. One that comes to mind can be completed in about five seconds, or over a minute, depending on if you know the trick or not. And when you're doing the speedruns, you'll often find the enemies are placed in juuust the right area to screw you over if you don't do it right. But then you get to do it and then you can laugh and laugh and laugh.For the story, I haven't really delved into it yet. There are mementos you can find as collectibles. The main character is a photographer, and she's looking for somebody at the top of this tower. But anything other than that I either don't know or don't want to spoil. The memento give a history of the tower you're climbing, and what you're trying to accomplish, but it's not needed to enjoy the game. Only problem I have with this is there's no indication of what levels have mementos left uncollected, so you may want to write down what mementos you find in each level, as they're at least numbered.The music is nice, I think there are about eleven tracks. They don't get repetitive and create a nice ambience for the game. Tempted to pick up the soundtrack myself. I would estimate that if you were just going through the game, trying to get to the end, it would last you at least ten hours? I'm only at the halfway point myself, and it's definitely getting harder, so it'll take longer to beat the last levels. But it still hasn't reached unfair levels of difficulty, or Braid-level lateral reasoning to beat a puzzle. But then, that time doesn't count trying to get medals, or going back for mementos you missed. I did end up spending half an hour trying to get the two golds on one tricky level, but that feeling of satisfaction after I got them, oh, that was palpable.There's also a level creator, but I haven't yet gone into that. But that's definitely something I'm looking forward to seeing after everyone develops some new levels. For the levels in the game, as I said before, there's a lot of variety. It changes the general theme of the level as you climb the tower, getting more mechanical as opposed to the stony architecture of the first levels, which is cool. There are moving platforms, switches you need to hit (or use monsters to hit), tiles that can't be flashed, tiles that need to be switched on to be flashed, and oh yes: no spikes whatsoever. If you die it's simply from falling down a pit or touching an enemy.Definitely a good purchase, especially for the price. Absolutely recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Camera Obscura is a platformer with an interesting mechanic, but some glaring issues when you're going for 100% completion. If you're not, it's an ok game, but you'll need some patience anyway. It has alot of unfair and unnecessarily annoying sections, that have not much to do with difficulty and platforming skills but are just plain bad level design.- horrible collision detection with enemies. The hitbox is a box with always the same size, even though some animation frames make enemies very small, filling only a tiny spot in that box (slime's fall animation, for example, for those how already know the game)- the menu has some unskippable slow fades and transitions. That gets annoying when you go through there alot. Selecting a level is especially tedious, you have to wait through multiple transitions when selecting a level.- ugly graphics. There are alot of games out there that prove that 2D pixel graphics can look great. This game is the opposite.- no restart level button, you have to go through the menu to restart the level, which you will do ALOT.- no on screen timer. When you try to beat specific level times for medals and achievements, you have no idea how you are doing, until you see the end screen.- when you start a level (coming from the previous level or the level select menu), there is a fade-in time during which you can't see anything, but the level timer has started anyway. For beating the times, you regularly will want to immediately restart the stage to start without the fade-in.- the story is presented in text snippets. Yes, simple text, nothing else. Not even an interesting or eye-pleasing font.- several levels have long boring sections where you are just walking or even just waiting for a moving platform, for example. And you will have to repeat those sections alot, because afterwards there is no checkpoint and some difficult section follows. You'll die alot, and you'll wait through the boring section again and again in each retry.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a very difficult game that is a mix between a platformer and a puzzler. Due to the difficulty of this game, i abadoned it myself because im basically stuck on a floor i cannot pass.The game, also, at this point, has been abadoned by the developers, even though some parts of the game are impossible to recover certain memento's, such as #56. If you can get it legitimately, without using the level editor, please feel free to post on the forum as everyone here would like to know too.NOT recommended for the developer abadoning a puzzle game where it is impossible to get all collectibles throught the game without cheating.  I suggest others would change their reviews to negative due to the developer abadoning their product and making it impossible to get all collectibles in it (#56 to be precise!).For more info on memento #56, please see this post:http://steamcommunity.com/app/341500/discussions/0/371918937286000866/ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Camera Obscura is an intresting little game. Its main selling point is a unique mechanic that allows one to manipulate the world by means of screenshots. I'd suggest that you watch the video on the store page if you havn't already to get an idea of how it works. Now the question is, is it any good? From what little I've played, I think so. The game requires you to evalute your surroundings and use the screenshots to figure out how to best solve the levels. Once you have beaten a level, you can always replay it and try to complte it in a faster time or by using less screenshots. Is it a groudbreaking game? No, not really. But for what it is, it is a pretty cool puzzle platformer. I also recommend picking up the soundtrck when it goes on sale. Not only does it compliment the game well, but it is nice to listen to on its own.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I tried to like this game, I really did, but I just couldn't. The concept of the game is interesting using your camera flash to create platforms out of already existing platforms in order reach the next platform. It also has some interesting puzzles, and honestly I thought it was good at first. My biggest issue with this game however are the controls, and that's why I have a hard time reccomending this game. It even has a solid soundtrack, nothing revolutionary or super memorable but it wasn't bad by any means in fact the music is probably the best part of the game! However, the controls are extremely stiff and I dunno, they just feel akward to play with. In my opinion what makes a good platformer is it's controls. When a platformer has controls that make the game feel harder than it really is then in my personal opinion it's not really a good platformer... On the plus side the price tag for this game is only $2 so if you still think you want to give this game a try feel free to, it's not like you will lose out on much money!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Innovative, but just not very fun.  While the central mechanic has potential, it's surrounded by a world built on poor design choices.  One slip-up, and you'll find yourself having to do some serious backtracking from a long fall down, or back from an arbitrary checkpoint a couple obstacles ago.  This is a game where experimentation is absolutely required to master a pretty quirky mechanic, and when the basic motivation to solve puzzles is sapped away, you're left with a game you keep closing out of and later trying to get back into.  I've been doing just that for literally years, and I'm done.The soundtrack, however, is great.  The game is not.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Disclosure: Received review copyI have managed to avoid this game type before so to me the idea of using a camera to manipulate game enviroment the way it's done in Camera Obscura is new.  But it works as game pace at least now when i am nearing half-way trough the tower is quite good, relaxed even i would say. Early on you rush trough levels but then you notice those memento pictures in almost unreachable places and you wonder how to get there. Then there's the medals you get for using as little flashes as possible and time to complete a level.  These combined makes up for a pretty good base for a game where you learn new tricks to get over obstacles you could not figure out before.  Good luck getting those achievements that are awarded for getting all the gold medals. Even silver level is tough as nails to get them all.  This game is also one of thoses games where many times the solution to a problem is right in front of you but you were not thinking it right. Many 'aha' moments when your knowledge of the game increases (i have grinded the levels to get to the achievements - not quite there yet but i will get them). Game mood is quite relaxed even though this game can be a real skill requiring platformer when you get down to it. But you can just enjoy it 'as is' which is a plus.  Only thing i find bad about the game is boring color palette. Many modern platformers are like a bag of rainbow candy compared to this.  Soundtrack is decent but repetetive also.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Camera Obscura is a small little indie title that I personally find equal parts charming and frustrating.  The puzzle mechanic here has a lot of potential, but the trailer is a bit misleading, as your after image moves with you for a second or so, then it stops, giving you lots of flexibility, but it can also be infuriating later on when you need finesse.I like Camera Obscura.  The art style has a great deal of charm even if, in my opinion, the animation is a bit choppy here and there.  The story, hidden in the collectibles, is pretty moving and sad, equal parts a character study of our heroine and a look at the cult that built a tower to the sun.  The gameplay is surprisingly devious, to the point where it can get frustrating or be really innovative, depending.  I have spent some time yelling at my computer screen, but generally, it is pretty enjoyable.Controls are fluid, but I HIGHLY recommend a usb controller, just for the difficult platforming sections.  The music is far and away the best part of the game, equal parts mysterious, calming, hectic, and adventerous.  This soundtrack is truly awesome.The collectibles and the secret endings can be a bit frustrating as there are no guides to help with them, as of this posting, and the answers are seldom ever clear.  I got two of the three endings with a lot of experimentation.I do recommend the game.  It's charming and fun, with a game mechanic that you will have to be really inventive with to use to the fullest.  As far as platformers go, it can be a bit frustrating, but as far as puzzlers go, it's deviously clever.Camera Obscura.  Worth a playthrough, I think.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
