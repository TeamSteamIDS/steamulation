Early Access Review
								Played the game a lot. Consider myself a veteran. Delayed my review in order to see if the early access isn´t going to be abused. Been active in game and out of the game, spent hours on testing bugs, finding out cheats and many more.Throughout the whole year we got one new runner (champion/god/character for the MOBA player), there are now nine of them. They gave some of the runner new cosmetics, which are except two of them only recolours. Every time someone pins them down in the discussions, they reply with ""early access"". The excuse has been used so much that either the little nice community doesn´t realize that the game didn´t go anywhere the last year or they are just plain up ignorant.Point is there have been patches, some of them did contain stuff u could argue got the game somewhere, there even have been balance patches after the game got played by the same 3 runners every game. There also has been a tournament with prize money. A buggy, abusable game like this shouldn´t have a prize tournament, but that´s up to the devs. The community consists of nice people, in my opinion those ♥♥♥♥er did more to keep the game alive than everyone else.To sum it up here is my list:Pros:- Nice community- Has huge potential- First sport game that tries to get into e-sports- Made a balance patch after the community has been whiny enoughCons:- No progress- Last patches made the game even worse- Unbalanced- Can´t even correct simple pictures or runner info after a year- Abusing early access- Chaotic game management and development (wonder if SHG knows of half their links they posted (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11EbUQ8Xvm-oodM3Reb4lKmoLf9kelmddQUHinx3GDnI/edit#gid=1801396602))- Told us the release date would be early 2k16 with more runner and a better performance overallI have been waiting long enough to post a review, months ago it might have been a positive one, but right now, the game is not worth even downloading. Since I am testing it every once in a while I am going to update the review if there is something positive to talk about.Edit: Tested it a couple of days ago, no changes, game seems to be abandoned, last saved video of their streaming channel has been 5 months ago. Seems since JTs contract run out, the game pretty much lost it´s last breath.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although it has a small community as I make this post, this game is simply amazing. The concept of a third person futuristic hockey/soccer game not only sounds radical but IS radical. I hope the community for this game expands, as I know it will, because this game honestly deserves it. Behind every great game is a great team of developers, and that is true with Project Cyber and Spearhead Games.11/10. Would play all day.			",62,4,1,2,6,0,3

								So after a good 5-6 months I decided it's time for a legit review. Arena: Cyber Evolution HAD a lot of potential, it really did. BUT after those 6 months of playing I realized there was barely any progression happening with this game. The charts are just terrible. The peak of players online is 267. And that was probably back when the game was released. Well, I loved the small community here but this game is simply going no where. Developers don't listen to the community too much. They add cosmetic items when there are SO many bugs, like not being able to play with a wireless card, or everyone lagging because there is 50+ players on. The only person I see helping this community is Jethro Tull, and he's not even a developer. I REALLY loved this game, I really did but it's time to move on. And I hope all of you do because at this point, Spearhead Games is just wasting their money. Now, if any improvements happen, I'll change my mind but until further notice. Goodbye ACE.

												The game has a lot of potential to turn into something great on the indie scene, the devs are taking ideas submitted by us the players and taking them onboard which is great, right now the game is very bare bones as you'd expect with an under development title in its early stages, it still needs some core basic features to get it going like sound and a way to communicate with team mates along with some A.I partners for when your unable to get into a match with players but the focus right now seems to be on stability of connecting to match servers so people can test the game which i would agree should be the primary focus to start off then add things like sound assets in to make it a more enjoyable experience.I never had issues with frame drops or connecting during my 2 matches but i did see a few people chopping about the screen so i guess some peoples rigs are finding it hard to cope. I'll be following the development of the game to see how it progresses and will edit this accordingly to reflect the changes made!			",165,10,1,9,5,0,18

YouTube™ Video: Arena Cyber Evolution - First Look 

			Views: 401		

			Arena Cyber Evolution Review / First Impressions about the new MOSA (Multi Online Sports Action) also the game is known as ACE and you can play the game here -...		

Cool ConceptArena Cyber evolution is somewhat interesting game as a concept, but i feel a bit that the game lacks certain depth in order to be a bigger title than it currently is. Sure its still early access game and its not finished. I Like the mechanics of the game since its easy to get into and there is not that much difference between the characters except their abilities and overall stats.After all its a Free To Play title i think for that it aint half bad, but ive witnessed some issues with connection, but that seems to be bit better than it used to.

Early Access Review
								I like Arena Cyber Evolution a lot, I think its one of the best ""sports"" games out there, even at the stage its at now. I dont think I have ever seen a better candidate for an e-sport. and while Arena cyber Evolutions sure does not pull it off now, I bet that it would if the devs got the funding to do so. It may look it but Arena Cyber Evolution is NOT a MOBA, it does not play like a MOBA and nce you get in game you will see it doesn't even look much like a MOBA either. My only issues with the game so far are that there are not many characters and the characters they have are a bit grindy to unlock. there are no servers for the game its mostly peer to peer, so rage quits are a problem at this point in time. There is also only one arena or map currently to play on. It is lucky then all these Negative aspects described above are addressed in the stretch goals, with certain amounts of funding they will be adding more content and things like servers, and voice acting. The developers also have stated that they will be adding new characters every few weeks after launch, I dont know how this will turn out yet, but I am hopeful.I think this 3v3 Sporty action game is most definitely worth your time, and I recommend you play it if you are a fan of any genre, its got that wide of a net. The game play is addictive as well so you might just feel hooked! There are not a lot of layers in game yet, so if you like Arena Cyber Evolution be sure to spread the word. This game is a game I want to see successful.			",374,143,14,85,57,11,89

								1st impression of ACE.Not the prettiest game in the world...But and its a big BUT this game has a lot of scope to be a clasic.  Sure player numbers are low right now but thats not the games fault thats just marketing.I spent ten solid hours in one sitting playing this and although few in number the guys who have played this for a while seem very nice.  No noob abuse and when I pointed out that they were hard to match due to their upgrades every one of them dumpped their upgrades and went vanilla for me, can a noob ask for more.I would suggest downloading this and spending a few hours playing.  Would i spend money on it in store? I dont know yet as I have a rule about spending on F2P games. If you can get everything via ingame cash that you can with $ and $ gives no advantage then ill pay but i have not played enough to assess this as of yet.Overall first 10 hours I'd give 8/10. Lost marks explained below.-1 :No in match chat or voip so for new guys or ppl with no 3rd party voip coodination may be an issue.-1: Matchmaking at this time can put noobs in with tooled up vets making for some very unbalance play if the vets dont realise you are new or just dont care and keep their boosts active. ( this may be due to player numbers however so take this one with a pinch of salt) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Three-on-three ice hockey with a roster of robot players who are like MOBA heroes: Each with different strengths, weaknesses, and special moves. Like a MOBA, you acquire new heroes (called ""runners"" in this game) with real money, or in-game currency you have to farm. Everyone starts with two runners: A forward (the player that tries to score goals) and a keeper (the player that tries to prevent the other team from scoring goals).Matches are only three minutes long and the matchmaker puts you in with bots if it can't find other players (which is often). Figuring out how to pass and remembering to keep your opponents covered is actually harder than figuring out the controls. After the unavoidable first impression that the game would be easier with a dual-analog controller, you'll quickly become an ace with the mouse-and-keyboard setup.Beautiful graphics, cool heroes, catchy music, easy to learn. All it really needs is a bigger player base.			",49,2,0,3,2,0,1

								Before I downloaded this I was a bit skeptical, as I've not seen a game quite like this. Before I continue, I  do not like playing/watching sports, I do not play any other sports games. You can fall in love with this game without having to like sports, and get the team-work feelingof sports. If you and your team are working together above all else, you can be unstoppable.This game is amazing, and the dev team is awesome ^.^ pretty easy to contact them if you ever need to.The only downside to this game is that not enough people try/play this game! Everyone that does play it loves itSo, grab 2 of your friends, download this awesome free-to-play game, and go dominate the Arena, tell all your friendshave 3v3's with your friends, randoms, or bots. Grow with the community and help shape the game.Now finally, this game has a competitive side, and this is what really strikes me. Every sunday they have a tournamentwhere they shoutcast matches and pit the dominating against eachother, you don't have to be a certain level to enter, you don't even have to be good but these tournaments are an amazing experience to be able to enter with your friends.I recommend this game to all gamers.Oh and hey, you grab this game and realize your a natural and just wreck everything, give me a message and maybe you can join my competitive team ;P			",126,15,0,17,21,1,18

								+very fun+quick 5-10 minute games, perfect for a quick match before going to class+not terribly difficult at first, but player skill is very relevant+unique characters(which they will hopefully, most likely add more of) each with their own powers to help them in their main role+characters tailored to specific roles (goalie, interceptor, etc) but you can still play whatever character in whatever position+team work is very important, because you cannot  hold the puck for an unlimited amount of time, this requires you to pass to a team mate+the graphics are very good, reminds me of borderlands with the cartoonish style+bots are similar in skill to other players, behave like players would+free to play+NOT pay to win, you can buy hats and cosmetic with the spearhead points(points you buy with real money) but they also sometimes drop in chests you get when leveling up (i got a dark employanator skin for my negociator this way) other charactes can be bought with money bought or earned in game, and upgrades can only be bought using the earned in game currency+active devs working hard to improve the game as well as add new content-very small community, most of the time when I log on, there are less than 10 people online in my region, and the most i've ever seen online would be maybe 40-50consensus: download this game, it's free, it's fun, and the community needs to grow and the devs could use your support			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is a very simple, fun and challenging game that you play 3v3.  It's reminds me more of ice hockey than it does soccer, but either way, it's a blast with the different combinations of toons you can choose from, all with differnent roles and abilities.  I applaud it for the easy key management (wasd + space + mouse).  Only two special abilities per toon, so it's not DOTA on ice and it allows the gamer to focus on teamplay.  Also, the matches only last 5 minutes apiece, so you're not bogged down in a long game. I really hope this one catches one.  Also, as a free-play game, it doesn't try r@ping your wallet for upgrades.  Easily obtained through playing, especially if you play as a team.  Great job devs!  Good luck to you!!

								This is one of the few games in the steam free to play section that are definately worth your time and support. Some may be turned off by the aspect of early access but spearhead games has the best communication I've currently seen with an early access title. With developer streams happening every weekday and them essential using those streams as a Q&A session, it gives the community a very effective way to view the upcoming developments of this game. For example on August 18th this game was released on steam free to play, and by August 21st the development team had patched the game to include some features that the community requested via the stream. Aka bots when a person leaves a match etc...This games has incredible potential as an esport once dedicated servers are put in place and I highly suspect this to become one of the main esport games of the future with the right support. Which is important since the esport field is heavily saturated with MOBA titles with little else combatting it's popularity. I hope this game continues to go down the road it's taking, as it is a beautiful one.			",133,27,9,8,10,2,9

								This game is great. I was sketchy at first being a ""sport"" game but holy crap do i love this game. You can expect a nice community and a ton of new updates to come in ACES far future. Ok first off this game is not pay to win, how do i say this this game is a play to succeed game. You need to work hard in the game ensuring that you will work hard for getting new characters, upgrading implants, or getting something cute for you characters like a hat. YOu can expect alot of new things in the games development. Do i recommend this game yes 20/20 this game will do me good for a long long time.			",53,9,3,8,1,0,3

												This reminds me of Worms when it was first released back in '95, because at first Project Cyber looks very simple and not visually impressive. But Spearhead Studios has captured something here which is very, very rare - pure and simple FUN! Without any fancy visuals or complicated controls they've somehow got the core of game that has that 'just-one-more-game' factor and is very enjoyable to play. Given time to polish the visuals, give the game some more personality and refine the core mechanics a little more and this game could easily enter into video game nostalgia for tens of thousands of players. It is great to finally see a developer make an effort to create a non-violent game that is still competative!Give it a chance when you have 10-15 mins with nothing to do, you will not regret it.

								This game has been by far the best free to play game that I have played on steam and it is currently one of the few that I am actually continuing to play because of the community and the continual support of the developers.  This is a long review with a general pros and cons list at the bottom, if you wanna hear me ramble feel free to read but check out the botttom if youre scrolling through and want a quick synopsis.About myself: College athlete with a huge interest in sports and gaming is one of my favorite hobbies.  I enjoy MOBAs such as LOL, DOTA2, and Smite and play them frequently while also enjoying shooters and strategy games.  Honestly sports games havent held much time with me simply because they are $60 new each year and the community disappears immediately for the new version and while fun it gets expensive.  I downloaded this as my weekly free to play game (Cause I want to try new games and see what catches my eye) and got stuck playing all night.  I wanted to beat the bots and after a while I did, I ran into some humans too on occasion and that was even better.  I got my brother and a friend to get the game and now we are competing in the first esports season for this game on Team Shadow Fox (hence the [SFX] tag)  If you see this review, feel free to add me as a friend and I will have no trouble playing with you if you need a teammate or just have a question about the game.About the Game:  Currently it is 3v3 airhockey/icehockey fused with the idea of a MOBA.  You are able to select from a small pool of champions/characters/runners which are given a  couple of abilities to work as a team and outscore your opponents.  Game time is a short 5 minutes so you arent deeply committed to anything and the que times are only 1min long maximum.  There is no pay to win element of this game as the ""real money"" currency is meant for asthetic skins or hats or unlocking a runner early.  There is a regular in game currency used for picking from ""implants"" that can help customize your champion from improving his speed, defense, offense, or supporting your teammates.  The in game currency with enough grinding will also certainly unlock champions you are hoping to play.  There is also a free champion rotation to help players try them out and buff their champion pool.Roles Currently are simple and the champion pool currently has 8 runners in it with more on the way.  Strikers are designed to be fast and add power to their shots.  Supports are designed for passing options as well as to buff their team or debuff their opponents such as speed ups, slocks, dislodging the puck.  And of course the goalie who has abilities to help keep the puck out of your own net.  Hopefully as new champions come out the strategies and playstyles will be as complex and diverse as one could hope for.The Community: By far the reason I enjoy this game so much right now.  First off, how frequently are you going to be able to speak to the game developers of some of the bigger companies like Riot or Blizzard and actually get a solid response?  The developers will talk to you, get your opinions, tell you about upcoming game builds or runners, even friend you on steam.  One even helped troubleshoot a graphical error I was encountering in one of the early patches this year.  They are hard working and are continually working to improve the game and its player base all while having fun too.  I know the game is still young, but I know these guys wont abandon it and leave it in the purgatory that is early acess alpha games.They hold very frequent events and tournaments which is great for meeting other players, testing your skill and watching some of the best teams go head to head.  It adds the fun competitive edge without going over the top.  There are weekly mini tournaments with which to compete in that are low stress and fun while on the weekends there are solo player and team based tournaments which are designed for the serious competitors and the best players will compete in these.  Oddly enough this is how I got roped into the game when I followed the twitch stream and some of the best players in the game (Hypnos and Pit) brought in a guy with less than 10hrs play time into what felt like a pro event.  It was a lot of fun and nobody was too upset or frustrated with how lousy I was and we still came out ok.  On top of that Spearhead games has a dedicated sports caster Jethro Tull who will make you feel like your actually at the arena.  Finally all of the players who frequent the game all seem to be chill individuals who have no trouble helping out a new player, like new ideas, and are generally fun to play against.  They will tell you gg and actually mean it.My final Pros vs Cons listPros-Free to play and not pay to win-3v3 team competitive experience-Short time comittment ~5min-Well designed and balanced characters (Devs will make balance changes)-Solid repeat player base-Competitive tournaments and ranking system-Decent soundtrack (repetitive after a few games though)-Player base is friendly in game-Devs listen and care both in forum and in streamed events and personal message even-Devs will create runners based on fan suggestions (Obviously it needs to be feasible and balanced but it has happened)-Community appears to be growing if only slowly-Great game for groups of friends (Ideally 3 or 6)Cons/What needs to improve-Small player base (outside of events its tough finding a full match if you are solo, although this is improving)-It's alpha so still a glitch here and there, mostly graphical, nothing debilitating-Small Champion Pool (New game so its to be expected and it should grow)-Ranking system is not necessarily tied with matchmaking system (New patch just came out, but currently there is nothing thats going to stop you from being matched with the weekend warrior if you are new)-Ranking System is ELO which means its a solo player rating for a team based game (Currently this is the only feasible option, there arent enough players for a tiered system like LOL or Smite and this system will minimize the damage if you do get matched with a pro on your first day out)-AI is nothing special, they look for straight line passes and shots even if it across the middle of your own goal with the other team in the way.  If you have a full group there is no issue, but if not dont expect the bots to be carrying your butt to victory.Finally any issues you do have with the game, the devs want to hear about them.  Post in the forums, pitch ideas, visit the streams during tournaments.  They will answer you, other players will answer you.  Graphical glitch, they can help.  Need friends to play with, I added 4 friends this week cause I posted I wanted to develop my sunday teams roster.  The best thing you can do for yourself and this game is to download it, get two friends to download it, play together and compete.  You wont be disappointed and if you are say so and check it out the next patch.			",80,2,0,2,4,0,3

								First off, forget all the hype and marketer-speak. Will Arena: Cyber Evolution be the next big e-sports craze? No, there's a 99% chance it won't. MOBA-like champion logic? What does that even mean?Cyber Evolution is simply a 3 on 3 ice hockey game in space. That's it, although there really isn't anything wrong with that. What is wrong is that the controls are ponderously slow and floaty, and the puck is lost all too easily in the flashy graphical effects of special moves and players clashing at the goal. As for the community, it's currently extremely small. Prepare to play with and against a lot of bots. Despite Cyber Evolution's problems, I would recommend giving it a try. There is some fun to be had with it, and if its wrinkles are ironed out, it could become significantly more interesting. As it is now I'd give it a solid B-.			",10,1,0,0,0,0,0

								This game is better than a turtle eatin' turkey sh*t.  no foolin' either.+ games last 5-7 minutes+ stupid easy to learn+ stupid hard to master+ free to play+ can't pay to win+ vaguely resembles a sport but with players who make fun of your mother when screw up. actually wait thats just like a real sport- the main commentator on their channel at twitch.tv/spearheadgames isnt very good.  He keeps talking and wont shut the hell up. But at least they cast every day and have a bunch of tournaments all the time so theres that ;)- Sometimes I forget what my wife looks like but I keep playing anyway- after every game you look at the clock and think to yourself ""ok, ONE more game"" and then eventually you lose your job- turns out everyone was right about my mother9/10 - would download again			",80,26,2,23,58,3,12

								Its very sad to see games like this die...This is hockey game which has around 10 different characters. Each character has 2 different skills, and some characters are more suited for goalkeeping while others are for scoring goals and buffing the team. Its 3v3 game where either one of the teams has to score most goals in order to winPros:- unique and gorgeous setting, it reminds me of Galactik Football cartoon so much- beautiful graphics- great sound effects- devs care about it and stream every week- you can get shop items by leveling up- if game doesnt find other players in time, you can play versus botsCons:- very small community- bots are very good at goalkeeping			",436,109,20,79,48,7,66

								This game is really great. I don't know any other way to put it. You know you are having a great time when your heart is racing during the game, and afterwards you still can't stop shaking. For anyone downloading the game for the first time, let me start by saying that as of right now, going in at a random time and clicking play to find 5 other people is very rare. It may be discouraging and feel like a dead game, but it is very much the opposite. Instead of deleting the game or never playing it because you can't find full games, watch the streams, go to the forums, and get help from a community member. Tournaments are almost daily, and pick-up games are very often. Finding a team is usually not too hard, and you can make it easy by inviting some friends to come play.Essentially, the gameplay is just 3 on 3 hockey like matches, set in the future. There are a number of different runners designed to fill certain roles on a team, each with different speeds and abilities. Even though there is currently not a massive amount of runners, I am yet to get bored of the intense and exciting matches. There is no story/campaign mode, and the entire thing is a multiplayer game. If a player ques and finds no people or only a few (as happens often) then bots will fill in for the missing slots. Most players like to focus on a single runner to excel at, but once in the character selection nothing is holding you back from choosing any of the characters you have unlocked (all characters can be unlocked with in game currency, or real money, but please, do not get the impression that this is a pay to win game. Certain runners are stronger than others but every single one can be played well, and no runner is too far unbalanced.) The matches are a short 5 minutes long in an arena with each team trying to shoot the puck into the other teams goal.The community for this game is awesome. Its very friendly, and alot of the members have almost the entire community on their friends list at this point. The community isn't very large at all, and alot of the players in it have been playing since the start, but you get to know everybody this way, making it really great despite the sizeHonestly, this game has so many flaws currently, despite so many already being fixed. Lack of players, bad bot AI, bugs, balancing issues, and various other things all pull this game back. But i think it says something that even amidst all these problems that on other games would be enough to make me quit, this game has kept me coming back for more.Seriously, check out this game, and remember, don't feel discouraged when at first you can't find anyone.

								It's like a chopped-down NHL game with comic-book cyber-fi competitors.  And it's awesome.The game's simply a blast.  Rather, it's fun in its own simplicity.  You control one of three team mates (decently effective bots or players take the other slots), and a disc-puck-thing is dropped between you and the opposing team (where it is placed, precisely, is determined by last goal scored).  The teams rush for it, and use their unique players' abilities to snatch, slow, and stop the puck-handler.  Goals can be made by either dunking/running for a touchdown (run the puck into the net), or by shooting it in.  The grab-release mechanic allows for quick execution of shots, and easy interceptions.This is still a very young game, so as long as the core components aren't messed with and there is some major (and I mean major, as far as the magically-laggy home screen is concerned) MAJOR performance issues addressed.  Personally I feel this game should run just fine for everyone, but for some reason it hates my (more than adequate) graphics card, and pretty much any time I'm not actually in a game (where there are zero server side or client side latency issues), the graphics seem to progressively drop the framerate.  It almost feels like their fog effects don't ever fully dissipate and just stack invisible particles, or something.tl;dr Try it!  It's free, and it's fun!			",227,34,3,36,14,0,26

Some Pros and Cons i've noticed so far:PROS:- Fluid and familiar control scheme, easy to learn, hard to master- Short but quick and exciting matches that never have a dull moment- Shows good potential character customisation- Different characters each with their own strengths and weaknesses- Unique abilities for each character- Enviromental effects that switch up how you play on the flyCONS:- Bot AI that fills any empty player slots its extremely naive, often doing nothing or scoring own goals- Personally would prefer a 4v4 game mode along with 3v3- Community needs to grow to avoid the awful Bot players Hopefully this game gains a good following, it deserves it already.

								I dont review games too often, espcially early access but I felt that I had to say something about this one. Although it's still got a bit to go before it can be considered complete (very few champions to play as right now) but if you are looking for a MOBA that is very unique, pretty much in it's own genre then try this one. The community is growing but super helpful and there are tournaments going on a lot.What sets this one apart is the gameplay, it is sports themed with scoring points in mind and with that comes some very exhilirating gameplay much like you would see from watching an actual sports game. This game is definitely worth a try.			",81,7,1,22,12,1,3

												It's a really fun game, similar to hockey or soccer I suppose but with unique characters and abilities. Small community and often hard to find  a match. The devs are constantly working on this game and taking community feedback as well as streaming on twitch. You can get a free key by registering on their website, but it might take a few days. With the direction this game is heading, it will be even better.			",197,20,1,14,9,2,14

								This game is FRICKEN AWESOME! It's a 3v3 hockey game but it feels more like air hockey and each character has special power ups and ultimates! Fast paced exilerating game play that's a delite to play, even when you lose a match. Borderlands style graphics which is super cool, solid gameplay and tons of fun, all it's missing is more players, so please try this awesome free game cause it's totally worth your time!Purchasable items are aesthetic but you can buy characters with either real money or in game money, you can also purchase xp boosts with real money. You unlock aesthic items now and again as well. Anyways, back to playing :D			",76,6,0,6,7,0,5

								Great promise.Currently, the game is a bit lacking in features, and is still clearly fresh into the development, only really getting the aesthetics and mechanics of the game. Things are still missingly, like character balance and that creepy thing I assume is going to be an announcer still currently lacks a voice, so he just stares at you.The game has a fair few bugs, yet I can see the developers are just trying to make the game that -they- want to. Lots of heart is being put into this, and the actual gameplay is buckets of fun. A few games in and I was already getting stories I was willing to tell my friends with near misses and amazing goals.The biggest thing that picks my mind, however, is the lack of players combined with the bot AI. I am yet to find a full match, and most of the time I'm lucky to even get a 1v1, and not just me versus a lot of bots for the same XP. And the bot AI is fairly against the game, they seem to be the perfect player, and the difficulty seems only limited by how accurate the shot is going to be. They constantly are better then players at keeping the enemy from having the puck, and they have perfect teamwork, most of the time.However, even with these little nitpicks, I still find the game enjoyable, thusly, I recommend it.

								Spectacularly fun 3v3 game - I've been following the development stream/playing since Pax East and it's definitely one of the most enjoyable games I've played. Even just in this early build it feels very tight. The skill ceiling is gonna be very high, with a lot of room for creative uses of the powers + different class synergies.Very much a case of easy to pick up, hard to master, but anyone can be playing competently within a round or two.Also, the devs are pretty much the best people. Play this! Love it! Brace for giant changes because it's changing literally every day!+100 points because the devs are actively working on this all the time, it won't be one of those ""early access"" games that just stays half-baked forever.

								This is my first day on this game but i know that i already like it. ACE is funny, dev are present and people playing on it are very sympathic. Moreover it's a real F2P - You can buy some characters - and hats- but you can't buy advantages in game. What else ?			",37,4,2,4,12,1,9

								Definitely one of the few games to look forward to!Please fix the matchmaking or w/e since I only spotted 2/3 souls in Asia server only to be disconnected once game has started.I think there's some bug with the Client side hosting...Something similar to COD's NAT problem and Gunz's 999 ping issue.

								*Quick note - I see a lot of reviews on here with like 0.3 hours played or less. My teammate clocked in 146 hours and I'm over 50 so perhaps ignore the positive reviews that show the person installed it and ran the title screen over people like me that actually put some time in. Sadly the fact this game is even still listed on Steam reenforces the feeling that over the last 2 years Steam has gone from a solid platform for good games into an unchecked and uncontrolled shovelware factory for novice made indie garbage.Funny a friend introduced me to this game maybe two years back because he was friends with one of the devs. Comically over time said unnamed dev grew tired of some of the BS going on with the leads decision making which becomes a large part of this review.When I first played the game it was actually fun. There was a lot of potential despite being extremely rough. I was part of one of the first teams to play the game for cash as competitive eSports players, something I hadn't done in a long time. However despite the potential the net code alone made even simple practice with teammates brutal if not impossible.We gave feed back, the team ignored it. Each release the game got worse and worse with a clear focus on skins, visuals and other garbage they planned to monetize rather than making the game work. Believe it or not the net code got worse as it became clear the team really had no idea what they were doing when it came to networking. So rather than fix the match making and network issues they changed the menus, added new sounds and other pointless crap that didn't matter because you rarely could join a game and when you did you'd probably get disconnected at some point anyhow.There were so many problems and I wrote about them on my teams website and various other places for the devs to review but jump ahead it looks like they gave up much like the majority of the player base who they alienated during feed back sessions and the tournaments they put on.All in all it's quite sad to have seen the potential and then to watch them flush it. More so it's incomprehensible they would charge you $208.96 even if the game was complete and rock solid. That's like three or four triple A games or a crappy beater car for an unfinished no name game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
