												This game requires a controller. This game is also really cool. A pure party arcade game where your goal is to smash up a room in various ways. There are secrets in... well basically every level I have played so far, and there are lots of levels to play.In short... if you liked crash mode from the burnout games, and want a different take on that idea, than this might be for you.
