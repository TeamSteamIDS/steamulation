												    I'l sum it up for people who don't like reading at the bottom. 	Honestly this game is fun however it needs some work. The game itself is easy to learn but right off the bat some of the main menu get’s confusing. The text is hard to read and the ranking system doesn't make a lot of sense at a glance. Playing it for a little bit longer i now understand the “match” and “tourney” mode, however I have no clue how the champion mode works. When I actually started playing it was difficult at first with the sensitivity set to the max in options as well as the sounds that was currently blasting in my ear. After turning those down the game got fun, blasting through the first ranks it then got more difficult. The power move was first overpowered but as the bots got more difficult there reaction time grew making the game great to train reflexes. With a few patches I could see myself playing this if I got board or my internet went down. If they added multiplayer this game would be fantastic. If you have a little spare money this game if worth it.Cons: starts music to the max volume           starts with sensitivity to the max           text is difficult to read           non multi player           gamemodes and ranks do not make sense at firstPros: Very skill based          Fun if you just need something to do         Bots actually challenge you at a certain level         Music and sound effects fit the game nicely          Little to no bugsPS: Please note that all cons can be fixed in updates but i'm not in charge of that ~seal ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
