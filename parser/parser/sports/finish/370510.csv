												Eh, I did find this game okay, so I would recommend this to others to just give it a shot. :)Marble Mayhem: Fragile Ball is just a casual, 2D puzzle game that really reminds me of one of the toys that have similar functionality I used to have. This game contains 100 levels that may seem easy at first, but some of them can be difficult, providing you rather quite a challenge. The way you play is that you move your mouse to the left or right to rotate the screen for the marble to move in order to get from point A to point B.But it's not something as simple as getting from point A to point B, you also have to maneuver through obstacles that comes your way. You would have to avoid hitting spikes that exists in some levels and falling down too far to the point the marble shatters. The levels shouldn't be too difficult, but if you don't succeed, try try again! The graphics and the game interface aren't really the best, but not like it really matters. Oh and there's trading cards too if you want to craft more badges.Should you buy this game? If you're just looking for a casual game, like 2D puzzles, or just wanting to make more badges from trading cards, then yes. Just give it a shot anyways! :)6/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The concepts for a solid game are all here, but this is very cheaply made, unpolished, and poorly balanced.Controls and physics are extremely sensitive, leading to you spending most of the game overcorrecting the ball's movement. I had to adjust the mouse sensitivity on a per-level basis. The mouse cursor leaves the game boundary when trying to whip the camera around too quickly. It's easy to accidentally click the mouse and restart the level. Everything has really basic textures, simplistic music, and stock sound effects. The game minimizes when you click away from it, which is  pain when trying to stream it.This game is playable in the most technical sense of the word. It could've been a fun experience with more time and attention. You might enjoy it if you're looking to beat an obnoxiously challenging game out of spite. If so, good luck!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Marble Mayhem Fragile Ball on PC 7.5/10Review after 5 hrs and 37 / 100 mazes completed.A little ball rolling around in 2D maze trying to get out by the door in the corner. And yet Marble Mayhem is so much more: Wild mazes with moving plates, gaps, skateboard ramps, spikes, water, and did I mention extreme angles? Sometimes this feels more like soccer. If the ball gets hit too hard - it shatters - start again…. Addictive.Mechanics:Moving your mouse rotates the maze and gravity moves the ball; the controls are tight and the physics are spot on. Mouse rotational sensitivity is adjustable. Patience with trial and error always pay off in games requiring the mastery of physics…. I did not rage quit a single time !Graphics are basic and audio is simple; both need polish.Full price on Steam seems rather extreme, but if you find it on sale you may be pleasantly surprised by this digital version of a childhood classic XDOct 2015			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Marble Mayhem Fragile Ball is a simple and intriguing 2d puzzle board game that reminds me of the original toys I used to play as a kid.Here is a link for anyone who is curious to what I'm talking about:  Marble Board Game [i.imgur.com]Pro-tip: if you have a mouse with DPI settings [en.wikipedia.org] then you will be able to fine tune the rate at which you tilt the game board, however depending on the level there is a hard limit to how much you can tilt the board one way or the other.The controls are fairly basic and simple:Moving your mouse left/right will tilt the game board level left or right and make the marble roll a certain direction.Clicking LMB will cause your marble to respawn.Scroll wheel will zoom in/out.Also another thing that took me a while to learn was how there are different types of marbles such as glass and rubber ones.If your marble falls more than a certain distance it may shatter when it lands (I believe this also depends on the type of marble and object it lands on such as brick/wood).At the moment I'm currently “stuck” on level 16 although from my experience so far I rate it a ★★★★ out of ★★★★★ for what it sets out to do, which is to be a simple – easy to pick up and learn marble game.

												If you like Super Monkey Ball, Marble Madness, or Peggle, those are actually good games unlike this one. Go play them instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Marble Mayhem: Fragile Ball is a casual game with 100 levels of diverse and ingenious physics based challenges. The first couple level is easy, but it will get harder, and harder with each level. Fun, and it remind me of some of the toys I had.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a hardcore casual game. Really, it is. No mistake will go unpunished, even the slightest one. If you are not into trying over and over again until you become perfect with you movements, you will not succeed in winning a level. However, finishing a level will give the player that rare feeling of accomplishment, of having achieved victory after a long and hard fight!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												'Marble Mayhem: Fragile Ball' is a nice little physics puzzle game. I recommend it if you like the genre. It won't entertain you for many hours but you can hardly expect that for this price. When the game's on sale it only costs a quarter, so you can count on at least getting your money's worth of fun, and maybe even a bit more than that. The mechanicsThe game is about getting a ball to a target but you don't control the ball directly. Instead, you turn the screen by moving your mouse left and right, which causes the ball to move. This ball, however, is fragile and breaks easily. So you'll have to avoid things like dropping the ball from great heights, dropping it on top of spikes or even touching spikes, leaving it underneath logs that come pounding down, and so on. In some levels, you can rotate the screen completely (360°) but in certain levels you can only rotate the screen e.g. 90°. This angle is clearly shown in the top right corner of the screen.Progressing in the gameWhen you finish a level, more than one of the next levels opens up. Say you just finished level 7. Coming back to the level selection screen, you may see levels 8, 9 and 10 opening up. What this means is that if you're stuck on one of the levels, the game doesn't have to end there for you but you can try one of the other levels and advance through that one instead. And you will find easier levels further on, even in the highest level numbers of this game. That's a bit strange but it doesn't have to be a negative thing. It means you'll be able to explore and try out all the levels of the game, even if you decide to just tackle the easier ones. If you prefer challenging levels, you'll find those, too. All the way up to what I would call 'masochistic difficulty'. Unless I'm missing something, I count a total of 83 levels. Music and graphicsThe music was ok. It fits the game rather nicely. And it's varied enough so it doesn't get on your nerves. If you're easily annoyed with basic background tunes, you can turn down the volume of the music and/or sound effects through the game's menu, or even switch them off completely. The graphics are basic but polished enough for a puzzle game. Check the screenshots to give you an idea. You can adjust the resolution and toggle fullscreen, AA and V-Sync on or off.Steam extras'Marble Mayhem: Fragile Ball' has 5 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 for running the game.The game does not have Steam Achievements, which is too bad. A game like this could really use them. There are so many games -especially puzzle games- to be played these days, so most people will just finish the levels they can finish and then move on. Achievements would have added some extra motivation to finish more levels.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
