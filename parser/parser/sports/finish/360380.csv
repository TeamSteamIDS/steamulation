""Cheese hungry mice in a 'World of Goo' bridge builder clone""First I was looking forward to play this game. I got it when it was reduced by 98% to 0.21 EUR. After playing the first levels I feel about this is not really a creative new concept of bridge builder game. Rather it's the same old overtaken principle of 'World of Goo': to build as less as possible triangles to reach a goal. The game proclaims to be very ""challenging"". But in the end you have the same problem like in 'World of Goo': There's only one perfect solution (OCD) to reach the 3 stars goal. Why to repeat the old mistakes I wonder. Couldn't it be a funny, not so challenging physics bridge builder game? But apparently the overstimulated kids from today love to sit hours over simple graphics to find the adequate angle solution that their bridges bendover in the right moment. Sigh ! Where is the fun in this?At least you have a hint option which refills for one hint / 10-15 min. Seems you have to ""hint grind"" through each level to unlock the ""collect every star"" achievement.PS. And the leaderboards are also pointless if you have just ppl doing ""hint solutions"".

												It's important to note that this review is based off the PC version of the game.Sometimes an App needs to just stay out of the PC market, and stay as an App. This is the only thing I could think of during my time with Ratventure Challenge. The games genre is a simple one, build a bridge and get object A to point B. There are many of this type of these games in the genre, I haven't really played many of them. Names like Bridge Constructor, World of Goo, etc, jump to mind, just to name a few. The genre has never really garnered much interest in me, it always seemed rather repetitive. With Ratventure Challenge, I thought it would be a nice, interesting, way to break myself into the genre.For the most part it does the job. The physics of the game can be a little strange and the game has some very odd design decisions, all of which we will be discussing here in this review. So lets start with something obvious. If you noticed at the top of this article, many prices are listed, ranging from five bucks to two bucks. Normally I don't list prices of the game on my blog, because I feel monetary value of a game is different from person to person. However in this case, I wanted to use them as a object point to a particular issue I have with this title. There is NO difference between the three versions of the game. Why is there a price difference? Simply for the pleasure of playing that game on that particular device? Now, I could ramble on about how this all seems shady but I will leave it at that for now.Straight from when you launch the game, Ratventure screams App. There isn't any retooling of options, buttons, or even the way you can interact with the screen. There are absolutely no graphics control or option menus present whatsoever. All you're left with is a sound off/on, music off/on button.The game also is stuck in 1280/720 resolution, if you wanted to play it on full screen, there is no in-game way of doing this currently. For a PC port this is rather disappointing in most regards.Now let's get to the good stuff, the game play. Now if you were to ask me simply, is the game fun? I would say yes, ignoring all the other issues the game has a whole. The game is simple enough to play, with you building small pieces in a massive wooden structure, in hopes of getting some delicious cheese. The puzzles vary in difficulty and sometimes not in order. One level is ridiculously hard and then the next will be rather easy. I think this issue has to do with the fact that Ratventure doesn't really evolve all too much as a game. There are buzz-saws and rope hooks to change things up occasionally, but for the most part your building pieces never evolve or change.Level designs are varied enough as you progress deeper into the games 72 levels and some of them can be quite the brain tickler. To help you along is a handy hint button that does a fairly good job of showing how to do it in the 3 star requirement. However, it doesn't let you do it step by step more then it shows it all at once and expects you to remember, this is probably done on purpose as it would be too easy otherwise. The game also features a useful ""Undo last action button"" that doesn't really work at all. The button only lets you undo the last action and sometimes not at all depending on what happens in the game. The game is full of these strange little inconveniences. As an example, if either of the rats die by some means, either falling or buzz-saw, you have to rebuild your entire structure over again, instead of just simply hitting the undo button.Why have this button at all?Designing structures isn't too difficult. The game does respond quite rapidly to commands and the structure dynamically responds to the changes you make. If one side of the structure is built upon too much, it begins to sag or bend. If the rats jump on the structure, the structure responds to the sudden shift in weight. Keeping the aforementioned effects in mind, works rather well and lets you plan out your moves quite effectively. One thing that did annoy me quite a bit about the game though, was the fact that the rats won't go after the cheese even if it's in their faces. You have got to build the structure on top of the cheese and move them to it. The rats are stupid, and won't walk on grass.Aesthetically speaking, Ratventure is just fine. The levels mostly change in color and the backdrop. Ratventure isn't certainly the most pretty of games but it isn't the ugliest as well, it gets the job done. I would have enjoyed a little bit of personality injected into the game. When the rats hit the buzz-saws they simply just fall off the screen. There could've been some added humor with them being ripped to bits or a funny sound effect. The game is just very monotone from beginning to end. Musically I felt the same about the game, while it never became grating on my ears, I never really noticed it or felt it was pleasant.There is no story nor sense of personality to this game. You just hit the play button and that is simply it. No little cut scenes or images to explain anything. The game does offer a fair bit of replay value in chasing down the mystical 3 star achievement. There really isn't much of a reason to do this, no rewards or anything unlocked other then steam achievements, you just did it. Congratulations.So you may be thinking I am coming off a bit harsh on this game? Keep in mind this was on the PC. I hold my PC games to a higher degree/standard and demand a bit more out of them. App games have the right to be simple on their platform, given the limitations of that platform. I would've probably been more than okay with all the issues and aspects to the game, had I played it on my phone or pad. However, the developer felt the need to make this PC port that is uninspiring and not very well done. Is the game fun? Yes. But is it worth it on PC? No. Get this game on your phone or pad, it's cheaper and you will probably enjoy it more as something to pass the time at the DMV.I only recommend this title, if its on sale, you really love bridge construction games, and know what you're getting. Otherwise buy it on your phone only!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ratventure Challenge follows 2 rats on their lifelong ambition to collect cheese. If you are familiar with physics-based bridge builders like World of Goo you should know what to expect. Six distinct worlds await, all containing 12 levels. Difficulty gradually increases either by giving you fewer blocks, asking for larger towers to be constructed or by placing more obstacles in your way.

			Ratventure Challenge PC Gameplay [60FPS] http://store.steampowered.com/app/360380 Steam Review: http://steamcommunity.com/id/seph_au/recommended/360380/ Focus on steam games, indies and early access.		

It's a shame to have to down vote on the basis of in-game transactions link. Because the simulation itself is quite good, as are the controls. While not required to progress generally both steam users and valve frown upon such things and they really have no place in full priced pc games.  Other downside would be the lack of in-game options, Music had no volume slider so it was either on or off and couldn't run in full screen, was locked to a window @1280x768.  Perhaps a little on the easy side I've not progressed far enough to make final judgement. With the in-game transactions removed and some video options added, I would give it the thumbsup as otherwise the price is about right and game is quite enjoyable. Cheers folks. :)EDIT:In-game purchases were completely removed by request. While the game still lacks video options it's not worth completely overlooking if you enjoy playing with physics or puzzle games. Developer has also apologized for the over-reaction and community banning me for no reason, these things happen.  Happy Gaming!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What do you get when you take elements of Transformice, World of Goo, and Poly Bridge (all of which being far better than this), throw them in a blender, and hit liquify? What you should have is a big mess, and that's exactly what you get with Tiny Bridge: Ratventure.First off, this is quite obviously a mobile port. I was first suspicious from the startup resolution, which is locked at 1280x768. A 16:10 resolution, and a failry odd one at that. ""Any options to change it or go fullscreen?"" You're kidding right? The options are almost non-existent, with your only real options being turning the sounds and music on or off. Not up or down, on or off. There's also a button on the main menu that gives a bare-bones tutorial, but we'll get to gameplay in a bit.Your goal is to get your two mice to collect the glowing cheeses by making a bridge, and using as few pieces as possible to do it. One interesting thing I will give this game is that you're supposed to use your mice as counterweights to help balance the bridge in question. ""Wait, aren't bridges supposed to be stable?"" Nevermind that for now! But yes. Sounds cool, right? You get to not only guide your mice to their goal, but make them be PART of the puzzle? Indeed, it does… it SOUNDS cool. Then you play it. And where do I even begin with the gameplay?First, if you want a three-star, perfect level, there's literally only one way to do it: the way the hint button tell you to, and verbatum at that. If you deviate by any considerable margin or try to do it your own way, you won't get the perfect finish. Even if you collect all the optional cheeses and use less than half the parts given to you, you'll likely only get two stars, max. The hint button also makes the leaderboards moot, as everyone can just use the hints to achieve the perfect score (and many of the achievments if they have the patience).Speaking of collection, there's a serious problem with hitboxes. Just look up screencaps of this game and you'll see that sometimes the mice will literally be touching the cheese but will refuse to collect it. ""Just reach out and grab it, you lazy cusses! D=<"" No, they have to be directly on top of it for it to count, and getting them to do that is a lot harder than it sounds.While on the subject of lazy mice, sometimes the tall thin one will refuse to move along with the short fat one, making me wonder if there's something wrong with me or if it's the game. Has anyone else had this problem, and if so, how do I fix it?Then there's the physics. Yeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh, they're not good, which is a real bad thing considering this is a bridge building game at heart. They're inconsistent, so much so that I've done the same thing several times in the same level and gotten different results. Tiny Bridge, you are not Bad Rats. Don't be like that.To summarize, do you remember those three games I listed up at the top of the review? Play those instead. Yes, even Transformice.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 About Tiny Bridge: RatventureThis mind-bending game will challenge you to create complex structures to get your woodland creatures over vast chasms. In a bridge-builder first, you'll guide your creatures and construct your bridges in real time. Use the weight of various creatures to balance your structures as you build them. Release Date: 8 May, 2015The Story You are the bridge builder helping two Rats get cheeze. It's probably the story of the century, lets be honest here. World of Goo didn't have much of a story either, but they had some existential thing going on in the background at least. I could weave a crazy story about how Top-Hat-Mouse is an entrepreneur that is venturing with his friend stocking-hat-mouse to invest in the cheese market.The GameplayThe gameplay is straightforward, but agonizingly difficult at the same time. You put down points to create a bridge for your mice to run across to get cheese. At that description alone someone could easily say ""okay, why don't I just play world of Goo instead? What does this game do differently?You can tell your mice where to go, and THAT actually goes way farther then you might at first thing. This means you can control where the weight goes before hand; unlike in world of Goo where the goo simply goes to the closest point to the end goal.All in All  Tiny Bridge: Ratventure is a good Simulation Game!9/10 From Me Sweep ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Update: The developer was very responsive, and pushed an update shortly after I delivered a crash log. It appears to have fixed the issue.As for the game, it's much like World of Goo and similar tower-building games. I kind of liked it, but I got bored easily.-----It crashes all the time on OS X 10.10.3 due to programming errors involving the undo stack (update: actually, settings) and null pointers.Looks like the programming is pretty awful, or the UI library is awful, or the OS X testing is sub-standard.

												The game is not innovative as the games with same mechanics exists for some time to this time. It's a light copy of the World of Goo of similar genres that are easy to play but presents some original concepts and are anyway fun to play which for me is ultimate goal for every game. The price is a topic to argue, but It's steam and everybody can wait to discount.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

-Quick Review-Tiny Bridge: Ratventure (Or ""Tiny Ratventure"" if you have a chronic condition of nick-naming or incorrectly reading names, like I do) is a physics based puzzle game developed by Estelion, and released in 2015. I feel like this is a tablet game that got lost and found it's way on steam.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: You are the bridge builder helping two Rats get cheeze. It's probably the story of the century, lets be honest here. World of Goo didn't have much of a story either, but they had some existential thing going on in the background at least. I could weave a crazy story about how Top-Hat-Mouse is an entrepreneur that is venturing with his friend stocking-hat-mouse to invest in the cheese market....But that would just be cheesy.

Gameplay: The gameplay is straightforward, but agonizingly difficult at the same time. You put down points to create a bridge for your mice to run across to get cheese. At that description alone someone could easily say ""okay, why don't I just play world of Goo instead? What does this game do differently?You can tell your mice where to go, and THAT actually goes way farther then you might at first thing. This means you can control where the weight goes before hand; unlike in world of Goo where the goo simply goes to the closest point to the end goal.


Uploaded for the Review - The trick with this level was to build a tower, then move the rats left and right to keep it from toppling over.

Conclusion: I would describe this as an ""Encore"" to World of Goo, but not quite as charming, it was clearly inspired by world of good, and mechanically speaking it's pretty solid. There was just something about this game that didn't quite connect with me. But that's not enough of a reason to give it a negative review, it does what it promises it goes on sale often.If you wanna play a game similar to world of Goo, and have a little money to through at it, it might be worth a pick up.

												Are you always asking yourself: ""What will happen if I mix -Canyon Physix Deluxe- and -World of Goo- and put some rats in it""? Well your questions came to an end now.This game is exactly what will happen.A game where you build via drag and drop a bridge to lead rats to their cheese.Not more and not less.Funny and Challenging.My advice: Don't buy the game, instead buy the bundle http://store.steampowered.com/sub/88338/ it costs less and you get 3 more games on top!It's also great to share with your kids via the Family Sharing system!

												Okay, so i'm not normally one to write a review, but this game has been an utter disappointment. It has sat in my installed steam library for a while now and I hated that I had never found the time to try it out.Well I tried it out, and after having to repair the game file i found myself with a tiny box on my screen, not full screen option, no settings of any kind besides the obvious sounds and music on/off switched. So issue one... no full screen, but who really cares, with a cheap boring knock off game that serves little purpose other than to occasionally work, it's the smallest of the issues. Maybe it is just my computer, I just finished playing some Xcom on max graphics though, so I doubt it's the hardware at fault with the game designed to require clever physics and specific timing froze more often that a 10 year old boy trying to talk to his crush. Maybe it was the hype, maybe I got too excited to check out a mediocre game, maybe it just wasn't meant to be, I spent an hour trying to play this game and less than half of that time was spent restarting repeatedly because of the crashing. This game... just... don't bother, not worth the memory used and the cost of the internet to download, even if you have unlimited.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
