												Trackmania Canyon is a really fun game, if you have ever played a Trackmania game you will find yourself at home. If online against others or alone, it is basically always you vs. the best time. There are no collisions, no agressive driving people smashing into you... just your own skill stands between you and the gold medal. ;)Highly recommended.			",415,84,25,40,52,4,66

												Let me explain something about this game. This game has a multiplayer that is NOT for the casual gamer. It is quite competitive, and it likes to display this competitiveness all up in yo' face. You WILL see that one dude (or multiple, I mean, they're everywhere) that can finish the track in half the time it takes you to finish it. I see this every other time I go onto this game.The game has a steep learning curve that requires at least an hour or more in order to learn the basic physics of the game. After that, there are tricks that, once learned, can help you set better times in the multiplayer. (i.e. Left-CTRL braking & using a controller.) The tracks in this game play a major role in shaping your skills, as they are user-created. They can go from being pretty basic to being some of the hardest tracks you'll encounter on your time here.I know very well that time makes all the difference in the multiplayer. In fact, it MEANS the difference. Times are what determine your position in a round, and the time is calculated in thousandths of a second, making photo finishes seem like nothing. You can set a record time in a single round, only for someone to beat you by .002. It really can be that close. There IS the odd tie, but it doesn't happen that often.Now, you should go into this game knowing that you're not gonna win your first race by a long shot. Practice makes perfect. It blends in the arcade-style driving physics and fantasy environment with a competitve multiplayer that stands with some of the best. I've never been so involved in a racing game that isn't a sim. Trackmania 2 also has its own ladder system, which determines how well you do amongst other players worldwide. And we're not only talking worldwide, either. It can track official progress to as close as your own state (if you live in the US, that is). You have a number for everything, from server rankings, to single player rankings, to country rankings. The better you do, the more the number goes down, and the more accomplished you feel.I recommend this game, because it makes the $20 you'll dump on this game worth the cost. Now, do mind, this was a game that was made BEFORE the UPlay era, so it doesn't require the UPlay launcher. Instead, it has its own launcher for launching titles, although it still is in need of serious revision. ",51,5,11,1,2,0,2

The game deserves more players but Nadeo/Ubisoft really dropped the ball by splitting it up, and refusing to lower the prices even now.

												Canyon is an arcade racer that consist of tracks that are somewhere between 20-30 seconds. You meet up online (or you can play against yourself) and everyone competes for the best time on each track. It's all about nailing those perfect drifts and jumps so you can shave milliseconds of your time. You can instantly restart at the push of a button. It's a very simple premise, but it's is insanely addicting. Tracks are short and easy to learn, but difficult to master. You need to cut each turn perfectly to win against other people online. You'll be saying to yourself: ""Just 5 more minutes, I'll quit after the next track."" And two hours later you're still playing. Highly recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Trackmania 2 doesn't offer a pushed calling mode, sensible tracks and stupefying gathering of available autos like other hustling titles. It has single-player substance, however Nadeo's continuation isn't wanted to be played alone. This is an establishment about sharing, about social event, and about dashing all through of this world circles in the wake of taking a snappy skip off an avenue lifted over a gap floor. It runs with a social occasion of force tracks, yet the certifiable delight of the redirection is picking through the get-together's appearances and ricocheting into servers to go up against others for smart times. Certainly, even so not long after dispatch, there's as of now a critical designate of substance there. On the off chance that you basically need to play alone, there are still a couple of things you can do. The included tracks have benchmarks worked in for you to go up against for changes, and if you're not a power racer the substance will set aside a long chance to open. Regardless of getting to the end of a parcel of the Black-level tracks can be a massive test, additionally fuming through at satisfactorily high speeds to get improvements. While the substance can enthusiasm to race through, the experience can feel genuinely devastate with just phantom vehicles to keep running with you. Thankfully there's a choice to stack in the soul autos of the replays of different players in case you're connected on the web, which drives a supposition rivalry moreover tip you off to better lines around the tracks. Playing on the web can be generally more fun, regardless, in light of the way that you can meanwhile fight and speak with others as you advance through the server's guide turn. Diverse techniques for play are open, however Time Attack is the one being played by far a vast parcel of those on the web. In it all players race over a length of track to post the best time. There's a general time control until the guide switches, and inside that breaking point you can restart as a significant part of the time as you need to record a middle of the road time and help your general arranging. You can see the autos of others as they race however there's no crash, which means you're set up to try the best line to the get done with paying little notice to what number of different players are pressed onto the track. Online preoccupations run an assortment of custom interfaces that show data like near to records, the present tune playing, the track name and client that made it, moreover live rankings as everybody sprints totally, which give a superior than normal layout as you speed along. The track changes for a couple of servers beginning now combine just client made tracks, which can continue running from truly standard, clear associations where the crucial test is to turn as valuably as could be allowed to more extraordinary game plans where you'll hit different speed cushions and go taking off through the air for extended time ranges. In multiplayer stimulations you're given a lot of unexpected beguilement as people around you pound into bars, miss the mark as for gigantic hops and crunch nose first into dividers, or flip end-over-end around sharp turns and off the sides of circles and slants. You'll keep running into relative pitfalls, the effect of which is showed up by the point by point hurt appearing on the autos. Replaying tracks for better times can in actuality change into a fixation in light of the way that most tracks take between 30 seconds to barely a moment to finish, so it never appears like one more lap will be a lot of a period obligation until it's four hours a short time later and you understand you neglect to eat. This is an arcade style racer, so it's unquestionably not hard to get and rapidly show signs of improvement than normal handle on how everything limits whether you're utilizing console or gamepad controls. Controls are clear, simply invigorate, brake and turn, yet there's essentialness to the managing as you comprehend how to utilize the skimming mechanics chronically major for getting a handle on tight changes without beating into a divider or losing a wealth of speed to braking. It's no essential accomplishment paying little regard to the principal controls, as keeping your auto level with the ground over the bangs, bounced and flawed turns of different tracks can be a shaky business. Without enough speed or certainly the right edge it's amazingly simple to end up moving over the gulch floor, however since such an unavoidable danger of dissatisfaction exists it's especially fulfilling when all goes right. Notwithstanding the way that each auto is in every practical sense obscure in Trackmania 2, you can skip into the auto head to re-attempt your paint occupation and create on a track. The unassuming bunch of included formats are all bolster enough, yet in the event that you require something without goliath Ubisoft logos on top of it you may need to contribute the imperativeness to make your own. You can then name and additional the auto and bring it into online rivalries so others can consider about your elegant limit or scorn both your auto's system and you're completing times. The moved track distribution director is astonishingly more strong, permitting you to shape as crazy a track as you wish with a degree of included building pieces. By burrowing through the toybox of grades, passages, S-turns and gorge pieces you can manage some truly imperative courses, an indistinct number of clients from of now have. These appearances are then shared between those in the Trackmania 2 accumulate. It makes a few additional strolls in the event that you need to pick particular tracks, yet it's a key matter of downloading records and setting them in the fitting records. You can then give them a shot yourself in a LAN beguilement, split-screen or in outrageous position modes, or disregard the entire creation point of view completely and simply welcome the get-together conveyed content interweaved into the track insurrections on your most treasured server. It absolutely doesn't hurt that Trackmania 2 looks phenomenal. The lighting impacts and appearance in your auto's reflexive surface are particularly phenomenal, and however the detail on the track pieces isn't decisively on near level, it barely matters as you zoom at high speeds through turns and over hops. To some degree more blend inside seeing the tracks would have been regarded, however the get-together is beginning now working consistently making exchange looks. What truly matters is Trackmania 2 goes on an empowering opinion speed, which adds generally more imperativeness to the experience. Nadeo's Trackmania strategy has dependably been about mixing arcade-style hustling with insane track design, and Trackmania 2 is the same. It empowers an over the top mission for the ideal dashing line however dazzling tracks. You can have a stunning time doing combating to be the speediest in a server or basically welcome the stimulate of taking off at fast crosswise over yawning split and tearing through circles. It's a redirection about social affair and sharing and Nadeo benefits a control of wrapping up the entire of the Trackmania encounter – neighborhood multiplayer, online rivalry, track and auto editors and general rankings – into one bundle. The failure felt through emphasized disappointments examining the crazy turns and touches of Trackmania's courses may put off a couple, yet without the risk of disappointment there could be no conclusion achievement. When you finally run a perfect line through a track to post a record time, every busted fender and yelp of anger is forgotten in a rush of sublime satisfaction.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time. In my religion, this is known as Art(TM), but you can call it ""T			",324,44,31,27,29,2,48

												Well what can I say? Trackmania is one of my favourite game series. It's a series that basically says ""Screw conventional arcade racing and your Need for Speed knock-off crap, we're doing our own thing."" And so they did. The gameplay is crazy, the difficulty tests your perserverence, the modes are fun, track-building is like a childhood dream come true, and it's very addictive. And this has been the same since the early days of Trackmania (2003) and progressively gotten better. So kudos to Ubisoft to holding onto what Nadeo set out to do in Trackmania 2. I'd definitely recommend everyone to give this underrated game a shot.			",39,1,6,3,2,0,2

												Canyon is most fun of all Trackmania 2 games. It is well designed, nicely balanced in singleplayer, and drifting here is like a dance. The game itself is intense, challenging and it requires a lot of tries on each map to reach higher position in local or global ratings. And that's very important. Competition feeling is one of the most powerful in Trackmania. All that matters - is your skill, and not how well you can kick opponents from the track.I really enjoyed it despite the fact, that there are 3 different games now instead of one: TM2: Canyon, Stadium and Valley.And I strongly recomment this one, it's very different from canyon parts from the first game.

The entire multiplayer experience is based on player made maps, and almost all of them are very good tracks.Overall it comes with endless possibilities, tons of races to enjoy, and a beautiful visual experience while doing so.

												This is a fun arcade racer with odd physics settings(including being unable to touch other cars. Easy to play hard to master. Most of the gameplay would come from racing on other peoples custom tracks or attempting to get times on the leaderboard in solo. The big seller behind trackmania is its map editor that has a lot of preset peices you will assemble together. The odd physics allow you to create crazy tracks, anywhere on the board for having fun or to have something challenging to beat. The game can also be very competitive with a leaderboard that can be viewed at local and international levels(You pick your location when you create your account and you will be a part of a set of regional to international leaderboards). The most fun i have is competing for the solo international records who get to have their posted to that track.What I liked:Compete Against Anyones Records- For every single track everyones best score is saved to the leaderboard along with a replay. You can select any of the records from the top players to your friends and add the vehicle to track to race against. All of the records you select will appear as ghost cars that align with your actions(reseting will reset them as well). You can use the top players ghosts to learn their strategies for the tracks and have a crap load of opposition to choose from.Solo Mode- The tracks are Divided into difficulties(represented as colours) from super easy to super difficult(and trust me when i say difficult it becomes extremely hard to even get close the the finish line). The difficulties are great for easing you into the easy driving to the crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥you will end up doing as the tracks slowly introduce harder and harder combinations of the track peices.Track/Map Editor- Very easy to use. All peices have interfaces that tell you what can connect to what. A large number of peices to choose from. The peices are now much more ""realistic"" in design and appearance/ They look much more natural. Once you start thinking outside the box in your design you will come to realize that actually connecting peices is not even necassary. Then you will start to make crazy courses.Physics/Driving- Like in the past for the trackmania series. Each of the themes use different settings of physics and cars that perform quite differently. The same applies here so your going to need to learn the unique physics. Simply driving is very simple however you will find the the courses you will end up driving suddenly the driving becomes difficult to master.Multiplayer- Generally the race types are time trails and regular racing. Time trials give you as set amount of time/laps to get a good time. You can reset yourself/return to last checkpoint at will. What the others are doing is irrelevant however you can still what they are doing. The regular racing is either a point to point format or an actual circuit. In these races you cannot reset your time. You can still return to the last checkpoint or the start, but your time is not reset. The order the playing cross the finish line is the final score. The matches will be ranked(solo tracks with hard rules and full leaderboard support)Low System Requirements/Graphics/Performance- The graphics are not really great or anything special. They are an improvement from the older track mania themes. Max graphics is laughable for a gtx1070 and when you drop them down many lower end machines can get playable performance. My laptop with a gt740 works perfectly well on descent settings. Game is well optimized as a whole as I haven't come across any issues relating to it.Perfect Balancing- Like the rest of trackmania everyones car is the exact same performance wise. You can only customize is paint scheme. If your not lagging everyone is perfectly balanced when it comes to the game itself. The gameplay consists of experience and skill.Unified Launcher- When you have multiple trackmania2 titles they are all accesible without closing the game you originally started.What I disliked:The is nothing in specific that really bothered me about this game, but just to clarify it is an arcade style game not a simulator in any way. There are no ways to modify the body or performance of the car. So if your into the serious racers this game might not interest you.Final Summary:I would recommend this game to anyone who races casually or wants a challenge. If you need to be able to change setting for the vehicle this game is not for you.			",146,10,13,11,31,0,53

												This game is the undisputed champion of time attack! The multiplayer integration is just so immensely huge. Servers have dozens of players on, theres a gazillion of maps, models and skins made by the community. The tracks in each environment are absolutely insane, but still the whole mechanics are so tight that u can tell each 1/1000th of a second that u lost or won during a turn. Trackmania always was a huge hit back in the days and the new installments absolutely lived up to my very high expectations....i sank tons of hours into the previous games. My thumbs were constantly numb and sometimes i shred one gamepad per month, maybe even more. It's just that good.Going for medals and challenging other players records is extremely rewarding. It's not an easy racer, the track layouts are very tight but the physics of the cars are absolutely tight and theres no surprise loss of traction and the like.If u want to check out the cool factor of Trackmania go to TM-Tube.com and check out some of the users videos...some of the stuff is just insane (in style, driving and trackbuilding alike.)11/10 its just sublime and awesome!!!!+edit:Since i read some negative comments about being only 1 car in the game. Theres a trackmania carpark online with hundreds of cars to download (also on the steam workshop) ...some car makers ask for some of the ingame credits...but most of them are download and play.Of course those car models only change the appearance and sound of your car..the handling and speed stay as the reference model to maintain game balance.

												Track mania hasn't always been on steam so I have many more hours than displayed. As far as arcade racing goes, the Track mania series from Mania Planet is very fun. Jumps, wall rides, loops, drifting, high speeds, no complaints, I can use a keyboard to race but prefer a controller for the joystick's sensitivity etc. Both the single player and multiplayer modes are very fun. Like other games, there can be less or more players online during certain times of day. The mutliplayer community is definitely active however. There are plenty of offline maps for single player with varying difficulties to complete for medals. The single player maps in order also can help develop skill. Playing online, the maps can be endless since new maps are continually introduced and cycled. Maps can vary a great deal, from simple to very technical (fractions of seconds count) but very fun. Ranking is tracked and displayed for single and multiplayer, locally and globally.It also has a level editor to create your own maps.I use the steam workshop for car skins and downloadable maps, a lot of decent content.http://maniaplanet.wikia.com/wiki/TrackMania_(series) ",150,11,6,7,6,1,3

												Trackmania 2 is an interesting game. It gives alot ""room"" for the player to customize the game to their heart's content. However, it's not that user friendly. But, after playing around with the features, and getting some good advise from some friends, I figured out how to customize it. The trailer shows them in a gran prix fashion. There's two ways you can do that. 1. Record many ghosts in the replay editor, or 2. rounds mode. I conclude that this game is one's who want a challenge.P.S. Levels A through B will be a breeze, then it's the hard stuff			",7,3,18,0,5,0,0

												Trackmania Canyon is more than your average arcade racer. If you're looking for the Quake of racing games, this is it.It's real time leaderboard incorperation into multiplayer servers serves not only as a visual clarification of your improvements over time, but an insentive to keep playing, and claim those tops spots. The UI is plain, simple and to the point, as well as being easy on the eye.The game boasts a singleplayer series of tracks that range in difficulty, with end-game content being hard to unlock, and extremely difficult without many hours of practise. You can do 'offical' runs every 5 minutes when practicing, which will upon completion upload your time to a leaderboard with the change to get SP or skill points, however internet connection is not manditory to play these.The game has a very long learning curve, with the player having to develop their muscle memory with the car physics, learning tricks that help the top players shave off those milliseconds. There a lot of flicking involved, that's for sure.The physics in the game feel wonderful, and have a very dynamic, full feeling; giving you a sense of complete control over your car. Something that many racing games fail to capture to this day. Combine that with a plethora of user created tracks - from technical ESL-styled and Speedtech courses to LOL and Mr DVD minis, each track potentially introducing a new way to take certain turns, making new tips and tricks to learn for every possible transistion, turn, jump; you name it.Another great plus to mention is the community with the vast majority of players being friendly, and willing to give you tips on how to improve your driving. A small percentage of the playerbase of the populous trolls, but that's to be expected for any online community, niche or not.If you're looking for something to get into that'll take you a while to learn, whilst having fun getting there, then this game is for you. Play for a month then look back on your first replays and you'll really see the improvement which is another great positive about the game as your progress really does show.The only downside about the game  would be the lack of a search option. Finding specific maps or replays is difficult when you've amassed a large library of either is difficult and time consuming.			",96,3,7,2,7,1,6

It is highly competitive and sees you racing as fast as you can on a huge number of tracks (plus Workshop Content to expand on this number) to score the fastest time! Gladly, though, it also caters to a more casual audience, allowing many fans of arcade racing games to pick this game up and enjoy it :) It looks great, feels great, and provides hours of entertainment!

												Here is THE best multiplayer racing game ever made.TrackMania is the game created by the community, the maps, the cars, the roads, the environment, all is made by the players for the players and that's the best point of the game.This is what makes this game different from the others, the players will change the game to enhance the techniques of driving for the competitions to be as impressive as possible. That's why TrackMania Stadium is one of the games listed in the Electronic Sports World Cup.And even though It's been 10 years since the first TrackMania got released, the game is quite empty but you will always find a server to play. However, the main problem of an empty game is that the maps don't change (in some servers), some people already played the maps around a thousand times when the game is about creating and sharing maps.If you never, ever played TrackMania, prepare hours of lessons of driving because this one is ""the new generation of driving"", you are a soap in the canyon, use water to make lather and then slide. The first time is always the hardest, but always the best. If I didn't like this game, I wouldn't had ever spent almost 3k hours of my lifetime playing any TrackMania since 2006.The price is worth it. Try it.			",269,51,20,20,7,3,6

												The original TrackMania games were damned amazing and had a great following with tons of servers full of thousands of players at any given time of day. For the last ten months, the new TrackMania games have been dead. I paid full price for all three titles, expecting to have an even better time with the new games, because why not?Well, as the days turned to weeks, I realized the folly of my wasted money as almost all of the servers remained dead across the planet and it continued to be impossible to find a choice of heavily populated servers. Whether it was the dumb choice to milk the players of their cash by splitting the game up into three separate releases (one for each environment) and requiring separate servers for each or if it was the decision to charge money for the new games, at all, the result remains the same -- nobody plays these.If you reference SteamCharts[steamcharts.com] for Canyon, you'll find that the average number of players at any given time through all of 2013 was between 10 and 100. Across the entire planet - and most usually seem to be overseas (Germany, France, Russia, Spain, the UK), so if you're looking for a populated low-ping server in your region and you're in North America, you're going to have a bad time.It's a very unfortunate situation. The game looks better than ever and it has a lot of enjoyment to offer if you like this style of game. It's a fantastic time waster when you need a break here and there. However, you ultimately need a player-base for a multi-player game to be enjoyed. Their business and release model for this series of games completely failed in this way, this time around.Here's to hoping they give the franchise another shot in a couple more years and they correct their mistakes.

												Out of the three trackmania 2 games out now, this one has got to be my favorite. To me it seems like you are able to do more with the car and map combinations than the other two, such as drifting and platforming. With this being the only one of the two that you can drift the cars in, it makes going around high speed turns atually more fun than a hassle, and  you dont lose speed while doing so. The platforming is another great part to this game. If you've ever played jet car stunts for android and ios, you'll quickly learn to love the platform mode. However when it comes to editing and making your own, to me at least, it proves a creative challenge that can be fun and rewarding if you happen to publish your courses to the community. Above all really, just have fun with it. It's not really ment to be taken seriously at all, like every other vanilla racing game out there (forza, gran turismo, need for speed, etc) If you get bored of single player, definately try out the multiplayer on the custom dezined tracks as well. For lack of a good conclusion, try the demo, you'll enjoy it.			",169,24,8,21,13,1,4

												TrackMania 2 is a really fun arcade racer.There is only one car but appearance is customizable.In terms of gameplay, this game is easy to pick up but hard to master.There are lots of intriguing tracks, each has its difficulty.I really enjoy the driving, especially watching the car flipping over and crashing into the water.The physics is pretty laughable once you're off the track.Watch your car endlessly flipping in the water, and watch your car somehow remains intact after hitting straight into a cliff.However, that's actually part of the reason why I enjoy this game so much.Instead of getting upset about myself after failing a track, I always burst out laughing upon seeing the funny animations.I would recommend you pick it up when it's on sale. It isn't worth the 20 bucks to be perfectly honest.			",260,60,36,29,32,1,51

												Trackmania Stadium was basically perfect. The real magic was in the nuance of control -- the ability to slightly alter your vehicle's rotation in the air by strategically tapping the brakes. Canyon throws that out the window and becomes a significantly more frustrating game for it. With the game's tendency to present you with massive jumps and ramps, you often have to leave it up to random chance whether or not you'll land correctly. The level of precision it demands from the driver borderlines on impossible sometimes. It's still a good game, it's just significantly more difficult and more frustrating than Trackmania Stadium.

												From my perspective, I found this game to be very enjoyable. + Exceptional Graphics+ Visible Damage without affecting handling+ Multiplayer: See others w/o crashing into 'em+ Mods available (I drive mainly a 911 or sometimes Sonic The Hedgehog)- Not as many players as free version of TrackMania - Lots of servers but player #'s stay around 30, on a good day- Bought game during a sale. Thought full price was too much.- While Single Player is straight forward, Mutiplayer has slight learning curveI got this game because I have a love for racing games in general. It's such a simple yet effective game. What makes me keep coming back is the multiplayer. Trust me when I say that there are some seriously crazy challenging tracks out there in mutiplayer mode and when the time runs out with you finishing in the top 3 or even top 10, I find it to be really rewarding.If this is your kind of game, then you should buy it. I recommend it.			",159,28,23,6,4,0,10

												Trackmania is my favorite racing game series... and I have to say that Trackmania2 Canyon is the best game of all Trackmania games IMO! Every Trackmania has the unique car physics and ""area"". In TM2 Canyon you have a car that can drift nicely and obviously the ""area"" is canyon :D. Multiplayer works perfectly and I always find games where is atleast 30 players. Singleplayer campaing is also pretty cool and what the best thing in this game is: you can make your own maps and download others' maps!!! You can do very basic maps or really hardcore maps, depends what you want :).. I highly recommend this game to everyone who likes racing games.And why don't I have many hours on this game on Steam?- Because I've bought this before it came on Steam and played 100+ hours it.

But if you use Norton Security it will delete the exe file for this game ever chance it gets, I have to disable Norton everytime I wanna play.

												It's the dullest of the three ""Trackmania 2"" packages, and the blocks/environment are a bit less inspired than the other two, but that doesn't mean this is a bad game.If you're a fan of the TM universe buy it! You won't be disapointed (if you are a fan i definetly recommend getting all the three packages).If you can only buy 2 of the three packages i suggest getting this and Valley, but if you can only get one i suggest ""Valley"".As standard from Nadeo, the game is perfect, and once again the track editor is the best one we could hope for.Amazing graphics, smooth gameplay, hard (as it should be), magnificent editor, vibrant community.A seriously recommended game.

												The Trackmania series is pretty much a league of its own.  The various games in this series (Canyon, Stadium, Valley*) are quite similar in structure yet still have their own gameplay.  Canyon, like all other Trackmania games, have simple, highly-responsive controls.  You do not need a steering wheel or PC controller to enjoy this!  Despite the simplicity of the controls, the feel of the game is much deeper.  Powersliding around corners and launching off of ramps seem easy at first, but you'll have to think twice about your performance when another user beats your time by 1/100th of a second.  The precision needed to beat other (human) player will make you drop your jaw --only to have it slam shut after choking on their dust.To add onto the play style game feels like it is trying to straddle hardcore precision as well as arcade (think Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit (2010), and it does a fantastic job at this.  Despite how frustrating it might be for trying to top the leaderboards, the game also has a little bit of a comical side; it can get very amusing playing on a server with 100+ other people and seeing many of them fall behind as you cruise on through.  ...  What?  100+ on a single server?  It is easier than you think!Within all gamemodes, even circuit, there is no worry of server lag because times are handled more on every computer individually and there is no running into each other at all, everyone can play at their own pace --heck, you don't even have to run the race to have fun if you choose to go running off the track for your own adventure.  As for playing against other people, the leaderboards are the best I've ever seen.  You can see where you rank amongst other people globally, your country, and even down to your state/province/region.  Plus, there are individual rankings for single-player and multiplayer as well.Hey, guess what?  I only told you what got me hooked on this game.  There is still more to Trackmania than what I have mentioned here!*Valley has not yet been released, even for open beta, at the time of this Recommendation.			",625,276,25,56,60,7,73

												I love the TrackMania series of games and spent many an hour on TM Nations Forever from release and after steam launch. So I decided to purchase the whole TM collection, starting with Canyon.And that's where the problems and frustration start. As the trend of negative comments show, the DRM of ManiaPlanet is terrible and far outdated. Firstly, it requires an always online connection, even when ""offline"" mode is selected! Secondly, my old account (and achievements) worked once and after that wouldn't be recognised (even after changing password). Waiting without a reply from TM support for over a week is not really professional and of course re-installing the game does not help as it now gives a ""key is in use"" error!?!All in all, TrackMania Canyon has many positives as an arcade racer (editor) but I cannot recommend a game which uses a third party service (ManiaPlanet) with so many problems and non-existent support. I've spent 30mins in game and over 10x times that scouring the forums (fora?) trying to resolve issues with it. If Nadeo isn't bothered improving their service to support their TrackMania titles, why waste any money on them? In the end I had to request a steam refund.-----TL;DR: TrackMania Canyon is a good fun arcade racer but be prepared to experience many problems with their ""always online"" 3rd party service required. I would suggest to download the free TrackMania Nations Forever and give it a spin ironing out any potential problems first, before splashing out on any of the paid titles. Good luck.

NOPE even though I bought a brand new one the key still conflicts.  Now i'm two games in worth of money and no multiplayer allowed.

												This game has absolutely terrible DRM. unless you are somewhere where you always have internet, pass it up. I have played this game before, but now I reinstalled it and it says my key is in use. Developers forums are no help, and the only suggestion I can find online is to email support and wait for reply. Totally disappointing that another game is ruined by DRM, legitimate users punished. I have no idea, but I bet the people pirating this game can actually play it, unlike me who actually wasted money and now cannot.			",219,27,10,6,15,2,36

												Easy to pick up and impossible to master. Cars are fast and stunts are big, and this of the other two environments stands out the most. Awesome online community, very friendly. Although this game could seem repetitive, it's presented I a way that makes it nowhere near repetitive. It may be the same cars with the same type of track types, but every individual track finds a way to make itself unique in its own way.The track editor has always been major I track mania games and this version of it is by far my favourite and the best of all of them. With the introduction of these new macroblocks, the possibilities for track creation are limitless. The editor doesn't require any experience, as the simplistic design makes it very user friendly.Graphics are incredible for a game of its time, and I may go as far as saying they are amazing still to this day. 10/10, incredible.
