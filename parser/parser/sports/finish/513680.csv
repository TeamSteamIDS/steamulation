												I am an archer myself, so I was really interested in this title.Before I bought the game on steam, I had already tried out the free version (with microtransactions) from the developers website to find out if I would enjoy this. What is this game?It is NOT a free ranging hunting sim like The Hunter. It is more like a very slow shooting gallery. You will not stalk any animals but wait for them to come towards your tree stand/ hide. Therefore this games requires quite a bit of patience. Slightly annoying is the fact that if you miss the deer, it is basically game over and you have to restart the level. This can get really frustrating. There is also some grinding involved of the easier levels to improve your gear.The levels become more difficult the more you advance and add extra challenges, to spice up the shooting gallery. I thought it was a nice touch that you can walk around the forest before the hunt and collect antler casts to earn extra money.The graphics are serviceable but basic. Nothing to write home about, but at least the animals are nicely animated.But, in some cases, the animals have slight pathfinding issues. I also noticed some clipping and glitches.In addition, the game crashed on me once while navigating the menu.Positives- very relaxing game. The forest sounds are nice and add to the soothing atmosphere. The game runs fine on my old labtop (even if I had one crash) and controls are straightforward. The animals are nicely animated.Negatives- gameplay can get repetitive. It also requires a lot of patience. If you are looking for a open world hunting sim, go with The Hunter (which has the downside of being very expensive in the long run). If you want more action, maybe try hunting in Skyrim or try out Carnivores Dinosaur Hunter (which is great for the price).If you are looking for a nice slow relaxing game, this might be it.My only criticism is that it is a bit overpriced for what you get. The price is a bit steep for a shooting gallery that does not allow you to shoot more than one deer and where you have to restart the level when you miss a deer. I also hope the developer works a bit more on improving the pathfinding of the animals and solves some of the glitches (when my character holds the GPS unit, my fingers poke through the GPS screen). Also, I had a crash when navigating the menu. If the developer fixes these issues and adds some more content (I would love to see a hunting recurve bow), the game might become worth it for the price.So yes, I recommend the game, with some restrictions. I especially hope for some updates and more content from the developers. If you want something slow and relaxing, this game would be worth picking up on a discount.Right now, the game is overpriced.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not worth the money.Spend it on theHunter.If you want a hunting game of any type this is the only one worth having.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Maximum Archery has actually been around for a while, and a look at the screenshots show it. By 2017 standards, the graphics are mobile quality at best. The Steam release is basically the ""retirement"" of the game's original model, which was free-to-play with microtransactions. The Steam version is meant to be a one-off purchase with all paid features unlocked, as the game's old servers are being phased out.The game is audaciously priced. It's not worth the non-discounted cost.And the game doesn't work. Launching the game presents a ""Loading hunter stats"" screen which attempts to connect to a server, resulting in an error and critical failure.Needless to say, I immediately requested a refund.See for yourself:

			I'm probably never going to be hunter, and you probably shouldn't buy this game. === Follow me on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/nusensei
