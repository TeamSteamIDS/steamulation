												I've played many many RPGs in my day. Starting with Wizardry games on the PC when I was young and onto Final Fantasy, playing the newer ones as they came out. I was a PlayStation girl so I played the Personas, Xenogears, Grandias, Shadow Hearts - okay, listing them all would take too long and is off the topic. But I want you to know how well-versed I am in this genre. :)Legend of Mysteria is the first RPG I've played on Steam that was obviously made using one of the generic RPGmakers and isn't a ""big hit"" game. I thought I'd give something different a chance. And I'm extremely glad I did.Now, it's listed as a turn-based RPG but it's really all about an involving story where you do some serious detective work. In all the hours I played, I fought only a little over 10 battles - half of those, bosses. There is no leveling in this game whatsoever. You have to find different equipment to bolster your stats. And you play as a mage so the trick is figuring out what your enemy is weak against and then finding a staff or accessories that allow you to cast the elemental spell that will annihilate your target the quickest.The meat of the game is interviewing everyone you can. Everyone thinks you're a murderer so you have to find the real culprit and clear your name. Of course, being that people view you as a killer, you must disguise yourself. You begin in a tower full of all different types of mages. You'll need to switch robes often to fit in with whatever group you're spying on. You also get different dialog choices here and there so think carefully before answering. Searching everywhere and everything is a must since you need those different colored robes, and reading notes and diaries on all the mages will help you find clues and point you towards those who might be willing to help you in your cause.I would say this game is difficult. The times I had to turn to a walkthrough, I would sit there reading it thinking ""who in the world would know this is what you're supposed to do?"" But the story was so interesting that I had to see it to its end. What you do during the entire game affects what will happen at the very end. It's just very neat.So in conclusion, this is not your typical RPG. It's frustrating at times and... no leveling? I'm  a girl who loves to level for hours so I can swat the last boss like a bug. In this game, I actually had to strategize my fights and manage my healing potions with care. :p  However, I loved Legend of Mysteria. I was never bored, the characters were interesting and detailed, and I really approved of the music selections they chose from the RPGmaker. The fact that I'm even writing this review at all says a lot because I don't really want to be doing this. I want to be playing! I just wanted you to know how much fun I had with this unique adventure. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Disclaimer: I was given a key for this game for free.Full Review (for my original Quick First Look just scroll down):Legend of Mysteria is a spin-off from the Labyronia RPG series and story wise a prequel. While there are a lot of familiar characters and the main area of the game is the so called Mysteria Tower, the story can be enjoyed on it's own, without any prior knowledge. However if you have played Labyronia RPG 1 and 2, Legend of Mysteria will give some nice additional insights. The main storyline, the murder of a high rank mage called Dinyon and Windir (the player character) trying to clear his name, while being accused of being the man behind the dirty deed, is a very well put together detective story that will keep you guessing until pretty late who the true culprit is.As I have already said in my First Look, gameplay wise is where the biggest different lies between Legend of Mysteria and the original Labyronia RPG games. While all 3 titles share their RPG Maker VX Ace foundation, the later are more traditional CRPG games with a quite a heavy focus on battles. Legend of Mysteria on the other hand plays more like a classic Point & Click adventure with hardly any battles at all and even then, there is no real RPG style character progression, XP system etc. This game is about exploring your locations, talking to NPC, gathering evidence, finding and using items to unlock new and previously locked rooms and areas. At this point it needs to be noted that even though I have played a lot of adventures in my gaming career (including most LucasArts Games and even more Sierra Games), I did get stuck quite a lot. This is not due to strange tasks to be done, but rather the fact the due to the absence of a quest log, the player should really start writing (I mean really writing with pen & paper!!) down notes. Thankfully to a kind player, there is a full walkthrough in the community guides section!In conclusion I can highly recommend this game to both fans of the series for the insight it shares to the lore of Labyronia, as well as to everbody looking for a RPG Maker game that doesn't follow the usual steps a RPG Maker game does take! -------------------Quick First Look:Legend of Mysteria RPG is a spin-off from the Labyronia RPG series; actually according to the title screen it should be called ""Labyronia Tales Legend of Mysteria"". Hence anybody who is familiar with the main series, will feel right at home, as there many characters one would have already met and familiar locations, only at a different time and with new content. This should not scare of newcomers, since it is an independent story that doesn't require any prior knowledge. Gameplay is where the Legend of Mysteria RPG seems to have changed the most, at least from what I have seen so far. It actually feels way more like a classic adventure game with RPG elements. In the beginning the player character, a mage called Windir, gets innocently accused of attacking and possibly murdering another Mage called Dinyon. Now it is time to find the real culprit and clear Windir's name. This all happens in traditional adventure game style, that is talking to NPCs, doing favors for them and finding ways to access new areas.What about the battles, you might be asking by now? There are battles, but unlike in Labyronia RPG 1 + 2, it actually will take some time until you will have your first encounters. Despite appearing to be easier now, simple attack spamming still won't get you anywhere - just don't forget that Windir is a mage!In conclusion I can easily recommend this game to fans of Labyronia RPG, because it is more Labyronia, even though it kinda feels different now. There are many characters appearing from the main series as well as well-known locations featuring additional content (new areas). However this should not turn off newcomers, as no prior knowledge is required to make sense of what is going on.NOTE: I will update this quick first look with a full fledged review, once I have finished the game.

A Prequel to Labyronia RPGThis game is about exploring your locations, talking to NPC's, gathering evidences, finding and using items to unlock new and previously locked rooms and area.Pros:• Windir's story.• Crime investigation.• Plot is really good.Cons:• Really hard puzzles & quests. (time-consuming if you don't know what you're doing.)• No XP system.• Annoying obstacles.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had hopes for this game since it's opening premise is interesting enough and though its made in the RPG maker the maps and items for the game where customized enought and look nice, buuuuut...The game becomes a snore fest after a couple of hours, at the start it's interesting enough to read all the documents and uncover clues to find out who framed you, but then it becomes a nightmare of finding objects and find where you are supposed to use them, some of them I have no idea how you where supposed to find out the solution without a walkthough.There is not nearly enough tips in the game as of how to use certain items, for example, how are you supposed to know Djinni is able to spy on people if you put its crystal in a nearby ""cup"" or ""bucket"" ? How are you supposed to know which object corresponds to which crystal in the corridor of elements to get the tome of elements?Horrid nightmarish time waster. Get the cards and get out.
