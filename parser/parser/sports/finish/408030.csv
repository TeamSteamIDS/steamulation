												This is by far my favorite game of all time. I found it in 2007 and it had already been around for 10 years when i had. The amount of game modes, and the stout teamwork/competition from its dedicated community is not duplicated from any other game. Pro: + Many maps that can support 2 players all the way to 99 players. Even 1v1v1v1 maps (or 2v2v2v2 or more!)+ Many modes including: Dodgeball, Racing, Hockey. Boxing, Tennis,  Corner Defence, Basketball and Eliminator which emulates the final round of american gladiators! + A chat lobby when you log into the game so you can actually talk to the community+ A way to see/observe any active game+ Many Leagues focuses on team and individual skill are going to be coming!+ Game is more than free to play, its free of pay, there arent even cosmetic items to buy+ Small file size / Easy to create an account (easy to share with friends and start up a game quick)Neurtral+/- Simple Graphics, for some people this will be bad, but i really am more focused on the gameplayIf you are interested in multiplayer games or sports this game is a must try. It is free and quick to download so there is no reason not to try it! I also have a youtube channel with some commentaries of some games check out my latest commentary!

												Uniball is one of the most rewarding and challenging games I’ve ever played. Players familiar with rocket league and haxball will immediately notice similarities in playstyle. With that being said, it is hard, it takes practice, and it has a solid learning curve. It also comes with a very experienced player community because the game is over 15 years old. New players can learn and practice a lot by playing with similarly skilled players and learn from those with much more experience. In Uniball's first launch on the steam platform, the developer has combined the two antiquated chat and game lobby clients, into a single seamless interface that can be launched from windows and mobile platforms (chat only).While the game does not currently offer an official ranked match making system upon release, it wouldn’t be too far of a stretch for one to be implemented in the future. In the past, player run leagues and ladders have been very successful in fueling competitiveness amongst the community. It will be interesting to see how those leagues translate over to the new steam version with newly integrated chat bot support. One of the major things Uniball has going for it, is that it does not maintain a low skill ceilings and dumb things down for the casual player. Players can easily draw strategic similarities from the likes of tradition mainstream sports such as soccer, basketball, hockey, and lacrosse. While the casual player can easily find fun and enjoyment in the game, players that wish to distinguish themselves from the pack can do so by exploiting the game’s complex but simple mechanics. Some players will pick things up quicker than others, but it can take a lifetime to master as the constantly evolving gameplay will continuously be shaped by those that play it.To summarize, below is a list of skills players can expect to manage and develop as a player.   Bouncing  Juking  Positioning (defensive, offensive)  Blocking  Boost conservation  Boost control  Graving (attracting the ball to your ship)  Strategy (traps, rotation, cuts, dives, blocks, lead passes, clears etc.)Uniball in my opinion is the closest thing you can get to as an actual, ‘esport’. Because of that, players can exhibit raw skill, but that skill can be constrained if they do not understand the strategy of the game. Similar to other sports players raw talent and understanding of how the sport is meant to be played goes hand-in-hand. I've played Uniball on and off since 2002 and it is my favorite game. Some games come and go, but this game always reels me back in time after time. It looks simple and has no flashy gfx, but the extremely competitive nature of the game play and community makes up for the rest. Thank you to the developer, NickW  (Stormbrewers), for all your hard work and continuing to develop a game that many of us grew up playing. May many more have the ability to do the same.

												One day in the year 2000 I stumbled across a simple looking game called Uniball and decided to give it a try.Years later, I finally started going to meetings to break the habit.Now Uniball has been revamped and made available on Steam; and I'm enjoying every minute of my relapse!Uniball is a game that can be enjoyed differently at all levels.You'll learn how to play within a minute, but it'll take thousands of hours to come even close to mastering this highly competitive e-sport!
