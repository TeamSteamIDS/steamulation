												Its a f2p Game or lets call it Pay2Win Browser/Facebook Game.Playing alone makes fun if you love the Riding Star Games. The good things is, controller works, and controlls are okay, at least much better then on the old Riding Star games.Bad think is, its still a p2w Facebook Game, because you need money to upgrade all your thinks, and you need action points to play. So after you played a few Stages you need to waite untile your action points fill up again.Playing this Game Online on Highscore or just to play Challanges makes is realy hard because you always need tickets. I dont know how to get this Tickets, i think the only way is to buy them or get it winning Online on ranked matches. For my first Challenges I wanted to join just for fun they asked me 150 Tickets, and I´m on Level 5, also I was not able to upgrade my Clothes because you need to much Diamonds. (Level 2 - 500-1000 Diamonds for 1 Item to get 10% more power/speed and more). Well I have sadly to give this game a negative review because its hard to get diamonds or upgrade your items without spending money. Yeah, the game is free but playing 3 or 4 rounds, jumping 20-40 seconds, not able to upgrade when you have a small level is like playing a demo, and demos are always free. Also there is a Premium Pack for 10$ witch brings you better items, more play time and stuff you need to play it. Thats the way p2w games works, buying Items to have better cards on winning the game. (it also effects the Highscore because without the Pro pack your Horse is lame and with the Pro Pack you get a faster horse what makes your time better)My Pros:Music is okayFor a Demo its good, you get a small taste You can get achivements with SteamIf you love horses and Horse Jumping its a nice but sadly short gameMy Cons:Pay 2 Win GameBrowser/Facebook GameNeeds Points/boost to play (they refill after a while) No upgrade without spending moneyNo Tutorial how to upgrade, skill your horse or play online Challenges.Multiplayer Game that cost Money to play Online and cost Points playing it singleI can only recommend this game to peoples they enjoy playing short Games or love Facebook games. Since its ""free"" you are free to test it by yourselfe. or buy the old Riding Star Games, they are cheap and not limited but with bad controlls.			",2141,1017,108,240,350,29,298

												Went in expecting a game about horses. Nope, its a facebook Payment Simulator.So little gameplay to even speak of, that most of this review will be about the pay2play nature of this game.GraphicsVery bad graphics.This looks like a launch title for the gamecube. Remember Maddens NFL 2002? Pretty much the same level of graphics.The people in the crowd low res images of 10-20 different people on them. Also so hurriedly put together they didnt do it right, and you have two rows of people in one plane, making for a very glitchy looking crowd.This is pretty much a port of a Facebook game, but you think they could at least have fixed that. Nope. The rest of the game is your low poly/low texture standard you would expect for a game on facebook. Its ported graphics get no merit here, especially on steam.GameplayYou can have your horse jump over obstacles and go around them. Theres different obstacle courses and if you pay you can play your friends or other people. Try and get on leaderboards.Dont forget every few courses you have to clean your horse down, which quickly turns into a chore. But you can pay to get past that..... thats it pretty much...In-App PurchasesIn order to play the game efficiently, you need to save your money to level up gear. But in order to keep playing you need to pay. See where this is heading? You have to wait a few hours after playing for 10-15 min and do this regularly all week. Youll end up playing like this for weeks, even months. Or you can pay up now and feel like your getting somewhere instantly.Your horse is tired and cant run courses. Your either gonna have to waste all your currency you were saving for leveling up gear or pay real money to buy an apple. (Even running in the training area tires your horse out)Getting tired of cleaning your horse every 5 minutes? Spend your currency to have it do instantly, or you could just buy more gold.You wanted to build an obstacle course? Each obstacle you place costs currency, or you pay real money.Want to challenge your friends. You need tickets, your gonna have to buy these.Want to do the tournaments? Play the same courses over and over again throughout the week, or your gonna have to pay up for tickets.Or you can pay for a premium membership to get rid of all these annoyances and stand a chance in the leaderboards.Cleaning your horse is a mechanic designed to feel like a chore, and if you have a premium membership you no longer need to do this. This itself is an indiciation of what you can expect from this game.Your going to have to pay hundreds to have this game give a semblance of achievement and fun.In summationThis game intentionally makes it not fun to play, unless you pay some real cash. It feels scummy and doesnt make for good game design. Facebook games really dont belong on steam and its a shame this pay2win and pay2play models are still around. I get that developers want some money from their product, but this is designed to milk people with certain tendencies. No different than slot machine to a person with gambling problem or booze to an alcoholic.Not recommended, and shameful to the medium.Review videoComing soon			",151,22,1,19,12,0,21

												I remember when this game was a buy to play title back in 2009 onwards. I also remember when they made the game free to play and that's pretty much when things started to go down I think. It was truly fun, I won't lie, but the lack of income led to the game's downfall. They switched to Facebook which in my opinion ruined the game. Now, we are here, on Steam and as many have mentioned the game is a classic pay to win facebook game which is a great shame.The game itself is okay. If you love horses, like show jumping or simply want to have a fun past time activity it's a good game, and it's free. You can own a horse that you can customize with a big number of different coats and patterns, main and tail colors, etc. You can buy new tack and new gear in the shop or upgrade what you already have to increase your stats. There's a ton of different courses where you can compete in ranked matches, alone, championships and so on. You have a paddock where you can run around and practice, collect small gifts of exp and coins/diamonds. When you level up you can assign points to different stats of your horse. At the end of the day you horse will need to be groomed and you can sit down and create your own courses for others to use. Well, that's pretty much it actually. And it's not as fun as it may seem. Or at least it's not as fun as it used to be. You no longer have dressage, or cross country (it was in the original game). The graphics seem far worse than the old game was (most likely because they put it on facebook). And to top it all off the game is a money sinkhole. You are required to buy a premium account (subscription) + buy diamonds which are necessary for you to upgrade your items to keep up with other people, and to buy items from the shop which will allow you to have a proper amount of action points which are needed to play and which run out ridiculously fast. Not to mention other small perks which cost diamonds. If you want to play this game casually I guess you can, but if you want to be at all competitive or spend more time playing this, you will have to cough up a lot of cash. The worst thing is that it's not worth it, cause the game doesn't seem to be getting any updates to it's gameplay or graphics. You'll get bored really fast. Despite the fact that I am marginally enjoying this game, I cannot really recommend it. At least not to serious players or those who are not extreme horse fans. You have to pay too much simply to play. Having action points (a.k.a. energy) to play is something that only facebook games should have, not proper computer games that you post here on Steam. If you are a hard core horse fan, give it a shot, because it's free. It's a nice little thing to pass the time. Your action points will not even last for anything longer. If not, then look for something else. If you are willing to pay for a sub, go play Star Stable.Update: I counted the amount of time you have to play with your avaiable action points when they are 100% full. It took me between 5 and 8 min to run out of them. Maybe less.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I quite like this game, it's a shame that is has to be free to play as your horse runs out of energy quite quickly. You either put your horse in the paddock for it to regenerate energy and go watch some movies or do something else or pay real money all the time to restore your horses energy.I wish this game could be buy to play, such as just buy the game for $10 and get to play the game as much as you want without energy restrictions.It's good that there is such a wide range of colours you can make your horse, only thing is there aren't different horse breeds so all the horses look the same shape and the only thing that differs is horse colour, I chose a grey horse with a white blaze, but in certain light, the horse looks very shiny and looks like metal, wanted to change her colour but of course it costs 5,000 coins.I tried to do a ranked event against someone for the first time, not a good result asevent matching is terrible, when doing a ranked match it put me against a lvl 35 horse and my horse is only lvl 5, so no way I could win. I guess because there aren't enough players, only 37 listed when I was playing. But then it did match me against a lvl 8, lost the first 2 times then won once. I would like to compete against others not the same person all the time. But I guess not many people play which is a shame. The game would be better if they made it buy to play as Iam not going to pay a monthly fee for an average game.The game is ok, if you love horses, want to test your skill and aren't sure what else to play. I hate the f2p mechanics. I reccomend as I still like playing it and like competing and find it mostly fun.			",74,18,0,13,12,1,2

												Much more stable than the facebook version. Glad to see it back! Used to play back in 2009 and this has always been one of my favorite horse games. Hopefully they will ad dressage and cross country as those were my two favorites.A must play if you like horse games! Good job to who ever is working on this again!			",25,8,0,9,9,0,2

												Ok, I downloaded this originally as a bit of a joke. I used to be super into riding games when I was younger. But then I thought I'd give my two cents.+ Cute horses+ Controls are good+ Animation is good- Terrible graphics- Poor choices of character customisation- The horse customisation should be better, instead of clicking through colours you should just be able to select.- 100% pay to win, bad game for younger people(which is what this is targeted towards afaik). It's a classic money grabbing game.- Not enough to do, even the grooming part feels like it's just there as a coin sink.- The only part of this game really is just the riding parts, there's no story or anything to get you engaged, so take it as it is, a sportsgame and nothing else.The game is free, but if you're considering this for your kids, be aware they might want you to buy them coins.

												This is a pretty good game. However, I'm a little bit bored now with this game, after only two hours of playing.CONS: Despite being free, it's a hard game. Hard to earn money, hard to get enough XP to level up, and hard to get up in the rankings.PROS:There are HORSES!!! You can compete against other players... which is really really fun! You can also buy a second horse! YAY!Well, overall, I think It's a pretty nice game! 8/10.			",3,3,0,1,0,0,0

												I played this game a while back when it was first available for download before it moved to Facebook (which I played, too, but quickly abandoned due to its p2w leanings) and now Steam. I loved the original version of the game; back then it was fun and challenging and although many of those components did transfer over from its earlier predecessor it seems like it retained more of its Facebook flaws than it did the greatness of its first version. With recent updates the company producing this game is shooting for quick cash by pricing in-game upgrades WAY above the rate at which in-game currency is collected. Not only that but levelling has turned into a nightmare -- I can completely understand making those higher levels a little more challenging, but only gaining 100xp every time you complete a course when needing 21,000+ in order to level up is maddening and not so easy for people who don't have that sort of time to spend on a game that, honestly, offers so little at this point. Asidde from those aspects I do enjoy this game - I have since I orignally discovered it so many years ago. I would suggest to the developers, though, that they make gaining XP and currency easier, take away the ""pay for currency"" gimmicks, and instead focus on making money through a meaningful subscription - such as attractive ""add ons"" for those who do decide to invest in the game in order to help it grow. Maybe, rather than reaching for funds by limiting a players ability to earn currency in-game, they should focus on ""premium"" aspects that someone would be interested in paying for (possibly like the ability to own multiple horses, etc.) -- I know this game is a bit of a fledgling (again) but there are better ideas out there to help get it off the ground other than pure frustration for the people who are playing it at this point.

												One of the worst examples of ""freemium gaming"" geared directly at children i've ever seen.Please do not allow your kids to play this on an account with a credit card saved to it. They will spend alot of money.As for adults who want to play for some reason - 90+fps on a gtx 1070 highest settings.horse controls like a tank in an early 2000's shooter.Visuals are exspected for a game geared towards children.levels work similar to the golf club. a random allotment of official and player made. Generally speaking, aside from some easy achievements in the first 5-10 minutes there's nothing compelling or entertaining. Even in a ""it's so bad it's good"" sense sadly.Truly another game inhibiting the toxic stew of microtransaction diaharrea found in the steam free to play section. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is genuinely fun for me - I have an equestrian background and I find it very relaxing to play, and fairly realistic to the mechanics of both horse movement, and of course building and jumps in real life. However, it's a free to play game that's heavily gated by premium purchases - to the point where you get less than 10 minutes of free play for an hour of sitting around waiting for your action points to regenerate. At $10 a month you can increase this a lot - but it's still not unlimited. If this game was $10-20 to buy and unlock, with perhaps a few premium purchases for the ranked matches and tournaments (with prizes to make it worth it), then I would pay for it. But $10 a month + diamonds to upgrade gear + tickets to enter tournaments = money money money.Pros:* Realistic and responsive gameplay* Loads of solo play courses, including user created courses, some of which are really very detailed (like the replicas of the olympic courses!)* Create your own courses with extensive options* Ranked games and tournaments* Lots of upgradeable equipment and stats - good progressionCons:* Severely gated by time without spending real money.* Gated upgrades without spending money.* Gated tournament entries without spending money.* Basically extremely hard to play without spending considerable sums ($10 a month + lots of extras).Relaxing game with a ton of content for those who enjoy equestrianism, but sadly made unplayable unless you're going to spend oodles of cash. Such a pity. ",524,161,8,104,76,6,105

												Very good idea but, action points and pay to win logic has ruined this game.

The biggest con of this game is action points. They could've made more balanced winning prizes and upgrade costs too.			",62,7,3,6,18,1,8

												I played this game years ago, before it went to facebook due to funding issues. Back then it had Cross country, Dressage, Agility/Obstacle and Show Jumping. It wasn't free to play. When it went to face book they dumbed it down considerably, to the point that I wouldn't touch it. Now that the history lesson is out of the way...The revision seems solid. It's still missing Dressage (Thank god, that was so boring) and Cross country (Very sad) but it has the Show jumping and obstacle courses. As well as almost all the old horse colorations, even if you can't mix and match your own anymore they still gave us most of the combinations. (I got my old horse back, for instance)The game does take a little skill to master. Horses do lead changes (correctly, might I add) and they jump fluidly. You have to master your aim and allow your horse to line up it's strides for the jump. If you keep adjusting you will lead change and hit it. The game also allows for you to do hard turns, which is as rare in a horse game as correct lead changes or stride-length. You can lengthen or shorten your own stride as well, which is important depending on how close together the jumps are or how wide they are. I'm not used to the skill point and leveling system but I guess it adds incentive, especially if they don't intend to keep the game afloat with vanity items alone. Since they revised the system in october I am finding myself more tempted to play longer and possibly purchase a sub. A player can level up thier items the same way they level thier horse and each peice of clothing or tack has it's own stats so you can mix and match what you think you need. It is possible to get through the game without paying a dime, but it will take some dedication and time. It's good to remember though that support breeds development. Speaking of horses and breeding. There is none of that in this game. You get one horse and only one. I do not know at the time of this review if you can change it with an item so choose your steed with care. And remember to groom it often, (arrowkeys make grooming and hoof cleaning easier) as it will get quite dirty. :PI adore this game and always have, I am very nitpicky about my horse games as well and while simple, RCC is a quality game for what it is attempting to achive. Especially for being almost 10 years old and dug up from the digital grave twice now.			",66,28,2,7,8,0,11

												Fantastic horse game where you can actuallly compete live against other players.There are so many different courses covering show jumping and tricky twisty agility courses which are well thought out and well laid out. Varying degrees of difficulty for new players to pro's. And the horses actually do lead changesMultiple colors for your horses, probably the widest range I have ever seen on a horse gameI adore this game, I've played when it was a stand alone, then since day 1 from the Facebook release and will now play here too.Yes, it has microtransactions, but unless you really cannot wait to advance, you can quite easily play for free, I reached max level without payig a cent. There is a weekly competition that's great fun and you have to earn a place in the final on Sundays, pretty good prizes too.The action points run out a bit fast, but there are upgrades that you can use to extend them and make them fill faster.  There are things to do that don't need them, Course editor where you cn make and publish your own courses, or just save them to practise on, challenge your friends with the free social tickets you get each day when you log in or just chat while they refill.Overall gets 11/10 from me			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Update: 22/10/2016The developers listened to our concerns and the EXP to level was changed back to normal so now it is no longer a grind to level up and make your horse better. Thank you for the devs listening to their players :D Some of my old points still stand from before so read below for parts I do not enjoy about it.TL:DR: I would only recommend this game to those that like Facebook games or short-horse games, otherwise I would not recommend it as there is not much to the game gameplay-wise.----------------------------------------------------------------+ Free+ Achievements+ Multiplayer (kinda)- 3 modes- Not much keeping the game alive- Is a Facebook gameFirstly, log in rewards are lame and not really ""rewards"", 10 coins is a reward for logging in 16 days in a row, what  a joke since you can get that after 1 single race alone. It does not seem like a ""reward"" to me for logging in everyday.Pretty much there are 3 modes, you either play a course on your own, play against someone else to try and beat their time or just play around in a mode where you get presents/stars for little bonuses that rarely drop without a shop item. Either way 2 of the modes feel the same because you are still on your own. You never see the other player race.Before the change, leveling your gear was a grind-fest and not very fun to do.Only good thing about the change is that it is much easier to level up your gear now and to buy other gear. However some of the consumables cost too much compared to how much you earn per race/ranked match (looking at you skill book!)Oh and the energy bar was changed from 100 and 200 which was a nice change so thank you for that!--------------------------------------------Yeah, the game is boring, the only thing I believe is keeping it fun and alive is the ranked matches where you compete against actual players times. This is the only thing I log on for.Otherwise there is not much else to do but chat which does not last long or take 2 minutes to groom your horse after you have raced for abit.I would skip this game to my friends, it has no actual fun gameplay to it but repeating courses after courses on ranked before your energy bar is empty. No actual multiplayer or fun to it compared to other free games out there and there are better horse games than this out there.If you like achievements though (like me) download it and give it a shot.I play this game for about 5 minutes everyday and that is it really. Because it is a Facebook game you can already tell there will not be much to it and has to be played in VERY short bursts to be enjoyed. It really is lacking but what can you really do for a Horse-Riding game?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												this gorgeous game, in my opinion is much more enjoyable than the other riding games here that you have to PAY for. (riding out, my life with horses etc) its a fun addictive game suitable for all ages and teaches you about horses and how to care for one. many coat colours but the only thing wrong with it, is that you can only have one horse. :T ",5,2,0,4,5,0,0

												I really enjoy the Facebook game from time to time, and to see it on Steam made me happy cause I thought there would be something new added...However, nothing new is added and you have no option to add your progress from Facebook into your account. Basically this is just a game from Facebook made downloadable. Unless new features are coming, I would say it isn't really worth the time it takes to download or the space it takes up on your computer - you can just play it on Facebook.TLDR: It is just a Facebook game made available for download. It has a nice potential though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's timekilling and has it's pros (ranking system, friend challenges, showdowns) and cons (lagging, p2w, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ points system). I enjoy playing it. I recommend it to people who like to ride real horses.			",161,18,11,18,15,2,32

												(FIRST REVIEW) I didn't really like it that much, for only one reason: it's too laggy and unplayable. It seems the creators of this game were focused more on graphics and less on quality. To fix this, possibly add an opening screen with a ""Change graphics quality"" or ""Remove shadows"" button so the game will run faster, instead of pushing the player right into gameplay with no direct option of changing the graphics quality or anything like that. Without the intense lag, I think this would be an awesome game! Just attempt to make the game smoother and it should be just fine. Until then, I'll give this a 3/10 for the amazing graphics I saw.(EDIT AFTER REPLY) The lag was fixed now! This is an awesome game, so I'd give it a 9/10. I recommend this if you love horses, showjumping, or agility (for horses). Thank you to Artplant Games!			",2,1,1,0,2,0,0

												Good stuff:You can customize your horse and rider with lots of differently colored items (lots of colors, not lots of items).You can race against other people on horses.It makes a nice plinking noise when you successfully jump over an obstacle.If you are tired and bored of more interesting games, you might enjoy wasting a few minutes playing this.You can get rid of your extra money to spend a few more minutes playing.Grooming your horse is sort of interesting the first few times.  It closes really fast.It doesn't have overly intrusive ads (as in ads that interrupt you while you are riding).It is free to install, run and play, if you are willing to wait to regain energy.I haven't seen any spelling errors.I haven't experienced any crashes.It encourages the use of math by enticing one to calculate how long it takes refill the energy bar.It encourages you to go ride a real horse rather than sit and wait for an hour to ride a fake horse for five minutes.I could go on, there is just so much great stuff about this game!Bad stuff (the main two for me):First, the energy/aciton point depletion rate.  You have an initial maximum of 100 points, which are consumed at a rate of 4 points per jump and 1 point every few seconds of running or standing within the paddock (even while paused).  These points are restored while resting (on the main menu) at a rate of 1 point every 35 seconds, which works out to 100 points in an hour.  This means you can play for about 5-10 minutes every hour.In fairness, you can upgrade certain clothing items to offset this, increasing the rate of recharge to 1 point every 17ish seconds and a max of 200 points.  But the amount of currency to upgrade the items needed is ridculous.Second, the currency rewards are pitiful.  There are two kinds of courses, jumping and agility.  Either way, if you knock stuff over, you incure penalties.  Once you complete the course, you receive 100 coins, 5 diamonds and 100 xp (after gaining 9 levels, these rates have remained unchanged).These rewards are unaffected by how well you ran the course, which means you could knock everything over and still get the maximum reward.To put these numbers in perspective, an apple that restores 100 energy costs 400 diamonds.The most basic of the upgrades mentioned above costs 5000 coins and 500 diamonds.To get this much currency, you would have to run 50 courses.In the end, to play this game, you will either be paying lots of money or spending a lot of time waiting to recharge your horse so you can grind your way through a few minutes of play.

I can't even stop playing it, honestly.I have played it since I downloaded it, very fun from what I can tell.I haven't encountered a bug/glitch yet, bugs/glitches are most likely are rare to encounter.Lots of horse coats to choose from, different colored manes, nameable horse, also you can choose the gender of your horse, which I find really cool!Over a dozen of jackets, helmets, saddles, saddle pads, etc. to choose from.You can groom your horse, train it and even increase it's skills when you level up!

												Nothing but a shadow of what it used to be.i played this game loooong before it became a facebook thing, it was smooth, beautiful and hrs!!! of fun. now, it's bad looking horses, looks nothing like they used to, ugly low quality coats, mane and tail just a stiff piece of blank plastic - yeah the tail moves, but nothing like it used to. the mechanics are off, the horses runs regardless of you pressing the button up n down, you need to change gait with 1,2,3 .. the jumps are slow, the horses are slow - i get that you'll have to train it and add stats to it.. but it takes forever.. i took a course where you needed tight fast turns.. impossible to achieve.the different gaits have no tail anims and it feels like it takes forever to move somewhere. when i saw the game being on steam i was like YES!!!! i hated the facebook version, and now i was sure i had the chance to finally play it like in the good old days. - but no!im uninstalling, and im very dissappointed, it is nothing!!! like the original RCC. will not recommend at this date. there's other horse games out there for free which are WAY better.

												This is one of the best games out there. You start by doing a race and then you start making your character and your horse. The character creation is better than in for example Skyrim. You get like three options when you make your character, but it's still the best you can find. Once the character is done you can start racing right away! Awesome right? That is not the best part. The best part is that you can groom your horse just like in real life! How cool is that?! You can buy new clothes and gear in the shop. You can even buy food for your horse!

												You see those screenshots? that video with the majestic horses taking those jumps like its peanuts? Looks promising doesn't it?Yeah well, that won't be you. Not now and possibly not ever. Unless you are willing to pour your wallet in this game of course.I used to play this game when it was still a stand alone, the game was great, cept for maybe wait times for ranked matches. but other than that it was almost flawless.But then it shut down, went to facebook and to♥♥♥♥♥♥Adopted the dumb point recovery system which gives you with a bit of luck about 10mins of play time a day.If that wasn't bad enough, they decided to bring this game to steam, going from a facebook widget to a somewhat stand alone has ♥♥♥♥ed this game up even more.according to the game I am running it with a solid 60 - 109 fps.Now I'm getting the experience of 15fps at best. It lags, glitches out, the opitmization is, well nowhere to be found.You have a slow connection you say? don't even bother then. even with a fast connection you're still rubberbanding.there is absolutely nothing ""fun"" or ""good"" left about this game.RIP you used to be great.

												Riding Club Championships is a ""free to play"" Facebook browser game that is only Pay to Play and very expensive to play as that.  It worked on Win 10, looked bad, sounded bad, played bad.   Has steam achievements.  The only thing that you can do without spending money is ride a basic horse around the training paddock.  Didn't have much of a tutorial but does have a help website.  Only people that like horse riding sports might like this game.  It has a daily login reward system. Graphics were not very good.  The sounds of the horse running was terrible. The game lags badly and naggs you to reduce your graphic quality to decrease lag.  The animations are not fluid or missing for some things ( obstacles knocked over). This game has a stamina system so once you run out of time, you have to wait a few hours, just to play only 20 minutes.  Your Horse tires quickly and only Apples that you buy with real money works to replenish your horse.  To challenge a friend, you have to buy a ticket with real money.  It is only recommend for Windows Vista and Win 7 OSs and been optimized to run from Facebook only.   I had more fun riding a horse on LOTRO, than i did here.Try it, but delete it before you spend real money on this game and look for a better horse riding game than this one.For more info:

												I played this game before on facebook, the graphics are ok but they don't run pretty well on not-so-good computer like mine so FPS is really low even the worst graphics so that makes me really not life it... Leveling up is kinda slow and energy bar is kinda annoying, but hopefully get to play this more when I level up :).			",10,9,0,0,6,0,1

BIG PLUS! ITS 100% CO-OP! al say that as co-operative! its 100% co-operative indeed! just its a GG.			",18,2,1,1,4,0,0

												YOU LOVE HORSES... I'm pretty sure you do, and that's why you are looking for these kind of games. But here's the big problem: this game is BORING in a GREAT way. Once you start, you have to practice how to jump with your horse, NOT a big deal. Then, you are just too eager to explore the world around, but NO, you can only JUMP and JUMP... The End. If you are looking for adventure, and to experience the feeling of having a horse like 'in real', maybe you would have more fun with ""Star Stable"" (game you find on Google Chrome) rather than this... :')			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I think this is a great game with great performace, it requires skill and precision. I am already a pro rider in this game because i am paying $8/m. I think it is worth it since you get a bigger advantage then the rookies. even though i have .6 hours I am good because i ride horses irl and this is like a simulation to me so its easy. I am currently rank 100 in the world aiming for 50. As always This aint my first rodeo, Cowboy out!			",35,2,0,1,2,0,1

												Riding Club Championships is a good game. You can ride a horse while being a minority, which really helps my self-confidence as a minority. Without representation I would not have lived this long, honestly. Anyways, the game. Riding Club Championships is best played as a black woman. It allows you to discuss with other women, who probably play this on facebook. They are very polite. I was not insulted for my beliefs. But anyways, the game. One of the maps is probably impossible, as I never beat it. While this is a flaw, I am sure they will fix it eventually. I am not PRIVVY to other flaws, honestly, because of my 970. tbh, this is a good game with a good story. It builds on the predecessor's story while also holding up on its own. I did, however, feel a bit cheated when my rival was faster than me while lower level. Over all, I give this an 8/10.			",45,11,0,10,6,1,6

												Don't play this game.  There is an elitist club of bitter old hags who ban anyone who disagrees with them.  They don't like Vin Diesel or the Rock and if you like them they say you aren't nice and ban you.  I was on a streak and they didn't like that so I got banned for 12 hours.  12 HOURS!  Can you believe that?!?! I think I won't play again, at least for 12 hours.  IS THIS REAL!??!  I put lots of time and effort into grooming a nice horse and this is how they repay me?  NO!  NOT TODAY!  IT'S MY HORSE BIRTHDAY!  I won't stand for this, I will probably get a refund.			",222,43,2,16,8,1,23

I was hoping to frollock in the padock with my friend and his horse NIgel, I'm sad that wasn't a feature. Please, Riding Club Championship gods, add that as a feature. I want to see my friends black and ginger horse!---------------------------------------It's been 7 days, still no sign of paddock frollocking,I've gone into a deep depression.Please help me, Nigel is starting to get rejected and I can't help him because I can't visit other people.All mighty gods, let me save Nigel from this horrible neglect....10/10 ign			",60,7,0,3,10,0,2

												I'm not quite sure what to think of this yet. I only played it for a short time and didn't really delve to deep into it. Seemed simple enough but, I feel like I eon't be spending real money on it any time soon.  I would recommend it if you want some building aspect of making courses and just enjoy the riding of the horses. Bt, it's not too action packed.

												As a horse-person myself, I like horse games. I don't really know why I like them, because I'm way ""too old"" to play horse games. But this game. It's really bad. It's a free facebook game from the beginning. It's one of those games that you need energy to play. It's annoying, the sound is bad. I can't really complain about the graphics, even if I want to, because all horse games usually have this graphics. And sure, it may be funny if you're a high level, BUT YOU CAN'T GET ON A HIGH LEVEL IF YOU SPEND ALL YOUR ENERGY.			",30,0,1,2,8,0,0

I got this random female, and a generic horse. I don't know if it was the style I chose but I didn't see a BUY button and when I said I was done it didn't say error, but nonetheless I have to pay to change it just because I didnt get my orange and black horse for halloween. I have to say to have to PAY to change your GENDER, not even your horse's gender, I want to look how I want to look and shouldn't be forced to be some random selection of items.			",32,3,0,3,4,0,2

												I stumbled upon this game while attempting to find horse vore porn and was initially very upset and flacid, but when I started actually playing, I realised this was the best game I have ever encountered.Let's start with the gameplay. You get to ride around as a horse with the spacebar and arrow key, and let me tell you when I say it takes skill to beat all the middle-aged women playing this game via facebook. Sometimes I almost have to concentrate on the game instead of staring intently at the horse and wondering if my fantasies will ever come true.But more importantly, the in-depth story. You are a new rider who's trying to make it in the horse-riding scene. The plot only gets deeper when you realise that if you fail to become to number one rider in the world, you too will become a single middle-aged woman who plays this game in her spare time when not looking for dates on match.com so she can actually have children before her biological clock runs out. It really adds pressure to the game.Overall, this game has wit and charm, and I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to feel alive anymore, and is waiting for the slow embrace of death to take them away.9/10			",55,28,2,10,17,1,9

												Riding Club Championships seems pretty well made all things considered. I went in expecting to have a bad time but I was surprised that the game is more than decent, and I am sure that if you are a fan of horseback riding as a sport you should check out Riding Club Championships.

												Don't download this. Not even as a jokeI didn't think steam was allowed to promote suicide but choosing between playing that game or ending it allI know which I'd pickUPDATE: Jokes aside, A developer asked me to provide a more detailed reason why I did not reccomend this game. You can read that in the comments of this review.			",81,7,6,6,8,1,5

												Interesting game. Rather impressed it's Free to Play and not a lot of money. The animations of the horse are a bit cheesy. I like it, though. It's really fun, rather friendly community. One downside is that you have to pay a lot of diamonds and gold for a lot of things. Even just to change you or your horse's appearance. Matches against other players can be a challenge simply because of speed. Another downside is waiting for your horse to gain more Action Points, which takes AGES unless you have enough diamonds/gold to buy treats. Jumping can be tricky, but you get used to it aftewr crashing through about 60 of them. Thumbs up for me!			",37,10,0,4,8,0,0

												I MISS THE OLD RIDING CLUB CHAMPIONSHIP (~2008)BRING THE CROSS AND DRESSAGE BACK AND I GUARANTEE OLD PLAYERS WILL NOTICE YOU.I only spent money on this game because they deserved it and I owed them something for filling up my childhood fantasies(from when I was around 11 years old, now im almost 19). If I was a person who never heard of this game I wouldn't put my time or money on it right now because it is literally pay to win... This game's company goes from extreme left to extreme right. First the game was almost 100% free and BAAAAM..! Shut down. ;_; (sad days)Now the game is almost 100% pay to win... I smell the same thing incoming. ;_;			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is by far the best horse sim I have ever played. I have played many other horse sims, but nothing stacks up to this. The horse physics are amazing, and the player models are truely next gen. I have searched a long time for something as great as this. I did a controlled study of people playing this game and everyone in the focus group rated 12/10. It made my girlfriend pregnent.			",52,19,0,0,12,0,3

												This game is a mix of battlefield one and CS:GO Comp. It's super competitive and it will leave you afraid all of the time, always on the edge of your seat. The game is flawless, and the story will take you through an emotional rollar coaster. The story telling is ALMOST as good as the metal gear franchise. Also you can groom your horse and treat it with respect, growing an emotional bond with it, until act 2 when you put him down. Otherwise f2p game is gud game.Jk don't play this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥			",181,21,7,15,8,1,11

												A complete masterpiece, this game will be remembered as the gold standard for years to come. The story is exciting every second, and will have you at the edge of your seat.

												Absolute Masterpiece. Sets the gold standard for every other game to come. Definitely the best Game of 2016. Many fantastic items and so many options. I really like the feature that the horse keeps turning for another second after you tell it to stop as that is realistic. I also likke the many different options for horse colors you can choose from. This is a massive step up from games like No Guy Buy and Twatcraft, the creation aspect is there and it just has much better execution than the other two.			",13,1,0,2,7,0,3
