												Full disclosure: I bought this game at 96% off, for fifteen pence. And even at that price, I would not recommend buying this game.This game in a word? Unrealised. The actual game has two themes -- the first being a fairly generic 'your actions have moral consequences' theme that's used extremely simplistically by giving an occasional yes/no choice, and the second being age, which is dealt with only in an exceedingly shallow capacity. While both of these themes can be compelling when written sufficiently well, the more unique and interesting one is age; most people playing videogames are fairly young or approaching middle age, so age is a topic that gets swept under the rug or only dealt with as a way to get rid of a character in most games. Given a nuanced portrayal, it could have been excellent here. It wasn't.In terms of gameplay, it has the standard non-combat rpg maker formula -- wander around, talk to people, get information, solve puzzles. Most rpg maker games will attempt to flavour their world beyond the basic graphics by giving interesting flavour text on clickable items, a feature I adore. True, this game does have many clickable items, and a lot of flavour text... but all of it is either very bland descriptions of what you're looking at, or immature flavour text.Actually, let's cycle back to the immature bit. Do you think naked pixelated old men are funny? Do you think it's great that a good portion of your game world is compared to poo? Because that's why some of the steam pages related to this game ask for age confirmation, and the devs never seem to get tired of it. It's pretty much worthless in terms of content, both comedically and in terms of worldbuilding. It just makes the game seem like it was made by juvenile teenagers.The writing, outside of the themes it tries and fails to tackle, is uninspiring. NPCs are both unlikeable and boring, as, in fact, are all the player characters. There simply isn't enough dialogue given -- in a format, mind you, that really *needs* dialogue and description in order to be effective -- to characterise even one of the protagonists beyond a very simple pastiche of whatever their problem is. I feel like the dev(s?) of this game aren't really familiar with creating works of art or fiction -- although, as a plus, I only noticed one glaring grammar problem (an NPC using ""were"" when the correct version for the context would have been ""where."" There were moments of writing which, although not fantastic, was at least interesting (the nurse chapter, with the mindscrew hospital segment  was intriguing).Poor programming is also evident; two instances that I spotted were being able to drive directly into the wall of the Pub while in my car, and the game locking up if you gave a certain item to an NPC from below. Usually, giving the item triggers the npc to down one square out of your way, and there is no exception made for the player choosing to stand there. Even accepting that there may be technical limitations in coding npc behaviour, it would have been child's play to simply make the npc move back through the passage to a square the player couldn't occupy, or alter the map slightly to ensure the player couldn't stand below the npc but the npc could still move there.On top of that, there is a huge lack of content in this game. It can all be seen and discovered in an hour or two, with no real problem; after that, everything else is repetition and padding. Ultimately, it feels like somebody's first game in rpg maker -- ambitious themes, poor execution. And that's perfectly fine, but not if there's an asking price. If you want a combat-light rpg maker game with better writing, more entertaining characters, and don't mind nudity (which, to be fair, this game has as well), then go and download Embric of Wulfhammer's Castle. It's free, and a shining example of what rpg maker games can do when the effort's put in considering all the detail and jokes put into the world. If you're considering buying this as a way to support the developer/support other rpgmaker games being on steam, don't. This game also had a small kickstarter (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1604197967/greyfox); again, considering you'll find much, much better rpgmaker games out there for free, has already created more money than the product deserves.To improve this game, I would advise the devs to recruit somebody with some real writing experience to draw out the potential of the themes it tries to handle, and, moreover, consider whether this is really the medium the game needs in order to shine. Very little of the good points of this game would be lost if it were in a visual novel format, due to the flavour text in the environment being mostly not worthwhile, and it would give the game chance to focus on dialogues, characterisation and story while dropping the largely redundant fetch quest gameplay. I would also advise them to do a little market research and observe what the standards are for commercial games of this type. To clarify: I think there's potential here in the themes, and if I had just downloaded it as somebody's first rpg maker project, I would be considerably more enthusiastic about it. But Greyfox is not a good enough product to demand money for, and too basic to justify the kickstarter that was attached. With more experience, this game could have been a gem. As it is? Not worth it.			",145,63,3,45,12,0,5

“I am incapable of conceiving infinity, and yet I do not accept finity. I want this adventure that is the context of my life to go on without end.”  ― Simone de Beauvoir, La VieillesseGreyfox is a really short RPGMaker adventure game that tries to come as an empathy simulation with the touch of speculative supernatural motifs scattered on the side. Fair warning though: pledging catch phrases like ""a town with a sinister secret"" and ""uncover its mysteries"" that we encounter in the trailer are quite the misleading advertisement here. Whether there be any sinister secret or a mystery to uncover - or not, it sadly won't be in our heroine's power to reveal in this really, really short adventure. We are just invited for a brief experience and shooed away to carry on with our lives without much explanation.If we are to arrange a consistent outline of events; here we have a young, dumbly cheery heroine who gets bored of her daily rush in the big city and decides to move into the retirement community of Greyfox. She comes in, greeted by a townful of dull, bitter old people without an ounce of empathy left in them and struggles through some frustrating interactions. Tired by the end of her first day, the heroine is welcomed by a mysterious old lady in the local pub only, with a sarcastic yet intriguing proposition to make: What if you could live their lives and decide their fates? By the touch of this mysterious lady, our heroine is to live an ordinary day in the lives of four town inhabitants and decide their fates eventually.Let's blurt out the truth: as far as choice and consequence games go, Greyfox isn't one of the greatest, but that doesn't mean that its trash. The game feels mysterious and deep at first, but it unravels to become quite superficial in display, limited and fractured in dialogues; and sadly rushed in its endings. On the other hand, there is also some symbolic figures and attributions to other games in the genre here and there, that may bring a brief smile when encountered. There is quite a good amount of anecdotes scattered around the little town for you to discover, alongside some interesting characters.One primarily weak point of all display is the narrative. It is depressing, cyclical and limited in its perspective. There isn't much humor - or at least qualitative humor to lessen the burden of the subject, yet the gravity isn't concluded with a consistent argument either. The final conclusion presented by the mysterious lady about the concept of right and wrong felt a bit contradictory for my taste. Please do not go into this little adventure to come across a genuine miracle. You'll get what you pay for: a small story with one ambiguous point of view that will present you maybe something to think about. With better writing, this game could have been much, much more.Graphics are basic RPGMaker, without a notable soundtrack or any voice acting. Character designs are somewhat curious and interesting though. The first playthrough will take about an hour - one and a half at max - and the game has 3 different endings. Going for all will give you roughly 2 hours of gameplay. Oh, and it has achievements if that means anything to you. For its current price, I think its basically fair deal. If on sale; heck, why the hell not to support an indie developer struggling to create her first game?Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												Greyfox is a short and sweet little game made in RPG Maker, thugh I'd not call it an RPG since it really is more of a point and click adventure type of game.  The premise is really interestng as it is modern day.You play as a young girl looking to better her life.  She quits her job and moves to a town called Greyfox with no promise of a new job or even a place to live.  Then you meet a strange woman who tries to deter her from staying and she leads the main character through a set of dreams where she gets to live the lives of other people in the town.Good points:+Interesting premise+The four characters your main character gets to walk around as are interesting.+Lot of stuff to discover and people to talk to, obvious care was taken at constructing this little town.+Multiple endingsNeutral points:*Rather short, I was able to get all the achievements in less than two hoursNot so good points:-The main character really was lacking in any characterization-The characters whose lives you lived were in some cases very stereotypical elderly people even if they were interesting.Overall though, I'd recommend the game.  It's short and simple, but also not very pricey.  It's definitely a game to pick up and play and you can easily finish in one game session.  The premise is definitely unique and a refreshing change.			",245,462,0,130,43,2,51

												This game is bad. It's boring, cliched, and unpolished. It didn't connect with me enough to be depressing, and the promised mystery doesn't materialize. The plot starts with a deus ex machina, and ends with a moral unrelated to any of the preceding events.This game could have been interesting. It tries to deal with themes you rarely see in video games. But the potential is completely unrealized. I regret the pennies I spent on this game, but more than that I regret the time I wasted on it.I know it might be tempting to pick this up if you're an achievement hound, for the easy 100%. But don't do it. Have some self-respect.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

An ok short rpg worth some penniesPros:+ Cheap+ Worth the money+ Easy game to beat+ Has achievements and trading cardsNeutral Points:> Story is ok but lacking in crucial parts, such as the ending, which seemed rushedCons:- Short- No combat- Lacks depth overall- Dialogue is quite bad- Choices don't matter regardless of being made out they doDownload Size: 347mbTrading cards: 5 cards in the setAchievement difficulty: Easy to 100%Hours to 100%: 2-3Rating: 3/10Recommendation: If you have the spare change to waste it's okMy Opinion:Overall it is cheap and worth the small amount of money I spent on it because I got some trading cards and a easy 100% game. Other than that I didn't enjoy the game much due to the reasons above. If you are looking for a great RPG maker game then I'd keep looking, there are certainly better, but if you are looking for a easy to 100% game then this would be good for you.

												An RPG maker game that is set in the modern day.For once you're not an Elf warrior fighting dragons and wizards, but you're a normal human being in a normal world.Well, mostly normal.Greyfox is a short game, but the game does have you make multiple decisions which will lead to different endings so there is some replayability. It also has Steam achievements.It's definitely worth a play through or two.			",2533,1063,103,328,347,26,430

												At most, I think the game is okay.I can see what its goal was to do and for what it presents, it's okay as a whole. However, the dialogue can be groan-worthy at times and the story arc for each character is too short to actually be memorable or even to have anything more than the cliches. I was able to finish this game and got all the achievements in less than two hours. The game tries to present this ""depressing"" and ""mysterious"" story and present ""tough"" choices for the fate of each character, but looking at it as a whole, it doesn't exactly deliver the impact that it wants to give off.// Spoilers start here, I guess //""A town with a sinister secret"", ""Uncover its mysteries"".These are two phrases that appear in the trailer, but really, I personally felt misled. There's no secret or mystery about the town; You move to a little town from the city and you feel ready to retire when some woman with the power to implant you into other peoples' bodies wants you to see that you're still too young and you aren't really ready for death. She shows you the stories of those who are, and you have the choice of whether or not you think each character should die. There's no ""discovering the truth"" unless you're just learning about the characters' backgrounds, and even then, they're pretty flat and to the point.For a game that literally has the aspect of ""tough choices"" in its description, even the character you play as doesn't have a lot of feeling in either choice you made. She replies with short sentences that hardly show emotion, so why should the player have any emotion? Furthermore, when you can just skip to the end for some parts of an arc, it really puts all the other dialogue and event checks to waste, like in Kat's where all you have to do is get your medicine and talk to the Mysterious Woman.One thing that bugs me is that once you finish going through the characters' stories, she tells you how many people you chose to kill and tells you that she hopes you're ready to take on the guilt of your actions for the rest of your life, but she also tells you that she's not going to tell you what's ""right"" or ""wrong,"" which feels extremely contridictory to me. She brings you into these peoples' lives for you to judge them, and of course it's by your norm moral standards, so naturally you and the woman must have a sense of ""right"" and ""wrong"" when she talks about guilt for your murders (if you chose to do that), so what's her real angle here? That aspect of the story is just a nitpick for me, though.// Spoilers end here //Maybe I'm just more heartless than most people, but I don't really feel the impact of a depressing story like all the other positive reviewers do, because I don't feel for these characters. I do understand what the developer may have been trying to go for and it was a nice attempt. It could have been worse.As for the visual aspect, it's not anything terrible. They're decent; Using RPG Maker's base elements plus others' isn't something that should account into this game./// TL;DR: I think that Greyfox is alright for a start, but is definitely only worth the $0.19 paid for it. I hope the developer will continue to try and make more content that will have a more fleshed-out story.			",108,49,1,18,18,1,9

												I'm going to be honest here that I have been doubting about the final verdict of this game but overall all points generally point into the negative direction. The game has been made with RPG-maker and that is a part that I recognised. However the effort put into the game itself aside from the RPG-maker aspects are unclear to me since I'm not familiar with the program. Greyfox is a game about a girl, around between mid-twenties and thirties, who is sick with her job and wants to move to a town called Greyfox and live there. When she encounters someone peculiar in the bar she gets to play God and decide about the inhabitants of Greyfox who shall live another day and who must die. I think the town itself is pretty well structured but there is not a lot to do aside from the few 'side missions' you can do before the main story unveils. You can interact with almost every object in the game with some jokes here and there but most of them are cheesy jokes. Each part of the story opens up a different part of town which I wouldn't have minded if it had a particular reason.The main problem was to me that the story tried to pull me in and trying to let me empathise with the characters but it didn't happen even slightly. Everyone in that town is just either grumpy or close to silent there is no in between. I think the concept for the story was a good idea but the execution was off. If you enjoy an RPG that solely relies on his story and don't care about combat in an RPG you should consider this. Even if you like story driven games you should think twice before you buy. Otherwise this is a definite no buy to you.			",34,6,0,9,8,0,6

												Very short game but enjoyable. 4 stories and you decide the fate of those involved. I played it through multiple times to see how the different choices changed the story and to get all the achievments (will take a minimum of 3 playtrhoughs to get all achievments). If looking for a game to pass some time with an interesting concept and choices I recommend giving this one a shot.			",523,151,25,89,129,2,92

												1h42 minutes. That's how long it took me to finish that game 100%, get all the achievements, and looking into every nook and cranny to get all the dialogs. This is not a RPG, at all. This is an adventure game, a story, where you make decisions. Those decisions are pretty much limited to 4 binary choices, kill or don't kill. They don't change much of anything, just a comment in the epilogue.The only thing here is the story and deciding the fate of the characters. There's pretty much no story, just looking at a slice of life of 4 elderly people at the end of their rope (and it's possibly all a dream anyway). The characters are uninteresting, shallow, and often unoriginal. There's a lot of pee and poop ""jokes"" (not sure if they're supposed to be jokes), and nearly everyone is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.I couldn't care less about the characters, and the only thing here is to decide what happens to them (which might not actually do anything anyway). That makes it really pointless.And short. Which is probably a good thing, now that I think about it. Since it felt like a waste of time, it's better that way. It's not horrible, but it wasn't enjoyable or interesting or memorable to me.Now I'm going to let it run a few hours to drop the cards and uninstal it forever. I supposed it's a cheap way to get trading card even if the game itself isn't all that good.			",333,150,1,87,41,1,85

												Greyfox is another game that has been added to the RPG Maker Library. For the most part, this game isn't really that bad. You play as a 35 year old lady who is going into an early retirement. She moves to a town called Greyfox, named accordingly because of the giant, gray fox statue in the middle of the city.The enviroment offers lots of interactable objects, but with an RPG game with no combat, it's all about the story. You stumble upon a woman with magical powers. Suddenly you find yourself inhabiting the bodies of other townspeople at crucial moments in their lives. It could use some work and some originality, but overall this game is pretty fun for just a cents. If you're really into RPG games the $2 full price is fine, but if your just looking for something to occupy you for a few hours wait until it's on sale.			",481,149,14,40,47,10,76

												Greyfox is a story about a woman who 'takes control' of her life and moves to a new town. There she meets a rather interesting woman who gives her the power to make decisions. Depending on the decisions you make, determines how the story ends. The game is built upon the idea of taknig a look at 4 different people's lives that could be viewed on the surface as kind of bad. There is a good little bit of detail in this one town game that changes based on which life you are exploring. While some of the assets are stock, it really doesn't make much of a difference, the stories are interesting enough that you don't really notice them unless you really care about that sort of thing.The Achievements are pretty easy to get, and seeing the different endings is actually interesting. The music is pretty good, but depending on how long you play could get irritating. Most importantly, the dialogue in the game is pretty good. You can tell the authors put some thought into the game. I would recommend it if you have time for a short 2 hour game to explore, unless you aren't interested in the concept. There are no battles, do don't get your hopes up. This is not a traditional RPG Maker game.One tiny gripe is the devs couldn't figure out how to make F12 not reset the game to the title screen. No screenshots for you. :/Overall for the price tag it carries, it's worth getting and playing. For an RPG Maker game definite 6/10			",2283,873,58,239,248,14,283

												First and foremost, I think what needs to be said about this game is that it an exploration game, (Similar to To The Moon, Ib, Mad Father, etc.) that means that this is NOT a JRPG. This isn't mentioned anywhere on the store page, and saying the game was inspired by Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 3 definitely doesn't help prove this.Now onto the actual game, I can't really criticize the gameplay since there's very little actual gameplay. It's just walking about, talking to people, and inspecting objects. I honestly feel that any engine, other than RPGMaker, would be better for games like this, but I guess ease of use makes RPGMaker so prevalent.So that means what I need to critcize this game on is it's story. To put it blunty, this game feels like it was written by someone who has a very black and white view on morality. Your character decides to move to a town that's famous for an old folk's home, but you run into a mysterious lady that says you should leave. You end up going to sleep, then wake up in a dream world where your character is now old and you then see the world through 4 different people that live in the same town. You spend a day in their life and then need to decide if you should kill them or not. For the most part, everyone, expect for one person, is painted in a horrible light so you'll want to kill them.The entire premise of the game, felt at odds with each other. The beginning has a weird magicial element to it (They never explain why a magical entity wants someone to not live in this town.), then it just transistions into normal character driven short stories, where the writing for each, with the exception of the nurse, just feels bland and boring (The nurse's story is just spastic and makes no sense.). It's on par with stuff you'd see on a fanfiction site.  Also, despite being less than 2 hours of content, I often wanted to just stop playing this and go play, or read, something else.Then there's 3 endings. If you killed no one you get the good ending, where you just leave town and go back home. If you kill atleast 1 person, but not all 4, you get the mediocre ending where you leave town, but end up needing psyciatric help. Finally, the bad end where you kill all 4 people where you end up in a mental institute.Each ending ends with your character not living in the town, which doesn't make much sense, they quit their job to get away from the hustle of the city and, for some reason, moving to a town requires intervention from a magical being to make the character stop from making that mistake. Unless the character is just actually just crazy, but eitherway it's still not a compelling enough.TL;DR: I applaud the dev for trying to make a dramatic story about moral choices, but they lacked the writing skills required to make a good story. Meaning this game's only real use is making a profit off the cards.			",321,99,3,32,21,2,19

												A little short sweet RPG that puts you into the bodies of different strangers that shows what their life is like from their point of view. As the saying goes, you don't know a person unless you walk a mile in their shoes. Very easy game to play, and to get all achievements, for those achievement hunters out there.The story seems too short, but that is my only main complaint. I did not find any bugs, and the game is pretty solid. Anyways, i recommend it for the storylines, and if your a achievement hunter, for them.			",141,67,0,101,29,0,11

												TL;DRGreyfox RPG is not necessarily a ""bad"" game, but it's not good either. It's not the worst rpgmaker game on steam, but it doesn't have much content to be interesting or give a lasting impression.What I like best in Greyfox RPG is the theme. You basically control 4 different characters in the game and make choices about whether you think they should live or die. It's an interesting mechanic and idea, especially because it's unique, but that's about the best the game has to offer. Graphics are fairly basic for this kind of game, though by no means ugly, and dialouge is just okay. Gameplay is dull though. You do little besides walk around, talk to people, and collect items. It's not a bad system by any means, but if the characters and story are bland, which in all honestly, they are, it's a bad idea to have little gameplay. Each full playthrough, if taking your time, will last about an hour or so. I did a speedrun for leftover achievements which took about 20 minutes. I would not recommend this game unless it's onsale, and even then I'd recommend it for seeing the theme of the game (which would be great for psychologial/thriller types) or for the easy 100% or trading cards. It is somewhat misleading to call it an RPG because it gives the player a certain expectation in their mind. This game, while having an interesting concept, does not utilize it to its fullest potential. At the end especially, it tries to be deep and complex, but gives no reason or explanation why the player should care. I will say though, that the 2+ hours I spent on this game was a waste of time for me.			",61,87,0,23,9,0,7

												Greyfox is sort of a role playing game... in that you assume the roles of various characters throughout the game. It's basically like a point and click adventure type game, but instead of pointing and clicking you have RPG type controls and environments. The basic plot is that you, the main character, get sick of your day to day life. You decide to quit your job and move to the small town of Greyfox, which is inhabited mainly by elderly people. You quickly get into a scenario where you are forced to live a day in the life of someone in town. This happens multiple times. This is essentially all you do in the game, without going into spoiler terrirory about what happens with each character.The gameplay, as mentioned, is basically going around, examining the environments, talking to people, getting items, and trying to use items to complete tasks within the game. Some things can be missed but others are necessary to progress. You will get to pick different options in some dialogues. The answers sometimes have consequences and sometimes don't matter. At the end of each day, you get to decide whether the character you've played as lives or dies. After all the days, there's a final cutscene and the game ends. I liked how the game played, as opposed to actual point and click games. The RPG playstyle and art style helped me get into it more than some visual novel or point and click adventure normally would. I also like how the game gives you choices that may or may not matter. In fact, and this may be a bit of a spoiler but it doesn't really matter ultimately, in the end all of your choices have no true consequences aside from how you personally feel about them. This is a pretty cool idea, to let you feel how you want to about what you've chosen as the fate of these people. The way you play is determined by your own set of values moreso than those of the developers. It's also nice to play some depressing games now and then. It's not necessarily a happy ending, but it can be as long as you feel like it is. It's just a neat little concept.On the downside, there's also no true goal of this game. The rather aimless nature is strung along by a few integral decidions that you have to make and actions you have to do in order to move on. You can't really lose the game. So there's no real goal here. There IS replay value to see what happens if you do different things, but there's not a lot of incentive when it goes against your own values to make such choices, especially in a game that is so fueled on such choices. Also, many times during the game certain places will be closed off to you. This doesn't feel like it's all that natural. It just seems like they didn't program interesting things in those areas for the entire game so only areas where you'd need to go are programmed in. It's okay, but feels a little lacking and as though it's trying to herd you in the right direction... in a game that's about exploring the world in other people's shoes. Also, a minor complain about the art. I like it, but it seems like a lot of it is just assests from some RPG maker. Not a big deal in terms of the story and atmosphere, but still a little lazy on some of it.Overall? Greyfox is a fun, interesting little game. It'll probably only last you one to two hours to finish... which means you'll either want to achievement hunt or idle it to get the card drops. It's not for everyone, and I wouldn't call it an RPG, but if you like the concept of exploring the lives of old people and choosing their fate, then look into it. Is it worth the full 5 bucks? I would say no, personally. BUT, if you can get it for around 50 cents or less, it's definitely worth a shot. Maybe a dollar if you're really interested. It's just not long enough or deep enough to be worth full price. Greyfox gets a 5 out of 10 for being a fun, interesting little adventure where personal values and investment in the characters really pay off.			",222,48,1,22,12,3,19

												I kept thinking there had to be more to this game.I kept looking for it.There was nothing else to be found.Pro:At $.19 USD, it's not overpriced.Cons:There was no sinister secret as you are given to believe.Characters were nothing but clichés of the elderly, caregivers and calous medical personnel. There was too little time invested in any character for any of the choices to be truely ""tough"" choices. ",203,60,12,34,11,2,17

												I really wanted to like this. Greyfox isn't a bad game, but it isn't a good game either. The themes of the game (actions have consequences / aging) would normally make this something I'd jump at but neither were well realised. It took me less than 2 hours to play through the game enough times to unlock all the achievements, while I'd normally prefer to spend more time enjoying the story in a game like this.I picked this up in the JRPG bundle at 90% off, and while that was a good purchase, there are other JRPGs that I would recommend over  this one.

The Crunch Not an extensive measure to say here. It's a RPG Maker entertainment without fight. You move with the move keys and push a catch to interface with people and things. There are choices in substance boxes. You can accumulate money, be that as it may you needn't trouble with more than $20. There's a driving range in any case. It wasn't evil, in any case I totally ran a man over in the bicycle way and nobody gave it an apprehension. There are some reused assets nearby new ones, in any case I wasn't exorbitantly pained (It was truly kind of fascinating that the Clergyman from Last Dream was recast to play a shocking agent, and I'm practically sure the last legendary being Helios played the entombment benefit home official). Thoughtful probably, and I beat it in 90 minutes. Like, the whole redirection. I know there are trade endings et cetera, however that is an entirely hitting move these days with a non free entertainment. I trust it's advocated paying little heed to my 3$ regardless, and I'll disclose to you why in the help. The HelpSignificantly, Greyfox is significantly more like a point and snap encounter beguilement than what we usually call a RPG. In spite of the way that not under any condition like most RPGs I play, this is a Redirection where you Accept a Section. I genuinely wandered into this present legend's shoes and felt her fear, shock and slightness. You settle on choices, yet they don't have any kind of effect in the sentiment expanding incredible/deceptive powers, or opening a sexual minute with a space outcast. They matter since they make me feel sad and uneasy, in light of the way that they're affecting the soul of the saint and the lives of the all inclusive community she judges. (Minor spoilers from here on) The story begins with you playing a woman who has as of late halted. Abandoned her place of work, desert her townhouse and spend whatever is left of her life in a retirement bunch named Greyfox. After a short driving game plan, she connects at the town and after that exclusive kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥about until a room opens up. There is a course of action of (subjective as condemnation) events to progress clearly however for the most part it feels truly open. She makes easygoing chitchat with the occupants and they're for the most part altogether negative. Now and again hopeless, typically fascinating however always kind of a downer and obviously not what the saint was reckoning. Unavoidably she get's a room, quits, and dreams about an odd woman. Interesting Woman(that's what the delight calls her) turns the legend old, and offers her the chance to encounter the lives of four old people and pick their conclusive fate. Beginning here the story resembles a (to some degree) less gutless and essentially more create retelling of Stories From the Mausoleum, where Bizarre Lady is the Tomb Chief and you are the astringent incoherency. I won't destroy whatever else, however each of the four stories are likewise fascinating, abandoned and frightening even while they keep up a substitute tone and feel for the limited size and degree. The trade is no Planescape: Torment yet in the meantime it's lightyears before Last Dream. The composed work is clear, clean and passes on most of the significance it needs to, paying little mind to the likelihood that it can be a bit on the nose(Mysterious Lady really seems like the Tomb Orderly every so often). The story is told in a morally fair, documentarian plan. There is no teach or recovery, simply point, affect, and what you can live with. This can be somewhat conflicting with the visuals; even by RPG Maker gages, no doubt a crappy looking SNES delight. The Saint's model looks uncommon. It passes on a lot of expression in somewhat number of developments and representations. Most of substitute models are way less unsurprising be that as it may, and the UI is straight up shocking. This didn't impact my being affected by the story, yet it was off putting at first. The Choice This beguilement look like Constantly Once in a while Mammoths had a youngster with I Have No Mouth And I Ought to Yell. It's not on a standard with either, and I know numerous people will be put off by the brief traverse it takes to finish, yet I can say without exaggeration that not a lot of bits of story, also video games, made me feel so significantly.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time. In my religion, this is known as Art(TM), but you can call it ""Threewording"") ",324,44,31,27,29,2,48

												Greyfox is a short RPG-Maker adventure with a modern setting and a pretty original take on storytelling: as the unnamed female protagonist you'll come to briefly experience the life of four other people and ultimately judge them.PROS:-interesting story that doesn't shy away from adult themes (death,murder,etc)-the ""inhabiting the bodies of other people"" gimmick works quite well as a storytelling medium-the town of Greyfox, while small, has quite a bit of things and people to interact withCONS:-as most RPG-Maker games its graphics, sounds and music are quite forgettable-very short, can be completed in less than an hour-the choices you're given and the endings they'll unlock seem somewhat rushed and a bit lacklusterGreyfox's choice of giving us the chance to control several characters, getting to know them and eventually decide their fate is what makes the game quite interesting: the themes you'll meet while playing give the game an overall mature feel as it surely backs away from the usual ""fantasy world with elfs and orcs"" games one usually gets with RPG-Maker.Sadly the short length diminishes the strength of the story and the choices you'll make: the characters you'll control will be with you for 10/15 minutes each and it's difficult to properly connect with them in such a short time: the last dialogue and three endings also feel a bit too rushed to properly give a meaningful closure. A longer game and a bit more courage in setting up the endings would have made a better use of the good story and its characters.I got Greyfox for 20 cents and, at that price or anything around the 1$ mark, the story alone is well worth a playthrough or two if you don't mind its short length.

												Alright. Now, hear me out first. The reason why I'm giving a ""No"" for this game it's because the story had a lot of potential, but the game fails to reach it. I liked, not gonna lie. But the development, gameplay and dialog could've been better, even with the RPG Maker Engine. The characters deserved more attention, more detail, to intensify the game choices. And the ending, sadly, was king of rushed through. Not giving the player the satisfaction of finishing it. Overall, it's a ""ok"" game. But I recommend you to buy it (if it suits you) on a promotion, or something like that.			",180,71,0,27,5,1,14

												I don't really ""recommend"" this game, but I'm leaving a positive review because I don't mind it either.This is an RPG Maker game that uses a lot of rtp graphics and sounds. Some people think those games shouldn't be on Steam at all. I disagree. I believe that as long as effort was put into it, it's cheap, and the writing is decent, it deserves to exist. Greyfox meets all those requirements, so if you're interested, don't feel bad about checking it out. It's somewhat unprofessional, but harmless.My only real complaint is that it should not have mentioned Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy in the description considering it is in no way similar to them.

												I really, really wish I could give this game a positive rating, but I can't. There's nothing really here worth buying. Most of the art is subpar, and the stuff that isn't came from a pre-made asset pack. The writing isn't very good either. And the gameplay is almost nothing deeper than, run around spamming space bar until you win. Not only all of that, but the game is extremely short(I beat it in about an hour and a half). And lastly, I've heard two songs throughout the entire game, one that loops regardless of where you are and what you're doing, and one for a very specific scene that is not only completely uneccesary to experience to complete the game, but only last about 2 minutes.I look forward to seeing if the developers of this game move on to something better, because this game is so close to being good.

												This is a very weird game.  It's barely a game at all, really, more a series of very short choose your own adventure stories.  It has a presentation that is very reminiscent of David Lynch, with an exploration of the dark side of a small town, and strange events that are ambiguously presented as either nightmares, mental illness, or the supernatural.   It isn't terribly written, but it never really drew me in.  I got it on sale in a game pack, so it was like 25 cents or something, and for that, it was a fine way to kill an hour if you have nothing better to do.  I would prefer a neutral rating if there was such a thing, because it's sort of like when you buy a sandwhich you haven't tried before, and you don't dislike it, but you don't like it either.  Like you wouldn't really suggest anyone else try it, and you wouldn't eat it again, but it was edible and inoffensive, and it served its purpose as a lunch.			",179,35,1,51,6,0,8

If you could see the life of others through their own eyes, would you play God?I have mixed feelings about this game so I'd give it a hesitant recommendation. The game is more of an exploration where you talk to people and trigger events. I have no clue as to why this game has the same style as that of Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 3 except for the sprites graphics.I got annoyed when I played this game without a guide since it relies heavily on exploration and talking to people to the point you won't even know the objectives of the game. It'll make you guess it and gives you frustrations later. Although the story is nice and short which is a plus, considering topics and games like these aren't meant to be drag-on for hours and hours. Minor choices doesn't really affect the game. (I'm not talking about the major ones) While I was trying to get 100% achievement on Greyfox I tried all possible combinations in the dialogues and there's really only 2 sentence difference not much will happen. If you're going for a story-driven game might atleast make the substories that will branch out.I got this game really cheap and I was entertained a bit but I also had frustrations while playing the game hence, the hesitant recommendation.RatingFun-factor: ★★☆☆☆Atmosphere: ★★★★☆Story: ★★★☆☆Soundrack: ★★★★☆Average: ★★★★☆			",410,121,2,81,31,1,37
