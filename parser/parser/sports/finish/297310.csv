Early Access Review
								DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU HOPE TO START STOMPING AND PILE DRIVING AWAY.This game is in SUPER early access Alpha stage.So far there is only one playable wrestler with only 2 attacks, basic punch and a grappling brain buster.There is no BGM or Sound FX. So if you want music, be prepared to launch the Steam music player. LOL.If you buy this game now, the only benefit you will get is being a part of the development process and helping give the devs input on what they can add and do to improve the game.I honestly think this game won't be finished for at least another year or so. But at least the devs got the foundation done.They are at least honest enough to admit that what the game offers now is extremely limited, in it's beginning stages and nowhere near done.Let's just hope the devs come through and don't pull an incident like the devs of The Stomping Land... smh, everytime I think of that game.But if the devs for Pro Wrestling X pull through, we are in for a bada$$ wrestling game to look forward to in the future. :DRemember buying this game now is at your own risk.Good luck to the devs making this game.

								READ FIRST: Recommendation is conditionalThe developers have a lot of passion for pro wrestling, but progress can be very slow. It is a very small team that is working on this game. They are definitely working, slowly but surely. But only buy it at this point if you want to watch how a wrestling game is made. This is nowhere near a full release yet, and there's no estimation on when that might be. Some people have been following this game for over a year. Do not buy this if you're looking for the full experience. Updates have become more frequent in the last month or so. Which means more holds have been added as well as basic blood.The developers have an active Twitch account and they send out emails every week to their followers detailing their progress.As of this writing, current features include:-3 Wrestlers (2 masked and 1 basic unmasked default)-A ring editor (change ropes, mat, posts, apron color)-A wrestler editor (mix and match parts from the 3 premade wrestlers available)-Basic Grappling, Strikes, Submissions and Pins (very small movesets so far)-Blood was just added (static splotches, not dynamic or physics based)-Screenshot mode-Options menu-Controller support (xbox 360 controller)-Turnbuckle moves-Crowd-Stage			",159,6,36,11,15,1,6

								It's barely a video game at this point, and this is 9 years into development. You click play, it drops you in the ring, you can do a suplex, punch, or pin. That's it. That's the entire game. You can't lose, the enemy can't pin, and it doesn't even count to 3. There's just a random coin toss when you pin someone that if you win or he kicks out.I get that it's early access, but this is a concept stage at best. This is the sort of thing one guy could do in a few days and it's costing you $9.99 on steam.Stay away and wait for it to come out. (if that ever happens)			",251,26,7,45,24,1,23

Early Access Review
								Pro Wrestling X is a very difficult game to like, at the moment of this review it's as basic and bare bones as can be humanly possible.  The game is rather stiff feeling, and clearly needs quite a bit of animation work to bring it in line with the intended dream of making a modern day version of the Aki series of wrestler games from the late 90's back to life.  If you had a Nintendo 64 and were into wrestling (when wrestling was at it's peek, you played some of those Aki games)  you played some of those games.  Whether it was the huge rosters, or the ability to create some of your favorite super stars (Was really easy to create characters that resembled their real life counterparts because the graphics were kind of poo poo and blurry)  you played them like they were going out of style.  I'm sure many people like myself popped in your gameshark and fired up some codes, change the ring mat, unlock extra wrestler slots as permanent wrestlers who didn't count against the CAW slots, heck I even seem to recall unlocking The Big Show wrestle-mania 2000 after he was removed from the game and sent back down to OVW for his weight issues.    With that said, Pro Wrestling X has a long way to go before it begins to even slightly resemble the Aki games, but (almost always a but)  the developers have passion, and seem to be trucking away.  (Rather slowly but the project isn't abandoned)  Does the game need work, in the words of the immortal Stone Cold Steve Austin..  ""Oh hell yeah"" but I think given the time and money this game could be a shining beacon of success..   With that said, if you don't buy into the dream you should avoid this product until a later date.  I would call this game more of a demo version, rather than a full fledged game.  You can play it for sure, but using the same 3 wrestlers and 1 wrestler you can edit gets boring, the lack of fluid in the motions is nothing like the Aki games which glided like a hot knife through butter. My personal hopes for the gameSure up character movements and animations, the buttons seem rather sluggish and that makes the game rather un-fun to play, I'm not personally sure if it's an animation issue or a button imput issue, but pressing a button and having the game wait 3 seconds to carry out that action makes the game feel much worse than it really is.Create more wrestlers, it gets really boring playing with 3 wrestlers...  If you had a bit more variety in wrestlers a person could overlook most of the technical limitations and still let the game carve out it's own niche.  As it stands right now, 3 generic masked wrestlers (albeit very well designed and cool looking wrestlers) leave the gamer saying meh, I don't really have any reason to play. Work on adding some additional match types, maybe a hardcore match with weapons would do the trick, give us fun things to do, which protect against the negative aspects of the game-play, until those issues get worked out.  Nothing major, but the more additions the less likely people will be to notice the glaring issues the game has.  Give us some replay value for the money we plunk down, meat and potatoes can be a good distraction.Add in some additional music tracks.. (I loved the one looping music track, absolutely loved it) the one track included was really awesome... like banging my head while throwing up my devil horns and banging my head awesome, but after it loops for the third time, you're left going... ugh, I don't think I like this song as much anymore.. Cut the music during the matches and add in some sound effects, I understand the music is there to cover the fact that no sound effects are in place for matches, but that will help immerse us in the product.  Is commentary of some sort planned for the future, I don't recall the Aki games having commentary, but at the very least including the mat hits, punches, kicks, and splats would go a long way. My recommendation I'm going to recommend this game (I know, I know, it sounds like I'm trashing it right?)  Well I'm not, I think the potential for a wonderfully amazing retro wrestling game is there, it's sitting there, a few updates and additions away from poking it's glam 80's metal hair band head out of the ring, throwing some punches, doing a few suplex's and telling the haters to SUCK IT!!!!  This game needs ALOT of work, it's a real mess right now, but it has potential, and developers who seem to care and have a real passion for bringing this dream to reality.If you aren't willing to support development and wait.. (probably a LONG LONG) time, I'd suggest not buying the game right now.  For people who want to make an investment and help fund and support a wrestling gamer fan's dream I'd fully recommend buying this game and waiting for a few more patches to really pass judgement.  The game's cost of $9.99, may seem like a lot compared to other games you can get on steam for the same price, but the major difference is none of them are aiming to deliver a preeminent throw back wrestling experience.   If you remember the attitude era, you remember DX telling everyone to SUCK IT!!!,  Manking winning the WWF championship and WCW spilling the beans live on the air, resulting on WWF Raw putting out some of their best ratings ever, this game will probably eventually have you feeling like Val Venus, (not when Val was having his member threatened by Kai n Tai, but when he was saying HELLLOOOO LADIES)  and loving it.. Trust me when I say, right now this game is like a new born baby, just starting to open it's eyes, seeing light for the first time, getting a robust slap on the behind to kick start the crying..  Just remember while you may feel like a loser for owning this game in it's current state, if someone tries to speak negatively about you because of it, just remind them, ""YOU WERE NUMBER 1 ONCE IN YOUR LIFE"" that glorious day you won the race up the birth canal.. Much like you developed into an amazingly talented young man, with a great job, a beautiful wife, and 2 1/2 adoring children, this game will eventually bloom into a beautiful flower.  If you don't have ADHD and expect it to get there over night.. or this year, or possible even in 10 years, just know it will probably get there at some point before the females at your favorite strip club begin to call you grey bush..

Early Access Review
								Before I get directly into my review I'll post some information so a person can really understand something about Pro Wrestling X.  The game has been in development for a very long time.  In fact it had a failed kickstarter over 3 years ago..  and was being talked about for a few years prior to the failed kickstarter  So we'll be kind and say it's been in development for 3 years, the store page says the release date was Nov 2014, but it's been in development for far longer than that. The game is supposed to mimic a the Aki styled wrestling games, WWF No Mercy, WCW vs NWO, etc etc etc..  These games came out over 16 years ago!!!!  16 year old tech.Unfortunately for Pro Wrestling X, the long development time hasn't translated into a good game, or much of a game at all.  The game is in Early Access because of that some wiggle room should be given, but with each successive patch the game gets closer to it's full release, the current patch 0.94, seems to suggest the next patch will be the one that takes it out of Early Access. This game is no where near ready for full release, it has a grand total of 3 wrestlers....  3!!!!,,  The movements and controls are stiff and kind of rancid in all honesty.  Aki games were smooth, fluid, and even though the graphics weren't all that good, the games were amazingly fun to play. This isn't a game as much as a concept, it's like a tech demo of something someone would put togther to show off what they wanted to do in a finished product.  The game features 3 match types, single vs single, triple threat and a 4 way.   The game has 3 wrestlers and 1 CAW slot wrestler that you can edit.When judging this game it needs to be understood that this is a game based on tech from 16 years ago...  I can't fathom how this project can be so bare bones, unpolished and unfinished as it's been in development for over 3 years.  I can't hate on the developers though, they have passion, and really talk like they want to make a memorible game, unfortunately I think this should have stayed as someone's pet project, it really doesn't belong on steam.  I'm not sure if the problem is a lack of developers, a lack of money, lack of time or some combination of all of them.I think at this point any new comers should be very leary about buying into this idea, the developement time is running at a snails pace, and you could very well see your 10 dollar investment turn into a 10 dollar loss.  As a hugh Aki fan it saddens me that this game is in such a poor state, I think it's a safe bet to assume many of gamers are tired of the same old garbage WWE game which gets released yearly which feels super arcady.  We want a real simulation wrestling game, and unfortunately Pro Wrestling X isn't going to be that game... atleast not for quite a few years, if at all.. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								EDIT: So I will update this since apparently since some guy sucking up to the developers is going around posting ""oh this is outdated! This game is actually updated now!!!"" on every single outdated review, and the dev is bragging about updating now.  This game has changed a little since November.  There are a few new moves, a momentum meter, and basic AI logic.  Those are your ""many updates"" you're parading around and bragging about.  That's what's been added in the last 9 months. There have been excuses as to why development has been slow and I understand that things happen, but we're talking about the decision as to making a purchase here.  This game is $10.  It's been clear that people aren't necessarily purchasing a game, but a promise.  A small handful of updates recently does not absolve the huge gap of nothing but excuses.  $10 is purchasing a promise that is not guaranteed to come true and it is a HUGE risk to buy in on this promise that has a long history of disappointment and very little to show for it.I'm also sick of hearing this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t of ""We've been updating sometimes twice per day lately"" because I distinctly remember hearing something along the lines of 'we're updating more than most early access titles"" back in November.  That is just offensive. People bought in because of that statement thinking this was going somewhere and all we got were excuses.  You go and make this new statement and more people see some minor updates, buy in, and then what?  9 more months of excuses.  This game does not update frequently.  ARK: Survival Evolved updates frequently.  Getting to this minor milestone of being able to have a 1/2 star match after 9 months is not a worthwhile investment that should be recommended to potential buyers.  I'm sorry but it's not.  There's not even a manageable UI at this stage.  Discovering the controls is pure guesswork.  That should have been a priority above anything else. You added more moves without telling people how to actually DO them!Look, I get it, this is a small developer trying to make a big game, but Early Access is Early Access.  It has the good side and the bad side.  The good side are your games like ARK, that are updated daily, released in a playable semi-polished state that improves steadily.  Pro Wrestling X is the bad side of Early Access.  It's the game that goes on hiatus immediately after it becomes available for purchase, doesn't update for months, and after 9 months of development, has very little to show for it. I know ARK has a big team and all and PWX has like 2 and a half people, but it doesn't change the fact that they both have the same title of Early Access and one is worth the investment while the other isn't yet.I stand by my original review.  This game DOES have potential, but the promise of a game is just too risky to invest in at this point.  Bragging about updates and having pathetic white knights downvote and comment on outdated reviews does nothing to make this product worth purchasing.  It's only trying to hide and mask the current state of this game that's not worth investing in (in my opinion) so that more people will buy the game (because ""oh hey the bad reviews are downvoted, they must be wrong! Also, Updaetz!"")I will update the review when my opinion changes, and if that happens, it will bring me great joy.  I want this game to succeed but as of right now I do not recommend this game, and going around downvoting and posting on 5-month-old reviews does nothing to make me feel better about the product that I invested in as soon as it came on Steam.Original Review Below from March 30, 2015:Very basic and shows promise, but since the game was put on steam there have been *EDIT* A Few *END EDIT* updates and a whole bunch of empty promises.  Hopefully it gets better with time, but right now, I would recommend to stay away and just follow the game until it gets to something resembling the developers' vision.  It's not worth playing in its current state and it DEFINITELY isn't worth $9,99			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
