												great game that gives lots of fun! nice neon looks and tron-like feeling. you don't need a very large room as the ball always keeps coming back towards the player. it's a steal for not even 5.- bucks.			",118,35,4,2,35,3,2

												This simpleness of this game is what really makes it attractive.  Think racketball mixed with nitro.  The music is top notch and the sounds are very retro-chique.  Everything in the game seems to just flow really nicely and nothing seems out of place at all.  It's the perfect combo of a retro bartop arcade game, and a fast action VR game.  Basic controls and mechanics makes this really easy to pickup for 10-15 mins here or there and sweat it out a bit.  It really is a lot more work than it looks!
