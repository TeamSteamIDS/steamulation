												This game is good.This game is good!This game is good?Yep. Saviors, the 19 cent 2D shootemup, is good. I was not expecting this. No really, I was looking forward to tearing this game to pieces. Unfortunately for me, the only worthy complaint is the terrible character-models and bland art-direction. Once I actually played the game, it all came together quite nicely. This is a legitimately decent indie shooter.Humanity is doomed AGAIN, or maybe they're not doomed, or maybe I don't care. This threadbare and easily ignorable plot sets up 15 stages of shooting action. For an arcade 2D shooter, that's quite a lot. Thankfully, these stages are well-paced, with only 5 of them having real boss-fights. Furthermore, your first experience with this game is liable to be the story mode, where the large number of stages seems a bit more sensible.In story mode, you're given the choice of three pilots, each with their own ship. As you play through the stages, you'll gather experience, which leads to level-up perks. Also, in-between stages you can decide on primary, secondary, and side weapons. There's an interesting amount of strategy, that's tempered by good old-fashioned reflexes. The better you do, the higher your score, which also ties into your experience. The level of difficulty can also be changed, just in case things get too easy or too difficult. The other modes remove the stage to stage decision-making. Instead you're given a choice between various ships and weapon-systems. All you have to do is select the setup that suits your play-style.With Saviors, unlike most shooters, you always have an idea of what's approaching. There are constant indicators for every enemy ship, so you can focus on either destroying them immediately, or let them stay on-screen for a bit, so you can maintain your chain combo. Each ship has their own arsenal and pattern. As you progress you'll face newer ships in greater numbers. Another aspect that is unlike most shooters is the fact that you get a shield. Obviously it's not something to be relied upon, but it comes in handy for those stray shots. The boss-fights tend to be bullet-hell affairs. All you really have to do is hang back, fire away, and dodge for seemingly an eternity. For most players, the normal difficulty provides a sufficient challenge.Saviors has a good ""flow"" to it. There are new dangers or problems to deal with in every stage, but nothing too absurd that it changes the nature of the game. The mechanics are also fairly solid, none of the damage you'll take will feel cheap. Although, sometimes the game can get a little too busy with the explosions. On the bright side, this tends to happen during ""break"" mode, where enemies and their projectiles explode frequently. It's very satisfying, though sometimes tough to control.As far as other complaints go, I think bosses tend to take a little too long. Their last sliver of energy takes forever to drain away, even if I unload all of my limited secondary weapons on it. Each ship also has their own speed setting. While it's nice to have a faster ship for reaching enemies quickly; more often than not, I'd rather have slow-movement for those waves of bullets I need to dodge. Otherwise it's mostly nitpicks, like some perks not being very useful.Saviors is a very nice surprise. It has solid mechanics, a decent amount of variety, enough replay-value to last, and it will likely cost you a penny or two after selling the cards. It just might be worth your time.

About Star SaviorsInspired by Ikaruga, Raiden, and Radiant Silvergun, Saviors brings the best bullet hell experience you can find on Steam. Play through 18 challenging stages in this ultimate test of tactics and reflexes. The Graphics  	Buller hell games really don't need that much graphic power, with using simple meshes (like this game does) it works perfectly. But this just can't be overlooked, the character models are taken out of a nightmare, and just put in there to haunt you for the rest of your life. If you can just pass this simple detail, everything else is fine. The Music	Empowering, just the music it needs for the type of game it is. Mostly heard is metal, with a few dubstep sounds mixed within. If you love that kind of music, you are going to love this game.  The Story 	You as the reader, have probably heard this story over and over again, the story where you are the chosen one and you have to save the world. Now this may come as a suprise, but this game actually changes it (no it doesn't). You follow a relatively average campaign through the galaxy to prevent a war that is going to unfold at any moment. Also the game tells you multiple times that you are the chosen one, and that you are the only one who can do what you are doing. Although at the start of the campaing, you are given the choice between 3 characters, and while you are doing what you are doing, the other 2 characters are doing the same, but remember how you are the only one capable of doing this ? Well you are not. The Gameplay  Really fast paced, you don't have time to think about what you are going to do, as you are bombarded all the time. It does get progressively harder with every level, as it is expected. The bosses man were they hard, mostly that one at the 13'th level, but nothing a second (if only it were 2 tries) attempt couldn't fix. All in All  Star Saviors	 is a very nice Action Game!9/10 From MeSweep ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At first glance the game looks like something made in 1995 and upscaled to HD. The price is also suspiciously low. But don't let that fool you, because Star Staviors is a surprisingly decent and well made indie shmup, with a lot to offer.The game is clearly inspired by some of the more popular titles in the genre, in a good way. It is simple and easy to get into, yet offers numerous game modes, difficulties, ship types and weapons to choose from. From what I've played on normal it seems fair, and the controls are responsive enough. The challenge is there, the shooting is enjoyable, and numerous achievements and modes encourage multiple playthroughs.The game surely is not perfect and could have been improved in some areas, but as a whole it is really good. Simply put, I've had a lot of fun with with it. More so than with many other shmups, that are way more expensive and more hyped up. Great and catchy soundtrack also certainly adds a lot to the overall enjoyment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The CG avatars are bad.  Even the animation.  Why would they go that route when 2D animation would have served the same function and looked way better? I guess it doesn't matter when your game is just genuinely fun.  Distilled Bullet-Hell Shmup.  You can check out my Let's Play here:

Things I love in shmups.  Power-ups and Bosses.  Refreshingly, the power-ups you choose don't stay anchored to you.  You're free to mix it up before any level.  You earn new power-ups by performing better in the level via score and score multipliers. It's a pretty simple formula.  If you do well, fun++.I only went against a few bosses, but they all had their own patterns that required to be learned.  It's very easy to recommend Saviors if you like Shmups / Bullet-Hells.

												SAVIORS~~~~~~~ Saviors is a Space Shoot’Em up. Graphically the game is mediocre and to be honest should have look better in my opinion. Saying this, this game is extremely fun to play and offer several levels of difficulties from easy to insane and different modes of play.In the story line, you can change the primary, side and secondary weapons and upgrade you spaceship too at the end of each level.In terms of the soundtracks, it is ok.If you are looking for a fun space Shoot’Em up, this game is great fun.Positives:~~~~~~~~ -	Fun to play-	Several modes -	Plenty of achievements-	Trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~ -	Average graphicsOverall, I enjoyed it. 7/10MORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HEREFOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros: This game is very enjoyable and will bring a couple hours of fun (It varies on the difficulty chosen)Cons: +No actual online Co-Op, only Local (EDIT : Since this review has been posted, it has been changed to local co-op, which makes me smile, ty devs :D) +Some of the visuals, especially the avatars, look awful and would've looked better in 2D+The game isn't actually that long, and not that much replayability Diagnosis - Get it on a sale (at .19c, it was a steal), but if you have the money it might be worth it if you're into bullet hell shooters.

												I entered this game expecting a generic, bad shoot'em'up, and what I got was insane, pure madness!! It's amazing, sure it does need better graphics but the gameplay is amazing and the soundtrack oh.... those tunes..I got it on a discount but it's definitely worth full price, and while here get the Soundtrack too, it's amazing and much better than those crappy tunes you get on iTunes for $0.99!

												A very fun bullet-hell shooter. Excellent hit detection (which is crucial to these games) and a great assortment of upgrades available. I do wish they had went with static images instead of the 3D heads though. Good soundtrack as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Aside from the really creepy human faces, and the blerb's insistence that this is ""the best bullet hell experience you can find on Steam"", it's not terrible. But I don't get a feeling of... impact from it. The sound design doesn't support the visuals enough, so I'm left feeling like I'm playing a video game quite a long time ago, not like I'm having an experience. As part of a bundle or otherwise discounted, it's a fine bit of nostalgia, but if you're paying cash moneys for a new twist on the good ol' arcade shooter, I'd go with Crimzon Clover World Ignition or Titan Attacks, personally.
