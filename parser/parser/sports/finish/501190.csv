												Oh where to begin...Up front:  The Pros here are outnumbered by the cons.  Do not buy unless you understand two things.1.  This is not anywhere near as good as Madden was well over a decade ago.2.  You're not paying for a superior football simulation so much as helping a (tiny!) developer create an alternative to EA.Pros:-Decent number of mod options apparently available.  None used so far, just the game ""out of the box.""-Franchise mode! For when you're in it for the long haul.-Quick Play mode...for when you want a...quickie.-Passing game control using mouse is easy/intuitive and innovative. Allows you to put the ball where you want.-Good audible and hot route system, but no option to simply flip play direction at the line of scrimmage.-32 teams to choose from...wonder how they arrived at that number...Bugs/Cons/Gripes:Complaints and negative generally fall into the three categories below:  gameplay, graphics and sound.Gameplay:-No sense of physical inertia in the game at all.  When there is a collision, players simply fall down at the point of contact.-No substitutes.  The players on the field are who you have, period.-No injuries-No fake punts or fake field goals-There is only a small difference between how a lineman looks and handles on defense versus a defensive back.-No defensive audibles.-No real options/special moves available if playing as a defensive lineman...or any defensive player for that matter.-No instant replay or option to record matches.-In a game with 10 minute quarters there was a grand total of ONE broken tackle.  Spins and jukes are basically useless.-Announcer is bland, repetitive and sounds like he is referring to powder puff football.-Quarterbacks can throw the ball 95 yards in the air.-Scale of field to players is off.  Field feels like it is 30 yards wide, not 43 and change.-Far too many dropped passes.  -Zero receiver animation in some cases, the ball simply bounces off a guy with arms at his sides.-In first (only) game played, my QB had over 40yds rushing...but had no rushing stats.-NO PLAY CLOCK.  What time is it?  Tea time you say?  I'll leave my boys at the line of scrimmage for a half hour then!-Game clock only moves 10 seconds at a time after a play.  My team had 130 plays in a 40 minute game.-Zero indication of when a quarter has come to an end other than looking at the clock.-No wind or wind indications, even in the kicking game.-Kicking and punting controls make it much easier to kick to the right than to the left.-TINY PLAYBOOKs.  All teams have same playbook with a total of up to 8 plays for each of the half dozen formations.-On punts, kickoffs and incomplete passes, THE BALL DOES NOT BOUNCE when it hits the ground!?!  (#VelcroBowl2016) Graphics:-Wideout animations are odd before the snap and freeze to the point they don't look alive till the snap occurs.-Runner animations have a very high center of gravity and wierd arm movements.  (Special Olympics, is that you?)-Quarterback animation upon dropping back is same goofy one from Axis '15.  Zero NFL QBs act/look like they're chilling at the disco. Once you notice, you can't un-notice.-Crowd sprites would not be awful if they had more than two colors and weren't in the shape of the stadium seats!-1920x1080 resolution looks like 1024x720Sound:-Announcer bland, repetitive and annoying.  Zero references to team, field position, player name.-After playing one game, started a second but quit out of annoyance because of a wierd persistent ringing tone.Closing Thoughts:I played a quick match to generate this review and quit during the second quick match because of a game bug.  Despite the fact I won that first game 43-42 in overtime on pro difficulty, there were far too many shortcomings for it to be a satisfying gaming experience.  I love playing football in real life, watching football on TV, playing football on consoles.  I want to like playing football on the PC.  Axis Football 2016 as a competitor to EA just is not there yet.  We're not talking not in the same league, zip code, area code, state...no my friend, that would be too kind. We're talking in terms of a pseudo third-world video game in comparison virtually across the board here.  This is the kind of game that cohabitates the abstract space occupied by AK-47s and angry black people shooting other angry black people.  This game had to learn DirkaDirka on the same streets as the neighborhood suicide bomber before it came across the border into the US, got on to Steam without a photo ID and voted 3,000 times in Florida and Idaho as an undocumented democrat.  (I can't resist, it's an election year)The feature set that is in place is decent enough, but the core gameplay itself is so unengaging and flawed that I would have to force myself through a season, and that's something I've never had to do going all the way back to the age of Tecmo.  With ALL that said, I hate EA.  I hate EA enough to shave my chest hair and eat it if they would simply stop being EA.  I hate EA enough to give this tiny developer a thumbs up despite the fact their game probably doesn't deserve it.  The effort put forth here IS somewhat praiseworthy for all the negatives.  Football is not simple to simulate as compared to say, golf, and EA has had large, well-funded teams refine their product over many years.  I want to support an alternative to EA very badly, but I also need to write a review that gives prospective buyers an idea of what they are purchasing.  Do I regret paying $20 for this game?  Kinda.  If it were just the game, oh my yes.  If it were just the game itself being judged, it is worth 5-10 bucks in my book.  But you're not just buying a game, you're buying hope for the little man and hope for a rebirth of football on the PC that isn't run by the cash-grabbing *BLEEEEEP* at EA.  All that said, odds are you're gonna want something better too, even with the lowered expectations from this review - you have been warned.In the end, (<-that's this part of the review->) I give Axis 2016 only a 5 out of 10 but a thumbs up for heading in the right direction...that and not being EA.

												I want to start off my review by saying simply, you CAN get the regular NFL uniforms and current roster as a mod and this is the link (so you don't go digging around like I did): http://axisgames.proboards.com/thread/35/nfl-experience-2016-mod-availableInstallation is simple, a video is provided even if you can't figure it out. Now time for the review.Pros:-A Madden alternative-Developers and a few modders display commitment towards creating a good Madden alt that attempts to excell where the current game does not.-The QB throwing dynamic is amazing. Not only do you have to find the open receiver, you have to aim correctly. It's more difficult but more rewarding as it feels realistic. -Kicking is not as easy and it feels great. You have to balance your power with accuracy, where in Madden of course you just kick it as hard as you can in the direction you desire.-There is potential for some awesome mods support, but it is currently lacking. As stated before you can mod the uniforms, team name, and roster. I think you can also edit the audible sound clips and the hot routes, and maybe more. I would really love the ability to add the correct schedule for our team as I want to play according to the actual NFL schedule. I'm sure graphics and animation mods would help too. Also individual adjustments to each QB voice would be VERY useful for modders. I would love hearing the actual voice of the NFL QBs as audibles are called.Cons:-Not as many options as Madden-Defense feels bland to play on-Animations and graphics are obviously well below Madden's but you really can't complain given the circumstances.-Mod support is not quite there yet.-No ability (as far as I am aware) to modify the schedule which this game needs IMO-Franchise mode is underwhelming. Needs more options and adjustments. Overall I recommend it for the QB/K play but mostly its potential. I'm not going to lie, I probably will continue to play far more Madden than Axis. However I think we really need some alternative so for that reason I will not request a refund in order to support the developers. If this game can achieve what it set out to do originally, I think it will thrive.To the developers please focus on Franchise mode a bit more for us that don't want to play multiplayer, this is one of the ways this game can really outshine Madden. Also consider some fun game modification settings for multiplayer like gravity adjustment, speed, slow-mo, etc. You should try and do everything that madden does not. Give this game some flavor that catches people's attention. Being on the PC is a huge plus, but not enough. I'm sure I speak for the rest of us when I say that I want this game to thrive. I don't want to spend $60 a year on what is essentially the same game with an updated roster and schedule. Give me a game that I can mod and update on my own, and release sequels every few years to upgrade graphics and mechanics... etc. Good luck and thank you!			",83,11,2,10,17,1,3

												A huge improvement over Axis Football 2015 with new animations,player moves,more modding such as team modding,stadium modding,new announcer,and franchise mode. More features are coming as well. This game still has a long way to go but just look at this years version and compare it to last. Supporting this game will mean even more improvements in the future. Lets support now for better options in the future.			",354,17,2,21,5,3,7

												I want to give as detailed and unbiased review as possible so no one is misled. I recommend this game not just because it's the only football game on steam, but also because this game has also showed a good amount of progress from last year's version. With that in mind, I'm not saying this game is perfect. This game is most likely slightly overpriced. Not as overpriced as 2015, which I couldn't see spending 15 dollars on. That price, is probably more fit for this game, and for '15, a cool $6-10 dollars. The game needs funding though, so overpaying isn't awful because Danny puts the money back into the game.Now, for the animations and features of the game. Jukes, Spins and Dives were added to the game which is an incredible upgrade considering in 2015 all you did was run. Which is upgraded in itself, your player no longer is holding the ball like he's asking for a defender to knock it out of his hand. He properly holds it like he has played football before. The UI also like the running animation, recieved a huge update and no longer looks as outdated. Blocking animations are improved now, engaging in a block is no longer engaging in a hug. There is a push mechanic that allows a better blocker/defender to be able to push back the opponent. A speed burst feature was added,(not sure if it was in '15) it's really unrealstic at the moment as players all speed burst at the same speed. There are real handoff and pitch animations instead of the ball glitching to the player. The playbook recieved a small upgrade, was hoping for even more of an upgrade I must point out. There are 8 plays for each formation, Not sure how many formations there are, I believe around 7-8 for each side of the ball. Franchise mode is not implemented and is the same as '15, very simple and nothing other to do besides play games. Full 4 quarter games, instead of two halfs. The final part of the game, the gameplay. There are still some flaws, most noticeably happens in the passing game. No swat animation or catching animation means balls thrown in coverage are often times a coin flip. The lack of catching animations makes it hard for receivers to catch certain balls on the run. So you'll often have to throw them to a stop. DB's don't properly play the ball and will often times run behind the WR and sit there. DB's backpedal a set amount of time, which causes them to get burnt in coverage sometimes. No fouls in the game don't hurt, besides the lack of offsides. This means you can easily blitz around edge and get sacks. The most improved part of the game though is clearly the blocking. Danny did a great job in changing how awful blocking was in '15. Kickoffs no longer clump the players together in the center which means you can have fun in the return game. Including on punt returns. The best way to make defenders miss is to manually swerve/spin after you bait them in, opposed to using a spin or juke. No physics system in the game, so the player movement and ball carrier moves are real arcadish.PROS-Gameplay improvements since '15 (Money play removal, blocking AI is no longer complete garbage)-Football game on steam-Unique passing system-Controller support-Very moddable (Personal favorite is hot route mods) -Community feedback is listened too-10x better animations than '15Cons-pretty awful interactions in the passing game(Including defensive zone and man coverage AI)-Very simple franchise mode-Inability to make hot routes on defense (Was hoping for this feature)-No online multiplayer-Very small playbook -No penalties -Defense is pretty bland, feels like you have no controlThe game isn't great, but it's worth the $20 dollars if you're a football fan on PC, or just upset with the direction of madden.

What is Axis Football 2016?Axis Football 2016 is the second edition in Axis Games’ professional football sports simulation franchise.As an Australian who considers themselves to be an armchair football fan, I tend to anticipate every quality American football game that hits PC. Unfortunately, this has been an all too rare occurrence. There are very few viable options when it comes to football games that allow you to actually play the game. Gamers do have a few other options when it comes to actual sports management games. Sadly, EA has spat in the face of PC gamers by not publishing Madden on PC since 2008. This is naturally something that I am quite bitter about even though I realize Madden is as guilty of the ‘annual roster update’ issue.It Lacks the Official NFL LicensesLet’s get the potential deal breaker out of the way immediately. Because Madden controls the licenses for the NFL and they would cost much more than a small indie developer could afford Axis Football lacks official licenses. What this obviously means is that the team names, uniforms, etc. are not in the game. More significantly, it means that there are no official NFL players featured within the game. However, I believe that the developers have done a very reasonable job in attempting to replicate the real deal so far as teams and players are concerned. For example, one of my favorite NFL teams is the Seattle Seahawks. The Seattle team is called the ‘Seattle Warhawks’ in the team. Furthermore, although the Warhawks players are not given the same names as the real Seahawks players their attributes are a reasonable match to what last season’s Seahawks team was.Community ModsAlthough the game lacks officially licensed rosters there are community mods. That means although the game may lack official licenses that there are people within the game’s community who have dedicated themselves to creating a realistic experience. By this, I mean that there is an ‘NFL Experience 2016’ mod. This has been painstakingly created by ‘thesackmaster’ and several other community members. There is also a NCAA mod. You will find these two mods and others in the official ‘Axis Football Mods’ forum. There are other mods including create your own league starter kids, broadcast graphics, and stadium graphics downloads.The community is one of the game’s strongest points.It Can Be EducationalBeing Australian gridiron is not a native sport. Therefore, I find the game to be very complex. Consequently, anything beyond position names and basic functions has been beyond me. There are many so many technicalities within each play that trying to understand everything is difficult. I have often found myself taking an automatic option or coach’s pick in football games. However, I do not believe that this function is within the game. This may be perceived as a negative but I’ve personally found it to be a major advantage. By playing the game I am naturally increasing my understanding of formations and of the technical aspects that go into each player’s role within each given play. Therefore, I believe that the game deserves recognition as an easy and enjoyable way to learn American football.A Little Too Easy PerhapsArguably the greatest negative that I have encountered thus far is that the game is arguably too easy. In my second game, I ran the score up into the 70’s while my computer opponent put out a single touchdown. I am finding that this repeats itself and that the only scores the computer often makes are the fluke-like plays that are unstoppable. I’m finding that this may soon turn into a game where I target specific achievements to perfect the game and return for my dose of pro football action.The reason why I am finding it too easy is because the AI does not react – at least noticeably – to the same tactics being employed again and again. In one game I used blitz for every single play. Unless the quarterback dishes off the pass quickly enough I can generally get the sack as no one is there to cover the blitz. On offense, I prefer the long throwing game. I can generally always count on one of my receivers getting open but the occurrence on 1-on-3 (offense-defense) catches is far too common. I’ve thus far found that the likelihood of throwing an interception is far less than my single receiver catching the ball.However, I must suggest that I am finding the running game to be quite challenging. The majority of my big scores have been performed through the throwing game. I have yet to unlock the 200+ rushing yards in a single game. This may be because I’m not entirely familiar with the nuances required for the running game.Presentation and FeaturesThis is where the game is lacking most of all. The graphics are not at all current generation. The features are lacking in contrast to a fully fleshed out feature complete game (e.g. Madden).If I could have one wishlist item fulfilled on the next entry in the franchise it would be a complete franchise mode. I understand that there are other games on the market (the management simulators) that allow you to do this but it would be a fantastic feature. The current franchise mode is insufficient in this regard and feels as though it has only been implemented to give players an option besides single game quick matches. Although it’s a good thing that there is something else in the game its lack of depth is a little concerning.The Franchise is a Work in ProgressThe developers have an understanding that the game isn’t where they want it to be. What the game currently is an opportunity for PC gamers to get their football on. They have ideas and plans to implement what they want to. However, they are open to advice, feedback and even criticism (please make it constructive). They are a very hands-on development team and want to make their game the best that it can possibly be. In complete honesty, you have to start somewhere and what they have now is an already highly playable and enjoyable football experience.Is it Steamified?It certainly is. There are trading cards and Steam achievements. I would, however, like to see them do away with their mod forum and try and implement Steam Workshop compatibility. This would encourage mod makers to create content for the game. This would increase the activeness of the community which would work wonders for the game.VerdictAxis Football 2016 offers PC gamers the opportunity to play entertaining football games. The developers are willing to work with their community on the continued improvement of the game’s quality. If you’re a fan of American football, then the $20 investment is well and truly worth it.For similar reviews and your chance to win great giveaways please visit Steamified[www.steamified.com] ",2243,882,89,270,267,28,370

												Since 2005, Madden has been the only football game available. Many people agree that NFL 2K5 was and still is the best football game made, but EA snatched up the exclusive rights to the NFL and has had an iron grip on the property since. As a long time player of the Madden games, I have yearned for some competition for the franchise as they really have no one to push them. While Axis Football 2016 will not dethrone Madden, it’s a heck of a good start.Since EA holds the exclusive rights to the NFL, Axis is not allowed to use team or players names but they are allowed to have teams like the Chicago Grizzles and New England Volunteers. Luckily, the game is fully moddable and an NFL roster already exists. This also opens the door for legacy rosters which are not available in Madden.As far as the actual gameplay goes, it is somewhat rudimentary. If you’re looking for Madden levels of fluidity and polish, you won’t find that here. This being the games’ second installment, it’s not that surprising that there are still areas to be improved upon, and the developer seems quite active on the forums and dedicated to making this series as good as possible. I really didn’t have a problem with the minor jank that the game may have, but I do hope that there are some future balancing changes. There are some easily exploitable plays on both offense (I got 26 receptions with one WR) and on defense (6 sacks with a MLB). While I have my gripes with the game, these are all fixable, and really the game makes up for it in a big way: the passing game. When I talk about wanting competition for Madden and more innovation, the passing system in Axis is exactly what I’m talking about. Instead of having icons assigned to different receivers, you use the right thumbstick to direct where you want the ball to go. This system feels infinitely more natural than the standard icon passing since you can pass to a specific spot on the field and lead the receiver or throw it shorter if you want him to come back to the ball. This mechanic is just so intuitive and brilliant that I wouldn’t be surprised if Madden ripped it off.Axis Football 2016 is by no means perfect, but for PC players who have been craving a proper football game this is a great start. It’s not even so much that I recommend Axis 2016 based on what it is, but rather on what the Axis franchise can become going forward. I would say that it’s worth getting the game just to support someone who is trying to innovate and do new things with a genre that has largely been stagnant for the past decade. Will Axis ever be as big as Madden? Probably not, but it doesn’t have to be either. There is enough of a solid foundation here that I am excited to see where this franchise goes if it keeps improving and listening to community feedback. ",315,121,0,22,8,2,8

												This Game is Great fun!!I've been playing axis football since the 2014 version and the devs have taken a quantum leap forward. What started as an arcade-ish football game has matured into a real football sim. Graphics and animations are greatly improved.  Even though they are unable to use proprietary IP of real pro teams, they have done an excellent job producing a really awsome football game. Can't handle that, or  you don't like something, you can change it with easy modding tools. The community has already produced a complete re-skin to give you all of your favorite pro teams. The devs actually listen to suggestions and bug fixes. I say buy this game just to support them so they  can continue to improve the only PC football game there is. Its still a little light on franchise mode and lacks salaries, drafts, and other things we like to geek out on, but the core game play is the real deal. I love the PC freindly mouse passing. it makes you feel like you're really making the throw where and when you wanted to good and bad.   Once they implement on-line multiplayer, there will never be a need to play Madden again.			",101,9,11,15,6,1,11

												Axis Football 2016 does a few things right, but for American football fun you’ll be better served finding a copy of Madden 08 on Amazon.Total size on my hard drive: 1.4 GB+ Run mechanics. Well-implemented, with moves that are easy to execute.+ Kicking mechanics. With the right timing, some long kicks are possible.+ Good hot-route audibles.+/- Graphics are acceptable, but not special. There is no crowd animation – not even animated 2D sprites.+/- Decent but limited in-game announcer commentary.- No referees = no penalties.- No penalties means no challenges for incorrect plays (out of bounds, didn’t cross the down marker).- Passing mechanics. Under-throw your receiver, and he’ll turn around and wait for it. Even if the opposing defense is there and in position to intercept, the defender will rarely if ever turn around for the ball.- Not enough plays, especially on defense.- No player draft when beginning franchise mode. Stock rosters are what you start with.- Defensive plays don’t have the effect you’d expect. Blitzes apply very little pressure, meaning an extra receiver will be open – no doubt turned around and waiting for the under-thrown ball to arrive. Zone defenses are oddly effective against the run, and poor against the pass.Overall, a project with a lot of promise, but a lot of work yet to be done. If you’re a fan of American-style football, worth trying at 80% off or more.			",308,121,22,53,56,2,74

												The game features quick matchups against the AI or in coaching mode (where only plays are called); games can be customized according to weather conditions and quarter length. A simple franchise mode consists of twelve games against randomized opponents (that can repeat with no rhyme or reason). Mod support is strong, with easily editable rosters, uniforms, and logos. An improved user interface makes calling plays look and perform better. Updated graphics and improved (though still repetitive) commentary are also new this year. There are only eight plays for each formation (a slight improvement over last year’s six), but hot routes make for more flexible options. Mouse-based passing remains engaging, where a portion of the field is aimed at instead of a specific player. Kicking controls are improved and appropriately difficult. Axis Football 2016 lacks a play clock (time runs down a specific amount between plays) and does not have player fatigue, eliminating substitutions during a game. The simulation is much better this year, resulting in more plausible results. In short, Axis Football 2016 is a vast improvement over last year’s iteration.

												A game that pales in comparison to Madden, but does show enough potential to keep me interested in how this series develops. I don't regret the purchase and recommend this to anyone who prefers PC gaming ot console gaming.The passing mechanics are unique and a little annoying at first but with practice you should get better. Runnning the ball becomes much more difficult the bigger a lead you have and your O-line tends to disengage blocks sooner when you're ahead. Playing on defense is a little bland due to a lack of abilities and diversity when it comes to how players handle, and your D-lineman gnereally move too slow to sack any QB. I've had fun with this game thus far but can't imagine I'm going to invest as many hours as I have already in the first week in the future. If you want a football game on your PC and don't like EA then please support this small developer.			",15,1,0,4,2,0,0

												Ive been playing madden since, it came out on Genesis. I still own 2K5 which is still the best football game ever made. I own ps 4 and xbox one but I refuse to support madden anymore. Sixty dollars every year for a game which is still the same. The money means nothing, but the product is still behind 2k5. Where is the halftime studio, where is the score updates of other teams during the game when your in franchise mode, coin toss is gone. Where is the ability to relocate your team as in the past. Or create stadium, set prices on the merchadise for your franchise. Madden to me has gone backwards and is becoming almost a joke. Yeah the graphics are good but the overall progress of the game is just about putting out a product for money. Axis 16 has alot of work to do, but i like what they did. Its a step in the right direction and i will continue to support this product as long as i see progress to become a game that can finally give EA some competition. This is a good game. Is it the best no, not by a long shot. But its worth 20 bucks especially you can mod the roster which was brillant by the way. I want to see EA have someone to remind them of how to put quality games together.			",19,0,0,10,1,0,1

If you want to play football on a pc and can lower your expectations as far as presentation and realism are concerned, this game is for you. What Needs Work:🏈 Animations are basic and clunky🏈 No sense of inertia or impact physics (NFL2K5 is over a decade old and still feels amazing in this regard)🏈 Players on the field have slippery movement. You'll run the ball and have a hole and suddenly a defender magically slides in front of you from across the field🏈 Sound design is poor. I run an additional loop track of crowd noise in the background as well as music to beef it up and turn the less than stellar announcer down a bit.🏈 No play clock and the time mechanics in general are off. 🏈 The kicking mechanics are almost arbitrary. I have played games now where even the AI couldn't pick up the extra point after a touchdown for the entire game.So Why Play?:🏈 It's fun!🏈 Mod support🏈 I want to play football on my PC🏈 Xbox One controller works great 🏈 Despite my criticisms, I like what the developer is doing and want to see them continue to build and refineBetween the NFL mod that I DL from the mod forums and the doctoring I've done to get more robust crowd noise and music into the game, it feels reasonably close to NFL football. I only have a little over 2 hours of play time right now but even with some of the negatives, I keep coming back for more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The progress that Axis Football has made in a year is astounding!  If you are at all on the fence about purchasing, I would encourage you to look at Axis Football 2015, see the improvements made in this year's version, and buy into something that is quickly becoming the PC gamer's go-to football option. They have repeatedly responded to feedback with fixes, adjustments, and improvements.  If you read the few negative reviews so far, then look at the discussion boards, you can see that the developers are already working on a patch to add features the reviewers are requesting. And based off of their track record with community feedback, no one can doubt that those features will get put in right away.Sure, the game doesn't quite have all the bells and whistles that a 20+ year-old franchise has, but it's hard to argue with the product, support, and community presence that they've established in just a year's time!  This is a definite buy for me, and you can bet I'll have my eye on it all year long!			",0,0,0,0,1,0,1

												Update: The game plays a hundred times smoother now after not playing it for a while. It is really nice. I was really impressed how much smoother everything feels. You can play the game with a mouse and keyboard and it's so fun. The passing game is unlike anything I've ever played and the running game is reminiscent of Tecmo but better, The teams are really cool and creatively named. I have been having alot of fun playing this game and i can see myself playing it for a very long time. The only thing i was kinda looking for was the ability to pump fake when passing but after playing a couple games I feel that the game is still super fun without pump faking, You can scramble, juke effectively, and dive.

												I'll be straight. Axis Football 2016 is a good football game. It has okay graphics which makes it easy to run, the modding is great and allows a lot of customization, and above all else the game is very fun to play. The controls and aimed passing add a funn and original expirience. However, the Franchise mode is a pretty bare, and there is no coin toss, or penalties. These along with no player celebrations or in game stats take away from the overall immersion. Nevertheless it is still a good game and for $20 I highly recommend it.			",37,4,0,5,5,0,3

												What to say? It's been a long time since EA pulled Madden from the PC and finally I find a football game. It's fun to play and good. The price is nice too. The dev is engaged and changes and updates are coming which will round out the game. It's early, but it seems the game will really grow and become better. It's a little bare bones for now, but it's a great start. I like the passing to a spot via mouse, makes you think about your throws more. Was not hard to learn, if you played madden you'll be up to Hall of Fame mode quickly. It was also easy to find mods to put in other teams etc. Wish I had known about the Kickstarter for this. Keep up the great work.Developer keeps updating the game which is great, can't wait for 2017!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't want to echo what's already been said but I feel I need to keep driving that point home. As is, the game is completley playable and ultimatly a fun experience. I mean, that's pretty good when there's also no other Football game on Steam at the moment besides that dog Football. Now I am not going to ignore that there are still problems with the game, such as glitches, missing animations and so on. The thing is though, this game is going to keep getting better. Axis Games listens to the fans. More features and fixes are coming. A hear a lot of people say this game isn't that polished or there's a lot of features missing compared to other Football games and that they would rather wait for Axis Football 2017 or for those issues to be adressed. That's fine and fair to choose what you want to do with your money. However, if you are actually interested in the game, and want to see those missing features, or maybe suggest additions of your own, I highly suggest you support the game. It takes time and money to develop these things, and all the money that goes towards the purchase of this game goes towards the future development. This isn't a one time thing, this game is in it for the long run. The core gameplay is there and solid, everything else will come in time. With that said, consider your purchase an investment towards your dream Football game.			",167,30,7,16,21,2,18

												Overall, I think it's an alright game. They're not misleading us in anyway about what the game is, which is what I like. It's definitely a work in progress and at least according to reviews where people have commented that there's been a steady improvement year to year, that sounds like a good sign. It's definitely a decent football game for PC, especially since Madden withdrew from the market after 2008. It definitely needs some refinement. For the developers, I'd humbly ask that they do not add all the bloat and clunkyness that came with the Madden games over the years. I'm not sure if this game is worth $20, but if they add a lot of QoL fixes(punt return awkwardness, controls menu in options, etc), it could be. I recommend this game only if you absolutely crave a football game on PC that isn't Madden 2008. Obviously if you're someone who enjoys the new Maddens, then probably stick to those.

												As someone who plays Madden NFL and NCAA Football on console all the time, I think my expectations were set unreasonably high for this game. That being said, I think that, for the price, Axis Football 2016 probably isn't worth the money. I love having a football simulation game on my Mac that spoofs the NFL, and it's a great way to keep myself entertained for a while when I have nothing else to do, but I feel like the quality of this game—e.g. the graphics, the gameplay, the interface—is akin to that of the old NCAA Football 11 app for the iPhone, which came out in 2010...I spent $4.99 on that game. It's overly simplistic, the graphics are poor, the mechanics are both bizarre and confusing, and there aren't a ton of unique features. In a sense, it's a glorified flash game.Again, it's my fault for expecting the complexities of a $60 console game to show up in a 1.3 GB $20 computer game, so keep that in mind when factoring this review into your decision-making process. I bought it on sale, so I don't regret spending $10 on boredom therapy, but if you're looking for a solid, deeper game with your $20 bill, this probably isn't for you.Also, if you do decide to get the game, it's far better with a Steam controller, especially if you play Madden NFL or NCAA Football.

												My interest in playing football games has decreased in recent years, mainly because of the ineptitude of my favorite team, the Cleveland Browns. I no longer a hardcore football gamer, but I still enjoy playing from time to time. I was interested in an alternative to Madden that features lots of modability, so I decided to invest in Axis Football.The game still has a way to go to be comparable to even last gen football games, though it does play a reasonably fun game of football. If you're buying this game, you have to think of it as an investment in future versions where the developer is promising to bring in more features you'd expect in a current gen football game.My only concerns is that for a game that is supposed to be very mod friendly, the modding community is nearly dead. The only available mods, NFL and NCAA rosters, were released when the game came out, but there has been next to nothing since. That's definitely been the most disappointing aspect to me. Also, the amount of news on updates from the developer has seemed to dry up as well, which makes me nervous that he has already stopped supporting this version to work on next year's.I'm giving it a recommend because the bones are there for a good football game. Hopefully, a few more updates add in things like substitutions and more audio modding options and then next year we'll see a more robust game.			",5,2,0,0,2,2,0

PC Madden and Maximum Football has several stadium  models available.-Roster editing is a bit challenging, would prefered excell.Final note:Overall the game is good and playable, I'm just very picky all around. I would loved to see cheerleaders on both sidelines, It would also be cool to add press and securities.			",0,0,0,0,1,1,0

												Huge improvement from last year. Last years looked like a pre alpha honestly. This year the GUI looks more polished. A lot more polished. Presentation is everything and that's the first thing I noticed a cleaner look. That alone is awesome improvement. Next thing I noticed was the field texture. Whole lot better and more than one field type. The crowd don't look as dull as last year. Least they have life with some color. The sound quality is lot better. Way better in my opinion. The announcer is 100x better. Not as fancy as some other games but hell compared to last year I'll take it. Yes we have animations. We don't have all animations but its again better than last years 0 animations. AI is also a lot better. I actually had a close game for once. I will say consider modding the player ratings because you will find yourself with ridiculous stats in some areas. Overall gameplay mechanics are great. Don't have any issue with gameplay like how it works hope its never changes. With more animations gameplay will only get better. Franchise mode. Yes franchise mode is here. Its bare bones atm. No feature rich franchise just yet. Don't forget this is indie dev with low budget. I like it for what it offers but I do wish we could track individual stats. I haven't played much of it but I did not see a way to track individual stats when I did try it.If your itching for a American football game and don't own a console I recommend this game. Its fun and offers features that make up for the loss in other areas. The gameplay like I said is great. Gameplay makes up for short comings. We finally have a foundation at least. With more support we can build on it.			",32,1,0,2,4,1,1

												This is not Madden. I want Madden. Can't have Madden. This will have to do. Go into it with this mindset and you'll be alright. Otherwise don't buy it. Seriously no play clock? WTF. Buy this game with the hopes that they'll get enough buys to develop a real football game for steam/pc. This is essentially Tecmo Bowl with advanced timed passing and better graphics. Lead blockers do not pick up blocks. Defense is essentially 4-3 / base man and guard the slot receiver. Offense is toss to rb and run to the outside or short passes past the d line. 40-15 scores all day. This game is limited in features. I really want to like this game. But it's a tough pill to swallow. Weird glitches. Like holding right on kick offs and their return runner runs OB. When you get the ball off a turn over, don't press any buttons to pick a defense player and just hold left stick down. Interception.			",85,15,4,4,29,4,26

												Sorry axis, I REALLY tried to like this game, but I just couldn't, the gameplay is bad... just bad, the recievers RARELY catch a pass, even when they're wide open. The only way to even win, is to just keep running the ball. The game is also lacking a tutorial for playing defense. Why even put out a football game with no depth chart, FA, or even stat keeping. For the price its at, its SEVERELY lacking, I would pay $5 for this at the very most. I really hope they put out patches to fix a lot of it, maybe then I'll give it a re-purchase.The only pro I can think of is, it is reminiscent of the old days of football where, they leather helmets, and ran the ball 90% of the time.

												I like the concept of the game.  I like that it's completely moddable.  But I think that what is missing isn't 'animations' and cheerleaders, and hot routes.  It's stats!  Statistics are valuable and imperative for any sports game.  I haven't played the game much.  I only tried it out.  But I tried to do some modding for a while.  I couldn't find a place to manipulate the roster!  Am I missing something?  No depth chart?   No player season stats?  If I'm overlooking something let me know.  And what's that big mess of a franchise home screen?  It's every team listed with their records.  Where are the divisions?  The conferences?   Those are the aspects that make a sports game (especially football) seem like a league.  Chasing records, winning championships, and drafting.  That's football.  Gotta quit thinking about how can I make this look good, and start thinking, how can I make people fall in love with their players and their team?  Give them control.  That's how!  I recommend the game, because at this point, I recommend anything that isn't Maddens and can be played on the PC.  But I'll stick to Front Page Sports original '95 and '98.			",52,15,0,22,31,0,14

												First, if you are expecting a Madden-based expirence, you are only going to get a very basic outline. The game is a good start, and upcoming games in the series seem promising. You need to play a few minutes of a game to get used to the goofy gameplay, but after that, the game is quite fun. I am looking forward to more games in this series to come out.			",22,2,2,2,14,0,1

												Just played my first game, loved it!  The developer has made huge progress since the 2015 version.  The AI is a lot more advanced than the previous version, the animations also look a lot better.  If you are looking for a fun football game for PC, then you have found it.  Keep in mind that this is a small team of developers, you won't see all the features that madden has to offer, but it is refreshing finally having a good football game on PC.  Another great thing is that the developer actually listens to feedback about things that need to be fixed or new features that would be nice.  Looking forward to seeing how this game progresses!

												The Axis Football series is something football gamers have needed for a long time, and the possibilities are endless.The passing mechanic alone makes this game addicting. There's nothing quite like putting the ball exactly where you want it to try and lead your receiver for 6. The mod control is very good, and it is only going to get deeper and deeper as time goes by. The real hero for the game is the developer, Danny Jugan. He LISTENS to the community and adds their requests into updates (mine made it into v2.0) . He truly wants the best football game for this community, and unfortunately we don't get that elsewhere *cough cough*Yes as of right now there is not much in the game, but if you look at the leaps from Axis 15 to Axis 16, one could understand why most are excited for this game's future.Purchase this game to have fun with the franchise mode, quick play, coach mode, or even just to make every classic team you can. Most importantly, remember with every purchase of Axis, all the the funds go towards making the game the best it can be. I for one can't wait for the future of Axis			",26,3,1,2,3,1,0

												I played the Flash version of this game for dozens of hours. I was really expecting to love this.But it just... isn't fun. It doesn't have the same charm as the flash version. It plays identical as the over-head view yet tries to hamfist those mechanics into 3rd person and the result is terrible. You can forgive a lack of jukes/sprinting/etc when it's overhead, but when it goes third person like this, it just looks and feels terrible. There's practically nothing to do on defense but watch. Whereas the flash game was unique, this is literally a worse Madden. You would be better off downloading Madden 2008 and playing that. Real shame, I love the flash game but this just feels *nothing* like it unfortunately.If the game was 5$, I could see keeping this. But at nearly $20, I requested a refund.			",204,20,0,47,19,1,27

												It still should be early access. the game has a long way to go. I've never seen a defender break the line or even a blitz get to the quarterback. everything  feels like the runners are in slots that are inescapeable.			",49,14,20,4,43,5,3

												Do not expect this ti look or play like Madden but this is definitely the foundation to a rival in the making.Cons:  Light on animations for receiver/conerback interactions and all other interactions           No depth charts as of yet           Playbook is lightPros:  Good foundation to start the process of rivaling Madden          Passing pehanic is a reath of fresh airI reccomend Hall of Fame mode if you desire a challenge ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not a bad game. There are a few bugs like when you recieve the ball and you are holding the down button it runs backwards for half a second. It would be nice if you could see the controls while in game. There's a lot to be improved but I enjoyed playing.			",3,0,0,1,1,0,0

												I have only played the game for a little over an hour but I'm really enjoying it.  The game is nothing compared to Madden by no means but it is a nice alternative and good to see a football game back on the computer.  If everyone will support this game and  help the developers out this might turn into a really awesome football game down the road.  I never played the 2015 version but found this one on steam and I'm really enjoying the game a lot.			",145,62,14,32,32,0,11

												Wow! A Football game that I can run on my Rig. Dude, this is just awesome!  Im glad I bought this game because I really enjoy it.  All the hard work and time that has been put into this game has paid off.  I don't own an xbox or ps4.  My gaming is done on my PC.  Aftermarket Controller works just fine with Axis.  Can't wait for 2017 to be released.  But in the mean time 2016 runs like a Super Bowl Champion!  The NFL Mod loads very nicely.  Even a novice could Delete, Copy and paste the NFL rosters in to the Mod Folder...  You can also add any music you want to the Menu by dropping a .wav or .ogg file right into the folder.  Not to mention you could even add your own play by play calling voice (I actually bought myself a nice mic for recording to do it)!!! Add to all that, you can edit the stadiums if you have a program like Corel Draw X7.  I totally redid the Billboard with NFL, NFC and AFC Logo's. HAHAHA!! Thank you! Thank you guys! Keep up the awesome work guys!!!!			",15,7,4,2,9,1,8
