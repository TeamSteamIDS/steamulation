Early Access Review
								Have you played Punch-Out in the past? This game is Punch-Out in VR!My first impression after having played through the tutorial, beat the 1st and 2nd enemy, and failed against the third enemy twice: fantastic game, achieves what it wants to do (Punch-Out in VR), highly polished visuals, very active combat.If you expect to get a realistic boxing game, then this isn't for you (there is an octopus as an enemy...an octopus!). But if you enjoy a pattern-recognition based arcade boxing game that requires you to pay attention, be quick on your feet/block reactively, then this game is for you!If you want a semi-realistic boxing game, then Thrill of The Fight may be a better game for you (can't recommend Kunlun Fighting, is significantly worse than Thrill of the Fight). This game and Thrill of the Fight stand in two separate game genre's even if they superficially seem to belong to the ""boxing"" genre.Knockout League allows you to dodge, however, you also have to counter quickly to get a hit in. The game doesn't require much space as it wants you to dodge sideways rather than backwards.You can also block enemies' attacks by timing it. If you block too early, you won't be allowed to counter back. This makes the game a lot more exciting!Currently the game's difficulty level is ramping up quickly and it is unlikely that you will be able to beat all enemies in one go. This is actually a good thing and you'll notice that with repeated matches that you simply get better and better to read the enemies' actions beforehand and overcoming such a challenge is always satisfying.There are still a few minor bugs I've encountered that are already mentioned in the early access page above.I can recommend this game to anyone that liked Punch-Out, likes more active VR games and people enjoying challenging fights.(This review will be edited after playing more of the game and if content patches change up the game significantly in the future)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Tried it for a few minutes.  Went through the training, then got knocked out after a minute or so with the first fighter.Very good graphics, feels like a VR first person version of Street Fighter or something.  I really wish it was possible to set the starting position in each fight, the default one fits my playspace very poorly and makes the game hard to play.			",139,40,10,6,41,4,4

								Just fired it up for some training and a few rounds.First impression:  Already the most polished and fun boxing experience in VR.  Just as much exercise and immersion as Thrill of the Fight, but it feels like a full-on game with training area, some character customization, fleshed-out environments, etc.Also:  be ready for a workout like with Thrill of the Fight.  You'll be ducking, dodging and dancing even on the first fight.			",45,16,1,0,6,2,1

								I was pretty excited for this game but it was a big letdown. The game does not deliever what it promises. First, it is not room scale. You can not move around-- only duck. So why would it need room scale?  Next, they promise 1:1 punching movements. Yes, it tracks your gloves nicely, but you aren't able to freely attack. You have to wait for pre-determined moves which repeat over and over then punch. The game would be more fun and has better replayability if it was more random and fluid. Pass.			",23,6,2,0,9,1,0

								I just noticed a fair amount of negative reviews which I find very shocking.  This is one of the best made games on the Vive.  Granted I can't get past the second fighter but it is so much fun!  I don't know what people expected.  If you loved Punch Out on the NES then you will love this game!  If you are looking for a boxing sim then look elsewhere.  But the gameplay is exactly as intended.  This is Punch Out in VR.  That is all you have to know.			",45,15,2,5,17,4,0

								Pros: - Punching is on point! - Blocking is on point! - Dodging is on point! - Opponents are really awesome! - Art style is great! - Excellent workout! - Amazingly optimized!Cons:                      - Boundaries can be a nuisance (devs fixed within 24 hours!!!) - Missing some content shown in the trailer (training mini games) - Only 4 fights so farOverall for an early access game this is a must experience. Dont expect this to give you too much playtime just yet. But what is here is definitely worth the experience. As i said this will now be one of my go to games for demoing my Vive to new people. Also cant stress how polished this feels. I played with supersampling up to 1.5 and i felt i could push it even further!			",216,28,5,29,25,4,14

								Edited Due to update fixing everything.You can set how far forward or back you are now. My only reccomendation is maybe putting a little cicle or ghost of where your opponent will be when you are setting this. Otheriwse this was the exact fix I was looking for and honestly a lot of games, (Fruit Ninja for example) could use a similar option. Great work by the devs!FYI, I am working with the smallest allowed room space by Steam VR and I have plenty of space in front and behind me.Characters look great and solid, great sense of depth, runs well, functions as it says it does, with a minor bug here and there they already seem to be patching out.I have seen people complain that there are only 4 fights. Which is understandable. But the game is only $20, which by VR prices is low. Fucntionally it works. And, after just one fight, its exhausting. You do a lot of ducking, leaning, punching, and fights are longer than I expected. Honestly, 4 fights for me is okay, but maybe put in a hard mode where it takes 2x as long. I think I could be satisfied with that.I reccomended it before they patched it, and now it will be definitely be a game I will demo for friends trying VR. Its simple, functional, and fun.

								I had a lot of fun with the 2 first fights, the blocking system of this game is excellent, the problem is that when you know how to beat an oponnent you will never lose as they always do the same attacks so after follow the sequence correctly you win, I guess that it will not be a problem when the game is complete with enough fighters, so I'm not giving a bad review for that.My review is due to the awfull dodge system, to dodge you have to go to a determinate direction, each enemy can attack from 5 directions and you can dodge to 5 directions, the game track your movement not your position so if you go to the correct side it will count as a dodge even if you get hit in game, but if you go to the wrong side it counts as a hit even if you are miles away fro the enemie punch. You cannot block the 3rd fighter and for me is almost impossible know how to dodge him, sometimes I get hit and sometimes I don't, I try to go to the logic side when I see him coming but I still get hit, I tried to beat him for 1 hour and end up frustrated because there is no way to use the logic when someone is spaming hits and you cannot dodge any of them,  you don't know if it is because you are going to the wrong side or you are doing a bad timing. I just give up and will return the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Just like many of the other reviewers said. This game is like Punch-out but in VR.  I was able to beat the first 2 opponents and went 1 round with the 3rd opponent. I am so freaking sore now. This game is a great workout. It doesn't make you walk around in roomscale but expects you to stay in a certain place and dodging left and right and/or ducking. The little details are what makes this game amazing. Like when you get hit, your vision gets fuzzy but only a couple of seconds, or when you are about to go down the color fades away. The second opponent taunts you while you are down as if you are sorta hallucinating. So much FUN! The characters all have a certain personality and you can get a glimpse of it in their trailer.Even with 4 opponents, this game is worth more than the price tag. I hope to see this getting expanded. Such a perfect game to see in VR. Wish i could play more tonight but sadly, i'm just too sore.			",84,17,2,10,7,2,0

								As soon as I saw the mystic jaguar warrior princess I knew this was the boxing game I had been waiting for. You've been playing Thrill of the Fight, it's ok, there was that zombie fight. But now you're ready for a beautiful game that requires skill and stamina. It's time for Knockout League. This game's polish makes it a jewel among the current VR desert. Interesting fight patterns, great enemy tells, cool characters, slick audio. If you've read this much of my review you're interested enough to buy it. You've already made up your mind.

								Fun VR successor to the old nes game punchout.The game is not really about learning to box, or even learning to free fight, its more about learning the patterns of your opponents, and dodging and/or blocking accordingly, to get them into a stun where you need to punch them as much as you can.The graphics are very nice, cartoonish, and comic like. The soundtrack is typical Rocky inspired.Its not really what I expected though, and abit more free fight would have been nice. The dodging also requires ALOT OF MOVEMENT, making dodging very difficult. More difficult than in real life.Still I do recomend this game för kinds and ppl who like to practice both mind and body at the same time. You need to move alot!			",42,4,1,4,10,3,6

								Ok..  This is like Punch Out, but you're in the game.  I know it's early access and it's only 4 fighters, but the game is a lot of fun.  Even when you know what it takes to beat a guy it can still feel exahusting.  After playing a few rounds you get pretty tiered.  While we have only beat the first 2 fighters it makes us hungry for more.  We are working on it, but it's tough enough that it's fun.It's easy to make a mistake and if you miss that dodge, you can be done for.  We absolutely love the game, and we think you will too if you are a fan of the old Punch Out games.			",91,24,4,4,23,9,1

								The game is in a strange state, it is very fun, but that fun is only temporary. It will keep you busy for a few days, until you beat the 4 (widely varied and interesting characters) by learning their specific moves, unfortunely, then the game falls flat on its face. This game has no replay value. Like at all. In its current state there is no unlockables, and the 4 enemies take about 2-4 hours to learn and beat. After that theres nothing else to do. For 20 dollars, id wait until they announce unlockables or other characters before buying.			",28,6,0,1,1,1,1

								It's fun, but the video is misleading. There are no training mini games involving bags. They're grayed out. The only training is mit work with the trainer. The game is pretty hard. I couldn't beat the second boxer, a woman, during my first 30 min. You can't fight the next two boxers until you beat her. There are four total. I don't recall seeing a life bar. It seemed like you had to hit the opponent perfectly in a set sequence to knock him/her down. I prefer a life bar that you can whittle down over time. Assuming this gets more content, it's worth it.Update: I've played this for 1.2 hours and have beaten all four boxers and done the training twice. 1st boxer: Beat twice on first attempt (update lost my save, so fought him again)2nd boxer: Took 3 attempts to beat3rd boxer: Took 3 attempts to beat (watched a guy beat him, then beat him myself)4th boxer: Took 1 attempt to beat			",287,63,7,6,29,4,7

								This game can be in the future as one of the best VR games, nice cartoon graphics and visuals in general, carismatic oponents, nice music, you feel like you are in a dangerous and funny boxing combat, but it has very critical issues, like you must stay still on one point of your play area even if you have set up room scale you should stay on that spot the whole time and the spot is on the back edge of your chaperone, in my case I have a wardrobe few centimeters far from the chaperone limit. The other issue is that the oponents are doing constantly the same moves and the worse is that when you know all the oponent attacks, you can get the dodge position seconds before the oponent does the attack, it make you feel very silly keeping your body bended until your oponent finish its attack. At the moment I not recomend this game, it needs so much improvements to be just good.			",57,19,2,4,15,5,2

								I want to start by saying the art in this game is excellent. The characters are interesting and fun to watch and the animations make it fell like Mike Tyson's Punch Out VR.Unfortunately it doesn't feel like this game takes advantage of touch controls. Boxing feels more like button mashing through arm flailing than anything else. Dodging is more about making the correct ducking motion than instinctually getting out of the way of in incoming swing.I see what the devs were going for, and I have hopes that this game will get there. In its current state however, I find it more exhausting than fun.			",69,7,5,10,5,2,11

								I feel very sorry for not recommending this game at its current state.Honestly, the game is really fun, and is definitly a great workout, the only game actually that makes me shower right after playing it. Graphics are good, and the characters are entertaining. However, ther are things that are really frustrating with this game that I have decided to abandon it at the moment. The tracking is good enough, but it is as if the game is designed to allow you to hit the opponent only at specific moments, which totally changes your perception of the game, and changes fun into frustration. You see your gloves hitting the character's ungarded body parts, yet nothing happens, and the game only allows you to hit at specific time points, otherwize you waste your energy and build up sweat, much like punching thin air!

YouTube™ Video: NEVER AGAIN.. KNOCKOUT LEAGUE FIRST TIME GAMEPLAY! | HTC VIVE 

			Views: 224		

			Knockout league is a virtual reality boxing game where you defeat your opponents by figuring out their rhythm patterns in order to land hits.		

I was really excited for this game to come out. When it did I kept hearing a bunch of mixed things. My first impression of the game was great; the first fight was super fun and i was excited for the next one. After that it was just exhausting for me and it's when I came to the realization that this game is rhthym/pattern based. You can't land any hits unless its during a certain part of the pattern they run where they are vulnerable. I'd choose Thrill of the Fight over this one.			",202,22,4,16,41,3,31

								This may be a well polished game but is not as dynamic as advertised... when you have a opening you should be able to hit the opponent but this is only true for the predefined ""time slot"" and if you miss this window you cant ""hurt"" them ... if this game was more dynamic (like fist of physics) i would highly recomend it Pros:High quality charactersGreat GraphicsWell optimised preformancecons:fighting system is ""on rails"" hit detection is spotty at times""blocking"" is not accurate because it can time out in short to make this game more enjoyable it needs to allow for more brawling and each character needs a more dynamic fighting style and blocking should not ever ""time out"" instead the character you  are fighting should change tactics to counter the blocking with different attacks .. i reccomend it if you like games like the WWE smackdown games as this is practically the VR equivilent			",251,42,32,13,37,5,5

								This game is very polished, has nice graphics, and will give you a good workout. I was sweating a lot from the 2nd opponent. Some negatives... - Game starts off with you wearing gloves in opposite hands. Nothing major but it's annoying having to remove wrist straps just to swap controllers.- Pricey for a short game with only 4 opponents, but it's in early access so more to come.- Can't change graphic settings until after tutorial and it starts on the lowest settings.- During tutorial if you hit your trainer he gets upset and repeats his lines from the beginning.Overall a fun game but not worth the asking price. Yet...			",83,35,9,7,39,8,1

								Got this refunded after a couple of goes. Beyond the surface, which is decent, the game itself is really dull. The problem; the opponents follow a set pattern, and it's not varied, it's a short sequence where they build up to their attack, you then dodge or block and only then can you hit back. You throw a few punches and you repeat the process.It's not dynamic, you oberserve this obvious sequence and keep repeating until you win. This gets repetive quickly. Fine for the first hour, but hardly offering much longevity. Sure it's early access but you can see this is the mechanic they're going for here, where good graphics paper over a rather bland experience.Worth it for a fiver at best.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								ok, so this is a literal VR version of punch-out. except punch-out was fun.here's how it works thus far: you stand in the center of the ring. if you move your head with the proper level of intensity, which isn't really well explained, you will trigger a dodge. the dodge is apparently invisible, so you can't tell if you triggered it too early, too late, or not at all. while your punches are 1:1, the animations are not - you can get punched even if the punch animation is nowhere near your head. this becomes obvious if you try to step out of the way instead of move your head.if you're imagining moving around the ring and really using that room-scale, you can't. your opponent will stubbornly stand in the center of the ring and stare at the circle you are supposed to be in. it's kind of like boxing a gif. he won't follow you like an actual boxer, he won't try to guide you back to the middle of your play space (but you will get a helpful error demanding you return to the fight if you move too far away). he will just stand there and throw punches at the location you're supposed to be in, and you will have to ""dodge"" them. you have to try very hard to not shatter the illusion that you're in a ring.while i get that there's some safety aspect here, i think this ended up being the worst of all worlds. i can't recommend this game unless they seriously re-think the gameplay, because right now i feel like the nes version of this is more immersive (and fun).

								An arcade style punch game, very polished but also feels extremely limited. Don't recommend unless you really enjoy turn based fight system with no room scale movement. I have a strong feeling that I can play this game with keyboard or xbox controller without much difference. The graphics is very polished, maybe the most polished as a vr combat game, but there are so many polished non-vr games out there and this game don't have the vr only contents that worth putting on the headset. This game looks like a PSVR game rather than vive game, although it is supported by ' vive studio'.Hope I can turn this to a big thumb up after some big update one day.			",135,36,9,21,32,5,15

								Just get Thrill of the Fight.  This is a boxing game where you can't punch your opponents.  Yes, that's right, you can *only* counter them!  Also, the game is not room scale.  You are required to stay in a specific area of the ring and wait for them to come to you.  If you exceed their boundary limits, the game will halt.For a game that advertises ""1:1 punch movement that lets you attack how you want."", that's a total load of baloney.  They will block every jab you take at them.Basically, you must read their super-slow telegraphed attack, remember what you're required to do (dodge, punch, or block) and then swat at them quickly and aimlessly like a catfight.  Forget about perfectly executed hooks, uppercuts, overhead smashes, body blows, etc.There's also something weird about the game: There are only four opponents, and the coach and first two weakest opponents are all black: an old black coach, a huge dumb Mike Tyson-like boxer and a black ""jungle woman"".  Wouldn't it be weird if the first three characters you encountered in a game were all Slavic, or Latino, or Asian, or [fill in a random race here]?  It would be different if the remaining two boxers were of somewhat proportional balance, but instead we have a white pirate and a octopus.  So we have three black people, a white pirate, and an octopus to punch at.  It struck me as a bit weird, like a stereotype of who participates in boxing.  I'll let you come to your own conclusions.If you want an uninteresting reaction game, this is your game.  If you want a boxing game, get Thrill of the Fight.  I had such high hopes for this, but it's a child's game pretending to be about boxing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Great graphics, but that is about it.  This is more a pattern recognition game than it is a boxing game.  Can't box or hit until they begin a static action/ The game does not deliever what it promises. First, it is not room scale. You can not move around-- only duck. So why would it need room scale? You have to wait for pre-determined moves which repeat over and over then punch. The game would be more fun and has better replayability if it was more random and fluid.   Could be great if it was more like boxing game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Very Frustrating Game, NEEDS in game Tut -on blocking. I can't figure out how to PROPERLY Block, so i always get hit. NOT A FUN GAME.  REFUND until they update the game with a LOGIAL TUTORIAL SESSION.Pros: Great Graphics, AudioCons: Controls/Gameplay are very confusing, (i've played 100+ VR games) making the user feel lost and not enjoyable at ALL. Much better boxing games than this 1.			",35,21,2,3,20,3,1

								I don't make reviews often, if at all. This game is amazing. If you grew up playing Punch Out and loved the Wii version, you will love Knockout League.This is a very similar game in that it's got stylized characters that have patterns of attacks you have to figure out via punching, dodging and blocking. I really wish you could dodge backwards for certain punches.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I have quite a few games in my collection and I am always on the lookout for something a bit different and that has potential. Reading that this game is from an HTC owned devloper I thought it should be good, an it is!I am not a sports or boxing fan, and am rubbish at any kind of sports in real life, but this game doesnt need any interest or  commitment to this or any sport, just an enthusiasm to enjoy knocking seven bells out of an opponent and dodge.It's an awesome feeling to knock an opponent out. The abilty to hit as hard as you want without hurting anyone and making yourself fitter makes this a must buy if you want to use your Vive to shed a few pounds.I love this game and am lookng forward to its completion. True boxing afficianados may not love it, as its not a serious boxing simulator (you can fight an octopus!), but most people who choose to actually buy should not be disappointed. Steam will refund you if you really dont like it anyway, so whats there to lose.			",116,55,9,1,41,6,4

								A+ For Presentation. If Nintendo were producing VR Punch-Out I couldn't imagine it looking far different from this.Unfountately I think the Hit Detection is way unfinished. It's just annoying for the game to claim I've been punched when I was ducking. I don't know maybe I'm supposed to dodge RIGHT before the opponent is punching but still when the game says I've been hit I want a Fist flying into my face.Maybe it's a height problem or something but until then I have to say BUY THIS GAME WITH CAUTION. For now Thrill of the Fight remains my favorite boxing game for the simple reason that it feels right.I'm going to hold onto my purchase and hope the devs work on this, but I hope this game feels far better when released.
