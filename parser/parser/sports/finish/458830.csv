								Snooker Nation improves a little on the snooker mode in Pool Nation FX, but it's buggy, has few modes, and despite the crowd clapping and the referee counting score, it feels... soulless.What bothers me most, and is the reason for the thumbs down, is that Snooker Nation has been sidelined while the devs work on Pool Nation VR, which they released just one month after this one. There hasn't been any development on SN since then.			",85,29,8,11,20,1,9

								Abandoned Early Access.  Cherry Pop's form for releasing Early Access games then quickly upgrading them to full broken releases mean that I cannot recommend buying.I will change this review should the situation change.Add censoring the forums whilst ignoring other threads asking for help to the reasons why you should not bother with this company._________Still no updates for 11 months.

Early Access Review
								Let me start by saying that the game is quite good. However, due to the lack of updates for more than 10 months, I cannot really recommend it.This game has the potential to be the best snooker simulation, but has been neglected by the developer, so it remains lacking in several aspects, despite the promising start when it received two updates in the first couple of weeks after it was released as Early Access. Perhaps most importantly, the cushions don't react too realistically as the balls lose too much momentum when they hit a cushion. Other than that, there are some bugs in the rules, as well as some more general issues, while the camera options are lacking. The core gameplay might be good, but without the polish needed in those and perhaps some other areas, the game feels incomplete and not fully satisfying.If you want a good snooker game, you can still get it, but if you want a great snooker game, there are no guarantees that it would ever reach that level, despite the obvious potential. Should the situation change, I will revise my review, but until a substantial update that fixes the main issues is released, I cannot recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Basically they seem to have ripped out a portion of a different game (Pool Nation FX) and resold it on steam as an 'early access' title. They then release Pool Nation VR just 5 weeks later and i dont think there has been any update or word from the devs since regarding this game.Just take a look in the forums and you will see not only are there no updates, but there is no reply at all from the devs. They are active in the Pool Nation FX and Pool Nation VR forums, but utterly silent on the Snooker Nation Championship forums.I know it is inexpensive, but i wouldnt even pay the £3 they are asking for it. Devs like this deserve no money and no support.From the store page:Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?“We're hoping to be in early access for no longer than a year. We will follow the communities lead on when we feel its ready for a full release”11 months so far and not even a single update yet... not one.How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?“We want to schedule set updates, that we can work together towards. Each update will be planned in advance and we will take it one update at a time based on community feedback :)”Sure.... This is an outright lie. Cherry Pop Games are scam artists, plain and simple. AVOID.			",158,57,4,12,28,2,37

								I cannot recommend buying into this game as it currently stands in its unfinished form. Here's why...I bought Pool Nation FX in its early stages of development because of the addition of a ""Snooker"" game. The developers (Cherry Pop Games) were very keen to turn this into a serious, well-made snooker game and progress was originally good with lots of support from people wanting a great snooker game. CPG decided to take all the suggestions from the PC players and put them into a ""new"" paid-for version of the game called ""Snooker Nation Championship"" which I bought into with hope and excitement. The graphics were great but the old bugs, issues and problems from PNFX were still present along with some new seriously bad sound issues __ so basically a cut and paste job from PNFX to SNC.However since promises of updates the develpment of this game has stalled completely with no feedback from CPG leaving the game unfinished and unplayable.In the meantime CPG have realeased a new virtual pool game, which seems to be successful and are working on a virtual hockey game now too. To add insult to injury they have relased an ""update"" of SNC on the X-box while we, the PC punters are still waiting...So for many months now I have bought into a belief that this snooker game is going to be great while all along playing a half-hearted botched, unenjoyable, bugged game with no real improvent on the PC to date.Cherry Pop Games, to date, simply cannot be trusted.

I like the authentic feel of the snookertables, the cues, the different area's you can play in, etc.It's Early Access which means I experienced some fatal errors and I think there's still something wrong with the achievements but I am confident it will be fixed ASAP.The game is really worth the price.

								Ok.. So I think this is the first review I have ever writen on Steam but this game... I simply can't just sit here and watch people spend there hard earnd money(Even though price is not much, but this game is not even worth it as free to play) on this pile of **** from **** devs. Not only is the game FAR from unfinished, bugd, single player has the worst AI ever if you can do a break of 20 or higher you will easely beat the HARDEST AI that barely get a break on 10. But no, that is not enough, on top of that it's getting close to 1year since update to the game, like 4-5months since heard from the devs.So people, just don't buy this game, not even if you think it looks ok as it is and it's cheap. Just dont support devs like this, devs like this is what ruins entire Early Access so just don't support them even if they drop price to 0.001euro. And also Valve, you should show that you cares about your customers and accept refund for this game form everyone and atleast remove it from Steam store.			",24,2,12,4,10,0,2

								Game had the potential to be good.The problem is Cherry Pop - a company with a history of lies, broken promises and deceipt.The pattern they follow is :1. Release a game based on a previous game that therefore inherits all the previous issues.2. Release a couple of patches quickly that fix next to nothing but more importantly promise the earth and announce to every corner of the internet of the wonderful plans for the future.3. Do nothing more but secretly work on the next game.4. Start apologising for the delays with the excuse that Cherry Pop are a small team, and ban people from the forums that complain.5. Go back to step 1.Honestly - Cherry Pop are crooks plain and simple.They are the sort of people that rob old ladies or steal money from blind homeless people. I sincerely hope they go out of business and never work again. They are shameless lying bullies and the scum of game development. Total failures that never finish anything and treat their paying customers with all the respect of dogs dirt.Avoid this company and any game they put out like a plague.0/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Same old same old game. Reskined. Different atmosphere. Copy/paste pure and simple. This is Cherry Pop in all it's glory. The game was gifted to me by a friend and I feel sorry for writing this only because this friend wanted to play snooker (remember that barely no one plays online just like PNFX) and probably thought I would enjoy this unfinished pile but I can't recommend this game to anyone for a simple reason. It's Cherry Pop who's behind this game. Developped while PNFX was still in early access and abandonned 1 month after. So. They launched 2 pool game on Steam in a few months both on EA and both left to dry. And their favorite word is SOON and it's clear that this game is not even in their plans anymore.To conclude, stay away from anything that has the name Cherry Pop slapped on it. It's a sure sign that whatever they develop, it will turn into a ghost 1 or 2 months after being released. No one plays the game anymore for a reason. No more update, devs who don't listen, game is full of annoying bugs...bugs I won't enumerate because it is futile. I once made the mistake of starting a thread about what was wrong with PNFX and after 6 months not even one update came to fix anything. Cherry Pop should be fined and denied any more chance to make one more video game. They are just a bunch of exploiting thieves looking for quick money so they can Tweet about them eating ice cream and saying ""Ice cream in the sun thanks #topeleven #nordeus #developconf #lovinglife""Absolutely mind boggling that they can get away with robbery.

								I don't particularly like Snooker, I don't follow it and I think I have played it (for real) maybe twice in my 33 year life time, but I've played the odd sim, and I must say, even at its ""early access"" state, this is one of the best I have ever seen.Gorgeous looks and sounds, already filled with decent single player, local and online multiplayer modes. Physics seem good to me, coming from a casual stance on the sport, and I think that even hardened sim Snooker....um... ists will enjoy the challenge that the harder AI offers. And yes, I am getting trounced on Easy, thanks for asking! =DNot really sure what else you would want from a Snooker sim... maybe some unlocks? All I see currently are extra venues, which is decent, but not really sure where they could go with that. Extra game modes? Fantasy venues? I think this is more of a ""I want to play Snooker 'cos I want to play Snooker"" kind of game, not a ""I want to play Snooker to be rich and famous and have lots of sponsorship deals"" etc. Just pure Snooker.Anyone with even the slightest inkling of interest in the sport, just get it, you won't be sorry. Going to look into their Pool title, if it is on par with this, that too will be well worth a buy. Signed, a non-Snooker fan.			",268,37,36,22,61,4,31

								needs a bit of work. Its early access so still in terms of game play rough.. cushions tend to have an odd bounce to them most of the time... some of the angles when hitting the balls seem out.. get rediculous bounces out the pockets even at medium pacedont know if the sounds of the balls 'clicking' together disappear but seems an awful lot of push shots with no soundstill havent figured out how to add bottom/spin to the ball.. I hope its not moving the mouse back and forwards quickly.. When tight to the cushion the view is obscured by the 'transparent' cue which gets annoying.. AI is wierd.. standard difficulty and they are playing cannons at some very strange angles into the middle pockets!It would be good if the AI aim was actually where the ball was going (they can be aiming straight yet the ball comes off at an angle). Graphics are excellent. would prefer to have the keyboard configured to move the camera up and down the table rather than having to push the mouse..most annonying things in the game... mostly sounds are a let down.the floppy people in the snooker hall.. what on earth are they doing?the referee constantly shouting for mobile phones to be turned off or to be quiet and let the players concentrate.. even though no mobile has gone off and there is no noise coming from the crowd... the way they cut off the clapping and oohs and aaahs.. it just stops deadthe referee echo no matter whether you are in a hall /club or Championship table.. its like playing in an empty cave..

								Probably the best snooker game so far. Despite the Early Access, it's quite playable. The only thing I don't like - shadows. They need to improve it. Hope they will.			",254,51,18,25,19,9,25

								The game looks stunning overall. The Unreal Engine really has made this really lifelike. However, I struggled to play a friendly match with my friend and we both had fatal errors - mine leading to restarting the PC. The way the game plays, the controls and the physics are second to none, way better than the competitor titles on Steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								You can tell this game is still in early access. A fair few things need polishing, like the referee's voice etc. But the referee calling out to crowd to be quiet is a nice touch, even when the crowd makes no real audible noise at all...The main area that you immediately notice needs attention is the audio. But, as stated, the game is in EA so that's perfectly understandable.As for the mechanics, the game takes probably about half an hour to get the hang of. If you already know the rules of snooker very well and watch the sport regularly it will be even quicker probably. The design of the game is good and the graphics quality are great. The controls are actually really well thought out, and the user interface is handy - particularly the aim assist, which goes red if you're aiming at a ball which isn't on, for example. Definitely a game to unwind to with a beer after work, or something light hearted to play if you're a bit stressed out.It's surprisingly addictive, and rewarding. When you get that tricky shot on the cushion just right, and the side on the cue ball perfect, the ball pots, the white comes away from the cushion perfect for the black - it's just satisfying for any snooker fan. If you don't know snooker very well, but enjoy playing other table sports, you may also find this game really interesting. Definitely well worth the few pounds paid for.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game is awsome! Beautiful graphics good shooting system. Awsome replays. I played WSC couple of hours before and this game might be better than WSC. And this game is only early acces this time so it will be better and better. Good job and hope it will be more better and better. Recommended!!!			",808,319,48,103,124,23,172

								Really great snooker game, nice graphics and the 'feel' of the shot system is fantastic, It works fantastically with an xbox gamepad. It would be nice to have a little more interaction with the other player..I don't want to talk to them but some sort of table tap feature to acknowledge a good shot by the other player would be nice. This is the best snooker game since WSC on the xbox 360. Highly recommend this one.			",12,3,4,0,8,0,0

								Best Snooker game I've ever played. The game is really polished, especially for Early Access. Graphics are really nice and crisp. Lots of different game modes to choose from (was surprised to find there is also two player versus and multiplayer! However the Sound effects are lacking in quality, especially when the balls kiss each other, decent sound effects are lacking. And what's up with that overly loud referee with no option in audio settings to turn his voice down? lolAI could use some tweaks and the handling of the cue can prove to be tricky sometimes using a Mouse, in particular the power-up of your shots.But overall a great game worth its great price.

								A decent game with a few flaws. It would be nice if after taking a shot the camera would follow the object ball to show if it's gone in the pocket or not and if not by how much it has missed by. Also using either the mouse or the x box controller i find aiming can be tricky.  You try and fine tune your aim only to find that some times the cue just shoots of in a totally different direction. For an early access game though it shows great potential and unlike some other early access games is priced sensibly. If you are a snooker fan or just want to play something different I would recommend it			",103,48,3,40,39,3,56

								Early access - but very promising and nice to see the devs quite engaged and eager to listen to the community as they iron out and refine the game.Some occasional whachy physics (which the devs voiced refining) and some sound and bug fixing required - but a very enjoyable and thoroughly playable game in this early stage.F2P would be a mistake in my opinion and the price with or without loyalty discount is very well worth it.

								For this price this game is a steal. Realistic physics, which reminded me a bit of Cue Club, pretty graphics and working multiplayer. For Early Access pool game that is a quite a start. Personally I don't like Pool Nation from Cherry Pop, but this one is pure joy to play. Highly recommended, especially for snooker fans!UPD: the game didn't receive any updates for a loooong period of time whatsoever. Seems like developers are too busy to support early access stage of this potentially brilliant game. From now on I can't recommend			",218,12,13,18,8,1,4

+ The gameplay is excellent, you can hit the ball anywhere you like, make angle shots, jump shots, adjust your power shots, there's helpful indicators that show you where each ball may end up, and even an overview camera.+ Visually pleasing, made in the Unreal Engine so of course the lighting and detail looks fantastic+ A really amazing game for people who enjoy Snooker, Pool, or are beginners and trying to learn the basics like me+ A zoom-in / slow-motion camera that adds excitement to close shots (also looks very nice zoomed in)+ Great background music, and realistic soundsThis game is in Early Access so don't take these too seriously- There's an audio bug that makes the main menu music much louder after you leave a game- I wish there was a rulebook or a better tutorial that taught you how to play. I had to look up a youtube video just to learn how to play the game as the tutorial only teaches you how to hit the ball and not how to play. If you don't know how to play Snooker here is a very basic guide from what I've learned:
- To begin you break the group of red balls
- On your turn you want to hit a red ball into the pocket
- If you miss your turn ends, if you make it you then want to hit a colored ball
- If you get a colored ball into the pocket you then must hit a red ball (and repeat until you miss)
- Colored balls are worth more points, and are reset on the table each time someone hits one into the pocket. 
- The goal is to get all the red balls into the pockets, and then afterwards hit all the colored balls in order into the pocket from least to greatest value. 
- Whoever has the highest point value at the end wins

Early Access Review
								Dont buy this peice of rubbish, the AI is so terrible that you will just lose all the time. The cue ball control is non existant for the player but is spot on for the AI. If you are lucky (and i mean lucky) and you manage to get ahead in a tournament, the AI will make it almost impossible to get any kind of positional shots and you just have to sit back and watch as the AI takes frame after frame. Havent tried multiplayer yet but, going on the AI play so far, even in easy mode its almost impossible to achieve much.Its still a work in progress as i am aware but still, they could have tried to put out a better game. Someone said it was a steal for the price, well, they must have had a word with the effin AI ingame because that steals all the effin shots and frames.Just a quick update, do not use ""force play-on"" on the AI after it has commited a foul as it will place the cue ball in a convienient place therefore negating the unplayable situation it had placed itself in. Also beware of the AI calling Foul"" ""push shot"" on you when the cue ball is near the pack of reds, this is a glitch and will most certainly cost you a lot of points.And finaly, do not be disapointed when playing in the solo player tournaments, the AI is ramped up to pro level when you get into the quater finals, unless you have many hours of gameplay under your belt, its best to avoid these even when in easy mode. The AI does not like to lose thats for sure, 60 points in the lead, no problem, AI calls a foul shot, AI player makes 70+ clearance and clears the table. Who knew the AI could be so professional :-)			",16,1,1,3,9,0,3

								Well... this is a pretty tough call. I absolutely love snooker, and any snooker fan will probably love this game too, and considering the price, there's no reason not to buy it if you're into the game. However, I'd struggle to justify the purchase if you're not a fanatic.The physics are great. A game that finally accurately depicts side, yay! I've always loved my masse shots so it's pretty fun to do them on here too. They're very tricky though; no matter what power I set it to, the side kicks in earlier than the guideline shows.. perhaps that needs to be attended to?The AI is good, but needs a little more balance. This is one of the few things that were fixed in the like, two updates this game has gotten, but you still see really low level AI get perfect safety shots when they can't pot a black off its spot. Honestly. I do feel like its priority needs to be looked at to - you'll sometimes see them go for a baulk colour when they can still force something on the blue. Positional play is probably the biggest issue, and I'm sure this is something way harder to fix, and is why the hard AI is REALLY hard. They consistently play like they've already won and are playing exhibition shots. It's ridiculous. If you could improve their positional play, watch a few games, see how snooker pros make their decisions, rework the AI based around that; nigh impossible cut shots are awful to play against when you play a good safety and they get out 9 times out of 10.There have been a couple of bugs, which is fine as the game is in Early Access, but as noted earlier, barely any updates! Not good. Partly unfortunate timing due to the VR hype train and other games and whatnot, so of course this game would get sidelined as it's a bloody snooker game for crying out loud, but a little more love would make this game far more approachable. Valve haven't ditched TF2 after 8-9 years or whatever, and they're still making money off that through constant updates - show some love to the game that needs it most is what I'm saying, really. Back to the bugs though, sometimes pots wouldn't register if they almost don't go in, like it just skips to the next player's turn... sometimes the AI just plows straight into a colour off the break if you've snookered them (like literally, straight into the colour in front of them)... I found a weird one today where I loaded up an old tournament I was still in qualifying for and I was apparently losing 0 frames to 3 when it was a 1 frame game (I don't recall playing these out) and I won a frame and won the game. Pretty funny, but weird.Well, you do kinda get what Cherry Pop say... a full tournament. There really do need to be other, shorter options to make it less of a boring, monstrous challenge. Would be nice to see shorter championships, like the Masters, or the other UK / Europe ones, perhaps. Again, with lack of updates, planned features haven't made it into the game. Rest usage would be very neat, but would only really happen with a realistic shot update, which again, no bueno there. Multiplayer is there, but barely anyone is ever on, and it's pretty much the same system as Pool Nation, which is fine, but ughhhhhh.Overall, Snooker Nation Championship is a decent snooker game. Its main strength is the accurate physics and simply the fact that there's no better game around. A LOT of work needs to be done to bring it out of Early Access, which I don't see Cherry Pop doing as that effort may not be worth it for such a niche game in their eyes. But, and this is more directly to the devs, there is simply no other rival. You hold all the cards. Don't just throw them away, do something; the building blocks are there for an amazing snooker game, work on making it more user-friendly, more unique.Get it if you love snooker, you seriously will not regret. New to snooker? Only if you have the money to burn and can accept the loss of a few dollars.			",63,11,5,6,10,3,2
