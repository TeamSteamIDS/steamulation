												This game has so much potential, while at the same time is such a mess. I could recommend it, if one could play it.There are so many ""little things"" that could be implemented that could make this game ...incredible.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the worst game I've ever played. The commentary voice over is just embarassing. Very poorly made and the forced tutorial at the start is annoying as hell. And where are the ingame mouse controls?			",221,23,6,27,14,3,20
