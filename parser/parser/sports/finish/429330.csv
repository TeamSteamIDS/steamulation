												Had a blast with this over the weekend with some of my family. I make a priority to get couch games for when we're together, I have to say that this is one of our new favorites.The kids couldn't get enough of it(My played time is off, we put way more hours into it over the weekend). Usually I get to a point where its time to move on to the next local game for us to play.. I didn't with this one. The mechanics of the game feel well balanced, I love all of the strategies you can implement to knock out your opponents. The dodge/catch mechanic works extremely well, there wasn't a time where I felt I was cheated. If I got hit, it was my own fault. The game has a story mode that can be played with another player, and has unlockable characters. There are a few levels, but each of them feel fresh with the different themes and obstacles to avoid. I'd love more of them, but for now I'm content with whats there. Customizeable rules help to keep things interesting as well.All in all I feel its a great game, especially at its price point. I know this will be the first game played on the next weekend we have together, and likely many more to come.			",134,26,2,22,5,1,11

+ Great humerus cutscenes with a silly story+ Amazing visual style, everything looks fantastic+ Amusing characters+ The gameplay is pretty simple but a lot of fun with a wee bit of skill involved+ Local Multiplayer (which definitely strengthens the game if you have someone to play with)+ Interesting challenge / boss stages that mixes up the gameplay a bit+ Great silly soundtrack- The content is limited a bit, I would have liked to see a larger variety of game modes, and perhaps some more mechanics to make the gameplay a bit more intuitive. It's more or less a fun co-op game to play for a short while with friends. ",2904,1026,99,265,347,21,392

												Don't believe those negative reviews, those people are only flaming that the game doesn't offer online multiplayer. The game doesn't advertise multiplayer over the internet, so it is not even a scam or something like that. Anyway, Stikbold is truly a gem and this is why.It is really well made. The game mechanics work flawlessly and really smooth. The game idea is pretty simple, since you play Dodgeball but it is addicting, really. You can either play with a real life friend at your house or have a CPU player as a partner which works fine. I was surprised that a sports game like this would have a story and I really enjoy it so far. It is probably only taking 90 minutes or so, but the presentation is just really neat. The great silly humor really entertains you and you are motivated to play through the whole story. You encounter a lot of funny stuff on your way to completion and after that you still have the possibility to play with your buddies together (local, of course). Another pleasant thing is the soundtrack. It is flok-ish and is really nice to listen to. Reminds me of Tiny and Big: Grandpa's Leftovers. The soundtrack varies and each stage has its own song, which is a completely new one. There are probably 16-20 stages, will edit it as soon as I am through (currently 47% after 50 minutes).

												This game is so much fun to play with friends! It feels like I'm back to the times where you used to play video games with your friends in actual real life! I was playing with a friend and we laughed so much that we needed a break half way through, you get really admitted to the game and it's like it's only getting more fun the longer you play because you get better and the competition gets more exciting!I want to congratulate Game Swing because of this game, it has really brought tears to my eyes and I honestly can't wait to have my friend over again tonight to play it :)			",11,1,0,0,2,0,1

												StikBold is a fun retostyled game, I had a blast doing the co-op storeymode, but where the game really shines through is the local multiplayer smash up !! rarely have I been this entertained while at the same time harrassed or destroying my friends since Towerfall. Truely an awesome couch experience that is best enjoyed with a group of friends and a case of beer. Would recommend it to everyone!			",18,3,0,4,1,0,9

												Played through the story in one night with my wife. So you could consider it short, but we were both laughing and having way too much fun to care. Probably a lot of fun just as local VS game, but the night was over when the story was finally done. Just the right amount of challenge (My wife isn't a huge game player), very fun and silly humour, great art style and animations, ridiculous story. Would recommend if you've got a friend to play through it with, or you've got friends to play against. Never tried it solo, so it might be fine then too.			",311,64,13,37,37,2,52

												Posting a review for once to try and balance out the unfair negative reviews this game has. Almost every negative review is about it not having online play - so buyer beware, there's no online play! That aside, the game is then very good fun, especially with a friend to play the story with. Short but sweet, and the local multiplayer is a lot of fun, with or without bots. If you're buying a game for its online multiplayer, maybe you sould check it has that feature first.If anyone has specific questions, please do comment and I should see the notification and reply, but either way - don't be taken in by the negative reviews. It's great. Local only, fine. But great.			",382,124,5,33,34,2,44

Through the fire and flames with Stikbold! A Dodgeball Adventure2007 was an earnest, blissfully ignorant year. As the US economy was gearing up for an epic real-estate crash J.K. Rowling was wrapping up Harry Potter, the first iPhone was announced, and the internet collectively turned its attention towards one thing: demonstrating inarguably, with so many blurry off-screen videos and well-worn plastic guitars, that they could indeed finish Guitar Hero 3’s (2007) unofficial anthem, DragonForce’s “Through the Fire and Flames,” on expert.One could argue that Guitar Hero 3 was the last true hurrah for the series before it choked to death on so many ill-fated sequels and spin-offs, but more than just a great game its most challenging song elevated it to pop culture infamy. “Through the Fire and Flames” was the sort of thing you called your friend over to witness, strum bar clicking and gasping for breath as your fingers worked overtime on shoddily manufactured color buttons. This was the truest example of what Guitar Hero was as a game and for so many people. It brought rooms together and became a defacto party game alongside Wii Sports (2006) as something your whole family and friend group could enjoy.This is all a roundabout way to segue into talking about Stikbold! A Dodgeball Adventure (2016), a dodgeball party game by way of Denmark studio Game Swing that is neither a 2007 vintage or music game, but nevertheless conjured comparisons to Guitar Hero 3 as my girlfriend and I pummeled the devil with projectiles. Why we had ended up in hell facing off against the devil to win back the girl of our dreams isn’t important. What matters is that the devil is a bloody pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and far better at dodgeball than he has a right to be.Perhaps it was the lava or the horns or the chugging guitars, but for the entirety of this sports battle all I could think of was “Through the Fire and Flames” and how agonizing it was as well. This is Stikbold incarnate, a ridiculous pseudo-sports game at one moment, and a death metal migraine the next. When it is not causing you to chuck controllers at the screen in frustration, Stikbold is a riotous multiplayer game that channels the best elements of so many unfortunate sports comedies, from Happy Gilmore (1996) to, appropriately, Dodgeball (2004).Another pre-recession artifact, the sports comedy has been resurrected by indie developers in recent years with the likes of Sportsfriends (2013) and Videoball (2016), and Stikbold fits marvelously beside them as an asses-to-elbows couch co-op gem. A few unfortunate run-ins with Satan give way to extreme difficulty spikes, but there really is nothing quite like throwing a beehive at your best friend only to have them retaliate with a barrage of bunless hotdogs. Stikbold is the buddy-cop dodgeball epic I didn’t know I needed, and best of all Vince Vaughn is nowhere in sight.You can find more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. ",845,336,29,79,64,6,112

												Repetitive but a lot of fun. Don't yet understand why it's marketed as having coop and multiplayer; I couldn't find it. Still, good singleplayer game if you have no friends.Adding more because this review got a little attention;Sorry about small amount of hours. Doesn't take much to see all this game has to offer, though. There is a campaign with levels that vary only a little (new obstacles, different game modes here and there). Overall, you'll probably get bored pretty quick, but I'd still say to grab it on a sale if you know anyone IRL to play with.			",284,29,3,23,28,4,30

												It's quite a fun game. Got it with the humble monthly deal. Only 12 levels and i'm almost finished the story mode on professional. It's a bit of a challenge due to the AI not being too brilliant at times. Really could do with an actual person playing with you so you have someone to actually shout at rather than your screen every few minutes when the AI gets itself killed. If you want a local co-op game, I would recommend it as it would seem like fun. The story mode is decent enough but I kept having this feeling it was just an better looking flash game at times.

												This game is an absolute blast to play as a couch coop game. It's very well balanced and has hours of replayability. It has a wonderful quirky humor that adds wonderfully to the game. The only problem is  there is a glitch when using multiple controllers. However, the developers are very active in listening to input from the community and is working on the problem.

Stikbold rocks!I played the story mode with my boyfriend until we were smashed to bits, but this must be the one game where being smashed is just as much fun as powning the bots!Since we did not have quite enough, we tried some free for all, which is hilarious fun as well.Great maps with funny and surprising obstacles that appear apparently out of nowhere until you are dead and steer some of them yourself.This game is surely best with some friends over - gamer or none gamer (so easy to learn the controls) and whack the whales out of each other!

												A simple dodgeball arena game. Decent music and graphics, colorful world and uses the blocky human style similar to games like Minecraft and Thirty Flights of Loving. A decent lighthearted nonsensical story and voices are only in (although subtitles are available for multiple languages).Rules are pretty simple: Game starts with the single ball dropping in the center of the arena. You can throw, pass, dodge, or catch the ball. You can also do a melee shove to make an opponent drop the ball. Two hits within a couple seconds knocks you out (permanently in harder modes or until your partner revives you in easier modes). And there are often random objects in the environment that can be thrown (only for the first hit; the ball is needed for the second hit).The campaign is 12 missions with three optional challenges per mission (such as eliminating an opponent with a curving long shot). While the first-to-three regular dodgeball matches were fine, I had more fun with the bosses (which are less dodgeball and more action game). The AI companion is good enough as medium-skill partner (it almost always passes the ball to you to make the shot and can dodge decently) but it's not good enough to handle the harder AI or well coordinated humans. Sometimes it'll make a terrible mistake and randomly get knocked out or pass the ball to the enemy but I've made mistakes just as bad. Just don't rely on it and treat it as an extra life/a ball collector.In the higher difficulties you have to keep your eye out for incoming projectiles and use your dodge roll perfectly. Otherwise the enemy will just hit you once your roll ends. It can just become a series of throws into catches/dodges until one side gets a lucky hit.While I had my x360 controller plugged in, it became the sole method of control. No option to switch controls. While fine for me (I don't keep my controller plugged in all the time), may be annoying for those who do. Controls are remappable for keyboard but not controller. The diagram showing controller controls didn't show the pass button (RB for me).Unfortunately, there is only local coop (no online multiplayer). At least you can do the campaign as coop.Some things I'd like to have:Better outlined text. Sometimes the font blends together and is hard to read (Especially the red team victory screen)Actual volume sliders instead of having to cycle through all options to lower the volumeAn option to constrain the mouse cursor to the window in windowed modeAn option to automatically pause the game when it goes out of focusTo be able to toggle challenge descriptions instead of it disappearing and reappearing every few seconds. Makes it a little annoying to read. Or the descriptions could be separate from the flower showing if you already completed the challenge.While playing I saw some visual bugs but nothing too severe. There were some model clipping issues in cutscenes and a random scratch line across the dialogue box. Thought the scratch might have been on my actual screen but it followed the window when I moved it.Worth a look if arcadey/gamey dodgeball interests you and you don't mind the presentation/silly theme. It allows you to skip cutscenes (hold space on keyboard) if you find the story/characters grating.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this game in a Humble Montly bundle, I didnt get on the store page and look at the videos or anything, heres a rundown of my first 20 minutes or so.Boot up the game and greeted with some menus to pick text language and some other stuff I believe, then greeted with some cutesy bright block characters and areas. At first look this seems to be a game about some guys that are semi-pro dodgeball players, you do a little warm-up round to learn the controls (which are very easy to use, I've been playing with the steam controller and it's a ton of fun) After the little training session two females walk into the gym, one of your characters has the hots for one of them, you learn he gave up the win to her team last season. After this, everything starts to get more and more bizarre. First the female love interest is stolen by the devil, then you fight hippies that (I'm assuming) have made some sort of hash-honey, and during this fight thir van is driving around hitting everyone, theres bees, all hell breaks loose. I laughed until I cried and then cried more because I got ran over and killed by the honey hippies. I'll just leave it at that. The game just gets crazier and more ridiculous as it goes along. I'm not even half done with the game and I'm blown away by every match. Only downside to the game is there is no online multiplayer.I'd pay $10+ for a sequel with online multiplayer.

												Hey, I'm Emperor Maciek. I decided to do some video game reviews. Since everyone is doing it I figured it is a fun way to compare experiences.Here is my review after first 30 minutes of play.Graphics: 8 - Cartoony but perfectly fitting this sort of goofy/cartoony game.Sound: 7 - Soudtrack is pretty decent so far, the voice acting is quirky but well done. The sound effects could use a bit more variation but it hasn't yet ruined the expeirence.Controls: 9 - Responsive, So far I only used the wired Xbox360 controller, not the mouse and keyboard or two player (a person on each)Fun Factor: 8 - So far the game is fun, has a nice storyline and doesn't take itself all too seriously. The feel matches the graphics and sound so I would recommend playing it.I will return to review after I finish the game for a full review. Enjoy			",538,145,19,66,52,5,96

												I didn't know what to expect when I launched Stikbold.  A friend and I were looking for a fun co-op game to play locally, I saw that Stikbold had co-op, and the rest is history.What we found in Stikbold was a nice looking game in terms of artistry, and an entertaining way to spend an afternoon.  That said, we breesed through the story mode fairly quickly, but there are cool things that add some replayability, like the flower/challenges in each level, and (probably primary) versus mode, where you can and will spend hours duking it out dodgeball-style with friends.I've never tried playing this game solo, so I can't speak for that.  But the co-op experience is a lot of fun, and I recommend that highly! Pick this one up if you have a chance!			",320,85,4,57,46,2,67

												Stikbold! After playing for a few hours I can say that this is the type of game that I love keeping installed all the time. People complain that it's missing online multiplayer, which it does...but considering I can't convince more than two friends to play the same game online at once, I absolutely adore the story and local multiplayer options. If you grew up holding Super Dodge Ball up as THE game to play for Dodgeball action, this game has the same fun feel in spades and TONS of unlockables, stages, and the music is fantastic. I love the humor and the ability to skip past cutscenes. If you have some folks to play local multiplayer or just want a really fun game to give you many hours of enjoyment, Stikbold! A Dodgeball Adventure is worth the price of admission!			",331,92,9,59,33,3,53

												Stikbold is a colourful, groovy co-op game reminiscent of Dodgeball that takes place in a variety of fun and interesting battlegrounds. You and a player/CPU battle it out against a range of different opponents, with a bunch of fun modes and funky music to boot.However, I can't help but say that the sometimes-useless AI teammates can really make it a frustrating experience if you're playing solo. Playing with friends is great however, and the AI is usually fine, when outside of boss battles. ",40,9,0,7,7,0,2

												Nice and simple gameplay with a few tricks to master. All in blocky art style with great sound. Free mode offers 5 unique arenas. The story mode comes with 12, again very unique, and with quite unusual boss battles. Both modes can be mastered solo, co-op and/or vs bots or real friends that bring their own controllers :P			",208,75,4,21,32,1,31

												I have been on a spree to buy local co-op games because friends come over quite often and this happened to be one of them. Needless to say it was an amazing purchase. I bought it for the retail price.Right when you hop into a quick match it's just super fun, you dive, dodge, and catch balls that are thrown at you, while also attempting to get the opponents out. My friends and I did free-for-all and team play and both were just as good as the last.Pros-Team Play/Free-For-All-Story mode -Quick match-Unlockable characters-Custom gameplay options-Fun interactables in game-Death is just as fun as living because you can use different attacks to get the current opponents out.-Fun maps-Simple controls-Good design Cons-Could have more maps and game modesOverall this game is a wonderful purchase, nice developers and gameplay. Purchase this game if you want a fun local co-op game to play with friends. 11/10 ",124,14,3,5,12,1,1

The humour, the retro look, the sounds and the gameplay were fantastic and made us all so happy. I would recomend this game. The game does need an Online Multiplayer though! Playing against bits gets old fast, and you cant really have many people playing from the same PC at the same time, 2 max really.

												Actually a very decent game. The campaign, although short, is really interesting and levels are unique. The levels aren't too difficult, but they can be if you increase the difficulty and want to complete all the challenges. The mechanics are simple but fun and the visuals are very pleasant to the eye. However the game was meant for consoles and it shows. The game doesn't  have online multiplayer and I can't see how local multiplayer would work if you don't have a controller. I would recommend the game if you have a controller and want something to play with friends.  The AI isn't very helpful either if you want to play the campaign alone.			",138,20,5,13,19,0,10

												Stikbold is a very casual, simple and plain game. Sure it has its own charm with the artstyle (which I personally disliked) and humor, but it gets old quickly. The game is fun for a few hours and then it gets old, granted it might be more fun to play in co-op which I didn’t try. To play in co-op you need at least 1 extra controller and up to 3 controllers for even more players. Still, this doesn’t seem like a type of game a group of adults would choose to play. Stikbold looks like it was made for families and youth to enjoy in a casual setting. So unless you are in one of those 2 demographics, I wouldn’t recommend this game. For me it just didn’t stick.

												If you are looking for local multiplayer, then look no further. This is easily the best of its kind on Steam. Most epic gaming fun have had in ages! Grab a few gamepads, kick back on the couch and get ready for some hilarious fun. Co-op adventure mode is really funny and the difficulty is just right. The characters are really funny and the unlocks are perfect too. Just wish there was more content. Anyway, you're going to absolutely love this!			",244,75,19,7,13,5,24

												At first I tried this game with the keyboard, In my opinion it was very hard to learn.. After a while I stoppedd and the next day I played this game with my brother with ps3 controllers. We had a lot of fun and we laughed a lot. The game has a story mode that you can play with somebody else locally or you can play it solo. In this story mode you can win new levels (maps) and new characters. The maps are really different from each other and each map adds a lot of aspect to the game. For example if you die and other people are still playing, you are still playing from the sideline for example you can throw a beach ball once in a while etc. So it's not like you are spectating the game, you are still participating. The graphics are great and I had no issues with lag. I have only played it for 2 hours upto this point, but the first look and start is really great!			",101,25,1,9,13,1,3

												Local multiplayer is something that I'm grateful still exists. Towerfall, Gangbeasts and now Stikbold! all fall into the ""have a couple of beers with your friends, laugh and get your a$$ kicked""-category of games, which I love. Stikbold!, since it's a dodgeball game, works best when played free-for-all with 3-4 people in my opinion. Everyone can play this game (""pick up the ball and shoot"" isn't too hard to do), which is why I'd recommend it to families as well as friend groups. If you're a skilled gamer there are tips and tricks for you to use as well - curve balls, dodges and such.The story mode actually surprised me, in a good way, though. It's a fun story, but should be played co-op (""no one's a team alone"") if you want to unlock all achievements and get the most out of it, since the bot's a bit clueless at times and prefers to leave things up to you.Lastly, it's definitely best to play this game with controllers! The keyboard's alright, but a controller is really the way to go.			",122,49,1,18,15,2,24

												This game has a lot of potential, but it has a big problem, there is an ability that lets you puch people and steal the ball, and with that ability every one bum rushes the person with the ball and dodges into him then all 4 people continually punch eachother around because it is easier than throwing the ball and somemaps it will kill you.At the end, an overpowered ability makes this game unplayable for vs mode, and i have no interest in coop			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Came for the intentionally bad  localisation / cultural references (e.g. honey hippies) stayed for the brilliant deep dodge-ball combat. Awesome couch coop (or vs.) as well as deep single player story. 12 hrs later still honing my stickbold skills and learning more and more.Hilarious fun game.			",404,138,26,57,38,5,76

												This game is a must-have if you're into co-op parties.  I connected 4 controllers and my TV to my PC for a party and it was easily the best $10.00 I've ever spent in my life.The steam pics don't do this game enough justice.  I had very low hopes for this game, and grabbed it on a whim, but you have to trust me on this -- it's hysterical.  The music, the gameplay, all the little sneak moves you can do, the wierd 70's porn vibe the game has ... just trust me.If you're having a co-op party, BUY THIS GAME.  You're welcome.

												Fun concept, but the game runs into a bunch of bad design decisions on the mega coach fight if you are playing story mode solo:1) Bad AI partner that gets downed constantly2) Infinitely spawning enemies3) Too much ""boss time"" where the boss cannot be hit4) ""Friendly fire"" where the idiot AI partner will constantly take you outThe frustration that came from this stage is a massive difficulty spike and enough to make me not want to come back to this game.

YouTube™ Video: Stikbold! Review - Steam Gameplay 

			Views: 657		

			Greetings fellow gamers! This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) back with a review for a BRAND NEW Indie game that's just amazingly hilarious, Stikbold!		

Greetings fellow gamers!This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) back with a review for a BRAND NEW Indie game that's just amazingly hilarious, Stikbold!Stikbold is essentially an indie game with a 70's-era Dodgeball feel to it. Yeah. Dodgeball. It's even officially endorsed. The game provides both a Quick Match mode, and a Story Mode. Stikbold can be played solo, but it's best played as a local co-op. This is buddy-game playing at it's finest. The story is quite funny and charming, and the music is downright funky. The gameplay is clearly desinged around a controller, although a mouse and keyboard can be used. I would suggest using a controller. The Steam Contoller works flawlessly with this, as does my Logitech. By completeing parts of the story mode (and it's various challenges!), you can unlock new players to use in the Quick Match mode of the game. QUick Match boasts two modes, one being Teams and the other being an all out Free-For-All. THese are more dodgeball related than the actual Story mode, which integrates some gameplay as well (battling a whale, dodging a VW Bus, etc)Positives:+ Delightfully cheerful and funny+ Fantastic little game for hanging with a friend+ Incredibly smooth and easy gameplay. Quick to pick up.+ Great SoundtrackNegatives:- Solo is fun, but gets boring after the Story Mode is complete. A lot rides on MP.I couldn't find much wrong with this little indie game. It is fun, and even made my friend that's NOT a gamer in any way give it a try and he quite enjoyed it. I'm positive you will too.It's worth about $10, and you can grab it now at 20% off. It's worth it. Verdict:7/10Happy Gaming!			",1201,557,39,163,210,15,217

												Stikbold is a competitive top down multiplayer game smoothly based on dodgeball. It is a fun game but I sadly doesn't have any friends to play with, I wish I could play with my imaginary friends.There's an AI to help you in story mode but.. it barely helps you. There should be a button to switch characters other than passing the ball. Also the game is far from being ported correctly but it's still playable			",458,94,4,31,48,5,30

												The first time I played Stikbold I briefly tried the story mode in single player. It seemed like it might be fun with friends and worked just fine with my Steam controller. Today I tried it again, and it seems multiplayer is impossible since I have the ""phantom controller"" problem that some other people seem to have. When I try the game with just one controller, the controller works, but not with the other controller. This setup worked just fine with Rocket League, but apparently not with Stikbold.Moreover, about 50% of the time when I start the game it crashes after watching the unskippable intro credits of the 76 different groups that worked with the game. This might be a fun game, if it worked properly. Apparently this is too much to ask in current year. So no, I don't recommend Stikbold.I wanted a fun console-esque distraction. I don't want to have wade through all of these technical problems just to play a simple game like this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Note: I was given an advance key in order to play this game on my YouTube channel ALT PLAY.A silly take on the very serious sport of dodgeball, Stikbold! is a great battle game meant for local play. The game features control with keyboard and mouse as well as controller support, a plus for any who prefer to use twinsticks to move and aim. I was engaged throughout the entire story mode and can't wait to play this mode again with friends in co-op. The difficulty ramps very quickly and also provides a proper challenge through bosses with different methods for defeating them and achievements to obtain in every level. Definitely a great game to experience.			",132,52,1,19,16,1,11

												Such a quirkly little game that feels incredibly polished and has a crazy story with refined gameplay (what a mouthful!)I played this with my friend at Eurogamer 2015 and the developers were all awesome friendly people, and it was easily one of the most fun games we played whilst there. I definitely think it's more fun if you have a friend or sibling to play through it with, but the solo experience is still fun in itself!For £8, I can't think of many other games you'll get this amount of fun from.

												I love dodgeball. I'm one of the few nerdy, fat, bullied kids who loved playing dodgeball in gym class. I took it as the only oportunity I had to hurt and humiliate the popular kids who made my life a living hell. I have good memories, and have always wanted to play a good dodgeball video game.Mechanics are solid, this is not the dodgeball I know as you can run around freely across the playing are instead of being confined to your team's space. This allows you to not only dodge the incoming fire, but also tackle opposing players and steal the ball. (maybe this is a European version of the rules, or something the game made up on its own) Not a huge fan of the mechanics, but it is still the dodgeball I love.My problem is the annoying aesthetics. The character models are ugly, the story is dumb, and there's just something off about the whole package. I love colorful and quirky aesthetics a lot, but this game is really rubbing me the wrong way with its approach. This might be truly subjective, but I really dislike this game. If you want to play another cutsy, quirky game play Roundabout.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an absolute mess. This port is insanely bad, and they had no intent of keeping some sort of playerbase to pc. Why make a local co op game good for 5 minutes of laughs. This is jsut another meme game being pushed out by the powers that be. and is to be avoided at all costs. Do not waste your time. Do not waste your money.			",296,50,5,37,25,2,34

												NOTE DEVELOPER GAVE KEY BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT I'M GOING TO SUGAR COAT THIS REVEIW When i got this game, i wasn't to sure the trailer didn't really excite me, so when day I was bored, and I decided to play this game, and boy was I wrong this game is FANTASTIC. Now it does have its flaws, and you might want to configure your controls (i had to configure the curve because C to curve was not working out for me) but other than that, you can tell it was made by Russians? (I don't know the accent, but i can tell it wasn't American.) Now i don't mind the culture of the developer, but I think he/her/them should get some dubbed actors. It's kind of sad for me to having to read during the cutscenes although, it's not that big of a deal. Now the cons are awesome, I am on a Toshba windows 10 and the graphics are amazing for this game, and i'm surprised my PC can run it in High Quality. The gameplay is pretty awesome, the characters are kind of annoying but it doesn't really matter. It's kind of a goofy game in my opinion, it doesn't have real competive wish is what i think was the dev's intention. It would be awesome if the dev had some kind online multiplayer so I can get my freinds to buy the game, when we have game night we are bored out of our minds by the same games, so this would give us another variety. This reveiw probably makes no sense mostly because I'm making it when I just woke up XD, but i hope this helps.			",74,18,2,9,6,1,7

												This game is absolutely amazing! I played it at PAX East and went home and bought that very night, I love playing it but it has lost it's replay value because there is only local multiplayer which limits the amount of times I can play it with friends. As soon as they add Online Multiplayer to this game I would play it so much more.			",33,0,1,0,0,0,1

												Do you have 3 friends?  Do you have 4 controllers?  Did you likethe dodgeball movie?  The last is not really a requirement, I'm just curious.  This is not the best local multilpayer game out there, but it doesn't need to be.  Get it on sale and add it to your local multiplayer line up for the next time you've got friends over.  It's very fun in small doses, and you can keep coming back to it in small doses.  Also, you can throw people off cliffs			",581,133,14,85,83,7,160
