												If you're a fan of Pagani and interested in getting into sim racing this is the game for you. While it is lacking in tracks, features and cars that doesn't matter because this is really more of a demo for the full game than anything else.The majority of complaints coming from others about the handling are completely justified because as a racing simulator, Project Cars almost demands a racing wheel to be enjoyed. However with some tweaking of the in game settings you can easily set up a controller to work fairly well. I can't stress the simulation aspect enough as without driving assists the cars on offer can be fairly difficult to control especially because none of the lower powered street cars are available in the demo. The game also tracks tire temperature but fails to explain that for maximum grip to be achieved the tires have to reach a certain temperature (around 100Â° C) so a minimum of 1 lap needs to be completed before the cars handle properly. The cars on offer all kick side to side when leaving the pit and when quickly accelerating can easily spin out so a controller just won't offer enough degrees of motion to counter act this without assists. I personally use a Logitech G29 with a shifter and in both the full game and this demo the cars are perfectly manageable to drive albeit with some practice.Some people will try and convince you that this is just an arcadey version of Assetto Corsa which simply put it's not. Both games while racing simulators have very different design philosophies and so deciding which one you prefer will really come down to personal preference. A point to consider is that Project Cars has a demo now while Assetto Corsa doesn't. Like the full game however this demo carries over the weather settings from the full game for the race weekends which adds variety, unfortunately car tuning options are not present in the demo as far as I can tell.Considering that Project Cars with all the dlc is still fairly expensive even when on sale, downloading the fairly small demo isn't a bad idea to get an idea whether or not sim racing is for you. If you find you don't like this demo at least you don't need to worry about exceeding your refund period.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
