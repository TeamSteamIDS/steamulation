												I have been playing this game for the last hour after purchasing it on sale at a silly cheap price.I read the other reviews before purchasing, they are currently few and mixed.  Somebody mentioned that it has too many keys, it doesn't have many at all, and you can view them at any time by clicking the question mark at the bottom.The AI is different, but not in a bad way, the drones hide, pop out to attack, run away etc.  I think it works well for the type of game.The mentioned issue with the level not auto restarting, not sure if this has changed, but it sends you straight back to the level select screen, at which point you are one click from restarting the level, or choosing a different one if you desire, seems fine to me.Difficulty may be an issue for some, I'm an old school gamer who misses the days when games actually provided a challenge, and this does.  The game is well balanced though, stick with it and I'm sure you will get the hang of it, just requires learning a few simply techniques, after which the game takes on a whole new lease of life, fantastic!I cannot recommend this game more, think Paradroid 90 with a dark atmosphere, and without the takeover minigame.  Graphics and audio are perfect for the type of game.This dev deserves a lot of credit for the game, I'm so glad I found it !   If it is your thing then buy it, enjoy it, and please give positive reviews if you do.  It annoys me that four out of the eight reviews I can see are not recommending this game, half of them, WHAT !!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a bit unusual and is not that fun, but considering it was worth cents and comes with steam cards, I would have to say, get it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simple but decent idea, however the game requires super human reflexes. The second you see a single pixel of the enemy they are already moving and shooting at you. Restarting a level is clunky and takes to long.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
