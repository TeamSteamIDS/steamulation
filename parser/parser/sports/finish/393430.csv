												Good game. As an ice fisherman myself, I can say that it is exactly what it says it is... Ice Fishing. I think the graphics are OK for what it is, the gameplay is good, and I'm enjoying my time with it so far.One downside is that there is no tutorial (at least that I noticed). Meaning, if you don't know ice fishing already, you could be lost. Some simple instructions would go a long way. A couple of tips for starters: You need to run out on the lake, pick a spot, drill a hole with your auger, BAIT your hook/jig (there are grubbs that go on the hook or you won't catch anything). You can vary your depth using your mouse wheel (where I live, slightly off the bottom is where you fish, but other depths can work). There is a strainer next to the hole to keep ice out of the hole (click on it, I think I caught more fish when the hole was clear). Watch the end of the pole, when you get a hit, hit the F button on your keyboard or use the reel icon on the screen to pull up the line. Lastly, there is a bait shop near where you started for bait, etc. and when the time is running down, get back to that area to have your score count! Not exactly ""review"" material, but I hope this is some help to you.All in all, a good ice fishing game that I'd recommend to a friend. I haven't tried the multiplayer yet...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off, its not bass or ocean fishing, its important to keep that in mind when playing it. Ice fishing is not fast paced or about the fights, its about the right lure in the right location.Graphics could be better but honestly they are better then alot of other $12 games out there. Animation motions are smooth and did not experience any clipping issues.Multi-player is a fun idea, seeing others running around digging holes and jumping spot to spot on the ice.The sounds in the game are accurate and good.Did not seem to be drawing anything from my second video card but the game ran very smooth with no crashes or hang-ups.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys fishing, we dont have enough fishing games out there to pick from and to the collectors of group multiplayer games.

												Is it the most realistic ice fishing game? Definitely not. Is it fun? Absolutely! Especially when played with friends over voice chat.The devs have assuredly played Pro Pilkki before, since there are quite a lot of similarities in the game mechanics and that is not a bad thing. For years Pro Pilkki has been the best ice fishing game out there and it's really a time for it to have some competition. Does Ice Lakes provide the competition? I'd like to think so. It has it's ups and downs but over time this game could take the spot as #1 ice fishing game, assuming the devs will provide updates and fixes to it.Ice Lakes is still fresh out of the oven and that can be seen, especially on the multiplayer front. Hosting a game / being able to join a friends game can be quite a pain in the buttocks. Setting a password or lowering the max players value don't seem to have an affect. But once you get going, it's really fun and I'm  optimistic that these small problems will be fixed in coming updates.If you are expecting realism, then you might be a bit disappointed. The fish weights and amount of fish you are able to catch can seem quite absurd at times. 1.2kg ruffe.. that's something I'd like to see IRL ;) If you are up for some arcade ice fishing, then this game is definitely something to try out!5/5, will recommend!
