Early Access Review
								Keeping an eye on this game all the way back from when it first appeared on Greenlight, Crazy Pixel Streaker is a pretty good entry in Steam Early Access. The developers put everything in there that they promised they would do so far. A working online mode, small character customizations with hats that you get from bosses and give you different bonuses, The Party Mode with a cute minigame that is kind of like Rocket League.All of this however, is just a framework. CPS has the potential of having so much more stuff in it. More stadiums, more crazy weapons and character customization, more mini games that have party game potential....Now the important question: Would I recommend you to buy it at this early stage?I would say yes!It is already super fun to beat the living hell out of everything that tries to stop you in your mission to streak around and it gets even better with a couple of friends (and probably a beer or two :D).Don't let yourself get fooled though! Despite of its more ""cute"" retro graphics style this game is extremely challenging and whether you play alone or team up with your friends, you're going to find yourself thinking about a plan and some tactics to survive long enough to finally go into the bossfight, without having every item used already and dying within the next hit.For now CPS will probably give you around 15-20h of fun before you did and see everything.I'm going to keep this review updated when the development advances.

+ The gameplay is fun and silly, and consists of running around beating everyone on the field up or shooting everyone on the field and causing a ton of chaos+ Lots of weapon pick-ups / power ups+ Challenging Bosses+ Great soundtrack+ Random events making for a different experience each time you play+ Up to 4-player co-op / Local or Online+ Pretty amusing concept to see streakers cause so much chaosThis game is in Early Access so don't take these too seriously- Very RNG based, if you don't have enough power ups / weapons you won't be able to beat any of the bosses, and you can die very easily if you get unlucky and don't find any food drops.- I feel like the humor of this game could be enhanced if the streakers were actually nude, at the moment they all look like they are in swimsuits... perhaps a toggle in the options menu could be added. - You collect a ton of coins, gems, sacks of cash but it doesn't seem like there's a purpose for it. I'd like to see a shop of some sort added to buy upgrades / weapons. ~ You can launch all your followers at once to cause damage. I feel like this would be more enjoyable if you had the option to launch them one at a time.			",2904,1026,99,265,347,21,392

								Info 1: I got  a key from the Devs but bought also for the full price a copy so don't call be ""b1tch.""Info 2: Need more ACTIVE testers. Main partYou have to knock out and to kill wave of enemies- with bear hands and feets or random dropped weapons.+ A LOT funny animations, sounds and extras you will experience.~It's Early Access, sure, but the Single player it's currenty ""Easy to play. Hard to master."" Lubiterum Games needs your help for the perfect Gameplay =3 OpinionCrazy Pixel Streaker gives you a strong dose of Humor in pixel-style which I never meeted before.And if you don't like sports like football- here is no mercy.So


Let's start the Craziness !

												he game seems to be having great potential with 3-4 players on local shared screen. But if you are buying this for only local single-player only, be ready to at least disappointment. But with your friends in locally or via internet, this game might be very fun to play.I press thumb up, because this game is better played with some friends local or via internet.

								This is the kind of game that Steam needs more of. I've played this game both in single player mode and multiplayer. I can't even get past Guillermo on my own, but it's definitely much more intense and fun when playing multiplayer with friends. Also, I personally prefer playing on a TV with controllers rather than using mouse and keyboard :DSince it's an early access you can expect a few bugs here and there, but I've got a strong feeling that this game will be much more than it is by the time it's officially released ♥			",55,39,1,20,10,0,1

												Great party game with friends. Playing alone makes you remember your undying sadness and  that your friends don't apreciate you enough to spend 10$ and remain your freinds. The gameplay is solid and challenging enough to give you a good run for your money, the story is awesomr (nuff' said), the music if pretty hot and the animations are fun and well done. Overall, great game!			",161,21,0,22,12,0,9
