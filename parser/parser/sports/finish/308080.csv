								If u liked  Sonic & all-stars racing or Skydrift ,Altitude0is a must-have arcade/racing game.No,it doesnt have guns like the titles above but it doesnt lack in anything. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Traps in the flags and aero tricks give a nice playthrough. The game modes are: solo license,championship mode and users tracks.Variety in the difficulty of maps,though a new content / update is always welcomed.+ Able to choose control modes (arcade and advancedmode for more simulated flying)+ The  menu interface seems polished + Steam inventory drops,not necessary feature but its still nice to see+ Superb soundtrack+ Track editor is available,a good way for new content~ Online features exist but not many players out there yet (AI exist though,with rankings from ghost players/other users scores)---------------------------------------------------------------------Overall,i would recommend this game,it gets oftenupdated so far,hope to see new content/updates in future (for planes,enviroment-maps,plane parts etc)			",633,206,30,42,52,10,88

								Trackmania with planes! In Altitude0 you race against the ghosts of other players on many different, and some whacky, tracks. At the current version there are three planes to choose from, all with slightly variying characteristics.Having spent more time with the game now, seeing the development pace, a small review correction was in line - the pilot wings experience i was talking about could still be achieved, but i don´t think it is going to happen soon´ish =)[old review]My short ""early access"" summary so far, even with some vital features still missing:If you always wanted ""Pilot Wings"" on PC (for the last 20 fricking years), this finally could be it - if (!) some vital  features like steam workshop support, an in-depth license system, stronger single player, and live multiplayer against friends made it into the game quickly.[/old review]			",227,34,12,25,20,1,32

								I don't remember when was last time when I truly enjoyed racing game with planes. Even tho it's more of arcade game than simulator, it's really great. It's fun to complete training and gaining title of A0 Master, it's fun to beat weekly/overall records of certain maps and compete with others, it's fun to play on multiplayer and singleplayer. Sadly, there aren't many players and mostly you will play alone (you can do that on both single and multi option) but I hope it will change after game will leave early access. You can also customize your plane with special skins and stickers, which drops weekly like in CS:GO. With team of 2 people updates are going rather slowly but there is tracks editor, so if you think there aren't enough maps you can try yourself at making one. Even if this game is still in early access, it's at playable stage. I think Altitude0: Lower & Faster as final product will be something great.			",1735,712,60,244,224,20,321
