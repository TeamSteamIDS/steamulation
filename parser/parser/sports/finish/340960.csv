Early Access Review
								From the viewpoint of someone who is hardcore into Rhythm gaming I just can't recommend Pulsen for its cost.If you're looking for a packaged standalone experience that requires no additional setup and is super casual friendly, then it might be the game for you. But for an advanced user, who is already accustomed to modifying a game like StepMania to fit my needs, I find the experience lacking.  There is the promise of a song editor coming eventually and steam workshop integration, but nothing you can't already get in SM for free. No custom themes, noteskins appear to be limited to paid DLC, limited mod-ability. The chart gimmicks are cute, but I don't really feel the same depth in them as other packs. Look up WinDEU or charts made for D.O.W.N.S. for some examples. And as far as overall difficulty, even the most challenging of charts was relatively tame compared to the majority of what I commonly play on SM/FFR.If you're a pad player, you can expect a similar experience to picking up an old console copy of DDR or ITG in terms of content and customization options. And if you're OK with that, and you rather not deal with setting up everything yourself (if you haven't already) then you should probably get this game. Nothing but respect to the developers, they are trying, they do listen to feedback. Its simply not something I'm looking for as a veteran rhythm gamer.			",396,71,5,36,62,7,41

								I have been with Pulsen for quite a while, probably before it was even a thought to have it pushed to major platforms like Steam. So that is a forewarning that I have seen it develop and have helped it along in what little way I can over the years. Take that as you will.TL;DR:>Wide variety of difficulty and styles>Varied songs, some may even be familiar>Based on Stepmania 5, polished to a shine>Many features to come to enhance experienceDetails:It has calm charts for easing in new players, up to mind-bending charts to challenge the hardcore. It supports keyboard, dance pad, and controllers, with separated scores as well. And as with most dance games, you can modify scroll speed and change other effects. You can find your exact playstyle, and tweak it on the fly.The songs within are varied, with more to come as the game rolls through Early Access. VVVVVV even appears with familiar tunes, and veterans of Stepmania and the like might have other songs bring nostalgia.Speaking of; this is based on Stepmania 5, but is practically brand new. It has a sleek new paint job full of flashy colors smothered in purple. Those familiar with it will be right at home.There is still quite a bit of polish to be done, hence the Early Access. Many features are planned to come. The devs are quite active, so any details players can provide would be wonderful.This is highly recommended for anyone who needs to sate the urge to bring out dance pads to stamp on, or mash their keyboard pushing for high scores. As I have been with Pulsen for so long, I may be a tiny bit biased, again take that as you will. This game has delivered great fun for me for years now, always pushing myself to best my own scores, let alone the dev's scores. But the trailer shows I have at least beat him on one song, so muahahaha~			",127,22,1,30,8,3,23

								- Dance game based on StepMania 5- Unique theme- Steam integration- Nice developer who responds relatively quickly to feedbackI've been playing OpenITG pretty casually for a little over two years now, but Pulsen seems like the game that will finally have me pushing to beat my scores and playing much more regularly!The charts are pretty fun, and the song choices are pretty good too. I also like the usage of the Lift note (I've seen very few custom songs for SM5 that have incorporated it).			",85,3,3,6,3,0,5

Early Access Review
Born to BeatNeon lights and techno music engulf you in this fast paced music and rhythm game. Pulsen’s high BPM tracks will have you moving along to the beat as you scurry to match the corresponding controller prompts. With full support for keyboards, gamepads, dance pads, and Rock Band drums, be prepared to let the music flow and put your reflexes to the test. Local coop is supported.GameplaySong SelectionThere are approximately 80 songs that are fully playable to choose from at the moment, with more being added throughout the duration of Early Access. Most of these songs are techno/EDM with high BPM – beats per min (131+). Like with all music games, there will be some tracks that appeal to you, with others being a bit less attractive in an effort to satisfy wider audiences.The typical HUD includes the: notes, receptors, success meter, time remaining, and # of notes hit/remaining. Upon selecting a song, modifications can be activated and manually changed for personalization. These include: note skins, receptor effects, etc. A screenshot presenting all of these possible options are provided below.

By: silversuriv




A score is provided at the end of each song. The score is boosted by maintaining a long multiplier (don’t miss a beat). Hitting the note “perfectly” does not affect the score, just whether you managed to hit it at all. Continually missing a note will cause a meter to degrade, and by missing enough notes, eventually leading to a fail. This meter can be replenished by consistently hitting more notes.Difficulty LevelsThere are 5 difficulty levels you can choose to play for each song: Beginner, Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert. The main difference in these levels include: note count, on what beat the notes are presented, long-press notes, simultaneous button prompts, mines (do not press), etc. The Beginner difficulty level is sufficiently easy enough for a child, or someone completely new to gaming, to understand and handle, whereas the Expert difficulty level will make rhythm game veterans sweat.In addition to the above, certain songs will add another layer of difficulty by adding effects to make the songs themselves seem alive (on higher difficulty levels). These effects manifest themselves to the beat by: scrunching and releasing multiple notes, swerving the note board, vibrating the receptors, drastically increasing or decreasing the note space/layout, etc. This feature makes it insanely fun to explore each song and find a favorite one to master.Video Gameplay

Game OptionsAudio-visual CalibrationThere are visual and audio sync calibrations to help if anything seems to be a little off on your setup. For those that have never tried playing a rhythm game on a TV with a non-standard gamepad before, syncing problems can arise and it is very great that Pulsen includes these options. ConclusionCurrent State of the GamePulsen is currently in Early Access. For those that are not aware of the Early Access concept, it is perfectly acceptable for bugs to be present (none observed) and game mechanics to be missing. Right now, there are 80 fully playable songs, with at least 100 included in the main game after the full release. Art is being updated and a tutorial will be added. Regarding the developers themselves, they seem to be very active and show a lot of care and concern needed to make Pulsen flourish, as seen on the Discussions board. Developer updates are transparent, troubleshooting threads have a direct response, and most important of all, suggestions and concerns of Early Access supporters seem to be acknowledged and accepted.VerdictPulsen brings back the nostalgia of when I was a little kid playing DDR on my Playstation. Trying to stay as unbiased as possible, this DDR inspired music and rhythm game gets all of the important parts right in an effort to carry on the legacy of the legend in PC form on Steam. With seemingly no other competitor in this niche genre/playstyle (on Steam), Pulsen is recommended to any fan of DDR or rhythm games.

Early Access Review
								As a StepMania and osu!mania player, my opinion may be a little biased here and there. Things I enjoyed Graphics The game is probably the best looking VSRG around. The Music  While not the kind of music I enjoy most of the time, it works. I would personally love more high-bpm songs, hardstyle, eurobeat, etc. though. Things I did not enjoy  The difficulty  The difficult part about these maps is that it isn't the actual note mapping that makes the songs hard, it's the scroll speed changes and various effects. Coming from SM and o!m where such effects are unusual, the scroll speed changes annoy me. Yes, such effects should have a place in maps, though I feel they are majorly disruptive to the general flow of how a map goes (see CTRL ALT BELIEVE @ approx 0:45). Lack of Variety with Note Patterns  (Going to use some SM-terminology) In Pulsen, most of the maps I played (admittedly not many of them though) had rather simple patterns. They mostly consisted of rolls, trills and a few jumps. What I would like to see are maps that challenge you with note patterns, and not Scroll Speed changes. An example for a somewhat challenging map from StepMania would be  Everytime I Hear Your Name  consisting of mostly jumpstreams, rolls (1:10~) and eventually a handstream (at around 1:17). This is the kind of mapping I want to see. Difficulty finding fixed speed in modifications  I had to fool around with the Note Scroll Speed Multiplier before I realised the option for ""fixed"" scroll speed even existed. I would also like more options for fixed scroll speed, increments of 50 are okay, but I would like to be able to choose even more. Few songs and lack of difficult songs  I realise this is something that most likely would be fixed when the editor is released, but as it stands at the moment I feel there are relatively few maps.Lack of leaderboards Incredibly important for me as I like to play ""competitively"", be it world wide or with others in my country.All in all, I would recommend the game IF you aren't looking for the hardest maps, with quadstreams, jumptrills and songs with other patterns like these. The game is more aimed towards the casual VSRG player, so it failed to cater to me as it stands right now. ",118,10,7,12,24,1,2

								TL:DR: This game isn't worth $15. Free alternatives are Stepmania, FFR, and osu! mania (to an extent).Long answer:Out of curiosity I thought I would try this game to see how much it differs from other VSRGs. $15 is a bit steep for these types of games but I thought they might've done something interesting that would make it worth it. Here are some pros and cons I have with the game:*DISCLAIMER*: I will be comparing this game A LOT to Stepmania, another VSRG. The reason for this is that they are so similar to each other, it would be crazy not to compare the two.PROS:- The game seems to have a fairly professional feel and doesn't feel like it was made halfassed- The customizability in the settings for the game is extensive (feels VERY similar to stepmania)- Supports replays. This is especially good for this game because Stepmania, the game that is most similar to this game, does not have this feature at the moment- There is no prep work to get this game running with an assortment of mapsCONS For rhythm game enthusiasts:- If you are halfway decent at Stepmania, this game will be way too easy. I've gotten platinum scoring (99%) on practically all of the hardest difficulties with only one or two tries- The timing is way too basic. At this point, there are only two timing windows: you hit the note, or you missed it. There is no other timing windows e.g. in stepmania there is Marvelous, Perfect, Great, Good, Bad, Boo and Miss-  It's difficulty is based more on modifiers of the file rather than actual note density and patterns. Also a lot of the maps play like maps in Stepmania that are not supposed to be played with c-mod due to rapid bpm changesCONS for caual players:- It's just so expensive. 15 dollars for a game that could be played virtually the same and subjectively better for free is just not worth paying money forConclusion: This game would have been pretty good if it were the only option for this type of game genre. It's well-put together and has a good assortment of songs. Since this not the case, however, I cannot recommend it. There are other games that do this concept, in my opinion, better AND for free.

Early Access Review
								Lots of fun~! Would recommend! I did recieve this Pulsen game for free, as a gift from one of my friends on Steam. Harder than the original DDR! Pulsen offers more difficulty levels than the original DDR game. What's cool with some of the newer updates is that you can see the scoreboards of your past games and see your friends' scores, and you can save past games to challenge yourself to beat your past score. The only thing that is con that I've experienced so far is little bugs like the game crashing when START and SELECT are both selected at the same time during the ending scoreboard of a game. Another one is sometimes the songs don't sync the songs I've already played, so I don't see a score or earn points to unlock new songs. With that glitch, I just had to use ""cheat mode"" and just unlock all the songs so I could play them all without having to reinstall the same. What I would like to see in the future of Puslen is for them to add in a work out/gym/exercise mode where the game can count calories/burn fat, etc.			",94,24,1,4,21,2,13

								Sure it people compare it to stepmania, I have played both. Personally I prefer this the arrow maps are all carefully made and the music is good. They have recently released a path which is a vast improvement over the previous version. There are a lot of special effects like invisible notes random speed boosts and slow downs and frankly they made it pretty unfair. The recent path has got rid of a lot of this nonsense so now it is more pure and I guess a bit more like stepmania but better. Definitely recommend it :)			",326,56,27,30,22,5,36

Step to ThisI've owned Pulsen for some time now, but it is only recently I've been able to enjoy it the way I've always wanted to. With the addition of the Songs Don't End option and Workout Mode the game has become exactly what I needed. I'm an old DDR fan (34 years old as of this writing) who fell out of the habit as I got older and moved around. I've gained 60-70 pounds since then depending on when I weigh myself, and let me tell you, most of it is not muscle! :D I have a dad gut, and now that I'm getting older cholesterol is a real concern that I have to deal with. The best way is through regular exercise, not medication.The problem is, I've never exercised in my life unless someone was holding a proverbial gun to my head. I am former military and in that circumstance I could be fired for not exercising regularly, so I did. I never enjoyed it, though, and always did the bare minimum I could get away with. When I think about DDR, Stepmania, and now Pulsen, I don't think about exercise. I think about how much I love the music and how easy it is for me to get into the gameplay of stepping in time with the songs. It short circuits my innate aversion to taking good care of myself :PI'm going to start keeping an ""exercise"" log of all my sessions in Workout Mode detailing how many songs I did at what difficulties each day, and I do plan on making this a part of my daily routine. I work from home and have literally no excuse not to now that I have a fun activity that could add years to my life. I have a 3 year old now and I'd love to stick around for her as long as possible, and as far as I'm concerned the Pulsen team are saints for helping me do that in a way that is unique to this sort of game. They're filling a niche and doing a damn fine job of it. Bottom LineI know I sound dramatic, but I mean every word. I can't recommend this game highly enough for people who once loved DDR and wouldn't mind stepping up to the mat once again.Side NotesYes, you can download Stepmania and play a huge number of songs for absolutely free as many other reviewers have pointed out, but I don't feel like the Pulsen team is asking too much at $15 for around 100 original songs with at least 5x original step charts per song. The problem with Stepmania and any community project is that there is no quality control, the song charts you download might be good, or they might be awful, or they might not even be designed for human feet at all (keyboard play only). You don't know sometimes until you try them and that means wasted time. If you're an adult and realize how precious your time is, buying Pulsen is a good way to avoid a lot of hassle finding new quality music to step to. I'm not sure every song in Pulsen is completable on a mat at every setting, but every song is completable on at least some settings, and that is enough for me.			",590,93,4,119,46,6,105

								At the time of writing this review the game is still in early access, so everything is subject to change and update. After roughly 15 years of playing DDR & later moving on to ITG, I was excited to finally see a new take on 4 panel rhythm games. I actually owned this game before it was on steam around 2012. Sadly not much has changed since then. The skin the game is running over StepMania is pretty much the exact same as it was almost 4 years ago. The song selection is pretty decent at the time of writing this, fairly wide varity of genres. I didn't expect to see songs by Renard which was a nice surprise. The song unlock system is a good idea but at the end of the day, if you are a high skilled player at DDR or ITG, unlock songs feels more like a task than a reward. You get points after beating songs, you then use those points to choose what songs you wish to unlock. At the end of the day I had already unlocked every song with points in about 2 hours of play simply because the game is so easy. None of the songs really offer much of a challenge after playing song packs for SM like Pendulum or even some songs on ITG like Vertex or Hardcore of the North. Which I get it can't be to crazy as to allure to new players. But the fact I full combo every song without really trying is kind of sad. Probably the only thing that throws me off are the lifts. The are hugely annoying when playing on keyboard as I'm not holding down the panel after hitting a single note as I would while playing on a pad. All in all, this is a great rhythm game for what it is and I can only hope that it gets updates and support. Things like multiplayer online, marathons, higher difficulties and new songs.

								60+ songs spanning multiple genres. Tons of crazy options to choose from to make your playstyle unique. Multiple difficulty levels, and some really hard ones at that!Pulsen takes the best of previous Arrow Smash games and blends it into a really new experience. I play the harder charts since I'm a vet of the genre and I found myself thinking of many charts more like a puzzle rhythm game than just a simple dance game because of the holds, mines, and more. It's a welcome evolution of the genre and I can't wait for more songs to play in future DLC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Guys....  Never stop doing what you're doing.Let's get into this.I am probably THE MOST (arguable) hardcore rythm gamer out there.  I have definitely played it all with the exception of OSU because frankly, its just not viable without a certain peripheral like Guitar/DJ Hero.This game gets a lot of comparison to stepmania and rightfully so.  The Kicker:This game offers things that other indie games do not, Consistency.NOT ONCE have I felt I dropped a combo because of a misplaced, very random note.Not to mention that some of the challenge modes of the songs offer very unique twists such as;-Twisting notes-Skipping around the screen to the beat-Flipping the note gates around-Bending the path-and many more..Great game.  Only reason I even wrote a review was because just finished the challenge mode on Nyan Cat and felt compelled to.I will be pushing this to freinds and members of my community.Starting tonight you can view step setups on my stream.  twitch.tv/xbootlegx ",501,43,6,29,18,4,17

								I had found this game about a year ago, before it had come to Steam. There were more songs available at the time, but the game was essentially the same (I hear that there's going to be a bunch more songs added later anyway). If you like DDR, ITG, FFR, Sequence, or really any rhythm game, get Pulsen. It doesn't really break the mold of rhythm games (four directional arrows move towards markers that you need to hit pertaining to the song's beat), but it definitely does it well. The game runs really smoothly on my crappy laptop, and I haven't had any issues with calibration. With the limited song library, you may end up exhausting new content fairly quickly, but if you're a perfectionist or a high-score shooter, you can always try to beat your previous scores on higher difficulties. The songs themselves are generally catchy and entertaining, with the occassional stepfile that really throws you for a loop with interesting and challenging mods. There's a two-player option as well, if you feel like playing with a buddy.As this game is still technically in early access, I expect the developers will be adding many more songs and extra content in upcoming updates, so I expect to be playing this game off and on for quite some time.TL;DR:Pros:- Runs well on most hardware- Stepfile mods galore- Well-done DDR cloneCons:- Limited song choice- Only one game mode			",103,21,0,19,24,0,11

								For a genre of games that doesn't have many games represented on Steam, this is a quality rhythm game that is based off of DDR, ITG, and the like. Though it is built on Stepmania 5, it does plan to bring interesting features to the game as well as polish. In its current state, here is what the game offers:The Good:A decent selection of 53 songs, and it's bound to grow. (Hi Sta! I like Tone Sphere!)An unlock system that's rather unobtrustive and easy to breeze through. (You still have the option to skip through it entirely.)A good range of quality charts to choose from, from easy to difficult ones.Some charts have special effects thrown in to shake up gameplay if you find arrows simply scrolling up to the targets boring.Witty use of lift notes. (Even on a keyboard, I'm finding myself thrown off by them.)The timing windows feels spot on, so if you're feeling it to the music, you'll know how to hit the notes. It's also enough to provide a challenge to playing to the music.The Bad:53 songs is a good number of songs, but that burns through really quicly.There isn't a whole lot of variety of what kind of songs.At the moment, there isn't a lot of charts to showcase how crazy the charts get with speical effects.At its current state, the game isn't anything to be amazed about yet, especially compared to Stepmania 5. The game, however, is definitely showing signs of positive development, espcially with the developers actively responding to feedback from the community. The game is slated for many more features for a more unique and social experience to work with Steam. For rhythm gamers, the game is definitely worth a try.			",115,38,0,16,5,2,9

Early Access Review
								absolutey wonderful soundtrack and quality mapping thats fun to play both on pad and keyboard.all my major complaints about look have been fixed in the newest update, and i think now this is honestly the prettiest ddr like game out there, if there was community mapping/the option to import simfiles and edit maps i honestly dont see a reason to play stepmania over this, even with the price tag.aslo id like some extra hard unlockable boss songs in the future, that would be the icing on the cake to all this but thats just a personal opion			",134,19,3,15,13,1,9
