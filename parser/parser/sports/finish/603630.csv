								The kiddos and I really enjoy the puzzles, and the enjoyment we get from trying to figure them out. Simple and fun THANKS for a great free game!			",24,9,3,0,9,2,1

								Pretty straight forward game.  If you like making trick shots with rubber balls, you'll like this.			",56,28,3,2,11,2,1

								Pretty great, I would like an easy reset function to get the best possible spawn score, but I really enjoyed it.			",82,16,0,9,19,0,4

								A ""make the trick shot"" game. Nice minimal visual style. A great free game. Give it a shot!			",37,33,0,0,21,2,7

								Give this game a shot, but don't expect much from it in its current state. The poly count is super low, the graphics need a lot of polish, the controls need tweaking, and a lot more minor annoyances that rapidly add up to a negative review.I'll be happy to revisit this later once it's out of alpha and looking and feeling a lot more like a real game. For now, save your hard drive space.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
