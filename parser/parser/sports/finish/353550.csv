												Before I continue, I will mention this is a rough recommend. A low recommend, if you will. In The House of Caravan, you spend the game exploring a house, you have limited lighting, and must make use of matches to light things in the environment, and a flashlight with limited battery life (I only managed to find a couple of batteries during the game). You mostly go around, looking and collecting items for puzzles, and keys to unlock doors. It's a first-person adventure game where you freely walk around, and has some slight horror tones, though nothing particularly scary happens (there's two light jump scares and some strange audio cues at points, and the house starts shaking at random intervals, but nothing particularly spooky happens from it).The house is nicely designed, and is fun enough to explore. Some of the puzzles are a bit of fun, none are too hard and most are easily solved. There's some physics when you pick things up. Some of the music is nice. The story isn't bad, but there isn't anything remarkable about it either. Game is on kind of the short side, probably taking someone 90-120 minutes to complete it. There are optional documents laying around you can pick up which have voiced dialogue talking more about the background of the game.If you can get it for a cheap price and don't mind a sort of light adventure game, it's worth playing. There are much better game's than it in the same sort of genre, but for a cheaper price it's not a bad bet. There are a few niggles with it, I witnessed some frame drops, and a few glitches of me dropping something on the floor and it flinging me into the air a bit, but nothing too bad and some light polish could easily fix this. Some audio volume elements were also a little low in my opinion.If you want to explore a house with some light puzzles in it, then it's decent. If not your cup of tea, you won't be missing anything amazing by skipping out on it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An ok indie walking/drawer opening simulator which can be completed with 100% achievements in under 2 hours. Buy it on a sale, otherwise looks too expensive for what it offers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Story begins in mansion, where you woke up in a room on the floor. You remember, that you were captured by man, on your way from school. It's a first-person adventure game. This game is just about exploring house and rooms. Yes, there are some puzzles but they are not that too hard. You can have flashlight (it's limited but you can find batteries in house). Then there we have matches, which can light candles in rooms. Be careful and open each cabinet because you can find parts of the puzzles (photos, books). The game has a terrifying sounds (opening cabinets is quite scary) but it's not a horror game. However, there are some scary moments (something falls on the ground). House is really cozy. Thanks to fireplaces, photos and paintings of family you feels like at home. The story isn't bad but there is always something that could be even better. Voices are seriously perfect. I always listened to reading of letters till the end. Playing time is really short. I don't know why but House of Caravan is really similar to game ""Amnesia"". Glitch here and glitch there. Game has a lot of glitches. Things often get stuck in walls, tables, floors. Even happened to me that I was standing in a drawer and i have seen floor over me.+ graphics+ scary sounds+ easy puzzles+ voices- glitches- playing time			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												House of Caravan is a perfect example of games being more than a simple gameplay. You won't run from monsters, track down a serial killer or lose your sanity, but you will become immersed in a surprisingly very well-written drama with great visuals (maybe a bit too dark but still great).Of course there is a lack of action in this game, but being immersed in such deep way to the story being told, I didn’t missed it at all. I had fun playing this the game, specially the end part that comes with the credits as the voiceover made me understand some things I missed at first, and left me wanting to know more about the Caravan’s universe, when we will see House of Caravan 2?

												This is a two hour long jaunt around a 13-room, 4-bath family house in search of answers and keys. It sports three 'vexing' puzzle types: a complete-the-circuit, a piece-the-torn-up-note-back-together, and a find-the-secret-code-in-the-old-photograph; each of which is repeated once making up a grand total of six puzzles. Scattered throughout the house are ham-fisted 'letters' revealing the whos, wheres, and whys of your predicament, read out in the most tone-deaf manner imaginable. The house itself is beautiful, if a little dark, and full of the most useless items to briefly pickup and break or to simply trip over and shoot right into the roof. Though indistinguishable from any other, some items are very useful, most of them being keys to the various locked rooms. Boxes of matches and batteries for your flashlight can also be found, implying there would be anything but mild annoyance waiting for you should you fail to ration these resources. If there was some looming specter in the shadows, I certainly never found it.House of Caravan isn't bad game, it just never got around to being a good one. It has the amateurish feel of a B-horror movie and even a little of that genre's charm. If you're willing to stumble around a bit and manage to find the game for less than 50 cents, it might even be worth your time... but just barely.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A pretty short game, but well worth the $6. Not really horror, but an atmospheric, creepy game much more like ""Gone Home"". The puzzles are pretty strightforward, there were one or two that had me scratching my head, but all in all a good game. My only real complaints are that it could use a bit more optimization, and some of the physics on the items are a bit wonky. Recommended!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

House of Caravan is a first-person adventure game. You were kidnapped and taken to a mansion. To find a way out of the mansion, you'll need to explore all the rooms, gather items and solve puzzles. This is a very basic game of mystery, exploration and puzzling: the mystery is nothing special but like all adventure game mysteries it beckons to be solved nonetheless you'll either find a way into the next room or find two or three keys to other rooms so the game is not completely linear but it comes close there are only 6 puzzles and they are not hard at allMost of the negative reviews do have a point. It would have been better if the character's walking speed was a bit higher. If you want the Steam Achievements for collecting all the items and all the letters that tell the story, you will open an afwul lot of drawers. There are only 3 types of puzzles, each of which you'll encounter twice, and experienced puzzlers won't find them challenging at all.But it's not all bad. House of Caravan has decent graphics for an indie game. The voice acting isn't half bad, especially for an indie game. The game manages to create a spooky atmosphere that piques one's interest to see what you will find in the mansion and how the game will end. You have to take House of Caravan for what it is. A short indie adventure game that has you exploring a mansion while you learn why you're there. It's one of those games you should never pick up unless it's heavily discounted (at least -80%), even if the genre appeals to you. I bought House of Caravan for 19 cents and for that I got two hours of adventuring through a spooky mansion, so I'm content. And from that perspective I do recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												House of Caravan is a first person exploration game that drops you in the middle of a mystery with the intention of trying to escape. The question becomes, will you escape, or are you trapped forever? This first person exploration game has a few puzzles and lot of things to explore. You start in a house and must explore the house to figure out why you are there and the mystery surrounding your circumstances. Honestly there are few bugs in the game that I noticed. Occasionally my character would 'jump' if I did something weird like opened a drawer and looked up in some weird fashion, but overall, the game was a very smooth experience that I didn't expect at all. Seeing as the game has been bundled, I was not expecting such a nice experience. Sound: The background music is rather appropriate and ominous which makes sense as you're trying to figure things out and you're not quite sure how bad things will get. The individual sound assets seemed very fitting and I never questioned them. Your character will respond to certain prompts with one phrase over and over again, which gets mildly irritating as there is no variation, but it's completely ignorable. One thing I really enjoyed was the voice acting for certain things. I could take a break during certain segments and listen to it while I took care of some small task at my desk. Graphics: A lot of time was put into making a full experience here. While the graphics may not be the best in the world, I can definitely say that they tried their best to make a complete experience. For the price tag, I have zero issues with them. Kudos to the dev. Story: The story is rather well put together. You discover bits of it as you explore and it's rather well done. A few bits could be a little more fluid, but really no complaints at all. It was rather enjoyable to find out what had happened and why between solving mysteries and puzzles. Controls: Zero complaints. Though I would have liked a bit faster running speed, it's really nothing to stress about. Everything pretty much makes sense and works. The rotation speed of objects is a little slow, but I don't really know why you'd care, unless you want to inspect everything up close and see it from every angle. Personally wasn't a factor for me. Overall: 6.9/10 - Honestly the game is very good for what it is. Even though the game has been bundled in the past, I don't see any reason not to spend $5 on it. I think the developers did a great job on this game and deserve support. It's a cohesive gaming experience that immerses you into the world of the protagonist and challenges you with some fun puzzles in between your explorations. A very nice experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a fun mystery and puzzle game. The atmosphere reminded me of Amnesia, but it's definitely not a horror game. It is shorter than I would have liked, but for the price it's not bad at all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had a good time with this one. The story is a weird one told through text on-screen but it's done in a way that's easier to understand then some of these FP adventures. I did find it at time a little difficult to work out where I was meant to be going, especially at one point towards the end and there still seems to be no clues. I just ended up getting lucky. The game looks good but again fairly short.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
