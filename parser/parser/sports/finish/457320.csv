												Upon entering the game the first impression I got was a tron vibe. The graphics are simplistic and colorful but have a sharp design style.The opening lobby is an empty room that contains a number of pedestals with different difficultly levels on each one. initially, the only selectable difficulties are Zen (practice mode) and easy.I started off with easy mode.The ball is tee'd up for you to hit and the controls are simple. You swing at the ball and, depending on how hard and what angle you hit it at, it will direct your shot. You want to aim at the sweetspot (outside edges) or angle your shot to bounce off of one or multiple walls. The object, just like pong, is to outwit and outshoot your AI opponent looking to return your serve.Also, it is good to note there is a leaderboard which I think is a staple and necessary in any arcade type game. It's just another carrot on a stick to keep users striving to do better and encourages players to continue coming back to the game. In the current iteration the leaderboard is only visible once you enter the room. My suggestion is having a way to bring up the leaderboard without having to leave the game and come back.After some witty quips from my computer opponent I took my shot. WHAM, ACE +100 points. First impressions are great, the accuracy relies completely on the user ability to control the motion controls and the speed in which the shot is taken.The AI opponent is comical with its retorts and it motivates me to hit my shots correctly.There are 5 rounds and the player has to reach 5 points in any game, before the AI, to move onto the next round.I did well and made my way through easy without too much difficulty and was very amazed at how much fun it is to play. I quickly restarted easy to get a better position on the leaderboard.After getting my bearings I moved onto medium difficulty.My first impression was that the room increased in size. Ok, that's a cool idea and mechanic.Quickly, I realized my 7 ft tall ceilings were not going to suffice for any difficulty past easy.I tried my best to not crush my ceilings, but unfortunately a number of shots went above my reach and it happened regardless.I made my way through Medium with some lackluster results after restarting a couple times and having learned to let some shots just go by to save my drop-tile ceilings.I moved onto hard and the room grew bigger. After the first return, I had to leave as a lot of the shots were above my head.After trying out Zen difficulty I found an equal amount of fun to be had in this very different racquetball type style training simulator.I did not notice any bugs in the initial testing I've done but will continue to check out the game and see if I find any in time.So, after an hour of testing I think this game has a ton of potential. The controls are very intuitive and the gameplay is inviting and fun. The difficulty ramps up fairly but my main complaint is that you would probably need at least 9' ceilings in the games current iteration if you are a tall individual like me at 6'3"".

												I'm a casual racquet ball/tennis player, and after the update this game is now better than ever.Before the update, this was a great game.  The core game was solid, but my only gripe was that each shot felt more like a ricochet rather than an actual swing. When I would serve the ball with all my might, sometimes it'd be a cannon, and sometimes it'd be a dud. You'd get a lucky defensive shot ricochet with power into the AI's sweet spot. You really just had to make contact to stay competitive with expert AI.Since the update, ALL these problems have been resolved.  EVERY Time I serve, it zooms across the court like I intended.  Also, those fast serves get a FAST return volley.  If you serve with power, be prepared to react within a split second. Now my defensive shots are slow and easy for the AI to pick up. Against harder AI, you truly have to earn each point and smash the ball into their sweet spot.It also now gives you a warning to use your wrist straps and perhaps replace your Vive straps with Wii straps. I am a victim of Vive straps breaking off, causing the controller to fly into the wall.  You do not want a $110 repair bill from HTC support. Trust me.Great game: A must buy for racquet ball, tennis, squash players, or anyone with a mild interest in racquet sports really.			",135,48,4,8,26,5,4

												Disclaimer: I was provided a beta key by the developers prior to release.HoloBall is a mix between Pong and racquetball, stylized with Tron-like art animations. The gameplay is simple: score against an AI by hitting the ball with one of your paddles. The game's difficulty ramps up as it continues and each round introduces a modifier such as speeding up the AI or increasing hit power.Leaderboards encourage replayability and I'd love to see online multiplayer in the future. One thing to note is that you'll be swinging your controllers pretty hard. Make sure you have adequate play space and are aware of your position in your room. I'd personally like to see an outline of the play space much like Space Pirate Trainer to increase positional awareness. (Update: The developer has since added this along with other suggestions sent pre-release. Excellent turn around!) My play space is about 3.3m x 2.8m and I didn't have any issues beyond being overly cautious.HoloBall takes a classic game into the world of VR and executes on this idea well. This is well worth the cost of admission, especially once you consider the launch sale.			",207,55,7,24,36,4,38

												HOLOlujah! This game is BALLer!Imagine if the original 1974 Pong, had a baby with a colorful, virtual 3-Dimensional environment. Then, that child grew up, and had a baby with the classic indoor sport of racquetball. That wonderful, miracle, of a baby, is named; HoloBall!HoloBall is a competitive sport-like game in which takes place in what appears to be a neon version of a racquetball court. The goal is to win against a snarky, sarcastic, comedic AI, and attempting to get the highscore to get your name up on the leaderboard. Doing so, immenses a challenge and a great amount of fun! The different difficulty levels, really help to match your level of skill. The harder the difficulty, the larger the court and the smaller the ball. The racket has perfect physics! It feels all so very natural swinging at the ball attempting to get it passed the AI. Not only is this game a large amount of fun, its a great workout too if you really get into it! I highly recommend purchasing this game for anyone who even has a slight interest in; Racquetball, Tennis, or even the original Pong.Warning: DON'T LET GO OF YOUR CONTROLLER!

												Disclaimer: I received free a key on Reddit from the developersHoloBall is a great little mashup of racket-ball and pong, mixed with the post-apocalyptic robot humor that reminds me a bit of GladOS from Portal. Absolutely worth the price of admission!Good:Very fun to play, easy to pick up and hard to master (I can't make it beyond the Hard difficulty). I love this visual style, reminicent of the old Tron movie mixed with some polygon backgrounds from the old Virtual Boy era. Sense is scale is really nice, feels like you are in a big hall/hangar. One thing I absolutely loved was the haptic feedback of the racket. It has this long veil/ribbon streaming out of the back and as you move it, you feel it swoosh around. Really sold me on having that sci-fi racket in my hand instead of the Vive controller.Bad:A bit barebones with regards to gameplay modes and options, but the base game has enough to offer initially. Future updates should include more modes (many balls come toward you, specific areas of the court give more points/are blocked, etc) and possibly power-ups (more balls, racket size changes etc). Multiplayer would also be very cool but it would require big changes to the gameplay (can't go as high vertically). One final note of warning: make sure you have a lot of space or stand as far back as you can! I have about 2.8x2.3m and was so immersed and focused on winning and smashing the ball that I scratched the controller on the wall twice in a row the first time I played it. I had no problems being aware of the bounds and not hitting them with any of my other games, so be warned!			",128,47,4,5,25,4,5

												This game is extremely fun, challenging and gets you moving. Many people compare it to CyberPong and, having played its demo, I can honestly say that this game is better. The main problem with CyberPong, compared to this, is that here the ball actually responds to how quickly you hit it. In CyberPong, the ball goes at the same speed most of the time. In multiplayer, it just speeds up over the course of the point, but gently tapping it has the same result as hitting it with force. Here, you can feel the momentum of your bat/racket/thing getting transferred to the ball. The ball even curves if you hit it right. There is also a subtle vibration as you move your controller, making it feel as though you are actually holding a lightsaber! The music is fantastic and fits very well into the theme of the game, and the visuals make you feel as though you stepped into Tron: Legacy. This is further augmented by what the AI (your opponent) says: things like ""next human please"" if you lose and ""this may be a quirk of the reality we graced you with"" if you score a point. Kinda reminds me of GLaDOS, honestly.To conclude, this game is super fun to play (it kinda feels like a workout after longer sessions) and its atmosphere is spot on. I can't wait for things like multiplayer to be added (which IS listed in the Coming Soon section in the description, which is nice).If this review sounded like an essay, I'm sorry, it's the middle of Exam Week.

												Of all the early VR experiences out there, I keep coming back to this one. I'm not particularly masterful at any sport (real or otherwise), but this feels well-balanced. I am currently just about beating the computer on Medium every time and now am ready to try Hard. I've found myself gloating at the AI player after a nailing particularly good serve or offhand smash (which includes pointing my right-hand paddle at it and saying ""HA F**K YOU LOSER!"") and the feeling of personal shame when you fluff a particularly simple shot still gets me. Some quick tips: - Be mindful of where BOTH paddles are. A couple of times I've tried a backhand and my off-hand has gotten in the way and rebounded the ball back through my own goal. - You can tee up the ball on the serve before smashing it. Makes nailing Aces much more likely (my best is 4 in a row). I can foresee that, with practice, I could start to Roddick the crap out of this and hit them every time). - Low returns are a ♥♥♥♥♥. Be prepared to get down low and deflect them back defensively. - Don't be afraid of your weaker hand - you might actually find that your % success rate is better as you'll hit so many more across to the other side of the goal and the AI might not make it in time.I'm looking forward to seeing where this games goes. Oh and the setting just works. Get ready for a Blood-Dragon-Pong-Tron-Athon.10/10 would swear at my dining room wall again.			",70,14,1,2,7,1,16

												If Holopoint is the game that will make you hate the Vive's breakout box, Holoball is the game that will make you hate its wrist straps. I personally haven't had any experiences with anyone letting go of the controller yet, but I've seen plenty of evidence elsewhere, and it's a bit telling that Nintendo has suddenly sold out of every color of wrist strap except the basic white, so if you don't always keep a good grip or know someone who might not be too careful then you might want to get a beefier wrist strap before you play this one. As for the game itself, it's simple but fun, like most of the cheaper Vive games I've played. It's sort of like pong mixed with tennis, in which you play against an AI. If you've got a spectator they can also take over the AI and play with WASD, but in my experience they won't stand a chance and it's better to just leave it to the computer. There are four difficulties that you unlock as you complete the previous one, and it can be a pretty good workout on the later difficulties. It's not necessarily the sort of thing that's super impressive on a technological level, but for the price it offers a fair amount of entertainment unless you manage to break your wrist strap, in which case the only people being entertained may be the TV repair company.

												Update - The devs have added more music so yay! It sounds good, too. Great game. Good fun, very satisfying, and you'll never have to go to the gym again. The game is definitely a workout. The only thing I don't like about it right now is that there's only one music track. Maybe the developer will add some more, but it's not bad as it is. But BE CAREFUL. I had someone try it out and while playing, the wrist strap on the controller SNAPPED OFF and he lost his grip and the controller flew into the wall and stopped working. Thanks to a guide I found online I was able to fix it by opening it up and reconnecting a strip, but it's much better to not have your controllers break at all. So hold those controllers tight when you're playing this game! I would even recommend putting something different on for a wrist strap. I use the ones from the Wii controllers now.

												If you were born in the 80s, this app will speak to you in a way younger generations can only interpret from their poor cliches and rudimentary tropes.Mechanically the game play is very straightforward. Your goal is to get the HoloBall to the opposing side of the wireframe, tetrahedron court, whilst preventing your opponent from achieving the same.Stylistically the design is spot on. A very clean and pure 80's digital distopia, which will remind many of you of the iconic ""Tron"" films.The music sets the tone perfectly and compliments the aesthetic too a tee.Occasionally it feels as if the collider for the paddle is not keeping up with the update cycle. This could be a problem with the Physics Engines update period, (I'd be interested to know if they've got it set at 90FPS). Alternatively I could be getting old and decrepit.The HoloBall will occasionally ignore that my paddle is inside it's spawn box, which frequently results in own goals whilst I gloat over my perfect serve. This is irritating and unless a real♥♥♥♥♥♥up has occured during development, should be a very simple fix.The obvious feature request would be multiplayer, pvp and co-op would be great fun.Alternatively someone else will probably create a knock off on this idea and implement the above...Who knows, my weekend is pretty clear!All in all, great game, lots of fun, decent work out.

												I was lucky enough to get an early access copy of the game on reddit. So while I played a paid copy of the game, I won't let this influence this review.As someone enjoying sports involving rackets like Tennis or Badminton, I feel like this game is absolutely fantastic fun! Let's start with the concept. You hit a ball with a racket, either with your left or right hand, and watch as it travels towards a huge wall covered by a floating AI opponent platform. Said CPU tries to return the ball and the goal of course is to get the ball past the player. It's basically pong meeting squash. There are three alternate modes: „Zen“ is classic squash, with the player having to repeatedly hit the ball of a wall. Then there are three different difficulties for matches against an AI, each consisting of five games, first to score five wins a game. Players are rewarded points for winning and performing bonus actions like an ace serve, but get points substracted for time spent. In this highscore-based mode it's all about time basically. To round the content of, „Endurance“ has you playing against a bot with only three lives to survive. Fundamentally, you have to score as many points as possible without letting the ball get past you more than two times. While each mode contains more or less the same key gameplay elements, they still all play diverse. Zen is best played rather slow, as you want the ball to travel as slow as possible to be able to return it as precise as possible over and over again. On the three difficulty enemy encounters, I tend to play more and more aggressively. While „Easy“ really is quite easy, „Medium“ already managed to give me a workout. „Hard“ definitely is a challenge and I tend to absolutely smash the ball whenever possible to get past the enemy. Spanning five rounds each, the AI gets better with the rounds played. It moves faster or returns the ball harder, giving you a great progressive increase of difficulty even within the different modes. „Endurance“ also comes with a change-up in mechanics. While the three other enemy modes have a „sweetspot“ zone on the edges of the wall that you'll definitely want to hit, leaving the enemy no chance to reach it, this zone doesn't exist in Endurance. All my play in the three difficulty modes usually focusses on aiming at the sweetspot-zones, making it feel different to Endurance. Here, you need to out-play the enemy, once again involving forceful smashes and quick directional changes. All of the playing modes ultimately have you hitting the ball, but while incorporating the same mechanics, they still manage to feel different due to varied circumstances.The actual gameplay is absolutely mad fun! The Vive controller just works awesome as a racket. I'm playing in a 3,8m x 1,8m space and the use of room scaling is fantastic. It can be quite exhausting running from one end to the other, though it never seemed unfair in my time with it. When the ball came through, I always knew I was too slow. All in all it feels like a work out, but a very fun one. As hard as I kept hitting the balls, I felt sore muscles just few hours later the first time I played it. The game encourages me to use both arms, as each hand is equipped with a racket. While you theoretically still can play with one controller using forehand and backhand hits, you're way better off using both. I'm usually terrible at doing anything with my non-dominant arm and as the game encourages me to still use it, I think it actually helps me getting better with it. At the start I couldn't hit a ball with it, but it has already gotten better at the end of my first session and it keeps improving. Haptic feedback on the controllers makes the swinging all the more satisfying.One of the most fun experiences I've had in VR with the Vive so far has been jump-smashing a ball to victory. It feels so satisfying to run and jump, smashing the ball with as much force as possible. It makes me feel really bad♥♥♥♥♥ especially if it's still precisely aimed at a sweetspot zone. The game becomes a frantic, awesome work out on both the Hard difficulty and Endurance, as the enemy tends to return the ball harder and harder. My reflexes are greatly tested as the ball can come back in any direction in my 3,8m playspace width. Smash the ball and you face quite a workout with the enemy giving you a real challenge.With all the talk about smashing a controller around, I didn't come close to hitting any furniture or walls in my time with the game so far. There's a room requirement for a reason, and I think as long as you have the required 1.5m x 2m or greater, you're good to go. The room scale use seems perfect and thanks to Chaperone, I'm sure there won't be a case of destroyed furniture or controller :p I ended up hitting myself with the controllers though which is a first for me with the Vive. The heavy hitting makes it difficult to slow the controllers down in time in some occasions and thus I hit myself regularly in my first hour. The more I played though, the less this happened. But a short, important advice: It seems crucial to wear the controller wrist straps. All the smashing in combination with slippery hands can make controllers fly through the room. I actually had a controller slip happen to me, while wearing the straps though – thankfully. So remember to use them or you'll regret it.Visually, the game is looking great. The neon colors are vibrant, though the black largely black background keeps it light on the eyes. The controller rackets feature some cool visual effects, but I would suggest not to hold them directly in front of your eyes – they are very bright. The visuals give me a Tron-esque vibe and it feels great. The sense of space is fantastic! Depending on the game mode and difficulty, you play in a smaller or larger hall. Especially the large one really impresses with the threedimensional portrayal and with the ball traveling longer than in the small room, it's part of the reason why this game feels very immersive. I tend to forget that I'm wearing the Vive and that is always a good sign! The CPU is trash-talking to you during play which is fun, even though its lines become repetitive after some matches.With the most important aspects out of the way, there are some miscellaneous things I want to talk about. The menus are fantastic, very intuitive. All the modes are right in front of you (though you have to unlock some by completing the previous ones first) and you choose a mode by putting the controller into the respective icon. On top of that, the game has super quick loading times which always is a great plus in my book. I'd appreciate another way to access the leaderboards. Currently, you can see it before starting a new match. As an arcade game pretty much revolving around highscores, I would appreciate a simpler way of having a quick look at the leaderboard. Also, I tend to press the Vive home button when things get heated so I'd wish for an option to disable all button presses while playing. Nitpicking though :) The game feels very polished and I've yet to face any kind of bug.Just a short disclaimer: All of my experience is based on the build that I played on the weekend before official release. I didn’t see any patch provided so I assume the final version is the exact same as I played. As polished as it is, there’s no real need for a patch anyway. Holoball is a very fun experience and I can see myself playing this every day for some small workout. Three modes with increasing difficulties play more diverse than I thought and chasing highscores quickly got me hooked. The price of 10 bucks is great and if you can imagine yourself having at least a tiny bit of fun equipped with two rackets, smashing every ball the AI is testing you with, I can fully recommend the game to you. If you don't mind a little workout, you're in for an insanely fun game that has you jump-smashing ball for ball like a badass!			",305,115,12,29,42,4,19

												BETA REVIEW:Pros:    The art style is really awesome in VR. It's minimalistic and it really works well in the Vive.    The music fits very well with the game.    The gameplay is really solid. Pong but in VR. Hitting the ball is easy, no strange mechanics (That I've noticed atleast).    Global leaderboardsCons:    Not many gamemodes or anything more to it. If you don't want what's in the trailer, don't buy it.I really enjoy this game so far. I think this will be a great demo game because it is SUPER easy to understand and anyone should be able to play it.(Played with HTC Vive, 2 Controllers, Roomscale - 2.1m x 1.8m)			",667,181,29,68,87,13,88

												This is way more fun than I thought it was going to be, seriously. Depending on how much space you have in your living room setup for VR it might make you chase a ball here or there. I thought I would be standing in one spot, but with room scale that is not the case. I either suck or I'm really bad at this game but on my first try the game bested me on easy. Awesome 80s feel, simple, and a ton of fun.This is one of those must have's for the HTC VIVE. ",154,25,6,11,12,1,24

I always come back to this game to play a few rounds every night. I think this is a must-have game for every Vive owner. Also, I recommend replacing your Vive controller wrist-straps with something better, such as the wii-controller-straps, before you find out the hard way how easy the default ones break.

												This is the first game I played where the wrist straps on the controllers became a necessity. The fact that I got into it enough to put in the effort that this was an issue is, to me, a sign of high praise. It's enough of a workout (to my slightly overweight, sedentary self) to test the sweat-absorbing capabilities of the face pad, too. And at the same time, fun enough to play a few rounds to work up that sweat, making it a more consistent ""exercise"" option than, you know, actual exercise. It's not like it's complex, or especially deep gameplay, but it doesn't need to be. It gets you moving in a fun way. And since that makes it WAY cheaper than a treadmill, that all adds up to a recommendation.			",173,45,5,23,89,4,43

												15 minutes of play time on Easy and I started breaking a sweat.  This game is crazy fun.  AI sometimes feels a little off (will miss some shots it feels like it should have easily matched with, and hits some crazy ricochets outside of human reasoning), but having it taunt you more than makes up for it.Unfortunatly (and the devs state this is a fix / work in progress) is the play area boundries you have can make the difficulty a bit weird.  If you have a wide space, the AI could realistically hit a corner before you can reach it.  Too small, and the AI will keep punting balls straight into your paddles.Overall a great experience.  I can only imagine how crazy the later difficulties bring. ",302,78,0,57,22,1,26

												A solid VR title with a variety of difficulties. It's excellent exercise, so expect to work up a sweat! This is always one of the games I show people when I demo my Vive. You absolutely should NOT play this with the default safety straps, as the plastic bit that the two small strings go WILL give out with the slightest amount of effort. The strings themselves are fine, but they are attached to the plastic by a small amount of weak glue. I recommend buying Wii mote straps from Nintendo before trying this game. You may think you can hold on to your controllers, but as your hands get sweaty do you really want to risk them? Straps are $3, controllers are like $100-150 each.			",233,33,2,16,27,1,28

												Okay, this was a total suprise game for me.Very, very simple, harkening to Pong.But you have two paddles. and have to move in the space against a more and more difficult foe: Who will cheat, mid you, becomming bigger and faster at the game goes on.I sorta rolled my eyes when playing it on easy, but yeah, Medium starts to work up sweat. Still stuck on the final round on it, but then again it just might be my arm getting sore from swinging so much as you have to make the ball move fast inorder to avoid a time penalty to score.Downside is that when ever my frames dip slightly so that , it seems like the collission detection goes off. With graphics like these its odd that it is lagging quite a bit on a minspec ""VR Capable"" computer (equilevant to 970). Hopefully they can work out some optimization in. Could also use some more old school synth music too.But otherwise, for its price, it is a steal!			",288,60,11,29,37,1,54

												Quick First Impression review since I started this up after midnight and I don't want to disturb any neighbors.I started the thing up and the first thing that stuck out to me is: WTF is that robot dude saying?  His voice is the worst thing ever.  Imagine some guy making his voice sound unnaturally deep and then standing behind an electric fan and talking and you'll be on the right track.  If you're going to make a robot voice make it intelligible.  Or just make R2D2 sounds and give me subtitles... So anyway, the 2nd thing that struck me was ""Wow, this is a big ♥♥♥♥ing room!"" and it was... like far bigger than the room I was playing it in... I started to worry that I was going to run into walls.  I tried not to run...This is a game where you will want to run though.  Keep that in mind.So those things aside, what is this game?  Think ""VR pong"".  It's like all my old 70's and 80's arcade buddies came back in VR form!  So  yeah, you get a big ole paddle  (One in each hand actually) and a multifaceted VR Ball appears in front of you... swing your paddle and the ball flies towards the big red square that represents your robot AI enemy.  He makes sure his large red square hits the ball and it flies back toward you.   You will likely wind up having to dash a bit to get to the ball in time and thus you start to annoy anyone downstairs. At first the only two modes available to you are Zen (where you're just whacking the ball against the wall) and Easy... and I assume to unlock the harder modes you have to beat the easier modes.  Fair enough.  I wouldn't want to challenge the game on hard without proving I'm not going to have a heart attack on medium first anyway.There isn't a whole lot else to this game (or so it seems).  There was a customize option but I have no idea what options are available to customize.  Maybe paddle size? ball size?  Some kind of documentation would be nice...maybe there is some and I just didn't see it.  It's certainly not in-game though.Anyway... VR Pong, guys... this is pretty much what you can expect.  It feels a lot like you're playing squash or tennis (minus the net).  I think they could do better with this game if they added some stuff to it though... Maybe change the gravity or add some better sound effects... As it is now, it'll be a good workout (so many games this applies to) but whether that translates to fun or not has yet to be seen.I'll update this review when I've had more time with it.  For now it gets a tentative thumbs up because it seems to have potential.			",844,225,54,90,158,17,114

												This game is so close to being perfect.  For the first hour, I was in love with this game.  It was after the first hour that the issues began to arise.  The first is that the AI shoots the ball right on the edge of the play space.  Now, they do have a way to add padding to your play space to keep you from hitting walls, and that's a great thing to have, but when the AI is consistently throwing shots that make you fearful of hitting a wall (I hit a picture frame and smashed the glass) it stops being fun.  Tweaking the AI to keep it from throwing so many shots on the play space line would go a long way.The other issue is the physics of the ball.  They're just not right.  Hit the ball to the left, and it curves to the right.  It does all these weird curves that make absolutely no sense and make it difficult to have any sort of strategy.  Why try to hit the ball in one direction when it's just going to fly off in the direction it wants to anyway?  That might have to do with the way the paddles are angled in relation to the controllers.  You can't hold the controllers normally and have the paddles be at a normal angle.  It's odd.  Allowing the user to modify the angle of the paddles would be nice.Overall, fun game.  But if you have a small play area or are looking for a paddle ball game where you can actually control the direction of the ball, look elsewhere.  Though I'm recommending it, I do so with reservations.Yeah, I had to change my rating after continuing the play.  I just can't recommend this game. The AI is atrocious and the physics governing the ball cause one hit straight on to curve off to the side or even go behind you, which makes this game just too frustrating to bother with.

												I did not care for this one at all.  The play area increases through advancement but found that it would have the ball coming in too deep to the sides outside the chaperone area.  This basically invites you to swing outside the chaperone area which can be bad news.Also, the play was pretty dry.  I don't see why people are throwing controllers out of hands as how hard you swing does not play in how the ball behaves.  Not enough options for play just hit the ball against the wall.At least it is not steeply priced.  But it is not my cup of tea at all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The most basic aspect of the game, hitting a ball with a paddle, is extremely inconsistent if you're swinging the paddle. The game mechanics encourage and require that you swing at the ball, but then respond with chaotic behavior, such as being reflecting perpendicular to where it makes sense for the ball to go (leading to a dead ball penalty), or backwards into your own goal.

												This game needs some major work, the developer(s) have little to no understanding of physics or game mechanics. The ball is often going fast enough to teleport through your paddle which often lags behind your hand for no reason. My favorite part is when the ball is out of your bounds by more than a foot.

												I really tried to like this game. Although simple, the graphics work and the game in general is polished. However, every single time I play the game I have the feeling that the hit detection if off for some reason.  More than once I find myself losing track of the ball after I'm positive a should have struck the ball well. For me this game was most of the time a frustration. Maybe I suck at it, but most other tennis/table tennis/squash-like games I've played didn't feel as frustrating. I'm going to refund and play Racket: Nx, which I highly recommend.

												Looked fun. Wasn\'t.The feedback for striking a hit is pretty unnoticeable, if it\'s there at all, leaving you to wonder if you hit the ball if you weren\'t looking directly at it. The color choice also hinders this issue since the paddles, paddle trails, and the ball all are the same exact color. This results in very unsatisfying and hard to visually parse gameplay.The audio mixing is unbearable. The music comes across like static most of the time and overpowers all other audio ques and dialogue. If there\'s an option to adjust this in the settings I couldn\'t say because......The menus are completely unusable. They appear outside the place space, meaning you can\'t physically get to them to touch. There seems to be no other means of interacting with them resulting in you stuck but to quit to home after every match.			",178,40,7,20,9,6,4

It's simple to learn but tough to master, matches are quick but it's got that ""one more round"" appeal (having achievements to work towards definitely helps), all the smashing and lunging is great exercise, and you can rock out to the awesome soundtrack. The paddles can feel a little ""too precise"", in the sense that the Vive controllers don't have the weight to smooth out your movements the way a real paddle would, but that's really my only gripe.

												This is the game that will break your steam controller, maybe your bones, but you can't stop playing.Make sure you get Wii strap so your controller last longer.The AI is ridiculously strong but I like it, although some rookie level tutorial maybe better.I'm OK with the graphics but I may prefer a better leadboard.

												Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥The tracking is great. The visuals are great. The difficulty scaling as you progress through the game is FANTASTIC. By the end of the game it gives you the same feeling of facing the last members of the Elite 4: That focus, that assclenching, that sweat that trickles down your back and into your buttcrack. The tension is THERE and always present as you climb through the levels and defeat that stupid red square.Buy this game for a free workout, both mental and physical.			",95,8,10,7,11,2,12

												the go-to game for my partner, she loves it. Definitely the most physical game on the Vive and legendary for the amount of controller vs environment damage it's caused. Replace the default controller straps, make sure you have a good sized area with no solid walls in reach and be prepared to pull the cords out of the link box more than once.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Holoball is a very simple and satisfying VR experience. Anyone who has ever played tennis or raquetball will be able to pick this up without any explanation. The environment is colorful, immersive, and extremely 80's. Playing gives me a sense of nostalgia, because it is everything people thought VR would be like three decades ago. You will work up a sweat in the higher difficulties, and may need to 'air-out' your HMD every few minutes.At $10, this is a great price-point for Holoball. The music is great, and the gameplay is surprisingly responsive for the speed of the game. It is a great game to demo for those new to VR. The only improvement I can think to make is updating the voice of the robot overlord narrator. Although the banter is funny, it is just a little hard to hear.			",177,73,3,18,19,4,13

												This game quickly became my favourite vive game, after trying loads of different games.  It reminds me of the sport ""Squash"".  And as a casual badminton player i found this game to my liking.My first thought before buying this game was the feeling that it had similarities to Air Hockey. Which i absolutely love. The difference here is that you're not playing on a flat table but in a three dimensional room. You can make cool ricochet shots or try to smash a straight, well placed shot.The game has a multiplayer element where one steers the ""ai"" with the keyboard. I tired it for a few seconds while demoing it to a friend. but it was to hard to hit the ball when controlling the ai which made it very easy for the player.The music is fantastic, filled with energy. I read reviews of there being only one song, but that must have been updated. As of now i think there is atleast three songs that i know of.The game is well worth the money. It provides alot of fun and a great workout			",154,30,2,9,14,1,4

												The game is lots of fun and similar to Holopoint makes you move a lot, especially in the high difficulties.As a long time tennis player I enjoyed hitting the ball and seeing that there is at least some kind of spin mechanic.However, this might just be me, but I feel like pretty often the hitboxes of the paddles are very wrong and I literally go through the ball or the ball bounces off in some weird angle. It's pretty frustrating sometimes but regardless it's a very active and enjoyable game. Also I found out that other people can control the ""opponent"" on your PC, but due to the viewing angle I presume that wouldn't work too well, good concept though.I think the pricing is very accurate and the game is well worth 10€.

												I've been ignoring this because similar style games like SPT don't do much for me, but I decided to give it a shot because of the reviews. It's INCREDIBLE. I felt like I was in some sort of dystopian future, battle to the death with an AI. The mechanics are fantastic. The 2D screenshots don't do the graphics justice, because being inside a Tron style world just completes the game.When a good volley starts going you can't help but really attack the ball, which gets to the point of visceral catharsis. My 2.5m x 3m playspace with a low ceiling doesn't let me get too nuts, but I'd imagine a larger playspace with a ceiling you can't reach would be insane.I've played at least 10 other titles on my Vive, and while this might not be the most complicated, it's the most fun I've had.

												Great fun, and I've heard that the physics improved from an earlier version, however as I play it seems the ball acts quite sparratic when you hit it. 90% of the goals for the AI are simply me hitting the ball and it going backwards, and sometimes the ball will spawn while I am bringing my arm down from a swing, causing me to hit it into my own goal. Either way, highly recommend this game, the biggest enemy is yourself.EDIT: TIME DOES NOT FLY WHILE PLAYING THIS GAME. I played vigorously for what felt like hours but in reality only half an hour has passed as of writing this. SWEAT-AY.			",81,15,1,7,13,2,8

												I LOVE to hate Holoball.  I will caveat this review with I have a good size play space and this is my first review on Steam.  I highly recommend this game to anyone looking to get some physical exercise from their VR.  Because of this game I have upgraded my wrist straps (I used the ones from an old Wii controller) and bought headphones designed for runnners (with a headband) so that I can make the most out of playing the game.I am only average at the game but it is a fun game, I love the insulting AI, and the immersion is fantastic.  When I was more active back in the day I used to play racketball and the developers nailed the feel of a large court with the VR.  I find myself talking smack to the AI and it drives me crazy when it is 4 -4 in the 5th round and I lose.  But most importantly, after playing and I check my Fitbit, I typically have burned 250+ calories.Thanks for reading.			",235,28,16,20,29,7,10

												I have owned a VIVE for about a week now and spent rediculous amounts of time ""in there"" as I love it so much.This low priced, simple game is amazing and along with SPT my favourite game.The atmosphere is great, polished style and amazing gameplay.Developers have done something I havent seen on any other game too, those not in the game can actually control the camera to see what is going on in the game, and can control the ""ai"" part in the game. This is an amazing idea that no one else seems to have thought of, that I have found anyway.A two player game where one is in VR and the other(s) not is a brilliant concept.My only negative comment is that the second player should be able to use the mouse to control the AI paddle, as using arrow keys is way too hard to keep up.Its on sale as I write this and I would say this has to be a muxt have game in your VR library.Keeps you fit too :)			",116,55,9,1,41,6,4

												Aiming seems off a lot, I keep hitting the ball and watch it fly off in a random direction and even trying to repeat the same hit seems to give completely different results, its also difficult to reach the correct swing angle sometimes.That said, this is SO fun. The AI's lines are amusing and when your shot decides to do what you actually intended, its very satisfying.BE WARNED, you WILL hit a lot ceiling or anything close to your bounds, this game makes you move like crazy and swing with force. Also use wrist straps, preferably a pair stronger than the ones that come with the vive. I suggest WII remote ones.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I enjoy this game, but whish some problems were fixed.Resetting of player position, ball shouldn't appear until player is back on ""mound"".Often times I hit the ball by accident with the controller when the ball appears.Different return velocities would be nice, and when the back paddel hits, it seems it doesn't bounce off of it but set. I think some work could be done here. Also the game makes you want to use your wrist to when instead of your arm.Getting an accurate hit should be more important than velocity.I have never gone beyond easy, and the player should get more points for longer play action, than less points I think.Some time penalty I think is bogus. It's a fun game, but the scoring seems to be opposite of fun. The more fun you have, the less your score which seems just wrong to me. ",29,0,0,1,1,2,0

												The game is fun for a brief play through, but i've barely played it.  This is mostly because I don't have 10ft ceilings.  It is very hard to play this game unless you have very tall ceilings.  It also is a very basic game.  It reminds me of super curveball 3d which I used to play in my browser for free.  I can't recommend this game based on these points.  It is a cool game to demo to people, but I don't trust others to not smash my contorllers enough to let them play.Update to my review:  I got a resonse from the developers which is awesome and fixed my height issue.  I still think 9.99 is a bit steep, but all of the early VR games seem overpriced to me.  I think when more content is available the price of these games will go down.  I will change my recommendation of No to Yes with this update from Dev's (partially because responding to user issues is awesome) with a caveat of I think the price is a bit high but this helps alot with my issue.

												This is my absolute favorte VR game at the moment.  If you have a larger than average room you'll get quite a workout from it as you dart from side to side.  Unlike some other VR games that have you hitting a projectile, this one doesn't seem to have any issue with the ball passing through the paddles, it feels completely fair.  If you have a lot of space, definitely get this.  Even if you don't, it's extremely well put together and likely a great time, I just haven't tried it in limited space.			",674,185,26,142,75,16,87

												The game is lots of fun and similar to Holopoint makes you move a lot, especially in the high difficulties.As a long time tennis player I enjoyed hitting the ball and seeing that there is at least some kind of spin mechanic.However, this might just be me, but I feel like pretty often the hitboxes of the paddles are very wrong and I literally go through the ball or the ball bounces off in some weird angle. It's pretty frustrating sometimes but regardless it's a very active and enjoyable game. Also I found out that other people can control the ""opponent"" on your PC, but due to the viewing angle I presume that wouldn't work too well, good concept though.I think the pricing is very accurate and the game is well worth 10€.

												This game quickly became my favourite vive game, after trying loads of different games.  It reminds me of the sport ""Squash"".  And as a casual badminton player i found this game to my liking.My first thought before buying this game was the feeling that it had similarities to Air Hockey. Which i absolutely love. The difference here is that you're not playing on a flat table but in a three dimensional room. You can make cool ricochet shots or try to smash a straight, well placed shot.The game has a multiplayer element where one steers the ""ai"" with the keyboard. I tired it for a few seconds while demoing it to a friend. but it was to hard to hit the ball when controlling the ai which made it very easy for the player.The music is fantastic, filled with energy. I read reviews of there being only one song, but that must have been updated. As of now i think there is atleast three songs that i know of.The game is well worth the money. It provides alot of fun and a great workout			",154,30,2,9,14,1,4

												Good Game!  So far the best raquet ball sim I've played.  Oculus has some Japanese tennis one but playing on an xbox one controller is useless vs the vive where you actually simulate a raquet swing.  Oculus without the controllers and roomscale is just not ready for prime time like Vive is.  Hard to believe they didn't wait to come to market until they at least had the controllers ready!!!  That's like buying a Nintendo Wii without the motion controller!Having said that however, the AI games are way too easy.  I completed expert on the first try with lots of aces.  For a real raquet ball/tennis player, you'd have to go to custom right away.My suggestion to make this game a long term success is to add ONLINE multiplayer support so you can compete against others.  I'm sure you guys are already thinking about doing this.  This is VITAL to the success of this title and replayability.  Also, can you please add a practice mode that is full speed?  I like to play against the wall against myself in real life and I can't do that here without the ball slowing down in Zen mode.  Just give us a full speed zen mode so you can play yourself!

												It's simple but the design is very efficient and the game is tons of fun! If you have a vive this is one of the games you have to get and experience. It's very replayable (I play a couple of matches every day now) and it's a game where you actually have to be physically active, you feel good after playing it and it really makes you want to beat the ai.It isn't as polished as it could be and after beating the expert mode (which will take you some while until you get there) there is only one mode left which is kind of endless. So the content could be bigger.I hope the developers will add multiplayer matches and an ai mode in which you set in more detail how fast he should be or how hard he can play the ball back at you. Also I wish the matches would be longer, so it actually feels like a squash or tennis match.Can highly recommend it but I hope there will be more content soon in form of a dlc or so.

At times, I fondly recall the original Atari, and, others, Portal (GladOS comparisons, and such).The game is polished and fun. If you have a VIve, get this.  Just get it.EDIT: The new updates make the game more compelling, and the developers are workinf around-the-clock to polish the update.  Great game, great dev!			",179,40,4,3,23,6,3

												The game is pretty simple on the surface - it's a mix of pong and racquetball/squash. However, it is incredibly fun and extremely replayable. I can see myself playing this daily for months and months as a fan of racquetball. It already has local multiplayer (one person in the Vive vs the other person controlling the AI paddle with WASD). If they manage to get online multiplayer up and running it'll get even better. There are different difficulty levels which is great for families, everyone can try this. Just make sure to use the wrist straps with this game, quite a few people have let the controllers fly out of their hands when they go for a quick swing.			",115,32,1,8,12,3,4

												Aiming seems off a lot, I keep hitting the ball and watch it fly off in a random direction and even trying to repeat the same hit seems to give completely different results, its also difficult to reach the correct swing angle sometimes.That said, this is SO fun. The AI's lines are amusing and when your shot decides to do what you actually intended, its very satisfying.BE WARNED, you WILL hit a lot ceiling or anything close to your bounds, this game makes you move like crazy and swing with force. Also use wrist straps, preferably a pair stronger than the ones that come with the vive. I suggest WII remote ones.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You control A paddle with each hand to hit a ball and try and get it past the paddle controlled by the a.i in a 3d space. All I can say is this game is some cheap addicting fun.

												I enjoy this game, but whish some problems were fixed.Resetting of player position, ball shouldn't appear until player is back on ""mound"".Often times I hit the ball by accident with the controller when the ball appears.Different return velocities would be nice, and when the back paddel hits, it seems it doesn't bounce off of it but set. I think some work could be done here. Also the game makes you want to use your wrist to when instead of your arm.Getting an accurate hit should be more important than velocity.I have never gone beyond easy, and the player should get more points for longer play action, than less points I think.Some time penalty I think is bogus. It's a fun game, but the scoring seems to be opposite of fun. The more fun you have, the less your score which seems just wrong to me. ",29,0,0,1,1,2,0

												This scratches my love for raquetball in the best possible way. Apart from hitting the ductwork on my basement ceiling, this is awesome. Some decent exercise too! Having the leaderboards is a great touch. I'll suggest a daily leaderboard as well - eventually the overalls will be untouchable. Simple compelling gameplay in the best sense.

												I thought I'd check this out since it's cheap. Played for two hours non-stop, screaming and sweating, Don't even try this if you have a low ceiling or low hanging ceiling lamps. You'll smash something. Guaranteed. If they manage to solve latency problems for multiplayer, this is gonna be a must-have game. Well, it already is.			",11,15,1,1,9,1,1

												I played the Beta version of this game. It's best described as playing squash/ tennis in a tron like environment. Certainly worth owning if you enjoy playing racket based sport games. That all said, you do need space.  I have a 2.3m x 2.3m play area and whilst it was more than enough to play the game for the most part, I did  bounce off my wall once and hit my light 2 twice so you need clearance above you as well.  Still fun though!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had a chance to play this pre-release. The game is a blast to play. Think ""pong for VR."" Three modes: one zen (basically you hit it with yourself), easy/medium/hard vs AI, and endurance, which allows you to keep playing until you lose.Beating the three difficulties doesn't take long, but climbing the leaderboards provides for something to come back to. The game lends itself perfectly to multiplayer (not yet in), and I can't wait for that.Very polished as well. Any issues I had with the game were minor (occasionally easy to lose the ball blended against the background, sweet spot on the AI's wall that gives you an automatic point if you hit it is a little too generous).One of the games I most enjoy, and keep thinking about after I'm done playing. ""Just one more game.""			",130,22,1,11,18,6,12

												This is just like playing racket ball except you are wearing a VR headset.  A really cool title and quite a bit of fun.  Hopefully this will add some more challenges into it as even the hard mode is not that hard.  Still I highly recommend it for the price.  Really shows off some movement with VR.

												GREAT game.  This and Audioshield are in daily rotation.  Basically, a spin on racquetball. Its not a very deep game, but very arcadey and a blast to play.  My only complaint is limited MP and the robovoice can be a bit hard to understand (but rest assured, it is mocking you).			",58,17,4,5,11,2,3
