YouTube™ Video: TableTop Soccer [Game Review] 

			Views: 602		

			My review of ""TableTop Soccer"", a turn-based soccer game developed and published by Dancing Developers. Copy supplied by developer.		

Game: TableTop SoccerGenre: Turn-based Soccer GameDeveloper: Dancing DevelopersPublisher: Dancing DevelopersCopy supplied by developerTableTop Soccer is a turn-based strategy soccer game developed and published by Dancing Developers. I am not a big sports guy, and I despise watching soccer, so keep that in mind while reading.GRAPHICSPowered by the Unity engine, the game doesn't look very good: the animations are a bit stiff and the character models don't have many details. But this un-polishedness (don't think that's a real word) gives the game a clear identity, and in the long run they are quite charming.GAMEPLAYIn each turn, you can move each player to a certain limited spot of the field, and if one of them has the ball you can make him shoot it anywhere. When near the net, you can try and shoot either left, right or center to score a point. This is not easy to explain, so I do recommend watching some gameplay footage.While not intuitive at first, it gets more and more fun as time goes on, especially after you customize your players in their names and in their gender and in their clothes. The game can be fully played Solo or online either in real-time or with turns, so that you can keep playing multiple matches at once.CHALLENGEThe AI gets progressively more challenging as time goes on, with better strategies and clearer goals (no pun intended). Thankfully, it never gets too frustrating or too easy: it stays in a very good balance of fun and challenge.SOUNDPretty weak soundtrack and sound effects. I turned on Spotify and listened to my own playlist while playing.REPLAYABILITYLimitless: play with many players and improve your players' stats to create the ultimate team.Overall, I have to say that this game was a lot of fun: interesting gameplay, good customization and great multiplayer component make this an enjoyable casual game that you should check out if you like the concept. Easily the second best soccer game for non-sports fan, right after Rocket League.Story: n/aGraphics: 5Gameplay: 8Challenge: 8.5Sound: 5.5Replayability: 9ENJOYMENT: 7.5FRUSTRATION: 3Follow me on Twitter: @nickygra97Subscribe to my channelLike on FacebookJoin my Steam group ",532,126,11,40,24,4,34

												Anyone that knows me knows just how over the top and passionate I can be about sports. I’ve always been that way. I was raised by a sports crazed mother who you could hear shouting from one end of the street to the other whenever her beloved Carlton Football Team were playing. In many ways I have become just like her as an adult. We follow the same Aussie Rules team and I have been known to go ballistic whenever my team is scoring or if they’re getting the rough end of the stick from the umpires. Some might say think as bad as my team has been since we won our last premiership (1995) that I think that we only ever lose games due to the umpiring and not because we just flat out suck (I know we do!) Whenever I get an opportunity to get my hands on a sports game I’m generally extremely excited to the point where it can be argued that one of my weaknesses as a game writer or reviewer is the inability to critique a sports game too harshly.This is the first game by Dancing Developers on Steam. The game is also on iOS. It suits both platforms. It suits Steam because you can play multiplayer games either live or in a play by mail method. What this means is that if you and a friend or challenger live on the other side of the world or in different cities or just have different schedules that dictate that you wouldn’t normally get an opportunity to play against them you can do so. You can play a turn and then you can wait for your opponent to play their turn whether that takes a few hours or a few days. You can finish a game at your leisure. That’s even better for those who don’t have that long to play. Log in before breakfast and make a move and you’re done within a couple of minutes. A great concept and one that has been tried and true since even before Steam’s existence and done outside of video games but a really good one for a soccer game.For those who do get to experience the live play you will have a timer. It begins relatively slow but I am promised that as you level up and become more battle hardened that the time speeds up. I’m guessing that if you are playing a lower leveled friend that you’ll be expected to play at the lower level’s speed but I haven’t gotten to that point yet. There’s a lot of strategy that you will have to consider within the allotted time as well. It’s not as simple as get ball and kick goal. You need to factor in the same things that make football one of the most strategic sports on the planet. What will your opponent do and how will you outsmart him. In many ways the in game use of strategy is far more important here than in setting default settings and changing on the fly in Football Manager.The presentation of the game is relatively simple. It doesn’t need to be anything especially great. It delivers just what you need. However, you will need to play the tutorial first because the overlay of the game can be especially frustrating and confusing for a beginner. Thankfully once you play the tutorial you’ll understand the presentation overlay and UI. However, I would like to have seen a better explanation of all of the starting power ups. Learning them on their own was more guess work than what most will ever put in the effort to find out.At $4.99 TableTop Soccer is fair value for money if you have a friend or can find opponents to challenge you. Beating the computer AI only rewards you with a quarter of the experience you would otherwise generate playing against a real person so those who find it difficult to get into a match will have a difficult time leveling up at the same rate as their equally skilled counterparts.

Excellent little game for the price.Thing I liked:-RTS Soccer (football) is a really cool idea-Helpful tutorial-Ability to play on several platforms and cross platform-Looks like the dev is going to be updating again soon too-Easy price to justify (especially on a sale)Things that could use improvement:-Could use some more 'flash' or 'juice' to transitions and animations between events			",720,196,32,100,82,7,123

												There is a definite skill to this game in predicting what your oppenent's next move will likely be, moving to intercept and being unpredicable yourself. Easy game to pick up, but can be difficult when playing against someone who actually knows what they're doing.  Surpringly satisfying when scoring goals, leveling characters and schooling friends ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

TableTop Soccer I've had fun playing this game in beta, because I was lucky enough to get a early beta code. I would definitly recommend it if you have played FIFA and games like that. Instead of using the arrow keys or wasd to move, you use your mouse, so it is very stratigical.It is worth at least taking a look at. :)+1 ",50,8,0,5,6,0,5

												As a football fan who enjoys turn based strategy games I love this game. It's simple enough to be accesible and involving enough to be enjoyable, scoring goals gives me a genuine kick (pun intended). I highly recomend this to anyone who enjoys frozen syanpse and is looking for a fun yet challenging game.			",100,12,6,3,14,0,15

												I liked 'football' games since the day when I had an electric football game back in the '50s http://www.retroland.com/electric-football/I also like turn-based games so when I found TableTop Soccer for the iPad I instantly BOUGHT it but found it very hard to play due to touch interface issues and deleted the game (see the discussion post ""Alternative to...?""). The developer immediately responded to my post and gifted me the PC version to try. Well, the touch interface issues I mentioned were not present in the PC version and TableTop Soccer is a joy to play. And the developer mentioned that he would soon patch the iPad version with an added option to turn off that screen scroll that annoyed me so much. So I immediately re-installed the iPad version on my iPad so that I could get the new patched version as soon as it is fixed. This is a great indie game made by a great developer who cares about players of his game and has pride is his work. There is not better support anywhere. Buy this enjoyable game and support an indie developer who cares.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm totally biased (I did sound design/music) but I've really enjoyed learning the ins and outs of this game! I'm not a big soccer fan, and don't play a lot of strategy games but this is the perfect balance. It's very much like playing a strategic tabletop game like chess or checkers. It's easy to pick up, but hard to master. Good for playing with friends, and the turn-based nature works well for async gaming.  ",1189,407,33,153,106,12,197

												Mixing soccer with turn based tactic is quite innovative, and this game do it well.There is also some kinf of RPG evolution of the team while you play, giving points to players to change their stats.The match versus the bot are fun, but get boring after some games. Matches against human are very good, with the ""play later"" style that let you have a lot of game going on at the same time.The problem is that the community is really small, so you may end up with ten open mathces with the same 3 players or, worse, fail to find someone to play with.

												Great game made better with someone to play with, however online matchmaking works great even without too many playing at the moment. This is helped by the ""resumable"" games that allow you to play a turn at a time with the same player. Definitely worth the price and has tons of different ways to play your team, adding more replayability than expected. The planned additions look great and feedback on bugs/issues with the game has been fantastic and very quick.The Boosts add a nice extra touch to the mind games but they seem a little plentiful. So far boosts and the combo are necessities compared to the others. Finally, the difference in a new player with no upgrade points against even someone whose played for a few hours is incredible. Game is not unwinnable but being able to move twice as far and save every shot even point blank gets very frustrating,  ",53,4,2,3,20,1,24

												Im an eager chess player myself, no so much the sporter type however, but this little interesting game really stands out to me. I love a good game that provides me with a challenge that is blind to the player until the next move, really makes you think ahead.I believe this game is a ""Quantity over Quality"", where graphics are not required to make a unqiue game such as this stand out. I will admit, I did get this game for free off a friend, but it was well worth checking out.If anyone was interested in getting a game that requires a little bit of brain work, combined with a sporting touch, this game has been made especially for you. Well worth checking out.			",157,55,8,9,22,2,14

												*I bought this game Via Groupees*I've played this game for just under an hour and I loved every second of playing it. I've only played singleplayer because no one seems to be playing at midnight though I have got a resumable game going which means Steam will tell you when the other person has made their move so you can go on and take your turn which is great.The game isn't great looking but it's also not terribly looking which is absolutely fine because the gameplay is perfect and everything works fine. You basically control your players in a turn based style very similar to Frozen Synapse, there are a handful of boosts to use though you can only use 8 of them overall each game and only 1 of each every turn. At 15 turns it's half time and the other player kicks off. The game is very strategic and allows you to create and customise your players, even allowing you to create your own formations. Do you send all your players forward? Have one player forward and hold everyone else back to defend? It's up to you but you will have to plan and predict carefully and quickly.Honestly this game does pretty much everything it should do and it does it flawlessly. I give the game a 9/10 for being a great take on Football while also keeping it fun and no massive or noticable issues.			",488,122,31,54,86,10,49

												Awesome game! I've been playing the beta for a few weeks now, and I'm happy to see it's live.It's a crazy mix of action and strategy, and has a bunch of interesting features, like being able to upgrade your team members abilities. Different game modes include single player, live multiplayer, and turn-based multiplayer which is one of the first times I've seen this. Kind of like chess, where each person picks their moves and sends it back to the opponent. It also links to the iPhone app, so you can continue playing on your phone.Deceptively simple, I still get a rush every time I'm able to score a goal!			",96,15,6,11,61,0,17

												Good idea, simple controls. The gameplay is good as is. This is why I don't refund, I want this game to happen!Need to be polished A LOT. After 1-2 minutes in queue, no match was made and I quit.To fellow players: play solo and challenge friends, you can have fun with this and wait for updates.Hoping dev reads this: - get better 3D models, this is ridiculous in the bad way - also, get some pretty, or at least, well-designed sound effects, also music and fonts and everything (sorry :D ) - you should probably provide info about how many players are in queue and how many matches are in progress, maybe an estimation on the time remaining in queueApart from that, I do recommend the game to increase its rating and get more players.

												This is a really fun take on a turn based soccer game.  Hopefully it catches on and more players start playing the multiplayer because it is a little quiet right now.  Playing the computer is fun enough for a bit, but the computer is extremely predicatable without much variation in tactics.  I would also like to see a little more variety in the player skins.  Seems there is just one look per race.			",149,39,3,45,19,1,25

												Cool, fast-action game for single or multi-player. I eventually got around to naming my team and choosing gender/uniforms, but what I like most is that I have to anticipate what my opponent might do and act accordingly. I can move all 5 players in one turn, and when the timer is up, I just hope I went the right way. The AI is easier to play against, but the real fun is playing others online as they are way more unpredictable. Boosts allow you to run faster, pass the ball, attach your player's movements to another player on the opposing team, and make combo shots (pass to another and then shoot to score). I first played this on IOS, and I like that resumable (offline, turn-based) games can be played here on steam or on my iPhone, depending on where I am. Lots of new players, so you can put your name in the queue and play a stranger, or make a friend and challenge them directly. I like the real-time games best, but it's cool that this is like ""Words with Friends"" for soccer (I take a couple of turns, and then I'm alerted when my opponent does the same). Awesome job, Developer!			",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

												This is an updated review.  My initial review is below. YOU MUST BUY THIS GAME.This is a great fun game. If you like turn based games, or you like Football, you really need to buy TableTop Soccer. Score goals, win games, earn points, upgrade your player stats, then go out and battle.  This game is good when playing the computer, but it gets taken to another level when you challenge another human.  Trying to predict what another player is going to do is such a challenge.  It's the sort of game that you want to play with friends, so you can gloat over your great plays.  The developer of this game responded very quickly to my initial review and implemented my suggestions.  Not only that, but they have worked to fix issues and improve the game by taking suggestions from the community and implementing fixes.I cannot recommend the game or the developer enough.  I will definitely be buying this for  friends.Can I recommend for newer players picking this up you add a 4-pack?=================================================I was sold when I watched the first video.  I bought it, I played it, I loved it.. Then my internet connection died, and I became annoyed with it.It's a really fun game, but make sure you have a solid reliable internet connection.  If you have an internet connection that drops out, expect to lose your match progress in solo games.  The resumable game only works if you have saved the game, unfortunately the game doesn't auto-save after each turn is played.   For an online game, auto saving after each turn is a necessity when playing solo.If you don't have internet problems, do buy this game :)			",257,47,11,13,18,7,25
