												Ok, first things first, I'm a huge animal lover (have a bunch of cats), I hate REAL hunting but this is a video game, so I don't care at all about killing a virtual deer. Just like I don't care about killing a cop in GTA, but pretty sure I would never do that myself in real life nor would I like it if any one else does. Big Buck Hunter Arcade is not real life. The game itself is good. I have all the possible home editions of this series. It doesn't stray to far away from them. If like the others, you'll like this. I only have 2 minor complaints and one big one:1)  Loading take a lot longer than it should (gameplay AND menus)2)  No girls! What? C'mon, why is it ok in your other home games and arcade but not here. Don't understand that decision to leave them out... It just adds to the humor of the whole thing and keeps the atmosphere light. Hard to explain....The big one:Raw input is not supported. So not only can I not use my aimtrak gun during gameplay (fine in menus), I cannot do two players with guns. Not sure of the api exactly, but it's obvious it was designed for xbox pads to give them greater control at the sacrifice of accomodating us gun users. (you can use mouse fine). I also have NO idea how to play with two players - i had a keyboard, mouse, Xbone pad and aimtrak gun connected and all just controlled player 1. Probably need another xbone pad...I'm hopeful they'll patch this thing up and address a few of the issues I highlighted. Regardless, it's still a good, simple pick and play rail/wave shooter. Plus it's cheap, just buy it!			",99,9,23,0,8,3,5
