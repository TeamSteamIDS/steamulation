												Simple. Fun.  I'm a retired hockey goalie.  When on ""Bullet"" mode it felt like I was playing again.			",294,128,13,57,84,5,48

												A fun little Goalkeeping game for VR.The game is split into a bunch of different challenges. These are pretty much different game modes where a factor or two is changed to spice things up. One for example is the ""Shrinking Hands"" game mode. As you save more and more balls the smaller your hands become. Another example is the ""Slow Mo"" game mode where balls come at you in slow mo and it feels like you're The Flash saving balls with super speed.The game is well worth the price point to the point where its almost a steal for this price. Highly Recommended.			",108,33,1,7,23,4,23

												Being a former Hockey Goalie, this game pretty much simulates what it is like to be in net's. This could be a huge game changer for sport training/practice, athletes could practice at anytime in their own home! fantastic A++++.Great for cardio too ;).			",37,12,2,2,5,1,0

												I quite enjoy the game, but I wish the developer would add an 'old man (55+) easy' setting;  both a bit slower and the ability to shrink the height/width of the net, particularly the bending over - perhaps the balls coming in no lower than the knees.			",35,19,1,1,9,0,2

												Good for short bouts of occasional exertion and to test your reflexes. Use your marshmallow hands to block the incoming footballs. A few game modes to mix it up but fundamentally the same objective. Price is okay. It's not much to pay, but there are free VR titles which offer an equal or more content than GoalkeepVr.
