								The game mechanics are very poor. Movement is very clunky and by the time to teleport to the ball it has moved. When you throw the ball there is lag from when you press throw to it actually releasing. This needs alot of work and personally say don't bother with this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Not even close to being ready. Lots of lag for me (one second after I threw the ball it would register as being thrown). A bit of micro-juddering on i7-6700K GTX 1080 with reprojection off. *update: micro-judder gone now. AI players are great.			",64,40,4,1,43,5,2
