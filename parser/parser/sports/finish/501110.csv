Been playing it using HTC VIVE and it is pure fun!!GAMEPLAY!!! You have 2 lines to choose for each DropPoint, and each line can be passed using the red rings (bigger) and the yellow rings (smaller). Yellow rings will provide the ""Perfection"" objetives and will grant more points that the basic ones. Some of those lines are really original and crazy ones!! like passing under bridges, holes, giant donuts, avoiding trees and many other surprises...Besides that the creative part are the added bonuses and hidden things. Those make you think..hmmm can I pass over there? let's see!! and that is where the wacky things will happen.And that's not all, let me tell you that I found the RECORD THE PRO MODE, incredible!!You have to follow another PRO Wingsuit like if you were recording it....without going to far to loose him or pass it to miss the record. And you have another SURVIVAL MODE where you cannot see things at least when they are too close...and there is too much wind...really hard and creative.UPDATE 12/09/2016:Let me tell you that I keep finding several hidden surprises and really great ways to fly over the same droppoints and that is why I cannot stop playing. Sometimes I just fly for the pure pleasure of trying crazy things. Really the game has a long life and long replay value. So far you will have 20 DropPoints in the game to unlock gradually.Each DropPoint will provde you 2 main Line Courses (with normal and perfection level on each), then you will have also the RECORD THE PRO MODE and the SURVIVAL MODE on each too and also several minor objetives, and 3 basic SCORE objetives too.Survival Mode is another way to play, when you enable it, the weather will change completly, you won´t see so far because of dense fog, and the wind conditions are really strong. In that way, you have to reach the end safely...and is going to be reaaally difficult and exciting to play. Love the Idea....I think it was an original approach.GREAT GAMEPLAY!! 9/10Here is one example video:

CONTROLS: You can control the Wingsuit direction with your head!!! I enabled that option and it works good, and I mean that sometimes if you watch to much to your R/L you are going to screw your flying :P Besides that you use the gamepad and is not difficult to start but it has a normal learning curve to start creating wild maneuvers and flips in the air...the result in VR is....WOOOOOOOOOOOOW. However, I do agree that if developers may add optional VIVE controllers support to simulate the hands it could be amazing if they pull the right control scheme.7/10 VR EXPERIENCE: Initially I thought it was not as extreme...but after playing more and more, I realized that the initial Wingsuits maybe are slows to give the player an easy introduction. Later as you gradually unlock new Wingsuits the game starts to push your boundaries and the speed gets really intense. Also you will start trying so much crazy thing that the VR EXPERIENCE will make you mad at some narrow points or stunts. Cardiac Experience: 8.5/10---------------------------------OVERALL SCORE: 8.5/10 Can't stop playing it-----------------------------------Additional notes (for all those who want details)PERFORMANCE: I've enabled all details to ""Very High"" and 2xAA with RenderTarget set to 1.2. I'm using and I7 + 980ti + 16gb Ram on Windows 10 and it plays PERFECT. If I raise RenderTarget to 1.3...I can see a very little stuttering if I turn my head (something you don't want in these games at all)There is certain room for Improvements here... I'm asking the developers to improve the DEATHS of the character because there is so much fun here (Dark souls players...come here!!! you will enjoy this game too :P), 3rd person view, VIVE CONTROLLERS support, etc. But the game today at 1.0, works as advertised correctly.0 Motion Sickness from my side....and I'm doing crazy turns out there ...ohhh yeah.BONUS: Some special moments in the game:

												So my girlfriend and I were playing some HTC VIVE VR demo, where you stand on a mountain, you walk a bit and you can enjoy an impressive photo realistic view. at some point, my girlfriend says ""it would be SO cool if you could jump down with one of those wingsuits"".... so i googled, found THIS game ""MOUNT WINGSUIT""... bought it, installed it, all WHILE my gf was still in VR. at some point i say ""pooky i have a surprise for you"". We had a BLAST!!! The game is like ""Tony Hawk"" games, or remember ""amped"" ? a cool snowboard game for xbox and playstation a few years back? Where you had a few mountains, and lots of ""challenges"" to do in order to unlock stuff? well, this game is similar, only instead of snowboards or skateboards, you use a wingsuit!!! You unlock like 20 different starting points, each with its set of challenges (these include and are not limited to: collecting letters to create a word, reach a number of points, breaking a window when flying past a certain house, fly through dounuts, do neck breaking stunts like backflips or barrel rolls, get bonus points for flying close to the ground, collect unknown spheres that give you lots of points and more!!) price is ok-ish, given the amount of content... 20 droppoints with each like 10-15 different challenges? Thats pretty decent! AND we had a blast, and isnt that what games are about? great game to show friends when they come over, especially the ones that get woozy when looking down from high places >:D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Some of the most fun I've had with the Vive. Seems like an odd statement given some of the games out, but I was hooked for three hours straight the first time I booted it up. Addictive like a lot of the snowboarding and skating games that were great on consoles, tons of challenges and a steady progression of unlocks. It never feels grindy, but is definitely challenging. The Vive controllers work extremely well once you get a feel for it (be sure to check out the controls/mapping in options). I'm not prone to motion/VR sickness, so I won't be much help on that front, but they do have a ""stomach"" mode that is supposed to help folks with that problem. The sense of speed, height and trajectory are all great. After an hour or so it begins to feel natural and you're bending through the air. The environment/world is great. The mountains, lines, challenges and atmosphere are all great. There are 20 total bases to unlock and jump from, and each one exposes a new part of the world, a unique area that looked like it may have just been background scenery in earlier jumps. This is a sleeper hit, if you have even a passing interest in wingsuits, smacking into things going 175 mph or jumping off of tall objects...it gets a solid recommendation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												OMFG. i have it, i played it, i'm so good at it. this game feels perfect. perfect in physics, perfect in aerodynamics and perfect in regards of speed. oh, i forgot, perfect sound design, too. unbelievable, what you you can do in this game, so much stuff. be the cam-wingsuiter who films the pro, fly through tubes, find hidden stuff, play a replay of your flight done with ground-cameras and so on. you need an xbox-controller for this game. an original one! the cheap china copies dont have the needed resolution on the sticks which you'll need in this game. this is one of the best 3 vr experiences i ever had (one of the other 2 being lunar flight btw). vr is made for experiences like this. this game will keep me very busy! outstanding work, devs! ps.: multiplayer and online leaderboards would be great.

												FIrst up, a bit of a warning.  This one has a learning curve to it, especially if you're using the Vive controllers.  Expect to spend your first thirty minutes or so smashing into cliffs and trying to make sense of what the hell is going on.  The controls need a very subtle touch, and figuring out exactly how to hold them is a bit of a trial-and-error process right now.Do NOT give up.  Once it ""clicks"" it is amazing.  I have no idea what ""real"" wingsuit flying is like, but this feels spectacular.  I found myself frequently holding my breath during close-shave passes with cliffsides and narrow gaps.  Going from my first fumbling attempts at flight to screaming through concrete pipes at high speed without fear feels amazing.  I've only explored the first two drop sites, and I'm already hooked.

												I've got this to play on my HTC vive after a friend recommended it to me. I've got to say that I love it. I set up a fan in front of me and the immersion is great. It took a few attempts to get the hang of it but it is quite intuitive with the vive motion controllers and feels very natural now. Well worth the £10.99			",16,8,1,6,4,0,3

												It's a great idea, and I would honestly love the game to pieces if it weren't for how inconsistent the controls were. One round, I'll have about a 30 degree difference between going up and going down, which is normal. You'd usually see a someone using a wingsuit have his arms around his thighs or so like that. Then there are the random times, mid flight mind you, where my controls will suddenly require me to swing my arms almost 180 degrees to change from up to down or vice versa, and it's really annoying during my attempts at perfect runs, basically making them entirely impossible.

												I just got this game a few days ago, and have already played 8 hours. For a Vive game that means something.   It's like Tony Hawk Pro Skater, but on a giant mountain with a wingsuit. Not onlly is this the most fun game I've played on the vive, but it's getting me my VR legs. I just got the vive recently and don't experience much sickness, though my first drop in No Limits 2 (rollercoaster sim) I Imediately felt it bad and had to rip off the headset.    My first drop in this game I didn't feel it while playing too badly at all, but I felt some adrenaline and fear. When I took the headset off though I was a little nausious for a good hour or two. Since then I have played it in increased amounts of time every day, because it is soo fun, and I am happy to say that after my last 90 minute session I experienced NO nausia. And I still scream like a girl when I try to do a back flip and end up flying backwards into the mountain to my death. If you are new to vive start sitting down and do a drop or two until you feel no neusia. For those with VR legs I suggest playing it standing up, and turning down the in game music and putting on spottify or pandora instead. Standing up with my favorite tunes on makes this game super immersive and great with so much potential for replayability. I'm only on drop 45of like 20, and I've completed maybe 12 objectives out of hundreds. Great VR game with lots of content. Don't miss this.

												started out not too impressed, i didnt experience ANY motion sickness (most likely due to my experience now with VR) but ive since come to be really happy with my purchase! the wingsuiting is actually pretty fun. when you get the hang of it , its like the wing suiting in JUST CAUSE 3 only in VR. who wouldnt want that? the collectables havent been a thing ive tried yet, i mainly went to finish courses, but i did notice theres a bit of 'pick the right wingsuit for the job"" type thing going on as one suit i picked couldnt finish the course, no matter what i did or how well i flew. thats cool ,forcing players to know the strenghts and weaknesses of the suits.OVERALL- i enjoyed the game and itll be one of my mainstays!GREAT JOB DEVS!!ALSO!little pro tip! the wingsuit follows your head when steering, that in conjunction with  yawning should get you better turns.the roll button has to be held ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE TURN!landing on the pile of boxes DOESNT require opening the chute! you can just ""dive"" in!

												Playing with HTC Vive:1. This is the game you are looking for.2. Do not rage quit and ask for a refund, that just means that you a) haven't logged enough time with the Vive and/or b) you haven't spent enough time getting a feel for this game -- practice more before you miss out on this game!!!3. Bravo to the devs for making the controls so intuitive -- once you get it, you will get it. Like those wierd ""3D"" posters from (ahem) 25 years ago...4. For Noobs -- I have found that sitting in my chair, resting my elbows on my knees as a starting position works well, and use your wrists for most motion. It is about feel, and VERY important to look ahead (like a race car driver looks ahead into the furthest turn they can see, your body will react intuitively as long as you LOOK where you WANT to go. More practice!5. It really is awesome!Looking forward to more content, better graphics (as time progresses), and multiplayer COOP would be the cat's meow. MEOW!Cheers! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I know a lot of people have stated that they avoid this game since it uses a gamepad instead of using the Vive motion controls, but honestly I can't think of a way to use motion controls that would give the same precision and sense of fun (although I know he is working on adding Vivemote control now, so we'll see).Gameplay is simple, but fun.  Hugging the grouns while flying at high speed gives a good sense of actually flying.  So far I'm completely immune to VR sickness in every game I've tried, but flying down hill and popping up quickly to just barely clear a ridgeline gives a thrill almost like riding a roller coaster.Speaking of VR sickness, beware that is can definitely be a thing for some people.  My wife played (against my advice) and made herself feel pretty ill after flying at low altitude, but to be fair she also got sick after playing Euro Truck Simulator and driving (literally) about 10 feet.If you don't suffer from motion sickness and own a gamepad, this is a must-buy.

												This game is a huge rush to play! This is the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater of VR right now. You go to a stage, do some crazy stuff and complete all the goals. Complete runs through a series of rings, get a high score, hit a certain gap or find a secret item. There are tons of missions and drop points so you can spend quite a few hours if you want to complete everything. The biggest drawback with this game is that it can induce nausea in some people.I can withstand all walking and jumping games like Windlands or Fancy Skiing, but I have trouble with the rotation in space games and in this game. I find that some days I can play for quite a while, but other days I have to stop as I feel sick. The developers have done some things to combat this, but for some people the game will just be too intense.			",247,64,16,27,30,6,10

												First up, awesome game. I've been waiting a long time for more BASE and wingsuit games. Great to see this new one on the market. Unfortunatley its almost impossible for me to play as I do not own a Xbox360 controller. I have an afterglow PS3 style controller. No matter how hard I try I can only use the left directional pad. NOTHING ELSE WORKS!!!!!! It's really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off because I can only manage basic proximity, aerobatics are completley out, not to mention I cannot succesfully land as I cannot pull my PC. Oh well, I will be purchasing a HTC Vive soon, so hopfully I will be able to play with that. Anyway I'm really hopeful and excited for this game. P.S I know this game is focused on the wingsuit and proximity experiance. But I would love to see some regular BASE and tracking suit jumping. And possibly more of an emphisis towards aerobatics. Cheers guys.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Thoroughly enjoyed my time in the game so far. The controls give a nice feeling of just enough control and feel as realistic as I would imagine the amount of control you would have falling at 100mph with a tiny surface area of cloth making you glide. The objectives are fun, varied and sometimes frustrating - but may require a revisit once I unlock better wing suits. The game has a 'pilotwings' vibe to it.There are 20 different decents down the same mountain range, with two main courses on each decent with a 16 total objectives per decent, offering freedom of what you complete and how you open up the next decent or wingsuit. The game feels like it has nicely paced progression and will take a lot of practice and work to complete every challenge. I play it on Rift and it works fine at default settings on my r9 290.

												HTC Vive.Nausea warning lol, but I have a cold so my balance is off anyway.This is a great game, worth every penny.It's not perfect, controls can twitch a little now and then and drop angles sometimes in the wrong direction, although that might be something I'm doing wrong, and it looks like there's  little gameplay from the screenshots, but there is plenty of paths and challenges, it makes you want to keep playing, lots of different locations and drops.I would recommend playing seated first time to make sure your balance is good enough to stand, seriously! LolControls scheme is good, a good workout for your upper arms and shoulders, many have said they are poor , but once you get used to it, it makes perfect sense.Awesome rush, if you want high speed skimming mountains and wind turbines while supermaning it through the sky then this is your game.One of the better Vive titles.
