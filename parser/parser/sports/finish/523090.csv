												I was honestly surprised with how good the game is for the price. Pretty unique PvP gameplay as well, with the idea being to destroy your opponent's footing and send him falling to his death before he can do the same to you. If you've been looking for a really solid PvP VR game to play with a friend, you could do a lot worse than Bomb U! for a lot more money.Check out my gameplay of Bomb U! against a friend:

												Watching the video seemed like it could be fun.  Playing it though is a another story.  It is a whole lot of fun!  I'm glad I have a Vive waterproof cover because you will sweat playing this one!  I've only played on the normal difficulty so far but keep coming back for more.  I've found myself jumping to grab an item that is thrown my way.  So even with the cartoon color pallet, it is still immersive and fun.  Best $3 I've spent in a long time! The only complaint I have about this game is how goofy you look playing it.  If someone walks in on you playing this game not seeing what you're actually doing, you do look silly :) Thanks to the developers for making this fun cost effective game!			",129,17,10,0,20,6,0

												I'm suprised, this game is a lot of fun!The graphics are clean, there are no problems with motion sickness or anythingthe opponents are sometimes really hard, you have to be really fast and accurate as in time of trowing and with aiming.Playing this online is something each owner of this game should try!

												Playing the single player against the AI is definitely a lot of fun, but this is one of the first multiplayer games that's really made me want a 2nd Vive so I could play this with my friends!One complaint: When I looked at the multiplayer games, there were at least 2 pages of populated games, but since it's all 2 player, they were all full. I spent 2 sessions of maybe 5-10 minutes hosting a game and waiting for others to join, but no luck so far. ",911,396,27,69,93,9,101

												Bomb U is a fun game that is very easy to master the controls of (trigger to grab and shoot, swing your arm and release to throw).  The enemies you face off against in single mode are challenging and the pitfall you experience when you lose gives you the feeling of actual freefall.  It's both exhilarating and scary.My nephew and I also played in multiplayer mode.  It's definitely more fun if you know the person who is going to drop, but either way this game is definitely worth a try. ",68,26,5,1,19,8,4

												This game is simple to pick up, pretty to look at, and has a *ton* of frantic action. What really makes the gameplay for me is the ability to grab thrown items out of the air, and throw 'em back at your opponent!Playing the single player against the AI is definitely a lot of fun, but this is one of the first multiplayer games that's *really* made me want a 2nd Vive so I could play this with guests!I'm *definitely* going to be showing this game to a lot of the people I demo the Vive for.One complaint: When I looked at the multiplayer games, there were at least 2 pages of populated games, but since it's all 2 player, they were all full. I spent 2 sessions of maybe 2-4 minutes hosting a game and waiting for others to join, but no luck so far.The enviornment while waiting for another player to join looks pretty cool and all (it looks like how I imagine 'Harvest Moon' would look like in VR, which is kinda awesome), but there's nothing to keep you occupied while you wait for a game to begin.If it was possible to play a game against the AI while waiting for a human opponent to join (and maybe have that be the 'default' gameplay option shown at the top of the game type menu), I think that would go a loonng way towards keeping this game's multiplayer populated.

												It's not Bomberman VR, but it has it's charm for a quick intensive round.How do you play? You are standing on a plaform made of different squares. You are handed several kind of weapons you have to through on your enemies plaform in order to destroy the squares. Once the squares are destroyed - they break by for example throughing a bomb on them - your enemy vis-à-vis falls down and you win the round. There is a MP, but which I did not test yet and several different difficulties.Cute graphics and sound. A refreshing VR idea. !!! Organize well your playground as well as the cables, as it will become a bit hectic in higher difficulties.Definitely recommended for the sale price of 1 EUR. ",1009,206,30,59,71,3,59

												Fun little game. Both singleplayer and multiplayer mode. Original idea, play mechanics are different from  most games. Make you move around a lot, catch (defense) and throw (offense) objects to make the other player fall down.. Good exercise.  So far it does not have many levels and a limited selection of weapons/items, but its a fun game well worth the very reasonable price they are charging.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The gameplay seems extremely basic to me, and then I got frustrated because I always lost. I don't know perhaps I didn't get it, but this wasn't really a fun experience. Also found it uncomfortable always having to pick stuff up from the floor.			",175,80,12,18,23,2,25

												Very fun game with easy controls and a simple, yet fun objective in the Classic gamemode. Only real gripe with this is it requires so much space and sometimes when Im reaching back I run the risk of smacking a wall. Other than that we have fun playing it.			",58,22,2,1,23,6,1

Has a glitch where you win 2 rounds and then it exits out in multiplayer.  And can you please add option to do more rounds in vs mode.  3 rounds go super fast!!! Great job guys!!
