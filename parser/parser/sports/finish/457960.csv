												One of the first VR games I played on the Vive and oh my what a game.I shot a box, the box shot me back. A few shouts of ""I'm mufukin Legolas' later and I'm breathing hard, sweating and thoroughly entertained. Scores of enemies lay shattered at my feet. Arrows embedded in the walls, the ceiling and floor. My wife thought I looked dumb shooting invisible arrows straight up at the ceiling while kneeling and swearing. I didn't. I felt like I looked awesome. You will be ducking, kneeling, spinning, nocking, shooting, nocking, shooting until you fall over. Oh ya  I did get the headset chord caught around my foot so watch out for that. Also there was bullet time when bullets and things get a little too close to your face (which is awesome) This game, it's awesome.			",911,202,21,142,101,8,176

												One of the first games I tried was Valve's ""The Lab"". I found myself gravitating towards the Longbow minigame. I liked the act of firing a bow so much that I thought I'd search for more expansive bow and arrow experience. Thats where I came across Holopoint. The mechanics of the game are quite simple, but so enjoyable. Each time I hit a target, it fires back at me, causing me to have to dodge out of the way. This is what makes the action feel so cool. Each shot I take, I immediately move/lean/crouch out of the way and into position for another shot. When you begin to string together shots and position changes, its an incredible and oddly fluid/graceful feeling.For the price, Holopoint is a pretty fun experience. I experienced no motion sickness, no tracking issues, and had no trouble enjoying the experience. Its a very active game, so prepare to sweat. If you're a fan of the bow and arrow mechanic, I definitely recommend.			",66,21,1,4,16,2,3

												I don't think I've ever written a review for a game before now. However. This game is that good, I feel like it would be a disapoint not to write a game review. -It's the simplest games that are sometimes the best games. The whole mechanic is based around firing arrows at boxes while dodging shots fired at you, with every level becoming more challenging. More boxes. More shots fired at you. Closer boxes. Different enemies. Boss levels! It doesn't seem like there's much to the game play...but that's all you need for an intense 15-30 minute game.-It is a work out. My thighs are killing me, my arms are tired, my core has been worked. I told a friend I felt like I was doing standing up sit ups. My waste has been bent forward and backward more times than I care to count in a ten minute game span. -Videos do not do this game justice. Not...one...bit. If there was a game that needed a demo, it's this one. I almost quit in the first five mintues because I didn't even think the game was polished enough to justify keep playing. I'm glad I didn't quit. -The samurai that attack you.                  They look real. Watch out for them.			",94,31,1,9,27,1,29

												Absolutely recommded for this price!Holopoint is an interactive Bow-Simulator which can be best described as the most real VR work out on the market.The style is between Legolas and Matrix. You shoot with arrows on blue boxes that unfortunately shoot back which requires you to step aside or move your head aside in order not to get shot. Later you will fight again holographic moving enemies.It is very difficult and to be honest in the beginning discouraging. Just try at bit more often. Do not fell the temptation to immediately refund the game.Make sure to play in the morning or at least when you feel yourself fit enough. It is not the sunday hang-over game or the after-work tired lazy gaming experience. Bringing PC gaming and sports together. That's what it is.Highly recommended for the fitter gamers out there or those that want to be fit again after year of lazy seated gaming. Like me. hahah...			",1009,206,30,59,71,3,59

												(HTC Vive) I've played a lot of VR games so far, and this is my favorite. Awesome gameplay, awesome price tag and awesome cardio because you jump around like an idiot (atleast me ^^). Bow and arrow feel pretty natural and after a little confusion in the first 5 minutes ingame everything works out perfectly.Something I liked to have known before playing:    • If you shoot the boxes straight in their center they don't shoot back.   • You can shoot the projectiles that are flying towards you.   • On the right side you can see your lives (scoreboard) as candles.   • Check out the BETA: Steam->Holopoint->Settings->BetaIn case if you are wondering how I made the bulletpoints: ALT -> NUM7 Hardware:   • Asus STRIX R9 390 8GB   • AMD 8350    • 16GB RAM Corsair   • MSI 970 Gaming Motherboard   • No OC Game runs smooth over 90fps (Windows 10).

												After reading about this game in Forbe's I was excited to try it. It's everything that the Forbe's reviewer said it was and more. The graphics are simple, but its their simplicity that makes this game pure and fun. Get ready for a workout as you will be ducking, dodging, and darting. The realisim of reaching behind you to pull an endless amount of arrows out of your quiver is enough to make you truly feel like Legolas or Katniss Everdeen.  Like the Forbe's reviewer, the flaming arrows are a great addition as well as the ability to add your own music if you so desire. This game is a winner especially for the price. A great addition to anyone's game library.			",7,2,0,3,2,0,0

												Fantastic game. The game is pretty straightforward, but there are a few obscure things that aren't pointed out but is not really necessary to know to progress. (Health Counter are a pair of candles on the side of the room, you have 2 lives, and they extinguish as you get hit. Also some targets don't shoot back because you got a perfect shot dead center) There's also a settings menu so you can kind of adjust how the bow operates to your liking. (You can make it fixed to the direction of your bow hand or fixed to your arrow hand when aiming)Some tips: Remember to look up when you don't see any targets. Lower the music audio in the settings (but don't mute everything) because enemies have audio cues as they approach or ready a shot. Use the 3D audio to pinpoint the imminent threat. The bigger the room the easier it'll be, but you can play this game with a medium sized room too. It's a lot of fun, and you end up moving a lot. It has impressed every one of my friends so far. At the end of the day, it's a wave defense game, but it's a really fun one and makes good use of VR.I do wish there was a way to practice boss fights, because I'm pretty stuck on the first one and I think it's because I suck at hitting moving targets of that size.

												Excellent game that could do with a couple of tweaks. I think depending on your room size and how good you are at cable management (you know what I mean) this could be improved with the addition of a few ""options"".If you could choose whether the ""bad guys"" hit back at all, that would change the pace, and allow you to enjoy the game a little more if you dont want that work out.A few other ideas could easily make it more enduring, like different shapes, enemies, etc.The theme of the room is very Matrix, and that could be exploited, plus perhaps a room change or two, maybe user selected.I like this game a lot, recommend it, but dont play it if I dont want to make the headband in my vive sweat, which is a shame as I would play it a lot more if I didnt HAVE to workout to play.Space pirate trainer seems to suffer the same with pacing I find. Easy for ages then suddenly stupidly difficult. Makes me think the developers get bored of working out how to ramp up the difficulty slowly, and do enough to satisfy that initial demand and demo use.			",116,55,9,1,41,6,4

												Honestly, as much as Holopoint is a lot of fun and a really solid way to get in shape, I can't recommend it because the developer does such a bad job supporting it. He seems to patch in two bugs for every bug he fixes, and recently has all but abandoned development for Holopoint (but not before doubling the price).The second half of the game is too difficult to reach and has broken aiming, but with total silence from the dev for three months we can probably assume he's cut and run.

Make sure you're aware of where your headset cord is because ive ripped the power out twice by tripping over it since you go all over the place playing this game, though that cna happen with any intesive room scale game.

												As of writing this I am placed #1 Global Ranking! /bragHolopoint is a terrific little game where you as a floating bow and arrow to face off waves of holographic cubes, samurai and an Ice Queen Wizard of sorts, there's probably another boss at the end level, but I haven't met it, yet.As the adrenaline kicked in and time stops to a crawl, I think to myself in a moment of clarity as shards of the corpses of the holographic enemies  fly by my eyes as I do the ""Matrix Dodge"" while nocking another arrow; this is it. I have become a Neo / Legolas hybrid set in neo-feudal Japan and this is my Dojo. I then span around and promptly almost s*** myself as a samurai was about to take a swing at my face.Is it worth a buy? Yes. It's priced well for what you get.It's challenging, it makes fantastic use of Room Scale VR and it will give a good cardio workout to boot if you really try to become Neogolas. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is now my exercise routine. It's a simple game, where you shoot box targets with a longbow and dodge the counter attack spike sent by most cubes at your vector. I find myself often bending backward, a la Neo, working my core pretty well. Honestly, in later waves you're heart rate is really moving and you may find yourself fighting to remain agile and focused. It's the most fun I've ever had ""working out""... outside of the bedroom, anyway. It also looks quite impressive to your audience when you dodge and weave in a rotating dance of arrow slinging.

												Best VR game I have.  Requires VR to exist, and takes full advantage of room-size VR.  Highly recommend it to anyone.The point of games like this is to trick me, the lazy geek, into exercise.  For that reason, the dodge mechanics become very important.Holopoint requires a fairly significant amount of dodging.  Part of what makes that possible is the single shots coming from bad guys that don't track your movement.  Something shoots, I see it, and move out of the way.  Eventually too many things shoot and I die, but the single shot mechanics ""work"" for me and keep me active. (currently ranked #530 or so... so I don't suck at the game... or there are only 540 people playing:) )Those jerks with the swords are pretty exciting too.  Nothing like turning around and having one of them inside my movement box because I forgot he was sneaking up on me until that point.My only con is the lack of instructions.  I've poked around and couldn't find anything specifically stating how to play.  Its not that difficult, but... Why does a box sometimes not shoot?  (bullseye hit vs not)Why do my arrows sometime start burning?  (No Clue.  Speed of shots?  # of hits in a second?  what?)Do burning arrows DO anything except look cool? (I don't THINK so)Can I dodge the sword swings? (I don't think so, but that would be cool if I could)Can I shoot ANY incoming missile (stars, crap from that one boss, etc?)Does putting my arrow in the way of an incoming missile actually count as an intercept? (seemed like that happened once)As an aside, I wish I could search for ""Room-sized"" ONLY games.  Things that don't have ""standing"" or ""seated"" as options.			",93,16,1,13,16,2,20

												More than worth the $14.99! This is my favorite, and probably most played VR game thus far.  This is the beginning of VR fitness gaming! There are some tame waves but things can get pretty intense. This is a whole body interactive experience and not gonna be easy for the sedentary. But could be a gateway to become more active.  A warning though, if you are not adept at keeping conscious of the cable to the headset in other games,  or want to immerse fully enough to not have to worry about it, you are going to want to find a method to secure it out of the way.See waves 25-29

												Great game that I cant recommmend enough. Other archer games just have you sitting on a platform shooting things below you. Holopoint has you on the ground and in the action.  Most targets you shoot will attempt to shoot back, forcing you to move out of the way while keeping your eye out for more targets. There are bossfights if you can progress far enough and recently they have been adding raids that  include new enemy types, a new boss and a unique bow. At its core it is still a wave shooter but the dodging mechanics are more than enough to keep you entertained and feeling like a badass archer.			",78,24,0,4,10,3,5

												Ah Holopoint. One of the many Archery games for VR. This game is very demanding physically. You will be dodging, ducking, kneeling and weaving all over your play area. Because of this you will end up taking a few breaks in between so don't expect to go even 1 hour straight. All in all, if you want an archery game in VR and don't mind sweating a lot, get this one; especially if its on sale.			",108,33,1,7,23,4,23

												This game is a ton of fun and gets harder and harder as it goes on.  This is the only game Ive played so far that will make you sweat from all the activity.  You start off shooting blocks that shoot back at you, and if you make it to wave 10, samurais start moving toward you and you have to clear them before they get to you - and they come at you in 360 degrees.  Only con so far - The cord is a nuisance at first but you quickly learn to turn each way to compensate for it and then you dont notice it. ",63,14,0,20,17,0,38

												It's a fun game and will definitely get your heart beating if you really get into it. However, I can't recommend it based on the bow mechanics. I find shooting in this game incredibly awkward, especially when comapred to Quivr and The Lab mechanics. The first 10 levels were a ton of fun, but as the difficulty ramps up the poor bow mechanics become a larger and larger nuisance. If this was early access and there was a possiblity of it being improved I would be happy... But it's not and there doesn't appear to be any plans to further optomize it. There are a ton of positive reviews for this game so obviously a lot of people enjoy it. I'd recommend waiting for a sale if you're thinking of buying it.			",219,53,7,25,38,6,69

												Pretty disappointed so far. The bow handling feels terrible compared to games like QuiVR and of course The Lab's Longbow. Even when using the ""two-handed"" setting (and why isn't that the default?) it still feels awful. The motion is delayed and the endpoints don't align with the controllers properly.The haptic feedback is all wrong, too. Again look at Longbow because how they do it makes sense. There should be vibration when you're pulling / slacking the string, but when you're holding it steady there shouldn't be vibration, obviously. This is another small thing that contributes to how ""off"" the whole handling feels.Other than that, I like the shoot / dodge concept.The humanoid enemies drop from the first floor in a very clunky animation.The game just isn't polished, from the basic handling, to the menus, etc etc.			",991,397,39,52,75,8,39

												I absolutely love this game.  Holopoint is probably the best VR archery game at the moment.  Don't get me wrong, Longbow from The Lab is amazing as well and it's hard to beat free but the workout man...  I'm always sweating balls after I'm done with Holopoint.

												Frickin\' awesome game - really my best experience on the VIVE so far! Guys, go buy it, asap! It\'s a blast for this price! But to be fair, you need a bit more than the min. playground. The more the better as you will be moving and turning, ducking, evading & swearing a lot! You also need to already have developed decent \""cable management skill\"" with your feet, if you know what I mean. If you are not used to it I recommend Space Pirate Trainer first, just as an entry lesson, because this game really pushes it to the limit.Thanks dear developers for letting me have this experience! It is mindblowing to feel like Legolas - hell this makes you really feel badass   - I can\'t tell you how happy I\'m with it. Howeverm you may be found guilty of destroying my controllers or my headset - as during hectic action I can only say, \""what the f... is chaperone? - SMACK - OUCH\"" :-)WOW - I just stopped playing for today - and only because my controllers need a recharge :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Holopoint was one of the first games I picked up when my Vive finally arrived.And I have to say it feels amazing! The way you can walk around in your playarea, looking for the appearing enemies, the way you have to get a new arrow by reaching behind your head. You really feel immersed in the game!The blue boxes seem a little bit like a placeholder, but to be honest I never thought about that during the gameplay.Because you need to dodge the shots, it's also a nice little workput ;)If you want to showcase VR a little bit, this is a perfect game. Just drop the people in at level 5 and watch them reach level 10 ;) Or experience the feeling, if you spot an enemy behind your back und you can just turn halfway round and fire there...amazing.Pros:- perfect use of rommscale VR and the vive controllers- nice little workout- engaging highscore systemCon:- additional weapons would be nice- change placeholder graphics for the boxesBe the archer Green Arrow couldn't be this season!

Game is not in early accessWhat is Holopoint?Holopoint is a HTC Vive VR game where you shoot blue cubes with a bow and arrow. Seems simple untill they start shooting back. The idea is that you have eyes in the back of yor head so you can both eliminate cubes for points and avoid cubes shooting at you. When a cube dies it more often than not shoots you, when a cube turns orange it shoots you. How do you avoud these shots? You dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge your way around them. Also there is samurai and ninjas.Is Holopoint good?Holopoint has amassed an impressive 97% positive feedback and with good reason, it is simple but fun. You need no archery skill and it works well even in a relatively small space and for a measly £5 pricetag it is tempting to say no to.For how cheap the game is and for how much fun and exercise you and some friends can get I think that Holopoint is very much worth itIs anything bad?If i'm nitpicking then i'd say that there is no real tutorial and that it was frustrating realising that physical movement is required to progress in this game (which is a lot to ask from a nerd), only other points are perhaps the lack of bow options or any kind of features that would make the game more complex. But I can't really complain for the pricetag.			",297,35,17,25,50,0,45

												Holopoint might be my favorite game for the Vive thus far. Sure, there are some quirks, like the weird position the arrows are in, or the little haptic feedback with the bow. But despite these minor annoyances, Holopoint delivers some incredibly tense fast paced bow and arrow action! I also consider this one of the more physically demanding VR games out there, so don't expect to be able to play this for extended periods of time. Despite my worn out arms, and my sweat soaked vive face gasket, I find myself coming back again and again. For the price, you can't beat the value for the fun you will have.			",190,30,6,23,22,3,29

The shooting, ducking and watchinge for attacks from 360 degrees makes this game both fun and exercise.  It has become the primary place for my exercise routine.			",100,32,3,4,25,2,4

												Seems interesting.  Takes a while to ramp up.  I found my arm was getting tired from being extended out for such a long time while going through the easy waves.  The shoot-then-dodge mechanic is smooth and fun, and certainly gets you moving around.  If the bow mechanics were as good as The Lab Longbow, it would be great.  For now it's just good.  Would recommend Space Pirate Trainer over this at first, but if you're wanting more wave shooter action, this is a solid title with its own quirks and probably worth the price.			",106,11,0,8,8,3,13

												Hands down my favorite VR experience. You get a lot of exercise in this one! It may look lame to someone watching at first, when all you have is cubes to shoot at... but trust me, those cubes are much more intense when you are in the Vive and they are trying to kill you. It's a great game with easy to use controls and great scaling challenge. You will sweat.My only issue I've ever had with this is that sometimes you get the chord a little wrapped around you due to all the spins you need to do to keep your enemies off of you. I also once stepped to dodge and pulled the cord out of the linkbox since it was under tension. Those are easy to avoid problems though as you use it more and get more comfortable with physical limitations of the Vive product. Buy this.			",411,122,1,76,59,4,72

												This is easily the best workout you can have within VR!Like many VR titles, screenies dont sell it. There isnt lots of hidden depth to tell you the truth, but the game knows what its about, and that is pure energy gameplay, and it executes that perfectly.Within minutes (heck, probably a single minute) you will be ducking and leaning as you avoid the projectiles flying at you. Before you know it, your ducking and leaning is joined by spinning and eventually panicking as you advance in levels.

												I love this game. I loved Longbow but it was just a taste. This scratches the VR Archery itch much better. I don't ever write Steam reviews, but this one compelled me to do so. The first time I hit level 10 and the guys started charging at me I was so surprised I was yelling and freaking out. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Does anyone know if there is a way i can switch which trigger fires the bow???????????????? i feel like the trigger button on the remote that holds the arrow would fire the bow... but instead the trigger button on the bow side releases the arrow. i dont think that is the way it should be in my opinion. Can someone please tell me if there is a way to switch it, thanks!			",51,8,2,6,4,2,1

												My Vive has been collecting dust a bit over the past few weeks. I have the lab, job simulator, tilt brush, and fantastic contraption. This is the first game I decided to purchase besides what ever is free on the store. Holy cow this game is mad hectic. I've only played it a few times got to wave 11-12 before my wife came upstairs and told me to knock it out. Aparently I was stopming like a mad man and was going to wake the kids. 11 out of 10 going to lose a few LBs to this one.			",40,7,1,2,5,1,1

												This game is very simple but so engaging. By the time you get to wave 5 or so you'll find yourself in a rythmic batttle dance that will have you running out of breath and trying to remember to breath. I wish the arrow pointed upwards more but it's a small complaint.			",273,104,9,30,26,5,22

												Simple concept, with a great feedback loop that really makes you want to get better. Great value for the amount of fun to be had here. No motion sickness and everything super smooth on a GTX970 here. A couple things I would like to see would be some indication of how many lives you have left. It's not clear to me how many hits you can take and what counts as a hit. Also it would be great to have a score indicator pop out of broken targets to let me know what counts for points. Does shooting the projectiles count for more than shooting the target that emits them?Also, unless I'm mistaken, this doesn't have steam friends-list leaderboards but it totally should. I don't care that I'm 160th in the world, I care that I'm better than my friends.			",641,216,9,64,70,11,92

												Of all the Virtual Reality games I have in my library, this is hands down the favorite of most of the people I know, myself included. The controls are very intuitive... boiling down to simply knocking the arrow with the trigger, drawing, and releasing the arrow by releasing the trigger. Move in room-scale to dip, duck, and lean to avoid enemy fire. The intensity of this game is currently unmatched! You will break a sweat. You will love every second of it. Holopoint is played at the start and end of every VR session. Often times my friends will stop playing a game, after having exhausted it, and come back to holopoint again and again.Gameplay Breakdown:You are in a dojo and your room-scale play area is a mat. You can not leave the matt. Enemies will spawn in 360 degrees around you. You must shoot them with your bow while dodging their counter-fire by dipping, ducking, and moving about your play area. Very simple control scheme and solid bowplay.Pros:+Most solid archery I have played yet.+Hitboxes are perfect.+Nonstop balls to the wall action with a very pleasing difficulty curve.+It's so intuitive you're garunteed to understand it immediately.+Immense replayability.Cons:-I can't really think of anything? Is being too intense a con? It's not a relaxing game. If you have a sports injury or are otherwise disabled this title is probably not for you.-I get tired and can't play this game all day.

												This game is one of the better release titles for the Vive. It's pretty immersive, and takes a bit of practice to get good at (in a good way). The number 1 thing that this game will teach you, which is a lesson that you can take to every single game that you will play on the Vive is this: ""How to avoid tripping on the cables,"" because for this game you're using the 360 degree field of view. Highly recommended.			",601,108,15,61,101,4,77

												Tl;Dr:Probably fun for someone who haven't shot a real bow, but for some who has it's way offI wish I would love this, but I don't. It feels so unatural.I used to shoot at homemade humanlike targets set up in the fields behind my house almost everyday as a teenager. I got custom to shooting the bow and how to do it efficntly. And this games translates it so bad to VR. I kept hitting my Vive a lot in the begining since on a real bow you usually pull the arrow fairly close to your face. This became frustarting fairly quick.when I stopped pulling it towards my face it felt unutural how far to the side I had to pull it. Also my hands felt positioned incorrect no matter how I moved them.I'd like to see an otpion to calibrate, bow postion, string postion, draw hand position according to where the controlers are. The same for the quiver. Since I personally find belt quiver superior to back quiver, and I am not the only one when it comes to that.BUT, the rest of the game seems well fleshed out for an early VR archercy game.This game is probably really fun for people who haven't shot a real bow before or are good at adapting to ""an odd way of shooting a bow""			",209,16,4,15,10,0,7

												Game is clunky and the mechanics are obtuse (which boxes fire back, which do not, where do I monitor my times hit, why did I just get hit three times by one box, etc). Aiming is decent. It doesn't have the same satisfying feel as in The Lab.Add to that it's just a wave shooter for $15.... I can't recommend that.			",56,7,1,6,6,2,10

												This game is okay, but it gets repititive quickly. It also requires you to move a quickly and a *lot*, which is not really practical with current VR tech. I constantly trip over cables from the headset and earphones, or hit myself in the head with the controller while trying to get an arrow from my back. That I have to exit the game every 30 seconds to re-adjust the headset or earphones really takes away from the immersion.			",8,3,0,0,2,1,0

												Using the bow feels unnatural and uncomfortable. You have to angle your bow hand really weirdly to aim properly. If you're hoping this is like archery in the Lab don't bother. The Lab feels much better, more natural, more comfortable. At first I felt like I was missing some point that I should hold the controller weird or something (assuming it must be some gimmick) only to descover this is just a weird design decision the dev seems to have made for some reason...

												TLDR; Game is awesome fun and very physical. 100% immersion, bow position in left hand could be a little better, but is good enough. I recommend purchasing it, $15USD isn't too much for such a neat experience. Bought this game yesterday, and I've only played it about 45 minutes so far. This number *WILL* increase. Firstly this game is rather awesome. I've played maybe 15 VR games, and this one is the first to make me squeal like a little girl. The archery is almost spot on (more on that later), the waves of enemies build up nicely, and there's more variety in oppoents than Space Pirate Trainer for example.The Enemies: First off you start with some harmless looking cubes, which shoot things at you. These aren't too bad, and if you just dodge they seem to go away even if you miss. Then all of the sudden there's so many cubes, all you can think of is ""F*** I hope there's not one behind me!!"" Things calm down for a second when the next enemies are introduced, a swordsman. He doesn't shoot thigns at you and just comes at you with a raised sword. Relentlessly. And before you know it you've now gotta pay attention to where the sword guys are while the cubes fire more missiles at you. It's pandemonium. There are more enemies, and at least one boss, but I'll let you find them. Movement: Takes advantage of roomscale. Enough said really, although I have a roughly 2x2.5m space and I wouldnt want to be playing in any smaller, because have I mentioned that you move. Like a lot, jumping, dodging, weaving (falling over...)  I'd having a guess that this is probabaly the most active game on VR currently, and defintely the most active I've played.Combat: The archery is good, one handed mode is sort of like The Lab, and two handed mode is more how real life is like. Sadly, I wasn't fully happy with the way the controller was mapped to the bow, it feels like you're holding it too low. About 5-10cm (2-4"" for you Americans) too low. You can adjust to this, but I just feel that the archery would be perfect if it was changed a little. Devs, maybe an option to change the grip height on the bow? Overall, this is an awesome game. I love it. If you like the archery in The Lab and games like Space Pirate Trainer, I recommend picking it up.  Performance: On my system this game works really well, and is fairly easy on hardware. My GPU's don't run VR terribly well, but at no point did I experience any desire for more framerate. Note: I haven't tried in single GPU mode, but in every other VR game that I've had performance issues with, one card is better than two. i5 2500k @ 4.6GHz16GB DDR3 RAM @ 1333MHzAMD 7970 GHz edition x2 (Crossfire) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay so I decided to buy this again after refunding it since hearing the bow and arrow were like the lab now. After finding the settings (not obvious) I was able to try it out and it's closer, but not there yet.There are too many small things that stick out as just a little lazy to me and I have trouble looking past these things to just enjoy the game. I do not recommend this currently if little things bother you. I will update my review once I see some of these small things fixed. Like smooth arrow loading like in the lab (it's still not there yet, something feels off.. but I give them credit for trying.) You can't load the arrow into the string without pulling the trigger is what I mean by this. I also did not enjoy having to constantly reach by my ear to grab an arrow and the haptic feedback also did not trick my brain like it did in the lab.The cord gets twisted really fast inis game, so then you have to unwind the Vive after one session.

												Gameplay wise it's excellent but content and option wise, it leaves a lot to be desired. I wouldn't mind it so much if there was actual options to modify the gameplay. Perhaps a more relaxed setting, for the individual who just wants to take down the pace a notch or two. A setting to only have targets appear in one direction, rather than in a 270* arch. Even settings for the size of the target, requiring more precise aim to hit them, stuff like that. For now, it's an extremely basic experience for the price, where you literally can only press start and be thrown into a very stressful experience where you are worn out after 3-4 attempts.So with some more options and variety, it'll be great but right now, it's just too limited and gets boring too easily. However, I won't give it a thumbs down due to the price. It's staying well below the current price-average of most VR games and there's enough fun in the game for the given price. But it could be so much more!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I cannot reccomend this game.I love archery.  There are so many nuances to being a skilled archer, some of which includes leading your targets, accounting for arrow trajectory, and tracking moving objects, but this game has none of that.  You will spend your entire time in a small room firing at stationary targets.  Even the samurais walk directly toward you, so none of the above really comes into play.  This game does not take advantage of any of the mechanics that make archery so cool.The archery module included with the free game ""The Lab"" is a much better archery experience, Come to think of it, I even had more fun with the Wii Sports Resort archery, which included distant and moving targets along with crosswind and bonus objectives.The one thing I did enjoy about this game was the need to move your body to dodge incoming projectiles.  That was fun, but not enough to save this game from a refund.			",136,18,5,9,13,1,4

												As many others have pointed out, the archery feel of this game is somehow off IMO.  Longbow (in ""The Lab"") is far better in my opinion.I would also second that the fast movements required by the game seem at risk of damaging your gear.  Maybe if your VR space setup with a lot of extra space this is not an issue, but for me it was.Lastly, its layout and environment is remarkably drab.  No polish here at all, which I probably wouldn't mind as much if the gameplay were better.			",40,8,0,4,8,2,6

Same level over and over again and requires room scale at least to make it viable (the enemies appear from every direction). Maybe if the game was cheaper, but its not worth 15 $. There are more fun games on the store (The Lab, QuiVR).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, it's just TOO darn difficult and I don't say this lightly. I'm not a master gamer by any means, but I believe I'm slightly better than the average person. I'm also probably fitter than most gamers (no offense to my lesser fit gamers out there=]), but I struggled with the physical demands of the game. I'm all for a challenging game that encourages repeat play, but I find this level of difficulty to be more discouraging than fun.			",29,19,1,12,6,1,11

												In a category already heavily populated, Holopoint delivers intense and sweat-inducing entertainment as promised. However, the gameplay carries a huge design flaw. The jerk reflex that this game requires (and induces due to the nature of VR) is flat out dangerous. If you want a similar (non-harmful) way to work out, go play squash. This is such a major design flaw that I can not recommend this game to anyone.			",45,18,0,7,8,2,13

												I am very conflicted about this game.On the one hand...it is fun as hell.On the other, it requires motions that could possibly damage your equipment. Specifically pulling an arrow from the quiver, and dodging. Let me explain.Normally these actions would not be a big deal. The problem stems from the pace of the game...which is super fast paced and with dodging. First: when you go to pull an arrow from the quiver (on your back) the vive controller tends to clip my headphones (I use over the ear can style 7.1 surround sound...NOT CHEAP headphones!), and since the pace is so fast...I tend to hit them pretty hard violently knocking them from my head. I am worried I will break my vive controler and/or a $200 set of headphones.Second: The enemies shoot back when you hitt hem with an arrow. They do this so quickly that you havbe to move your head VERY fast to dodge the return shot. If you wear large can style headphones like I do, this allmost throws them across the room. Not cool.$8 game vs $200 headset or $1000 VR rig....you decide.TL;DR This game needs to chill a bit out with the action or you will break your headset/VR equipment. Ditch the back quiver and split second return shots. Love the game, hate the motions.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Meh.  This game is boring and not worth $15 to me.  There's no place to practice aiming and getting used to the bow and arrow mechanics without the cubes shooting balls at you right from the start.  There should at least be one room where you can practice shooting before you deal with the blowback.  Additionally, you literally do one thing. Shoot cubes.  The graphics are good and the bow and arrow mechanics are decent, but Holopoint is a one-trick pony and got old really, really fast.			",15,8,0,0,4,1,1

												This archery game gets you shooting at targets, apparently followed by samurai and ninjas, as well as ducking and dodging. It certainly gets you moving. The problem is that it is really difficult.  See video below to get an idea:

												Exhilerating, addicting, and a good price. Too bad you basically NEED a wireless adapter in the higher levels. Constantly turning around rapidly becomes problematic when theres a long cord around your feet. Still, definitely worth the 15$. It's also a GREAT workout that also makes exercising fun.

												This is a fun and intensive game that I really like but the arrow physics is really bad. The way you hold the arrow when you take it is fixed and not like you're really holding it. Not only does this lower the immersion of the game but it also puts a strain on your hand. The bow is also not very good but its fine I guess. I've played another game (quivr) and that game has the arrow in a more realistic way and it feels much better. I really hope that this gets fixed as it is currently not making me enjoy the game even though everything else is great and enjoyable. For now I can not recommend this game.While I didn't mention it yet, the bow is not very well as well done as well but its acceptable. I hope it gets fixed though so one can enjoy this game.If you as a reader do not care about the arrow being fixed and not real-life like then go ahead and play this game since that's the only reason as to why I can not recommend it.

												Summary: Holopoint is a heck of a fun workout. For the overall gameplay it's probably overpriced, but for how fun it is it's a steal. This game will have you running, ducking, and tripping over your cords from the very beginning. For those of you looking for a bit more after playing ""The Lab's Longbow"" this should quench that thirst easily. The new development builds never fail to bring exciting new challenge and variation to the game and I keep hoping for more.Pros:+Simple yet fun+Nice little workout while gaming+Enemy variations and bosses help mixup gameplay+Active and responsive controls+Good difficulty curveCons:-Default settings for the bow are not optimal for most players, be sure to access options right away!-Very basic, may leave players wanting other game modes-Heavily points to the need of wireless VR headsets			",46,15,0,18,11,1,9

												Definitely my favourite VR game yet! At the time of this review, Steam says I have a bit over an hour in the game, which seems weird to me because I definietly feel like its been at least twice that.Anyway, this is very fun! It becomes a lot more than just point and shoot, as the floaty squares shoot projectiles at you when you destroy them, and explode if you leave them for long enough without destroying them. You end up shooting and dodging, and constantly turning to check behind and above you for newly spawned floaty cubes (not really sure what to call them!)Every 5 waves you reach a sort of ""checkpoint"", ie when you die you can restart at that level - but only if you have reached that level at least once before.Once you reach wave 10 the dudes start to spawn. At first they seem less dangerous than the floaty cubes, as they move slowly and dont shoot at you, but I found them harder to hit, and if they reach you it is actually quite terrifying when they swing their sword in your face! It really gives motivation to improve your aim and shoot them before they get too close.This game is not yet perfect - my main complaint would be that the default aim is too low. It takes quite a bit of getting used to - I feel like I need to move my bowstring hand further down than I should just to get the arrow to fire straight and perpendicular to my body. As with almost all VR games at this point, it does feel like it could use a bit more work, but is still incredibly fun as it is at the moment.The constant doding, moving and shooting can get quite tiring. Whilst not especially fit, I'm in OK shape, and I find this game gets me fairly sweaty after playing for a while. I normally need to go take a shower straight after playing! I'm hoping this will help me get a bit fitter though, as it definitely feels like a mini-workout playing this.All in all a very fun game, and I definitely recommend you purchase it - unless, that is, you have the minimum amount of space to play in.This game requires you move around a bit, and initially I only had the minimum area to play in with my Vive, and I feared for my controllers with the amount I was smashing them into things (thankfully they are still fine).Once I managed to upgrade my space into a larger area it becamse a lot easier to play the game.You can still try play it in a tiny space, but its really hard and not too fun, so you might need to give this a miss if you are playing in a tiny space.

												Haven't played for too long yet, and I've only been able to make it to wave 14.  That being said, what a fun, entertaining, and active game!  It requires you to move a LOT, and I very quickly found myself diving, crouching, leaning, and jumping around to dodge the holograms that shoot at you!  Reminds me of something from the hunger games.Pros:-Very active.-Challenging.-Ability to start every 5 waves is awesome.-Difficult, but not TOO difficult to be overly frustrating (yet?)Cons:-Aiming sucks.  Quite frankly, the bow mechanics are terrible!  Something that I think is VERY important in a VR game is that the place you ""grab"" the virtual model should line up with where your hand grabs the controller.  In this game, the handle of the bow floats above where you hold it.  This is bad.  Also, the draw length need to be adjustable! I'm 6' 2"", and  this bow seems like it would be better suited in the hands of somebody that's 5' 2""...  The draw length needs to be adjustable so I don't have to have a bent front arm, and I can draw the arrow all the way back to my face/ear and look down the arrow. As a side note, I do real archery every once in a while.-Not very far in yet, but I'm curious as to how well this will be replayable... A great workout, for sure, but there is no story here.  Shouldn't really be a con, but just something to consider before purchasing.Please fix bow mechanics/model position/etc.That being said, it's a fun game, and once you get into it, the bow mechanics don't bug you that much.  You may never notice if you haven't touched Longbow.			",33,15,1,5,9,2,4

Super responsive, if you've played the bow and arrow mini game in The Lab, expect much much better controls. Feels all too real. Fantastic, buy it now if you're after a game where you fight for a higher score every round and don't mind a good workout!

Now I've got 9 hours of play time and I played this morning as a warm up for a run.  I'm 360 aware even as I simultaneously dodge, pivot, draw, and fire...Katniss has nothing on me (you really feel like such a badass when you play).  Cube far away...get good and you've got time to shoot the cube and the bullet.  This game won't make you into a ninja, but it will make you feel like one...even after you turn it off.

												I have owned this since launch, but feel compelled to review now, as recent updates make it feel like a whole new game again!  This game is a fantastically engaging light cardio workout, that has me coming back to it night after sweaty night.  Aiming, spinning, ducking, and dodging keeps you constantly engaged.Anyone complaining that the game gets repetetive did not take time to get very good at it. New targets, enemies, and boss battles will keep you trying until you can't lift your arms anymore, but you wan't see them until you at least make it to level 10.  Please just do yourself a favour, buy this game and start practicing.  If you make it to level 30 and don't think you've got your money's worth, I will be very VERY surprised.Anyways, I'm going to see if I can make it to level 60 now.  Good luck!

												I was skeptical about this game due to other review saying that the bow handling was bad, but with the recent beta changes, all of that is no longer an issue, But there are a number of problems that turn this otherwise fantastic game into a rather frustrating experience. Way moreso than any other game, I frequently find myself getting tangled up in the cables while playing. This is because most of the targets are placed to your sides and often times they are even behind you, so you have to constantly spin around to find a shot and then need to move forward and backwards to dodge. Compare this to something like Space Pirate Trainer where most of the time you fight enemies in front of you and can spend most of your time dodging left to right. Also, There isnt very much in the way of audio queues to tell you where to look, so you constantly need to whip your head around which frequently causes the headset or headphones to shift around. Lastly, the operation of the bow causes me to constatly smack my controllers or headset into eachother, and my efforts to avoid this cause me to misdraw.That said, I only find all of this stuff so frustrating because it gets in the way of my enjoyment of this otherwise fantastic game. And I will continue to put up with it because The thrill of trying to push your way to the next level while your arms start to ache is too satisfying to give up.			",173,24,6,9,13,3,22

												Holopoint is one of the better VR games out there. It's great fun and makes you feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥Although it is a wave based shooter, I think it's more than a generic wave based shooter solely because of the fact that you have to dodge every backfire that you shoot at. Each increasing wave gets more and more intense. There is a meter up the top of the menu that shows 1 to 25 with milestones for every 5 waves, and I've only managed to get to wave 8. It is so damn intense.If you're looking for a fun workout game, this one's solid.			",434,93,12,32,38,9,38

I did find some minor issues in aiming (two handed) but that might also be due to my inexperience with archery. One complaint I have is that it's pretty easy to get the Vive cables tangled up in your legs and I stepped on my (longish) headphone cord a couple of times causing it to be pulled out. But that's not really the game's fault of course.			",140,35,5,20,23,0,36

												This game is FANTASTIC! I just finished playing for the first time and I am completely blown away by how awesome this is (and how sweaty and tires I am)! There are many other reviews that can tell you how awesome this game is, so I'll just tell you my two complaints: I had a little trouble figuring out the aiming at first and it didn't work quite as well when shooting left handed (the mechanics just felt kind of ""off""). And we need some kind of auto-pause when the cables get yanked out of the break out box (I'd never had trouble with pulling my cables out until I played this). It's super frustrating when you're on a roll and you dodge only to see your screen go black and then by the time you pull your Vive off and look at your monitor you're already dead :(			",187,47,14,11,15,3,13

												If space pirate trainer is the game you get to feel like Neo, this is the game that you get to feel like Legolas. I'll admit, the archery in this game isn't great. It isn't as good as it is in the lab, valve's included game, and it isn't nearly as good as it is in Bowslinger. That being said, I have played, and will play far more of this game than either of those. It's a wave-based shooter set in a dojo, and it is incredibly addicting and a great workout too. Definitely worth a purchase.			",107,30,5,18,41,2,30

												This is the best game in my collection.  I've spent most of my VR time in this game.  It will make you tired and get your blood rate going.  It is also priced well.  It's true that the one-handed bow isn't that realistic, but the dev-build has a two handed one as well if that is your thing.  The one handed bow works well for how frantic the game is in the upper waves.			",31,1,4,4,11,2,4

												A lot of fun. There isn't much to it, really, but that's reflected in the price. I like the fact you *have* to move (or even jump!) around - if it weren't for the HMD, I'd be rolling around on the floor avoiding the incoming missiles. It's also quite challenging, which I like.My one and only gripe is that the arrows seem to come out the quiver at an odd angle (about 90° to the main controller axis). Once knocked they straighten out, but I find it a bit offputting.Also really like the new options!			",65,21,1,8,14,1,11

												I have owned this since launch, but feel compelled to review now, as recent updates make it feel like a whole new game again!  This game is a fantastically engaging light cardio workout, that has me coming back to it night after sweaty night.  Aiming, spinning, ducking, and dodging keeps you constantly engaged.Anyone complaining that the game gets repetetive did not take time to get very good at it. New targets, enemies, and boss battles will keep you trying until you can't lift your arms anymore, but you wan't see them until you at least make it to level 10.  Please just do yourself a favour, buy this game and start practicing.  If you make it to level 30 and don't think you've got your money's worth, I will be very VERY surprised.Anyways, I'm going to see if I can make it to level 60 now.  Good luck!

												This is one of my favourite VR games, it's so simple yet fun and gives you a great workout. You get a great sense of satisfaction when you shoot and dodge 5 enemies in a row. I'm yet to see if the game can hold my attention for many more hours.There needs to be a bit more variation in the music as its gets very repetative and also one of the songs has a section that sounds exactly the same as the noise the enemies make when they shoot you so I find myself turning round to look for an enemy that isn't there.It was also a bit over priced for the simplicity of development. For example the main map is the dojo which is an open source 3d map. It would be nicer if they developed their own maps for a bit of variety.			",14,7,1,0,3,1,0

												This is currently my favorite Vive title.  At first I thought it was dull, but that was pre-level 10 when I was only shooting stationary cubes.  Now that I'm up to 27 it's a whole different experience.  I literally feel like a 日本の射手 (nihon no ite -> japanese archer) practicing 弓道 (kyudo -> ""way of the bow"") in my own personal dojo.  My only complaints are that the samurai become invulnerable once they begin their attack animation, and their attack is a high swipe so it looks like it should be dodge-able.  The only bug I've experienced is occasionally my arrow will shoot horizontally and do no damage (maybe I'm pulling too sloppy?), and occasionally the start cube doesn't activate when firing on it.  This game is very similar to Space Pirate Trainer, except there's more diversity in enemy types at the expense of less diversity in attack options.  I also think it's really cool that your arrows start flaming when you get a consecutive hit streak going, although I'm not sure if it changes anything other than visuals.  If you have a Vive, and you enjoy archery then I strongly recommend picking up this game!			",401,111,8,86,59,6,95

												The Lab's Longbow demo got me wanting more VR bow goodness, and Holopoint more than fulfilled that craving. This game has gone straight to the top of my list of Vive launch titles. The difficulty ramp is perfect so far (just hit wave 16, I think) - changing things up just enough as time goes by to keep you pressured (and to get you moving enough to get your heart rate up!), without feeling unfair. I expect that I have a long ways to go before I'm good enough to see all this game has to offer, but I don't plan on stopping any time soon.I will admit that I'm not sure how this game would play in a tight space - I have about 2.5x2.5 meters and feel like I use it all, but you could probably get away with less with more ducking.The only problem I have had with the game is one built-in to the Vive - I recently died because I stepped on my cable and lost USB connection to the computer from the linkbox. Whoops. Try not to make my mistake, and also watch out that you don't spin the same way too many times and get wrapped up in your cable either.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The most fun game you can get for the Vive today. You wouldn't think that what is basically an archery game would be that good but the developers have made the game even more fun by having some targets shoot at you (making you dodge shots) as well as later enemies charging you. By playing in a full 360 degree environment you do find yourself spinning around a lot to look for (and to shoot) opponents which keeps you very active.Protip for anyone playing - you can shoot the shots/shirukens that get fired at you if you're quick enough!

												After awhile in 'The Lab - Longbow' I end up seeking for something more with archery. I can say Holopoint is a perfect archery VR game to start off with. Especially with that price, you couldn't ask for more!When I first started out, I had expected the standing targets would simply vanish. They don't. Each standing target will fire back at you once killed. When I progressed further I experienced new targets. Moving toward me to slice my head. Encountered a rare few targets that threw shirukens at me in incredible speed.The boss battle is exciting to keep you moving and dodging around her shots and have to aim carefully to her weakpoint.Pro:-Beginning waves give you good understanding of game mechanics.-Sharpens reflexes, reaction speed, awareness (highly recommend headphones)-Mid to High waves will keep you under pressure of overwhelming targets-Rewards your slight of hand and streak kills (without missing) with fire arrows-Option to start differnet waves by 5. (Max option is the 25th Wave)-Lot of replayabilty     -Global Leaderboard to push yourself furtherCons:Warning for players that love to move around:-I have smacked my controllers together a few times. Under pressure of massive targets.-Hit my VR twice to pull my arrows quickly from my quiver.-After awhile, realize targets have specific spawns in each wave-Some panic / spook moments of target right next to you when you turn.-Can't really hear each footsteps distance, only the floors creak and armor rattling.-Don't play too long or else feel the sweat on your VR sweatpads for an hour to dry up.

												Holopoint gets me excited for a number of reasons, the least of which is how freaking amazing the game itself is. Don't get me wrong, I think this is one of the best bang-for-your-buck experiences in the early days of the Vive. If I tried this thing in an arcade one afternoon, I'd be spending well over seven bucks to play it as much as I have (and intend to going forward).What REALLY gets me excited is thinking about where developers are going to take this concept, and how far they intend to run with it. A bit more variety in environments, enemies and control style (as well as some polish on how to work the bow) would make a game like this a truly killer app for the Vive. Even in its current state, I would call it a top 5 release title from what is becoming a quite sizable early batch of VR titles.			",234,87,3,28,41,2,10

												This is a very fun archery game for the Vive! If you played ""Longbow"" in ""The Lab"" you know what you're getting into. It's waves of static or moving enemies you have to shoot. The things you shoot can shoot back and you have to evade. This little thing changes the game so much! It makes you feel like a (now very much sweating) Ninja Archer!The controls feel very good and tight and can be customized (can be set to behave the same as in ""The Lab"").Difficulty-wise it's very challenging and can feel overwhelming (i'm currently stuck on Wave 14). If you die you can start at a checkpoint which is created after every 5 levels.I'm usually not much for wave-based games but i'm coming back for this game over and over again.Negative stuff:- No Tutorial (I have no idea what fire arrows are and how to get them)- No ability to skip levels altogether (i have no idea what the outside looks like)- The Vive cords get tangled up a lot			",250,84,6,42,30,5,50

												You duck, you dodge, you draw, you lean to the side to avoid a bullet, you shoot. It's becoming frantic, they're getting close. You're going so fast your arrows have literally lit on fire. You're hot and sweating, you're almost to the end of the wave. And then, as you pivot to take out a humming square that's about to shoot, your Vive's power connector yanks out of the box because you've been spinning around so much that the tether is all twisted. You lost.That was my biggest enemy in this game, stepping on the cord, getting the cord tangled, unplugging the cord because all the slack was taken up by twists. Even my earbuds managed to get caught and pull out of my ears once. The game is fantastic, it's one of my favorite experiences so far. But it really shows off the limitations of the Vive's cabling. Maybe it's just me, maybe other people have a pulley or something to keep things organized.But in the first twenty minutes of any session, when there's slack in the cord and you're not sweaty, it's a ludicrously fun game. A few other games have ""dodge"" mechanics like this, but those other games make your hitbox so large that you can't dodge all that well (they have block mechanics too, usually). This one has no block, you can only dodge; and the dodging is very precise - you only need to move your head half a foot to the left and a bullet will miss you. It feels right, it's satisfying, and it's worth the experience.			",214,33,1,23,31,1,18

												This is a really fun game,  The pace can be very fast and it makes for an awesome experience.  This game gets me moving more than any others on the Vive so far.  After a good round of Holopoint I am usually out of breath and sweating.  Fun to play in rotation with groups too.			",101,14,0,4,21,1,7

												OMG.  I haven't written any reviews for VR games yet, but I feel the need to write a review for this one.  I consider myself reasonably fit, but I was sweating buckets after playing this game.  It is fantastic as a workout.  It's incredibly fun and addictive, easy to get to grips with and it has you jumping around like a maniac.  One addition I would like to see (apologies if I missed it) is the ability to use your own music from your music library.  I will definitely be playing this game regularly and I hope to see more games like this that get people moving and sweating.  Maybe a boxing game next please? :-)			",41,11,7,9,8,0,0

A couple of good games later and im knackered.Just watch out for the cable when it gets coiled up from turning so much! I thought i broke my Vive entirely by stepping on it mid game resulting in the right eye bugging out... so yeh word of advice, turn equally left and right to protect your Vive.

												[Played dev build 3.0.0] Excelled workout routine! The constant shooting and ducking and turning makes this an great way to spend some calories and it's a real blast to play too. I did find some minor issues in aiming (two handed) but that might also be due to my inexperience with archery. One complaint I have is that it's pretty easy to get the Vive cables tangled up in your legs and I stepped on my (longish) headphone cord a couple of times causing it to be pulled out. But that's not really the game's fault of course.			",140,35,5,20,23,0,36

This is the only game that makes me tear out the cord, and it puts a smile on my face every time lol.  This is also the only VR game I can wholeheartedly recommend for people looking to get in better shape.  It will make your legs and core stronger-especially if you play it while also taking some time to walk or run outside.  It is very well optimized and polished and very fun.  It is a must have for anyone interested in ""active VR"".			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the better Vive games out there right now, for the simple fact that you have to move so much in it.Once you're past level 7ish it's non-stop shooting, turning, ducking, and matrix-like avoidence manuevers.  Very fun, and really get's you in that ""flow state"" where the only thing on your mind is what you're doing right now.  The difficulty seems to be progressing at a good rate (currently working on getting to level 15) as they introduce new targets that move and attack in more challenging ways. Would reccoment to anyone with a Vive.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Holopoint is a simple concept executed well. Since buying the HTC Vive, this is the only game I keep coming back to. It's fun and is a real workout, especially at the later levels.Another bonus is the progression, it starts easy and gets more and more difficult as you move through which means anyone can pick up this game and get on reasonably well.I've played multiple shooting range games and the 360° environment, coupled with the fast paced music make this a much greater experience. The game doesn't offer much in the way of variation or configuration but it doesn't need to, it's main charm is the challenge - how many waves can you survive this time?Overall this is my favourite VR game, I keep coming back to play it and it's the first thing I show people that come round to try out VR.

												For the price it's a must-have game. I don't play it all that much, but I always come to it whenever I want a high activity game. This game makes you move the most out of anything else available right now.You're forced to make bow shooting movements while dodging return projectiles. This forces you to move both your arms and the rest of your body.If you get this game, I recommend being somewhat mindful of the cable, and try to adopt a scanning method that has you turning in different directions to minimize twisting / kinking of the vive cable. This game will make it happen more than anything else, due to the nature of the targets presenting all around you.			",131,39,1,12,13,3,15

												You can expect pure adrenaline from a feeling of total immersion as you do increasingly more at once, from shooting arrows to dodging projectiles aimed right at your head to looking out for incoming ninjas. Don't underestimate the difference a 360 degree threat makes when it comes to effort involved. You literally have to turn around as fast as you can constantly. Suddenly you'll hear a pulse sound growing more intense, as you frantically try and find out which direction it's coming from. You turn around and look up, only to have a projectile hit you right in the face - or dodge it just in time if you're lucky.And all of this is non-stop, escalating in intensity with every level.Really, this has GOT to be one of the most enjoyable ways to combine gaming and cardio, and it's definitely worth the asking price!

I like the fact you *have* to move (or even jump!) around - if it weren't for the HMD, I'd be rolling around on the floor avoiding the incoming missiles. It's also quite challenging, which I like.My one and only gripe is that the arrows seem to come out the quiver at an odd angle (about 90° to the main controller axis). Once knocked they straighten out, but I find it a bit offputting.Also really like the new options!			",65,21,1,8,14,1,11

												After awhile in 'The Lab - Longbow' I end up seeking for something more with archery. I can say Holopoint is a perfect archery VR game to start off with. Especially with that price, you couldn't ask for more!When I first started out, I had expected the standing targets would simply vanish. They don't. Each standing target will fire back at you once killed. When I progressed further I experienced new targets. Moving toward me to slice my head. Encountered a rare few targets that threw shirukens at me in incredible speed.The boss battle is exciting to keep you moving and dodging around her shots and have to aim carefully to her weakpoint.Pro:-Beginning waves give you good understanding of game mechanics.-Sharpens reflexes, reaction speed, awareness (highly recommend headphones)-Mid to High waves will keep you under pressure of overwhelming targets-Rewards your slight of hand and streak kills (without missing) with fire arrows-Option to start differnet waves by 5. (Max option is the 25th Wave)-Lot of replayabilty     -Global Leaderboard to push yourself furtherCons:Warning for players that love to move around:-I have smacked my controllers together a few times. Under pressure of massive targets.-Hit my VR twice to pull my arrows quickly from my quiver.-After awhile, realize targets have specific spawns in each wave-Some panic / spook moments of target right next to you when you turn.-Can't really hear each footsteps distance, only the floors creak and armor rattling.-Don't play too long or else feel the sweat on your VR sweatpads for an hour to dry up.

												Holopoint gets me excited for a number of reasons, the least of which is how freaking amazing the game itself is. Don't get me wrong, I think this is one of the best bang-for-your-buck experiences in the early days of the Vive. If I tried this thing in an arcade one afternoon, I'd be spending well over seven bucks to play it as much as I have (and intend to going forward).What REALLY gets me excited is thinking about where developers are going to take this concept, and how far they intend to run with it. A bit more variety in environments, enemies and control style (as well as some polish on how to work the bow) would make a game like this a truly killer app for the Vive. Even in its current state, I would call it a top 5 release title from what is becoming a quite sizable early batch of VR titles.			",234,87,3,28,41,2,10

												This is a fantastic game.  I would make two recomendations:1. The arrow position is wierd for me. You should give me the option to use the trackpad to change the angle at which I'm holding the arrow. You're not doing anything with it right now anyways, and not everyone likes to hold their arrows the same. Maybe having to hold the grip at the same time so people are less likely to do it on accident. 2. The shaking in between rounds is pushing the border of making me sick. Anything with shakiness in it like that it's super great in VR. Just something to think about.  Other than those two things though, I feel like ♥♥♥♥ing Arrow. Shooting and strafing and dodging and just all around being a ♥♥♥♥ing badass.  Great game.			",159,22,6,9,25,0,9

												When the game first loads it warns ""Due to the intensity of this game""...now the rest is a general health warning, but they choose their words well for it is a warning to all! Holopoint is a simple wave based shooter with no pause button and intense music (albeit the same song over and over, but a good beat). The arrow physics are not the best but damn good and the hapatic feedback ont he controls allows you to easily nock arrows aim and shoot with ever increasing instict, which in my opinion is needed. Nock and shoot fast enough and you can also hit the things that your targets shoot back at you. 1 part Kattness Everdean training1 part Neo dodging simulator1 part jump rope with you vive cable 8//10 would (and will) fling myself into the wall again!(seriously reccommend unplugging the vive after your done and straightening the cable.)

												Holopoint is a fun game, but unfortunately the amount of spinning the game requires you do is somewhat counter-intuitive with the cord setup on the HTC Vive, and honestly the bow feels significantly less satisfying to use than the one offered in The Lab. With a little practice and some patience, it feels like this title could pay off.			",371,51,13,25,27,4,36

												AMAZING WORKOUT! I really love this game and it is getting me in shape :) I just posted a YouTube video that I had to conclude earlier than I wanted to because I could no longer lift the controllers XD This game is a lot of fun and they are still adding content, I highly recommend it. Here is that video I mentioned above. I got a couple waves into Chōyaku's encounter (The last boss of the original content)... TOUGH FIGHT!! By the end I ranked #336 with over 30k and could barely lift the vive controllers XD. Check it out:

												fun game, its a bit of exercise whilst not being boring like most exercise is. it may not keep interest for months and months as its basically a shooting gallery with some dodging, but it is addicting and its fun to try and beat your high score. the graphics are functional and give off a matrix/martial arts zen vibe, the music gets a bit repetitive so i stick on some off favourite tunes in background and this seems to get me in 'the zone'. decent price for what you get and if your only going to get a few games for the vive id recommend this.but be warned this is not a spawling epic rpg and is best played in short 1-2 hour bursts, hopefully this sort of game will be an accompliment to bigger more diverse games in the future.

												Great game, highly recommended. Be prepared to sweat, you might want to take a shower after playing this game for more than five minutes. Also, you should have at least minimal space to move around - if you intend to play this just sitting or standing, you'll probably get killed off in no time. This game really shines when you're doing semi-acrobatic movements, fluidly dodging a shot while nocking another arrow, shoot from a kneeling position, rise up again while turning around and nocking another arrow to then shoot an approaching enemy that were closing in behind your back. You'll feel like a badass.As a side note, I don't know if there's a backstory of any kind, but for me it's a haunted dojo in feudal Japan where you fight of the ghosts of samurais and ninjas etc.			",33,17,0,4,7,1,0

												You can expect pure adrenaline from a feeling of total immersion as you do increasingly more at once, from shooting arrows to dodging projectiles aimed right at your head to looking out for incoming ninjas. Don't underestimate the difference a 360 degree threat makes when it comes to effort involved. You literally have to turn around as fast as you can constantly. Suddenly you'll hear a pulse sound growing more intense, as you frantically try and find out which direction it's coming from. You turn around and look up, only to have a projectile hit you right in the face - or dodge it just in time if you're lucky.And all of this is non-stop, escalating in intensity with every level.Really, this has GOT to be one of the most enjoyable ways to combine gaming and cardio, and it's definitely worth the asking price!

Shooting arrows while ducking and weaving to avoid projectiles makes the game feel like a scene out of an action movie. Holopoint demands concentration and always keeps you moving. It is fast paced, pure arcade fun. I can honestly say that this is one of the most engrossing games I have played in the past 10 years. Highly recommend for anyone with a Vive.

												Holopoint is a fun game, but unfortunately the amount of spinning the game requires you do is somewhat counter-intuitive with the cord setup on the HTC Vive, and honestly the bow feels significantly less satisfying to use than the one offered in The Lab. With a little practice and some patience, it feels like this title could pay off.			",371,51,13,25,27,4,36

												By far the most active VR game I have played yet, thought it looked kind of janky when I first saw gameplay footage of it but it is so much fun. Graphics are clear, mechanics are great, and has an amazing replayability factor. This is one that I keep coming back to.			",46,22,2,1,12,1,2

												My favorite VR title so far, I keep coming back to Holopoint to see how far I can get! It's extremely fun, and good exercise as well. You'll need a decent amount of space to play in, as the game will have you dodging around a lot. I love to demo this game, and people always seem to enjoy it.I look forwards to more updates from the devs. It could use more variety in environments &  enemy types, and it would be cool if the game offered other bow models.

												This is a very fun archery game for the Vive! If you played ""Longbow"" in ""The Lab"" you know what you're getting into. It's waves of static or moving enemies you have to shoot. The things you shoot can shoot back and you have to evade. This little thing changes the game so much! It makes you feel like a (now very much sweating) Ninja Archer!The controls feel very good and tight and can be customized (can be set to behave the same as in ""The Lab"").Difficulty-wise it's very challenging and can feel overwhelming (i'm currently stuck on Wave 14). If you die you can start at a checkpoint which is created after every 5 levels.I'm usually not much for wave-based games but i'm coming back for this game over and over again.Negative stuff:- No Tutorial (I have no idea what fire arrows are and how to get them)- No ability to skip levels altogether (i have no idea what the outside looks like)- The Vive cords get tangled up a lot			",250,84,6,42,30,5,50

												You duck, you dodge, you draw, you lean to the side to avoid a bullet, you shoot. It's becoming frantic, they're getting close. You're going so fast your arrows have literally lit on fire. You're hot and sweating, you're almost to the end of the wave. And then, as you pivot to take out a humming square that's about to shoot, your Vive's power connector yanks out of the box because you've been spinning around so much that the tether is all twisted. You lost.That was my biggest enemy in this game, stepping on the cord, getting the cord tangled, unplugging the cord because all the slack was taken up by twists. Even my earbuds managed to get caught and pull out of my ears once. The game is fantastic, it's one of my favorite experiences so far. But it really shows off the limitations of the Vive's cabling. Maybe it's just me, maybe other people have a pulley or something to keep things organized.But in the first twenty minutes of any session, when there's slack in the cord and you're not sweaty, it's a ludicrously fun game. A few other games have ""dodge"" mechanics like this, but those other games make your hitbox so large that you can't dodge all that well (they have block mechanics too, usually). This one has no block, you can only dodge; and the dodging is very precise - you only need to move your head half a foot to the left and a bullet will miss you. It feels right, it's satisfying, and it's worth the experience.			",214,33,1,23,31,1,18

												This game is a lot of fun to play, and quite addicting. I was expecting a sort of The Lab Longbow kind of bow remake sort of game, but damn, this is NOT that. I bought it without looking at it at all, only hearing that it was good. I got up to level 15 at this point and I feel like a freakin ninja playing this game. I get really caught up in my Vive's cable tether though. I've had it wrapped around my foot several times while I scramble trying to shake loose while still shooting things haha. Adds a whole other level of difficulty!			",133,20,1,17,8,1,7

												I originally gave this a bad review, but after several updates and a second view I'm deciding to change my vote to positive. If you are looking for reasons to buy this game, look at the other positive reviews; I'm just going to focus on the negatives.First, waves 1-10 can be tedious. I don't know if you can skip them at the begining since I've gotten far past them since, but if you happen to lose on, say, wave 9, you have to back track and redo some of the tedium. It can get frustrating fighting the same 'responsive' cube over and over again.  It'd be better if there was something else to hook the player's attention in these first few waves.Second, the point system in this game is hard to decipher. Its there, and there are leaderboards, but the best way to get points is a mystery. All it really needs to fix this issue is to have some sort of score pop-up after you destroy an enemy.My negatives are small though, and this game is definitely fun if your looking for an dedicated archery game outside of the Lab's archery.

												An extremely fun and challenging arcade style wave survival game, highly recommended!  Warning, you WILL work up a sweat.Pros:-Slaughter cubes and samurai that assault you from all direction, and even from straight above you!-Cubes have like a 90% chance shoot back upon death which is a nice touch, it keeps you on your toes-You will get a work out guaranteed-Eventually you will become very good at pinpointing the enemies and fragging them, it feels really badass-Plenty of levels to beat/unlock with a global leaderboard system-Devs are regularly updating the game, it's a purchase I feel really good about making-$15 feels just about right for the quality of the game and the frequent updates.  I got it 50% off as an early adopter which in retrospect was an absolute stealCons:-You will get sweaty, take breaks and perhaps get a VRCover-A slower practice/relaxing mode would be nice for days when I don't want to work my♥♥♥♥♥off-Graphics are pretty lackluster, come in with low expectationsOther:-With a good shot, you can hit the projectiles that the cubes fire at you			",169,22,15,10,13,1,9

												[Played dev build 3.0.0] Excelled workout routine! The constant shooting and ducking and turning makes this an great way to spend some calories and it's a real blast to play too. I did find some minor issues in aiming (two handed) but that might also be due to my inexperience with archery. One complaint I have is that it's pretty easy to get the Vive cables tangled up in your legs and I stepped on my (longish) headphone cord a couple of times causing it to be pulled out. But that's not really the game's fault of course.			",140,35,5,20,23,0,36

												I get into a great flow when playing this game. It's my favourite game for the Vive and the one I play the most. It's also a great workout, I always feel really good when I have the time to play it for half an hour in the morning. Have had some small issues with slowdowns and lost tracking, but only like 1% of the time in one out of five games. 9/10 highly recommended.The gameplay is simple, you stand in a room and shoot stuff at the same time as dodging projectiles that are spawned from the things you shoot (or thrown, or spawned if you're to slow at shooting something). I recommend the setting that lets you control the bow with both hands, feels more realistic and is a better workout. Try really getting into it and pretend it's a real bow, bend your legs and you'll feel like a Samurai :)It's pretty easy to tangle the cord to your HMD after spinning around alot, a tip is to try and return to a ""base position"" facing the same direction after every move, sort of like when playing tennis or squash.

												This is one of the better Vive games out there right now, for the simple fact that you have to move so much in it.Once you're past level 7ish it's non-stop shooting, turning, ducking, and matrix-like avoidence manuevers.  Very fun, and really get's you in that ""flow state"" where the only thing on your mind is what you're doing right now.  The difficulty seems to be progressing at a good rate (currently working on getting to level 15) as they introduce new targets that move and attack in more challenging ways. Would reccoment to anyone with a Vive.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I do not think I have sweat so much while in the Vive!  Holopoint is definitely not for those looking for a relaxing virtual reality experience.  What it does offer, is a fast paced archery arcade game that tests your reflexes and endurance.  While it left me with several rug burns from avoiding all the projectiles, I would have to give the game a thumbs up.  I would definitely put it at a lower price for the amount of content in the game though.  If it comes on sale, I would definitely buy it.			",82,17,2,13,11,2,5

												Excellent cardio workout. You are forced to take a step sideways after every shot, so it gets your feet shuffling at the start and has you dodging bullets like Neo near the end.If you've wanted to feel like Legolas or the archer girl in Hunger Games (sorry HG fans) then this is the training you need. I'd recommend shooting the wall fixtures for a while to gain accuracy before you start the game.Surround sound headphones are a great help to staying alive in later levels.Hours (days) of game play for your dollars. Highly recommended.			",31,16,4,1,15,1,2

												Haven't played for too long yet, and I've only been able to make it to wave 14.  That being said, what a fun, entertaining, and active game!  It requires you to move a LOT, and I very quickly found myself diving, crouching, leaning, and jumping around to dodge the holograms that shoot at you!  Reminds me of something from the hunger games.Pros:-Very active.-Challenging.-Ability to start every 5 waves is awesome.-Difficult, but not TOO difficult to be overly frustrating (yet?)Cons:-Aiming sucks.  Quite frankly, the bow mechanics are terrible!  Something that I think is VERY important in a VR game is that the place you ""grab"" the virtual model should line up with where your hand grabs the controller.  In this game, the handle of the bow floats above where you hold it.  This is bad.  Also, the draw length need to be adjustable! I'm 6' 2"", and  this bow seems like it would be better suited in the hands of somebody that's 5' 2""...  The draw length needs to be adjustable so I don't have to have a bent front arm, and I can draw the arrow all the way back to my face/ear and look down the arrow. As a side note, I do real archery every once in a while.-Not very far in yet, but I'm curious as to how well this will be replayable... A great workout, for sure, but there is no story here.  Shouldn't really be a con, but just something to consider before purchasing.Please fix bow mechanics/model position/etc.That being said, it's a fun game, and once you get into it, the bow mechanics don't bug you that much.  You may never notice if you haven't touched Longbow.			",33,15,1,5,9,2,4

												A real workout!Also, there's nothing scarier in any VR game than wrecking house only to turn around to a knight mid-slash.			",268,46,3,10,17,4,16
