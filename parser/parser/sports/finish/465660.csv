												Even though it is officially licensed by the NHL, it doesn't have all the rules. In example, you are limited to a roster size of 23 players during preseason. Until basics like that is fixed, I can't recommend this game.More examples:Olympic break is not long enough. NHL season resumes before the Olympics are over. Submitting contracts is a bit wonky. For example, if you submit a entry level contract offer to a kid you've drafted, he will come back and say stuff like ""I'd be happy to play for your team at these terms. But first let me see if there are any other teams interested in my services, before I sign. I'll be in touch."" Sorry kid, this is the NHL and here we have rights. My team is the only team that can sign you. You are not allowed to talk to any other teams.Another thing about contracts, I traded for Trouba, who is an RFA. I met his demands, asked for response and submitted my offer. A couple of days went by, and he came back and said he was going to sign for me if he didn't receive any better deals. Being an RFA, it's not very likely another team would give him an offer sheet, considering what they would have to give up to sign him. However, it's not 100% unlikely, so I withdrew my offer, and was going to give him a better offer, but now he doesn't want to sign, let alone talk to me. ...Which brings me to this. There has got to be a way to talk to players in a game like this. Look at EHM or FM(!) series. Draft lottery rules are wrong. The top three top draft picks are part of the lottery. Not in the game, but not really a game breaker either. Trades should not be limited to five players/draft picks for each team.The UI is not the best. Now, it could come down to me being used to the UI of EHM, but it's surely not the sole reason of why I am not thrilled with the UI. A few examples.*Inbox screen, why isn't there a ""read next unread button""? Instead of this, I have to click on ever item. *An option for saving different line and strategy setups is lacking. This should be a high priority, in my opinion as it is very time consuming the way it is now.*There should be an option where the assistant GM just fills out the rest of the line up instead of only rearranging every player.

												A great game needs a great villan. In FHM 3 that great villian is Jarmo ""The Butcher"" Kekalainen, General Manager of the Columbus Blue Jackets and low-down traiterous F*#$ing swine! You see, having never played a game like this one I decided to work my way up. I started with no job and accepted the position of General Manager of the Cleveland Monsters, assuming Cleveland was a low as a man can start. It apperared to be good job. Playing with the awesome tools at my disposal I spend the first hour assembling my roster into elite and dangerous line changes. Satisified, I advance a few days. Suddenly an email pops up telling me that, argueably the best player on the team has been called up. Dammit, says I. I'll have to spend another few minutes tinkering. So I tinker away and right the wrong done to my team. I advance another day, and not 1, not 2, but 5 players are called up. Now for a persnickety fellow like myself this sets my♥♥♥♥♥♥to clinching. Deep breaths are taken. But, downing a beer, I decide to wait until just a few days before my first game to edit the line up again, lest it become broken by more call ups. Then it happens. Both of my Goalies are called up. Now, Im not sure how deep your knowledge of Hockey runs, but I can tell you that, that position is somewhat important. Another beer goes down. I recruit the best goalie on the market. I assume he was recruited using a local add in the classifieds next to the guy selling an old ridiculous large aquarium and the lady selling Yorkie-poo's, because he has exactly half a star of talent, and one  whole star of potential.It is at this moment I wonder why this is happening. Im not an evil man. I don't beat my kids nor do I call my fellow man, ""bro"". I try to do good in the world. I like to leave large tips and ridiculously long reviews for the products that I enjoy. Why is this happening?Then I found my answer. Jarmo Kekalainen the Columbus Blue Jackets GM was f*&%ing with me. How do I know he was just f^$%ing around. Because after over paying the leagues least talented goalie and updating my line ups two day before the game, this son of ♥♥♥♥♥ sends 3 of the 6 called up players back. Only now each one of them is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥the F*^$ off that his dreams of NHL glory were crushed and the take no solace is returning to the stately metropolis of Cleveland. So now I have some talent back, but said tallent does want to be there.My first loss is lopsided to say the least. It looks like the score of and NFL football game. I decide that I am not going to let this bring me down. I trade away all of my talented unhappy players for a goalie that isn't incompetent and 1 decent right winger. I win the next two preseason game and God Damn Mother F*&^ing Jarmo takes my God Damn Mother  F*&^ing Goalie. He is kind enough to send back one of the ones he took. But that poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is, of course, no longer satisfied with his lot as a Cleveland Monster and does, in fact, lose the next two games. So I have come to a decision. I will crush Jarmo. I am going to turn this nightmare in Cleveland around and get promoted to the NHL. And eventually I am going to replace his sorry♥♥♥♥♥in Columbus. Ill take the NHL's tiniest salary if I have to, but I will unmake everything that he has made. I will see him and his family on the streets. If he takes another job, Ill go and take that one too. He tasks me. He tasks me and I shall have him! I'll chase him 'round the moons of Nibia and 'round the Antares Maelstrom and 'round perdition's flames before I give him up! 11/10 Would make a nemeisis again.PS. To the developer. That litte crown on the icon for guy with a coaching advantage...that...I have strong opinions about that...***11/19/2016 Update****HAHAHAAHAHA!!!! In the year 2023 The Columbus Blue Jackets finished 29th as I trimphantly lead the Florida Panthers to their second Stanley Cup. The fans waited anxiously for their beloved GM to accept a contract exension, but nay, I SAY NAY! He did not. He accepted the postion of GM and Head Coach of the Columbus Blue Jackets as the Blue Jacks abandoned  Mother ♥♥♥♥ing Jarmo like a pregnant prom date.. Why would the NHL's Top GM do such a thing? Because back when he managed the Cleveland Monsters Jarmo stuck it to his team without even sending over some KY to smooth things over. Here is where I will build my dynasty! But first, I'm calling up every player on the Cleveland Monster that might even almost be viable...because...I can! I love this game!I would also like address some the negative reviews posted here. If you are considering buying this game, you absolutely should. I have had 3 game breaking errors since I started playing. I literally could play no more and within a few hours of posting the error on the developer site they were fixed. The developer is VERY invested in this game and many of the negative issues that are being brought up can, have been, or will be corrected. While they are pubished by the same company that does OOTP Baseball, it a completely different team that made this game. I have had nothing but positive experiences here. And no I do not work for them. I post as Jubal Early on thier forums too, you will see me there.			",63,22,1,18,12,0,9

Product received for free
IntroductionFranchise Hockey Manager 3 is developed and published by Out of the Park Developments. They seem to specialize on making sports management simulators such as the much better, Out of the Park Baseball 17. And I would have to be Out of My Mind to spend nearly 40 dollars on the “masterpiece” I’m about to present to you. GameplayI haven't had this much fun since decorating my house. In fact, watching paint dry would probably make for a better review subject. Before you dismiss my unabashed opinion of this title as simply another review writing geek hating on sports games, I’ll have you know that my love affair with the ice rink goes back quite a few years. Now, that does not mean I was ever a professional ice skater or hockey player, but I wasn’t clueless about it either. To my major disappointment, Franchise Hockey Manager 3 is far worse than any cheap football manager I’ve ever played. Those had far better simulations of the games themselves. More on that, in a bit. You might think I’m comparing apples to oranges, but sports management video games are fairly similar in the User Interface department at least, if not game mechanics. Speaking of the UI, it’s as dreary as it can ever get. Micromanagement is a necessity even if you delegate an AI coach to deal with the players and their much needed training and tactics during the matches. In the end, it’s gonna come back biting you somewhere once you see just how bad your team fares and you will have to become the coach as well if you wish to stand any chance of finishing the championship in a dignified position. Even if you have so many leagues to choose from North America, Europe and even a few Asian nations, it all plays the same and you don’t even have a randomized minimal visual style to differentiate one team from another (apart from a small logo). As for the hockey players, you don’t see any pictures or portraits with them at all. In FHM 3, only John Does seem to play no matter if you’re in a small town in Canada or in Japan The simulation of the hockey games made me think I’m play testing a game from the early ‘90s. You have the crude drawing of the Ice hockey rink over which a puck moves back and forth with some text below it with the commentator’s insights. It gets old really fast.The title’s spartan approach in regards to its aestethics is sadly worsened by the lack of any sounds. I really wouldn’t have believed it if I didn’t actually try to play and “enjoy” this game. Even shovelware on Steam, costing 10 cents has more sounds than FHM 3. It’s beyond me, the dev team’s decision to esckew even a barebones repetitive tune or a crowd cheering. Anything is better than silence. Did I mention this game loads very slowly? Its sluggishness is inexplicable considering most modern CPUs. You’re telling me I can host lighitning fast 3D battles with thousands of soldiers in a Total War game, but a 2D hockey manager requires 10 minutes just to load all its database if you start a new game? Don’t even get me started on the game’s settings and resolution issues. FHM 3’s idea of fullscreen still implies that I hide the taskbar. Steam Overlay doesn’t even wish to start along with the game, not that I was just dying to showcase any screenshots with it. Pros+ Simulates the stress of being a sports manager/coach, I guess?+ Steam Achievements & Steam Trading Cards.Cons- UI and basic Steam overlay issues- Immensely overpriced- Lacks almost any form of imagery- No soundsResult / Final thoughtsI don’t think I’ll need to play this genre for quite some time from now. I’ve had my fill and no matter how much of a fan I might be of simulations in general terms, sometimes arcades have their merits. Not having even a small measure of visual aid, harms such management games a lot. I knew they are a niche genre and I respect their well-accustomed playerbase, but there are enough alternatives to Franchise Hockey Manager 3. Even it’s predecessor, which is at the time of this writing 17 dollars cheaper, seems like a smarter choice. Asking $36.99 is just outrageous.Rating 40/100 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews, through the generous contribution of RedHill. ",1490,555,56,147,216,17,229

												Got this game as an avid hockey lover and fan of the ootp series. I purchased the game for 29.99.  Disclaimer:This review is based primarily off of one full Path of Glory season.  Note these are not 'Cons' but more observances. - coaching is nearly impossible with the rating system. It does not scale. be prepared to never have advantages of any kind. (There appears to be a fix here and that is huge and a great sign for the future.)- penalties have brought some confusion for me. Several times I thought a PP or SH goal occurred but it did not. Also the majority of my team incurred greater penalty numbers than the years prior. (Again my be my coaching)- scouting is complicated and will take time to understand the nuances. (At least for me)- momentum works well except here and there, in the first 1-3 minutes it can shift to MAX and sometimes lead to a lopsided affair. - UI takes some getting used to. Colors can be tough on the eye for some teams (can be changed). I think Sebastian is right in some form and I am just used to ootp.- Countering roles - I am still figuring out. I think they have proven ineffective so far for me due to the coaching issues mentioned above. There have been times where I go into a game thinking 'I have got these guys pinned'...and don't see an advantage all game- Contracts are a mess of clicks.  - I really want mail updates to be more interesting and more updates relevant to my organization.- I'd love more depth to the depth/farm system. I'd love to have more screens to track development, maybe see the cumulative +/- the players gain throughout the year. TLDR: The game has potential and is far closer to a success than it may appear above. It has its shortcomings but updates will erase a majority of the small ones surely. I can't yet give it a positive review but I hope to change that in the future. EDIT: I reread my review and it comes off unnecessarily harsh and I think ootp bias is creeping in too much. I have edited my comments to reflect my opinions in a more respectable and clear manner.			",12,9,0,15,11,0,15

												Good game for NHL fans who want more depth than what EA's NHL GM mode offers.+ Improved Game Ratings for players+ International Tournaments+ Coach stat tracking+ Lowever average star ratings for players with improved player development curves+ Expansion Draft+ NHL license and Facegen w/ NHL Jerseys+ No Gary BettmanI'm not overly a fan of simming only one day at a time in the new ""Path to Glory"" mode.  Luckily they offer the sandbox mode which lets you play the way you want.   Wonder how hard the new GMs job is going to be in Vegas?  Find out yourself in FHM 3			",5,1,0,1,4,0,2

												I gave this game a try when i saw it on sale (50% off) but ended up asking for a refund.I loved the depth of the leagues, tactics, and mangerial/coaching options.  The salary system also appeared to be very well done.  Overall I can see that the game makes a solid attempt to deliver on its intention to be the most authentic hockey strategy game, however there are major downfalls that prevent it from reaching this goal.Most importanly, the user interface is extremely cumbersome.  Whoever was in charge of it's development should be fired.  clickable shortcuts to view important things like player attributes when setting lines are not present.  Instead you have to navigate to a different menu to view what you are after (player ratings like passing ability, checkign etc.), memorize those and then navigate back again.  This is really difficult to do and very time consuming.A useable interface is lacking in almost every aspect of the game.  Imagine trying to assign scouts to free agent or minor league players without being able to see the individual attributes of your scouts.  Unless you have them memorized, you have to leave the free agent/minor league roster, navigate back to personnel screen of your team, view the scouts attributes, memorize them or write them down, then navigate back to the free agent roster, repeat your search terms (I hope you memorized those too!) and then you can start assigning scouts to roles where they will excel.  Tiring to say the least.Also huge amount of space in the UI are wasted.  The player profile screen has a huge area dedicated to contentment and ability/potential which could easily be repesented by a small table, leaving space for more information on detailed ratings, stats, or anything else.It's frustrating to have such a great concept ruined by a lousy UI.  If this UI is drastically improved I will definitely buy the game again, even at full price .I think the developers could achieve this by adding quick links on lines menus, popups in roster menus, and the ability to click on players to view their attributes when setting lines etc.			",13,4,0,4,1,0,1

												Overall, this is a good game. First off, it is the best hockey sim on the market, even though that market is small. The gameplay is very fun. When it comes to things such as stats and player progression, it is usually very accurate. The NHL License is also a very nice touch and helps make the game feel more complete. The ""main"" Path to Glory mode is a nice addition. While improving the simulation engine from FHM2, they gave a more realistic feeling to the game. Essentially it is like role playing a GM, where you get points to use that will affect how you do things such as train players, or make deals. It is an interesting spin on the normal game, that also shouldn't deter people. If you want more freedom, then sandbox mode is for you. If you want a more realistic feeling, then PTG is the better option. Both game modes are fun. One little thing i did enjoy was the slight upgrade to the UI. Not as nice as OOTP yet, but i do like the upgrade from FHM2There are a few downsides to FHM3 however. One is that there are no online leagues. I personally never played them so idc, but if you are a person who strictly plays them, then sadly this game isn't for you. The developers said that they didnt feel right giving us an incomplete and bad online mode, and would rather work on it until it is up to their standards which i completly agree with and understand. The second thing that this game is missing is the vastness of customization options. I'm use to played OOTP17 which has many, however that series has been around much longer so it makes sense. I still love being able to create my own league, but the little things like fully personalizing league and conference set ups or determining draft order would be nice additions. The only other thing i have noticed is that the game can have slow loading times at points, but nothing game-breaking so far. I already see a good change frmo playing the beta the past few weeks however. This series is only in its third edition, but has made very good improvements each time. The developers have shown this game has promise. The overall game play is good. With these types of games, getting the simulation engine to run smoothly is the most important thing, and FHM3 does a pretty good job at that. Even though it is lacking in customization options for people who enjoy more of a sandbox experience, and online leagues, that game is still enjoyable.8/10			",33,1,0,6,12,1,11

												As a giant hockey fan, as well as an OOTP addict I was very excited to give this game a try. However, I have found there is still a lot of work needed for this game to be considered a realistic sim. Perhaps this game satisifes the average hockey fan, but for me there is a lot to be fixed.First and foremost are player ratings and positions. Too many players have terrible ratings (either rated much too low or much too high) and their positions are all wrong. I put hours into re-rating players and it still is hard to make accurate because of the numerous attribute listings and the uncertainty of their impact on overall rating and potential. Also in terms of positions, many forwards have center listed as their position when they haven't played one game in the NHL at that spot. Also, I'm assuming that LD and RD listed as seperate positions are in someway neccessary for the AI to set line ups because otherwise that totally complicates things and is sort of ridiculous. Off the top of my head, contracts aren't right. We often see a player being paid different amounts in certain years of their contract, but they still have a set AAV which becomes their cap hit. FHM missed the mark on this because then we have certain players (i.e Marian Hossa) already part way through their contract. Therefore, this game has not taken in to account their previous years and the cap hit becomes wrong for said players.Trading needs to be improved as well. Perhaps I would find it more acceptable with accurate player ratings but the AI is way out to lunch a lot of times.Finally, the player roles is a mess. Much too complicated and with too many roles to chose from (specifically you have basically the same role just described in 5 different ways). You also end up struggling to get good chemistry on lines and the only way to find it is by having a skater playing a role that is not realistic to their real life ability and style.In the end, a solid game for a new or average hockey fan. For myself, I want much more of a realistic game that I have become accustomed to by playing OOTP. I have high hopes for FHM4, but cannot reccomend FHM3 at this time.			",0,0,0,0,4,0,0

												I have been playing sports simulations since the late 80s and basically buy all the newest versions of all the top sports sims out there year by year. I was excited when OOTPB announced they would be making FHM innitially, however i quickly dumped the first game. When #2 came out i simply ignored it, but decided to spend my hard earned $ on the 3rd edition. Personally i think this was a huge mistake, i have already deleted the game.For one, this is a poor mans version of OOTPB, which is by far a more furnished and finished product in every single sense of the word. Considering FHM has the backing of OOTPB, i am shocked how the layout is so poorly setup. The colors and layout are painful to look at times. Just looking at this game is irritating, clearly not enough time was spent on the design.The thing i hate most about this game in comparisson to OOTPB is their lack of editing and modding. If in that game you can basically edit everything, here you are very limited. In fact, you cannot even start a game without being forced to pick the NHL (i know that would be most peoples first option, but still). You cannot fiddle around with the teams and for some weird reason the game admin has decided to focus on a mode called Path To Glory which is basically even more limited to what you can edit and is slower paced, you cannot sim into the future like most sims allow you to do, which means a season takes a lot longer.On top of all that, the game has crashed on me 3-4 times and i barely have played the game. Possibly i am a little spoilt after playing OOTPB and Football Manager every year, but i am dissapointed that this game has not progressed a lot more since it's first induction. The only thing going for this game at the moment is that it's only real competitor is a hockey game which is basically running on an engine which is over 10 years old and even then, it is a pretty even competitor. Unless you are crazy about Hockey and love sports sims, i would refrain to buying this and buy a proper sports sim such as the 2 i mentioned above.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you were into Ea Sports GM mode but it just wasnt enough involvement, this is your game, total control over your team and rosters, 2 options for jobs if you dont want any involvement in the coaching aspect you can choose too just GM and build a dream team, NO overall system, everyone has Potential rating out of 5 stars, an ability rating out of 5 stars, they do get a numerical grade based on how they are in their current role, EX. if you got a 4th liner playing top line minutes his GR might be 45-55. as too an actual 2nd liner bumping between 1st and 2nd line would have 60-75 rating. TONS of leagues and one of the most interesting things i like is that they actually sim your prospects stats, EX. you are GM of a WHL team, your farm is basically a Junior B team if you a BC team, and you will be able too see their stats for that league. Same with 14/15 years old still in Midget or bantamn. You are able too go thru all Junior A leagues throuout canada as well as NCAA,USHL,NAHL and much more.Scouting reports mailed quite often in game give you an opportunity too see lots of stats from different leagues. One of 2 things i find difficult too play around is the player roles, they dont really follow the player, but they follow the postion, so setting 2 phyical style player roles too 2nd lw, changin the player wont change that role. But having access too quite a few options for strategies ive been able too find a combination that i like and seems too work for my team.  Negotiating contracts is also a great part of the game that was never really in Ea games, i mean if you call giving them 300k under what they asked and waiting 2 in-game days for a reply negotiating. FH3 ai will actively counter offer you  on the spot so it seems more interactive.   Worth the 40$, waiting for a sale is never a bad idea tho. MUCH better than paying 80 for that♥♥♥♥♥♥Ea puts out every year.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Pre-Release, Public Beta ReviewFranchise Hockey Manager 3 is quite an improvement from the previous installment, where glitches and a poor interface ruined gameplay. FHM2 felt uncompleted, and just far too difficult to get into. The best point to be made about FHM3 for myself is the new tactical system. Just the sheer amount of roles and worldwide strategies puts the game above last year's edition. Looking at the other new features - NHL License, Path to Glory, Sandbox, International, Rebuilt Injury System, Updated Development Process, Updated Interface, Steamworks Support, and Steam Achievements - while all are nice additions, the one that stands out is Path to Glory. While the gamemode actually runs extremely slow in simulation, the concept and basics are there. Obviously needs a lot of tweaking, for example, the in-game sim at times freezes, and the boxscore doesn't always show the second goaltender if you take out your starter mid-game. But of course, it hasn't been publicly released yet, so I'll let it slide. The international aspects, while interesting, also has many issues, such as two-goal overtimes. Overall, the AI has gotten better, but still could use improvement, and there are definitely too many injuries. Apart from that, the game seems solid, although I do wish the simulation would be as quick OOTP, and if not, at least that we could see stats durinng the loading times.			",58,24,0,6,29,2,8

												Weaker in some aspects compared to Eastside Hockey Manager, stronger in others.Pros:- League expansion- Fairly easy to mod and make custom teams/leagues- Officially licensed by the NHL- Dev team is active on the OOTP forums and updates the game regularly- Contract negotiations are much more realistic than EHMCons:- Generally much more ""simple""- UI can be difficult to navigate- Player parity takes huge hits with little steps in attributes, ex. knocking 5 stat points off total from a 4 star player (like taking off 1 speed, 1 shot range, 1 aggression) will make them a 3 star player in some cases. Way too many 2.5 star players in the league but that can be solved with roster updates- Slow simulation- Still has bugs, on OSX I have occasional crashes out of nowhere and a lot of text glitches in emails- Difficult to manage minor league teamsOverall, it's definitely worth a shot if you want some hockey management sim action. It's not quite at the level of EHM, but it will probably overtake it soon with the amount of work going into it. If you're on PC and you prefer the ability to customize your leagues and teams or want to take over an expansion team, this is your game. If you're on OSX, this is your only option, but it's still a pretty solid option. 6.5/10.			",13,6,0,3,7,1,5

												Putting up an early review but this is a far from complete review.  I am giving it a thumbs up presently but only because I need to give it something and don't want to hurt the rating while I try to size it up.Early observations:Pros- Plenty of options and love having historical seasons available  (presently trying the 1987 season)Cons- Crash during the first game simmed- UI taking a little getting used to and some things aren't readily obvious (tried to advance to the season and kept getting maximum contract exceeded message; no salary cap so it wasn't that; had cut down to the correct number of roster players (23) so it wasn't that; eventually stumbled upon another screen that displayed the number of players under contract and saw I was 51/50 so I bought out a contract and was able to continue.  A better message may be that maximum number of players under contract has been exceeded; it looks more like a salary cap type of issue with the present message.			",180,56,8,41,87,17,58

												Since this is a manager-game it's all about UI and presentation. Sadly the UI is really terrible.The UI is unintuitive. It's hard to find things and even harder to understand how to do some things at all. And  there are a lot of unnecessary screen-transitions. During game simulation the recap are hard to follow due to no actual log present. ",337,82,3,49,17,1,59

												For me, the game is still not in a climate-finance manager. The CPU can not use salary cap system, after a few seasons all clubs are playing without having to go to the limit of salary cap. Structure of contracts is bad, no improvement on the version of FHM 2. Too bad, because the rest of the stuff is pretty ok. Maybe you can fix it by updating game, but the previous version had the same problem and has never been ""cured""			",0,0,0,0,2,0,0

												I'd love to love this game but I can't. I certainly like the game but there are some problems with sim freezing, game crashing in middle of month so you have to go back in time and do it again. Trade offers are pretty ridiculous from other teams. Players talent drop off way too fast - everyone retires at 32-36 yrs old. Wish there was more to do with personalized development of draft picks/farm system.Overall - satisfied. Into my 5th years as GM of Kings - Chicago still a pain in my♥♥♥♥♥			",28,9,0,11,4,0,8

												Got my hands into FHM3 for a few hours finally.  Big improvement on last year's game.  The main point of interest is the NHL license.  It adds a whole other dimension to the game, and allows you to immerse yourself into the role more.  Another big point for me, which actually caused me to stop playing FHM2, are the changes to the interface.  In FHM2, the interface was so bland and boring, text was so small, it was so difficult to focus on what you were doing and where you were supposed to look.  Though improvements could still be made in my opinion(certain font sizes, bolding, etc), the GUI is now wonderfully shaded with your team's colours - this has had a huge impact on my interest to learn the game more.This iteration of FHM features more in-depth ratings and player stats, more logically and cleanly placed information and controls that are relative to what your task is and a great tactics system, which I'm learning to love.  I may be wrong about this, but it seems the game/match engine is improved quite a bit as well.Having been disgusted in recent years with EA's NHL game(which I did not buy after trying, and will not play), this is about as good of a replacement as there is.  Obviously, you don't play the games, but there is a plethora of depth in this title that EA's title came nowhere close to, so anyone who enjoys the managerial side of hockey can appreciate this game.I'm still hoping for a visual match engine; something like what Football Manager has, but better of course.  I know it's probably a long way off, but I think this game is headed there.The inclusion of the workshop is huge plus!  Whether you want to create the Charlestown Chiefs, or replicate your beer league hockey team, you can do it.There is always room for improvement, but I feel that FHM has transformed from a game I have hope for, to a game I actually want to play.  It needs to be noted that I have not experienced any of the crashes that some of the other reviewers have, not yet any way.			",223,29,4,15,21,1,41

												No matter what you do the results are the same. I restarted 4 seasons with the Toronto maple leafs and each year was the same, no matter what I did. The goaly is injured and we all know he was back for the start of the season but in this game I don't get him back tell Dec. I went to the free agents list at the start of the year and got myself 2 star defencmen and still the same results. Mathews my rookie, the reports at the end of the month, one of the stats that are given to him is Fighting+1 Has Mathews ever fought once? Is he at the rink everday practicing fighting? The coach plays the top players in preseason from day one so if they get injured to bad they wont be ready for the start of the season. Not enough information where there should be information. No pictures of any players, fake digital jerseys not even the real ones.Runs slow, takes forever to load, don't bother trying to do something else while running this game cause it will crash. Their,  that should be helpful for you guys, if not, to ♥♥♥♥ing bad.One thing this game is missing like all of them is Heart, stats are one thing to go by but sometimes it takes more then just stats and thats heart. I would add this stat to all players and some how work it in. For me I have players being sent down because their stats suck but I know they have heart and much more to give...Injuries in this game is a joke, this is how the injury thing works, take your 23 players and put them all in a hat and than pick, injuries don't go by players it's just random.

												  If you like playing GM Mode in the EA Sports NHL series, then this is the game for you. Now it has some small negatives, but if you do not mind a few hiccups then keep on reading.     What makes me happy about this game is the depth in the expansive hockey world this game features. There are many features i wish NHL games had in their GM Mode, and this game delivers in that area of depth. Simple things like renegotiating contracts mid season, and no trade/no move clauses are a very nice thing to have. I love the scouting in this game, and you are able to see what a player has for season stats to give you a general idea of what they may be capable of, which of course the NHL series does not have. Being able to command a national team for me puts the cherry on top. Back to negotiating contracts, it is nice to not only be able to select the length of contract, but fluctuate how much money the player will make each year, so front loaded contracts are a thing! If you are really into statistics, this game has got your back. The game has many advanced stats such as Corsi. As well they are active on the forums and are constantly working on updating the game. There are so many more things, but it would take too long to write it all out.      Now, for the negatives. The games can have a tendency to crash, but if you have the game on auto save weekly, you won't lose too much work. People have complained about the UI, but I disagree and I believe its one of the better ones out there, easy to navigate. Now, I had a game breaking crash in year 4, and no matter what, I could not sim passed a certain day, buuuuuut, the developers are very helpful on the forum and I wrote a post, uploaded my save on there File Server, and in 3 days they had diagnosed the problem, and saved my save file and it was playable again. So HUGE shout-out  to the developer for being very supportive.To conclude:PROS:- Depth of game world- Scouting- Contracts- International Jobs- In depth statistics- Very helpful and responsive developersCONS:- Crashes (Although playable)TL:DR - Great game for anyone who loves sports sim games despite it's small flaws.10/10: Would buy again and support small developer.

												I never really played any hockey manager games before, the closest thing being the Be a GM Mode in the EA Sports NHL series, so i was really surprised with the depth and customization the game had to offer. Being able to play in the CHL, europe and even in the asian leagues was so new and amazing to me, and its awesome to see your prospects develop into Elite players or to just sign some really great veterans (KOVALCHUK IS  A GOD IN THIS GAME).BUT, after the first hours of learning and progressing through  my first years as a GM, the whole amazement was gone and it was clear that yes,  there are some real issues with saves crashing, ridiculous trade offers by AI GMs and Owners with no patience, that so many GMs and coaches are fired right in the first months of the season.  So yeah, it maybe a little too much to ask for full price for a game that feels half-finished, but it is really fun nonetheless.Btw, the UI is REALLY terrible, the devs should look into that asap.

												The game crashed when trying to load up a save when my season hasn't even gone through 3 months....can't recommend a 40$ game that has too many technical issues and save files can get unplayable that easy especially when you are hoping to play on one for a long time. I was hoping that the issues I was seeing from the other reviews weren't true but as of right now the game is simply too much for its price. It is too frustrating to attempt to play a game like this if you keep losing progress and you want to have fun not be irritated. Games simply shouldn't be released when they can crash so easily for non hardware related issues.			",16,3,0,4,9,1,15

												It looks a little bit more polished than FHM 2, but FHM 2, to me, has this game beat hands down in terms of creativity and enjoyment.  The UI isn't very good, and the computer makes some really, really bad trades.  FHM 2 had it's flaws, but I found it a better game.  Also, the injury bug knocked FIVE of my players out for 4 months or more.  I wasn't the only team with that problem.  I also miss having the ability of multiple human GMs, something not in FHM 3.All in all, I would suggest waiting until the price comes down significantly on this before buying.  I don't want to sound too harsh on them, as this game has potential, but it's not quite there yet.			",1,0,0,4,5,0,2

												I have enjoyed playing the game, however I am tired of having to re-play the same days over and over again/lose any progress due to it crashing repeatedly. Very frustrating.Nov. 12 Update: Since the latest patch I have found the game to run much smoother and with way less crashing (I believe it's crashed once in approx 6 hours of game play). After reading some other suggestions I switched the auto-save feature to weekly in order to minimize any potential lost time. Thanks to the developers for updating and addressing the concerns. It's much more enjoyable experience now and I would recommend the game to others.			",1,9,0,0,3,1,2

												As expected the game improved vastly from his predecessor by offering a new, very deep, sophisticated tactics engine (offering historical tactics as well), a new impossible-to-cheat-mode (Path to Glory). There are still enough improveable aspects (AI selection, AI trade behaviour) but it´s definetly worth the money if you´re into hockey managment or a historical hockey buff (historical mode from 1931 on).

												Franchise Hockey Manager 3 is a brilliant simulation of being a GM/Coach in the World of Ice Hockey. The improvement over the previous version is impressive with improved tactics,  international play, improved player development, much improved game ratings for players and also an improved UI that is easier to navigate. The choices of game modes have been expanded to suit the needs of how users want to play i.e modern day, historical or custom and the path to glory option. The game engine produces an impressive amount of stats not found in other hockey GM games and has also been improved in this latest version. Also injuries to players are less random. Players will be injured in situations that occur during games such as sustaining a broken nose or injured eye during a fight. All this plus other new features means that this game is much more than just an update to FHM2.The game isn't perfect and there are still improvements that can be made but OOTP are committed to their products. Their baseball game OOTP Baseball is second to none but that took years to get to the point it is at now. FHM is a new series with a huge amount of potential.The game is well worth buying and having secured an NHL license there is an added sense of realism to what is already a very impressive and immersive hockey simulation.

												Pre-ordered the eSellerate version and played the beta and the fullversion. It feels like FHM 3 should had remained in the beta phase a few months longer. I come from playing EHM in 138 hours and FHM 3 feels unfortunately not quite finished. I play mainly with teams from SHL and it feels like the league is not a priority in terms of the first updates that have come.+ Has a greater potential than EHM. + Wide choice of tactics. Nice to see DIF Hockey's old Torpedo hockey tactic. - Much in the game feels unfinished at the launch of the game.- The UI feels complicated but you can get used to it.I have no doubt that FHM 4 will be what I'm looking for, but I dont feel that I can recommend this game right now if you are looking for a hockey manager game in style with other well-functioning manager games such as the FM series. Wait for the devs to release a couple of updates that fix a few messes. After that FHM 3 has gone past EHM with horse lengths.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played well over 100 hours of FHM2 and thought that game was a solid installment in a new series. I love hockey and have always been saddened by the lack of true hockey simulators on the market. I played a good dozen hours in the beta and then a chunk of the final release and I can say that this is another big step for the FHM franchise. PROS:* decent interface (especially when compared to EHM)* Useful information at the click of a button* More in depth ratings, stats and player info* Better match engine*Multiple leagues*Good farm system mechanics* New tactics system and player roles helps coaching/managementCONS* some stability issues* occasional strange game results* UI could use a little bit of work to reduce clickingOverall, if you enjoy hockey or sports management games or enjoyed FHM2 this game will surely give you a positive experience. While its not OOTP or FM its well on its way to joining those franchises at the pinnacle. Also, its easy to forget that those franchises literally started 15+ years ago... this one started 4 years ago. Just saying.9/10 would lose the Stanely Cup again...and again and again...
