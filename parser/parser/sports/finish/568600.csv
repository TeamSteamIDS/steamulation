												I agree with everyone else posted. It looks pretty real physics and design.			",9,10,0,1,14,3,3

												Pretty neat really, the environment looks great with authentic reflections and shadows. The basket ball has a characteristic weight to it, but it's a little off from real to me, the bounce and ball physics come accross a little too heavy and the bounce slightly under inflated.This demonstration would be an amazing starter to be into made into a complete multiplayer basketall game.

												I have to say this game is very realistic. You can tell it's not your typical pixelated VR game.It's very hard to even score in this game and the bouncing could be a lot better.That having said I spent a good few minutes playing this game! Sadly it's not something you could play for hours. However if it would be possible to make this game multiplayer? In the sense that friends of yours can join in and have fun. I wasn't exactly talking about random online people. Overall I really enjoyed this game. Definitely worth a try!8/10 + 0.1 for being a free game.			",131,53,6,21,17,4,13
