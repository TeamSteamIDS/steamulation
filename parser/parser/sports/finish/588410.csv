												The tennis is a genuine blast. They solved the movement problem very well. I have played so much the last two days my shoulder is sore!			",44,0,1,5,21,3,23

												+: Tennis - Wow! Amazing! \O/-: Ping Pong - 	This ping pong needs option that allow to turn racket  90 degree relative to controller by its axis.  (like racket position in ""Eleven"").	  If you want play most realistic ping pong  - ""Eleven"" is better.			",106,45,6,3,39,7,5

												I bought this game mainly because of the tennis part and it feels really good. I'm neither a real tennis nor ping pong player, but both disciplines are great fun and you can choose between ""Fun"" mode (simplified physics) and ""Real"" mode ('real' physics).There are different options for audio, playarea, paddle position and so on and the UI is intuitive and easy to use.The ping pong part is nice, whereas Eleven: Table Tennis VR still feels like the best ping pong simulator to me in terms of physics. However there is a career mode, beside partice and online mode, in Virtual Sports, for both tennis and ping pong, which is demanding, AI gets stronger and plays different, and rewarding because you also unlock additional opponents and environments.Tennis works flawless, you will be teleported to a sport where you can reach the ball after your opponent returned it. It only needs ~two matches to get used to. You can also teleport yourself to play close to the net, which is very difficult imho.Graphics are fine, some levels could be a little bit more detailed, antialiasing especially on the ping pong table and both rackets are great though, performance is top. Sound design is appropriate, haptic feedback is good.More content and improvments here and there would be nice, a two vs two mode would be awesome, but overall I can recommend this game in its current state!

												Ping Pong - If you think this is fun, go buy Eleven immediately. Eleven is like this game...but cranked to 11Tennis - I like tennis...real life tennis. This is like that, but dialed down to like a 2The locamotion is tough because it doesn't move you until the ball is already on it's way back over the net, so when it does teleport you, it's right before the ball needs to be hitThree suggestions- Listed in order of ease to incorporate...by someone who has no idea how games are made1 - Add an option on tennis for a ball machine practice. Lots of room for variation of shot patterns to mix things up and the person can sit in the same place for a few shots and have time after teleporting to re-adjust when moved2 - Option to make the ball bigger11 - Crank tennis up to 113 - Make a racquetball mode. Doesn't cover as big of a distance. Might even be able to squeeze it into roomscale with no need for teleportation. I'd buy that in a heartbeat. Think it eliminates a lot of the obstacles that tennis has in making it more like really real tennis			",34,11,3,2,13,4,0

												The Good:Fantastic experience - The best table tennis yetFeel is spot onSpin and in air bending is just rightLove all of the different opponentsThe Not as Good:I think that when you swing and your paddle crosses the paddle icon on the table...it might make the ball go through the paddle instead of hit it.When suffient spin is placed on the ball and the opponent does not hit the ball at the correct angle it should spin off in a different direction.  I don't think that the spin is applied when calculating the direction the ball should leave the paddle.  Either that or we are using some seriously slick paddles. ",20,6,4,0,8,1,0

												Virtual Sports is a worthy videogame and an excellent workout. It's balanced and extremely user friendly, everyone could start to play in seconds in the ""Fun"" setting (the default one) saving at the same time some consistency and realism in physics, and some depth as well. You can turn that setting for more realism and here the game is way less forgiving, for those who wants more. In any case, it's solid.Table tennis and full tennis share the same kind of progression, some opponents with very different style of playing, three difficulty levels with different locations and a career where you should beat any player in any level. This grant some goals and a gently progression, something than is lacking in almost all similiar games.Tennis is the real star, there are some titles for VR but all of them are or very weak or scifi oriented. If feels very good, you can understand easily when and how to hit the ball, the self teleport mechanics work flawlessy. It's realtively safe as well because it force the player to stay into his small square, but could be easily dangerous for low ceilings as here you can smash at full force and lobs happens.On the other hand, Table Tennis is very good as well. It's natural to compare this one to Eleven or Paddle Up (we shouldn't forget how weak it was Pong Waves when out, the today's game is the end of a very long path mixing two different projects). I'm not a pro so I can't give a final opinion on realism, but it's good enough and support spins and smashes in the proper way. What surely offer as plus is the career, who is missing in almost all other games (we shouldn't forget Ping Pong VR with his arcade mode, fun but with a bad physics). Any opponent at any level play very differently.I would underline something than Virtual Sports could do better as well, even if it's a suggested buy in my opinion. First thing, the overall style is... weird, it's a sort of Wii Sports on acid: it's like is trying to be funny failing the target, too many colours, too many strange items around you, that weird dog. Details are remarkable but style is not. It's noticeable also some lacking in the music, at least some jingles should be added in my opinion. From the gameplay side, devs should add more options like a real torunament (and especially full a tennis match with more sets, longer avaliable now is 1 full set). I would love also for more contents even if it's yet pretty decent.At the end, being ""Virtual Sports"" and not ""Virtual Tennis"", I hope (even with DLCs) in more sports of this quality as addictional contents for the future.

												A nice surprise -- very polished and fun.  I've played a lot of Eleven ping pong but I enjoy the single player ping pong in Virtual sports  more.  I actually feel like I'm playing against different opponents in Virtual Sports where in Eleven I feel like I'm playing against invincible robots that sometimes let me win a point here or there.  I'll leave it to others to discuss how realistic the physics are, but for me the physics are close enough to feel like I'm playing ping pong (don't play a lot in real life). Tennis is fun as well -- obviously teleporting tennis is never going to be perfect, but I've played a couple of hours of it already which is more time than I spend in most vive games I purchase.  I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys racket sports.			",99,18,1,7,15,2,4

												very good game. physics are almost spot on (especially the table tennis) BUT, can you guys please add an option to disable the automatic movement in the tennis section? i'm planning on getting a 10m x 10m room, so i want to move myself (physically in real life, as i will have the space to do so)so PLEASE add an option to manually move ourselves (without teleportation assistance)			",66,22,4,1,18,3,1

												Excellent!  I bought it for Tennis since I already have all the Pingpong games.   For less than $20.00, you get your own tennis court!  The career mode make me coming back for more.   I am stuck playing the champions because I am not a regular tennis player and it is not easy to play the champions (which is a good thing)I wish I can play  with someone.  But there has not been anyone on line. ",133,43,5,4,29,9,5
