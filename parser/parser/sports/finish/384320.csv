												After 30 minutes, winning one match, getting some cool shots and goals I really cant recommend this game to beginners or gamers who are not 100% familiar with handball.Not gonna do full review, basic things which I found really unfriendly. No tutorials/guides or practice sessions, you do get button guide through game but nothing explained further. Gameplay seems to fast and unrealistic so outside of tactical perspective you dont really get ""immersion"" which you get in other sport games.Physics are completely out of question, kinda static players and standing above ball waiting for 1sec to collect it from ground looks kinda funny although really outdated in terms of mechanic along with couple more things.No cool slowmotion goals mostly due to lack of physics and pretty much monotonous gameplay. Main menu including career/season statistic and overall gui is very simple without any a bit more involved features and options.Overall if you are huge fan of Handball sport, go get it but definitely even then not worth 40$ or even 30$ (currently on sale). Perhaps for 15$ it would be suitable game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game comes without a training mode -> this is a bad idea (Training camp was very cool). For a new player, who had seen only on TV handball is really hard to try out the movements, shots during a match. And only one difficulty level (with Kiel is hard to be beat a one-star team for a newby). After many local and career mode play the game is really hard, and the rules ... sometimes funny (from one fault x2 2min; frequent offensive fouls); ball steals after rebound are comic. During the career mode you can control the whole team -> whose career? Even the results are hidden, and the table is buggy (w4/d6/l4 against w6/d7/l0 is equal).I played with the Training Camp earlier, and waited for the evolution of the game, but I think this is a wrong way...
