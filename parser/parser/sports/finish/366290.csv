Early Access Review
								This dev is extremely sketchy and already seems to be running into money issues.  He launched his game with the asking price of 20$ in early May.  I purchased it for this price on May 7 2015.  Within a week he dropped the price by 33% permanently to 13$.  I made a post asking him about it and not liking the fact something I purchased in early access was already seemingly running into money problems and having to drop the cost so much.  Now I see less than a month after that he is already offering a 75% off sale on steam, so early after release and in early access.  I have never seen such price drops.  Be very wary of this dev and his apparent ability to manage finances with all these price drops so early into release.  I commented on my original post regarding this and showing another price drop to potential new buyers of the game and the dev banned me and deleted my post his ban message did not contain a reason.As for the game itself, it currently feels very clunky, there is no reeling animations or things of that nature.  There is no mouse or controller support. I would stay far away from this until the dev proves he can support the game and provide regular updates.  Censoring supporters of the game on the steam forums to try to block others from seeing what he has already done with the price by banning them from the forums is definitely a red flag and I would advise my friends and everyone else to stay far away from the game.

								Carp Fishing Simulator mentions it's the most advanced authentic fishing sim on the market. They were not wrong. After playing recent games like Dovetail Fishing which seemed very arcade focused, I was pleasantly surprised at just how much of a simulation this game is. Time of day, weather and peg selection all play a huge role. Don't expect to catch a fish every time you cast, patience is required and if you want to hook the big ones some knowledge of bait, line and rig setups is huge plus.

With that said you don't need to be a professional either. Amateurs can  randomly select bait, have a little patience and enjoy a relaxing day catching fish. I'm the first to admit many of the options went well over my own head as we catch mostly bream, barra and coastal fish in australia. Was still able to land a few 25 odd kilo carp, sizable catfish and plenty of smaller stuff which brought a smile to the dial. Far more then just carp fishing as well. At the moment the game contains several species of carp, catfish, bream, perch and tench with plans to add more species in future. Fish AI was a real highlight, all placed into the lake with no pre-scripted movements or behaviors. Releasing fish could use some tweaking but the catching part itself feels quite good.Graphically speaking it's reasonable for a sim. Setting up your tent and lines around the nearest snag point on the lake while watching the sun slowly drop behind the hills can really help on those stressful days. Would like to see more detail added to the surrounds but it's passable. Fish all seem to be the one size, reeling animations and a few other things need work but nothing missing that's gamebreaking. One nice feature is the leaderboard which shows all the catches around the world and how you match up, in recent patches it now stores all these for future bragging rights to friends.Other plans that I'm aware of is adding online multiplayer, different ways of fishing, new locations and character creation, along with tweaking and refining the whole experience of course. Carp Fishing Simulator can only get better from here and it's a game I can highly recommend keeping your eye on to any fishing or simulator enthusiast. Cheers folks and happy gaming/fishing. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
