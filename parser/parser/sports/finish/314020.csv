												The gameplay isn't terribly memorable. It's basically a hidden object game with some light puzzle solving elements. Ah, but the art and the atmosphere! The vibrant, lush artwork is worth the price of admission on its own. This must be what the jungle looks like after a cup of Ayahuasca.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played through the whole game, but I can't really recommend it. It was maybe 2 hours or so long, but I spent most of that time feeling frustrated and unrewarded. It is a very simple point-and-click game, only they somehow made the controls of a point-and-click game frustrating - you have to hold down your click to move, and the bug would frequently start spinning around when they'd reach a certain point along the path, and you have to figure out where you can click to get him moving again.The hidden object part of the game is incredibly simple, and also somewhat frustrating - I know you're going to make me collect the floating orange balls, but I can't do so until I slowly move across several screens to find the thing that is going to need them. Lots of backtracking for no reason. No real rhyme or reason as to why doing a given gathering task ended with the results it did. I also wasn't really sure the game ended, until I saw that I had all of the achievements. The music is excellent, the art is nice, but in the end - I got the game on a huge sale, and only spent 2 hours playing it, and I wish I hadn't done so. Credit to the creators for trying something different, but it didn't work for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Morphopolis is a game about bugs, some of the smallest creatures in the world and they are rather fascinating and very important to our environment aswell. This game is a point and click game with puzzles to solve and hidden objects to discover and find, this will help the small bug on its journey of life. This is a very pretty and colourful game, and not very difficult to play.Also you must complete each chapter, if you decide to stop halfway through you will have to start from the beginning of that chapter, as there is no exit feature while in a level so I just completed them and exited the game afterwards.Morphopolis is a very short game and the achievements are easy to earn. I found the last puzzle rather challenging, but I managed to solve it and get 100% achievements :)I have enjoyed my time playing with the bugs and admiring the lovely art and colours, thankyou for this lovely gift. ;D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												MORPHOPOLIS is a gorgeous-looking, casual slow-burn puzzler fueled by hidden object elements; one that I recommend with the caveat that it will certainly not be for everyone.  While not brutally difficult, it is a sometimes frustrating experience that it is well-suited for the casual puzzle and artistic game fan.   There is little direction; and the lack of the ability to save while in the middle of one of MORPHOPOLIS' five beautiful segments is rough, as the inherent beauty of this game is it's calm, wickedly slow movement and it's mesmerizing artwork.  So failing to finish a segment during a sitting results in the dreaded do-over, with your ever-morphing insect ponderously revisiting the beautiful yet limited screens.  That said, the episodes are fairly short, and the game can be finished in a short span (as short as 90 minutes), with all achievements.  But there is the rub; this is not a game you speed through; it is one you savor.  And for someone like myself who's immersion is often limited to nights and weekends by work exhaustion or time constraints, I thoroughly enjoyed playing through the various trials of our weary bug, as a calming cool down for the brain if you will... Though the puzzles vary from fairly difficult to rather simple, puzzle veterans may have a leg up on recognizing what it is you are supposed to actually do.  There is zero direction... but hit the discussion board for the concept, and off you go.  Only other minor fret was that in some cases, the hidden object items you are required to collect are quite difficult to discern and at times don't really resemble what you need to find; and I am not hot on clicking randomly as a strategy.  Still, for what it is, MORPHOPOLIS succeeds in being an engrossing, beautiful, casual, albeit short experience that is worth a go if you want to step away from the bullet hell for a moment.  If you enjoy it for what it is, you are bound to be rewarded with a fun little puzzler that is certainly like no other... ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game because it was on sale (95% off) and has cards and achievements.  Never really expecting anything else from it.  But when I played the game, I knew I found a hidden gem.Morphopolis is a point & click, hidden object, and puzzle game set in a colorful insect world.   I love the atmosphere!  The art is gorgeous and the music helps to bring out more of the supposedly ""nature"" setting.   The game is divided into five short segments.  You can finish the whole game in 2 to 4 hours.  Basically, you need to guide the insect to find the objects and solve the puzzles needed to get through to the next metamorphic phase.  The hidden objects are fairly easy to find.  There are some that blend well with the background (but there'a a hint button anyway if you're feeling lazy to really search for them).  The puzzles are moderately challenging  (I find the last puzzle a bit more challenging than the rest.).  In some puzzles (like the glow worm, perhaps), I think you'll spend more time figuring out what to do than solving them. :DIf you are a card collector and an achievement hunter, this one's for you.  Only five cards to collect and you can unlock every achievement as you finish the game.The only cons I found are:(1) the lack of direction / instruction.  When I began the game, I only saw a ""hand"" symbol that tells me to move my insect to that direction.  And that's it.  But you can easily figure out the game mechanics as you progress.(2) you cannot save / quit in the middle of the segments.You can force quit the game but your progress won't be saved.  You have to redo everything in that particular level.Do I recommend this game? YES!  For me, I find the good points of this game outweigh these cons.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nice as an art gallery, but awful as a game.The bugs move reeeeaally slowly. I know how fast bugs move in real life. I have seen them. Why do they move so slowly here? There's no reason other than to draw out the gameplay way longer than it needs to be.The game isn't very good at letting you know what you can and can't do. The only way to move is to hold your mouse down in the direction you want to go, but you can only go along preset paths, and some of the screens are in places that don't even look like paths and feel like you'd only ever find them on accident.It's basically a glorified hidden object game, except everything is so vibrant that the stuff you have to pick out doesn't tend to stand out enough. There were a few instances where I wasn't even sure what exactly I was looking for. The minigames are generally alright, though there's two that are abnormally challenging compared to the rest of the game. The flower bud puzzle especially, which is painful both because of the puzzle itself and the fiddly controls.It's very short. 5 small ""levels"". No real connecting story except that you play as the creature you helped in the previous level, and at the end you open a door and then the screen just fades out. Abrupt.The game looks very pretty and sounds pretty nice too, I'll give it that, but it's slow and frustrating for what should be a relaxing experience, and not worth the money for what little gameplay is given to the player.

												Verdict: Take a peek at the posted screenshots to enjoy the hand drawn art if that is what drew you to this, no need to buy and play the game for that. The 'game', as implemented, is an exercise in frustration.Positive:- Cute hand drawn graphics.- It's different, stands out in used art and 'delivery' of the puzzles.- At 95% off, really cheap.Negative:- Total lack of graphics/sound/control settings (why do people keep doing this for PC games?)- Zero instructions, tutorial or guidance, so just click around and watch what happens and see if you can figure out what the devs were thinking at the time.- 5 levels total, with 1-4 hidden object puzzles each, some of which have additional puzzles after. Again, zero instructions so just click stuff and maybe you'll see something happen that will give you a clue about what's expected of you.- Level puzzles are spread out over several screens, so you have to make your bug crawl around, with regular backtracking required. Excruciatingly slow method of scrolling between level screens, and no way to speed it up.- There is not even a hint at what paths your bug can even take. No arrows, no clearly different coloured or constructed pathways, nothing. Just click the screen edges at different spots and wait to see how far the bug will crawl and maybe by the time it gets there it'll scroll the screen and hey, now you know. Or click a different spot and wait some more.- No save/load options. It will remember a level as fully finished, but leaving a level unfinished forces you to restart all the puzzles you already solved on that level.- Even with all that, it's an extremely short game. I fully finished it in under 3 hours, of which almost half was spent just clicking randomly and most of the other half waiting for the bugs to crawl to scroll the screen, and only a fraction actually doing any puzzle solving.I can understand trying to do things different from all the others. I can understand trying to be artsy. I can understand trying to minimize user interface and controls.But for the love of all that is good and right in PC gaming, please never let any of that prevent you from implementing the required basics:- PC's are not a standard environment, and PC users are used to having pretty detailed control. A settings dialog allowing to change graphics/sound/controls is a must on the PC platform.- Some basic instructions about controls, method and goal of the game. Random clicking to see what happens is not 'learning to play', it's just plain annoying.- Save/load/checkpoint mechanics, especially in a game that makes one waste a lot of time just getting around on a level.Sorry, but even at pennies, I can't recommend this as a game. Cute art style though, so check out the screenshots.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Morphopolis may be one of the most beautiful games I've played this year, but its remarkable looks aren’t always backed up by strong puzzle design. Taking on the role of a caterpillar as it undergoes five metamorphoses into ever larger insects, you’ll find hidden objects and solve puzzling minigames across more than a dozen scenes — each as lusciously detailed as the last — all backed by a stellar soundtrack amidst a bare-bones interface.Feeling somewhat like Machinarium meets The Tiny Bang Story, Morphopolis has you walking your insect between scenes. Each location holds one or more obstacles that can only be overcome after you collect all the objects it’s missing. Sometimes that leads to the obstacle simply moving out of the way; other times, you must complete a minigame or puzzle. Most of these are fairly straightforward, though trial and error is necessary as there’s no guidance, and a few prove confounding, especially given the limited feedback on offer. Astounding presentation and imaginative world designs are what set Morphopolis apart. Each scene is akin to a painting come to life, hand-illustrated in gorgeous watercolor hues and pencil-sketch precision, and the world seems to grow and alter in perspective as your parasitic critter inhabits larger hosts. All the while, multi-layered and earthy ambient music sets a laid-back tone that perfectly suits the dawdling pace and relaxing mechanics of the adventure.The problem is that it’s set back by puzzles that alternate between overly simplistic and too opaque, encouraging experimentation without providing enough feedback with which to gauge how your interactions affect the system. Morphopolis ultimately relies too strongly on its looks to get by with a relatively weak design.The astonishing illustrations, excellent soundtrack, and delightful world of Morphopolis may be worth the price of admission alone in what is an otherwise middling hidden-object game.

Basic InformationTitle:  MorphopolisDeveloper:  Dan Walters and Ceri WilliamsPublisher:  Dan WaltersGenre:  Puzzle point ‘n clickGeneral ImpressionMorphopolis surprised me with its elegant simplicity. It’s obviously, an indie game but one which really stands out with its almost psychedelic visual style and color palette. The game feels different with, metamorphosis being the focal point of a storyline filled with puzzles and hidden objects that await discovery. It is sadly far too short and relatively easy to complete. The lack of any replay value is offset however, by the more than decent price tag and the inclusion of both Achivements and Trading Cards.Strong Points+ Superb hand-drawn artworks.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- Short and too easy.Rating 8/10 This review was submitted for SUPER Giveaways.

												Morphopolis is a gorgeous P&C game bringing you through the life of a bug that morphs into other forms as it completes its journey. Where that journey goes exactly, is not really known, but you will point and click your way through several beautifully designed levels, finding hidden objects to unlock puzzles and continue onto the next stage.The music is rather relaxing and don't get old too quickly but after a long while, you may just want to mute it and play your own music instead. The puzzles aren't too hard but will require a bit of your brain to solve.My biggest gripe is control. As you are controlling your little critter around, sometimes it gets confused or locks up and goes back and forth back and forth cause it doesn't really know what you want. Instead of pointing and clicking and your creature going there, you have to hold it, and not al paths are self-evident. The game moves at a very slow pace, so if you're not in a realxed mood, don't bother to play it or you might get frustrated with the slow speed. Personally I think the game has no replay value, but for such a cheap game, did you really expect any?Overall 6/10 - Get it on sale for an interesting mix of art, music and puzzles.
