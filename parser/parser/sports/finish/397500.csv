												Not sure why there are so many positive reviews early on, but here's my two cents. Not a bad RPG, but there are two design flaws that stopped me over 3 hours into this game:-Lack of detail for mission progression: In other words, I saved game, and the next day I forgot what I even needed to do. It was obscure. Going back to important characters did not contain the dialogue to direct me in the right direction. I luckily succeeded by chance and progressed. Story is very confusing and not direct.-Puzzle Mechanism: I could not get out of some puzzles, requiring a full restart. This is a problem, since one of the times I had a lot of progress that went unsaved. Not recommended, when I compare it to the likes of Last Dream.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have mixed feelings about this sequel. First of all, the gameplay is still turn-based RPG, which is exactly what I wanted. The world is the same as the first game, but far more bleak and hopeless (this is not a drawback to me). I got additional party members early on, and I can use one joystick for both movement and menu selection, so those improve on the original! However, I feel like the writing was weaker in the second game, possibly due to the increase in ""zany"" characters, who came off as irritating and not funny at all. I noticed more grammatical errors and exclamation point spam as well, which could mean I'm just being more picky with the sequel. That said, I still enjoyed the gameplay, and most of the puzzles (a few were not intuitive at all, and one made me rage-quit for a day), and I'm curious to see where the story goes from here. If you liked turn-based retro JRPGs, liked the first game, and are willing to put up with some mediocre writing, I'd say you'll like this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Basic InformationTitle:  Labyronia RPG 2Developer:  LabyrinthinePublisher:  Epic Quest GamesGenre:  Classic-style RPGGeneral ImpressionLabyronia RPG 2 picks up the loose ends from the first game and offers us a new map, new quests and characters, while still being as refreshingly open-ended as before. I’m glad the grinding and backtracking issues are now gone and that the writing still manages to slip a joke here and there. With Trading Cards, Achievements and  a storyline that can eat up several good hours, what more can you ask from this wonderfully crafted 2D RPG? Its decent asking price does not reflect the amount of work and thinking that went into the game, that’s a certainty!Strong Points+ Same great storytelling as in Labyronia RPG and less grinding this time around.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- Map seems smaller than the first one in the series.Rating 7/10 This review was submitted for SUPER Giveaways.

												Disclaimer: I was generously given a free copy of Labyronia RPG 2 with the understanding that I was expected to review the title after spending some time with it.       So I must admit that my view of Labyronia 2 is tainted before I even began playing; I had quite the negative experience with the original Labyronia and dove into the sequel only a couple days later. To my surprise, however, it appears that the developers learned a lot from their first title and polished up the sequel accordingly. Kudos on that guys!         Upon launching the game, by default it ran fullscreen and while the resolution was rather unappealing, the assets appeared to be improved enough that it wasn’t unplayable on a 1080p display. Sadly the select button is still inexplicably mapped to the O(PS4)/B(360) by default. Unlike the first Labyronia though, I was actually able to easily fix all the mappings and get a grasp of the games controls before setting off into the world. The opening itself feels like the devs learned a lot from the first game because there was a lot better guidance and exposition in the early game to direct the player. The story was no less generic (the main boss introduced at the beginning was the Father of a thousand evils) but I don’t feel that I have the right to judge much about a direct sequels narrative when I was unable to play the first game.         Overall, Labyronia 2 feels like a great application of lessons learned, but this is where my big picture judgment takes a turn. Yes, most of the originals issues were fixed, but that only brought this game up par with every other RPG Maker title. Die-hard fans of this style of RPG may get some enjoyment out of it, but there’s not that “wow” factor to distinguish it from the thousands of other games just like it flooding Steam.

												DISCLAIMER: I was given a key for free by the publisher!New updates Review after completing Game! (for my original quick first look, just scroll down)Labyronia RPG 2 is a direct sequel to Labyronia RPG taking place roughly 10 years after the incidents of it's predecessor. Thus most of the main cast, many locations and references both cosmetic as well as story wise will make a more sense to players who have completed the first game. At the same time it has to be mentioned that it is possible to play and enjoy this one on it's own without any prior knowledge. A newcomer will make sense of the story and the relations among it's characters.Gameplaywise is where the major differences between Labyronia RPG 2 and 1 will be noticable. Most and foremost is a more streamlined and focused approach in Labyronia RPG 2. While the first game saw the fere leave his house in the beginning and thus threw the player into an open world without any clue where to start and what to do next; as such requiring the player to call the ""oldschool"" ability of being able to explore on there own without any guidance.Here in hte sequel the path forward as well as the objectives are always clear to the player. You will always know where to go to next and what to do!!!The battles however are still dificult, expecially in the beginning and require a careful and strategic approach. Simple attack spamming won't get you anywhere, just as in the Labyronia RPG 1.Overall I can recommend this game to everybody who enjoyed the first one and to fans of the genre who can get past the fact that this is an RPGMaker VXAce game using many default graphics, simply because there is a very nice oldschool style JRPG  beneath it's surface that I enjoyed very much.---Quick First Look!I really like the first Labyronia game, but I still haven't finished it and that is the reason why a quick first look at Labyronia RPG 2 will have to do (at least for now!).Labyronia RPG 2 is still Labyronia!! Everybody who enjoyed the first one will feel right at home.However there is one major change and that is a more focused approach to the game. This time around you will not just be thrown into an open game world without any clues; this time you will be pointed into a specific direction once the short opening sequence that functions as a basic tutorial has been finished.However this doesn't mean that the game has become linear. Whether you are following the directions or just wander off exploring, is still up to you, the player.The game world is still open and once again, careless rushing out will get you into trouble easily and simple attack spamming without any strategy will get you killed as fast as possible (the very first enemy got me, again XD - This is  Spar....errr...Labyronia!!!).

												Stick with Labyronia 1 and don't buy the sequel, it's far less engaging and in my opinion has less desirable features. It feels like a rushed attempt to cash in again on what was a good original game. Labyronia 1 I do recommend however.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

-Quick Review-Labyronia RPG 2 is a RPG developed by Labyrinthine and released Aug 28, 2015. (Lets pause a moment and ask ""why the heck was Labyronia RPG 1 released August 14, 2015 and Labyronia RPG 2 released August 28, 2015? Can you make RPG maker sequels in 14 days? or was this originally supposed to be one whole game? ...That would explain why the sequel starts you off at level 20 or 30. But I'm getting ahead of myself.)synopsis: It's an RPG maker game, you can tell the developers care a great deal about the lore within their game, most people won't read the literal books in it, the sequel has minor improvements which I appreciated being added, like seeing sprites attack in the battle screen. I missed seeing people swing at monsters before numbers pop up.

Community Created Artwork for Labyronia RPG 2

			I'm too lazy to rebind my screenshot, but I'm not too lazy to use my screenshot key, and then paste into photoshop, then upload to community art work. ...Don't... don't think about it.		


-Detailed breakdown review-Story: Welcome back to Labyronia, the story for this series is one of it's strengths (*mumbles* It's an RPG which looks like it's from the Gameboy color days of 1999. It's not like the driving features are going to be it's bedazzling special effects and graphics, or it's revolutionary game physics, or in-game realistic cut sceenes... - not like those are actually aspects all games are to be judged by, but I digress! */end mumbles*)The story is a continuation on Labyronia RPG 1, this makes writing a review a bit sticky, because I first played through the first game before playing this (Actually that's not quite true, I stopped before fighting the 4 or was it 6 'gods'  because I didn't want to grind out the experience and I felt like I was done because I got all the achievements.).My point is, I'm familiar with these characters already, and the game kinda expects you to know who the heck ""Arres"" is, because they're going to talk about Arres alot, because he's kind of a big deal, he's the protagonist in the first game!Basically crap has hit the fan, as the Starks from Game of Thrones warned everyone ""winter is coming"", but it was too late the land was covered in a white blanket faster then you can say ""wait what"". ...I guess that's note quite true because Labyronia RPG 2 takes place 10 years after the original game, but that's not funny to say.You must assemble your party again, and confront the darkness to put an end to this infernal winter. Why did it take them 10 years to do that? I dunno, that wasn't very well explained, or my brain fell asleep. Regardless that's your job now!  And the old ""gods"" are now your friends, so yay! they're just fancy mages that no longer age. that's why I use quotation marks... fakers... Gameplay: Okay, RPG wise, there's not much new which you'll be surprised about. You have gear, you have levels, you have magic, you have elements which are super effective, you have defensive stats, get and equip the right gear before a boss and you'll have minimal trouble. Expect slow progression, some grinding, and random bosses to be hard for no real reason.Oh yeah, pro tip: Equip your gear when you start the game. Because I went against the monster sieging the wall in pretty much my underpants. I won, because I'm Atratzu... but after realizing I took on a huge monster in my underpants I did blush and ask the Captain-of-the-guard to forgive the noobish mistake and promptly restarted the game  and didn't use any items on the first fight my second time through. (how embarrassing!)Other then the regular RPG elements, I don't want to go over all the same details my review for the first game did, so really quickly about the mechanics: You attack, use special abilities which use a secondary source (and depending on the type of character, builds up, or uses like magic), defend, or use items.You can use these to come up with different strategies, yada yada yada blah blah blah... if you don't know how to play an RPG already just google ""best JRPG"" and buy one of those, you'll be an expert in a few hundred hours.I noticed a few big changes from Labyronia RPG 1 and 2, aesthetically speaking these weren't necessary to play the game, but made the game actually feel like I was playing an RPG rather then a no-budget-1-man-first-project (no offense Labyrinthine, just being honest. We all start at the bottom.)You can now see your characters attack! Originally you would chose an attack and you'd just see a swiping animation on the screen to indicate sword attacks, or a particle effect to indicate magic. Now you get to see your cute little sprite walk up to the middle of the screen and then see the animation swipe or sprite attack.   ...Yeah, it's not much, but to gameplay it's a huge improvement! Feels like I have characters fighting, instead of picture frames fighting.Additionally it's worth pointing out you can see your whole party trailing behind you, the more characters you get, the longer your Snake train gets. Not even Final Fantasy 7, Legend of Dragoon, or Pokemon (or other JRPG's I've played and forgotten the title of) did that. Probably because of hardware limitations... but I digress! a cool feature, I liked it... but very much aesthetic.Everything else though...? Pretty much the same as the first game, except for starting out at level 20 or 30 and with Garic (if that's how you spell his name. Truth be told I will forever read his name as ""Garlic"", and so he's endearing to me, my little cranky old-man-vampire-repellent)Conclusion: Well that's probably more words then anyone actually needs to know weather this is a skip or a buy.  Labyronia RPG 2 goes on sale regularly, you can pick it up at a reduced price. There's not much to the game, I highly recommend playing through some of the first game before jumping into the second game. But as far as RPG's go, you could choose a worse RPG maker game.I recommend this game to anyone who misses playing classic JRPG's, and just needs to fill that hole in his or her heart. Have fun and may Garlic be with you.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update August 15, 2016:Click here to check out my Labyronia RPG (origional game) review ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
