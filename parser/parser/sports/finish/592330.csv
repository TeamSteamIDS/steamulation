Roomscale Coaster - Lose weight and your balance dodging platforms in VR !This is an exercise game, you move along a track at breakneck speed and dodge floating platforms, guaranteed to make you sweat!ROOMSCALE / ENVIRONMENT The mountain that serves as the games back drop is very nice, but you will not be looking at that...youll be looking at the large platforms flying towards you at massive speed, these are not so nice and do not feel in keeping with the aesthetic of the mountain, at first thought i was thinking wood beams etc would look nicer but the platforms stand out a lot and that may of been what the dev was trying to do. But yeah the environment while not great is adequate for this type of game.GRAPHICS Passable, not bad, just not amazing, again though with this type of game it is not really the graphics that sell it.PERFORMANCE Amazingly fast, i mean i was moving (or felt like i was) at 100mph and there was no frame rate issues at all, performance was spot on.INTUITIVENESS Apart from a start button placed in such a way that you are facing the wrong way at first (you soon orientate yourself correctly) it was pretty intuitive, the game concept is straightforward….duck and weave or die lol.PROS:  Really good for exercise. Very reasonably priced (about the price of a good coffee). More fun than it really should be.CONS:  If you suffer vr motion sickness then this is not the game for you. Very hard. Very easy to lose your balance or trip on the cable (in fact my test session ended when i jumped back and hit my head on a real wall dodging a virtual one (haptic feedback who needs it!)...i am going to have a lump there that is for sure!)VERDICT If you are looking for a cheap exercise game, you are not prone to vr sickness and you have the good sense to not head butt a wall, then this is worth picking up. That said it is a close call, it may be the concussion starting to set in but i really had to think if to say yes or no to recommending the game and it was only the price that sealed the deal, it is worth the price of a coffee. Now i really need to go and find some ice for the back of my head (could have been worse i could have smacked the vive on the wall, i mean that is pricey to repair, however my head will grow back...right?)

												I was drawn in by the visuals, and I can confirm that the map itself is breathtaking in VR. The track however looks a little out of place and kind of breaks the aesthetics, but it’s not a huge issue as your senses will be pretty occupied with the obstacles ahead. Thanks to the power of VR you’re in for a extreme ride. The platform you’re standing on moves fast, and you have to move really quickly in all directions within your playspace in order not to smack into the walls ahead. Roomscale coaster is the game to play if want to improve your stamina and ducking abilities. It’s simply an excellent workout game that might also give you an adrenalin rush. I played without the comfort option and didn’t feel any nausea, but then again I think my VR feet are pretty much fully grown by now. ",113,33,4,2,21,2,3

												If you want to make use of your room-scale and jump around dodging obstacles like a Ninja, this game is for you. I was falling over and still had a huge smile on my face. It's going to be my new favourite exercise game alongside Climbey VR. Definitely, definitely, worth the price.			",236,57,3,13,26,2,28

												Well well well... Roomscale Coaster....If you'd like to become a ninja with sick reflexes and some awesome moves – this game is for you!! It reminds me a lot of the show – “Hole in the Wall”, but it’s just more about collecting balls for points, and just dodge everything like a ninja. And when I say ninja…. I mean Jackie Chan skills… If you, (Like me), was so excited to get into the game and read nothing of the text that helps you get started – you completely don’t know you can slow down time…. So, I have felled over, hit stuff in my room, and jumped into a wall, all this to just have fun in the game! :D It’s really addicting, you just need to make sure you have a lot of space… AND REMEMBER YOUR ABILITY!! - If not you will fail hard.. – unless you are as good a ninja as I am ;) Fun Addicting But make sure you have enough space to really move around! I Recommend this to others – especially at the low price of 4$/4€			",135,18,9,3,40,2,19

												WOW!!!  Great game and what an extremely hell of a vr ride!!  Simple mechanics and great visuals.  Only one thing I would like to request from the Devs is to add instructions on the menu on what or how the game is played.  It took me a few tries to figure it out but overall a fun game!  Try easy mode first just incase you get the motion sickness issue.  Once you get the hang of it you will like it alot and dare yourself for a faster ride...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
