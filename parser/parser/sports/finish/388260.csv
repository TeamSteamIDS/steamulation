Early Access Review
								Super Slam Dunk Touchdown harkens back to the roots of arcade sports fun.  I would describe it as a combination between Ice Hockey for the NES and NBA Jam.  For anyone who has played either or both of those, you can probably stop reading now and just buy it.  If you haven't played those, imagine a 2 vs 2 or 3 vs 3 arcade sports mashup (of just about every sport) where you can pick different types of athletes with various strengths (e.g., speed, power, and shot types).  There are multiple ways to score, and you can attack opponents and use a short burst of turbo to break for the basket/goal/goal posts.  The matches are quick and frantic and there are plenty of wild distractions like banana peals and even streakers.The sprites are well done and the game is funny in the way that Ice Hockey was.  There's just something about watching goofy sprites pummel one another while dribbling, kicking, and running with an ice hockey puck, and then bouncing the puck off the rim in a botched dunk.  The game doesn't resort to references memes or anything like that - it's just fun and humorous, particularly with a group of friends.I suggest picking the game up and enjoying it with friends (or even alone - the AI is pretty competent) and hop on the forums to encourage the developers to continue to improve the game.  That's what early access is all about, and this game has great potential to be one of the better games to come out of the program. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
