												Unfortunately, the entire game is ruined by terrible hit detection during the battle phases, which are a major part of the game, as well as an inability to change the controls (one important move is done with a combination of buttons for some reason, which is difficult at a fast pace; despite the prevalence of four-button controller layouts since the SNES, the game insists on only using three buttons). Of course, the AI is not hindered by any of these issues. It may play better as a party game, but given these two issues in battle, it would be hard to recommend it even for that.

												Imagine that your task is to describe a Commodore 64 game in an alternate reality where every single Commodore 64 game was purged from existence. Now imagine that, instead of spending an hour writing a bunch of words that people will willfully misinterpret, or filming a tedious hour-long Youtube vlog that nobody is going to watch, you get on your Steam client, navigate to Flag N Frag, and launch it.Imagine your audience experiencing the incredible music, the blocky yet colorful and functional graphics, the gameplay that is vaguely similar to modern gaming yet at the same time odd and vestigial, and the fact that this game is not nearly as fun as you'd imagine, infer, or remember, as the case may be.Congratulations. You've done it. Because this game is the very archetype of a C-64 game. The music is absolutely incredible, it's just a pity that the game itself completely falls apart due to its reliance on a ""battle mode"" that's far too fast-paced and chaotic for a human to do well at, and far too simple for the computer AI. Imagine Pong played at ten times the speed, and you have to hit a button in order to actually deflect the ball. Even against another human it'd be more ""goofy button mashing"" than an out-and-out competition, but against a computer? Forget it, it's not even remotely fun. ",417,119,19,45,80,10,93

Let's Play: Flag N Frag (Review in Description)Â 
A Video of Flag N Frag
By: MF Kraven

			Usually don't upload videos on Saturday, but I made a special exception for this game. Thank you to VAIDA ALICE, JUANSTERTHEMONSTER & Special K for helping me film my first Let's Play.		


MF KRAVEN REVIEW:Flag n Frag is a 1-4 player couch combat game that combines elements of capture the flag &  pong, all set in a futuristic cyber punk type boardgame. The objective of the game is to have the most flags, most frags, the most cheat coins(which you can get from fragging an opponent), fewest units lost and most crown points by the end of the sixth round. Graphics, sound & artstyle: first and foremost the artstlyle while it has become the favorite style of many game developers of later still manages to remain charming. I found all the characters on the game to be an excellent addition to the lore of the game. Sound while often repetitive had me feeling nostalgic, feeling like I was 8 years old playing with my Sega listening to 8 bit music with a fresh new twist. GAMEPLAY:The core gameplay centers around a board where 4 teams compete to dominate the board with flags that can be captured as long as they are blank or unlocked. Walk right over a flag and get a point, or challenge an opponent to a game of futuristic pong and try to ""Frag"" him/her to get coins and get a point for fragging them or also score by getting the crown and for every turn you have it get a point. PRICE:For retail 2.99 USD you get a hidden gem. I've had the game for about a week and see not enough people playing Flag n Frag.AMOUNT OF GAMEPLAY:a typical Flag N Frag match will last anywhere between 25-35 minutes. a great amount of time for such a complex boardgame. I do wish we could set the amount of rounds to be played however, against friends 6 is perfect but I see myself playing this game with friends and getting really into it, anywhere between 10-12 rounds would be amazing. CONS:-matches against bots always seem unfair, as good as you get. which is good in some ways, but often times just frustrating.-small variety of maps-hit detectionn in battle phase sometimes feels bad especially against bots-no onlineBUY IT, WAIT FOR SALE or DON'T BUY:while it has minor details that need some tweaking, this game is a perfect example of what Indie Devs should be delivering. For $2.99 USD the game is a classic. I give it a BUY IT. I would strongly recommend it for people who have friends to play with. To those who don't, it's still a CHALLENGING board game.
