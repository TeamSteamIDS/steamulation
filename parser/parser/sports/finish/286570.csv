												So far I have been left with a bitter taste in my mouth and cannot recommend this game... yet.Pros:The graphics and optimisation. I have a FX-8320 and a GTX 970. I'm getting 60+ FPS with the whole grid on ultra.The handling model. I have a G27 and I am happy with the FFB and the physics have vastly improved, especially compared to F1 2014.Cons:No safety car. I don't know Codemasters reasoning for this but I personally feel it takes away from the game.This game crashes more than Maldonado. Ran a benchmark, crashed. Tried online, crashed. Started pro season mode, crashed. You get the idea.Littered with bugs. For now there is only one that I find truly game breaking. When I play Pro season mode, (for those who dont know, it is supposed to turn off all HUD and assists and locks you into cockpit cam) I still have all the assists on and since the menu is greyed out I can't manually turn them off.I would advise anybody interested in this game, to be patient and wait for future fixes and then consider a purchase.May update this in the future. 10/07/15------------------------------------------------------------24 hours of game time later I feel it is time to update my review.First off, since my first review they released a 2nd patch on the day of release, which is pathetic that it was even needed in the first place as it wasnt even a large one. Thankfully though it seems to have fixed the game crashing so Pastor can now sit safe and keep his reputation.The more I have driven in this game the more and more I'm enjoying racing the AI and the handling model. The Championship season, Quick race and Time trial modes are the ONLY parts of the game I would consider ready to be released. Pro season and Multiplayer however were and STILL ARE NOT READY.For the first time in the series you can actually race the AI wheel-to-wheel, and unlike Project Cars there aggresion is about right. The AI are very spacially aware so if you were to dive up there inside they won't turn in on you. They are also very racey themselves as they wont back out 100 metres before a braking zone as before, and will try to outbrake you if you leave the door open. For reference I have the AI on the hardest setting.However I would consider Championship season mode ready,although it does have a few features missing. You can no longer underfuel the car in this game and since you can no longer run rich fuel mix for longer than half a lap before your engine overheats, I end up with around 5 laps of fuel left at the end of a 100% race. You can no longer fully customize your strategy before the race, you can only choose between preselected strategies given to you by your teams strategist and with 100% races, generally speaking you're given 2 options but if you qualify within the top 10 it's normally 1. My final complaint with Championship season mode is the inability to customize the weekend length. There are 3 choices and cant be tweaked. Short weekend- 15 mins practice, one-shot qualifying, 25% race. Normal weekend- 30 mins practice, one qualifying round, 50% race. Long weekend- 1 hour practice, full 3 rounds of qualifying, 100% race.Quick race works as it should with you being able to actually tweak it to your liking and there's not much else to say. Time Trial has been improved upon now as at most circuits/corners the game is strict with you leaving track limits, but my new favourite feature is you can copy setups from people at the top of the leaderboards. I highly recommend doing this unless you want to be left alone and know what you're doing. My only problem with Time Trial is that at some corners you can still exceed track limits and not have your lap invalidated. Is it really that hard code""masters"" to just invalidate laptimes if you exceed track limits with all 4 wheels regardless of time lost/gained?I feel the need to mention at this point that the F1 2014 season is also included in this game as I'm rather neutral to its integration. Albeit a nice bonus, I bought this game for the 2015 season and would rather have had them focus more time on the current season than the previous one.The problem with Pro season mode mentioned in my first review is still there and upon further review  I think there was no real need for Codemasters to even add this mode as you can change your HUD, assist and camera angle in Championship season mode to the exact same settings.Now the real big-hitter that is Multiplayer. Blandly put, the multiplayer is a mess, there's no two ways about it. From unpredictable ghosting, to desynchonised lobbies, to driving through pit crews, to just straight up random teleporting, multiplayer is completely and utterly broken. With a supposed brand-new netcode, which showcases Codemasters ""master"" coding, multiplayer has been crippled before even mentioning there new matchmaking system known as ""hoppers"". The main problem with the new system is the player base gets spread out so much between the different game types that it takes so much longer to find the game even in the first week since release.After having played the game for a longer time period now, I would only recommend this game to people if you are only/mainly interested in the singleplayer experience. If Multiplayer was the main attraction stay clear as if it was a sprintmode lap 1 trainwreck of a pileup.Further updates pending upon release of further patches or DLC. 14/07/15			",61,1,6,6,3,0,0

												Dear Codemasters,What the hell? I have been a loyal fan of your racing games since 2007, but what is it with the F1 series? All the opporunity and all the promise and in every release problem after problem after problem. The most stable of the series was probably 2012 (though no FP1 and FP2 and the wet-to-dry transition problems still hurt). F1 2015 - released 2 months earlier than has been typical, and it's not ready for distribution. Let's make a simple and, I think, fair comparison: - DiRT Rally - came with some bugs, but that was the point right? I mean, it was touted as an Early Release title for which the community feedback has been integral to QAing the game as such that you have been able to appropriately focus your development efforts, and it's worked - immaculately. And... For those of us who got in early, we paid what, 60% of the cost of a full release?- F1 2015 - where to begin. Evidently from a development perspective, QA cycles have been all but completely omitted it seems. Some of the graphical elements are certainly more polished, and the handling model is refined, but otherwise, this bad-boy is completely smattered with issues. I am running an i7 5820 w/ 64 GB DDR4 and 2 GTX 970s in SLI and I am getting significant amounts of ""blur"" at assorted points throughout gameplay - not only while driving - it really doesn't look great. I tried ""Reset To Track"" and my car jumped around in reverse, smoked a wall and came to rest backwards on the track - that was an effect I was able to reproduce. The AI continuously drive up from behind me and smoke me like I'm not even there, sending me off track, damaging my car, and even penalising me. In just two hours of gameplay I had a crash when running benchmark mode, a random crash in the middle of a lap, 2 instances where when I started the game it was unresponsive to keyboard inputs for minutes, timing screens which flicker, setup screens which overlay one another making it virtually impossible to read the two conflicting layers of text, and a desaturated (almost to the point of being entirely greyscale) camera view once I used a flashback. All the points about ""I can't make my own character"", I personally couldn't care (well, aside from missing the helmet which I have used since F1 2010!), but the base playability MUST be there for full release, and in this case it isn't. Oh, and what's up with giving us PC'ers the option to try to use the voice commands if the functionality was never intended for the platform - it almost seems ""mean"" - queue up that fat Nelson kid from The Simpsons. It's unfortunate that ""the pinacle of motorsport"" is not represented appropriately, but I guess with the ""state of F1"" being what it is, what else can be expected? DiRT, DiRT 2, DiRT Rally, GRID - all amazing unforgettable titles, but F1 - the series has not been executed to the extent it should have been once yet. That's $360 I have been stupid enough to spend on not a single product which actually worked through and through. At this point I am officially turned off as I expect 50% - 60% of the community is, or will be over the coming days, based on the forums so far. It's a sad day...**UPDATED**More issues:Multiplayer - constant screen flickering - not changes to the settings from when I play in Championship or Pro Season modes. Engineer - I cannot hear a word my engineer says even with the car and environment turned down to 50 and the Speech to 100. Quit Game - Every time I go to quit game, Steam looks as though it's DLing a patch or something, prior to me getting an Error 41. Multiplayer - obviously not a glitch / bug, but Codies, did you really make the decision to include a Custom Multiplayer season where AI racers were not included? Like, I want to do the full season (co-op or adversarial) with a friend, but I can only race him... Yeah, there's no AI - how fun is that? And otherwise I have to find another 18 people to fill the grid and be online for Practice, Qually, and Race distances...			",15,5,11,5,16,0,8

												I've been playing this series for 3 years and this game probably has the best physics basis of the series but the rest is fiasco. No safety car&virtual safety car, no realistic track limit violation rules, no drive through penalty, completely terrible online system (game constantly causes mass disconnection at certain points) and optimization (especially in online) is terrible. I don't even want to mention no career option.I heard that Codemasters will take some pre-alpha or beta testers from the real players. If Codemasters keep listening 12-year-old arcade-lover English children who are moaning about ""auto-spin"" kerbs because they spin on a freaking kerb while using full throttle, this series will lose its only good feature: physics.You need to make driving hard (even more understeer because cars are still bloody fast - almost 3 seconds faster than real life, stiffer suspensions, less grip off the racing line, less grip on the racing line in wet surface - because of the rubber - etc.), make online more stable, provide more freedom (driver customization, maybe increasing driver ability options in career mode, also in season development), introduce realistic track limit rules and more strict penalties.Edit: Well, after the patch that includes ""strict corner cutting rules"", I have to revise my review. This game still lacks in almost all the fields I explained above. But they listen to us - they added strict corner cutting rules. And now, beta testers give great feedbacks about the game. In F1 2016, there will be safety car and proper career mode. Also, kerbs will be more punishing, throttle application will be harder, ideal racing line and braking points will make more difference, car setups will be even more effective in F1 2016 (F1 2015 responds changes in car setups pretty well in my opinion, they are on the correct path at least). I hope it will be more satisfying in all aspects.P.S.: By the way, those in previous paragraph are not my predictions. They are actual feedbacks and observations of one of the beta testers.

												CM F1 games have been disappointing since 2012, the only reason i bought this is because of how much i enjoy watching this sport and I wasn't hoping for much when I bought it but F1 2015 has stooped to a new low.The good:*Enhanced AI, they're actually racing each other (however they make no mistakes) and they will try aggressive moves.*Different cars and different engine manufacturers handle quite differentilyThe bad:*Game crashes randomly (and this is after the crash fixing patch)*Horribly optimized graphics, I can run GTA V on ultra yet i can't run this on high with a stable fps, suddenly i find the game dropping from 60 to 20 out of nowhere.*Game freezes for milliseconds after you look back and unfreezes at 2x speed when you return to normal view*Unrealistic rules, you can start on fresh set of tyres instead of quali tyres*Co-op mode removed*Safety car removedand the steaming horse♥♥♥♥♥♥*""Career"" mode*Unable to customize the sessions in career mode, why can't i have a 25% race with full qualifying?? you had that feature already why did you remove it?I'm really hoping the reviews will be so negative that CM will lose the rights to F1, we could use some decent devs to create a playable F1 game or at least get CM to fix this broken port because so far they have disregarded all of their customers.

												In 4hrs of play time so far, this game has crash more often that my 8hrs in Batman AK. Needs to patch the several issues raised in the forums. Fundamentally the racing is fun, AI on legend will test your abilities (and frustration since they love to hit you in the back), but several issues make this a love, hate thing at the moment. I would suggest buying if you're in desperate need of an F1 game, if not hold off your purchase till it's fixed (if ever) and/or a price drop.Pros:=AI much more competitive that previous game, sometimes overly so.=Graphically looks good and runs at a stable and good fps (Avg ~110 for me) on 1440p, 980Ti.Cons:=Damage model severly underwhelming (Go full speed into a wall and you will be shocked at what happen, in a bad way)=Stuck at 2nd gear after exiting the pits, unable to up or downshift until the end of the white line at the side=No race weekend weather info in championship mode (Spent practise optimising dry setup only to be greeted with a wet qualy. Game crashed during qualy, load back and it suddenly became a dry qualy)=No career mode and safety car=AI loves to crash into you from the back.=Can't find any online lobbies to play*Updated on 11 Jul to include more cons.

												Positives:- Very competitive A.I.- Decent physics (Better than F1 2014).- Better graphics than previous F1 games.- 2014 season is included. The best feature!!111!1!!one!1!one11!!Negatives:- Bad online experience.- Lack of gamemodes.- No career mode. Yes you can play the championship mode but you don't have team contracts and the other career mode features. It's different.- Still the graphics are not that great.- Bad optimization.- Bad damage model.Conclusion: It doesn't worth it to buy it for 50 euros. You'd better wait for a steam sale period and get it for less money. Codemasters can make a good F1 game but they seem to be pretty lazy or they didn't have enough time to finish it.............I'm so done with this game...			",60,2,18,0,10,2,1

												An all around disappointment. Although being an improvement from the already mediocre F1 2014, this game feels like a major let down by Codemasters. Lots of promises from them and they fail to deliver once again.PROS :-Handling model and steering has been slightly improved from 2014 with the new engine-New engine brings nicer graphics and more details to the environment-Engine sounds are as good as the real thing-AI are less passive and way more aggressive, will race you and pursue their overtaking manouver till the end-Team radio has been enhanced, and the talk to engineer voice recognition is a great ideaCONS :-Major lack of features. This game feels absolutely bland. It really hurts to see Career mode gone. Championship mode let you choose an existing driver and pretty much do their season. Gone are the days where your name would shine on the podium along big names in the sport. Pro season is pretty much a Preset Championship mode with 100% Race laps, Legend AIs and manual gears. So much for a feature right ? Multiplayer on your own is nearly impossible, nobody plays this game by the looks of it, every time you'll try to get in a Hopper session, you'll end up in a lobby by yourself and AIs. And even if you can get a few people in the lobby, the races are absolutely hideous. It feels more like a cheap Mario Kart game. Fortunately, Time Trial is still here (thank god for that) and that's about it.-No safety car. No need to explain. Why remove it ? We will never know.-AI is absolutely dumb. It was a good thing to make them competitive, but they are aggressive to the point of ignoring you on the track. I had so much drama on race starts because of the AI not taking into consideration that you are on the track and they will just push you out of the way. Before F1 2015, the AI was very defensive and weak, but the beauty of it was that they actually knew that you were on the track. On this game, it feels like they are stuck on a rail just like old racing games from the 1990's. -Damage model is non existant. Yeah, sure, if you hit the wall at least 50 times and end up losing a wheel, I guess that's what damage model is for Codemasters. Jokes aside, you'd think that in 2015, damage model would be on point and realistic with flying debris compared to older racing games but nope, ain't got time for that, right Codemasters ? You can hit the wall at 300+ kph, you'll probably just lose a wheel and the front wing, that's it. If you collide into a wall at 200kph, you'll lose your front wing, and that's about it...-Handling model and steering is appauling. When you get an oversteer, you feel like you're steering a boat. Yes, a boat. It's nearly impossible to correct a tiny oversteer or understeer just like you see in real life. When you overtake and go wheel to wheel against someone, just one hit makes you spin and go sideways. It is very frustrating. Just a tiny hit and you're off in the gravel on the opposite side of the track. VERDICT :When I was a kid playing F1 1997 on PSOne, I thought that it was the best Formula One game ever made.23 years later, I still feel like it was one the best game ever made. We are in 2015 and this game feels like a cheap excuse to release a licenced F1 game. Would be a good arcade game for younger players or people who don't have a deep knowledge of Formula One.I'm a hardcore fan and I feel like this is a disgrace to our community. I've dreamed of so much better.The game could be so much better, but nobody is dedicated enough to make it.Codemasters should lose their contract with the FIA and let another passionate studio take over the franchise and rebuild everything from scratch and make a game that actually feel like the real thing.

												EDIT 12/07/2015:So today I was excited to begin a full championship season with Williams.I selected the Championship mode, selected Legend difficulty.Like every other F1 game, I wanted to do a 25% race, with full qualifying.Well in F1 2015 you can't. If you want full qualifying, you have to do a 100% race. WHY? Why can I choose my qualy length in a single race, but not in a championship mode?Eventually I concede to doing one-shot qualy, not the end of the world.I land in the pits in Australia - the frame rate has gone to♥♥♥♥♥♥ I exited the pit lane to a 10FPS mess.I ran a race around Silverstone on high settings at excellent frame rates yesterday, what is going on?I turned the graphics settings to low and restarted, frame rate was back to 60 FPS, but it looked horrid. Increased to medium settings - back to 10 FPS.I am done. I am requesting my refund. As you can see from my initial review below, I was willing to give the game a chance.This is unacceptable, I will not be buying a Codemasters game again.I will be playing the F1 mod on Assetto Corsa if anyone needs me.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------After the disapointment of F1 2014, I expected much better this time around. CM had a lot of extra time to get this right, given how little focus was given to F1 2014I am running the game on an i5 4690k, R9 280x and from and SDD, haven't had any performance issues or crashes yet.The FFB on my G27 is average, not much feeling in low speed corners, but after 20 laps of Silverstone I am OK with it. Physics are what I expected from a CM F1 game more or less. The graphics are very disappointing, PC looks worse than the gameplay videos on youtube for PS4 and XB1. There is a weird blur on everything, nothing looks sharp.Sound is poor, isnt well mixed.I am going to keep the game, there is a solid base to be built on, hopefully CM patch it quick.This seems to be a rushed PC port. I am giving thumbs down until these issues have been resolved.Can't say I would recommend the game, but my experience is definitely not as bad as others.			",29,2,9,4,3,0,1

												Having purchased F1 games from the year dot and played all of them from Geoff Crammonds Revs right up to the recent Codemasters run (2010 to 2014) I was thrilled to see the new one come out much earlier and with a brand new engine. How disappointed I was when I finally got to play it. Where to start with the issues...Handling: It's impossible. Even for an experienced racer like me, it's utterly impossible. The car randomly vears off the track at sudden intervals that make little to no sense (on power, not on power, sometimes mid corner, sometimes late corner, sometimes on entry) its impossible to predict or correct in many instances without adding more grass to the tyres. I get it, you want it to be realistic, but lets face it, unless you are Pastor Maldonado, this is far from realistic.Forget setting up controls either, it seems Codemasters decided we didnt need those options... And my wheel just simply refuses to be detected other than as a gamepad (!!!).The menus are ridiculous too, its really really hard to navigate. It makes little to no sense and doesnt even match the previous versions of the game, so its like trying to learn something new all over again, it just adds to the sense of frustration while playing it. If that wasn't bad enough, when you start a game, the usual ESC button used in every other menu, doesnt do anything (!!!) instead I had to smash many keys until a menu came up (its P by the way).The graphics aren't even very good either, despite running a very high end PC with 16gb of ram and 970 graphics card. It looked worse than last year...Then there is the season part. Taken away completely and replaced by a single season system where you drive as one of the current drivers. Why can't I use my own damn name and race across many seasons like in previous years games?It feels like they've taken away all the flexibility of the old games, replaced the engine with something worse and made the menu system infuriating.I haven't even mentioned constant frame dips and stuttering during actually trying to stay on the track.This should be renamed ""ice truck simulator 2015"" but then perhaps that title would actually be fun instead of feeling like I've had my testicles squashed in a vice while having vinegar poured in my face (something I'd rather have than play this game in its current state).

												Codemasters! We make one step forward and dozens backwards at the same time!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------They make me feel bad and ashamed about working in the same industry!QUOTE ""Skidmeister"":F1 Race Stars is a better Formula 1 game than this......I have been a fan of Codmasters F1 and Dirt series games since the first release. I preordered this game with the information that I read over the internet from reviewers and from the Codies website. I also used my previous experience with Codmasters F1 games as a basis on what type of quality to expect from a game like this one. I have previously purchased Dirt, Dirt 2, Dirt 3, F1 2010 thru 2014 from Steam and for the most part was happy with my purchase. I am also a fan of other racing titles that are more sim than game such as IRacing, Project cars. I have enjoyed playing Race 07, Asetto Corsa except the game server on Asetto Coursa is a joke. I spent many hours in Papyrus titles like GPL and their Nascar series , and also on Geoff Crammonds World Circuit thru his GP4. I have seen both the good and bad of all these titles at their best and worst. I did not set my expectations for F1 2015 any higher than what I had seen them previously release.Common sense would dictate that a company that has been making F1 games for the PC since their September release in 2010 would have a good handle on what it takes to get a game ready to market. Common sense need not apply here. It seems with the release of F1 2015 Codmasters has indeed returned to it's roots......console gaming. This title was written with that customer in mind. The control menus are a joke with no punchline. I was never able to get both my CSW V2 wheel and Richmotech real race gear pedals to work at the same time. It is a game that really does not have a target audience and does not know where to fit in. With a shameful lack of content considering what was in previous releases, there is no safety car, interviews, career mode, co-op mode, or classic F1 cars. The sheer scarcity of options and modes means this is yet another year where the ""Official F1 tie-in"" never even gets to the starting grid. The amount of modes left out of this title is borderline criminal and scandalous. It feels like less than half a game was released at a premium price no less. They ""throw in"" the 2014 season as a bonus, because it's obvious they intend to BONE US with this title and the absense of so much of what should be seen as standard for F1. This publisher is so hell bent on hitting it's yearly release schedule that it pulled this one out of the oven half baked.I run a high end system and love to see titles push that hardware for what its worth. My current rig features a core !7-5960, 64 gb ddr4, (2) Titan X video cards in SLI, 2 ASUS G-sync 27"" monitors at a res of 5890 x 1080 bezel corrected @144 hz. Aparently I would have had better results on a console system with this title. It crashed the first few times I ran a benchmark test so bad I needed to reload my video drivers and recalibrate the monitors as this game had them stuck in limbo after multiple crashes. This game crashes more than Maldonado and Grosjean combined. The graphics looked bad even when I got them to display, but they were constantly blinking and flashing, seemingly fishing for a proper state of display this catastrophy of a game could not deliver. It looked like it was snowing in Singapore and it nearly caused me to have suffer a seizure from the constant screen blinking. Because I never was ablle to get my wheel and pedals working at the same time, even though they worked fine in all their previous titles, I can not comment on the physics. The track textures have a filtery feeling that left me nausiated as well. This game is so awkwardly stylized it's more like a bad cartoon Anime, than a racing title.I would have to say that afer a few hours of utter frustration spent trying to fix all the problems that run rampant with simple setup of this game, that the quit menu works great and that's about all. Also thats what I suggest, quit buying these half baked mess and let Codemasters know it no excuses as it is not their first rodeo, but could be their last. The best thing to do with this game is delete it permantly from your drive. There are plenty of good titles that offer proper racing that works to deal with this junk. Return it and get a refund while you can.In a side note to STEAM, shame on you too. I have been a customer for over 8 years and have never even tried to return a title. I tried multiple times to get a refund on this as I was never able to complete even one lap, but was told that beacause I had more than 2 hours of trying to fix this worthless piece of junk, that they would not refund my money. Instead opting to join their co-conspirator Codmasters in ripping of a loyal customer for short term profit. Shame on you STEAM and Codmasters, I have purchased many of your products and recommended them to my friends, alas my policy is changed on that too. I will NEVER pre purchase a title again with this return policy. I had always believed that STEAM treated their customers fairly and with respect, but I see this was yet another lesson learned from this terible gaming experience.Your money would be much better spent on the 2012 or 2013 Codemasters F1 games than this abortion of a game. I would recommend Project Cars or IRacing to anyone looking for a Racing Sim.Had either of those titles offered all the cars or tracks from the current F1 season I would have never bothered with this lackluster castrophy in the first place. Save your money and buy something else.			",284,25,25,19,11,1,20

												I've been playing the CM F1 games since 2012. 2015 is the worst of all of them. The amount of features has been scaled back too much. The graphics engine is an improvement in some ways, but is also a bit more blury. There are also quite a few graphical glitches/flickering (like grass) in spots. The AA settings are a real bummer (no more magnitude setting). None of the new console voice command features are available on the PC/Steam version. Force feedback was supposed to be improved, but it's not any better (if not worse) than 2014. But the worst is the huge amount of bugs. The game is relatively unstable. I get in-game crashing periodically, and it will ALWAYS crash when I exit. I really wanted to like this game. But it's a real disappointment. I'd return it if I didn't buy on GMG. My mistake.EDIT: To be fair, I should list some pros over the last version (2014): -The new MP options are definitely a step in the right direction, especially classifying by difficulty. -The new ""rival"" appearance in Time Trial is awesome. -Graphically it's a step sideways: It's less sharp, but overall it's prettier. Things could get a lot better with some serious patches. However, the past F1 games have had glaring bugs through their entire life, so I'll be surprised if F1 2015 is fixed-up like it should be.EDIT 2: Wait... No Track IR support? Are you kidding me? This has been a basic feature of the series for at least 4 years. Stay away from this game. Stay FAR away.			",138,31,19,5,13,1,23

												DO NOT BUY THIS!!!Worst game Codemasters have ever released!This is not a finished products - it's an engine demo, prototype, pre-alpha crap.Avoid it like a plague. For those miserable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s for whom this game actually runs, this what it's like:-- Controls are a mess. You cannot adjust most primitive control settings - button remaping for predefined controllers; deadzones, sensitivity, saturation etc for custom controllers. Hell there IS NO SUPPORT for custom controllers AT ALL!!! The game does not have any settings unless you have Logitech G27, 29 or equivalent. It's unplayable even with X360 controllers, because wheel just don't turn in, you cannot adjust sensitivity and car will get stuck in most narrow corners, scraping walls. Monaco is unplayable without high-end gaming wheels. ♥♥♥♥ing literally!-- Still on controls, they become unresponsive on random occations. Steering just becomes unresponsive, because ♥♥♥♥ you that why!-- AI ignores player and rules. Blue flags are for♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI will not let you pass, and even fight you for position.AI loves to ram player and everything else on the track. They will push you into walls and off the track. Multiplayer seems more civil.-- speaking of multiplayer - it does not work! At all! You might get into one game every hour. There are no proper custom game lobbies, just quick jump in games. Net code is all over the damn place. Players do not sync at all. Everybody blinking all over the road, running into invisible walls and cars, changing positions etc. And you get kicked out of lobbies 9/10 times. --penalty system works in random mode. It will penalize you when you don't do anything illigal, or when AI is actually to blame. AI will bump into you, and you will recieve warnings and penalties for that. Other times it will not register anything. Even when you cut entire corners.--The new Pro mode is just regular championship mode on hard. Laziest  and most useless game mode I've ever seen.--There is no career mode anymore. No more signing teams or anything. Just get into a car and drive - season, single race or time trial. that's it. Multiplayer does not even count, because it does not work.--it does not look all that good for a new engine. Hey, have you seen Project Cars? People are in the deepest hole in uncanny valley. FPS drops for no reason. -- I haven't seen more unfinished game in a very long time. And 3 weeks after release, almost nothing has been fixed. fun times!  Just read the community hub!This should not be released for another year or two. This is not a finished product! Not even close. Not even ""beta"" finished. Not even ""early access"" finished! Come back after a year... oh wait, then there will be F1 2016 game?!Edit: Over a month since the release. Still nothing has been fixed. Now multiplayer does not work at all anymore. So it actually got worse.			",346,80,39,37,30,3,57

												I expected so much more. When Codemasters said: ""We took Mercedes' stance with regard to taking a gap year like they did in 2013 to make 2014 amazing, we did the same in 2014 to make 2015 out of this world"". But they haven't. They've taken a step back. There are constant crashes. There's still no parade lap. There's no more safety cars. Worse yet - there's no career mode for drivers who wish to live the F1 dream. They've recommended a GTX 970 as a GPU - which I have, yet the game looks smudgy at best. Sure it runs fluidly in 60 FPS, but cut scenes and replays are at 30 FPS. The bugs like missing championship points in the full season after the game crashes is pathetic. I had a 40 point lead in the championship after the game crashes, and started Round 10 with all the drivers on 0 points. But the MOST irritating thing - you can't do 25% races with full practice sessions or full qualifying. I have 300+ games to play on Steam, I don't have time to do a full race. Let me race at 25% and enjoy your game, and let me do 3 quali runs like I used to do. Is that too much to ask? You're losing my faith, Codies. I bought this game in the same hour it went on pre-order on Steam, even before you announced that it was for sale on Facebook. They've really let us down.			",272,83,51,25,66,3,43

												A game filled with promises from the developers, only to turn out to be the same old song and dance for the sixth time in a row.Somehow codemasters manage to improve one aspect of their game every year, and that's it. They find new ways to remove immersion, reduce feeling & distance you away from a solid experience.I've heavily defended this series and the developers every year since the inception of the F1 series at Codies. But this is embarrassing.The Pros:The cars are much more controllable and the handling feels much better than the last iteration.The UI is a big improvement.The Cons:The AI is awful, The Force Feedback is numb,The game is filled with graphics bugs and frame drops (frame drops unacceptable in a racing game),The anti aliasing turns on some kind of weird hazey glow around everything,The tyres don't feel like they're in contact with the road, they float about,Menus are still navigated with arrow keys, a clear sign of a direct port from console to PC,Removal of safety car,Removal of career mode,Terrible animations and awful character models.There are many more cons to pros in the game. Overall if you've played any of the other F1 games, you've played this game. Hundreds of hours into the series & nothing improves.			",110,10,29,9,21,2,11

Posted: September 3, 2015
												So the time has come. After extensive gameplay, I can finally get my conclusions on this game. Yep, it's a thumbs up review against 60% negative reviews... ouch.Okay, let's go. The first point of disappointment around the community is the lack of content that Codemasters had been announcing since October last year. They basically said that physics and handling were taken to a new level of realism, graphics were made realistic and detailed thanks to an all new engine, the player would be more involved in the action thanks the larger variety of cutscenes, a new team radio system with which you can actually interact with the engineer, 2014 season for free, more online modes, two brand new full championship modes, car technical updates as they come in real life... Promising, isn't it? If we look into the game and play it, the guys at Codemasters haven't said a lie. Well, just one: They haven't laid any car update since the day-1 patch, which included team Manor and McLaren's new livery  (what about the new Mercedes rear wing, Force India nosecone, McLaren new short nosecone, Ferrari new sidepods...?). With that exception, everything they said is in the actual game.  - Handling, physics and tyre model is just amazing. Seriously, it really is. F1 games are no longer a lazily built arcade with random curb spin and nonexistent grip feel on turns and braking points, but and incredibly detailed simulator-like which transmits the power of the cars in all its glory. Now you have torque wheelspin which you can correct with quick steering movements to put the car straight and make it find grip, which makes the car nervous as in real life. - Some people moan about the inability to change dead zone and saturation setups on wheels and pads. I have mixed opinions about that: For compatible devices like the Xbox 360/One pad or the main wheels on the market like Logiteg G27/29 or certain Thrustmaster devices the developer has brought a preset setup which adapts to what they want the game to handle like. Change the settings and you completely ruined the car behaviour. On the other hand, this has a drawback. If you have a wheel which hasn't got a preset, forget about ever trying to use it with this game. It would be nice to set up a comfortable setting for it because Force Feedback will mess around and steering will be completely unrealistic and close to impossible. - Most PC users report constant bugs. I haven't found any type of glitch during my gameplay, of any kind. Try checking out your GPU drivers before directly blaming the game. Some Youtubers and users make ""bug compilation"" videos and screenshots of gross bugs with the initial version of the game, without the Day-1 patch. That's not fair, and don't take them into account. If you really want to get feedback about glitches, ask people, document yourself with patch fixes and the PC those users have and their drivers version. Again, I haven't found any bug in like 40 hours of gameplay. - Setups are much deeper and they change realistically the behaviour of the car, mostly because the physics take into account many more real-time factors like, say, a fully working weight balance system. Now it comes with five setup presets which you can choose to adapt the car to the circuit you are at plus you can save your own. Tyre model is now enhanced and integrates a much more complex tyre wear system, so choosing the right setup makes a huge difference in tyre management.  - As to graphics, what they made was basically go back to the F1 2010 model which consisted in using light effects to make beautiful and realistic scenes, but of course they've enhanced textures, added some nice motion blur, a long awaited ambient occlusion and refined colours. Rain effects are also enhanced and rather impressive, and night circuits have a much more accurate reflections and lighting effect.  - Sounds make a big difference and are probably one of the fields that have been worked out the most. The engine has an impressive range of sounds, from the dynamic roar of the V6 along the revs panorama to the subtle whistle of the turbo, including the electric engines' distinctive sound. Aero sounds are more detailed and go further from the strange noise that sometimes appeared on the previous games when attempting to make it. There's the reverb of the sound when getting close to walls and barriers and more detailed tyre squeak, among other cool effects. Team radio is at its best, providing useful information and with a larger variety of sentences. Now let's move to the drawbacks, because it doesn't matter how much you're enjoying this game, they're there as a wound. Where to begin... Oh, yeah. The optimization.Unlike the rest of the games by Codemasters, F1 2015 is really, really, really badly optimised (I mean, really). Seriously, I don't know what they did there. Frame rate will be the same on the lowest settings as on the Highest, and some tracks have some nasty drops at some points. Pit Stops are somehow capped to some ridiculous 15 FPS and after leaving the pit lane you're back at the normal frame rate. Thank God you haven't got to do anything during pit stops, because otherwise it would have been impossible. Some patches have improved performance and frame rate is more stable now. Game is fully playable though, so no need to panic. I'd take the excuse that this is their first title under the all-new-bright-and-shiny graphics engine so they haven't had enough time to make it as perfect as the previous EGO engine was by the last games it powered...  - Online. Man, this is by far the worst part of the game. Well, you can't even say it is a part of the game, because it's just broken. As if it wasn't there. No online. One of the additions to this game is, as said before, a new bunch of online game modes, ""hoppers"" as they call them. These are simply preset lobbies, so you can enter any type of race you want. Looks good, huh? Nope. It doesn't make it easier to find the exact race setting you want, although not because of the game, but the very few people that switches to online. Enter a hopper: No lobbies. Different hopper: No lobbies. Another hopper: Enter a lobby. Lobby already racing ( -.- ).There's also the custom match lobby, of course, but for some reason it cannot be public (only friend invite). Don't want to lose time searching open lobbies and you just want to go online? NOPE! For some reason, they removed the ""Joker"" of Quick Matchmaking. Manage to enter a lobby and start racing? NOPE! Bound to be kicked from session. To be fair, Codemasters has never had proper servers. 70% of the times in F1 2012 you or anyone else in the lobby would get Disconnected. DiRT 3 was glitchy at some points. But these issues in F1 2015 aren't even normal. - The lack of Safety Car, to be honest, doesn't make any difference at all. I have around 200 hours of playtime in F1 2012 and most of the time I play 25%-50% races. Haven't seen a single Safety Car. If so, some red flags. If from 2012 to 2014 the Safety Car was as common as seeing a four-leaved shamrock, why not having it in 2015 is a big deal? My point of view is that the damage system is so bad that there's no reason to lay the Safety Car on track. Massive incident, front wing and wheels off, car and parts disappear, resume racing. With the new graphics engine they could have enhanced the damage system to add debris on track that could cause punctures, gravel spread on the tarmac, marshals picking up pieces... In those occasions it would be easier and reasonable to deploy the Safety Car, but as the damage system only added more realism on flatting tyres against walls and more parts of the front wing that you can lose, there's no reason to do. That's a disappointing drawback, the damage system.F1 2015 is enjoyable. You'll notice the difference to the previous games from the first moment. 7.5/10			",81,10,13,2,6,1,3

												Its moments like this you realise that PC doesn't matter to developers. While the console versions ships with few issues, the PC version is just broken for some people which to me says that the game just wasn't tested enough... if at all since the issues are huge.Championship mode would run in 8fps for me - regardless of graphic settingsMultiplayer wouldn't find a game (on fibreoptic broadband). The one time it did, it ran at 8fps - regardless of graphic settingsTime Trials worked like a dream, 60fps on the highest settings and more importantly I enjoyed the racing.I should imagine that when codies have pulled their fingers out the game will be great and I'll probably repurchase itbut until they 've done the work, no chance.In conclusion- the game will be fun when it finally works. The cars have a nice feel and the graphics are nice.There are a lot of people talking about blurriness in the graphics, I believe its called chromatic arbetration.There wasn't anywhere to custom search a multiplayer race- in other words I couldnt search Monaco/fullrace/fullweekend/no assists etc. The search options are pre-determined which isnt good.Since I didnt play a huge amount of the game this review is more about the dissatisfaction that I wasn't told it didnt work and spent £35.99 on a game.Don't these developers have morals anymore? Thanks for the refund steam and thanks for making me aware that I now have a second job being a games tester. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

YouTube™ Video: F1 2015  PC Game Review  - GamerMuscle Reviews 

			Views: 17,580		

			F1 2015 for the PC XBoxOne and PS4 is the latest Formula one offering by CodeMasters. Having heard good things about this game during its development we thought we would throw some cash at our PC...		

- Should I buy F1 2015 ?On PC as of right now no probably not - How good are the graphics in F12015 and how well does it run ?Many people on PC are having issues getting stable performance from the game, though code masters recent patches have improved things a bit. For us we have gotten moderately good performance from the game with it looking reasonably nice. Games like project cars look far nicer though especially in-terms of dynamic weather and other PC racers like AC iRacing and GSC could run on a calculator whilst still looking crisp though lacking in as many track side details as F1 2015. - What is the best thing about F1 2015  ?Nice car track and human models that make you feel like you are at an F1 race- What is the Worse thing about F1 2015 ?The game crashes far to often , mostly when doing championship mode or when closing the game, moving from multiplayer back to the menus also sometimes causing the game to hang forcing you to close the game. - What are the are the cars like to drive in F1 2015 ?They feel more progressive than the older F1 games, and far more forgiving, but at the same time they seem quite sloppy to pull out of slides. Fans of driving games like Assetto corsa ,GSC,RF2 or iRacing would probably describe the cars in F12015 as being boat-like. - What are the AI like in F1 2015 ?The AI are not the worse relative to other driving games, but they are certainly not the best. Sometimes you can have good racing with them , other times they will make strange moves or brake on corners where you would not expect it. I think if you were playing as a casual player the AI fine but if you were investing serious time into it then the AI will make you want to pull your teeth out. - Is Codemasters F1 2015 fun ?If it didn't crash and you can look past the lack of content as well as the UI and all the other issues then I can still see many people having fun with this though probably more so on the console than on the PC and more so with a game pad.

												Blatant false advertising (alleged ""new engine"" is still really ego engine) and cut back on features are just some examples of why this game is a huge disappointment.technical:-bloom that cannot be disabled-blur tied to AA means either live with blurry graphics or have extreme aliasing-very poor perfomance even with recommended hardwaresingleplayer:-career removed-no effort put into championship mode whatsoever, literally just spawns you on track-legend AI can be outraced without any real effort-no time attack scenarios, no classic content, no coop mode, no splitscreenmultiplayer:-get kicked all the time for no apparent reason-preset modes instead of free choice of lobbys-horrible matchmaking system-extremeley buggy (wrong results and times appear at the end of a session)-players cars get replaced with AI controlled cars randomly-wrong results shown in end screen-out of sync gameplay (finish first, in reality be 5th)Conclusion: Codemasters has tried a step forward by introducing an update to their ego engine, but has made a step back with literally any feature there is in the game, besides cutting tons of features from previous installments. False advertsing claiming ""new features"" which really aren't new at all make this not only a bad game, but a mocking of any honest paying customer.Do not buy.			",63,1,10,2,3,0,4

												Game is straight broken. I remember when codemasters used to release a game, and I got excited. Well it seems like those days are long gone. Game is buggy, crashes, multiplayer is broken, and honestly does not look ""next gen"" as they keep saying. Multiplayer goes something like this. 1. attempt to connect to friend. Get disconnected 2. try again. get disconnected. 3. Try 4 more times. 4. get into game, and start qualifying. 5. watch the ai take control through the pits, and  bomb you into the wall in turn one. 5. drive around until you can pit. 6. pit, and start to race. 7. finish the race in first on your screen, but end up in 3rd on the podium because the game does not sync correctly in multiplayer. 8. Go to steam and request a refund. 9. write a review, and hope that this game gets removed from steam. Honestly the game is not even ready for early access. codemasters should be ashamed of themselves.			",224,24,33,18,30,1,18

												As a big fan of F1 I am very disappointed with this effort. Wheel supportFirstly, my G27 had no FFB out of the box. I was able to get some FFB by turning it up in the profiler but it feels completely wrong. It's more like a dull resistance than feedback. Secondly unlike every other racing game this game does not automatically set the correct turning angle which means a lot of messing about in the profiler again to get the in game wheel to match up with my real wheel.GraphicsFor a game with such high recommended specs (which my PC meets) the graphics are poor. Nowhere near the level of Project Cars or Assetto Corsa. If a game is recommending a GTX970 it better look amazing. What are they doing with all that processing power? The only conclusion is that this game is very badly optimised. As many people have noted there is a strange blurred look to the graphics too.SummaryLooks like another cash-grab from CM. They have a track record of releasing broken games but I really thought the step into next gen (not that I would call this game next gen) would be different. I have requested a refund for the first time ever on Steam. Usually, I would hold out for a patch but again CM have a track record of never really fixing anything in their patches so I don't anticipate that these issues will be solved. Prove me wrong CM and i'll re-buy the game, I really want to be proved wrong.			",23,0,11,2,9,0,2

												Having played F1 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013, F1 2015 was a huge disappointment. First off, there is no career mode. Yes, you read that right; NO CAREER MODE! The closest option to it sees you driving the season as one of the current drivers on the grid. Graphics do not appear to have changed much if at all since F1 2013. It looks pretty decent, but there is a strange hazy look over everything and some textures are still quite blurry, particularly the steering wheel. Then you have the most important aspect - the driving/handling. After all the previews I read, I expected the handling and feedback to feel really good, but the reality is shockingly bad. With feedback settings turned all the way up, there is hardly anything there. It is by far the most arcade-like driving feel of the Codemasters F1 games to date. The race optoins seem to be dumbed down as well. It seems you are even limited to 25%, 50%, or 100% race distances, nothing in-between. Then there are issues with controls. After customizing my Logitech MOMO Racing wheel in the settings menu, it worked well enough the first time. After quitting out of the game and relauching, it no longer detects my wheel at all. I even tried removing all game settings files and uninstalling/reinstalling the entire game to no avail.This game is a broken shell of its former self that is lacking in nearly every way. It has been stripped of the best game mode. The menu options have been dumbed down even more than they were in F1 2013. I was really looking forward to the revamped, latest iteration of what has been one of my favorite racing series. I have never been so disappointed in a game.			",20,6,6,9,3,0,2

												Absolutely shocking game. Awful. Get a PS2 and play F1 2006 or get F1 2010. No ""immersive"" experience, Pro Season Mode is terrible. No career mode, although that has been sub standard to say the least before. I hope Codemasters lose the rights to this as this was a joke. Maybe charge €15 euro next year as a starting price and maybe people will buy it.They don't even deserve detailed feedback anymore as it's a joke of a game. Get rFactor and use the mods instead.

												It's bugged, it lacks depth, and it's no improvement over its predecessors. In fact, without a career mode, you could argue it's a step back. How can DIRT be so good, even in early access, and yet F1 2015 be so bad in its supposedly 'finished' state? Just a terribly lacklustre effort. Does anyone on the Codemasters team have even the slightest interest in F1? Does Codemasters actually want to make a good F1 game, or are they happy churning out the same steaming pile every year? There are some really good sims out there on the market that thoroughly put this game to shame.			",13,7,10,1,2,0,3

												Right... I was determined not to let the reviews of others sway my opinion when buying the game but I'm afraid many of my complaints are widely shared by others in the community.Previously I had played F1 2010 & F1 2011 and had really enjoyed the game despite not having a full race wheel setup instead I was using an accellerometer based wheel (Simraceway SRW-S1) so when I bought myself a Logitech G29 I was eager to race in this pc series. Unfortunately F1 2011 did not work properly on Windows 10 so I bought F1 2015 on sale and was considerably unimpressed.The first thing I noticed was the graphics were not all they were hyped up to be. The next and IMO the most important thing I noticed was the FFB. Coming from Hundreds of Hours of Project Cars, I was crushingly dissapointed by the FFB. After tinkering with the settings to try and find the optimum setting for my wheel I soon realised it was the way the game sent the FFB signals that was the problem. Basically all you can feel is oversteer and bumps; both are very crude and imprecise and the result is a car that feels like it is floating along and easy to steer through High G turns and feels like a tank when going over bumps. Getting the FFB right like when you find the sweet spot in pCars can allow you to feel your way through a track but unfortunately the game will leave you numb to any sligt movement in the car. I know people have been praising the physics; and whilst I have not tried out the previous games I feel like the physics were another thing that was over-hyped. The breaking doesn't respond with enough sensitivity and despite being a bad driver in 12 hours I have not spun out on a kerb or the white line where as in F1 2011 it was a regular occurence. In terms of the UI I have no complaints and because of the FFB being so crippling I don't really think the game has the playability to warrant any complaints from me about the lack of game modes and the like so I won't touch on it. Even on sale I feel let down and havin gplayed some of the Grid games as well I feel that Codies have definitely lowered their standards and have cemented themselves as the lazy, greedy company that will spit out an unfinished game quickly which get progressively worse as time passes.

												One word. Bad.I don't have the performance issues some have been having, that said on two GTX980's I expected more than 80fps (I am trying to play at 144, excuse my first world problem) for a game engine that looks exactly the same as each previous installment (with a layer of vaseline over the top). I also challenge the claim they've overhauled the physics engine, it doesn't feel any different than even F1 2012. I had high hopes for the handling model given how well they're doing with Dirt Rally. Boy was my hope misplaced.However there are a couple of glaring issues besides the general ""meh"" ness of the above. The quality of the tracks has decreased dramatically. They just feel subpar, like they spent all their budget on marketing and FOM licenses instead of getting a team out to the tracks to actually make them accurate. As an example the first bend at Suzuka is flat. FLAT. I'm all for non-laser scanned tracks, but only as long as they actually put in some effort.The other is the utter madness that is controller support. The wheel works fine, at least as far as it recognises basic inputs, but the game will not under any circumstance recognise my Fanatec Clubsport pedals connected to my GT2 wheel or to the PC via usb. Absolute garbage. I mean this is real basic race sim stuff right here, and they got it right for ALL their games in the last 3-4 years, and now somehow they stuff it up? I mean really?Refund and avoid.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been driving with a Thrustmaster T300RS to test this game and here are my experiences so far:- Graphics:Graphics are just an update. Nothing to great to mention IMHO. It's still way off other titles regarding racing simulations.- Gameplay:No coop, no career. Menu got better.- Sound:Nothing worth mentioning either. Cars sound okay, good thing is that you can hear tyre squeal.- PhysicsThe car behaves good in general. Reactions are fast and accurate, BUT why, Codemasters, can't you ever manage a decent Force Feedback?! I mean seriously, they've been working on F1 titles for the last 6 years and I have never been pleased with the FFB (only skipped F1 2014 so far)! It's weak and simply not accurate at all. Take racing simulations from other devs as an example and start getting to work, it's simply embarrassing!Wheelspin is pretty aggressive, which is good, but I can't really control it, which is caused by my bad pedals, too, I'm afraid. But you can compromise a little with setup and wheel settings.- Setup:I could never trust Codemasters' setups in F1 titles and the same goers for F1 2015. The settings just don't influence the handling in the way they should. You simply can't create an individual setup for your personal driving style, which has been a problem since the series started in 2010.In addition to that, you can't change the braking balance in the setup and the description of weigth distribution says, that if you change it to the front you assist understeer. Codemasters, that is simply NOT TRUE, since it supports OVERSTEER if there is less weigth on the rear! This is almost as ludicrous as the settings for rear anti-roll bars in your past titles, where stiffening them caused better traction!- AI:AI got pretty aggressive, which is good. But the bad thing is that it got pretty ""derby"". It's alright if AI drivers do mistakes, but I won't accept an AI which spins me off track while driving straight, especially if I voluntarily let the drivers past.- Car damage:Touching the wall ""not-so-gently"" while driving straight with 250+ km/h and having neither front wing damage nor suspension damage...Need I say more? Here you go: Touching the rear of an AI-Car while breaking, no damage to my car. Ridiculous.- Bugs:Breaks are broken, according to status screen, as soon as I exit the pits.Tyres get cold immediately after releasing the throttle. That's way too fast!Again just ONE training session. But, according to rumours, BEFORE the day one patch there have been three...Seems that codemasters cancelled them afterwards.Crashes when performing an ingame Benchmark-test and when exiting the game.Sorry, Codies, but you won't get any more money from me. I have better things to spend that 50 bucks on, seriously....			",53,17,3,13,6,0,8

												+ Great graphics+ Super fun and Challenging to drive the cars+ AI has improved a lot, but there is still some things negative about them (which I will point out on the negativ points)+ Runs very smooth with my i5 and GTX 970 with minimum 60 fps every time- No Safety Car / No Formation Lap and Career Mode- Podium is the same every time, and winning the Championship is only slightly different- Tyrewear seems to be non existing for the AI - AI can't handle cold tyres at all, which results in overtaking them easily after a pitstop- AI likes to ignore Blue Flags - When an AI tries to lap others in Monaco for example they are just stuck behind them for several rounds- AI being stuck in the pit and both cars from a team pitting on the same lap making the 2nd car lose time, because he have to wait- The 2nd gear glitch, which destroys your engine- The damagemodel didn't change at all and compared to reality this is just not real at allOverall there are much more negative points than positive ones, but I'm a fan of the F1 series and it just looks way better than 2014. I'm a type of person, who did only play Career Mode, but I prefer better graphics over the same graphics the last 4 years and having the current lineup of drivers. What really wonders me is the removal of the Career Mode, because they can't deliver it on a good level. Well... I drove with my name on F1 2013 and the Overall on my Lotus had the name of Grosjean and a French flag.So why do you remove a mode, which did not had improvements since 2011 and didn't change any visual things either.Just gonna hope for a real improvement in modes for F1 2016.

												Note:This review is based on playing with a Ferrari F1 Wheel Integral T500Controls with a controller are pretty mediocre, so if that's your thing, I recommend 2013.Pros:Greatly improved handling - it just feels a lot more fluent and fun to driveImproved FFB - rain races are a lot better now compared to 2014AMAZING tire model - Tire management really is a thing now, you'll get rewarded for looking after your tires (harder for controller users, benefiting wheel users)Improved time trial - Leaderboads now offer you to copy someones setup, so you can really see who's betterContent - Might not seem like a big deal, but you got 2015 and 2014 seasons availableImproved AI behaviour - AI is more aggressive, they don't back out like in the old games and can actually overtake you nowCons:No career mode - No big deal for me, but a huge letdown for some peopleNo Safety Car - Kinda sucks, but better for multiplayer actually, since people liked to abuse itMultiplayer - Public lobbies with lots of issues, private lobbies via invites mostly working fineWeather forecast - No forecast for the whole weekend, only the present dayDamage model - Though the engine was improved, the damage model is more or less the same as before, which is disappointingAI difficulty - A bit too low for me, balance between cars isn't good (Mercedes AI extremely overpowered, rest is really slow)Conclusion:The game surely isn't perfect and needs quite some work, but aside from the bugs, which can be really annoying sometimes, this is definitely the best codemasters game yet. Make sure to pick it up on a sale though.Overall, I've had more fun than frustration playing this game so far, so I'm gonna recommend it!If you aren't sure, I suggest waiting some more time before buying it.

												Updated Review 28th of May 2016:Is this a good game? NOShould you buy it? Only if you like being angry, frustrated and hate fun.Is there anything good? Well the graphic is okay. And if F1 is your thing, ""happy days"".So what is the issues with the game?Well there are many.1) No single player campaign, you only play a season as a one of the current drivers2) The multiplayer has many missing features  A) No safety car  B) No Full Qualifying (But is part of single player, so why not Multiplayer?)  C) You can't rejoin a session  D) You can't restart a race without, redoing everything again.  E) Coming out of the PIT, the game will control your car - great. Whats not great is it doesn't inform you when you get control. Often just as you hit the first corner, making it a♥♥♥♥♥♥show.   F) Odd lags, that happens add random. Played a match with a friend, first race he had ton of lag - restarted the race and suddenly it was me getting. Where it freezes your car, so everybody else passes you.etc.3) Penalty system that is, to me, so faulty its game breaking.  A) Getting penalty - without prior warnings.   B) Getting penalties for AI ramming you from behind. Which happen often  C) Getting warnings for corner cutting while driving on a straight line   D) Inconsistency: 2 Corner cutting warnings on 15 laps = 5secs penalty. Friend gets 9-10 warnings on 8 laps = 3 secs penaltyetc.AND THE BIG ONE!4) AI, stupid god damn horrifying turd of an AI. The majority of the time they have no clue where you are or that you exist. They will ram you for no reason, even when they have ton of space to pass. Monaco is a prime example of this and the penalty system that is so unjust that its on a ""delete this♥♥♥♥♥♥now!"" kind of level.The AI is the main reason why I hate this game, why I recommend no one buy this game. The AI is the soul reason why F1 2015 is one of the worst racing games I have played. It destroys every single drop of fun this game has to offer. When racing large tracks it becomes a bit lets - but a track like Monaco becomes unplayable for me.In short: The AI feels like its take from a Destruction Derby game.So no I don't like this game, I don't recommend it, I don't want anybody to be filled with so much rage as me from playing against Codemasters excuse of an AI. Original Rage review:I hate this game, so much. The AI is ♥♥♥♥ poor and takes all the fun out of it.Most of the time they have no situational awareness and they often drive more like destruction derby than F1. So no matter if I have good race, AI will usually find a way to ram me off the track.And the penalty system is odd, giving me corner cutting warning while driving straight or penalties when its the AI that rams you.

												So far so crap.Within the time constraints of Steams refund system I had to try to get this game working well and within 50 minutes I gave up, and here's why.It ran at the v sync level of 60 fps with frame rate drops that made it not fun to play. Even a few fps is enough to ruin the experience. Turn the settings down I hear you say. The problem is the frame rate drops occurred whether I was running in 3440 x 1440 Ultrawide or 1080p. Exactly the same drops at the same points of the track and even when I set everything to low. It does not hold a steady 60fps in the game. The benchmark works fine, it's even the same track. I get average 88fps on the ultrawide format with everything maxed, but not in game.My sytem specs ATM are as follows :- 2 x GeForce GTX Titan X 12GB cards- CPU: Intel Core i7 4790K Overclocked to 4.8GHz - Motherboard: Asus Maximus VII Formula Z97X- RAM: Avexis Blitz 16GB 2400MHz C10- Samsung 840 Evo 1TB SSD- Seagate Barracuda 2TB SATA-III Hard Drive- LG 16x Blu Ray writer- OS: Microsoft Windows 8.1 64-Bit- Super Flower Leadex Platinum 1200W Power Supply- Dell Ultrasharp 21:9 Curved monitor- Fully water cooled inside and out :-)I've ran the game with and without SLi on and I get the exact same fps and with the drops too. It's clearly not right.Track-IR does not work which would be something sorely missed after enjoying that in previous F1 titles.Backgrounds pass by like they are being shown on a flip book, there's a certain amount of stutter, flashing that's hard to describe, it's more of a feeling than something you can see if you get my drift. It just doesn't feel smooth even when it is running at 60fps, again that's with and without SLi on.EDIT : Well the FPS drops have gone now, for some odd reason the game has started to run smoothly in that sense. But the backgrounds still pass by like they are on a flick book, especially Albert Park. It's the trees that seem to have a weird shadow issue that makes the game look jerky. I decided to keep the game and hope that things get sorted out because the basics are there to suggest a good game will be possible eventually.			",174,31,21,12,28,3,5

												Having purchased all the previous Codemasters F1 games and played them competively in online leagues, I actually approached this one with some quiet optimism for once, naively thinking that CM would pull out all the stops for this ""next gen"" title. Unfortunately, my hopes have been dashed for the 2nd year in a row. F1 2014 was a complete disaster and now F1 2015 ranks up there amongst the worst. (Not that F1 2010/11/12/13 were without glitches)Firstly, the positives: 2014 season is included. This is good, CM have included the full '14 season with all the teams and tracks. It's a nice addition that does add some depth to the game. The new handling model is less forgiving than F1 2014 and certainly better than F1 2013. (Using a wheel at least) I can't speak about the FFB because my wheel doesn't have any, but the handling is exciting, the car slides out from under you under braking and it is difficult to accelerate out of low speed corners. On the other hand, there is a real sense of grip at high speed corners.  The car models themselves look very good, with all the steering wheels this time round. Although I haven't tested it fully, the AI seems to be quicker and more aggressive offline.Unfortunately, these improvements are offset by a myriad of problems. Here are the negatives: Graphics are overall quite poor, aside from the cars, everything is permeated by a strange blur. CM's awful filter returns Wheel support is poor. I have had a lot of problems with keys randomly rebinding - to such an extent that I have to use my keyboard to navigate the menus Voice command support is confusing - I'm still not sure if I am able to use it. Online is broken. Ghost cars are back - proper, competitive online racing is impossible at the moment because people's cars do not synchronise properly. I might be racing through Becketts, but on someone elses screen I'll be 20 seconds further back. AI is slower online it seems. Glitches when exiting the pits, the car will randomly shift into 2nd gear even with pit assist off. Corner cutting is AGAIN an issue. It's so lenient that anyone could shave seconds off their lap times by cutting corners without gettting penalised. This really is disgraceful considering it is CM's 6th attempt at an F1 game. No co-op or career mode. Also no custom helmets online. Audio is boring and flat too. There's other glitches too, but there are too many for me to remember off the top of my head.Overall, this is a truly dismal effort by CM. After so many years Codemasters are still failing at the basics which is truly awful for a company that has spent years churning out F1 games. Something must be fundamentally wrong in the development process for this game to have got cleared through quality control. A very basic testing of online functionality would have revealed that this game was not fit for release.If you just want a very casual playthrough with the latest cars and circuits then this is the game for you. If you want a more in depth experience then steer clear of this wreckage.If this CM was an F1 driver it would be Pastor Maldonado: Somehow still involved with the sport despite constantly disappointing us all time and time again.

												(Update: a workaround for the controller issue exists - plug in the controller after launching the game. Then the default mapping works as intended, and you can enjoy the much-improved handling. Given the number of other issues that people are experiencing I'd still hold fast for a while if you're not willing to risk it, but the game itself is really enjoyable when it all works fine) Well, the launch of F1 2015 has been somewhat disasterous. Every platform has had major bugs, none more than PC. Issues with controls, instability, FPS drops, derpy AI... Thankfully, a couple of patches have already released, which fixed some of the crashes and problems with gamepads. The gamepad issue is game-breaking for me - the default controller mapping leaves the brakes locked on, and remapping them leaves no deadzone, making the car difficult to control.The game shows a lot of promise - the AI are far more aggressive than earlier games, and the graphics are pretty. Unfortunately in its current state it's nigh on impossible to play, and I cannot recommend it until Codemasters fixes the major issues.			",85,13,10,8,6,2,7

												Recently I played few great racing games. Dirt Rally, Project CARS, Assetto Corsa... if you're waiting for me to mention F1 2015... well, it's not going to happen. Gameplay in F1 is decent, it's a good balance of simulation and casual racing and I loved the game when I was testing it by driving some time trials on good old tracks. However, when I started my first season, won my first pole and started a race, game kicked me in a head, then hit me one more time when I was on the floor. AI is absolutely terrible! It's like I'm playing Carmaggedon. I played not more than 5 single player races and 5 times ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI spined me like police when chasing the bad guys or just hit me from behind. When I'm overtaking AI, they are like my ex-girlfrend - they just can't let go. Okay, I still got multiplayer and this should be a lot of fun. Oh, wait, there are 3 sessions online! One for begginers where guy just stays at the starting grid every race, one decent but overcrowded and one with experienced drivers where I look like carting driver vs Sebastian Vettel.

Game likes to crash, it has a memory leak (95% RAM usage even when I have left the game), grapchis are far to much demandig for what the game shows, sounds are so quiete that I have to add 50% more volume to an usual state. There is no SAFETY CAR?!?! What were you thinking Codemasters? I would really like to know what's on your mind by remocvng the most important thing it the F1 game????????The very good thing is that handling has improved a lot compared to F1 2014.Do I recommend this game? Honestly said more NO than YES but will wait and see what will they do with the game. I am not even surprised they have released another buggy, half-done game with the lack of content and features.

AVOID! Codies Worst F1 Game EVER!So, I've been a long time fan of Codies F1 series. I've owned F1 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, so of course, it was a no brainer I would get F1 2015. Now, F1 2015, I can say without any doubt that it is the worst F1 game Codies has ever made. I haven't experienced the optimization issues some have, I'm running it at 1080p, every setting maxed and getting around 110-120 FPS (SLI 980's.) The game does look better than previous years, but is worse in just about every other way it can be.With this game, Codies have removed the career mode. This was already known before release, but is still a huge disappointment, as the championship mode to replace it is extremely lacking. The physics and damage are absolutely abyssmal. It drives worse than any other F1 game I've ever played. I noticed how bad the damage was (This is with it on full, too.) so I drove into a wall at full speed in Australia. My front wing broke off, and the rest of the car was fine. Absolutely ridiculous. The cars handle like boats and are terrible to drive. I use a Thrustmaster T500RS wheel. In all previous games, I've set force feedback to around 50% and it has been perfect,  I could get a good amount of feedback through the wheel and it felt very realistic. Now, with the new game, I have everything in 100% and I can barely feel anything. There's a slight vibration and nothing more with everything maxed out. The car drives like a donkey and when force feedback is essentially non-existant, welp, it becomes almost impossible to drive.Now, let's get into the fun (not really) that is online. Online is completely broken right now. I joined a lobby for a standard sprint race earlier. 5 of us in the lobbies, no races yet. Apparently I had already got 25 points whilst everyone else was at 0 (As I should have been, since there were no races completed yet.) Then I got into the race. Every car that was around me disappeared upon race start. I thought I was alone on the track, nobody showed on the track or the map, and I appeared to be all alone. Then at the end of lap 2, the fastest lap time shows, and it's the driver who started behind me. Yep. I finish the race and apparently on this empty track the other guy finished ahead of me by just over 1 second and won the race, giving me 2nd and 18 points, however, since I already started with 25 points out of nowhere, I was winning the championship by 18 points still. Oh, and I forgot to mention, from start to end of that race, my car was semi-transparent and flickering constantly, which was annoying and very distracting.F1 has had some releases that weren't that great (Looking at you, 2014), but none that weren't enjoyable (even if it did take mods to make them as fun as they should be.), every game so far I've found to be worth what I paid for it. Every game except for this one. As a long time F1 fan and fan of racing games, I hate to have to say that this is the last time I ever buy an F1 game so long as Codemasters owns the licence for F1 games. They have completely butchered it in every way imaginable and more. Codemasters, I doubt you'll read this, but I hope you do, just so you know how much you've destroyed what was my favourite racing game series.I do not reccomend this game to anyone, and I advise you not to buy it, as you will be far better off playing literally any earlier F1 game.

												For ♥♥♥♥'s sake Codemasters I knew there was a high posibility of not delivering much inovation to the series, but you seriously gave the gamers a ♥♥♥♥ing downgraded game! I mean how more could you ♥♥♥♥ this up? I think I can't be more dissapointed since my expectations are so low. How on earth can you give your customers a product such as F1 2015? And I am not even mentioning the bugs that come with the game (which luckily did not occure in my game)!Since I started with a negatively very bad introduction I'll try to talk about the pros. First of all the number one thing I was desprately waiting for was the inprovment of the AI cars. This year i could finally say the AI cars are a challenge and gives the game a tromendous amount of depth which makes the races attractive in so many levels compared to the previous F1 games from Codies, but it took them 5 years to improve such a basic gameplay tool that should be a priority in every racing game! And ladies and gentlemen that's about it when it comes to gameplay improvment.There is also an improvment in the graphics and it's nice to see a visual difference between F1 2015 and previous F1 games. I could insist it looks next gen, but it isn't mind blowing. Now the cons: It seemed to me that the developers were mostly interested in the graphic upgrade such as better looking environments, drivers faces and the engineers ,which is completely pointless since all of the character models are acting the same just like in other pre-race start. It definitely does not make my Formula 1 experience more authentic regardlessly on how much the graphics are in depth of detail. If I get to see the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over again it just gets annoying (same thing about the Crofty's commentary). I'd rather just have a simple menu were I could use my imagination instead of forcing my self to enjoy something I'm used to see a lot of amount of times. Some drivers do look pretty neat and some do look literally disgusting like for example Maldonado's face is so ugly that I feel sorry for the driver.The worst thing about this game is the missing content. At first I was amazed by racing for the first couple of laps, but after trying to play a different single player mode instead of just playing quick race, champions mode or time trail I started to realize there is nothing really else to do in this game, but wait you say there is multiplayer? Well i say multiplayer is pure ♥♥♥♥. I spent a week playing this game and I could not even once find a multiplayer session. Codemasters won't let you even create an open lobby session, You can only play with your freinds, but if you wanna race with the rest of the world you can use their ""innovative"" multiplayer modes which don't have a single player in it!And the last thing I would like to mention is one of the important aspect of the game that has a big part on how the game runs is the LACK OF SAFETY CAR. I have simply no words for not including such an important game feature that was in the previous games. You say it will be patched sooner or later? That makes it look like that the game is still in early access alpha god damn it!When it comes to gameplay features this game is definetly fun, but this innovative feature of the game cannot save it from the overall lack of content. In the end this is just an average game and there is nothing really special about it. I'd give this game 3/5  if the multiplayer would work well  and if they wouldn't take out some of the important gameplay features such as a red flag or the safety car.FINAL VERDICT: 2/5Oh and I spent about 50 hours playing this game on my other steam account.

												Pro's: - Graphics; it gets more realistic every year and 2015 is no exception- Stable game - I heard people had problems with error 41's or crashes to desktop: haven't had any.- Realistic driving, pro season got me 4 laps behind - then again I suck without ABS so it should be this way. AI is fun to drive against (although too aggresive at times)Con's:- Bugs. A lot of them. I feel like being a beta tester, but then I'm not paid or am aware of the game being in beta state. Surely every game has its glitches post-release, but there's a difference between nuisances or game breakers. Gamebreakers are being patched alright, but they shouldn't have existed in such amounts. One or two can happen, five is way too much- Online still hasn't been fixed, 3 weeks after release. One should think racing games such as these have a large multiplayer community...Can't find lobbies, especially the hardcore hopper. And whose idea was it to remove the custom lobbies?- Omitting the career and coop mode. Does this have something to do with the ever-present profile corruption bug? Instead of fixing it, removing it?. Coop was a lot of fun, even with total strangers. It's hidden in the online mode (manually lobby with a friend, then pick the races), but the option has gone from the menu.- Did I mention a lot of bugs?F1 2013, my previous, was a lot better than this game; the only positive I can find is that the cars are handling better, Codemasters should make F1 2016 (2017?) a better game, if not I suspect the Codemasters series will lose its fanbase, and rightly so. I hope they'll be like Williams (2013-2014): after a suckass game, make a great one. ",56,17,12,20,8,0,4

												Basically the game doesn't work with my Driving Force GT. Wheel weight is featherlight and basically unuseable with zero FFB no matter what settings I try. Others also seem to have the same problem though no solution has been found yet. Of course it will likely be for the community to fix this and I have no faith in Codemaster's (what a joke of a copany name) post release support.Currently unplayable (for me) 0/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Damn I wanted to like this so much. As an avid follower of F1 and a racing game enthusiast, I had some hopes in the new physics and their work in FFB... But it shouldn't be.After playint time trial in a Ferrari F15-T on Silverstone using a Logitech G27, I can say the following:-FFB feels atrocious. No info. No feeling of load on any axle. No feel for grip loss. It vibrates when you are off-track though.-Codemasters seem to have trouble mastering steering wheels. Even selecting the correct preset, the rotation of the ingame-wheel and the real wheel are not locked. You can fix this by limiting the range of your wheel, but it just gives me a bad first impression. Other games do this so much better, for example project CARS or assetto corsa.-The physics are hard to judge with that force feedback. But good luck trying not to lock up when you can't feel a thing. It's a guessing game. The only indicator for lockups is a high-pitched, very loud tyre squeal.+/-The graphics are ok. The screen on the wheel is generic, gives very little info, the textures of the driver gloves are muddy and generally it just doesn't scream ""beautiful"". But the graphics are good enough+The sound of the engine sounds goodAfter only 11 minutes of playing, the game doesn't fascinate me enough to continue playing. I am debating whether to get a refund.I do NOT recommend this game to wheel users at all			",46,3,10,3,12,0,3

Posted: July 12, 2015
												F1 Race Stars is a better Formula 1 game than this......I have been a fan of Codmasters F1 and Dirt series games since the first release. I preordered this game with the information that I read over the internet from reviewers and from the Codies website. I also used my previous experience with Codmasters F1 games as a basis on what type of quality to expect from a game like this one. I have previously purchased Dirt, Dirt 2, Dirt 3, F1 2010 thru 2014 from Steam and for the most part was happy with my purchase. I am also a fan of other racing titles that are more sim than game such as IRacing, Project cars. I have enjoyed playing Race 07, Asetto Corsa except the game server on Asetto Coursa is a joke. I spent many hours in Papyrus titles like GPL and their Nascar series , and also on Geoff Crammonds World Circuit thru his GP4. I have seen both the good and bad of all these titles at their best and worst. I did not set my expectations for F1 2015 any higher than what I had seen them previously release.Common sense would dictate that a company that has been making F1 games for the PC since their September release in 2010 would have a good handle on what it takes to get a game ready to market. Common sense need not apply here. It seems with the release of F1 2015 Codmasters has indeed returned to it's roots......console gaming. This title was written with that customer in mind, once again letting the PC customer know their business was unimportant to Codemasters.The control menus are a bad joke with the PC customer being the punchline. I was never able to get both my CSW V2 wheel and Richmotech real race gear pedals to work at the same time. It is a game that really does not have a target audience and does not know where to fit in. It is neither a Sim for hardcore enthuiasts or an arcade game strictly for fun. It lacks the features needed to entice the player into the simulated world of F1 Racing. This game is like a bad coat of paint aimed squarely at oblivion and doesn't really cover up all the problems underneath. With a shameful lack of content considering what was in previous releases, there is No fuunctional safety car, No  TV interviews, No career mode, No co-op mode, No Classic F1 cars,  No season challenge, No rival system, No champions mode, No SLI support, No split screen, No motorhome. No paddock and No TV interviews. The sheer scarcity of options and modes means this is yet another year where the ""Official F1 tie-in"" never even gets to the starting grid. The amount of modes left out of this title is borderline criminal and scandalous. It feels like less than half a game was released at a premium price no less. This title is far inferior to 2014, which was in turn inferior to the 2013 release. I don't believe most buyers will believe this is a ""less is more"" situation, but rather a trend to charge more and give less. They ""throw in"" the 2014 season as a bonus, because it's obvious they intend to BONE US with this title and the absense of so much of what should be seen as standard for F1. Codemasters really should kiss you before you buy this game, since it seems their intent is to just screw you, perhaps you would feel less used after. This publisher is so hell bent on hitting it's yearly release schedule that it pulled this one out of the oven half baked, and a easy bake oven they got a at a garage sale at that.I run a high end system and love to see titles push that hardware for what its worth. My current rig features  a core !7-5960, 64 gb ddr4, (2) Titan X video cards in SLI, 2 ASUS G-sync 27"" monitors at a res of  5890 x 1080 bezel corrected @144 hz. Aparently I would have had better results on a console system with this title. It crashed the first few times I ran a benchmark test so bad I needed to reload my video drivers and recalibrate the monitors as this game had them stuck in limbo after multiple crashes. This game crashes more than Maldonado and Grosjean combined. The graphics looked bad even when I got them to display, but they were constantly blinking and flashing, seemingly fishing for a proper state of display this catastrophy of a game could not deliver. It looked like it was snowing in Singapore and it nearly caused me to have suffer a seizure from the constant screen blinking. Because I never was ablle to get my wheel and pedals working at the same time, even though they worked fine in all their previous titles, I can not comment on the physics. The track textures have a filtery feeling that left me nausiated as well. This game is so awkwardly stylized it's more like a bad cartoon Anime, than a racing title.I would have to say that after a few hours of utter frustration spent trying to fix all the problems that run rampant with simple setup of this game, that the quit menu works great and that's about all. But even that suffers from problems as Steam then tries desperately to download some sort of non-existent update and finishes on an error 41. I suggest we all quit buying these type of half baked mess and let Codemasters know it no excuses as it is not their first rodeo, but could be their last. The best thing to do with this game is delete it permantly from your drive. There are plenty of good titles that offer proper racing that works to deal with this junk. Return it and get a refund while you can. Don't let them pull the wool over your eyes with idle promises to fix it....baaaahhhh bahhhhh.In a side note to STEAM, shame on you too. I have been a customer for over 8 years and have never even tried to return a title. I tried multiple times to get a refund on this as I was never able to complete even one lap, but was told that beacause I had more than 2 hours of trying to fix this worthless piece of junk, that they would not refund my money. Instead opting to join their co-conspirator Codmasters in ripping of a loyal customer for short term profit. Shame on you STEAM and Codmasters, I have purchased many of your products and recommended them to my friends, alas my policy is changed on that too. I will NEVER pre purchase a title again with this return policy. I had always believed that STEAM treated their customers fairly and with respect, but I see this was yet another lesson learned from this terible gaming experience.Your money would be much better spent on the 2012 or 2013 Codemasters F1 games than this abortion of a game. I would recommend Project Cars or IRacing to anyone looking for a Racing Sim.Had either of those titles offered all the cars or tracks from the current F1 season I would have never bothered with this lackluster castrophy in the first place. Save your money and buy something else.			",29,0,24,0,3,0,1

												I would have loved to score this a 10 as I've been supporting Codemasters series since its first go at F1. But this game does leave me with two main problems. Firstly the use of next gen graphics. Yeah eye candy is the word but at the expense of clarity. This leaves me with so much eye strain because of this constant sense of my eyes being out of focus. I'm left grabbing for a set of glasses I dont have. The use of soft treatment of solid outlines, blurred motion (you cannot turn off) and overall visual sense of lack of visual focus is painful at best. The second issue is that of control. The driving dynamics compared to F1 2014 for me is a step backward. I constantly feel like the car is doing what it pleases in a negative way. You dont get the feeling you are in control most of the time. The lack of setitng deadzones, sensitivity is a loss for me. For now this scores a 5/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: June 19, 2016
												An honest review from a long-time Codies and F1 fan:Let me start by saying I don't play multiplayer often so this review has nothing to do with that section of the game.Having until now held back from purchasing this game due to the lack of career mode and the discussions of game-breaking bugs and crap AI, I can honestly say I was surprised at how not-broken this game really is. - Is it clearly a rushed job in terms of menus and extra content (i.e. challenge modes) from previous titles? Yes. - Is it a shame that there's only a 'championship season' mode rather than career? Yes, hugely!However, this game is NOT broken. Sure, there are some optimisation issues that mean that I can't run it on ultra, whereas my machine specs might otherwise have allowed it. But it looks very pretty on 'high' settings--far better than any F1 game has looked by far. Furthermore, since the modes are kind of bare-bones, the most important aspect of the entire game has to be the car mechanics and the racing. The mechanics themselves, while not perfect, feel really nice. This is NOT an arcade F1 game: with assists off you're fighting your back end out of the corners and trying to manage fuel/tyres in a way never before achieved in an F1 game. There's improvement to be made, but it's heading in a really great direction for F1 2016. For those really into the technical stuff, adjusting brake-bias and other settings are far more important now when it comes to preventing tyre lock-ups that now actually will destroy individual tyres. The AI is pretty dumb at times, admittedly. But it isn't game breaking (perhaps it was fixed over time).  But if you're like me and you were an F1 fan itching for F1 2016, hesitating to buy this one or having completely written it off, with the discount it's a really good buy. It is no longer a broken game as many reviews will tell you and it's actually a lot of fun. It's not the F1 2015 we were all hoping for, without career mode. But they focused on the racing, the feel of the cars, and they've done that really well. To tide you over until 2016 is released in August, I would definitely recommend this. More casual racing fans ought to stay away and wait until 2016 which will undoubtedly be better and more polished.Overall: 7/10 If it had career mode and some AI fixes it'd easily be a 9. As a result, buy it when on sale. ",114,10,19,26,9,0,20

When you instead settle for normal races you'll find that you can't turn collisions on. Turning them on will simply result flickering cars (including your own, annoyingly), while you can still drive trough eachother.Didn't crash on my 970, but simply very thin on features.Handling is improved over other versions, but doesn't compensate for the lack of content/bugs.

												A crying shame of a product.Before I start, let me say I've by no means had the worst of this: the game runs fairly well for me, I've experienced far fewer crashes than some others, and I actually can maintain a just-about-playable 30-35 FPS (though with micro-stuttering).F1 2015 was touted as the start of the 'next series' of F1 games, with improved visuals and handling (both of which are, indeed, present).  However, it's fairly clear to see why there was very little media coverage of the game prior to launch: a huge swathe of features present in the 2010-2014 iterations of the title simply aren't there (no safety car, no brake options in setup, no career mode, etc.) and even some of the promised features don't function yet on PC (voice-activated race engineer, for example).  The omission of career mode doesn't really bother me greatly, though it was a nice feature, but removing the safety car in an F1 season where it's seen a significant amount of action, seems incredibly short-sighted.Add to this a game that crashes frequently; fails to remember options set in menus; has AI who drive like you're not even there (ramming you from behind or aggressively swerving into one of your rear tyres, usually resulting in a penalty for you); and displays a horrendous impermeable ""blur"" past about 200m in front of the car, that makes it almost impossible to see braking points and fine details in the distance... and you have a disappointing product.Many wondered how the system requirements for the game could be so high, in the face of a comparatively stripped-down F1 experience, and we have our answer: graphical optimisation seems almost non-existant.  The difference between ""everything on ultra"" and ""everything on low/off"" on my machine, represents a whopping 5 FPS difference (from ~30 FPS to ~35 FPS)... leaving us to assume there's a serious bottleneck occurring somewhere, that apparently wasn't worth finding before asking customers to hand over their hard-earned £40.Amongst all of this, however, it has to be said: the handling model has improved significantly in most of the major areas, and you do feel significantly less 'helpless' than in previous F1 titles by Codemasters (which infamously included the mind-bogglingly stupid ""auto-spin kerbs"").  I've been enjoying the driving experience, until the blur and micro-stuttering gives me a headache and I have to give it a break for an hour or two :)Not as bad of a screw-up as Arkham Knight, but certainly worthy of being mentioned in the same sentence - a spectacularly poor attempt from Codemasters and, if I hadn't purchased from a third-party, I'd be half way to my Steam refund by now.

												**I havent played previous F1 games so i will not compare this to older games**Pros:-Graphics/Visuals-Sound-Official 2015 tracks/teams-Handling of the Car-Loading times (really fast)-Cutscenes and CommentatorsCons:-Performance(its fine enough, but could be better)-Cannot be ""yourself"" in Championship-AI sometimes too agressiveOverall Great game. As a Linux user i don't have the older games so this one will do it. If you are F1 racing fan then this is a must get game. Hopefully F1 2016 will improve on that and will also come out to Linux.

												After reading all the mostly negative reviews I still decided to give it a try as I wanted to see what the new eye candy would be given I have the Titan Z 12GB card.  Well sure, it's a bit prettier, but only a bit.  Unfortunaetly the good stops there.Fortunately they've fixed the separate USB controller issue so I could use my Thrustmaster TX wheel base and Fanatec Elite pedals.  Setting up the steering feel was nearly impossible.  It's rather difficult in all the Codeworks games but extra bad/hard here.  But the biggest problem by a mile and the reason I requsted a refund is the HORRIBLE sound.  Wow, it's just awful.  You hear nearly no engine and gearbox noise, it's like drivig down the highway where you hear nothing but wind.  I tried the various cameras and some were a touch better than others but only slightly.  I was rather surprised that it wasn't simple setting somwhere but nope, just awful.If you want to drive Formula cars on a PC get with F1 2013 or Project Cars (and run Formula A) stay far away from this mess.  First video game I've returned in my life.			",44,1,6,0,4,0,0

												CAUTION: DUE TO THE STATE OF THIS GAME, THIS REVIEW IS SUBJECT TO CHANGEOkay, so Codemasters have really confused me with this one. Their F1 series, while generally good (2013 being their best effort, at least for me), has always lacked that little bit of magic to truly set it apart from previous, and quite frankly, better F1 games.F1 2015 had the opportunity to really set a new standard for the genre, with Codemasters finally taking the hint and using the power of next generation gaming platforms to build a newer, more modern engine.What followed is a product that has ultimately both satisfied and disappointed me for various reasons. Here we go.PROS- The handling model. Yes. Finally. I can't believe it. Codies have actually managed to produce cars which drive and feel great. And not in the ""easy"" sense of things. Turn the aids off, and you will struggle for traction, you will pump the brakes to keep them from locking, and you will need lightning reactions to correct over/understeer and avoid damaging your car and tyres. The feedback provided through the wheel is great, and you almost instantly know you've taken a corner well, even with your eyes shut. It truly is satisfying when you really nail a corner, let alone a whole lap.- The Presentation. One thing Codies Racing fans have been asking for since 2010 is a more TV-styled game, and this year they finally deliver. The often talked about Broadcast Presentation before and after races is great, with TV style camera angles and OSDs that come close to the FOM world feed. The commentary is awesome too, with lots and lots of varied lines, you don't really hear much of the same thing, and it just gels. It doesn't sound robotic and mis-matched like previous attempts at putting commentary in an F1 game. (I'm looking at YOU, Championship Edition.)And that's about it, I'm afraid. All that I really enjoy about this game. Those two points. I'm serious. Really.Here's a quick mish-mash of all the cons then:CONS- Codemasters giveth, and they doth taketh away. Want to race as yourself? Too bad. It's gone. Want to race with equal setups in Time Attack to truly find who is the best? Shame, that's gone too. Safety Car? Gone. Season Challenge? Gone. Scenario Mode...you get the idea.- The game doesn't seem to save my preferences and I find myself having to redo custom controls every I boot up.- Online Multiplayer. No. Just no.- Then there's the numerous bugs and glitches truly representative of an unfinished game. Just type in F1 2015 glitches/bugs in Youtube and you'll pretty much get what I mean.- Codies' amazing idea to pad out the game with 2014 content and hope no-one notices.It's a shame that, while Codemasters finally got something amazingly right in F1 2015, there are too many places where they just fall flat on their faces. I really don't know if I can review this as Recommended. I guess if the improved handling model is all you ever wanted, then it's great. Have a blast. However, if you were looking forward to a more comprehensive game with more appeal beyond just a World Championship Season, then just stick with F1 2013, it really is still the best.

												An absolute mess of a game.  Weird bugs, incomprehensible force feedback, stupid online matchmaking and sync problems.  CM touts the ""TV Presentation"" of the game, but once you've seen it...you want it to go away.  The podium ceremonies are just the same cutscene each time with different skins.  I initially thought it was clever when Seb did ""the finger"".  When Lewis won the next race and did the exact same thing...my thoughts changed to ""how lame"".  The highly touted ""next-gen"" graphics, just make the game look like a muddled, blocky mess with a huge helping of motion blur (blur can only be turned off by editing an XML file).  I will say in 2015's defense though, they do seem to finally have gotten the AI drivers right, but better AI can't save this title.If you want an exciting drive...get Dirt Rally instead.  If you want a better sim?  Get Race07.BTW, this is the first game I've ever requested a refund on.  Sadly, was denied due to 4.6 hours of trying to find a way to get it to run acceptably (and sitting for 30mins in online lobbies).Until CM fixes this beast, I'm going back to 2013 (IMHO the best of the series).Avoid at all costs.

												I'm on poll at Monaco.  First corner, I feel a huge shunt in the back and I bounce off the barriers.  There's a massive accident behind me involving 16 AI cars.  There's no red flag.  There's no safety car.  There's no damage to my car.  The race continues for the four cars at the front.  A replay of the incident shows AI cars driving head-first into the crashed cars with no attempt to go around.  It's carnage.  I win the race.  I'm disappointed.That sums up F1 2015 for me.  Disappointment.  No patches in the world can fix this game before F1 2016 is released.+ Visuals are good+ AI better at overtaking- No safety car- No red flags- No career mode- No warm up lap- Poor damage model- Qualifying times buggy- Commentary is stale- Blue flagged cars don't move over and still fight for position- Just bugs, lots and lots of bugs			",54,15,7,2,11,0,3

There are no extra game play modes as 2014 had.  The steering is way off from F1 2014 and even with full traction control the car slides still it's ridiculous.  Less content, more problems...

												First of all. I've just gotten my copy of  F1 2015 from my game store today. I've downloaded it, launched it, expecting it to be a good one. The menu looks great, navigation not bad. When i went into quick race, start the race, i'm stuck on the grid. I'm using a D-pad to play on PC. When i press on RT, the car just doesn't move. I HAD to manually go to the controls settings to change the controls one-by-one. AND when i press B ( Back ) , it takes it as A ( Selects ). Seems like D-Pad is screwed on this game. In Flashback option, pressing X means flashback. However, i press X, it's just back. AND i HAD to press A ( which is pause ) to flashback. Not sure what's going on here. The throttle and brakes seems screwed as well. Lastly, by moving the left stick, which means turning left or right, i moved it slightly and the steering wheel already shows fully. WOW. Nice one there. Turning at a corner with the joystick moved slightly, turns the car fully. Graphics wise, i have nothing to say about it. Can barely see the rear mirror. Totally blur. 35minutes into the game i think i already need glasses. IF i continue any further, i am going to have eye cancer. http://imgur.com/kA0BgHZ , http://imgur.com/Z7PMKnU  , http://imgur.com/EfiwBCR ",18,1,7,0,10,0,1

												tl;dr : Skip this one... It's not worth it. If you haven't go back and buy 2013 and get the 90s cars and tracks. Good content, fun racing, good driving model, good tracks. This game isn't living up to it's hype. If you do buy this NOT ON PC!Biggest let down ever. No more career mode. Don't even bother getting this on PC because you cant do races longer than 5 laps. Obviously you can select to but you'll run out of fuel. You can't talk to your engineer on the pc version, only on consoles. You need to talk to him to even know about your tires of your ♥♥♥♥ing fuel. The driving model while at first seemed better in the end was far worse. I wouldn't even turn the wheel (all assist off) and it would take me out of a corner from right to left. I was getting oversteer and should have been in the wall but the game actually without any assist corrected it for me. Later on it felt so twitched it just wasn't natural. Not to mention there's a major input delay that can't be turned off.On a positive note the AI are much better. They will actually pass you now and try to defend. They allow you to play the 2014 season with 2014 cars and driver lineup. Possitives just kinda end there.I want to say the tracks are good but I've found the tracks are mapped incorrectly as well. In montreal you just fly past the wall of champions and really don't even turn. How did they ♥♥♥♥ up a track that they had in their previous games?! Honesly...There's also no safety car... Yeah and no word on why yet.			",94,2,13,4,6,0,21

												It's not a bad game at all actually. I played all games since F1 2010 to date, so have some experience in ""Codemasters"" thoughts of semi-simulations.What is missing in F1 2015 game is just ""Carrer mode"" and maybe some challenges, as we had in previous releases.I'm not interested in multiplayer, because there's lack of players in racing games anyway, so I don't bother. Since you're in single player mode - you have quite a good challenge from improved AI.PRO Season mode is something that I was unable to compete in, since I have only XBOX controller. PRO Season mode - tough challenge, no aids, legend competition, no visual guides, so you must be prepared for it. Anyway, I'm not an expert in game reviews, but this game is not a bad game, as most of community claims.+ Graphics+ Physics+ Improved AI+ Challenging Steam achivements+ Incl. 2014 season- No Carrer mode- No single player challenges- Lack of players in multiplayer			",81,23,42,6,29,2,10

No fix by CM.Horrible AI that ram into you. When people want aggressive AI, I don't think they were asking for ignorant psychopaths which drive into your rear end. Heck... F1 2013 had better AI which respected players/other drivers while being opportunistic. How they have actually reversed from making good/decent F1 games to terrible unplayable crap like this is beyond me. I have wasted $50 on this game.

												First i'll start with positive aspects of this game since there is not too much to say about this.Positives:-The new thing that I liked the most and you could only do it in the old F1 2006 is that you can spectate any racer from the pit during Practice/Qualifications. (Yes, with any pov and anyone)-I found all of the tracks better, in therm of graphics, if your specs are the one recommended or above then you will not have FPS drops playing at Ultra quality.-You can talk to your engineer while racing, it works with a mic, you can ask anything along the race, I did not expect this.-AI is more aggressive than previous games, and will try to overtake you in a corner or off the racing line. (Which causes crashes in most of the case, but it's still better than before.)That's all I found with the positives, now you'll understand why I rated this game that way.Negatives:-This game is unplayable with Keyboard , you need to have a Joystick otherwise you will just race off the track at every corner. So I took my Gamepad to try my best.-Gameplay changed too much, car handling is not perfect nothing near a real simulation. -AI is stupid (even more than previous games) and will drive into you, or will randomly ghost when you try to overtake them.-No more Safety car, no more Career Mode (I played only Career mode in their old games and I guess many did the same)-Collisions/Car damage is not realistic at all, as always we will need to wait until modders fix this, since CodeMasters will probably not.-The game gave me the worst corner cutting experience i've ever had. No jokes, even in F1 2006, 2010, 2013, 2014, it was more realistic when turning into corners. It just feels like the wheel does not turn but the car keeps turning like everything is fine.Well that's all I got to say, now if you're looking for an Arcade game then this is made for you, if you're looking for a true F1 experience (as they advertised) then you will be disappointed as Car handling even with all assists off is too unstable, no career mode and no safety car which is totally unrealistic.As they always do, they won't add anything until F1 2016 so they can get our money again just for 2-3 new features. That got me bored. Having new features that are cool but in the meantime they remove things that F*cks up the game.Next time i'll try it at a friend's house before giving away my money.

												Pros:- The visuals and sounds of the car are really beautiful, a huge step up from 2014- Pitting is a lot realistic in release time and wheel changing- Car handling is very good with controller but would be nice if there was a tweak feature like project car doesCons:- Lack of co-op feature although I don't do co-op I love watching other people do races on YouTube so this is a huge let down- AI all over the place and bumping into your car even though you're driving in a straight line. They will try to overtake but really love to hit your rear wheels and make you spin off track or into a wall. (Had to do 5 laps with Maldonado and Grosjean on my rear and can't count the amount of times I had to use flashbacks to correct the crashes they made me do)- This motion blur effect when pitting is weird as when you turn into your pit station it looks like the game is lagging pretty badly.- Championship mode lacks features of customising how you want your race weekend to go. Some people have a lot of time while others don't and just want to get into the race. Speeding up the time is very slow and would be nice to add a feature that can increase the time in steps.All in all the game can be good but I wouldn't recommend buying the game till all the problems have been resolved. Also the lack of features in the game the price should be no more than £20. Luckily I got mine for £27.99 on Amazon prime so I did save quite a bit than paying £39.99 but still I feel I paid more than what I should have.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I pre-order F1 2015 because of its new mechanics and game engine. However, when i started playing it all at Ultra High plus SMAA +TAA, 16x. It is a lil bit blurry i had to go to its folders and disable motion blur. Got it on XBOX One and i must say it was better than the Steam Version :(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												1. There is horrible microstutter which makes the game look jittery and choppy even when locked at 60 frames per second. Without vsync my system pushes around 90fps on the High preset - it still doesn't look smooth at all.2. The graphics are insanely blurry.3. Fanatec Clubsport V2 pedals are not properly supported, there is a massive unadjustable deadzone that means only a tiny amount of the brake pedal's movement actually has any effect in game. It is virtually impossible to brake like this, tapping the brakes doesn't work because the game doesn't detect anything while braking hard is an instant lock up because the range detected in game is so small I can basically only brake 100% or not at all. (It is not my pedals, they work fine in every other game including previous F1 games and there are reports of other people with the exact same issue).4. The game crashes every time on exit.5. Loading times are outrageously long.6. Why are the AA options so limited? TAA is atrocious and SMAA doesn't do much for the jaggies.I can't comment on the AI because I haven't raced against them seeing as the lack of support for my pedals makes the game unplayable.

												Wow, this is just another simple ported game. Has a high toy factor. :(I could not even simply drive and go. Setup is only accessible during a session.There was no setup menu in the first screen. Had to do the graphics setup through GForce Experience. Looked good afterwards.All controls look like a ported game. It is in fact just a simple port from the XB1 version.No feel in the wheel; FFB is not working out of the box. The wheel input is not direct enough for an F1 game.No good working presets for my Fanatec wheel. It was recognized but could only turn left.Even after creating a custom setup it feels like playing with a controller and not a wheel.It feels unconnected and vague.Obviously optimized for controller use.I wanted to do a few laps on the Hungaro ring for the upcoming F1 weekend in Hungary, but could not even drive normally.Used the ""Elite"" setting with all driving aids off. But even than it feels unconnected and unresponsive.For the more serious players this game is not a good choice. I can not recommend it. Too bad as i was looking forward to this game. Maybe the F1 license should go to SMS or another more serious Development Studio. Nice game for the wannabe F1 driver kiddos, but nothing serious. Even with the 50% discount a waste of money for me.6/10 score. Disappointing.			",205,88,45,33,66,5,72

												It pains me to write this, but don't buy this game. As a massive F1 fan I want so badly for these games to be good but they're just getting worse. No career mode is an absolute joke, it's like going back to the F1 97 days of just having a championship mode, except that was a great game. The driving itself feels pretty good and I like the options you have in terms of communicating with the team while driving, but the graphics just look a bit strange to me, like a bit too glossy I think. Also the damage is absolutely awful. I T-boned Ricciardo at a hairpin to test it out and was left without a front wing but zero other damage!!! I was under the impression that F1 2014 was poor so that the team could focus on 2015, and now I read that they weren't happy with the career mode so will probably leave it until 2016, but why should I believe them? So disappointing...			",99,25,8,17,13,0,11

												I have to say I agree with the negative comments here, first time I started the game...it crashed. I tried again after a reboot and it took an age to load (I have an i7 by the way so not a slow machine). Unlike Project cars F1 2015 didn't automatically detect my Logitech G27 wheel , not a big issue but just had to go to settings and select it.The the game starts and man, its blurry! the car feels like its on ice, all over the place, the handling is no where near as good as Project Cars. I'm very disappointed. I'm a big fan of F1 and was looking forward to this, I hope they fix it urgently but the game shouldn't have been released in this state, its not finished by the looks of it!bring back geoff crammond!

												Honestly, the game is a challenge to get used to - I'm not disputing that at all. It's good to have a challenge. However, there are too many other problems with the game that are just too big to ignore. Predominantely:- Graphics: While they are good, Codies have gone from looks over actual gameplay and functionality.- Multiplayer: is absolutely woeful. It's impossible to race against anyone effectively when the game can't keep up with who is where on the track. All of a sudden, you get told you're in first, and before you even cross the line, someone else has crossed it and pops up a fastest lap.- Push to Talk: Why was this stripped out of the game? I don't want to voice everyone in the game if I'm speaking to someone privately in a TS Server.- Glitches: ie: refer my posted screen shot - how the hell can a car drive around on rims!?!?!? This isn't the only one.- Gameplay assists: There's absolutely NO difference between Traction Control being off and on Medium. There was at least some difference on 2014.- Steam Achievements and Trading Cards: Despite doing at least 10 clean laps around Russia in a Marrusia in Time Trial, the game fails to recognise these laps towards the achievement - I don't know why. The game also claims to have Steam Trading cards - I'm yet to see any after nearly 4 hours of play, and a friend has 10 times as many hours (40) and hasn't seen any either. So the Trading Cards are a blatant lie at this stage.Codies - if you bothered to look at the Meta Scores in Steam for your games since 2010, they have been steadilly declining, with 2014 being the worst of the last 5. Your track record suggests that this one will be the worst of the lot. If you can't get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together, you don't deserve a renewal to make more of these games from FOM.There's just one question remaining: Did anyone at Codemasters even bother to test this game PROPERLY before it was released?**EDIT: SInce my review, allegedly, trading cards have been released. **			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can't reccomend the game in it's current state as it doesn't support controllers properly.I first tried using a DualShcok 4 through DS4Windows, but that made the camera flick erratically between different angles constantly, making the game unplayable.I then switched to a Logitech F510 (an offically-supported PC gamepad), and the game doesn't work properly with that either. In DirectInput mode, the game thinks the X button is the B button, the A button is the B button and so on. It also locks the brakes on as soon as you start a session, so again unplayable.I tried the pad in the archaic XInput mode, and while the game does seem to recognise it as a gamepad, the R2 and L2 buttons in XInput mode work like switches rather than triggers, so you're throttle and brakes are either 0% on or 100% on, with no middle ground. This also makes the cars completely undriveable, and the game unplayable.There's absolutely NO excuse for selling a game with such fundamental playing errors. At the moment, you can't even call it a game, because you can't play it AT ALL. I don't know if CodeMasters have left the PC port 'til the last minute, or don't think that controller support is necessary for their games, or if they were forced to release the game in such a state to satisfy contractual demands with the Formula 1 licensing body, but whatever the reason, they've royally screwed over their fans and their customers.I cannot reccomend this game to anyone.

												I have to say, I'm beyond disapointed.  I will be steam refunding.  Spending my time in Project Cars.- Setting up a wheel is a painful process of trial and error, starting and restarting the game.  Why no in game calibration?- No hud customization?- BUGS, BUGS, BUGS.  Don't release games that arent ready!- Went to play pro mode (all assists forced off) and all the assists were forced on?- Munus are a navigational nightmare.  Descriptions promise options that arent even there?- No Safety car- No Career mode- graphics are worse than F1 2012 evenWe forgave you Codemasters for F1 2014 on promise that 2015 was going to be better, I'm done with Codemasters F1 games, time to hand over the F1 license to Project Cars.

												Do Not Buy This Shamefull Thing They Call ""Game""! Its is Buggy, The graphics are just cosmetic blurish over the same stuff from f1 2010, Even the hand holding the steering wheel clip through the car...There`s no Career, you cannot downshift if the revs are too high... There`s no way to do a full qualifying and less than 100% race. If you want to do a 50% Race you HAVE to do a short qualifying...I can`t even get a refund from this because I spent more than 2h just fiddling in the options trying to get this **** whorking properly.The sad thig is, F1 2010 was a great game (career mode wise). How come after 5 years there is less and less content? And even now you still cannot drive your car in the pit lane.SHAME!			",51,6,12,4,18,0,6

												Unless you're a die hard F1 fan, don't buy it yet.  The game looks blurry and is filled with bugs.  It has potential but as of July 11th, it's just not ready.  It's hard to believe that a company that has been making F1 games for a while would forget something like the Safety Car.  Also the damage model is bad. Real bad.			",24,3,10,1,6,0,1
