												Another Game you just Start for the Cards....Atleast I can make one 100xp Badge now.If you like simple turned based physics games, this might be worth to pick up, but i wouldn't recommend it in any ways..			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Extremly simple physics based 'ball' game. The presentation is neat, but that's about all going for the game. The game itself is bland, very bland. You control three Adorables that can shoot in a direction of your choice in turns. Your opponent has another three Adorables that do the same. There are three modes that are essentially the same: Soccer, Ice Hockey and Beach Ball. Then there's Last Man Standing and Mummy (which are basically the same thing). The last mode is capture the flag. All modes play almost the same and there are no specials to lighten up the rather boring game play.If you like very simple turned based physics games this might be worth to pick up in a sale or a bundle, but otherwise I wouldn't bother to get it.
