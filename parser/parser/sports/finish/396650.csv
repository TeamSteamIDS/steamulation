Early Access Review
								Do I recommend it, even though this is only the first episode? Yes I do.The scores below are from 1 to 10, 1 being terrible, 5 being average and 10 being excellent. I am confident in this Visual Novel and I think it can be one of the best Western Visual Novels. Keep in mind that the scale I am using is the same that I use to evaluate japanese visual novels (like Grisaia no Kajitsu):Story: Not rated at the moment (episode 1)Since this is only the first episode and was pretty much about introductions (and there's still another girl to be introduced in the next episode), I can't rate the story. My personal thoughts are that this is going to be a straightforward comedy slice of life romantic visual novel, so I don't expect any serious developments or mind blows.There's not really much I can say about writing. It focuses on the dialogue and the protag thoughts, and doesn't waste time in detailing objects/sceneries. It's an easy to read writing and direct to the point.There are some references and easter eggs. One of the best scenes in this visual novel is a small battle between the MC, Kaori and a Tech Gosu. Their battle is a little parody between Android, Apple and Microsoft. Another is when choosing a movie, you get to choose a movie of a list of movies that all are based off real movies, and the characters leave their comment on it.Visuals: 7The backgrounds are just too good. The artist makes such a good job of using lightning to give more life to the backgrounds.The characters also look good in my opinion. The big drawback here is that, probably due to financial limits, secondary characters don't have fully drawn sprites. Meaning that their sprites are just black figures.Gameplay: 9This visual novel, just like many others, is about making choices. Difference is that this one has tons of choices that drastically change the story, while the others only have a few. If you need a comparison, compare it to Walking Dead videogame from Telltalles games. Some choices only change a few lines, while others change a lot of what happens. For example, earlier in the game, you can choose to go to school by bus or with the bike. Depending on what you choose, it will change what characters you meet first and what will happen in the next day. Not only that, but if you decide to be an A hole with someone, that someone will remember it later and act accordingly.There's also the rollback feature. Rollback is the feature that allows you to rollback to your previous choice and choose another option. In this VN, you are asked in the begginning if you want to disable it. If you do, you will get achievements and ""other possible goodies"".You can also name your protagonist and choose his background trait: athletic, intelligent and intuitive. If you choose to be athletic, you will have no problem carrying luggage, if you choose to be intelligent, other characters might ask for your help with the studies, etc. This also sometimes highlights the best options in some choices, for example, if the teacher asks a question, the correct answer will be highlighted if you chose the intelligent trait.This visual novel also features mini games. In the first episode, there are two type of mini games, if there will be more or not in the future I don't know. One is a simple press the right combination of 5 buttons scattered around the screen. In this episode, it appears only once to callibrate the MC's mech. To be honest that minigame feels unnecessary (especially because your penalty for failing is just repeating the mini game), however one of the devs said that he plans to use it again later, so I assume that this one can serve as a tutorial kind of thing.The other mini game is the combat. I am pleased that they improved it a lot since the alpha. Now it's a lot better and it feels like I am actually doing some damage. This mini game is simple: Just press WASD according to what appears on the screen. If it appears W, press W and your combo will go up. You have limited energy and the enemy has HP. Depending on how well you do in the combat, the other characters will react to it (if you did well, they will praise you, etc). However, the bad side is that the mini game is too easy (for me at least).Sound: 7They really did a good job here. The music is good and one of the tracks even got stuck in my ear (it's one that plays when riding the bike if we choose to go to school with it). That's a lot more than I can say for many visual novels. You see, I am like this: if I like the music that is playing, I continue to play the VN with it on, if I don't, I turn off the music and play my own. I didn't turn off the music in this VN.The voice acting is also good. The voices match very well with the characters (Shou especially). Obviously, we are talking about low budget voice acting, so don't expect voice acting on Morgan Freeman level (aka God level). It's good, but not something that will blow you away. But considering that one can count english voice acted visual novels with just one hand, this is a really good effort from the devs.However, there are at least two moments where secondary characters don't have voice. Considering that I reported this in the last alpha, I am going to assume that their lack of voice is intentional and not a bug. This is weird because everyone else is voiced. I will update this if they add voices later.Characters: Not going to rate yetSome of the characters are inspired by your usual japanese anime stereotypes, like tsundere. However, they don't shamessly try to imitate them to the letter, which is good, because english voice acting + japanese stereotypes = usually not a good idea. It's not by chance that ""Idiot!"" doesn't sound as good as ""baka!"" at the end of ""I didn't do it because I like you, baka!""In the first episode, you are introduced to an uncle (Kaito), sister (Nikki), friend (Shou) and the romantic options: Mayu, Yuuna and Kaori. There's also a french girl appearing in the next episode, Belle (Ooh là là). And there's also other guy that you may or may not meet in this episode depending on your choices, Akira (I got my eye on you, you white haired *insert swear here*)Because we are only in the first episode, and also because I'm lazy, I will refrain for now from talking of each one individually, but what I can say is that they feel compeling and I want to know more about them.Enjoyment: 9I am a sucker for choices. I am a sucker for consequences. So I had a blast replaying it multiple times and roleplay differently each time.The only complaint I have is that this episode felt a bit shorter compared with the original demo, but other than that, it was fun.Final rating: 8 (episode 1)TL;DR:Just buy it! I kid. You should buy it if:- You like light hearted stories;- You like mechas;- You like tons of choices;- You like easter eggs/references;- You want to support western VN's.You shouldn't buy it if:- You want a serious story (again, this is based off of the first episode, it might get serious moments later on for all I know);- You don't like any kind of mini games in visual novels;- You prefer more linear stories.If you have any questions or you want to point out something, feel free to comment. I will reply as soon I notice it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow. So, this one came in as a complete surprise. I didnt expect much when i bought it, but boy was I wrong.TL;DR:Pros:  Intriguing Story  Good, genuinly funny writing  Tons of choices, that also have an impact  Unique and likeable characters  Fully voice-acted  Decent length  Nice Artstyle & SoundtrackCons:  Abrupt, unsatisfying ending  Minor: Artwork occasionally gets re-usedIn Detail:Pixelfade. Never heard of that Developer before, nor about the game itself. So I expected a pretty run-of-the-mill Visual Novel...This was not what I got. The CharactersThe character cast in ACE Academy was great across the board for me. The romancable characters are unique and differ heavily from each other, but all of them are very likeable.Other characters such as your best friend, or your little sister etc. are just as loveable. The Dynamic between them is great and the game manages to convey a real sense of belonging. You feel like a real part of the group. The StoryThe Story is what I would probably classify as mildly interesting. That doesnt mean it's bad, far from it. For a VN it's actually rather intriguing and does the job well enough. It's nothing revolutionary, but compared to a lot of other VN I would say it is above average. RomancesNow as mentioned before there are 4 romancable characters.Each of them has unique traits but all of them have very rewarding and heartwarming moments in their respective routes.Through the excellent writing the progression of these romantic relationships also feels pretty natural and not forced. Game Length & Choices After doing all the routes I capped at roughly 20 hours. Now, I will not lie, I didnt really check my playtime after I first reached the ending , but it should last you a good 10 hours.However that is only if you play through it once, there are a lot of reason to play through it several times.At the start of the game you name your MC and select 1 out of 3 personality types. Depending on your type you will get unique dialogue choices as well as different outcomes in some events.In additon to that you also have the above mentioned different romances that I encourage you to explore.Lastly this game throws a ton of choices at you from the get go. Some may just slightly alter a dialogue, but there are also a lot that affect the story and that have actual impact.One important thing that I'd like to mention here is, that you also have the choice to be a total♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ You may end up alone doing so, but hey - you can!The Ending  (Spoilerfree)Without revealing too much - The ending is very sudden. I expected at least 1 or 2 hours more before reaching it.Alas the story came to a ""close"" pretty quickly. Now I say ""close"" because it is somewhat of an open ending. That's the only real gripe I have with it.Overall:It's funny, has great characters and gives the player a lot of choice, but the ending is a bit of a letdown.I'd say if you have an interest in VN this game is worth full-price. On a sale I would lable it as a must-have without hesitation.Kaori is best girl!About the Developer:I do want to take a minute to write about the developer. As mentioned above, I didn't know about them before.But because the game was so enjoyable I checked them out a bit (mostly to see if and when part 2 is coming out) and I was very pleasently surprised.Originally only 2 romancable characters were planned. 1 more was added before the Kickstarter stretchgoal was reached and another one was changed to also be romancable due to popular demand.I also checked out a dev stream they hosted and they seemed genuinly passionate about what they were doing.I'm writing this for 2 reasons; I like what I found out about them. Listening to customer feedback is really important in my opinion and that is what they are doing. I dig that, and I want them to be successfull. The ACE universe is much bigger than what is in the first game. But currently there are no plans for a Sequel. That's a nono! I want them to get more money and make the sequel happen! Do it!
