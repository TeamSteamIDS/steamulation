												i've played this game about 300+ hours but its original cased game, not on steam (my brother gift it on steam last month)pros+ not complicated as new manager games+ detailed attirbutes+ more realistic matches (i dont refer graphics) than new manager games + not needs high reqs+ you can analize matches with ProZone+ huge and detailed database (you can see icelandic free agent players)cons- matches looks like table-football matches- childish menus ,fonts and bad themes- it ruins your life :(note : we want  cm 14!!!
