												Old school Karate action done right in the 2D world drawing on influences of some of the most challenging competition games ever made from Karate Champ to Street Fighter.  No crazy complex combos, the simple controls allow for strategic planning of your moves precisely when used in this competitive fighter.  Many games people buy because their cheap then never play one hour of them, this game is to awesome to not play.   This game does the hardest thing in gaming, taking a simple concept and making it fun to play with working controls.  The competition style of the game uses a variety of moves that force the player NOT to just mash the buttons but plan each move to become a black belt master of their own.  The game is riddled with spelling errors and sentences that make no sense, but all that anyone needs to understand is ""Karate is life!!!!""  At first many will think the strange phrasing of sentences is some kind of retro feel, though after checking their website, it seems to just be the way they write in general for whatever reason.   Either way it is awesome and fits the game perfectly.  This game has the most important aspect working flawlessly, the ai opponents are challenging and its never the same fight twice.  The music in the game is just as hardcore as the visuals.  Sick of boring drawn out realistic hipster type games from the last few years?  If so then karate Master 2 is your cure!   As the game says, get ready to ""get covered in glory.""  How often does anyone get to say that?  Imagine someone asking you how your day is, now finally you can reply saying you are covered in glory. What a good day to be you!Rating:  10/10  Value:  $9.99 *for those who want the awesomesauce of Karate Master 1, its free from the developer and can be downloaded on their official website:  http://www.criansoft.com/eng/Karate%20Master%20KDB.html ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

  Introduction            	Karate Master 2 Knock Down Blow is fighting/arcade game. It gives everyone nostalgia with the great retro feel. The gameplay is very fun, from the fighting to the minigames. Some opponents have different fighting styles and this makes the game a lot more varied, but the grindy nature of this game is a huge turn-off for me. The cheesy 90s take on this game makes it very funny and interesting to play and with mash of game genres, Karate Master 2 Knock Down Blow is tons of fun. The only real issues anyone will have with game is the fact that it’s grindy at times and the repetitive music.   Pros                Retro style  Comedy Cool fighting mechanics  Good price Free mode to practice  Fun minigames    Cons               Repetitive at times  Bad keyboard support Repetitive music     Conclusion                 	Karate Master 2 Knock Down Blow is a retro fighting/rpg/karate/arcade game that has great minigames, brutal fighting, retro style, and cheesy 90s gameplay. With a 9.99 USD price tag, Karate Master 2 Knock Down Blow is tons of fun and if you like cheesy retro fighting games this is a must have for you. -HiPFiRED   If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupCheck out the Original Network Groups.

												I am really digging this game.It kinda has an SNK fighting game feel to it, but there is a skill progression that really adds depth and playthrough time to the game.  As you progress further in your stats, you unlock new training minigames that really help keep them from feeling stale.As for the controls, they're pretty tight for being an indie title.  However, the game assumes you have an Xbox 360 controller, as the on-screen button prompts are of the A+B+X+Y variety, makes it confusing if you're using a keyboard.  Personally, I'm using a USB-connected SNES controller and it works beautifully with this game.The graphics really capture the feel of the transitional period between the 16-bit and 32-bit console eras (think NEO-GEO), and they are of much higher quality than your average indie fare.The sound effects and music really make this game shine, once again perfectly capturing that bygone era that a lot of us spent middle school listening to as we played our games.If I were to criticize anything, it would probably be the rough translation job, but it's a minor slight that doesn't take away from the game much at all.The devs have some real talent, and this game is well worth the $10.  I'd like to see where they go from here.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In Karate Master 2 Knock Down Blow you take up the quest of a visionary man (Player 1) on his quest to open up his own karate school.  The reason why Player 1 wants to open up a karate school is so that he can pass down his style of karate (which is identical to the style used by every other karateka in the game).  Being that his city only has 10 karate dojos (other than the one he wants to buy and open) and 4 dedicated karate tournaments, there is obviously a vast untapped market for Player 1's tutelage.  There are two main ways to fufill Player 1's dream: putting boxes on a truck with a forklift and getting famous enough to participate in the advanced karate tournaments that actually have monetary prizes and don't cost money to do.  In practice, even if you opt for the second way of raising the necessary funds, you will have to do the forklift minigame every few attempts at the tournament.  Much like the path of a real karateka the game is very grindy and repetitive, but you'll have some fun if you buy it on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had absolutely no expectations for this game but I'm having a lot of fun with it at the moment! It's an amusing Fighting/RPG hybrid with charming retro graphics so if that sounds like your kind of game then do pick it up!Pros: + Nice graphics+ Good combat system+ Good impact on the blows, landing an axe kick which cracks the opponent's skull is very satisfying+ Some opponents have different fighting-styles which makes the game a bit more varied.Cons:- Very grindy, may get repetitive- Lack of tutorial and very shallow explanation on how to perform certain moves- Some spelling mistakes here and thereFinal rating: 8/10.

												This game tells the story of my life, with one major difference:After getting a cracked skull from a mawashi geri (ICHIGEKI HISATSU!), my in-game girlfriend was more considerate to me than my real life girlfriend after an getting an ACL tear in a real karate tournament. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I must say I love this game. So retro, yet so good. Great graphics with superb animation, fun minigames. Can be kind of a grind, but a decent challenge.One thing I would like to see is more knockdown animations, appropriate to where the hit connects. For some people, the lack of MP might turn them out, but it doesn't prevent this from being a great game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nineteen eighty five called, it would like to have a word with you about cheesy Karate games. Specifically, I would like you to cast your mind back to the spectrum era. Long loading times, terribad graphics, but a blank canvas where game creativity was about pushing boundaries and exploring what games could be. One of those many explorations was a title called IK+ (International Karate +), a glorious bit of code involving some pixellated men in pyjamas whacking each other in the goal of changing their belt colours. The controls were tight, the fighting was good, and the feeling was very much that of a cheesy b-movie. Hell, the Amiga version had Stephen Segal (or a very good likeness)[www.atarimania.com] on the cover along with what looks to be Chuck Norris delivering a trademark kick to some poor sod. Fighting games have wavered in and out of vogue, travelling between the more realistic and the more fantastical over the generations, but the pure, basic Karate game sortof vanished into the ether...... UNTIL NOW...... KAHATAE MASTAH. NOCKA DOON BALOO. OSU!It's gloriously throwback, the graphics are retro Amiga era, the script has more chinglish than a motherboard manual, you get to Karate Fight a bull and a bear (yes, you get the opportunity to punch a bear), and you get to do a jump kick over a car to promote your dojo. It's that kind of finely matured cheese. Jackie Chan would be -proud- to feature in such a script. It has so much terribleness (like the fact you can exit without saving very easily and the game does a TERRIBLE job of warning you) that it has no right to be as good as it is. Yet, it is. It's good, it's good in the way finely matured cheese is good.The game features a mix of tournaments, one shot fights against various opponents (who if you beat, will then appear in the said same tournaments), special encounters such as the aforementioned ""DO A FLYING KICK OVER A CAR!"", and occasional expositions of horribly written story, with english so badly written even google translate looks at me and throws it's arms up in despair. You can read it, and you'll laugh, it's that wonderfully bad. In between the fighting and the b-reel script you get to train your fighter in a fantastically diverse set of mini-games (some are genius, others... not so much), and there's a limited RPG style progression system where you'll tinker with the stats of your fighter, and can even suffer injuries and get to participate in a mini game where you have to recover from those (and the first time that happens, you get some cringeworthy story for that too).The fighting however is -good-, really good, it uses the tekken style approach of mapping left and right legs and arms to seperate buttons, and then you can apply ""low"" or ""high"" using down or up on the controller to give you a wide variety of punches and kicks. There's a good set of combos and a fairly fluid system tucked away in here, as well as a solid blocking and countering system, and button mashing is punished frequently with the AI giving you a damn good spanking in the later stages, so it pays to learn the intricacies. In effect, this is IK+ put on steroids, and then given a serious training regimen, the Karate is pretty full featured (at least that an outside layperson can figure) and has a much more realistic, crunchy feel to it, as opposed to the more fantasy based fighters that you tend to run into.Training focusses on the various stats, or training you in new moves, the stat training can range from simple button mashing (for body conditioning, which will give you hand cramp, well, they did say it was toughness training - BEAR THE PAIN), to attempting to hit a tennis ball suspended by a piece of string, which feels a bit like the human version of a cat playing with a feather. Generally speaking some minigames work really well (the concrete bag, the strength tests, some of the toughness tests) and there's only a few real duds (the water droplet test can die in a fire). There's even a minigame where you work to build up funds to enter the starter tournaments, which... can go horribly wrong if you decide to fiddle about with your forklift (there's safety videos for that you know!).With all this said, would one recommend it? At the price point it's pitched at? Absolutely. It's a -steal-. There's a lot to do in this game, and it'll keep you busy easily for a good few evenings or a solid weekend, and you may well return to it every so often for a theraputic bit of Karate fighting in the later tournaments, even after you master the game. It's excellent value, and as a b-movie, modernised IK+, it's an easy sell. If you're into fighting games and fancy a change of pace, grab this and give it a whirl.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had a lot of fun with this game!...But it's a ♥♥♥♥ing insult that this was released in the state that it is for the price. It is one of the buggiest, crytpic, unpolished games I have ever played. I'm convinced the team spent more time making the trailer than bug testing.Map screen audio settings independant from the rest of the game? Check.The game alt-tabbing itself on KOs? Check.Losing a match to an opponent you KOd? Check.Randomly losing training points? Check.Manual with very little info and no documentation? Check.Awful Engrish? Czech. (Though a bit charming.)Poor menus and general user interface? Check.And random crashes? You bet!It's a real shame because I still enjoyed it and there is great combat beneath the abrasive buggy exterior but this feels like an unfinished flash game, I guess there's no quality control on products released on steam!

												An amazing retro style arcade Karate game with a fun story mode which will have you progress through your fighter's life.  You will work to earn money, train your fighter in different techniques, level up your skills, compete in different style tournaments and even challenge rival gyms.  The game works great with my Xbox controller and the moves are easy to execute.  This is a really fun game and I love it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Knock Down Blow is largely a martial arts sports game, sharing more in common with Budoken (1989) and the like than most other fighting games. It does not feature magic attacks, energy blasts, or even flips; but rather fists, feet, blood, sweat, tears, karate, forklifts and a bear. This provides for a more realistic, restrained, visceral and violent experience that defies the game’s appearance and feels quite unique to the genre.With liver injuries, skull fractures, brain damage and more all lovingly recreated, this game delivers a real sensation of beating the crap out of someone else, which will appeal to many Steam users. However, Karate Master also delivers a sensation of having the crap beat out of you, which many Steam users will relate to.Some of the training exercises depicted are tedious, some are momentarily fun. And while there is a cheese strategy or two for the actual fighting, timing and technique are rewarded and the results are most satisfying.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
