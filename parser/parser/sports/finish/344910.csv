												The top-rated helpful review compares this game positively to 3D shmups like Star Fox and urges the reader to purchase this game immediately if they enjoy the others. Don't do that.Since the comparison to Star Fox has already been made, I'm going to roll with it. We're going to be focusing on the similarities and differences between this game and Star Fox 64, which might seem unfair once I get into it, but 64 is eighteen years old and this game came out this year.First off, the flying. Your ship (no matter which one you select,) has no real weight to it. It floats gleefully around the screen with such speed that it highlights more especially than anything the stirring lack of actual control you have over it and the lack of any real animation to it. The ship floats where you point it and that's it. No maneuvering, no complexity of control, and no real animation to the motion besides a slight tilt in the direction you're heading.Okay, the flying's not great, but 3D shmups are more about the shooting anyway. Star Fox 64 had satisfyingly fast shooting with incrimental power upgrades for your lasers. This game SORT OF has a similar upgrade, but it is automatically collected - no challenge there - and only serves to slightly speed up your INCREDIBLY SLOW AND INACCURATE SHOOTING. Your shots don't arc based on motion or follow the angle of your ship, they go forward on a fixed line, meaning you need to line up perfectly with your enemy to shoot them. This would be a small flaw if your ship didn't block most of the screen and make actually seeing and lining up with an enemy an incredibly difficult effort that ultimately only serves to crash your ship into the target and not actually give any meaningful award or feedback for shooting the target down.The screen is locked exactly as it is, so your range of motion is incredibly limited. This wouldn't be an issue considering the complete LACK OF DIFFICULTY for most of the game, but sooner rather than later, enemies and their attacks start tracking you. With the screen locked as it is and your ship as floaty and unresponsive as it is, you very quickly start losing life to attacks you've got almost no chance of escaping. This is what we call ARTIFICIAL DIFFICULTY. It's when a stupidly easy game makes a stupid and hamfisted attempt to make itself not so stupidly easy.There's little to no variety in the levels. Honestly, the major difference between one level and the next is what enemy or threat you're meant to be shooting or avoiding. There's briefly an in-door segment with metal walls to avoid, but it's not contextualized as a huge enemy ship or planet or base or anything, and once it's done you're back to the completely linear space hallway.The visual style is incredibly lazy. Nothing looks interesting or memorable in any way, and the utter lack of animation beyond direct motion kills any sort of interest the bland designs and lazy attacks might generate.I'd like to say there's something positive to this game to help redeem it or maybe make it more aggrieving that the rest is so lazy and boring, but there isn't.I can't put in the effort to be mad at a game that didn't have any effort put into at all.TL;DR Slow, boring, lazy, ugly, and uninpsired. No matter what other games you enjoy, pass this one up. It's not worth your time, let alone your money.0/10 (NOT WORTH RATING)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Here we have another game that can be summed up in a single word: YIKES!It's cute that Sun Blast's store description not only has the gall to claim that it was inspired by Star Fox, Space Harrier, and Panzer Dragoon, but it also says that it's ""the best 3d space shooter on Steam"".Sun Blast was inspired by a dumpster fire. Never before have I played a shooter with such poor mechanics, sluggish controls, and awful mission-design. Dodging enemy ships and their bullets should be a relatively simple task, but instead it's messy and somewhat convoluted. This can be attributed to the odd perspective. It's not always clear where objects are in relation to the player-ship. So this results in lots of collisions. The bosses tend to have homing weapons, and they're exceedingly frustrating to deal with. Why? Because the player-ship can't maneuver around them, and the angle makes it difficult to tell where the homing shots are heading.In shootemups, dodging a single bullet should be as easy as breathing. The developer makes the game more difficult by increasing the speed of that bullet, adding more of them, giving them unique properties, and so on. It's the constantly building intensity that keeps these games challenging. Sun Blast somehow manages to accomplish the opposite. Dodging a single bullet is far more trouble than in any other game I've played. The missions are exceedingly generic and dull. For the most part they're also extremely easy, except for the bosses. Whenever I had to replay the last few stages, because I died at the boss, all I could do was nod my head and think ""Yep. I expected this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.""  If I spend enough time with Sun Blast, eventually I could learn to handle it's many terrible qualities. But why? This game suffers from a total dearth of entertainment value. Before I forget, let's take a look at this statement: ""the best 3d space shooter on Steam"". I can't claim to know the Steam Store's library well enough to confirm that this is false. However, I will point out that Space Harrier II is available on the service. While it hasn't aged well, and the frame-rate is worse than Sun Blast's, this relic from the 16-bit era is a much better game. I suppose it doesn't include enough ""3D"" or ""space"" to fit the criteria, but it might actually be worth your time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A interesting and ok game with the feel of Star FoxPros:+Cheap+Gamepad support+Unlockable challenges+3 different game modes+Has achievements and trading cards+While not the same or largely similar it does have a Star Fox feel to it+Simple gameplay, easy to pick up and play, also has the option for autofiringCons:-The levels are short-Little variation in levels-Shooting system is bad-Movement isn't that good-The 3 ships have little in differences-Identical enemies, not a lot of variation-Difficulty, the game gets hard rather fast-Some attacks just seem impossible to dodge-The ships are too big and cover a lot of the screen-Terrible compard to Star Fox which is what people compare this game toDownload Size: 89mbTrading Cards: 5 cards in the setAchievement Difficulty: Moderately difficult to 100%Hours to 100%: 10-14Rating: 5/10Recommendation: An ok game to pick up and play due to cheap price, but nothing greatMy Opinion:I do not recommend this game at it's full price, it's mediocre at best and doesn't offer a lot of enjoyment due to repetitive material in the game. If it is on sale and is very cheap I'd say give it a go since it usually goes for like 19p on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At £0.19, this game is worth it. I would in no way recommend buying at £4.I've not played a lot of this game, but I don't really need to: it is a slightly clunky but perfectly playable game. It's the kind of thing you'd expect to find in a bargin bin, but along side the original Virtua Fighter or Pac-Man: Good but dated. Which is funny, because this isn't an old game, it just isn't very complicated.Comparisons against classics of the genre are overly generous, but fans of the genre looking for a cheap & cheerful time-filler will enjoy this game's flatter-by-mimicry content. It even has unlockable 'challenges', which is a nice touch! Add to that the fact that this game will probably run on a toaster and what you have is a nice little offering. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DISCLAIMER: I was given a key for free by the publisher!Do you like 3D shmups reminiscent of Star Fox? If your answer is yes, then hit the buy button and have fun.Everybody else, read on:Gameplay is robust and gets the job well done, movement is highly responsive and can be tweaked to the players preference by selecting from various ships to control. Furthermore there is even an auto-fire option.The levels are split into 3 categories:1. Shoot as many enemies as you can while trying to not get hit. After downing several you will recieve upgrades to your weapon as well as a shield (final upgrade, can take 1 hit unpunished). Obviously by getting hit the current upgrade will be lost.2. Survival which is basically all about dodging stuff.3. Boss battle.Additionally challenges will be unlocked by progressing through the main campaign.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My First Impressions Video:


YouTube™ Video: Sun Blast - First Play & Impressions 

			Views: 1,291		

			My First Impressions and gameplay video of the new arcade shooter game called SUN BLAST! Get this game on Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/344910/		

Old school 3D graphics with the ability to move both horizontally side to side and vertically as well.  The game is pretty fun with different levels each changing up the targets and obstacles on screen, everything from asteriods to big spiked indesuctible metal balls to enemy ships.Pros: - Acceptable 3D old school sprite style graphics- Movement is responsive and fast paced- Dodging the oncoming asteroids and ships is actually fun- Blowing stuff up, despite the lackluster explosions is satisfying- levels change it up each time you advance, so you're always doing something a little different from the last levelCons:- No 360 twin stick controller support (at the time of this review but a developer has said such support is planned)- No score to be seen while playing the levels (Even though it adds up your score at the end of each level, the score could still be kept during the gameplay, and an assessment of the score at the level end could be done and then player could recieve a bonus is applicable)- No real power ups or ability to ""skill up"" your ship to move faster, shoot faster etc that I saw- defeating enemies and blowing up asteroids is wayyy too basic and lackluster.  Big explosions would be very nice in a game like this, especially in the year 2015, not seeing more satisfying explosions is disappointingOverall, this game is easily worth it's asking price of $3.99 USD and certainly it's sale price.  While you likely won't be spending dozens of hours in this game, if you get an hour or two of fun out of it total over the next month or two, then it's more then worth the price tag.  Advice: I would wait until the support is added for a twin stick controller (Xbox 360 controller support) especially if you enjoy playing games like this with a controller over a keyboard.My Rating:  65% out of 100 (But this rating is moved up to a 75% considering its low price tag) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

-Quick Review-Sun Blast is a 3d-ish, space shooter-ish, developed by OBLONE Software and released April 2, 2015. In Sun Blast you move up down left or right while shooting and dodging.

-Detailed breakdown review-Warning: This is going to be a salty review. That being said, who knows... maybe you'll like this game more then I did. Maybe Sun Blast will capture your heart... I will admit I haven't played any other ""starfox inspired"" space shooter games on steam.Story: There is no story. Outside of the flavor text written on this game's store front.

Gameplay: I don't want to compare this game to star fox because Star fox is a game I actually enjoyed playing, whereas I did not enjoy Sun Blast at all. I would discourage anyone to attempt to play this game with a keyboard, and recommend you turn on auto fire (so you can spam fire while auto firing).Lets just examine each ""feature"" on the store front:1) Full gamepad supportYes, they even have wii motion controls, for any of you on steam whom have a wiimote.2) Three ship designs to choose from, each with unique look and behaviorOne ship moves right and left a tiny bit faster the then others and up and down slower, one moves up and down a tiny bit faster and left and right slower, and the third moves up and down at a medium pace (so it's not strong in one area and weak in the other)I didn't notice a difference between the ships in any real significant way.3) Fight against stealthy fighters and gigantic starshipsAre there stealthy fighters? Yes, there are about 2 types of star ship fighters, and 3 different types of starship ""bosses"".4) Huge level selection, from planet orbits to underground tunnels to infested military basesThis is the one I have the problem with. There are only about 4 or 5 different types of levels: Survival levels, shoot down a number of ships levels, dodge and break apart rocks levels, timed levels, any mix of the aforementioned levels... and boss levels.THEN, they reskin the pretty background, and have you do the same levels over, changing the ships on the level, and changing the ""NPC"" or ""target"" density.In a game like starfox dynamic events would take place, even if you were playing more of a rain shooter at certin points of the game, you'd need to shoot an enemy chasing after a friendly, sometimes a friendly would save you... There's nothing which changes from level to level. It's either: shooting to get enough kills, or dodging to get through a mine field.5) Replay levels to earn medalsThose are the challenges, and they  relate to:6) Steam achievements and leaderboardsMost people will get this game exclusively for the steam trading cards, for the sake of trading card mills. which... I mean, if that's your goal of this game, you'll get your money's worth, but my review relates to the game itself.In other words the most redeeming qualities for Sun Blast is: wiimote support, the music is good at first but then gets repetitive, and steam trading cards.

Conclusion: Now comes my softening statements of remorse... I've clearly explained why I dislike this game... The problem: someone worked on this game. It's not pretty, it's not fun. But it's cheap, you get trading cards, and at least it's a little different.The problem is there's no real motivation to keep playing, and I don't feel like when I die it was really my fault and could have been avoidable. I use Super Meat Boy as my go-to for samples of ""difficult, but fair"". It could extend to any number of classic Arcade-styled video games, like Pacman or Galaga.If the only way to get all the achievements and to be GOOD at Sun Blast is to learn the levels like someone would learn Pacman or Galaga, then I guess I'll need to disappoint the creator because I'm not going to put that amount of time into a game like that.Like I said at the start of this review, some people might be interested in trying this game out, and some people might like it; that's okay, I'm glad you enjoy the games you like, but I will be taking my time and playing something else.Thanks for reading my Review. Atratzu out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It is a small space shooter (...as in you shoot in space, not that you shoot spaces) with simple 3D graphics and a 3rd person ""behind the spacecraft"" view. The game controls using exclusively the keyboard with the arrows or the WASD keys and space or ctrl for shooting. The gameplay consists of series of levels where you have a single goal which is one of shooting enemies down, avoiding obstacles, shooting a specified number of enemies in a given time limit or taking down a big boss. When you are supposed to shoot down enemies you also get powerups, but those persist only in the level (as does your health, which resets after each level).Generally speaking, it isn't anything special to write home about, but it is a good ""time waster"" - especially considering the price. Personally i also really liked the background music.On the negative side, i'd say that the game becomes repetitive after a while (so it is only good for short bursts between other games or for your lunch break at work). Also i am not fan of saving only every few levels because of said repetition.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
