												Positives:If you're looking for a fun arcade style pool game that doesn't care too much about proper physics then this game is for you. The different cues remind me of RPG elements which is pretty interesting in a pool game. It revolves around leveling up, getting coins and tokens and just having a good time. It runs really well on pretty much any modern system. Even old potatos can probably run this game flawlessly. I didn't experience any bugs or glitches so far either. You can change the volume (or mute entirely) for the ingame music which I'm glad they added. The ranking system gives you something to work towards as you can ""prestige"" like in COD.Negatives:It seems way too focused on using a Xbox controller. I prefer mouse and keyboard for 2d-birds-eye-view pool games like this and there isn't much explanation as to what all of the controls are. The lack of different game modes also hurts the game. It needs more depth in that department. Currently the playerbase is small so it may be difficult to find a match online with other random players. Playing with friends on your Steam list doesn't even count as an actual online game which I think sucks. No stats count, no earnings, no random drops... nothing. There is also no way to chat with random players globally or even with your friends. You have to go into a steam group chat with a friend to talk and/or type while playing. That's very unfortunate. I feel like the community would be better, more active and an increased playerbase if people were at least able to communicate to each other while playing.Overall:For only 2 bucks you easily get what you pay for if this is your cup of tea. I still need more time playing to edit/update/revise my review but after about an hour and a half of playing this is what I gathered. Will update my review after playing it more.

												Lacks stuff that even games from the early 2000s had; can't even stroke the cue all the way back when breaking and english doesn't seem to work. In short, this isn't even a basic pool game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So nun nach mehr als 30 Stunden INGAME Zeit, überarbeite ich mal meine Review und spreche offen alle Vor- und Nachteile an. Beginnen wir erstmal mit meinem persönlichen Gesamteindruck.Ich habe lange Zeit auf ein einfaches und schlichtes Billard Spiel gehofft, auf STEAM natürlich. Hier geht es wirklich nur darum drauf los zu spielen, Sachen freizuschalten und Ende. Um Mal einen Vergleich zu nennen wäre dort Poolnation welches versucht mit Grafik zu Punkten, was in meinen Augen einfach nicht nötig ist für ein nettes kleines Pool Game, und das 8 Ball Pool Flash Game, welches Handy basierend ist und deswegen Millarden von Quests, Features und sonstigen Dingen hat.Das sind für mich negativ Punkte in den anderen Spielen und sind hier sehr gut weggelassen. Hier spielt man einfach entspannt ein Paar Partien und hat seinen Spaß einfach am Billard spielen. Allerdings könnte einem der Spaß etwas geraubt werden wenn man sieht dass es Cue's gibt die besser sind als Andere. Doch ich persönlich sehe auch hier kein Problem, denn wenn man halbwegs mit Verstand spielt kann man recht schnell einen netten kleinen Cue holen.Gekauft werden diese Cues von der Ingamewährung, welche ihr durch Quests, Free Crates (jeden Tag eine) oder durchs gewinnen im Quick Play + Tournament erhalten könnt. Dieses Spiel bietet also sehr wohl und recht gut die Möglichkeit es ohne Kostenaufwand gut zu spielen.Denke dass ich selbst ein gutes Beispiel dafür bin, da ich bisher 320.000 Coins erspielt habe und der ""beste und teuerste Cue"" gerade mal 60.000 kostet. Von daher sollte es jedem klar sein, dass man in diesem Spiel kein Geld investieren muss um gut zu sein.Die Steuerung ist recht simpel, mit der Maus wird durch Linksklick halten gesteuert und durch Rechtsklick zurückziehen gestoßen. Diese Steuerung ist wirklich recht angenehm wobei ich in Zukunft auf eine Nutzung der Tasten A+D für ein noch genaueres Aiming hoffe.Ein Knackpunkt hat dieses Spiel allerdings, die Schwarze (8) muss nicht in das gegenüber liegende Loch gestoßen werden, wie die letzte Kugel. dies macht viele Abschlüsse leider recht einfach, ansonsten alles in Allem ein traumhaft angenehmes Spiel und vorallem für 1,50-2.00 kann man sich hier wohl nicht sehr beschweren.-------------------------------------------------------------------------ENGLISH (Google Translator)So now more than 30 hours of INGAME time, I re-examine my review and speak openly all the advantages and disadvantages. Let's start with my personal impression.I have hoped for a simple  billiards game, on STEAM. Here it is really only about going to play, things to release and end. To give u differnt game names there would be Poolnation which tries to point with graphic, which in my opinion is simply not necessary for a nice small pool game, and the 8 Ball Pool Flash Game, which is mobile phone based and therefore billions of quests, features And other things.These are for me negative points in the other games and are here very well omitted. Here you simply play a few games and have fun playing billiards. However, one of the fun might be stolen if you see that there are cue's better than others. But I personally see also no problem, because if you half-minded plays you can quickly get a nice little cue.These cues are purchased from the Ingame currency, which you can get through Quests, Free Crates (every day one) or by winning in the Quick Play + Tournament. This game offers very well and quite well the possibility to play well without cost.Think that I am a good example, since I have so far get 320,000 coins and the ""best and most expensive cue"" costs just 60,000. Therefore, it should be clear to everyone that you do not have to invest money in this game to be good.The control is fairly straightforward, with the mouse is controlled by left-clicking hold and pushed back by right-clicking. This control is really quite enjoyable, which I hope in the future to use the keys A + D for an even more accurate aiming.A cracking point has this game, however, the black (8) does not have to be pushed into the opposite hole, like the last ball. This makes many qualifications unfortunately quite simple, apart from that all in all a fantastically pleasant game and especially for 1.50-2.00 you can not complain.			",38,13,2,5,2,1,3

												Good aiming was added, so ignore my old words down below about this great title.-------------------------------------------------------------------------Aiming properly is almost impossible without a feeling of being stressed or annoyed. Not enjoyable.			",103,32,4,7,7,2,4

												This game fully worth 2 Euros, just get it if you are into arcady 2D pool games like I was like around 2000-2010 on sites like POGO and GameSpy. Now Steam has this ""clone"" and I love it.I can easily see me spend 1000hours before the first year ends since this game released in April 2017.Now if we also gets 9ball this game would have endless gaming possibillity.OLD REVIEW before the developer took head and did what we (the community) wanted:This is hard for me but I have to down vote this game due to its aim system. Untill it gets a keyboard option to tap tap the last bit when aiming this will be a downvote, due to I am forced to reset the entire aim when I just want to tap tap a tiny little to the side with the aim = I am sometime forced to re-aim like 4 times during a time limit. No   just no I cant give this a thumb up untillllllllllll this is fixed.Other then this aim issue the game is good, but as said. Im getting super annoyed and I have lost games due to the game cheats me of sure victories with a DC and giving the opponent the turn althou I shott well within the timelimit.I will change this to a upvote once the tap tap keyboard aim is implemented.

Product received for free
												The amazing game with terrible physics. But is so well made why you didn't extend the game physics. I'm playing 8ball from Miniclicp from more that 7 years W.T>F , dude 8ball is a dinamic game, fast , unpredictable and real, your game 3/10 IGN. Is not late to tune up some stuff like:Faster time of shoting, I hate that slow animationI like is how is lock itself when right click isn't applied, but when I try to aim is terrible slow and Inaccurate Volvo Please fix!Is dead game ,isn't good thing for new realize, do some giveaway like you did in Keymailer.
