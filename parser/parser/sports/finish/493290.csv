								This is one of my daily VR games. The different events ensure something for everyone. The Sword & Shield and especially Boxing events are some of the most fun I have with my VIVE right now. The ability to create and manage multiple players is great.Something about the simplicity and challenge of punching orbs zipping at your face never seems to get old. Or smashing swords and orbs with a sword and shield while arrows rain down from above. Always challenging to top your own best score.  ",167,16,11,0,33,16,6

												I had friends coming over to try touch tonight so I got this game after watching the trailer, too much fun!!!  All my friends liked different games, but everyone agreed the boxing and lightsabre games were great.  I would pay full price just for those two games alone!  Graphics are kinda sad, but you don't even notice once you're playing.  We had fun trying to beat eachother's high scores and the world records, we all got to make our own avatars.  Can't wait to all get together and try again!  I recommend this game for sure.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Whether or not you are the solo tryhard-er attempting to set the VR world record or just a group of friends trying to have fun with a local party game, this game is the perfect game for them both!If you are a competitive person, you will love this game when you finally get your name on the global leaderboard after an hour of VR training. If you just wanna show your friends you are the VR Alpha Male, just host a local game and watch your friends get REKT. hahaha ",22,3,1,0,6,2,3

								So I gathered up 4 friends, load up SteamVR and start the World VR Competition. I had already tried the game by myself earlier so I knew that this could be a fun experience and competition between us. Everyone was enjoying the game a lot! Although I had some critique to do. My favorite game was by far the light saber one, cutting the balls shot at you is deff satisfying!! I was having a blast but then I realised I could no get near the top scores, and that's because you don't actually need to perform a cutting motion, just pointing the blade torwards the ball is enough and by doing this I was able to be in the top 5. I would actually prefer that everyone on the leaderboards were trying to cut the ball, so this would be really nice of an update. Still had tons of fun with it. It is as addicting as I thought it would be, I kept persuing the top 5 for each one of the games! :o) Once you finish a game, would be great to have the option to try again, rather than going back to start screen and having to select the game again.  :D			",68,20,6,3,19,4,3

												Awesome game! This is probably the best multi-mini game title I've played so far in virtual reality. This game shines most in group settings where friends can compete against one another. I unfortunately haven't been able to do that but it's still a fun game to play solo as there are leaderboards for each game. I've played VR games that only contain one of these types of games and that play worse. Defintely worth checking out, double definitely if you have friends to play with.My overview:

								this game is excellent its simplicity is the key to its brilliance i didnt like the gun reloading at all they should just be auto loaded boxing and laser swords are the best also sword and shield its just nutz i was trying to add to my world record score on easy lazer swords and i got to 607 and the balls just stopped coming and there was no way to end the level or record my new score other than that i love it ",256,39,8,12,42,12,12
