												Well, if you enjoy brick breaking games, you can't really go wrong with Duo. The first few levels are really slow and kind of boring, but the later levels get really intense with some nice power-ups and some pretty bad negative pickups, which can have you flailing your hands around like mad.A couple of downsides - The game has you confined to a very small circle, and if you move slightly outside of the circle it flashes up huge warning signs which are quite annoying. The paddles sometimes seem a little too large, meaning the game can be very easy once you get used to it. A difficulty option would nice.  Overall, would recommend to anyone looking for a brick breaker in VR.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a super fun game, like a retro arcade game except you're INSIDE the game world :) It's perfect for showing off the Vive to new friends and just having fun together without needing to become involved in a complex narrative or learning a lot of moves. Just block the balls and send them bouncing back toward the blocks! My only disappointment with the game so far is that my 6-year-old daughter can't play easily because the room size does not adapt itself to her height. UPDATE: I'm told the height issue has been fixed in the latest release, but unfortunately, I can no longer play at all. When the game starts, there's a red flash and then all I can see is an open world (no game objects) and my two ""shield"" controllers.			",18,15,1,3,12,1,5

												Loved Audioshield, Cyberpong, and Holoball, along with classic brick-breaker games, so I figured I'd give it a try, and expected to like it.There's way too much randomness to how the ball moves.  It doesn't feel like i'm intentionally trying to break the bricks, just like it's a byproduct of the ball somewhat randomly swirling around the play space.This is made worse by the ball movement around you--the ball kinda slows down and moves inward when it gets near you, which is distracting and annoying and contributes to an overall feeling that all you're doing is trying to block the ball from getting past you, and that you should ignore everything other than the balls that are directly in front of your play space.Also, I get blue and orange balls, and blue and orange paddles, but the two are seemingly unrelated, as far as I can tell?  I thought you'd be forced to block one with the other.  I'm not really sure I get it.Also, there's too much random crap flying around the screen.  Like, in addition to the blue and orange balls, there are the blue and orange balls which *spawn* the blue and orange balls? Also, if I run out of orange balls, I die.  Even though I'm still playing with a blue ball.  It's unexpected.			",181,60,4,9,10,4,12
