Early Access Review
Keep in mind, that I'm reviewing the current state of development.My ImpressionOriginally posted by FriendOfMine:I never thought this game would actually be so much fun!This pretty much sums it up. You will hear so much swearing, cheering and laughing playing this game the way it's supposed to be played - with your friends.TL;DRHere is my shortcut; the hole in one for this review.PositiveMediocreNegative+ Pretty maps~ not even a handful yet- Not optimized+ Different ways/paths to hit+ Custom Modifier- No Steam Integration~ The UI could use an overhaul+ Zooming in and out is possible- No free camera+ Relaxing Soundtrack~ some might find annoyingThe GameplayIt's Golfing - as easy as it gets - you hold the mouse button, move the mouse to change the strength and direction of your shot and release to hit the ball.You can also zoom in and out to get a better idea of the location of your goal, but sometimes it is obscured by obstacles so you won't be able to see where to hit at all - I really wish there was a free camera so you could inspect the level beforehand.The LevelsCurrently, there are 4 different levels: Forest, Desert, Moonlight Park, Spooky Mansion. An additional 2 are supposedly planned.Each map contains 18 holes and at least in the forest level you can finish it with 18 shots - but this will take you a lot of practice.The design is really neat and most of the time you can take more than one approach to hitting the ball.With to the many possibilities comes a big part of the replay value and the whole fun of the game. If you manage that one insane hit, none of your friends even thought about and you leave them wondering how you managed the hole in 2 strokes when they are on the 7th.MultiplayerCreating and joining a lobby is super easy, as well as setting up modifiers. Another big part of replaying this game will come from setting up different modifications - such as 'random ball shapes'. When the unlucky one with the acorn hits the hole in one - a♥♥♥♥♥♥storm will be unleashed :DHowever before even going into multiplayer, I advise you to paint your ball under 'Customize' - so you can be recognised by your friends. Just don't take the same colours.On the downside: you can't join a game through steam yet, which is a shame since you have to leaf through a few pages of games to find the one you are looking for.The VisualsAll the levels are really neatly designed and have a really cool air about them, to match a certain theme and bring you in the mood.The Forest, for example, is an all outside map, with a timber mill and saws and rolling logs around the place.The Desert features a pyramid theme with a sphinx and switches from an open-air level to an indoor level around the way.Moonlight Park is the currently only night level which has a really different feel from the other maps, it's quite magical.Last but not least in the mansion you will play all indoors and have ghosts spooking around as well as weird statues and trophies as well as cobwebs all over the place.However, in the current state of the game, some locations will just eat away your framerate - so you might have a look at your settings.The SoundI really like the sweet melody in the background, my friend, however, turned the volume way down because he couldn't stand it - so it's really a preference thing.The VerdictIf you have friends willing to play this game with you - by all means you can have a good time.However, there isn't that much content in the game yet. Of course, you can aim for the hole in one on every map (if this is even possible; I don't think it is), hone your skills by trying new hits and playing with funny settings but it depends on how long you and your friends will stay motivated together - because if the first one loses the interest, the others will probably follow.Also: always play with Collision - on. HateThank me later.Note:If you have read this far - thank you.I hope this review helped you in deciding to buy this game and if it did, I would be grateful for a 'thumbs up', if you didn't like it, you can give me a 'thumbs down' but I would be glad to hear your opinion on what you didn't like.

								Good, laid back game to play with friends.  It might be even better than real mini golf because I don't have to go outside with my pale skin and worry about awkward social interactions.  The different settings are fun to try and keep the game interesting, and the devs are always updating with new maps and fixing bugs.  Keep up the great work guys!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The game itself is really fun however the community of players is garbage, Good:The Devs of this game do a great job fixing problems, keeping people up to date, and adding new content. The game is actually really fun when your able to play and it's usually pretty stable for an early access game.Bad:The community. I understand the need to be able to kick a player due to ping problems or language however, this feature seems to get abused by hosts more often than used for its intended purposes. If you decide to join a random lobby instead of creating your own or playing with your friends, you better not be beating the host or you'll probably be kicked. Taking to long to line up your shots? You're probably gone. If you get somewhat good at the game (which you will because you'll learn the tricks to most holes) be prepaired to not finish games in random lobbies if you're beating the host.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Truly a remarkable mini golf game: It's in early access, so I wasn't surprised by the lack of maps (only 2 available). What I WAS surprised by, however, was both how smooth the gameplay is and how diverse the holes are. There is a colorful variety of custom options for the games, ranging from playing golf with cubes/eggs, to changing the gravity and changing how bouncy the balls are!I strongly recommend everyone to get this game if they have some friends that they can play it with, as I can see how it would get boring by yourself....just like real-life mini golf :>Cheers,-trippy			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								10/10 Golf with your Friends is honestly worthy of GOTY. Here's why;Music: The music is mind-blowing for lack of better words. It is capable of giving you a wide arrange of fealings from happiness to legitimate depression and agony. I would absolutely recommend turning it up to max as you enjoy/scream through your game of Mini-Golf with your friends. The composer has truely accomplished a feat with the one repeating song that plays throughout the entire game. Physics: The physics in this game are surprisingly realistic and fair. That is, unless you change them so you're on the moon. Which brings me to my next point.Options/Customization: Do you not like your white ball? Change it to hot pink! Not like that you can't collide with your friends? Make it so you can! Not like the gravity? Drag a bar and take a trip to Mars! Not like being in 3rd Person? Use the scroll wheel to go into 1st Person mode! I was actually surprised with the amount of things you could change in this game, which is actually cheaper than the average sandwhich. Use that logic to convince your friends to buy this game so you don't have to play it by yourself. Trust me, It worked for me.Overall Graphics: For an early access game this is top tier. Honestly. The screenshots aren't cutscenes, there actually aren't any cutscenes in this game, I mean it's mini-golf why would there be? All the screenshots are in game footage. Crazy huh?It's Balanced: All the courses in this game are very well balanced, which suprised me since this is a golfing game. (aside for the ones you can access by turning on beta content, those need some work. Like ffs the Twilight map is hard af) Blacklight Interactive has done something spectacular with this game and I cannot wait for the Bogey Boy DLC. Great work guys.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								Golf With Your Friends is a solid golf simulation game developed and published by Blacklight Interactive. Blacklight has three employees with two owners of which are brothers. The game itself is currently in Early Access, therefore, I will not harshly critique this review. The issues I will mentionI have placed in the forums for the developers to note down and fix in the future. The idea of this game is similar to real life golf, you complete levels whilst attempting to achieve the lowest score compared to your opponent in order to win. I really enjoyed this game and it was thanks to playing with friends, as the title suggests, because it creates competition between you and your friends and allows you all to have fun. The overall idea is simple, you play golf. The game features a lobby with recently-added filters to separate the password servers from the non-password servers. The filters feature is crucial to the matchmaking component of this game because as the title suggests, there are many more password-locked servers that are friends playing with friends instead of people playing with the community. You can play with up to 12 friends in multiplayer, adding a nice balance between friends playing and not over-doing it with friends per say. The three maps of Forest, Oasis, and the new map Twlight are all well designed. Forest is relatively basic but gradually increases in difficulty as the levels progress, which is beneficial to new players. Forest has a course surrounded by trees and it features some neat obstacles like spinning blades, rolling logs, and even targets that help you shoot towards the hole. Oasis is a level that is influenced by Egypt in its sandy landscape and it's pyramids with Holes within a pyramid. I like the level because it contrasts Forest and has water, thus it provides a difference with the maps. Furthermore, it's fairly difficult so I do like the challenge and map design of Oasis. Twlight is a standard golf course featuring different Holes. What makes it unique though is that it incorporates more water than Oasis and the course takes place at night, showcasing the luscious environment. Twlight allows you to step back and relax so you can enjoy the overall scenery. Twlight is my favourite course due to the night time and lights effect. Despite the small amount of features, the game has a clear direction with a simple concept and it delivers on that. Furthermore, the developers are absolutely excellent at communicating with the community on a daily basis if its informing them on direction, such as a roadmap, or responding to general queries. Blacklight is committed to this game and it shows in their work ethic because from when I purchased the game to now, the game has drastically improved and it feels more fluid than before. I played this on both my PC and my Macbook Air 2015 edition and there were differences in performance between both systems. My experience of this game on the Macbook was days after purchasing the game last month. Performance on it was choppy at best as the game lagged consistently despite my system surpassing the recommendations and despite me playing on low settings. My friend has a newer and more powerful Macbook Pro and he could play the game smoothly on medium settings and not on high. However, the performance on my PC has improved greatly since purchasing the game. At purchase, I played on high settings and in return my computer was loud, I wasn't able to sustain a stable FPS, and the game took up 16% of my CPU and up to 400mb of memory, per my task manager. Now, my computer does not run loud and I can sustain a solid 55-60FPS. Per my task manager, the game takes up 13% CPU and 350mb of memory and while not a great improvement, it is still an improvement nonetheless. Overall, while the game continues to perform better, much more improvement is needed.As I stated prior, the game features an abundance of issues. However, Blacklight have been effective at improving the game and removing bugs. And, I have made a regular contribution to the Golf With Your Friends forums on the issues I encountered as I do want to help them fix the game and succeed. At purchase, my main issues with the game were the physics and the lag that came with it. For instance, the majority of shots in courses would be overrun by lag and glitches in the physics of putting the ball. Currently, the game has made noticeable improvements in both areas but do occasionally occur.Overall, Golf With Your Friends is a solid Early Access title that is best played with friends to maximise your entertainment. It incorporates the simple feature of golf and this basic idea has been successful through the three well designed maps that are in different landscapes. It contains an excellent development team that listens to the community and wants to drastically improve this game. As with any Early Access title, it does have its fair share of bugs, but the development team has ironed out the main issues and is constantly improving this game with regular patches. This game is incredibly cheap at $5.99 and therefore if you have friends to play with I highly recommend this game because it's fun. If you intend to play solo, quite frankly it is your choice because it may get boring but at $6, nothing can go wrong.Note, for an Early Access title I won't do a ratings score.If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

With that said, I feel multiplayer in this game is rather lacking. Golf with your friends doesn't provide a dedicated matchmaking system. It does, however, grant you the option to create custom lobbies effortlessly.SummaryOverall, Golf With Your Friends is a solid game that is best played with others to maximize your entertainment. It contains an excellent development team that listens to the community and wants to improve the game drastically. The game is incredibly inexpensive at $5.99, and therefore if you have others to play with, I would highly recommend this game because it's quite enjoyable.

								10 hours of playing is not much but worth a review.As the title says 'with friends'. That's the most and only fun to play. If you host for random people they use guides to be the best and don't just have the fun, or kids who start raging and yelling if they can't win. It only has 4 levels.. for now. In january a new level will come out. And so will alot of other content (hopefully) in the future. These 4 levels are fun to play tho, there are alot of different courses.So..Play it with friends is really fun and I recommend that. But online.. nah, the community there is only wanting to win.

It is a quite fun mini-golf game with (currently) 4 courses that are pretty difficult.  You can change all sorts of characteristics in the game, such as ball color and shape, time per round, number of strokes and much more.  It is a load of fun to play with other people and even quite fun to play by yourself.  I've only played a few hours so far, but I see a lot of fun in my future.  Thanks for the great game!

Despite being one of the most boring sports in the world - in my opinion, of course - Golf With Your Friends manages to create a fun, entertaining, competitive, and challenging atmosphere for all to enjoy.Progress through a series of holes (waves) while keeping in my mind that you must clock in the least amount of strokes. Risk it all - just your friends that is - in this great little game that can be played with the whole family; what are you waiting for?!---------------------------------------------------------Pros+ Believable physics+ Collisions with friends!+ Multiplayer mode is always great!+ Tons of customisation options available+ Different maps offer various amounts of challenges+ Manages to make golfing fun, and that's hard for someone like me+ Cheesy music that doesn't take away from the overall gameplay in any way+ Simple gameplay and very easy to play/understand (no crazy interafaces or controls to master)+ Ability to customise your golf ball: choose from many options in order to stand out from your friends+ Great price for the amount of content it currently offers (I picked it up at $4,79 on Steam); I would consider it a steal since you will be receiving more content later on in the future+ Active community = best news for a gamer (according to SteamCharts, there are 1,055 players playing now, with an all-time peak of 2,011. As this game continues to grow, I definitely see it becoming one of those games that people must have)Neutral± Ability to be competitive, but you risk your friendships should you emerge victorious± Some feautures that I think will be great but are not yet released: level editor and in-game currency that can be spent to customise your profile further. Will update this review when those are releasedCons- No controller support- Camera view spazzes out at times and this can get a bit annoying, especially when you're shooting and you get ""locked in"" to a bad angle- If you're prone to seizures, then be careful on the Oasis map. I think it's the 7th hole (I can't recall), but my golf ball got stuck underneath a pipe and my screen started spazzing out- Hard to get into a game with friends at the moment. The developer's said that they would work on this feature, but for now, it's annoying having to go through pages of lobby room's in order to find the one you want to join- Would be cool if the ball's could interact. Okay, this just sounds wrong, but what I mean is that if I were to hit my golf ball a certain way as my friend, then they would bounce off one another. This would increase the competitive value of the game by a lot I have been informed otherwise (thanks to Ian07)!---------------------------------------------------------This game is in Early Access mode, but seems quite well rounded for the amount of product offered. The company, Blacklight Interactive is made up of 3 people who appear to be truly dedicated to the game. It doesn't get any better than that.If you have a few bucks to spare, I definitely recommend this title. While you will have some raging moments, ultimately, you will have great memories with friends overall (and with new ones that you will make along the way). Give this game a try: you really won't regret it!Overall8.5/10---------------------------------------------------------Like my review or have any questions? Then please consider joining my review group, the Sonny Report! I will keep it up to date with the games that I plan on reviewing and will also accept suggestions.Whilst not a video review, if you would like to watch gameplay of Golf With Your Friends, then you can check mines out here.

								UPDATE: They have changed the name to Golf With Your Friends, due to what i believe to be a copyright issuea, as expected the flamers have started up already. Please note that the name change does not affect how the game plays. fs.First of all, with only 2 courses, this game ranks in my top 5 for price paid per hour of gameplay at 0.41c per hour, compared to rocket league (058.c) Euro Truck Sim 2 (0.63c) Civ 5 (1.24$) etc. for the amount of gameplay you get, its so worth the money.This is the best mini golf game on steam already, only 3 months in to EA.The two man dev team are passionately active on the forums, always taking into consideration what the community would like to see, they patch and fix bugs within hours (Most of the time) and are working really hard to make GWF a game that the community wants.As for the gameplay, its terribly easy to point your aim and take a shot, but the difficulty comes from choosing the right power and path to the hole. If you play in a big enough lobby there is bound to be someone who is great at the game, who will be more than willing to teach you a trick or two!With workshop support and new maps/reward system and skins coming soon you'll want to get on board straight away!All in all a great little time consuming, semi-competitive mini golf game with boundless creativity that shows great promise if (like the community believes) the developers stay as passionate as they are already.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is a very fun game to play with friends. It is definitely worth it for the low price tag even though there is not much content at the moment (more is on the way). MapsThe two maps that currently come with the game are very replayable and I have not noticed many bugs in them at all so far. One of them is called Forest and the other Oasis. At the moment Forest contains less bugs than Oasis which contains a few minor ones. MultiplayerThe mulitplayer lacks players but it is very easy to create your own server and you can play with up to 12 people. Joining servers is not as easy though as you have to go through a list of about 12 pages. A search tool would make this much easier. CustomisationCustomisation is also available in the game with the ability to change the colour of the ball. As well as this, you can customise your server settings to change the way you play the game. For example, you can change the shape of the balls to eggs and add an ability to jump whilst playing. Graphics 7/10Replayability 9/10Bugs 7/10Multiplayer 8/10Overall 7.75/10In my opinion this game is definitely worth a try and I think it is the best mini golf game out there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Surpsingly this is a pretty fun game, especially with friends. I thought it would contain typical mini golf maps but it's a lot more creative/unique than that. I never knew how intense a game of golf with friends could be until I played this. The game makes things a lot more interesting by adding custom settings, such as changing the shape of the ball, or decreasing gravity. I would definitely recommend this game. There are a few bugs here and there but nothing game changing. Unfortunately the only thing I can say that's negative is that it's not really worth $6 for only 4 maps and this game unexpectedly makes my computer very loud for a simple golf game. I understand that it's an early access game and so, I look forward to the many additions the developers will bring to the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Golf With Your FriendsNote: Each field is weighted differently, and thus affects the overall score differently.  Field Rating Review   Graphics 7 Nothing spectacular, but this is a mini-golf game we're talking about here. It gets the job done rather well.   Gameplay 8 You would think mini-golf could only go so far with its options. Oh how wrong you would be. Lower gravity, increase bounce, change the ball shape (cube, triangle, etc), turn on collision, and more. Though there are currently only three courses, expect many more, and in the mean time enjoy what there is to offer. A couple downsides to the current gameplay: It can be quite glitchy at times, particular when trying to putt into the hole. The method for hitting the ball could also use some work, as it occasionally triggers false-positives and you hit the ball when you didn't mean to.   Story N/A Just the ridiculous moments you'll laugh about over and over with friends.   Multiplayer 10 It has been a couple years since a game made me laugh this hard, this consistently, while playing with my friends. From watching them fail easy shots in hilarious ways, to hearing them cry out as their ball flies off the course, you'll find plenty of good times in this simple mini-golf game. The laughs kick up a notch once low-gravity and high bounce are enabled.   Replayability 7 In its current state, there aren't quite enough levels to keep you occupied for a significantly long period of time. But what is there will keep you coming back to try different modes with various friends.   Overall 7.8/10 With the promise of more to come, Golf With Your Friends already has a fantastic start. With three levels that have 18 holes each, and a surprisingly amount of customization in gameplay, it is the best mini-golf game I have encountered yet. For the price range, highly recommended if you want a few nights of laughs with your friends.

								If you dig mini golf, you'll like this game.Pros:- The multiplayer works very well. Finding a game to join is no problem.- It performs well. I haven't experienced any performance issues at any time.- The graphics are pretty good for a mini golf game.- The controls are easy to learn and precise.- Wacky options like being able to make everyone have to use a cube instead of a ball make things interesting.Cons:- I wish there were more courses to choose from.In summary this is a fun little game that does exactly as it advertises. It's easy for you and a few friends to jump into a game and play some put-put.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Played this game in full 12 player lobbies where we were all on voice comms together. Mini golf with friends, as you'd expect, is a hillarious and great time. The game's price tag ($6) is a good price, especially when more courses/modes get added. You can also join open lobbies and play golf with strangers on the internet; this is a game that should be played with other people.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Seems too simple to be fun. Don't wait for a sale, just buy it. Happy to pay $10 to be honest. Let's start with the music. Listen to the other reviews because it is true....ok moving on.At the moment there is Classic mode, which is stock standard mini golf, and there is Custom, which introduces cylinders, pyramids, cubes, and more. Low gravity, bouncy ground, and the friendship destroyer, collision. Luckily I am yet to play this with my friends! The community is great too. Of course it's not perfect, but it's still awesome.8/10When more game modes are added? 10/10EDIT: Two awesome new maps? Good enough for me.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Golf with your friends is one of the best, if not the best, mini golf game you can find here on Steam (and most places for that matter). It's pretty self-explained what the game is about, you play golf, with or without your friends. (Though playing with friends will give you an overall better experience, and if not, you need new friends).The game currently has four maps with a fifth one on the horizon, all of which has a different theme, you got your standard green forest type of map, a map set in the ancient Egypt, a map taking place in a enchanted magical forest, one in a haunted mansion and the fifth and upcoming one (as of this review) will feature a candyland sort of theme from my knowledge.The game does get somewhat repetitive after a few hours of gameplay once you figure out how every hole works and how to do well on them. This is a problem especially if you're playing multiplayer with strangers, and certain friends (Damn it Carl) since there is a handful of guides on Steam explaining how to get a hole-in-one or the best possible score on each hole, so more often than not you will play against someone who has memorized all the holes or just simply looking at a guide as they play.But there are a few settings you can play around with to spice things up incase you get bored such as: bigger golf balls, enable jumping (which makes the game way easier but is really enjoyable at the same time), enable gravity and so on.I haven't experienced any game-breaking bugs myself but the game is in Early Access so chances are there are a few bugs and glitches here and there that needs to be eliminated, aswell as more content being added in the future.For $6 this game is defenitely worth picking up, and you're able to get it for less during sales. And since it's not very expensive you can most likely talk some friends into buying it, or perhaps you can be generous and gift a copy to them. Very fun and enjoyable game to play casually!

YouTube™ Video: Golf with your Friends Preview (Steam/PC) 

			Views: 691		

			In this video, we show a preview of the upcoming game ‘Golf with your Friends’ for Steam. Video was Recorded and Voiced by The Hidden Levels one and only Manic Ado.		

Golf with friends is a mini-golf game in which revolves around playing online against other people. You can play single player for now but they soon plan to add in AI Enemies. I feel this game has a super amount of potential and will be very fun. Positives:+ Music - Awesome soundtrack which makes me happy+ Variety - The golf courses are real fun to play, they plan to add 6 in total but only have two on there for now. + Very cheap price – For the price of the game I feel it’s most definitely worth it. Even with just these two courses.Negatives:- Not a lot of content yet (but that’s obvious as it’s in Early Access and runs risk of never being completed)- There is no real set difficulties to the courses. Would be nice for an Easy Course, Medium Course and Very Hard course instead of progressive which I get stuck on towards the end. I’m a novice! ;)- The game gets a bit rugged in the desert area and doesn’t run as smooth as the grasslands.I had a refreshing time playing Golf with Friends, my only regret is that I have no friends. (joke) I didn’t manage to test out the online section which would probably increase the games fun tenfold. I highly enjoyed single  player and practising on the courses which progressed from Easy to real difficult. I definitely recommend a purchase though and highly believe in the developers with following through, they are super friendly people and we talk often! We will see in time though! :) I believe in them!Score: Buy Now ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Is there anything more sublime than a round of minigolf with your buddies? Some of my fondest childhood memories were of birthday parties at the putt-putt course, and even as an adult I sometimes cajole my co-workers into a round or two. Like the name suggests, Golf With Your Friends aims to capture that same simple joy, and does so with admittedly very few frills thus far.At the moment there are three courses to choose from, Forest, Oasis, and Twilight, at 18 holes apiece. Forest hews closest to what you remember of minigolf, with the classic windmill, Plinko drop, and river jump holes. Oasis is an Egyptian-themed course with longer, more elaborate holes that cross over and send the ball flying through the clear desert sky. Twilight is by far the hardest course, with unforgiving ramps and pits that might require half a dozen or more strokes to get just right.Navigating these courses is as easy as click, drag, and release. Your mouse aims your shot and you pull back to fill the four-part power bar, which gives you a wide range of control over the ball. Everything from feather-light taps to line drives are possible, and the holes you encounter will require them all. There's definitely a learning curve to the courses but most of the challenge is in learning just the right finesse to put on the ball to overcome the traps. I was coming close to par on all three courses after a single practice game on each, and I don't consider myself a putt-putt savant.The interface is simple enough to get you into a game almost immediately. Since this golf is intended to be enjoyed with (your) friends, every game is set up as a hosted server. Choosing to join gives you a handy browser with all the filters you could want, and hosting plops you down with name, password, and custom game options. One nice touch is that the lobby itself is a practice hole where you can putt around different obstacles while waiting for the match proper.Admittedly, three courses is not a lot to run with but the custom game options I mentioned give the game plenty more lasting power. You can switch on ball collisions with other players, low gravity mode, optional ball jumping, and even non-spherical balls. Custom games were popular from what I've seen among the thousand or so people playing at any given time, so be prepared for anything when you join a server. The player base seems pretty chill as well and it's always easy to find a match, even if it's not necessarily the course or options I might want at the moment.The graphics are serviceable but nothing spectacular, and the sound design is basic effects under some pleasantly peppy music. Obviously you're going to have more fun if you have the titular Your Friends to play with, but even going in solo there's plenty of fun to be had. Even in its early state, Golf With Your Friends contains enough simple fun to make it worth your time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Golf With Your Friends is exactly what you would expect from the title: Play some miniature golf!  Invite your friends!The music is relaxing, the sound effects are genuine, and the game has been a light-hearted laugh across voice with friends.  I cannot recall the last time I enjoyed such an innocent experience in a multiplayer game.  It's fantastic and rest assured that the developers are active and working hard to add more features and optimise old ones all the time.Now, I'm writing this during Early Access where there may be bugs and physics issues, but if there are, I have not encountered any of them in my seven hours of play.  That may seem like a small sample size, but it represents twenty or so total full plays across the game's current four courses.  As it is, it feels already in a state every bit worth the five-dollar price tag.  Go golf with your friends!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I recieved this game as a joke gift. Y'know, one of those games that you play with friends because they're bad. After playing it for five minutes we all quickly realized that this game was genuinally fun and brought a lot of laughter.The art style is vibrant and pretty to look at, and the courses are extremely unique and fun to play. There needs to be more music in future updates, as it can be a little maddening, but it is currently in Early Access so that's excusable. It's honestly ridiculous, how a mini golf game can be this fun. I can see myself and my friends playing this consistently whenever it updates. Would highly reconmend to anyone who has a friend to play this with!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

My friend gifted me this game, and I LOVE IT!!!!DISCLAIMER: THIS GAME IS SUPER DUPER EARLY ACCESSFirst of all, I dislike golfing. But this game...just makes golfing fun. I love this game so much. I think if you are looking for games to buy on Steam, this should be one of them. My favorite part of the game is the water. When you hit your golf ball in the water it has this little raft that connects to it and you can jump all over the place. SUPER FUN. Yet I would love more maps, there are only 3 so far...and it would be fun with more maps. I've already mastered the 3 maps. The bugs in the game don't much bother me, i've only crashed once and I actually have only seen 2 bugs. 1 is a texture bug, a small texture was glitching. I restarted my game and it was fine again. 2 is I've only crashed once.But other than that, the game is super duper fun. BUY IT!Overall rating: 9.5/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Golf with your Friends is an incredibly fun little game. The courses are creatively designed, challenging, aesthetically pleasing, and fun to play. The game currently has four 18-hole courses with two more expected to be developed before GwyF leaves Early Access. There are plenty of modifiers to increase the replayabilitly, especially when playing with friends, such as ball shape, ball size, gravity, bounciness, and collisions. Playing with the feature to jump the ball at will drastically changes how the courses need to be played.I can't really comment on playing the game solo, since I always play with friends, but it's a blast to play with a group over voice chat. GwyF has a text chat in-game if you cannot voice chat.GwyF is still in Early Access, and as such, has its share of issues. There are various bugs on some of the courses that involve clipping, going out of bounds, or getting stuck, especially when playing with different ball shapes; however, the devs have been keen on making sure those bugs are corrected. The spectator mode needs work. Some of the holes are flat-unplayable with certain ball shapes. It can also be somewhat of a pain to find your friends' lobby since there's no feature to invite from Steam. Most of these issues aren't necessarily game-breaking, and they normally come out to be hilarious and quirky at best, and mildly irritating at worst.All in all, GwyF is well worth its low price. It's simple, well designed, fun, and has a good amount of content, with more on the way.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Essentially this game is as it says, ""Golf With Friends"". After some updates have been made to the game, I can now recommend it. The price-tag isn't all too steep at $6 and for essentially a two-man development team, they have quite progressed since my initial review.Think of it as not ""Golf"" per-say, but Mini-Golf. It has two main areas which are the Forest and Oasis. Both have many holes to play through and they aren't as buggy as when I first started playing.You can do custom settings like higher gravity, different types of balls(easter egg, sphere, isosphere, etc.), and some other misc. settings like collision.Some future maps are coming up, some party games, and some more additional stuff so it's worth investing and supporting the developers in the early stages. There isn't a whole lot of content yet, but a lot is coming.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								There are some bugs, but that's what early access is all about right? The devs are very active in fixing errors and advancing the game. Currently it has 2 18-hole courses and they are extremely fun even when you get early-accessed. There are so many game options that it keeps the game entertaining. You can be eggs, cubes, cylinders, etc and you can have super bouncy floors with half gravity. What more could you want besides more courses in the future?Should you get this game? Absolutely!Want to end friendships?Turn on collision and crank up the stroke limit!This game is without a doubt worth every penny you pay for it. Even though it's in early access, it runs very smoothly and it's very popular with a large group of my friends. I can't wait to see what they add to the game next9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The first game I played, I got completly destroyed by my friends (they played it for a couple of hours before I bought it). With every game that I played I got better and better and even beat my friends and finished first. If you use custom settings, this game can make to rage very hard (I'm looking at you 'Cone'). There are still some features that need to be added and bugs that need to be removed, but it is an early access games so that's only logical. If you have a couple of friends than this is an amazing and fun game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is a very quirky fun take on mini-golf that you play with your friends, strangers or even by your lonesome (trying to figure out the hole-in-one strats, you know who you are.) Currently has 2 courses available with more planned on the way, a few quirky modes currently on the experimental version and possibly some of the best devs I've experienced despite only being a 2 man team. They are very active on updates and have a roadmap in the forums if you want to see where they plan on taking it. They are very friendly and active on the forums and is taking community ideas and advice to make the game even better while also adding more to it in a fast enough manner.I highly recommend this to someone who wants a game that is more casual but has the options to make it a stressful race to the hole against others. There are plenty of Youtubers that have videos on it though they might be dated because of the constant tweaks by the devs but you can get an idea of what you'd be getting into from the videos, still though I think it's worth the price in it's current version with only 2 courses so when everything else eventually comes out it'll be more than cost efficient! :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Not gonna lie, I was gifted this game to review, and I had very little expectations since every mini-golf style game I've played on either mobile, or on pc has always been rather dull and uninspiring.This game isn't honestly like that at all. Even in it's current state, it has two very complete and awesome levels, that are extremely unique as far as design goes, and more levels on the way. From my conversations with the devs, they are very open minded about ideas and are constantly working to add new content and various other things. I'm really excited to see where this game goes, I had a blast streaming it tonight and getting my butt handed to me by my girl friend.Really recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Having lots of fun playing this game. It's a great throwback to the flash minigolf games i would spend ages playing as a kid. Very similar to the Gmod towers golf which is also very fun. The holes are a good challenge and are designed very well. The physics/mechanics feel great as well. For 5-6 bucks its a great deal for the 2 current courses. Can not wait till more courses are added and my friends pick up the game! Great work devs!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is a good time waster with some buddies if youre taking a break from something else and it is also a game you can spend a whole night playing and talking trash with your pals. THE ONLY DRAWBACK IS THE (CURRENT) LACK OF CONTENT AND NEW STUFF IS COMING OUT FREQUENTLY. This game (when finished) will be worth more than 6 dollars so buy it now and watch this game grow into something special.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I bought Golf with friends because it was inexpensive and looked like a great game for relaxing and having a good time and am surprised how fun and vibrant it is! I played through both courses twice with a friend and am still looking forward to hopping on later again because I had a blast! I really love how you can change the golf ball into things like an egg or a cube, and how you can change gravity and bounciness because we had lots of laughs playing with derpy combinations of ball shapes and physics. I liked it so much I bought Golf with friends for two more friends. I'm very much looking forward to new content to come!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								actually very fun. the mods are fun too. I like the fact that you dont have to wait for everyone to shoot - you all get to shoot at the same time - like an orgy I would assume. I give this a 5 outa 5 because I can smoke a joint with one hand and game with the other. The music is upbeat and somehow not annoying. When it cut out I missed it. The holes are huge. Again I assume also like an orgy. So its not hard to sink your balls if you know where Im going with this. Highly recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Decent fun, reminiscent of the old top-down mini golf flash games we all played in middle school during computer lab. Graphics look great. Needs some more gameplay options, which I'm sure that the developers are working on. Turn-based would add more pressure to each shot, for example. $6 is more than worth it for the fun you're going to get out of the two 18-hole courses (a forest and an egyptian temple-themed one). Perhaps I'm greedy, but I want more! I'll happily shell out a few more bucks if need be for some DLC courses; just don't get carried away! Awesome little time killer and a game that any kind of friend can enjoy with you. 8/10 as of early access. More modes, possibly more courses as well plz!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

An abomination, The physical form of RNGesus himself. You must offer a sacrifice to win his favor, may it be hitting an opponent off the course, or perhaps your own sanity. Anything goes, might be a simple shot. Until RNGesus says ""Naw bro not feeling it."" And if theres low gravity? Forget ever hoping on getting near the hole.

								Golf with friends is a thrilling adventure in the dynamic genre of competitive mini - golf gaming.  It offers many opportunities to customize the gaming experience such as a dynamic range of ball color selections and endless options for colorful room naming. The in game chat features encourages the play to cheer your opponent on and celebrate great shots in a supportive community environment.  I find it easy to join a public game during times that my friends are unavailable--thus giving me the opportunity to make new friends with whom to share this exhilarating golfing experience.  I cannot recommend this game more highly for those who value beautifully designed games of skill within a fun and relaxing community environment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Absolutely fun game and an all around chill experience that is a great refresher. Is a fantastic game to play with friends, particularly as a drinking party game. In my opinion, the game is much less enjoyable by yourself and as the title suggests it is meant to be played with others. Granted that the game is in early access, I've run into a solid amount of bugs and complete game crashes. The last hole of the Oasis course is almost completely luck based and needs to be tweaked, but otherwise is a very balanced, relaxed, skill based game.Absolutely worth $5, you won't regret it.

								I made my friends so mad they stopped talking to me.10/10 would buy again.Serious review though, this game is great with friends. Honestly, the 20 minutes I spent playing this game were some of the most fun I've had playing a multiplayer game. It has two very well made levels at this time of development, but is seriously lacking content. As it's early access, I can completely forgive it for that. I really hope that the developers add in new levels soon, or at the least open up a level editor and make a steam workshop section. As soon as they do that, this game will be my favorite multiplayer game.Get this game, and buy a few copies for your friends. You will not regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Seriously, buy this game. It's so much more fun than I expected it to be, and I had super high hopes as it was because it's Minigolf and I really like minigolf. It has it's fair share of bugs, but that's to be expected from an early access game.For a fun time, put on 0.25x gravity and enable jumping. We've dubbed it moon golf.EDIT: The new Haunted House map is amazing, and super refreshing, as hole in one strategies aren't as obvious or readily available. Definitely play it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Great game. I think the title alone will help you decide if you'll like it. Do you want to golf with your friends?? Well if that sounds good, you should probably enjoy it. The Level design here has its flaws at times, (mainly with holes that forces you to hit your ball off walls, like the pillars in egypt or the bottle in the mansion) but it is for the most part quite forgiving and interesting. It's great for a large group of friends of all skill levels. The controls themselves are incredibly simple but very well made. Simply click and drag where you want to go and how hard you want to hit it. There's a power bar that easily indicates how hard or soft you'll be hitting. It gets the job done efficiently, and I appreciate that. Surprisingly, it is also got a great amount of replay ability. Coming back to maps you did and turning on jump can really change the entire game. It's broken, but it's fun. And if you really want to make things hectic, you can change the gravity, change the ball shape to all sorts of horrible things (Eggs, cones, stars, cubes, etc) which all completely change how the holes work. Luckily, they're still almost all doable! I really enjoy this game for its simplicity. It's what you'd expect from a mini golf game. I wouldn't recommend it unless you bring a few friends along, however. The single player is nice, but would probably get stale. Only real gripes right now are that I wish there were more levels and possibly a VERY easy to use level editor that lets you pick community levels on the fly (similar to how SpeedRunners does it). Obviously, though, there's more planned for the game, but you can never be sure when it comes to Early Access. Even though there's only a handful of maps, I'd strongly recommend this game with friends, especially since the price is quite affordable as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game is fun, I mean, it's mini golf with your online friends. While the concept is great, there just isn't enough content here right now. I would gladly pay 20 bucks for a mini golf game with a lot more content. They only have plans for 6 courses total, and if that's the case, I hope they allow custom courses via the Workshop. For 6 bucks, it's worth it, but I sincerely hope more content is added.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I've had more time to play now so I can give a more thorough review.TLDR: Amazing game to play with friends at a great low price.Pros:Each course lasts around a half hour, so your games aren't dragged out.Simple controls. All you have to do is hold the left click and pull back the mouse.Runs great on most computersThere's a ton more pros but you guys get the idea.Cons:Not a lot of players. Game came out Janurary 30th and didn't get featured on the front page of Steam, so it might be awhile before the playerbase gets heavier.Only two courses, 18 holes each. They are currently working on some other courses and the potential of a content creator added.Some glitches. Just about all non game breaking.---As you can see there are tons of reasons to by this game, the big one being it's not like other horrible early access games that are just buggy messes. It's $6, definitely worth it.Make sure to check out the subreddit!https://www.reddit.com/r/GolfWithFriendsGame ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Still one of the few best Indie / early access games out there to play with a full party of 5 or 6 friends. The only problem I have with this game is that you can't ivite friends to a lobby, so your friends have to find your lobby. Other than that this game makes a game of digital mini golf fun despite only having 3 maps so far it's still a good game to purchase, I mean I did purchase 5 copies. What I did durring the Steam Summer Sale. The price even not sale is still worth every cent that you have cause it's a differnet unique game. Oh did I mention you can also have cubes, cones, hockey pucks and more 3D solids than just gold balls.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Totally awesome game for stupidly cheap fun!Graphics: The graphics are not amazing.  Seriously they are basic and offer nothing amazing, but graphics do not make  a game enjoyable and for this game, the graphics are decent enough to not be bothered by!Audio:  The audio again is simple.  It is mini golf but has some kinda annoying music, which you just turn off but for the sound itself it again is nothing enjoyable.  Just basic.Controls: The controls are simple mouse to use, so easy you learn the game on the first few seconds and cannot complain about it at all.Gameplay: The gameplay is mini golf basically... What do you want? You can turn normal minigolf into some insane fun with friends... Up too 12 people might I add and there are several options you can change in the modes options to make the game even more enjoyable, which range from low low gravity, different balls like egg shape, cube shape, cyclinder shape and so on, so mix all these together and you've got a lot of fun going for you!Right now as I write this review, there are only 3 zones and each zone contains roughly 19 holes each.  Sadly, you can do these in under an hour, depending on the settings you have! Still the game is insanely cheap and will be getting a lot of work and more content in the mix and for that, I would highly highly recommend the game!So yes, go and buy! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Fun game - but a note to the dev's Sometimes the ball gets caught ontop of wood, and it doesnt register that it's stuck.... Outside of that - it needs more maps for sure, a little more on the generic side of flat platforms, but there are some bouncing areas, and ramps which make it fun, and challenging.I can see this being an awesome game for friends, soon as it's bugs are worked out and more implimented into it. I liked it the first time I played it on stream.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game is actually one of the best games I have played. It is still in it's early stages but already has got me addicted. With multiple strategies this game has very little repetitiveness even while it currently only has two courses. I can't wait for future updates. Trust me this game is for sure worth the money.

								The controls are easy, the courses not so much.  If you get this get it for a friend as well.  There are only 2 levels as I write this review and only one game mode.  Some of the level design is really fun though and we laughed it up quite a bit.  I hope that eventually there are more levels, different music tracks per themed course and hopefully we get a level editor.  This game would really really shine with a level editor.

								I super fun golf game, and let me tell you, if you get like 2-3 of your good friends together and play this, you will have a jolly good time! I absolutely love this game and I've only played an hours worth. The courses offer a bit of difficulty that requires you to time your shots right and use your pro strats. It would be really nice if that added more than 6 levels once it's done because you can play through the levels fairly quickly. The other downside is that the balls appear to ""lag"" when you are spectating and there are also a few spots on different holes where the ball can get stuck and there is no way to get it unstuck.All in all. A really fun game that I would definently recommend buying if you have an extra $6.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Basically, if you've got some friends, you'll probably get the most fun out of this game, even if there's only 2 courses available right now. Theres a few custom options to keep the game interesting, different golf ball shapes, altering gravity, jumping, and how bouncy the ground is, to name a few. If you play with the original options, you most likely won't run into any game breaking bugs, however some of the options when customized, may lead to a few holes that are extremely hard. Runs smooth on an Intel HD 4400 integrated gpu on low, at least, smooth enough for me to be able to enjoy it. If you dont have friends, there's still enough games on around 7-9 pm EST in the NA region, I can't say I've seen the list empty, however I usually get on later in the day to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								There is nothing wrong with this game, but it's not a great game either. It's fun to play through all the courses with a friend, but that's where it ends for me personally. There is no replayability here whatsoever; no scores, no unlockables, no leveling. I wish there was something to bring me back to this game, but if you played through it once you pretty much saw the entire game. Such a shame.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								""My mum always said life is better with friends. I didn't believe her. Now I wish I had more friends.""Golf and Early access, for most, will turn you away. However the real kicker in this title is ""with your friends"" if you've made any up to this point in your life. This game will wish you had. IT is purely a social experienced that is there to kill a bit of time, record something stupid and love every second. There will be disbelief and rage amongst chaos and humor.Golf, well... it's golf. Think putt-putt in a blender. Can be slow on standard, or hectic with different shaped balls or even cubes and that is not mentioning the jumping.Early access. The game holds up well with it's biggest flaw being a lack of content. When I purchased it, there were only three different ""maps"" that housed a full course of 18 holes. To my knowledge now, there is 4 maps. I would say there really need to be a significant jump in content before I call it a completed game.Overall I would vote it a 7/10 for what it is, an early access golf game. To be honest when a mate said buy it I was skeptical. It will serve you well with friends and bore you to death alone and I can't wait for more conent.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The number of levels the developers are making (6) is a little on the low side, I'd prefer to see more holes with their existing themes rather than divert time and resources into new themes and new graphical assets.I'd easily recommend a buy provided the level editor is successfully implemented, as the player base will need to beef up the number of courses there are.

								This game is alot of fun, even more fun when playing it with friends. Graphically, it is impressive, with a lot of nice textures. Gameplay is good, definitely room to improve on some mechanics, but I see a lot of potential for this game. Current content amount is a bit sparse, but more are coming. I am looking forward to seeing a lot more levels and the level editor.

Early Access Review
								At the time of writing, Golf With Your Friends is still in Early Access, but having been on the market since January 30th, I’m pretty comfortable in my assumption that nothing ground-breaking is going to come out of the game, and that it’s at a point where GWYF can be reviewed for the long-term.Golf With Your Friends is one of those stunningly aptly named games that despite its simplicity, still manages to imbue the game with a sense of fun before you even get to playing it. I’m really lucky when it comes to reviewing this game, because the 8-Bit Preppers crew all grabbed a copy one night to play together, and I feel as though that initial session really let GWYF show us exactly what it was all about. There were tears of laughter, no small amount of sledging, and cries of “♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t” as we played through the three maps that were available. It was an excellent initial experience, and we have managed to wring a few more sessions out of it by changing the physics options, and by joining public games, but in the end GWYF faces the same dilemma that many early access multiplayers face: Content.In the ten months since its release, Blacklight Interactive has added one extra course to Golf With Your Friends. One. It fills me with disappointment to think of how popular this game could have been upon release if it had more courses, or if more courses were released in a timely manner over the duration of the Early Access period. Like most simple games of skill, GWYF has the potential to be one of those excellent casual games that never gets uninstalled. There are great variations in the four courses that are available at this stage, and I am genuinely interested to see what the next two courses that are scheduled for release in the “full game” will look like. I am, however, pretty sceptical that they will be released before mid 2017, considering the fourth map took so long to release. If Blacklight Interactive really wanted to ensure the longevity of GWYF, release of a level editor with the full game would go a long way towards that.I have to admit that on a fundamental level I still think that releasing games before they are finished is an affront to consumers, but at the same time I can also appreciate its benefits for fledgling Developers like Blacklight Interactive. The good news is that in Golf With Your Friends, they have set very reasonable targets for what is going to be included in the full game. I just wonder if without a level editor or something that adds value and replayability, whether this will just be another casual multiplayer picked up on sale for the majority of consumers. My advice is to plan a game session with your mates, and milk every bit of enjoyment you can from that initial gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game is awesome! At first glance I didn't want this game because I don't like golf but playing this game with my friends proved me wrong. This game is fantastic with friends, we've all had hours of fun in this game and it's all from our own stupidity, one friend is a try hard and it's fun trying to beat him and then another friend does crazy random♥♥♥♥♥♥by jumping all over the map and still somehow getting it in.Overall I recommend this game because it's an awesome game to chill with and just to calm down after cancerous games of dota/similar games.9/10Not 10/10 because the maps do get boring over time but I know the devs are working on a new map ATM and they're creating a map editor for people to use.My friend did buy this game for me but it's so good i'd buy it again just to support the devs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Well, I bought this game thinking, ""Hmmmm, online mini golf for 6 bucks? Not a bad deal."" Ohhhhh what a mistake that was. This game has driven me to insanity, who knew a game of mini golf could make you want to hurt someone who lives across the planet and give you PTSD every time you try and eat an ice cream CONE. Stupid cone. When all the modifiers are off, the game can be enjoyable, but when they're on all hell breaks loose. I know it's in alpha but the game is quite buggy, this will hopefully be worked out. I tried to get a refund, but Steam said 3 hours was TOO much gameplay, so I guess I'm stuck getting infuriated by cones and collisions with other players.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Tl;DR: Buy it. Pros- Fun and balanced gameplay, perfect mix of everything- Playing against friends is great and rage inducing- Textures look great and it runs well- Active mods who are open to hearing about ideas and bugs- Good course design- Modifiers add a new twist to the game that can be niceCons - Only 2 courses. More to come soon so not really a con.- Music isn't fitting on the Oasis course, is apparently getting changed soon- Chat is in upper case only which isn't that big of a dealOverall It is an above average game. It was only $6.50CAD which is a steal at the moment. Friends and I have over 10 hours each and the game isn't even halfway made yet. With a possible level editor coming this game is a must buy for any steam user. Rating based on price: 9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								For an early access game, with little to no content... I have never had so much fun playing a video game in YEARS now, Golf with Friends is easily the funnest thing I have ever done.The game itself is extremely well polished for early access, if they didn't say on the store page, they could have easily sold this as a full release and nobody would question it, even with only two courses (18 holes each) it's so well done.The music is very happy sounding, and quite addicting, it repeats on a loop basically forever... But you don't even notice it, even on a loop it's just that fitting to the game.  I could listen to this on a daily basis and still love it.The physics of the game are almost flawless, with a little skill you can predict exactly where the ball will go, and sink that hole in one every time.The courses, for there only being two... Are beautifully designed, with the classics such as windmills... All the way to being eaten by a sphinx, going throughout it's body, and being launched out into a temple of doom.You've also got loops, half pipes, bouncing platforms that launch your ball all over, bank shots off pillars, running along the walls, fake holes that launch you off the course. They've got it all!It's a lot of fun playing singleplayer, sadly there are no AI so you're all alone, but it's decent fun.But once you add even a single friend to the game... Oh boy, get ready for one hell of a time! The more you add, the more fun it is.  Exponentially more fun, when on Skype or other method of talking to your other players.The dev team for this game is very small, only two people, but they are extremely active in the community discussions, taking suggestions, helping with issues, and are just providing an outstanding experience for their users. 10/10 game, 15/10 devs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I am hoping at some point they add a leveling system so you can unlock new things as you play(Such as ball patterns, hats or trails). There are only 2 maps right now but I am so excited to see the new ones coming out in the future. I check their forums almost daily to check to see whats to come and what is in all of  the recent updates.. Overall would totally reccommend to pretty much anyone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game is a lot of fun.. I would love for more levels ect but really early access. The only thing that gets me raging is when i hit something that isn't there and lose a stroke. Other than that the game is great and can't wait to see what else is added!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								You wouldn't expect a person who plays GTA V constantly to like an indie mini golf game but I believe it holds a lot of potential. This game is super early access and only has 2 courses but playing with your friends is such a great and competitive time.Some people might argue and say that it's super limited and gets boring and they're right, about the first part. But I don't think it ever gets boring! Playing the same courses over and over again offers more fun because of the Online factor. You never know what's going to happen differently when you replay it with friends.That's why I'd recommend this game to anyone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								It's minigolf. Not that hard to do, really. You probably already knew that from the title of the game.It's currently in early access (Feb. 23, 2016) so there's not a whole lot of everything yet, but what's there now is polished and fun. More courses are promised, along with a level creator, so there should be tons of replayability in the future.Also, the devs are super active in responding to community feedback. Moreso than I've seen for most indie developers, or game devs in general. They are extremely passionate about their game and don't want anyone to be left out due to a small glitch that doesn't allow them to play.If you don't like minigolf, though, there's nothing here for you. If you don't like minigolf, however, chances are you would not be reading reviews for a minigolf game.I'd rate it8/10Get it now before, the price goes up (if it ever does) later in development, and also to support the devs to finish this. I might rate higher if/when new content is released and is subsequently good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								In it's Early Access state it's a great game for short intervals. Especially if you have friends that don't like the same genre as you do - because everybody knows how to play and enjoys some virtual golf. And if you want it to become crazy fun, just enable ball-jumping and bouncy underground in ""Custom"" mode and let everybody get creative with their snipes and slam dunks. xD Maybe even add low gravity to the mix. Or play legit minigolf physics in ""Classic"" mode. All of that you can do in the Early Access build and the two maps are really rich with basic but very diverse courses in two clearly divided difficulty levels where Forest is ""Easy"" and Oasis is ""Advanced"". And don't fear 12 player games, you can turn player collision off if you so desire.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Golf games are boring. Admit it. But what about a golf game where your ball is a sqaure and you can shoot your square at your friend and send them off the course, making them start over? Now that's a fun golf game. In this game, yes, you play golf with (Big Surprise) your friends. And yes, you can play an average game. But why not spice up the settings? Why not play golf with eggs? Why not turn jump on and watch golf balls jump around the course? Why not both? This game is honestly fun with some good friends, and can make some good laughs.Over all? 7/10 (With some friends)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I truly enjoy playing this. I currently only have a few friends who own it, but that is okay because the game is actually really fun. I am hoping at some point they add a leveling system so you can unlock new things as you play(Such as ball patterns, hats or trails). There are only 2 maps right now but I am so excited to see the new ones coming out in the future. I check their forums almost daily to check to see whats to come and what is in all of  the recent updates.. Overall would totally reccommend to pretty much anyone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Golf With Friends is without a doubt the mini golf game that Steam has been missing.

								Golf with friends is easily one of the most fun games I've played in a while. It's just pure and simple fun.At the moment, there are only two courses, the Forest (self explanatory) and Oasis, which is an egyptian themed course. The lack of other courses hasn't turned me off from the game, however. The levels are very repeatable and fun, and it's always interesting to try to find inventive ways to get a better score on a certain hole. In the future they will be adding more courses, so if the lack of courses is a turn off for you, it will soon be fixed. One thing I would really like to see in this game is a course creator, so that the community can make their own courses. Overall, I highly recommend this game. It's great, simple fun and for only $6, that's an awesome deal.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Great game! It is really well made an a blast to play with friends. Although it is in beta I didn't encounter any issues whatsoever. All I would ask for is Steam Workshop support for custom maps as there are only 2 maps as of this review.Really excited to see how this game develops over time! If you get this game feel free to add me to your friends list!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I wasn't sure if this was going to be terrible but my friends had it so I decided to download it. I thought it was going to just sit in my library but it is extremely fun, I've played it tons with my friends and I will keep on playing. The game does currently lack content but they are putting out constant updates with new maps and things to do. You can also invite freinds to the lobby now instead of scrolling through the server browser. I feel that the game will get boring soon but I'm loving it and if you have a group of friends to play it with, its definitely worth the money. (especially since its really cheap)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
