												Lacks depth and character.Theme of the game is amazing but unfortunately it lacks imagination.Building your gladiators does not feel satisfying because they are all just sum of different attributes,they lack character.So much more could have been done regarding gladiator customization like unique perks they get when they are created,different classes that can wear different equipment,maybe skill trees so you can level your gladiator in different directions as it gathers experience.Equipment could be diversified adding different bonuses (maybe special abilities your gladiator can use in combat).Right now game feels bland and offers very shallow experience...
