												Overall rating is 6/10.This is a somewhat fun, addictive and non-traditional soccer (or football, if you will) game. Instead of controlling any of the characters themselves, you instead get access to a wide range of powerups that you can use to influence the outcome of the game. Initially, you begin with just mines that you can place to blow up the enemy players (or even your own, if you're so inclined) but as you progress in the game, you get access to other powerups (some of which include cows that run people over, rockets, UFOs that pick players up, rabid fans that help your team kick the ball, etc).Each match in the single player mode has an objective, which may range from ""win the match within the time limit"" to ""get the score to exactly 5:4"". Therefore, there are times where you'll have to use your weapons on your own team mates to manipulate the score.The gameplay is relatively fun, whacky, hilarious and addictive, although the game suffers immensely from imbalance. Some items, such as the Red card (that sends a player off the field) are incredibly overpowered and ruin all the challenge in the game. I would actually recommend trying to avoid some overpowered items if possible, as they completely eliminate any difficulty in the game, which further removes any real incentive to use different tactics to complete the objectives.The graphics and sound are pretty mediocre, although none of this is particularly bothersome for a game of this nature.Apparently this game has multiplayer too, although I haven't tried it out yet. I imagine it'd be relatively fun, particularly if you were able to restrict the use of some items (i.e. the aforementioned red card). Overall, I would recommend you try out the game, as it did hold my attention enough to actually beat it.			",1140,477,42,159,142,13,199

												Make no mistake. FootLOL is a hilariously fun game. Just don't expect some football. This game deals in chaos. If your toons aren't getting blown up, knocked down, displaced, abducted, ravaged, and etc then you are probably doing it wrong.The game offers several levels divided between a few planets and it's guaranteed to give you at least 3 hours worth of content. Getting the game at 100% only requires you to play up to level 35 so keep that in mind if you plan on going for it.My only complaint about this game is that I have to reinvite people whenever our match ends. A lobby would be great.			",1696,736,69,252,221,20,307

												Truly this game is the zenith of football simulation. Watching the players performing a ballet of football skills like geishas at court, whilst conjuring the most splendid of tactical plays is a symphony to the purist's heart. When one places a cheeky landmine in front of the opponent's goal keeper it brings to mind the great tactics of Clough, Shankly and Ferguson.The football revolution is here and it's packing airstrikes.

												Ahh... What can i say? FootLOL is an arcade-casual soccer game. Not pure soccer but soccer and action-fantasy maybe. It's name is FootLOL for a reason. FootLOL is the game that you can do almost everything to your opponents. Airstrikes, flame strikes, cows, ufos, meteors... Lot of abilities. Also different type of planets to play. Easy to play, you can improve your team and challenge for cups. Very strange type of soccer game cause of goals and power abilities.

												FootLoL enticed me with its soccer theme and its madness on the field. Upon playing the game a little bit more, it's definitely not for me. I'm not a casual gamer by any means but do like playing games like this in-between other games. Reason I cannot recommend it is that it gets boring after a while. I may find it boring, you may not. Heck, I'm sure kids would like this game.An emphasis on strategy should be put here rather than soccer. Although soccer seems to be the main theme of the game, you (as the player) have about zero control over the players on the pitch. The only thing you can control is placing tactical objects or weapons on the pitch. Some of the weapons that are included are land mines (which blow-up opponents when they are near), meteorites where meteors will literally come from the sky and hit the field, a herd of cows can be used to flatten your opponent, ball multipliers to increase the amount of goals you score when the ball goes into the net and not limited to turrets. Counter-measures are also included to help you defend your players from your opponent. Armor can be equipped, bubble spheres can be erected to protect players (or the ball from moving forward), speed boosts or speed traps, protective bubble shields that can block ball and players as well as the ability to expand the opponents net. There are A LOT of weapon options in game which is a great feature.The players themselves do not make much of an effort to dodge any of the obstacles. Essentially, they have positions but players will move near the ball if it's close by. The game feels pretty balanced. Deciding which weapons to take to the ""battle""field can literally make a night and day difference in the score. Choose the wrong power-ups or use them too much and watch your score stay stagnant. There are a few game modes in FootLoL : championship mode where you tour the world/solar system, quick match and multiplayer mode. Most players will most likely choose to pursue championship mode before anything else. In championship mode you start with a certain amount of slots and certain amount of abilities. As the game progresses (and the better you do in-games), the cash-rewards become a lot bigger. The AI within the game also becomes progressively difficult although most of the time beating him isn't the most difficult. Meeting certain objectives laid out before hand is where the challenge lies. Each match is timed and the team with the most goals when the clock hits zero, wins. The better the performance and the more conditions that are met means a better payout. Don't forget though, your opponent can possess the same abilities as you!Visually, the game play is cool because there is a lot going. Watching meteors fall from the sky while sheep are running across the field while blobs are blocking certain players can get insane. As I said, visually watching it is cool. Playing it is a completely different story (because this is where the limitations start coming in).The biggest issue for me is that this feels like a game I would play on the iPad. I understand the ""mobile gaming"" platform is slowly evolving and yes programmers should get some credit where credit is due, but I certainly do not like purchasing games that could be played on an iPad (on a rig that costs a lot more than one). As I've said, if you're into strategy and something a little bit different with some outlandish effects, I'm sure you'll enjoy the game. If you're here for some soccer or some sort of inclusiveness, it's not here. If they added a gimmick or something in which you could control players, I'm sure that would have added another depth to the game. Overall, I won't recommend it as it's not my cup of tea. However, if you do like this (even for a full price), I would recommend getting it. I think there was enough put into the game to get enough bang for your buck.RATING : 6.0/10 Gameplay C Story / Campaign C+ Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music C Replay-ability C+ Overall  CScreenShots :  Championship mode view Abilities upgrade menu The meteor effects are pretty good and deliver a solid umph Meteor after-effect There is a lot you can do in this game that could be considered cheating Weapon options ",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

												worth it during a sale.  my issue is with the unlock system.  the fun of the game comes with the chaos you can create with explosives and such to try and manipulate the game in your favor.  well, you start with one item, and have to unlock the rest by playing through one of the most uninteresting campaigns ive ever seen in a videogame.  I see no reason why i should have to spend 5 hours unlocking items to play multiplayer with my friends.I got about halfway through the campaign and could bear it anymore.  again, maybe worth it on a sale if you're prepared to grind, but i was very disappointed i couldnt just jump into an enjoyable multiplayer experience			",134,17,1,14,11,1,18

												I'm not a fan of football games, but this did make me rethink the fun we can have with football. This game's genre (what I think) is Real Time Strategy (although you cannot control the players), because this game needs you to make decisions whenever you think the team might need some support, and because this game is not turn-based (as you can see in the video in steam store). If you play Battlefield 4, it's like having a pocket sized commander mode, very small map, giving support to your fellowmen. I did enjoy doing that,, until I've done around 40% of the Earth Stage. Since I'm a perfectionist, I tend to get all the challenges done (challenges are written at the top left of the screen, with scores you have to have in order to complete the challenge). This REALLY gets harder and harder for me, as a strategy game newbie. I did also see myself doing some facepalm because I was being serious with just a game *facepalm*. For now, I would recommend you buy this, instead of buying snacks that will be a pleasure for few minutes, and buy this game, which will be playable for such a long time. It's definately not a game you would want for Dota2-like competition, but rather for fun like throwing grenades at each other in PAYDAY2. So, yeah, don't buy if you're pro at Dota2... Other informations- From what I've played, 1 stage is around 1;00~2;00, with endless replayability. It does not have any RPG features, except maybe the skills or upgrades you can buy with the income.And last but not the least, the game is VERY light compared to the price, with 96MB of installation and around the half for download... Guys, I really don't know if I should recommend this.. -.-			",200,15,6,13,11,2,24

												It's not a bad game, but just really boring after an hour. I was able to beat all the Earth missions just using mines. In some cases, my team AI was too good for the opposing team AI and I had to replay missions where I had to win 4:3 or something odd like that. There are really only a few powers that actually would help you during a match. There isn't much depth to the game, which makes it more of a chore to play after a while. Combine this with the fact that there is no local multiplayer/co-op and the online multiplayer is dead anyways, so unless you buy it in a bundle it isn't really worth picking up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What is FootLOL: Epic Fail League?Genre: strategic football/soccer game with RPG elementsSetting: funny stickman characters (=the players) battling for victory in football/soccer matchesDifficulty: 3/10 --> basically easyLength: 5 hours for a single playthrough, up to 10 for getting all rewardsMode: singleplayer campaign, multiplayer (abandoned)The positive aspects:- fresh and funny gameplay. You do not control the players themselves, but have to guide them to scoring goals by using power-ups in the right way- lots of power-ups with different characteristics: meteors, cows, flak cannons, air strikes, shields, teleporters, ball clones, crazy fans and a lot more- RPG-ish upgrades to improve your team and cosmetics (new flags, eyes, hats etc.)- Pretty nice sound effects, especially when you spam the pitch with different power-ups simultaneouslyThe negative aspects:- strange goals. Sometimes it happens that you put the ball wide, but then it drops into the net, counting as a goal.- gameplay gets repititive after a short time- 2D/3D graphics mashup. You're getting used to that, but putting the 2D players into 3D would have been nice- The biggest counterpoint surely is the strange tasks you have to complete. In most of the games you have to complete three tasks, which are always special scores. For example, for the first task the game wants you to lead by 3-0, for the second task to be down by 3-7, and for the third/final task to win by a 5-goal margin.On the one hand, this gameplay element adds some tactical depth into the game as you sometimes have to support the opponent's team and sabotage your own squad. Otherwise - pardon me - strange thing to support somebody you have to beat, isn't it? Like corrupting the game. And I don't think that FIFA developed this game- multiplayer is as good as dead, unfortunatelyResult (and summary for those who have no time reading):Ok, basically FootLOL is a fun football game with entertaining gameplay and a huge variety of power-ups to reach your goals. Though there are some counterpoints, like strange goals and tasks to complete, you can have a nice time spamming the field with cows and meteors. I recommend you to try it out (at sales time)!

												An amazing take on Football, instead of actually controlling the players or perhaps managing a team you are tasked with essentailly sabotaging the other team using as many skills as possible, these range from blowing them up with mines to spawning footballs on your team so they can take shots while the keeper is on the floor dying. I haven't been able to try the Multiplayer aspect but I assume it's pretty much the same but with more havoc. There is a skill progression in it however so it would be wise not to venture to that mode until you have aquired all skills as you have no idea what your opponent may have.8.5/10 For being fun, hilarious and amazing to play with extremely responsive controls.YouTube Gameplay:

												Seems a lot more fun than it actually is.  The first few levels brought me to audible laughter and a near-perpetual grin, but the moment that great first impression wears off there's just nothing else there.  Your players' stats are way behind the other team's relatively quickly, which means that what you ""really"" end up doing is grinding money to buy player stats up.  It's a great idea with tons of spectacle to it but the veneer wears off surprisingly quickly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What this game is about?It's about using powerups to manipulate playing field in order to score goals or fulfill some aims of the stage like for example winning in a set score 3:2. This game is a little indie game, where you go through more or less chaotic stages where you and your opponent use different power ups in order to achieve victory by any means. Player with most goals win the match. Some exapmles of basic power ups:- haste to one footballer for about 10 seconds- stop time for about 5 seconds- create some shield that blocks the ball- meteor that can knock players down for a moment and destroy shields- mine than knocks down players for about three seconds and can push the ball in a direction opposite to the side of explosion (physics, you know?)The player also have possibility to buy some advancements like more income or slight advance in speed of footballers (that look like 2d cartoony like characters, funny enough). There is one basic exploit. About an hour into the game and I have found one stage that you can reload to have goals like win with goal pattern 1:0, 3:0 and so on. Such a game takes about 10-30 seconds to win and gives 750$. Upgrading income by 4% costs 500%. Please do the math yourself and calculate how much time would it take to upgrade your income to a maximum level (25 times 4%) thus giving you a permanent upgrade of 100% more income. Rince and repeat such a stage that you can complete under 10 seconds and earn so much money in about 2 hours of gameplay that you will (yes, will) win the game without any difficulty at all. Thus such an exploit is quite a fun killer to me. The game is still nice to play and use really wacky powerups (cow stampede, meteors, bombarding, spawning additional balls so you can have scores like 38:19, so on and so forth) but why shouldn't a player not use such an exploit to win the game easily? There is no motivation to play more levels, and some of them can drag itself for about 2 minutes. This can be long, believe me. ---------- For anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												FootLOL: Epic Fail League developed by Lion's Shade & released on 17 Sep 2013 on the PC platform. On Metacritic (http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/footlol-epic-fail-league), it has:    An average user score of 5.2, from 3 critics only -at the time of this writing. What would you expect from a game that combines soccer with cows, mines, spartans, cannons, UFOS and air plane bombers & other unspeakable objects of destruction(s)? If you answered a logical, reasonable, responsible gaming experience – Shows you the red card out *blows whistle* You are dismissed from the field! But on a serious note, is this title really worth the money/time for all the utter insane chaos? It's really hard to say depending on how you view it.FootLoL is not your normal standard soccer game. It's not about winning but rather making the other team fail. Wait, isn't that the same? No. And sometimes, you make your own team fail. Wait, what? Yes, you heard me right. If it doesn't make sense, not everything has to make sense and sometimes you have to defy logic for a gaming experience out of this world. That's partically what FootLOL tries to deliver. An Utter Out of this world holy cow chaos beyond oblivion pancakes with 'WTF” stamped on it. FootLoL offers 3 game mode:    A campaign – I believe there are 60 levels that span across 4 planets. Yes, it's serious intergalactic domination business.    A quick match – A standard game with 4 types of specific game play for you to pick from    Online play – Similar to quick match but you have the option to play online with friends/against other players Controls & Visuals:FootLol controls is very simple. As for the visuals, for me it's okay. It's not pixelated, everything looks simple & clean. I have no complains on this 2 department. Controls, mechanics is working as intended, nothing is broken and no bugs encountered. FootLOL even allows you to customize how your players look. Although limited but it's something cool to run around with a cowboy hat and all your players looking -_- like this. Weeee!Animation is fluid, no choppy performance issue but the music after XX hours I couldn't take it anymore. I switched it off and played my own mp3 list. It was a much more rewarding experience when you are listening to “ice ice baby” while leading 50-3. you know? My Personal ThoughtsLast steam sale, I wanted to purchase a similar product within this context of genre@gameplay. Something just for the fun & casual however I skip it. This time around, I went for it. Looking at the blue mini characters that goes “Weeee” when you blow them up to the sky...I dont know. Satisfying in some sense? Sending hordes of cows onto the pitch, deploying cannons that scores goals for you, sending off the entire team or converting your players into Spartan warriors. Epic. Tons of laughter & fun.There's 2 issue arising from the game by the time you completed your second planet.    Things are no longer funnyYou are basically picking up skill set to counter your opponent's skill set or most of the time or  you practically send off the entire team 90% of the game. Across 4 planets.     The Darn objectivesIn my opinion, the objective is the biggest flaw of the game. It comes as a double edge sword. While it gives player challenges to utilize different strategy from each game, it hampers the fun. All of a sudden, you feel as if you are restricted and no longer have freedom to cause mayhem.Apart from that, If you are trying to obtain 100% achievement, you will hate the objective system as it is built to annoy the crap out of you. You're here to have fun, why can't I win all the matches? Why must my team lose? Why must I follow the score line at half time? Why are you restricting me now?! WHY????????I didn't enjoy my game anymore once I was at third planet as the objective was killing my fun moment and I want to get 100% achievement but I doubt I will be able to do it now considering the oponent@AI has so many skill set available to them. You wont be able to meet the objectives with all this mess thrown at you. /sad My SummaryFootLoL is certainly fun and refreshing to play with friends/with others but I doubt it can keep it's player base in the long run. I just wished there was a little more to do/or to see as I traveled to other planets. But everywhere I go, I lay waste. Lol.I am not sure if the opponent strategy was well thought off or just randomly assigned. Some of them are in a mess. You can't counter mess with more mess. You can only delay or hinder the mess from becoming a bigger mess for your team. Did my sentence make any sense to you? No? I can assure you that I am still sane at this point of writing.Due to that, if you are playing this product just for the fun and don't focus on the objectives at all. You'll be riding cows on UFOS. If your emphasis is on objectives, the cows will be riding you on UFO's instead. Without further delay, before I start to sound like an insane person, on the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for FootLOL: Epic Fail League is an EPIC 5/10.  *weeeeee*			",72,33,1,11,11,0,13

												FootLOL is a fun take on football, but unfortunately manages to stay fresh for only a few hours or so. It's best played in short sessions of about 30 minutes. You don't actually control any of the players but you can help them out by keeping them safe, or by hurting your enemies. You do this by using power-ups.Your team will shoot when they're near the goal and they'll do the best they to keep the enemy from scoring. Finishing ('winning' is the better word here) matches will earn you money and completing objectives will earn you even more money. This money is used to use more power-ups, or to let you choose more of them, or to improve the AI of your team, for example.The graphics are simple and the sound effects are very basic but it has a certain charm, I guess.There are several worlds to complete so it will take at least a couple of hours to complete it. I grew tired of it before that, but it was a fun, unusual game anyway. If you like casual games about football/soccer FootLOL is the game you're looking for.[Rating: 72/100]			",1658,633,69,221,194,16,225

This. This was fun.The 'campaign' in FootLOL is a series of very short (< 3mins) matches where you basically try to win the match by blowing up the other players (with mines, fireballs, and charging cows) and also by giving your players some temporary advantages (such as speed boost, shields, and sparta combat gear).  Then there's the whole suite of abilities that alter the field of play, like sticky goo, holodomes that block balls, flaming soccer balls that goalies won't defend against, fans that charge the field in uniform to both play and take out the opponents, and many others.It is absolutely awesome to send dozens fans to storm the field and then let loose a bunch of extra soccer balls in front of the opponents goal.  Scoring comes fast and furious even without blowing up the goalie.While this great little game doesn't take too long to complete (2 hours to complete the many matches for Earth, and then another 2 hours total for the Moon, Mars, and Saturn) it sure is a lot of fun.   8 out of 10.

												Let's get the elephant out of the room first: FootLOL: Epic Fail League has, far and away, the stupidest name for a video game I've ever played.Okay. FootLOL is actually pretty freakin' sweet. All the wacky/fun/overpowered weapons of Worms combined with the simple yet addictive progression of Plants Vs Zombies. It's not very difficult, and it's not very ""interesting"" in an intellectual sense - once you've tried out all the powerups, there's not much to do but tear through the game with whatever setup you like. If you know what you're doing, games ending 60-0 are not uncommon. Still, it's a heck of a lot of fun for an hour or two!			",590,167,10,85,43,4,95

												This game is... Decent. It's... almost? Worth the money? It's fun if you have a friend to play with. But other than that, it's not that good. Not to mention unlocking everything is a chore. I can get behind the idea. It's really unique. But... I just don't like how... monotonus it is? Anyway, just get it when it's on sale.

												FootLOL is a cheeky little game you can have lots of fun with, by yourself or online with others.  You don’t have to be a fan of football to enjoy this game by any means.  You just have to be someone that doesn’t take this game seriously.  If you can get behind the sheer lack of purpose other than hurling exploding bovine at your rivals, then you’ll certainly be able to get on board with FootLOL.			",73,6,2,3,4,1,9
