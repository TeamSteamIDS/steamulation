												I feel real bad to have to say this, but... good intentions don't make (alone) a good (decent...) game.I support young developers, small teams and so on... but, I think also there are limits for what is sellable or what is not...Have you ever seen a game that make Steam crash??? Often, when this game crash, it make Steam going on an infinite looping trying to sync... what, I really don't know.I own 200+ games, and played the same numbers pre-Steam era, and this is surely one of the most bugged game I ever encountered.Let me better explain:This game is the third version of the series.This serieshave been plagued from the start by a good number of terrible bugs.However, this version is surely the better of the lasts... and still, is quite unplayable (in the current status).The funny part, is not that the game itself is bad or something (is interesting), but, it simply crash constantly and for any stupid reasons or actions!This game have potential! But...On the forum you read ""Please refer any bug you encounter"", and this sound ridicolouss after some hours of playing, as:- the game often crash using the editor and the editor itself is pretty bugged- the game 3D engine seems to make the crash for at least half (and also better) graphic cards on the market- the game crash randomly after playing one hour or so (for whatever reason, is never the same)- the game (as said) MAKE STEAM CRASH!!!- on the ""gaming"" experience part, this is not a bad product, but also not a really good one: it's decent and quite funny, but miss some options and is not so deep on any field... and why bother, if I can't play it!I really hope for some improvement or patch, but many of this bugs have been reported (also by me) already for the last version, so...

Pro Basketball Manager 2017Gameplay:Let me get this out of the way first, I am not a huge Basketball fan. I went into this game with very low expectations and I think it was for the best. Pro Basketball manager plays pretty much like a normal  game, you start out by customising your character and then you are given a team to control. Pro Basketball Manager 2017 has a pretty steep learning curve. You are not served everything like food on a platter. Pro Basketball Manager 2017 introduces you to its mechanics as you make your way through the game and more options pop up. You can strategize the overall coaching style and are able to make minute changes while you are still inside a game. You are able to easily control even the smallest of things. The UI in Pro Basketball Manager 2017 is clean and inviting to play. Pro Basketball Manager 2017 is a pretty solid management game if looked at what it offers in terms of gameplay. Not everything is good with it though.For starters, I wasn’t able to play the game for a long time due to its horrible latency issues. The load times are very long and there is a horrible time lag between click and respond. Everything felt clunky and it was a pain to sit through that and try to concentrate on actual management of the game. That was when I was running it on a PC well above its given system requirements. Another word of warning is that despite it stating on the store page that it runs on Windows 7, it does not. Combine that with a myriad of bugs that plague the title and the constant crashes and the playing through the title becomes a frustrating experience. Another problem that arises with Pro Basketball Manager 2017 is its translation. The game is set in French by its default language when you start up the game and that is obvious considering its developers origin. But the English translation of the game has many problems. The names of players are spelled wrong, common instructions and rules are difficult to read and understand sometimes. This might have been a small issue had I been playing NBA or a game of such sorts but in a game where reading and managing is your main work, this does puts an obstacle in the path. If anyone reading this has played a game called “Ea Cricket 2007”, this game reaches those levels of problems with its translation. Overall, while Pro Basketball Manager 2017 is a solid management sim and it has its bright spots, it is bogged down heavily because of its latency issues and the plethora of bugs it contains.VisualsThere is nothing to much to say in terms of visuals in a management sim but whatever Pro Basketball Manager 2017 shows, it shows it neatly. The UI is fresh, simple and user friendly. It lets you in the steep learning curves of the game and does not get clunky even when there are a lot of options trying to clutter the screen.OverallPro Basketball Manager 2017 is a solid management sim, there is no doubt about that. But it is affected by a huge number of issues which take the game from high to low. The horrible latency issues and the bugs are only the few to state. Pro Basketball Manager 2017 needs polish and a few patches to solve out its problems. But if you are able to run the game properly, you will find a good management sim with a steep but rewarding difficulty curve.Pros:+Clean and Simple UI+Solid Management game sim at its coreCons: -Horrible latency issues-Myriad of bugs-Bad translation-Steep Learning curveRating: 55/100This review was brought to you by Pcgamesnnews.

												Let me start by saying that I owned the 2015 version and Cyanide's football game (out at the same time).  I bought them together and was so disappointed with the products that I vowed to never buy another Cyanide game.Fast forward 2 yrs or so and after researching the game for a bit, I hesitantly took the plunge.  I can honestly say that after 37 hours of game time, I'm very pleasantly suprised with this one.  The game world is huge (which for me is good and bad).  I love the depth but on the other hand, when you have to spread your efforts to do so much, you miss details.  Its the dilemma of either doing a lot of things good or a few things great.  I do think that they've done a lot of things good.  The other drawback to having a huge world is that the larger the world, the slower the sim time.  I'm playing NCAA and NBA and sim times are pretty slow.I really enjoy the statistical history presented.  The only problem that I have with this, is it doesn't seem to go past the past 10 - 20 years and isn't completely accurate.As mentioned, I'm playing NCAA and NBA.  The recruiting  process could definitely be tweaked a little and there basically isn't any difference between powerhouse programs and low end schools.Navigating through the UI (user interface) is very frustrating and slow at times and the American Basketball leagues don't seem to function or be as realistic as some stand alone College or NBA sims that I have played but in this one game for about half the price of one of those games, you get the entire basketball world.  That's pretty amazing.I haven't had any issues with crashingOverall, if you are a basketball fan and enjoy sim games I definitely recommend you try this game.  (Never thought I'd be saying that after the 2015 mess)You just need to do it with the understanding that the American worlds aren't as refined as some other individual games provide but you have (a very functional) basically an entire basketball world to become part of.I am very much looking forward to updates/improvements and seeing what this franchise can become.Also the steam workshop group seems to be very involved and at least 1 very detailed real world mod (Crowder I believe) is in the works.There currently are 3 mods in the workshop.  I have subscribed to all 3 and have successfully pulled from those mods to update my playable database.			",25,20,8,5,28,2,12

												Well, first of all, I wanna say the most important thing here - do not buy this game!Reasons:1. Rules are wrong! For example, NBA games has 12mins of quarters, this game has 10 mins;2. Quite of a hard transfer market;3. BUGs everywhere;4. Games interface is horrible (slow etc)5. 3D is horrible;6. Hell of a expensive! It should cost something about 5€Thats it! I hope u liked my review!			",38,7,1,3,4,2,4

												Don't be scared about the hours played. I have several accounts with the game. :)I'd give it a 11.5/20 with the amount of bugs it currently holds. If the developers work on those mistakes, this can quickly rise to 15 or 16.

												Apart from the great job Crowder is doing... ♥♥♥♥ing hell Cyanide and Umix studio!! I bought the game on day one and i've played it for 3 hours!Crowder is doing his best to make this game playable but, hey, he's not part of the developing team (i guess). I dont see effort from both cyanide and umix to fix this game!No official update from them: they put a game in the market without real names, real logos, competition name/systems which may be ok, but damn! release a patch to fix all these problems! I was expecting an official patch from the team for the real names, competition name/systems and bla bla blaVery poor job from them. Hire Crowder for the next year, he will make a better game for sure. I'm so dissapoint with umix/cyanide behaviour. Worst 20eur i've ever spent in my life...For sure, you wont have my money next year			",0,0,0,0,3,0,0

												Good game, have extremely bad latency problems however, my laptop is far beyond the recommended specifications to run this game, would be nice for this to be fixed asap. Also game attempts to instal each time on start up saying performing first time start up. This happens for over 10 minutes each startup even when game has already been installed and downloaded. Great game other than how slow it runs on my laptop and the annoying instal feature. Will struggle to play until these problems have a solution.			",0,0,0,0,3,0,0

												I have bought this game, but I can`t play it. When I run the game, there is a message that says ""this application requires one of the folowing versions of the .NETFramework: .NETFramework, Version=v4.6"". I´ve tryed to dowload it (this version) but I can´t install it. Is not possible to make this game doesnt need this version of NetFramework ??For example, I played without this problem with ""Probaskeball manager 2016"". ",0,0,0,0,6,0,0
