												This game is pretty exciting and is a lot of fun but unfortunately there isn't enough content to make it worth $10. This feels like a demo-there is only 1 ski course and you start from the beginning every time, and there are no other features other than going down that 1 hill in this game.If more was added ie. tubing, snowboarding, multiple tracks etc then I would recommend this but I just cant at this point.

												OK, I've made two seperate attempts at this, each one was for 12 minutes for a total of 24 minutes so far.The first time was so overwhelming that I was literally falling over as I took the huge jumps into deep valleys. My stomach was in my mouth, the way a rapid drop from heights would do (not VR sickness). As I hit the ground in VR, my knees and legs were instinctively trying to balance me in real life. SO hard to explain. I took the headset off and giggled. The experience completely fooled my brain.So, about an hour later, I tried again. This time I kept telling myself ""this isn't real"", and I was able to actually play and enjoy it. Within minutes, and after crashing multiple times, I totally got it. Bending your knees, and leaning is the key to this. When flying thru the air into a deep valley, and a massive boulder is in your path, all I can recommend is either lean over far enough to avoid it (you seem to have control while catching air), or CLOSE YOUR EYES as you smash into it.I highly recommend this for those that want to crash dive into building VR sickness resistance. Once you build up tolerance in this VR sim, you will be able to play in VR game that uses motion to move around. Hopefully developers will stop thinking we're all a bunch of pansies, and start making games that we can 'walk within the VR environment', like these guys developed. Good job developers. But, it needs polish for sure. Like please include menu options to disable 'in game' music so I can hear my own music.   ",34,13,1,0,9,2,14

												This is the kind of game I've been waiting for. It's fast and it's going downhill (in a good way).It's an arcade type game, you try to avoid trees, boulders etc to survive. You have skiing poles to add speed, and this feels very natural actually (disclaimer; my knowledge of skiing irl is very limited). You turn to the side by kinda tilting your head, and this doesn't make sense to 100% at the beginning. My feeling is that it should be a little more sensitive, but after a few rounds you'll get the hang of it.At first I played with bent knees and leaning a bit forward, great for the sense of speed and immersion, but maybe a little harder to navigate. Standing straight with the feet a bit apart seemed to be a bit easier. And as you can regulate your own speed you can also choose if you want to go furiously wild or a bit slower and more tactical.You'll crash alot, but you'll do better every time as you learn the course. The longer you stay alive, the more points you get. Also seems to be getting points for hitting deer, and there is a snowflake on the score-board that I have no idea what it is yet.The game runs without any problem on my GTX 1070 with 1.5 SS. I have never had any motion sickness so I don't know how this is for the pukers.I'll put this game in my daily rotation for sure. If you like games like ""Unbreakable VR Runner"" then I believe this will be for you. Also it might be a good game to demo to people, because it's not like anything else at the moment.+ Fun, fast, original- €7.99 would be a more fair priceThere is also some minor translation errors, but nothing important.Good work!

												As long as you understand this doesn't intend to be any kind of realistic skiing sim then it's good fun. It's very immersive using your hands to row the ski poles to build speed. It's intensive as the difficultly builds up over the course, I haven't mananged to reach the end due to colliding with swooping eagles partway through; as I said this isn't a simulator.As there's really nothing out there to compare to this, its as good as it gets. Which is a shame as Fancy Skiing shows proof of concept that skiing works great in VR. Fancy Skiing ""isn't"" exactly an awesome game, it's just one long course, and there are no other options. Some of shortcomings in the production include, your virtual skis always point forward, and the music can't be turned off (which can get annoying over times). Basically it's pretty barebones, lacks polish, but sort of priced around being acceptable value.Though I quite enjoy this game, as a rating I'd give it average as an objective game rating. If a more refined skiing title comes along, get that and avoid Fancy Skiing as it's shortcoming will be revealed and this title will easily be forgotten. Giving it a thumbs up is a real stretch. I doubt this game would get so many thumbs up is there was something else/better out there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has a score for distance *and* a score for hitting deer.  It has a single piece of music that wouldn't be entirely out of place in an 80s ski movie.  It's called ""Fancy Skiing VR"".  It contains wonky English.  You'll look like you're doing pelvic thrusts while playing.  I enjoy these things way more than I should, and I'm having a blast playing it in short spurts.As far as being a ski game, I wouldn't exactly call it exquisitely visually realistic or hugely varied like some other ski games, but you can see that in the trailer.  More importantly to me, *this* game has controls which are well-suited to its arcadey nature, and pretty good in general, given the current state of VR.  One could go further by sitting in a swivel chair with Lighthouse markers strapped to your feet or something, but that's not possible at the moment.  Maybe something could be done with planting poles for sharper turns, but that's not necessary given the current nature of this game, and it might end up causing disorientation.  Here, it's simple head-tilting to steer, trigger to jump the fences, and actual ski pole thrusting to get going on the flats!Might be good to avoid if the trailer turns you off, but I'm glad I bought it.

												The price is a complete rip-off. While the game can be fun, there's nothing to it other than repeatedly going down the same course over and over. It kept my attention for all of 12 minutes before I was bored with it. Also, the controls are not ideal. You steer by tilting your head. Not moving it, tilting it. As in, tilt your head 45 degrees to the right to go right. It would be far more intuitive, I think, to have you tilt the controllers as you would with skipoles when actually skiing, although I suppose that might take away from the sense of speed some. For $2.99 it would be alright, but for $10 it's a joke.			",211,73,4,25,11,3,17

												Excellent fun! Addictive!  Really works well in VR.. so much so that you have to be careful not to fall over whilst playing - perhaps it should start with a nursery slope level with a ski instructor !? ;)It's a little bit like Subway Surfer and has the same 'just one more go' feel..  however there's more substance here.. it actually has pretty decent graphics, runs smooth and whilst you couldn't say it's a 'ski simulator', it's starting to get close - just look around at the scenery as you ski down.Of all our games this is the one that gets played *every* time the Vive is turned on..  just to try to get a little bit further on.Highly Recommended   ",42,18,1,0,6,2,2

												Great VR experience. First time slamming in a rock at high speed resulted in me landing on my floor. And it wasn't just me, as I watched my friends do the same, good times. After some runs and being more stable on my feet I can really enjoy the huge jumps and high speeds, great way to move forward compared to the teleporting you'll find in most other places.On a more critical note, as a game it does have just one track, and the bird attacks are annoying at best. Skis are not always in the right position and steering left and right could be improved upon so it does not just track the tilt of the headset, its sideways movement should have more impact on steering.I think the price is acceptable for this small game, I have seen much worse VR games and experiences in this range and above. This game is easily one of the best VR experience so far, which has provided lots of fun, sweat and tears.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Had a lot of fun in this game so far. A VR game that lets you feel like you're going fast while you're standing still. The main reason I decided to write this review is because I don't see it being mentioned what the format of this game actually is: This game is a platformer. Your objective is to get down the hill as fast as possible without hitting the obstacles... or falling prey to Alfred Hitchcock birds.Some people may call it unfair or poor design but, personally I see it as a puzzle. Yes there are times where, if you don't know which side of the slope you need to be on ahead of time, you'll slam straight into a rock with no time to react. You remember which side to be on and do that next time around and you're fine.As a side note, I think this game has single-handedly fixed the circulation problems in my arms and hands.

												I've seen two games with ""Fancy"" in the title (this one and Fancy Slingshot) and both of them are kinda crap. I take it they're using ""Fancy"" the same way Ketchup does.   Fancy Ketchup is better than this though.  Anyway, my review:You start up the game, grab the virtual ski poles and start moving your arms to head down the hill.  Apparently you have to move left and right by leaning left and right (though this isn't made very clear in game).  It also seems like your movement is limited so that unless you're moving left or right VERY early, you're almost guaranteed to splat into something. I let a friend try this game and he nearly fell over because he wasn't prepared for the first jump.... That was amusing to watch, but I wouldn't suggest buying this for that alone.  Basically I got this game primarily because it was in a bundle of VR games, and I wouldn't have purchased it otherwise.Things I liked about this game:  There's a pretty good sense of speed as you get going down the hill  jumping over a small cliff is kinda fun if you have your ""VR Legs""  At least they didn't cram the ""VR"" in the middle of a word like ""FancV Rskiing"" That's it.  Things I didn't like about this game:  You can't really control your movement very well  There doesn't seem to be any variety to the game at all.    There's almost no instructions at all to tell you how you're supposed to ""win"".  It's not realistic enough to be a sim, and there's not enough content to be ""arcadey""  So WTF is it?!I'd say it's an experiment.  Ski down a hill, try to avoid a giant rock, try to avoid some falling rocks, try to avoid the ice stalagtites in the cave, try to avoid the deer running across your path... game over?  Start over!  Same exact path, same exact obstacles, same exact lack of control and same exact results!  Maybe next time I'll see if I can ski backwards!I would recommend avoiding any game with ""Fancy"" in the title. ",844,225,54,90,158,17,114

												I recommend this game but with a Caveat. This game is the perfect one for people getting into VR and not really gamers, friends, girl/boyfriends, and family. I usually have my family members play ""Waltz of the Mage"" as an into game and when they want to try something else its hard to find a good change of pace game. I used to have them do Lab but this is much better. It gives you a feel of real movement that no other VR game I have played to date has given you. I had several family members screaming and falling over ""safely"" trying to get into it and they each loved it.If you are a hardcore solo VR gamer this is not for you. It has limited replay value but it is a great addition to the collection for friends family.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Product received for free
												This is a decent title for what it is. It's a simple vr experience that is fun in small doses but the lack of different courses to pick from makes it get repetative rather quickly. Also the game could use some vibration feedback to help immerse the player. The steering feels a bit awkward too but it works enough to be fun.One thing it really needs to the ability to mute the music though. The track isn't the worst thing to listen to, but it gets old fast. It would be nice to have the option to turn it off so you could listen to your own stuff without having to sacrifice the game sounds as well.This is one of those cheap titles that is worth grabbing if you like sharing VR with family and friends and seeing their reactions. It probably won't have a lot of lasting appeal if you only play VR alone.			",274,33,21,10,21,1,4

												This was headed straight for refund after 5 minutes of play, there didn't seem to be much fun in hurtling along seemingly out of control and slamming face first into virtual rocks. I put it aside to show my partner, thinking if she managed to stay upright and in control of her stomach she'd agree with me. She saw there was a score to beat however, even my paltry effort so that was an incentive to persist. It still feels a bit intense but not in a VR sickness kind of way, my partner felt a bit queasy but it passed and we've figured how to actually steer and not just crash into things.     It's a fun game that's worth the price, gfx and frame rates are good on a 1080 and there certainly is a sense of speed. Just don't show it to your grandparents as their introduction to VR.

												Played it for an hour and had fun with it.Had a couble of bullsh*t deaths but most were fair.The speed is amazing and the steering works if you get the hang of it.Although sometimes it doesn't register the turn as much, but I think that is because of the angled hill.There are these birds which are hard to see and I have no idea how to effectively counter them.One I can sometimes get to fly into a tree, but the second one always hits me right in the sensitive area.It became a bit of a boss for me.It is always the same map and you will notice repeating map pieces.Which is a bit of a turn off.If you get further you will encounter new map pieces though.Had a couple of bugs.After restarting a couple times I couldn't pick up the stick anymore and had to restart the game. Which only takes a couple of seconds so it wasn't much of a hassle.I also got stuck in the ground which made me slow. But jumping got me out of there.All by all it is a fun fairly priced game.What I would like to see added if the dev reads this:Being able to lean your whole body instead of just tilting your head to steerJumping by actually doing a little hop instead of just the triggersHitting deer shouldn't punish you by slowing you down, if it is part of the scoreBoosts, coins, big jumps and traps.

												I had many doubts about purchasing Fancy Skiing, as the game seems to be very sickening in videos (also very fun!): in general I find that quality software need to be inclusive. I must say that on this side, the game is pretty good: the comfort is similar to a cockpit game, here it lacks a reference frame but also miss any rotation of the screen (the most toxic movement in VR, who comes from DK1-2 knows) so there are only three-axis acceleration but no rotation. The fact you need to move a lot is also good, because your balance is not 100% on the vection side (it's also nice as a workout). Basically, if the slightest movement is nauseating maybe you can't play with Fancy Skiing, but you don't need an iron stomach to be able to play, I'll rate just a bit less comfortable than Hover Junker but way more comfortable than any FPS kind of locomotion. Sorry for the long description with my crappy english, but I would like to get those information before buy so I hope could be helpful for someone.As a game, it's not very polished at the moment (just out from a day o two) and it's one of smaller download I've ever seen, almost 80MB, so don't expect ton of contents or surprising graphics. Anyway it's fun, I mean real fun, you move your stick to gain speed and it's just stunning how natural it feels. For turning, it's a bit weird because the game use your head's inclination: in real world, the centrifugal force make you lean without falling, but here (if you want to play stand, as I suppose it's more fun and real) you're forced to open a lot your legs for stay in balance. With some practice you can achieve to manage it, but controls in general need some works, they're a bit too rough.The game don't own (at the moment at least) torunaments, tracks or any kind of variation. But, for what I saw, it offer a single track with an increasing difficulty. So, like a good old coinop, it's focused on super short sessions (it's game over in minutes) where you learn how to progress with trials and errors. I like this way more than usual endless/random waves (in this case, waves of obsacles) because actually you can progress in it. I've not play the game enough to say about how long it is, or how challenging it is, I hope it's a good mix bethween being too easy, crazy difficult and short. Anyway, being a brand new experience for Vive users, it worth his price just for be able to ski in VR.			",133,49,10,4,27,5,10

												It's fun and it's simple.  For $9.99 it's worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very simplistic, the same run down the mountain with various obstacles, jumps, falling rocks etc .....That being said, i still enjoyed this game immensely as soon as i tried it out. Not sure why but the motion sickness is only very, very slight, despite the speed you can travel in game. Jumps are incredibly fun, will probably turn your stomach! Steering is fine once you get the hang of it and slow down for some of the tighter sections. Really fun game.			",42,22,0,5,3,1,1

												Have currently played for about 2minutes and I already have my moneysworth. This is hilarious. Please buy it so they can expand upon it with better visuals and more variety.No Vive game has made me physically fall over or panic more than this one. Get it NOW.			",73,28,3,16,52,3,23

												Although I gave them a positive review I still may ask for a refund.  On the plus side the game is fun as hell.  On the downside I've only played about 5 minutes and I feel like I experienced everything there is within the game.  There are demos out there with significantly more content then this.  I will likely ask for a refund in the hopes they will release more content and I can rebuy, until then at $10 the value just isn't there.			",18,16,1,0,8,4,1

												LIke project Cars, this is the 2nd game to give me motion sickness.  It was a fun 10mins though and it really did feel like i was hurtling down a slope.   great arms workout also as you have to swing them to get momentum. Shame there is no world leaderboard as in most other games.Have asked for a refund request due to the motion sickness I experienced.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can see how people like this game. It is fast and challenging. It did not give me much motion sickness, but perhaps I am not very sensitive to VR sickness. This game is good but it definitely won't satisfy real skiers (I am one).			",64,50,5,4,72,7,3
