												With the newest update, 1.4.0, i finally feel comfortable giving this game a solid positive review.  Before the update, i was not on the fence as to weather it was a good game or not.  It still is and was a good game, with amazing support from the developer, who actually gives a damn about his product and the people who purchase it.  However, the game felt a little lacking.  I felt less control than i would have liked.  I dont mind hard games and challenges, but i also dont want to feel cheated by the limitations of the simplicity of the game.That is where the beauty is in this one.  You can tweak the settings to suit your gameplay style. The developer gives you the option to make this game your own.  With each update, he doesnt remove options for the player, he just adds more and more.speaking of this most recent update, that is what got me to write the review.  I saw the update note and thought it was going to be the much anticipated player editor. While that will be an amazing addition when it eventually comes, this update was a welcome surprise for me.  Adding the sprint option to speed up gameplay and really let me use the open pitch and give me the ability to get around defenders was wonderful.  Then also adding the ""easy"" dribbling control to go along with it, so that it was really my doing when i lost the ball to the defense by being sloppy with turbo or passing was the icing on the cake.  I feel like i lose or win now based on my actions on the pitch.  The first touch is noticeable, i dont feel as though the defense is stripping me of the ball nearly as often as before, because i can turn and run.Notes: -This is a hard game, easy to pick up and play (especially with friends) but difficult to master-This game almost requires a controller to play, but the controls are tight and responsive-There are still some improvements to be made, but the arrow is always pointing up as this is clearly a passion project that deserves the support of anyone who is interested.If you are a fan of the classic soccer/futbol games of years past, this is a title you must pick up. With a developer that gives great support and is always updating and improving the game based on suggestions from players like you and I, This game feels fresh and like its improving on a successful formula. I can now proclaim it is a great game.			",94,15,0,12,7,2,7

												Quite simply ""Natural Soccer"" is how football games used to be in the 80's so if you ever played the classics such as Kick Off or Sensible Soccer then you will feel perfectly at home playing this great little football game. Before Kick Off arrived football games were pretty much the same with the ball being quite literally stuck to the player's foot but Kick Off changed the rules and we had total freedom and control of the ball as we do today in Fifa and Pes.Well Natural Soccer may just as well be called Kick Off as it's virtually the same, graphics are as simple and fluid as they always were but they sure do move nice and fast and really smooth as well and OpenGL really does do it justice, controls are very easy to pick up if you have played this type of game before but could take some getting used to if you haven't but it is designed to have total ball control which it does with ease so practice will be required. Soundwise there really isn't much to say as it just the crowd with a few whistles and kicks so it would be nice to have a bit more in there but it still sounds great for what is there.In the game there is a league which works well but would like the addition of say a cup competion or indeed a tournament and just imagine online multiplayer but seeing as they are not in there and just the league this still makes for a good challenge but at least you can change the difficulty if you so desire once you start getting some good results, one good option would be to have a practice mode this i'm sure would benefit a lot of gamers wanting to hone their skills especially for ball control as well as free kicks, corners and penalties and i would love to see referees ingame as well but these are just minor things and doesn't detract from an otherwise awesome game but please do play it with a gamepad or joystick or you will just be at a disadvantage.For me personally i have to say this brings so many memories back and one good thing i found is that having owned the game previously before it came to steam is that my saves were still intact and recognised that right away so i didn't have to start over, just to sum up that if you played those old 80's classics you will feel right at home playing Natural Soccer but if you have only been used to Fifa or Pes then you might not find it to your liking and may find it a little frustrating or difficult but it's there to be mastered so why not give it a go?

												This is a very good  Soccer game. If you like those old Genesis and Super nintendo sports game, this game is right up your alley. It's a top down Soccer game. I love soccer and this game is very very good! Soundtrack is nice. Especially dat opening theme is awesome.I'd recommend a controller with this game for ease but playing with keyboard is not hard at all.  ",3609,1330,150,390,488,44,554

												For years I have been looking for a simple soccer game to replace my SWOS and Total Soccer addictions, and although Addictive Soccer, Throw In and Yoda Soccer have been decent attempts they weren't quite what I was looking for.  However, last year I came across this beauty and although it had humble beginnings (the generic blue team vs the generic red team) I felt this could go far.  And it has...It's a great little game which you can pick up and play for a few minutes for a quick fix, or take on a league if you have a spare couple of hours.  The gameplay is the old cliché - easy to pick up and difficult to master - and it can also be very challenging, often leaving me wondering how the AI cut through my defence with such precision.It's refreshing to see a developer being so responsive to their customer’s comments - in its short life he has added two new control mechanisms, changed a multitude of settings and the game just gets better and better with each release.  This little game has big plans, and I can't wait to see how far it goes!An editor is the next big step to allow players to create their own teams, and the potential that we could have another playable, career based soccer game is something I am really looking forward to.  If you like Sensible Soccer, Kick-Off or Total Soccer then do yourself a favour and pick up this gem.  If you like PES or FIFA, do yourself a favour and play a game where quick thinking and your actions with the controller actually make a difference!			",44,5,3,0,9,1,2

												A fun little game, for fans of those old 16 bit classics, Sensible Soccer and Kick Off 2, it's a real thrill to play.Its front end is a little bare, however, the developer is comtinuing to work on this game and intends to add new features and functionality in the future, the base game though feels very solid and smooth, a perfect platform upon which to build a great little footie game.Lacks online multiplayer mode although you can playwith up to 4 (2v2) on a single machine.As it stands now, as a cheap little indie game it works, i'd give it 6/10, with the caveat that, with further development it could have the potential to become a bit of a cult classic, will edit this review if that happens.

												Oldschool top down football (soccer) game inspired by the old classics from the 90s. If you liked those games (KO2/Sensible Soccer) you will like this game. Nothing has quite captured the essence of those games until now. Scoring a goal in in the current generation of 3D football computer games (FIFA/PES) never quite give you that feeling that you earned it. In Natural Soccer, as in the classics from the 90s, it can finally feel like you earned scoring that goal again.But a note of warning to all those that think that winning in games should be served up to them on a silver platter: it is not an easy game. You will battle the control of the ball as much as you battle the opposing team but in my humble opinion this is what really should be like. There are easier control options provided for those that really prefer this, but you will still have to earn that win all by yourself. And when you do win, you will want to feel that way again.All in all a Natural Soccer is a good football (soccer) game for those that like a bit of a challenge.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So far this has been a lot of fun.  It's simple, but something about it hooks me in.  There are a few issues though, specifically around the lack of a practice mode, no multiplayer, a lack of details for how to pull off any other moves (if there are any, i.e. banana kick) and most frustratingly, the difficulty spike between easy and normal.On easy, with natural dribbling on, I win 10, 12 to nothing and can outrun opposition players (the run button seems to work).  Obviously, there isn't much of a challenge at this level.  I change the difficulty to normal and it seems even the mechanics change.  I can no longer run / out-run opponents, they close me down every time and stick to / dispossess without fail.  I can try a passing game, but I encounter the same problem as above, quickly closed down and I don't have (or know of) evasive maneuvres. This difficulty spike, where elements of the game world seem to have changed to increase the difficulty (i.e. run no longer works and the opposition is faster than all my players), is the biggest problem at the moment.  Sure, I may get through it as I've still won at the normal level, but that the easy mode doesn't really prepare you for the normal mode (run vs. No run) is disappointing and ruins the experience a bit.I'd still recommend the game, but with the caveats mentioned above.

												There is no online multiplayer in Natural Soccer.Your options are local multi-player - which is extremely fun - or single-player.The single-player option is fun and challenging at first, but gets boring after a while because the league mode is very long, has no promotion or relegation, no cups, no team management, no team roster, no top-scorer stats, nothing that really bonds you to the team or players. However, I still recommend Natural Soccer to those who want a fun, arcade soccer game to play locally with friends or family.			",85,29,8,11,20,1,9

												A tough one. I mean it did not cost much and it is ok to play. Not bad, but it is also very shallow. There is simply not much to it. Guess it is supposed to be retro, but even the retro games had more than this. It is alpha though. If the game developes in some time, i will change the recommendation.			",68,8,0,15,6,2,11

												I'm actually enjoying playing this game, its not as simplistic as it looks with the controls and difficulty being hard enough to grasp at first but when you score a belter into the top corner you know its feels so much more valuable than the goal you could have scored in FIFA. While I do have my gripes with the game, I feel its customisable enough for me to have my own gamestyle and way to play rather than being pigeonholed into one playstyle.Here is a video of me playing it:

												'Natural Soccer' tends to reminisce in the nostalgic 80's era of sports games, literally the classics such as 'Sensible Soccer' or 'Kick Off'. I had quite a lot of fun playing this game (even though I'm not a die-hard soccer fan) and it's clear to see that the developer put quite an effort into this game!.It may look a simple game from up top but beneath the exterior there's much, such as, a bunch of countries to choose from with team's from their respective division's, tweaking of pitch/gameplay conditions, incorporation of difficulty setting's for the goalkeeper's, live replay's, e.t.c.*Play using a gamepad as it's the only way to truly experience the game and player movement,  using the keyboard is a chore.Pro's:- Supports gamepad's.Lot's of customization setting's for gameplay (replay's, goalkeeper settings,tactic's).Simple but yet intresting graphics choice (looks like the classic's).Bunch of countries to choose from, with team's from their division's.Top-down camera doesn't move sluggish nor too fast (as in some other games).Polished game with no bugs encountered.Con's:-Could add a bit more variation's to the crowd sounds (not that it's bad, just  repititive after a while)Non-existant tutorial and no keyboard button mapping option. (keyboard doesn't seem to have got much optimization)Could use a few changes to the score and name display at the bottom. (bit hard to see sometimes)No player/club customization nor stats or info about them.The pricing for the game seem's just a tad bit high at $15, would have been great at about $10-$13.Overall I'd recommend this game since it provides a polished experience with pretty deep gameplay, staying true to the formula which made 'Sensible Soccer' and 'Kick Off' great.

												I felt a strong sense of nostalgia with this game. It brings me back to some of the old soccor games I have played on SNES and arcades. I actually was very happy that it had controller support. The game mechanics are basic and easy to follow. I do think the price point is a bit high, and would be valued closer to 9.99 or 12.99. Overall though I do recommend this game for the amount of work that was put into it.  ",287,151,7,67,35,1,44

												Wanted to like the game I really did, but after 1 game I know it will be infuriating. I still play sensible soccer to this day and this feels nothing like it. Players are too big, goals are too small.  Which makes every shot either hit the defender or wide or easy save.Passing and movement feel ok. But the business end where the fun is is too much of a chore...EDITHave also noticed the dev upping the ratings with fake accounts. *sigh*			",1250,417,77,121,152,16,190
