Blood Bowl: Chaos EditionMany people will tell you that Blood Bowl is unfair. Other people will tell you the RNG is rigged. Yet other people will defend it with their lives. Blood Bowl is just not a game that respects you, especially if you go out there and try to win by murder. It will spank you, waterboard you and then anally invade you with spiked baseballbat that has glasshards glued on for good measure.I have had my trial by fire on the boardgame and got butchered by experienced players. It was enough to not want to play anymore, mostly because of the discussions with the rulebook in hand. Yet, I was also constantly drawn back to it until I got absorbed by Epic and built myself a nice Eldar army.But then I got the 360 version and was hit over the head with a game that applies the rulebook to a fault. No more sneaking stuff past my opponent, no more obfuscating the rules with 'you're interpreting the rules wrong, muppet!'. Instead, I got steamrolled over and over again, until I wised up and started to take the full time allowance on a turn, always trying to get at double dice on every action that needs them. I begun to make progress, but the on-line was so horrid I turned away from the game.Today, I decided to buy the Chaos Edition for PC on a whim. Fact is that I'm not that into GW-games anymore. I sold off my hobby some time ago, mostly because I outgrew the demographic. Whenever I walk into the GW-store, I feel like a child-molester for one and inviting a kid over to play a game of Epic just has too many negative connotations to it.Getting back in the saddle was easier than I thought, but much of that is in selecting the team that supports my play-style instead of a team that looks bad♥♥♥♥♥but is a dog to manage.Blood Bowl looks very pretty to my eyes. Cyanide did not go for flashy imagery but instead kept it simple and to the point. Game music is likewise utilized and during the matches there is a duo-presentation by two dudes who sadly will have run out of new things to say after you've played a few matches.I have not yet played with the Blitz rules, opting to play Classic-rules (Read GW-authentic) instead. The Classic-rules play by the boardgame rules and follows that ruleset to the letter, which results in nailbiting matches, as long as you play on Hard. I don't say this to be leet. On Easy, you'll win. On Medium, the AI will anally probe you. On hard, the AI gets slammed by the rules as hard as you are. How that can be, I don't know. The game was like this on the 360 too.Winning thus depends on team-choice and choosing a team should be a factor of your playstyle. For me personally that meant a choice between the Dark Elves or the Amazons. After having tried a few games with the Dark Elves I noticed that I couldn't pull off miracle plays with them. I like to dodge and play a passing game and the Dark Elves are the proverbial team for that. (Still the best DLC I bought on the 360.)I started over, going for the Amazons this time, who all have Dodge as a natural skill. At first I felt it was hopeless, but slowly I was getting the results. After being butchered a few times, I got a handle on the Amazons and started to fight the AI to a stand-still. Some time later I managed to win a match with a miracle play, passing the ball from the midfield-line to a Catcher in the end-zone.Blood Bowl is not an easy game. One of the first things a new player should learn is that tackle-zones are the backbone of Blood Bowl. Each pawn on the field has a tackle-zone, consisting of 8 squares around that pawn. Pawns that have overlapping tackle-zone empower eachother, making offence and defence easier. For offence, blocking an enemy pawn is a snap if it has base to base contact with other pawns that are friendly to you. For defence, understanding that tackle-zones are only good for enemy pawns entering it is key.As you play matches, your players will level up, provided they did something that gives them points. There are many ways a player can get EXP and not all of them are obvious. Blood Bowl does however apply them according to the official boardgame rules (if you play Classic, which I recommend.) and does so rigidly. Should you ever question the game's judgement, crosscheck the decision with the ruleset, which is included in the game. I have not been able to fault it sofar.Leveling your players up will allow you to give your players extra skills. There are loads of skills, but not all of them will suit your players or your style. Take the time to read the description of skills. But most of them are obvious. The first extra skill a Catcher should get is Sure Hands. A Runner should get Sure Feet quickly. A Blitzer should keep an eye out for Break-Tackle.Blood Bowl comes with a hefty Single Player experience. First there is the tutorial. This is scripted as heck and it won't allow you to experiment. But for new players it does open the game a little, though it won't go into specifics. Therefore it's better to play a few exhibition matches after you've done the tutorial.The Exhibition matches are perfect for experimenting, because they don't have a persistent effect on your team. Work on your starting set-up and watch the AI closely. Here you get the goods on how teams are played, which is unvaluable information for the other game-modes. Many tactics the AI employs are also good to use by you.Begin a Campaign is a set mode where you buy the team of your choice (or field one of your existing teams) and try to reach the top of the different leagues and tournies.Begin a Competion is like the Campaign, but now you set it up to your specifications before you start play.Story Mode is very different as you're free-agent coach who coaches teams that need your expertise. This time, the focus is on you and your managerial skills. And you'll be tested. Hard.World Cup is like the wolfmother of Blood Bowl. Hear you must lead your team to greatness entering nothing but tournaments and your goal is to eventually qualify for the ultimate event.All these modes can't be completed in a single evening. These modes are all in depth and content rich and successfully completing them will take your dedication and test your motivation.Don't go into this game believing that you'll trash it on your first match. Learn from the AI, see how it handles ball-possession and see how it defends. A wise man once said that no one ever learned something from winning and nowhere is this more true than in Blood Bowl.-Do safest actions first.-Do less safe actions second.-Do dangerous actions last.-Always guard your ballcarrier.-Buy re-rolls pre-game over stuff like Bribes and Bloodweiser Babes.-Cheerleaders and Coaches are the most helpful during kick-offs. Look for other things to buy first.-Use fouls and bribes to disable enemy keyplayers, like Catchers, Throwers and Runners. Don't waste them on rank and file.-Try to use all your re-rolls in a half, they get replenished at half-time. Re-rolls are instrumental to your play, so don't let them go to waste, use them as needed and don't be frugal with them thinking that you'll get a better chance to use them later.I love digital Blood Bowl, but the love took a wile to take hold. Blood Bowl rewards the patient, thinking player and it really opens up to those that stick with it and gain skill. Once you get past the disappointment of playing a game that won't let you win and start to recognize what works and what doesn't, Blood Bowl is one of the more rewarding games to play.For those that want to always win and who want to be leet 24/7, Blood Bowl has little to offer.

												Blood Bowl is a...How to put this? Turn based fantasy sport satire boardgame?It's quite unique, and I have difficulty describing it in a simple way so I will explain the gameplayYou have a team of 11-16 pieces(Your players), and you face off against a team of similar size. Only up to 11 per team can be on the field at once. It is vaguely remniscent of American Football(Handegg for you Europeans out there), where you have a ball and you need to run it into your opposition's endzone to score. Different from the sport however is that you take turns moving your pieces. This leads to a more strategic and tactical game, with the dice-based mechanics making it mainly a challenge of risk avoidance, while maximising the risk for your opponent.Of course, being a Warhammer universe, there are races other than humans. And everything is much more violent. It is not unusual for a team to have players die on the field, or to have them permanently injured. And tactics are much less throwing balls and passing for the less dextrous races(Orks tend to not have a great catcher for one, and the passing game of a dwarf team is notorious for being poor), and more other things. Stalling, outmanouvering your opponent, or just plainly trying to beat them all to a pulp and walk right through them are options. There are plenty of tactical choices to be made, and several strategic ones as well - A team can last you a very long time, and knowing how to build the skills on your team is crucial to your success in the later matches.In the end, it is a very interesting game. It has a little something for everyone, from amazing comebacks out of a long pass by an elf team to the pure carnage of a band of orks having themselves a good old brawl while there just happens to be a ball in the mix somewhere, to entirely other playstyles entirely.While often I think of something to say that would let you know whether or not you'll like it, the only way to know for sure with Bloodbowl is to try.It's very hit and miss.  If you end up enjoying it, you can get a long, long time out of your money. And if not, well. It was cheap(If you got it on sale), and you tried. And even then, it's a great game to play with a friend while just talking or doing something else on the side. Blood Bowl Chaos edition includes all content of Legendary edition.New in Chaos edition are three new teams/races you can pick, none of them overpowered so you are not buying power here, while at the same time being 100% compatible with Legendary edition.There are extra voice lines, a new stadium, and a new price tag!Buying Chaos edition gets you all the content in Legendary as well, so you can consider it the 'full edition' at this point. (Before Bloodbowl 2 anyway)Is it worth a whole 10 bucks more? Up to you. But do know that during sales it is often available for a much cheaper price, a total of 7,50 seems to be customary.Worth it on sale? You bet it is. Worth it for everyone? As before, maybe. But I do recommend giving it a try just in case you like it. Because if you do, you'll wonder where the hours went, and why the sun is coming up already.I highly recommend Cknoor and his group for both learning to play, finding the fun in the game if you're not sure on what to amuse yourself with, and finding people to play withhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/cknoorbowl ",162,24,0,26,61,4,94

												If you like strategy and wargaming, you'll like this game.  But be warned:  it's hard, unforgiving, and frustrating as hell.A lot of people buy this game without having a background in wargaming type games, and they start thinking the RNG is broken.  I can understand that, because it can be frustrating to play well then get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked down the field because of bad dice rolls.  But that's how wargames are - you're making strategy based on the odds of the rolls.If you can get that in your head, then you can start to learn the strategies - like doubling up on blocks to improve your odds.  Making use of the special skills of the various players.  Changing tactics against teams based on if they pass, brawl, etc.It took me a good 12 hours to get the hang of it, and I've been playing wargames a long time.  I'm finally starting to win against the AI.  I played one online game, and they other player mopped the pitch with me, so I need a lot more practice.But if you have the patience to develop the skills, you'll find this a lot of fun (even though it's very frustrating).  I also recommend looking for various online strategy guides that will help you with concepts / tactics like ""The Cage"", etc.  It reduces the learning curve and makes the game enjoyable sooner.

												10/10 awesome game.If you enjoyed this on the tabletops as much as I did, it's a no-brainer.If you've never played the board version of this game it's definitely worth picking up in a sale. it's one of those quick-to-pick-up games with some interesting challenges in ""story"" mode, but the real game is mastered in the online leagues. There are a number of leagues available from the beginners league to the specialities like ""no bash"" (where ""bashy"" races such as Orc and Dwarf are not allowed entry). Which means that you will be sure to find a match to suit you for style and player experience.On top of that of course there are Private Leagues.If you have a group of friends looking to find a good fun 2-player game which runs 1-2 hours then look no further.One last thing: In some sale conditions it can work out cheaper to buy Legendary edition AND Chaos edition than it is to buy Chaos Edition by itself.

												This game is a conversion of the classic Blood Bowl tabletop game. It takes the rules that required hours upon hours of bickering in real life to being automatically resolved. This saves you quite a bit of frustration, even if the dice rolls will still make your perfect team die horribly at the game's whim. If you liked the board game, you will like this game.However, if you haven't played the board game, it's an acquired taste. You'll need to be able to accept that your rolls will dictate your fate, that your best player, that you've built up with the best possible upgrades, can die at any time, and that even if you play with perfect strategy, some times you will fail anyway. It's a brutal system, but it can provide a lot of long-term satisfaction if you have the patience for it.Note: (The game is way more fun to play with a group of friends in tournament mode)			",145,45,2,47,23,3,51

												This game falls in one of two categories: You will love it immensely, or you will hate it and wish you never played it. For starters, it has a tremendously high learning curve. I've put my share of time in with both this and the legendary edition and I'm still learning new tactics. Couple that with every single team having their own specific playing style that you need to learn to a certain degree, and you have a death sentence for a new player that isn't patient enough to actually learn the ins and outs of the game.If you can get passed that, it CAN be a tremendously fun game. There are few things more satisfying then a miracle touchdown play on the last turn of a game. It can also be so incredibly disheartening that you'll rage quit instantly. That is the nature of a game built around rolling dice though. Tragedy is around every corner.So what is it? A sports game? Sort of. It's most accurately a competitive turn-based strategy game that isn't balanced. Some teams are specifically there for scoring and making exciting plays. Others are there to break those teams and kill as many players as possible. A third type is a gimmick sort of styled team that can be fun if you can work your way around their (potentially broken) achilles' heel.There are 23 teams in total in this game, providing enough variety that if you feel like you're not enjoying the game, it could just be you're not playing the right team. For example, my favorite team to play is Lizards. They can bash with the best of them, but the skink ball carriers are more than capable of doing some miracle-esque types of plays that make things exciting. However, I can't stand playing with (or against for that matter) slower, more hit-aggressive teams like Orcs or Dwarves, as they don't bring as much of a high octane energy that I enjoy. The enjoyment this game brings you starts and ends with the teams you pick. I also recommend having a friend play this with you and not just jump into a league (public or private), as that will be good practice. It will also bring less of a feeling of angst when you start, as (hopefully) either they can help you learn OR you'll learn together. So, all in all, it can be quite fun. I recommend it, but be warned this game is not easy to play, and can be emotionally crushing if you get invested in a team only to have your star players get killed by a blown dice roll.

												It's Blood Bowl. What's not to like. Haven't tried the fancy ""Blitz"" rules - just playing the Classic game.If you're a fan of the ""real"" Blood Bowl, but can't paint a figure to save your life (like me) or have no friends (like me) or don't have time to set up the table all the time (like me) or just want to sit down and have a quick nostalgic game of horribly wonderful how-can-the-dice-always-come-up-to-my-disadvantage-at-the-most-crucial-moment-in-a-drive (like me) - don't miss out.Single player is surprisingly enjoyable and competitive - and there's hot-seat multiplayer, so you can deal out some Norse-style smash-mouth Blood Bowl on the big screen in the living room too. This is Mario Kart for people who never had a Nintendo. Gratuitous swearing, cursing, beer-drinking and Pantera-listening goes very well with this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had the legendary edition previously and was holding out for BloodBowl 2. I was disappointed with what i saw and even more disappointed with the wave upon wave of issues Blood Bowl 2 has. At 75% off I was convinced that I might as well finally opt for Chaos edition as I had always wanted to play chaos dwarfs anyway. Initially I was put off by 'made-up' new teams but the Khorne and Underworld teams add some variety that remains balanced in line with others. Rest of the additions is simply more of what we had before.....If you want to get into Blood Bowl then by far your best option is to ignore 2 and get Chaos edition of Blood Bowl 1. If you have either of other versions of Blood Bowl 1, then stick with what you've got unless you REALLY want to play one of the 3 new teams.I loved Blood Bowl on tabletop and this version of the game is the best available! Highly recommended!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I started the North American TTS League and even after giving up being the commissioner I still cast games of Blood Bowl from them.  This is a true to life adaptation of the Blood Bowl board game and will not disappoint you fans out there.  However for folks that don't know anything about the game, there is a LARGE learning curve that even single player still doesn't teach you correctly.  Here's the most recent game from the NATTS league and see for yourself:

												Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition is a fantasy football video game with the option for turn based or real time game play. This game is an expansion to Blood Bowl that was developed in 2009 by Cyanide and published Focus Home Interactive and is based on the board game ""Blood Bowl"" that is produced by Games Workshop.Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition has a great variety of game modes available for both single player and multiplayer that will keep you entertained for days providing the dice gods don't come down on you too harshly.It is however recommended that you play using Classic mode and playing using turn based due to the fact that blitz mode is an awful edition to the game since it does not fit in well and functions clumsily.There are a 23 races to choose from in Blood Bowl chaos edition and helps to add a nice variety to the teams you come up against, some races share similar players but overall there is a lot to choose from and picking what team you want to play as can take quite some time.Blood Bowl: Chaos Editions graphics are perfectly suitable for what it is trying to achieve and generally looks visually pleasing and adds a fair amount of detail into the surroundings and units, for a game made in 2009 you defiantly can't complain.On lower difficulty settings the AI make irrational moves that tend to lead to costly mistakes, while the higher levels of AI provide some challenge but you most likely will want to look for opposition using multiplayer.If you want a faithful recreation of the board game Blood Bowl this is the only video game you should currently choose to try out due to the fact that it is quite high quality and is a quite compelling experience overall.I highly recommend that you give this game a try if you like a challenging board game-esque strategy game.Rating - 8 - A must buy!           Advantages	                             - Compelling Game play                - Lots of variety- The best of its kind on the market         Disadvantages- Irrational AI at lower difficulties			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rather than going for an re-interpretation of the Warhammer table-top game (Dawn of War), this game takes the Warhammer Fantasy football game ""Blood Bowl"" and ports it perfectly onto PC. The game itself plays a lot like chess, with a turn based system in which one team attempts to score as many goals as possible (as you'd expect). The difference between Blood Bowl and an ordinary game of football, however, lies in the fact you can maim, bribe and murder the other team if you so desire, making for some intersting matches to say the least. The selection of teams is diverse, with each having their unique feel and playstyle instead of just being re-skins of the same team. If you're considering getting into the tabletop version, I most certainly recommend playing this first as it can teach you the basics of the game and is incredibly fun to play with friends. Don't enable the real-time option if you value your sanity.			",103,7,0,14,6,3,19

												BB must be judged in two seperate ways: as a boardgame, and as a pc game.As a boardgame, it is an extremely interesting, very deep, beautifully balanced strategy boardgame. The variety of races, skills, and the fact that each team's playing style, potential and builds are truly unique and different, make it stand out.The only fact that may discourage or frustrate players, is that luck may make or break a game of blood bowl. The game is intentionally made so, that anything can fail quite miserably, or succeed quite unexpectedly, if one is lucky enough. To some players this is intense and exciting, to others it is maddening and rage-inducing. Avoid, if you count yourself among the latter.In general, it is one of the most interesting boardgaming experiences one may have.As a pc game, it does have some advantages. It is pretty solid, and the multiplayer works excellently - it is relatively easy to find an opponent, and many times, even if one player loses connection momentarily, it succeeds in reconnecting. The community is usually friendly, and bad manners aren't that common.On the negative side, everything other than the online multiplayer is laughably bad. The game doesn't feature any interactive way to teach you the rules of BB - of which there are many - and you have to learn them by reading the pdf rulebook. The single player campaign's AI is horribly bad; so bad, that playing vs AI has no value whatsoever, as the computer's moves are illogical, and the team builds it uses are unorthodox and usually worthless. Blitz mode is amazingly awful and doesn't deserve looking at.Concludingly, I would say, BUY THIS GAME.But only if you are fully aware what you're getting into: a deep, complex, multiplayer strategy boardgame with a steep learning curve. Oh, and visit bbtactics.com, it will make starting up a lot easier. Good luck, have fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Blood Bowl is an adaptation of a tabletop game by the same name that was created by Games Workshop. It takes place in an alternate version of the Warhammer Fantasy universe where all of the races decide to settle their differences playing games of American Gridiron Football.Much of the aesthetic of Blood Bowl was nailed perfectly. The look of the more general races like the Humans resemble 1950's caricatures of Football players. While the more fantastical races like the Undead look like mummified quarterbacks. There's a significant amount of content in this release, with a total of 23 races. Each with their own unique roster of players and distinctive gameplay balance.My favorite aspect of Blood Bowl is it's extensive singleplayer experience that also appears in the multiplayer. If your players get injured this carries over into subsequent matches, and if they die you lose them forever. Your players also level up and gain Fallout style perks. It reminds me a great deal of strategy games like X-Com. The entire game is turn based and every action in the game is determined through rolling a 6 sided die. It is a surprisingly faithful recreation of the original tabletop game, which puts off a lot of players as a result. Blood Bowl gets frequently referred to as an ""RNG game with a mix of strategic elements"". Which I personally disagree with. The random elements to the game make the game stand out to me compared to a lot of other strategy games. Where you can have a player void his entire turn because of a botched pass, forcing you to adapt. The meta of the game as a result revolves around minimizing the amount of rolls you might have to make, taking full advantage of your teams strengths. Because of these random elements, succeeding with a plan feels much more earned than it normally would be in any other strategy game. You feel that Ork score a touchdown, you feel your team win a tournament. It all feels really good when you win. Which brings me to my criticisms of the game. While Cyanide did a hell of a job adapting the rules, the game doesn't really explain very core fundamentals. Things like the balance between the races, roster selection, and even what particular plays are more effective over others. Blood Bowl is a game that requires practice and most importantly patience. You won't fully learn the game without losing several matches and clocking in upwards of 10 hours into it even. It takes a lot of reading guides and practice to really understand how to play it. But that's one of the most satisfying aspects of Blood Bowl. To me it's a turn based strategy game that's willing to anger you, that's willing to grind your teeth, that's willing to paint facepaint on your cheeks and dump Gatorade down your throat. This game is one of the finer examples of injecting variety into an otherwise bland sports game, and it really makes you feel like you're playing it in both body and mind.One last thing to note is the ""Chaos"" edition to the game is the complete version, with more content than the Legendary edition. While you can play online with players from the Legendary edition, it comes highly recommended to get this version to recieve the full experience.			",337,42,5,36,12,5,30

												A great adaptation of the classic GW board game. With Chaos edition we have 3 new teams added: Underworld, Daemons of Khorne and finally Chaos Dwarves. Underworld are a real blast to play and with easy access to mutations can be a really visually pleasing team to play. Khorne Daemons can be quite tricky to play due to a high concentration of frenzy on their players but can really be bashy and have the best Big Guy in the game in their Bloodthirster. Overall pretty fun especially amongst friends although the RNG can be a bit extreme in it's results			",70,27,0,29,14,5,37

												My old review for this was positive. And it technically still is. Blood Bowl is a great game. The underlying mechanics are great, and Chaos Edition was, even with the release of BB2, the definitive edition of the game.Keyword was. With the release of BB2 we saw a slow downward spiral of the MP community, to the point where today, the only action going on in BB1, either CE or Legendary, is in scheduled organized leagues. As such I cannot reccomend BB1 to a new player. BB2 may be a steep ask what with the lesser amount of teams, but it's where most of the pickup MP community has gone. There also is the freeware alternative called FUMBBL, that's 2d and java based. Both are a far better option than BB1 now for actual MP.Ordinarily I would not go an remove and change the thumb to a down for a game simply because of the MP community drying up, but for Blood Bowl the entirety of the game is both MP, and has moved on to a nearly identical platform as well at that, and thus I feel obliged to steer people to those two alternatives, either the updated retail version, or the smaller, more hardcore community of the freeware game.

												I HATE THIS GAME!!!!!  why you might ask? its because I stink at dice games. I have been cursed by the gaming gods so that I only can throw bad rolls of the dice. This is why I HATE this game because it´s so funny to play and is well made, but I keep getting bad rolls so I keep screaming in my head, ""WHY THE HELL DO I KEEP COMMING BACK TOO THIS GAME!?!?!?"" I keep coming back because the teams are interesting, the gameplay and meckanic is supreme and it is easy to learn. But if you have a short fuse when it comes to dice games, then maybe you should look somewhere else (it is to late for me). for when you start playing, you keep coming back for more punishment and hopes for glory.

												Blood Bowl - Warhammer Fantasy ""Football"" to the death. Turn based game with a ""Blitz"" mode for more dynamic play. Click Here  for the most comprehensive review I've seen on this game with some play pointers as well.This game is difficult at best, can seem impossible at first and is not for someone who can't learn from a loss. Sometimes you play a team that can't be beaten - until your players level up, gain extra skills and then next time it's a different story.It's a faithful adaptation of the board game - and it's as hard as week old bread that's been sitting unbagged on the windowsill. Play the tutorial and keep in mind - players have an area effect around them - overlapping adds to your chance of success - do easy plays first - harder plays second and risky plays last - or risk that turnover.Get it on sale and you won't be sorry - but don't expect anything like football - or futbol - It's freaking Blood Ball!

It will initially take some effort to learn the rules, but once you have, many hours of ridiculously fun strategising lie in wait. It's a deep game that rewards thinking ahead and adapting your tactics to your opponent. If this sounds like your thing, buy it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like Blood Bowl or playing games with turn based strategy you must play that game, you'll love it.If you have not ever played Blood Bowl you should try with this version, keeps the spirit of the game with a great diversity of races and units, with a lot of explanations about the rules. Remember you can download the rules on pdf at the internet for free.There are two ways to play a match: classic (as the original) and ""not turn based"", I´ve only played classic one so I cannot talk about the other system.I really recommend it.

												Incredibly steep learning curve. Oh yes indeedy. If, like me, you have never played blood bowl on the tabletop then be warned, you will be smashed down harder than you have ever been smashed down by a video game. Despite that, once you get the hang of it, it does become very fun. You might even win and those wins, oh boy those glorious wins. Campaign mode is the best underdog story you'll ever see (with your team as the underdog) and story mode will test you to the point you rage quit over and over and over.Killed a bloodthirster with a skink 10/10.

												Once you get past the dregs of online matchmaking and join one of the four or five very active communities with organised tourneys and leagues, blood bowl online becomes a very enjoyable experience.This is the edition that has everything and I heartily recommend it.If you do play it, I recommend reading the rulebook (just google blood bowl rulebook). Although the game generally works very well, it's much more enjoyable when you sit yourself down to the actual rules. It's a little bit of work, but these rules were honed through years of playtesting and active experience and what has come out makes sure that every game is exciting, unpredictable and challenging. Above all it's a game that teaches one to learn to deal with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situations you can be put in or marvel at the gutsy gambles that have paid off.Not recommended for people that dislike chance as a whole; you can minimize the risk to a great amount and the winner of league is generally the better player, but the winner of a match is sometimes decided by the dice gods.My very first game my most expensive player was hit and killed by a rock thrown by the audience; before I had even made a single decision. If that kind of thing sounds like fun, this game might be for you.			",16,5,0,0,3,1,6

												BB has its bugs (still).  BB has a horribly atrocious UI (especially in online multiplayer/league management).  It may take a while to figure out how to even get to play a match.  I haven't given the real-time mode much of a chance, but I haven't heard good things.  Oh and let's not forget the single player AI is pretty terrible.  Any veteran of turn-based strategy games With all that ugly.  This game is one of my top 10 games.  I would expect most turn-based strategy players to really enjoy this game.  The strategy and depth between teams while maintaining balance is fantastic.    I suppose that happens when a game's rules have been evolved over decades.  Setup a league with a few friends, and you will find your group endlessly discussing tactics.Be forewarned!  Everyone's luck sucks in the game!  It is maddening and frustratingly awesome.  I constantly swear that the RNG gods are against me in every match.  It is a game of weighted risk management.  As your team evolves, new unique dynamics to your team emerge.  It gives every team a personality.  You will have some pretty big emotional highs and lows every time your team steps onto the pitch!			",351,93,10,56,47,8,81

												This game is a ton of fun, though it's vast ruleset can be intimidating at first.  It's based on a somewhat high level table top board game and plays out like one in video game form.  Blood Bowl is a game of incredible depth and takes a serious amount of time to learn to do it well.  But if you do take that time and understand that this game is all about managing risk, you'll find it very rewarding in a reasonable amount of time.  While it might seem like a relaxing sit-back-and-click type take on the sports genre, it's rather tense.  Building your own teams, naming the players, and leveling them up has you second and third guessing each decision.  These players become extensions of you to a point, and risking them can be difficult!  The emotional and strategic depth in this game is unlike anything I've experienced.  I can't reccomend it enough for fans of table top board games or fans who might be into a sports/rpg hybrid.I had played Blood Bowl 2 on the consoles first, which gives you a pretty good understanding of the rules and the risks involved.  This version is much more complete, with many more races to choose from than BB2. Like more than twice more.  The graphics aren't as good but this game runs well even on my old beatup laptop.  And it doesn't look bad.  The controls and interface is fantastic as I always feel like I'm making the move I want to make.  I know some of the negative reviews seem to be people who had frustrating dice rolls.  I promise that this game was never meant to be that hard.  It's supposed to be a deep table top board game at it's core, but it's not supposed require hours and hours of research before playing.  You will fail, but as long as you can understand why you fail in a rather short time you'll learn the rules pretty quickly.  I'm not the biggest fan of table top games in the world and I managed to learn the rules.  Pro tip: If you want additional resources theres a YouTuber named cKnoor who has excellent beginner and intermediate level strategy videos.  They helped my game immensely.			",94,19,4,28,43,2,44

												Blood Bowl is a game that exists. You can play this video game, if you wish. In this video game, you command a bloodthirsty team of muscular men or busty women or weird monster things or a combination of all three and have a friendly toss-about of the old pigskin with another team. Oh sure, occasionally someone's arm breaks, or their eyes are gouged out, and in certain circumstances a player dies, but these are all minor details to be overlooked.This is a turn based take on American Football with fantasy teams and themes, accompanied by an ungodly amount of violence, cursing and Big Moot sandwiches.I'm not sure what more to say. It's an incredibly fun game solo and it's an incredibly fun game with friends, and a very nice take on the tabletop original game, bringing more content to a more accessible medium of gaming. Games also don't take nearly as long and the game does all of the tedious dice rolling for you. No, the game doesn't hate you, the dice does. No, it's not rigged. No, you can't roll the dice yourself. No, it's not the game's fault that your wood elf failed his dodge and is now laying on the ground with his spine shattered in several places. It's your fault. You ♥♥♥♥ed up. Get good. Get Blood Bowl!..God, that was awful. 10/10 game though.			",75,18,1,30,13,1,3

												Make absolutely sure you're okay with a game completely screwing you by RNG over and over and over and over again before making this purchase.  Even if you play perfectly and make every objectively correct move while playing, the game will still roll 1s which will still guarantee failure of your plays.  The offline AI is flawed to make it poor for practice, because while it is brutal the only recommendations by players online is to exploit a few flaws in it that make it predictable and easily beaten rather than having you learn good strategy.Other than that, it's an okay game.  Not worth the money, though.  If you really need to scratch that Blood Bowl itch, FUMBBL.com doesn't have the uncommon bug this game tends to have and plays with the exact same rules with even more player activity even during non-peak hours.

												You would never think a game like this can make you so emotional. The joy of the double Go-For-It! touchdown without a re-roll. The Fury of rolling four attacker downs at the begining of your turn. The fear of losing you star player to a pitch invasion. The unrelenting sadness of said star player getting killed by a blitzing Orge...Sorry, got off topic. This is literal fantasy football, with everything that entails. Teams consist of Elves, Dwarves, and other fantasy staples. Wizards are hurling spells onto the field. Blood and limbs flying as teams of heavily armed and armored individuals try to move the ball down the field.The game has a handful of different modes where you can make a team take them through competitions. It also supports exporting the team you create to use in exhibition matches. Where this game shines, however, is online play. Get a group of friends together and start a league. Revel as your chainsaw wielding goblin takes out that annoying guy from chemistry's reciever. Laughs will be had, tears will be shed, and there is a good chance someone will die on the field.That's Blood Bowl.			",126,15,0,16,15,5,20

												4.5 Stars - A turn based american football style game adapted from the Warhammer UniverseI had never played the board game but was instantly impressed by this game. The turn based games can punish errors quickly but the game is won when willingness to take risks and luck come together. This is all backed up with player experience, team cash management and the risk of injury or death to any participants.The many teams can offer different plays styles from ball handling finesse to simply bashing the enemies heads in. Game play is dice controlled and nuffle can be dangerous.Overall I enjoyed slugging away at the matches and experiementing with different team builds. I made my own strategies and really enjoyed getting my skills mix right to back this.Pros -Turn based tactival gamesTeam DevelopmentCons - Punishes ErrorMatchmaking delay time			",398,237,7,71,44,6,52

That being said, Blood bowl chaos ed brings out my competetive spirit out with horns....I have join 2 leagues and about to join a third, you can take some very cheap shots at the other coaches players and if they go down and the ref is not looking he he it can be fun being mean....Blood bowl chaos ed is set in the warhammer world and this version has 23 different teams, Blood Bowl 2 does not have that many even if you buy all the DLC's But it is prettier and is more bone crushing on the tackle and block. there are several options of play for single play, story , campaign, competition and world cup, you can do hot seat or online play or local area network for multiplayer if you play on line you will have to join a league and play and that can be a lot of fun...and lastly, this game sales for less than 8$ when on sale			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Does two or more of these statements correspond to you?You dislike games which are almost entirely based on luck.You aren't prepared to spend hours on end trying to understand the game concepts.You dislike games where the AI players are so stupid that the developers made them cheat.You think balance* in games is important.You aren't good at chess.You dislike games where the only option to get better is to get your behind handed to you whilst playing online matches.You are not a stubborn fool.Then this game probably is not for you.But if you are prepared to spend the time required and see past the difficult learning curve.Blood Bowl, when everything works** is great fun!The down side with this game is that it is biased towards people who used to play the table top variant, and you gain nothing trying to get better whilst playing the AI as they're cheating with dice rolls.*Teams & players.**You aren't plagued by skull dices, or fail tackles or failing other actions which MUST work!

												Don't let the sports theme fool you: this is a hardcore tabletop-based wargame in which everything from your overarching gameplan down to the mere sequence in which you move your players can spell the difference between victory and defeat.THE GOOD+The rules are easy to understand at the basic level, with the more complex players' skills adding depth as your team progresses.+Excellent sense of progression in watching your players gain experience and acquire new skills that let you custom-tailor your team.+An amusing tongue-in-cheek universe that provides outstanding fluff to the game.+Dozens of premade teams that allow you to jump right into the action if you don't feel like dealing with the aspects of managing your own.+An inducement system that keeps games between teams of different developmental levels competitive, without completely negating the advantages of a well-developed squad.THE BAD-The game seems tailored for those experienced with the tabletop version, resulting in a rather lackluster tutorial. Though it does an adequate job of teaching the mechanics of the game, you're mostly left on your own to figure out the best ways to make use of those mechanics. You should look up fansites to read up on some effective tactical doctrines if you don't feel like learning through trial-and-error. Fortunately, they're easy to find.-Missing some of the races from the current version of the tabletop rules, as well as a large number of Star Players (special players you can hire to play for your team for one game only, usually as part of the inducement system).THE MIXED*Only marginal in terms of balance. There's a great amount of customization that lets you remain competitive, but there are some skills that are just flat-out better than others, and some races that have intrinsic advantages over others.*There's in-game announcing, fitting with its sports theme, but limited variety means you'll be hearing the same things over and over before long. Still, I like hearing the announcers, because they give some amusing anecdotes from and comments on the universe's rich fluff and history.*The game sticks rather faithfully to the tabletop rules, which means many things from success or failure on the field to a degree of player progression are determined by dice rolls. This can be alternatingly thrilling and frustrating, and although the random aspects aren't enough to negate skill, it's important to remember that nothing is ever certain in Blood Bowl.*Player turnover. Some people like constantly raising new players, while others may be upset when their star player dies. Don't get too attached to your players, because the game is called Blood Bowl for a reason.*The sheer number of player skills, while good in the long run, can be a bit overwhelming at first until you've managed to memorize what they all do and how to take advantage of them.*The many different races, while each offering unique roster possibilities, tend to fall broadly into variations of 2-4 general playstyles rather than each offering truly unique gameplay opportunities.CONCLUSIONIf you like turn-based strategy games, this is an easy recommendation. If you like turn-based strategy games, bloody carnage, and a rich, amusing setting, this is a must-have.			",398,129,9,59,26,5,46

												The dice are exceedingly unforgiving. My paranoia wants to suggest that the RNG's been messed with to have 1s on 50% of the rolls (this isn't true).  If you can put up with the annoyance of rolling 1s on every other roll and having your star players die at every turn, then this is a nice little smash up of combat football and chess. If Nuffle chooses his favorite and it's not you, prepare to lose to scores like 5-0 and 6-0.			",52,6,0,19,10,3,5

												This game is so much fun. It takes some time and energy to understand what's going on, but there's a deep and engaging system to learn here. Great for anyone who likes sports and wargames. I love all of the variation between the different teams and all of the options available to customize your players as they advance. The fact that they can get permanent injuries and die adds to the suspense.The company who makes it is shady to have put out so many similar releases just to add extra teams and looks to be even shadier in the future to make people pay for individual teams with the sequel. You might be better off to just buy this complete game rather than get bled over time as they hold back content.			",29,37,0,32,19,2,12

So Create your team, recruit your players, name them, cherish them, anguish at their injuries and revel in their successes!Obviously, this makes the game a bit of an acquired taste.

												I can highly recommend BBCE, but anyone should know its a board game and dices are thrown, so some games can go weird and you gotta love this or end up being frustrated.Everyone who understands that, is able to calculte his chances and can still laugh if dice outcomes go weird will have LOTS of fun. While writing this i have more than 2300 hours spent playing or watching Blood Bowl games that says much about the potential of having fun. Best way to play it for me is looking for private leagues and getting to know your opponents, so talking to them while playing makes it more of a board game again...The only downsides are:some connectivity issues in MP for some players now and thena few bugs never got patched outrunning your own leagues you often miss some better administration optionsBut these are few and the amount of races to play and fun you have makes it up.Since nobody knows how long the servers will run, buy it on a sale and it can still be a great catch.

												Outstanding port over from the board game to PC. I remember many years ago being in a league with an undead team with the board game. What joy i had painlessly painting my figures so they looked ubah against other teams. Then the beauty of technology comes along and i get to play Blood Bowl on my computer oh what joy!! and i must say how bloody cool it is too. Love the commentators in the game Jim the Vampire and Bob the Ogre they really bring a fun element to the game even though i do wish they recorded more voiceovers as they can get a bit repetative which does get annoying.. Other annoying thing is the Ref he does like to send players off the field even with a bribe.. Why?? i only stood on his head!! :P All in all if you love the fantasty element and warhammer style universe and want to enjoy it in a sport styled enviroment then this game is for you!!! you dont really need to know anything about american football or rubgy just remember the following:- Kick off, kick the crap out of the oposing team.. pass the ball if you want to or just get it to the oponents end zone to score.. i myself enjoy the fighting and seeing how many kills my Murdering Hillbilly Team can do in a course of a match :P10/10			",4,0,0,6,2,1,12

												Even though I'm not much into american football, this is pretty straight forward. Beat the sh*t out of the other team and try to stop them from scoring a touchdown. The more violence - the better. Nothing like breaking the bones of the enemy player and making him sit out rest of the match or injure him permanently that will affect him for the rest of the career. With good luck, you can even injure the players fatally which will impact hugely on the team's wallet and future gameplays.Only rule is to not beat the unconscious players lying on ground or use weapons... Though you can always try bribing the judges if get caught! In turn based mode the suspense get's pretty high and I really like pimping out my players with more skills and mutations. I just gave my minotaur a third arm to help him catch and throw ball better - and second head to let him see better and dodge more efficiently! ""Here comes the freak show!""			",374,90,4,58,29,6,41

Blood Bowl lets you move to multi player and begin playing others.  It has a good system for multiplayer to learn more advanced game theory beyond what the AI can teach you.  It also gives you a chance to begin play in leagues and develop longer term and more developed teams.  I love this game and expect to for a long time.			",12,3,0,4,1,1,9

												Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition isn't much different from the Legendary Edition, though I understand most people recommend buying Chaos Edition if you haven't purchased either. They have some extra races included.Blood Bowl is Games Workshop's blend of American Football and Rugby, and is a faithful recreation of the tabletop boardgame. Pick a race, recruit players, and have them all killed on the field by Chaos Dwarves during your first game.BB is arbitrary, with good strategy only able to minimize the punishing dice rolls. Embrace the chaotic nature of your plans going awry, your Catcher with Sure Hands, Nerves of Steel, and Block dying at the hands of a zombie because you rolled 3 skulls and have no team re-rolls left, and watching a Gutter Runner go nearly the length of the entire field to score.Because if you're lucky, you'll catch that little rat on the next play and break his neck, ending his career forever.Not for the faint of heart or those who care that the dice are brutal and don't care about you.For: people who enjoy NFL Blitz, watching Orcs beat down hapless Wood Elves, and anyone who can handle losing because the dice didn't go your way. Lots of fun.			",309,82,10,67,59,7,85

												If you, like me, are totally new even to the board game Blood Bowl, this might be a tricky one. There's alot of rules to consider, and the tutorial, while enjoyably short, doesn't give you anything else except the most basic parts. Going from that into the regular game is quite a challenge.That being said, as a digital tactical board game, this one is really good. I've been considering this or BB2 for a while, and eventually decided to pick this one up on sale. If you're really new to this kind of game or specifically Blood Bowl, that might be the way to go, since poor understanding how the game plays out will see you soundly beaten in the beginning. It will take a couple of hours just to get the understanding needed to actually achieve something, and if you're new to this and don't have that kind of patience, this might be something to let go.However, once the bits and pieces come together, it actually makes alot of sense, and the game plays out really well. There's some RNG involved since alot of actions, tackles, passes etc are made with dice, but there's nothing unexpected here, wich means that if you have a better than average chance of success, you're more likely to succeed than not. Of course, messing up and ending up completely trust the dice rolls, you're going to get into trouble, but as long as you have a valid tactic and execute, you have a good chance of winning games.Tactics is very important, and shouldn't be underestimated, and you'd do well to choose your lineup depending on your preferred playing style. If you want to go physical, don't pick light and fast units f.x, and if you want to play a passing game (wich really can be beautiful), pick a line for that with quick units that are good throwers and recievers. Even more important: if you realize you're better at another tactic than the one you actually prefer, run with what you're good at. I'd like to play a long passing game f.x, but I'm appearently most proficient with a tackle/running game, so that's what I'm going with.All in all, if you have the patience to get into the game, this will give you alot of good gaming time. For a tactical board gamer I'd say this is a good pick, if you on top of that is a fan of Warhammer 40k this should be a must-have. Highly recommended.			",59,11,2,14,25,2,37

												Forget what you know about strategy games. This game takes it to the next level. If the concept itself isn't cool enough for you, the gameplay will hook you and drag you in. It has a certain depth to it that I can't really explain; you always have options on how you can approach a play. You can risk it, fail and punch your computer screen. Or play it safe.... fail and punch your screen even harder. Each of the different races also change up the gameplay significantly, for example, my favourite team: ""The skaven"" are very good at dodging tackles and running down the field, encouraging a more risky playstyle. Whereas the Dwarves are good at attacking the enemy players. The team ""levels up"" by recruiting more players, improving those players' abilities and getting more services for the squad. Finally, multiplayer is super fun and you can lose ALL your friends by suceeding at SEVEN 6+ DICE ROLLS IN A ROW YOU LUCKY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!Overall, I'd give it a 9/10It would be a 10 but the RNG.... it just gets to you sometimes.(Also there is a Mobile version that's slightly cut down but basically the same thing, it's nice for car journeys)			",158,15,2,16,21,1,15

Win a cup, who cares. Win a season, yeah lets see you do it again wuss. You got a lvl 5 Bloodthirster? You had a lvl 5 Bloodthirster, Haflings are now dancing on its cold dead backside.Really the game is hard and unforgiving but, super fun. Its complicated but, simple after a couple games. Does it have bugs yeah but nothing that you can't fix with some know how (get online alot of answers there).  Is it unfair? No it is not. Its has alot of races because there are alot if diffrent play styles. If you don't play a team to its strengths then you will lose. Is it just like the TT version? No not really but there are few things in common with it.In all a good game and solid buy (even more so on sale).			",35,6,0,31,10,2,37

												I have enjoyed playing this. If you are a fan of the original TT game then you will slot right into this. The only cautionary word i would use is... patience. Your success will be bought with stunning plays, clever dummies, intelligent blocking and you will know  the joy of seeing it come together... sometimes ;). The whole thing comes down to the dice. Accept that, be aware it might have you leaping for joy one minute and tearing out your hair the next and you will be fine. Enjoy !			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Having played the beta of the original Blood Bowl when it first came out, I wasn't massively impressed with it, and left it a long time before considering again. When the Chaos edition went on sale for £5, I spent a while trying to decide whether it was worth the gamble, and it turns out it was.First things first, it's important to note that this is a dice-based game, so there are going to be stretches where you get a run of bad rolls and lose to teams you should beat, players die from tripping over their own feet and falling over, and you can't pass the ball three yards under no pressure whatsoever.Once you're past the luck-based side of things, this is a pretty faithful rendition of the Blood Bowl boardgame, albeit without the need for a mountain of paper and three hours to finish a match.Each side has their own strengths and weaknesses (although team balance is a little screwy - there's not much reason to choose outside of 5 or so teams of the 20+ available, that's Games Workshop's error, not Cyanide who developed the videogame version), and there should be a side to suit most playstyles, from 'pass it around' to 'kill the other guys, we'll worry about the ball later'.Overall, it's not going to blow anyone away, but if you're looking for a nice sports game with a twist, or you like the concept of Blood Bowl but don't have/want to spend all afternoon shuffling bits of paper, this could be a good buy.

												These devs have released a lot of new editions with very minor differences in the 4-5 years leading up to Chaos Edition and got on my nerves, but I'm willing to forgive them for it because Blood Bowl is a great game. If you like American football with slightly less violence, this game is a lot of fun. Strategy reigns supreme, you need to learn the strengths and weaknesses of the various teams and take advantage of them. For example, the Elve teams tend to be great at running and throwing the ball, able to easily and quickly score touchdowns if allowed to remain on their feet, while races like the Dwarves take the slow and steady approach to (literally) steamrolling enemy teams as they make a group push towards the end zone. Killing the enemy team outright is a viable option and some races such as Chaos and the Orcs depend on incapacitating the enemy team to make up for a lack of a strong passing or high defenses like the Dwarves. The dice gods, as always in Games Workshop properties, ultimately reign supreme in Blood Bowl. The best laid plans can still go all wrong, and that is part of the fun because it will happen to your opponents as often as it happens to you. There ARE steps you can take to minimize the impact of the random number generator though, in the form of bribes to the referees, wizards in the audience, etc... In terms of game modes you have a full season Campaign, in which the goal is to win enough regulation games to take part in large tournaments. Over the course of this mode you will draft new players and watch existing ones become better at the game, managing team finances and the players in a meta-game in between actual matches. Also ready for your enjoyment are one-shot tournaments organized by yourself in Competition mode, one-shot games called Exhibition Matches, a Tutorial for new players, and a Story Mode which has you playing with various famous teams over the course of a career as a coach. Lots to do, for sure, and if you like multiplayer there are still many active players online in the matchmaking service. Even if there wasn't though, you could still play over LAN using Hamachi or local hotseat.Overall I do recommend the game, and I hope when Blood Bowl 2[www.bloodbowl-game.com] comes out they attempt to keep it contained to fewer iterations. I doubt they will though based on the last run... The good news is that Chaos Edition is the final version of this run, so if you see it on sale and you like turn based strategy games with a lot of over-the-top sports humor thrown in, you can't go wrong with Chaos Edition. It feature local hot seat play, so even if people stop playing it online you can still play it with your friends in your own home a lot cheaper than you could by buying the actual board game.

												Still clunky in some areas, over all this game does a fantast job of translating the board game to the computer. It's a turn based strategy game that combines aspects of American Football & Rugby and is set in the Warhamer Fantasy setting. It is a whole ton of fun, and can be played alone against the AI or with friends in online leagues. Over all, I give it 4 out of 5 Mithril Spikes.			",125,69,0,40,23,5,29

The RNG is erratic, true, but if you remember the board games you play then I am quite sure double one or two skulls were no rarity (especially if you roll a lot.)Besides, the opponent suffers from terrible luck occasionally as well. I remember a necromantic team needing four turns to pick up the ball *snickers* and an ogre team with three of six ogres being boneheaded.If you liked the board game I highly recommand this game as well.

												If you liked the tabletop game, then you might well enjoy this. It has all the teams you ever knew, and some you may have missed. You can play with the rules you're familiar with (or try alternative modes of play). Can play against AI that isn't totally bereft of ability nor relies on fudged dice. Could always join an online league to go against other actual human players. Rather spiffing. I'm not sure how intuitive it would be to someone that hadn't learnt the game on the tabletop though, I suspect the range of available skills might be overwhelming and confusing, could download the free rulebook as reference to offset such issues.

												This is a hard game to recommend to anyone.  Every time I start describing the experience of carefully selecting a team, training them, picking a sponsor and selecting your per-game bribes people get excited.  Then people hear that in every match there's a chance that your entire team will be injured or killed after gaining valuable experience points.  People's eyes tend to glaze over at this point.It's the violence and death that make the multiplayer and campaign so good.  You know that every match will be brutal and chance as much as skill will turn the tide of victory.  Seeing the crowd turn on your opponent to tear them to shreds on a bad play or watching your own blocker critically fail a roll and bounce off the other teams ball carrier like the dude is made of force fields are just flipsides of the same coin.You can be good at this game or bad.  Awesome or terrible.  In the end this game is like all true Games Workshop titles.  Skill is irrelevant.  The fun is in the stories you get to tell later about the crazy stuff that happened on the dice rolls and how they played out.  Play it with friends or enemies or the exceptionally active Blood Bowl community on Steam if you like, but understand that winning and losing aren't super important.  It's all about how the game plays you.			",266,25,2,25,8,1,28

												It's one of my ""go to"" games when I get bored. It's an interesting game, but you have to be prepared for failure as the odds are amost always in favor of failing... But that's how Game's Workshop games are. To properly enjoy the game you have to accept that you might lose or that a play won't go favorably. It's definitely a game about minimizing your chances at failing, it's part of the strategy and you can use it against your opponents.Personally, I like playing the Ogre team. They don't seem like a serious team, but fielding 6 big guys really puts the hurt on the enemy team. Every injury is like an extra point in my book.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The jungle stadium looks more detailed than the old ones, and the new teams are a nice addition and fun to play.But unfortunately its only a single new arena and the teams are not well ballanced. Especially the Khorne demons are totally op. Also the full price is way to high for this. If your a fan of Blood Bowl and get a budget price, i can recommend Chaos Edition.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun! Fun! FUN!It's quite close to the board game and I am enjoying it more then I expected I would. The RNG is erratic, true, but if you remember the board games you play then I am quite sure double one or two skulls were no rarity (especially if you roll a lot.)Besides, the opponent suffers from terrible luck occasionally as well. I remember a necromantic team needing four turns to pick up the ball *snickers* and an ogre team with three of six ogres being boneheaded.If you liked the board game I highly recommand this game as well.

												A great port of the popular and well-received turn-based strategy board game which uses the newest LRB 6 edition of the rules. Blood Bowl (BB) is the game of Fantasy Football, akin to real-life Rugby (play only halts when a point is scored) or American Football, only with excessive violence, death, secret weapons and even magic. Oh, and the ball has spikes on it. The players who form the 23 types of team to choose from come from a range of classic fantasy races: Elves, Dwarves, Undead, Orcs - they're all there. Each has its own play style, so I would advise you try a variety to find ones that suit you (for me, it's Wood Elves especially, with their incredible Wardancers). Races not for beginners: Chaos, Goblin, Halfling, Khemri, Nurgle, Ogre and Vampire.Be aware: this game is based on dice-rolling, so luck plays a part. BUT there is also lots of strategy to it, from more basic ideas like risk management and positioning, to the more complex such as chainpushing and team builds/management/development (useful site - http://bbtactics.com/). 90% of the few hundred games I've played have felt like the better player won. Sometimes bad luck really does strike yes, but if you analyse your game-play you usually could've made some better decisions, too. Don't be put off by what seems like bad luck in your first few games, but be warned that this game requires some patience to get good at.  Online leagues are where this game really comes to life. The AI seems hard at first, but can become too easy quite quickly. Online you get the challenge of real players, can choose options such turn length (I would highly recommend 2 minute turns) and even make your own league! 'Naggaroth Open' league is great for matchmaking, as it has a very good community, but it's probably a good idea to start off in Auld World (once you can regularly beat the AI on 'Medium'). There are a couple of rare, minor bugs in online play (the '12-player' and the infamous 'invisible player' bug), but these are not game-breaking, and most community-run leagues have agreements about ways to get around it. Some of my best gaming experiences have been in Blood Bowl. The chaos, fun and replayablity is huge. It's just great.			",4,0,1,2,0,2,0

												Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition is a faithful reproduction of the board game. You have all the rules and teams and a big community that enjoys the game.While it did take Cyanide quite some time to fix all the bugs, it is now running pretty well and stable for years.The game itself centers around getting the ball into the enemies endzone to score a touchdown. How you do this is up to you and the different fantasy-races usually employ different methods of doing so. The woodelves dance around their enemies with grace, while teams like chaos prefer to beat their opponents into a pulp first and then worry about the ball.Rulewise it is a game about risk-management. Many actions carry a risk of failure and if something goes wrong your turn ends. So you must plan your turn in advance and start with actions that carry no or a low risk, But a bad roll of the die can still screw your plans which is just part of playing Blood Bowl. A good ""trainer"" knows that those failures will happen and patiently waits for his fortune to reverse. Still, it's a very tactical game overall and it is very satisfying to see your plans work like clockwork !No game is perfect however, so there are some cons:- To really understand the game you should try to find the rulebook online. The provided manual does not provide much help. Doesn't apply if your already a fan of the board-game, but will be a hurdle for new players.- The UI could be better and you could get better information about the chance of success for your actions. Again mostly a problem for people who don't know the rules well.- The options to modify your teams appearence are very limited. You can pick a color a symbol and choose between a very limited set of skins/models for your players. In the actual game however it makes little to no difference so it's not a big deal.- The AI may seem strong at first but you quikly learn how to beat it no matter the odds and the difficulty settings. It's good enough to train against but the real fun is playing against other people. The singleplayer can still be enjoyed for a long while... constantly winning has an appeal of it's own ;)- While the AI-commentators do have a quite an array of comments it doesn't take that long until it gets boring. Thankfully you can turn them off once you've reached that point. Same goes for the touchdown animations, but hey, you only see these if someone scores a touchdown which isn't that often anyways... and as long as you made that point you wont care.Now don't let these cons get in your way of having a good time with this game. It's really worth it in my opinion, it just wouldn't be fair to not mention them.So, what are you waiting for ? Get a team together and have a go at the trophy.It's a show of skill, of might, it's entertaining... it is BLOOD BOWL !			",19,10,0,17,4,1,22

												Blood Bowl is a classic board game that made it onto the PC. A lot of fun and just evil to the bone.Smash or even try to kill your opponents player - since a touchdown doesn't have to be scored in the beginning. If the other team no longer has players on the field, you just walk to the finish line.The PC game has everything the original board game has to offer and with the possibility to play against opponent around the world, its so easy to play games. It has a little bit of randomness and luck in it, since you roll dice to play, but a good tactic and the right decisions is almost as equally important.Choose your team from all the Warhammer nations and groups and use their advantages against your enemies.Frustration can happen since even your starplayer, you build up in many games, can eventually die, but that's just how Blood Bowl works and why its not called Candy World or Sugar Bowl.As the only two negative points (from my point of view) are:- the high price of the game (but worth it)- time consuming of it, since one game goes at least 40min and there are no savepoint during a gameI still play the board game, but the PC version is as fun and great as well			",10,4,1,7,10,2,7

												A great game, pretty much a straight translation of the tabletop rules. A great way to play Bloodbowl with friends that live far away. Do note however, that it is a dice game, with all the pros and cons of one. You can play a perfect game, be a master at tactics, but if the dice hate you, you can do diddly squat about it! If you take this game too seriously you will soon become frustrated by it, in the end it is best played casually between friends.Online leagues is where it is at and there are not too many people online at the moment, I suggest getting the game with a couple of friends and playing it when you all have time to. Also, buy re-rolls when making a team, ALL THE RE-ROLLS!			",43,2,0,6,2,1,21

												Great game of Blood Bowl.  Has all the teams of the table top and a few more.  Ive been playing Blood bowl since the early 90's and this version is better than the table top.  Works amazing with the Steam Controller.  Solo campaign is very easy, with most hitting teams a lot more challenging with finese teams.  Multi player has good action online and is a lot of fun.  Great team advancement and player development with skills improving player performance and is true to the table top original.  Inducements keep the playing field level and allow weaker teams to stand a chance against tougher competition.  Focus knocked it out of the park bringing this table top classic with its Cult following to a whole new generation of players.			",49,9,2,5,6,2,4

												What i dont get is theres a ""new"" Madden or FIFA each year but if you like some clobbering on top of your managing this is pretty much the only option except for some crappy Speedball remake.And its a good option, however this is no normal sports game in a sense but a boardgame and so.... a) The success or failure of every action a player performs is determined by a dice roll which probably (maybe possibly) isnt weighted against you but sure as hell feels like it is.b) Starting out you lack all the hard counters which could soften the impact of yet another failed roll - the opposition doesntc) The tutorial isnt that helpful so you lack info on how to soften the impact of yet another failed roll or how to prevent themIn conclusion a+b+c= Your ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥boiling and the neighbors calling the police to detain the gibbering screeching loon next door because someone failed to pick up a ball three times and then died walking a step too much all the while the opposition who is PROBABLY ♥♥♥♥ING GOD DAMN PRANCY ELVES HURT THEM HURT THEM HURT THEM KILL KILL KILL MURDER MAIM ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ GOD DAMN SHUT UP ♥♥♥♥ YOUR RNG♥♥♥♥♥♥ALT+F4Yet it is still fun somehow (must be a roguelike thing), butthe longer you play and actually win stuff the more it turns out the manager part isnt that indepth.Hiring and firing players (no possibility to mix races, also they pretty much are all the same and theres a set limit on types which can be deployed - no all-bruiser teams for example), purchasing some temporary boosters or other stuff which is in essence a chance at a reroll, thats about it. Players can level up and you can select skills or stat boosts - theres actually somewhat many but level ups are slow and a few skills are absolutely essential for the role a player is supposed to fill so youll prolly always wanna chose those.   Theres a ""Blitz"" mode which has some more stuff along the same lines along with buying equipment which is expensive, temporary and on top of that provides benefits only at a random chance around 20%  and in classic mode the player would gain the visual upgrade on a level up (without the bonus, not sure). Also you have to chose a sponsor and if you dont fullfill certain criteria they take all your money at the end of a season because thats how this works (?!?). Play classic.Theres ""live"" commentary which inevitably gets old after a while.Still a very fun game despite or more likely because of the random element..oh heh RNG dicked you over again.

												Beneath a somewhat overly complicated veneer lies one of deepest competitive turn-based games around. Blood Bowl really shines while matching wits with other players head-to-head, as a simple roll of the dice can lead to breathtakingly spectacular plays. Blood Bowl has spawned volumes of analysis and commentary across the web, and it's the elegant marriage between its teams, players, and skill systems that keeps me coming back for more. The rich fantasy world that Games Workshop has developed over the years is just icing on the grog-soaked cake.			",191,51,1,21,11,5,15

												10/10 buy it, if you're ready to learn it.Now a bit longer:I used to play this game a lot back in a while, but stopped it, and now bought it on steam sale. It is a hardcore strategy: it's unforgiving, ugly, and you do need to learn quite a lot. Yes, the graphics aren't that great, yes, there is a big randomness factor for a hardcore turn based strategy, and yes, some races are extremly below the curve. But man, this game is rewarding as hell.Once you get to the point, where you undestand basci tactics, and concepts, you can start playing the really interesting teams. The game itself has an incredible variety just from the tactics available. Add the 25 race, the leveling system, for each player individually, multi player, tournaments, single player campaign, and you can easily put in 100 hours into this game, if you ever get bored.If you don't have any other Blood Bowl game, I recommend starting here. Buying the 2nd, is a waste of money, that game doesn't deserve to be called Blood Bowl. Buying the Legendary and saving 10 euros is something, but the three races are well worth it, believe me.For learning, I recommend cKnoor's youtube channel, he made some tutorials for beginners, and has a lot of gameplay uploaded, you can learn a lot from him. He also streams on twitch, if I remember right.If you need help with starting the game, I am more then happy to teach you the basics of the game, and some of the more beginner friendly races. So feel free to write me a p.m., but don't expect me up anytime soon, I have a social life to live after all, I can't spend every minute hitting people into the ground with a team of mummies and skeletons :DD			",58,6,3,11,6,1,7

												Blood Bowl is a wonderful game filled with pain, suffering, and anguish for both your poor little meat bag pawns and yourself, as the dark god Nuffle makes your well thought out stategic plans crumble into ashen dust before your eyes as your freinds watch on, giggling at the shaudenfraidah like the cackling harpies they are! In all seriousness, blood bowl is a game of maximizing your odds of success against an oh so cruel random number generator with a fairly deep and varried system of mechanics which simulates a hyper violent game of foot ball played out by a bunch of fantasy creatures. Buyer beware though, this game's tutorial sucks♥♥♥♥♥ and if you go into this blind, you will be scratching your head as the game punishes you for blundering around with systems that you dont even know exist. Look up a tutorial or two on youtube and your expirance will be FAR more enjoyable than it otherwise would be.			",98,28,1,21,24,3,22

												I appear to be the first negative reviewer to have completed Blood Bowl in its entirety. This game has two distinct parts, the dating and the Bad Boys Love secret match unlocked by romancing every orc possible!!The first part is simply too short to be entertaining. Any match in Blood Bowl can be played in about an hour going at a relaxed pace, but there is significant overlap between matches, including sections that have no effect on the particular match you're playing, so I found myself skipping more and more as I replayed. This also caused me to inadvertently skip content I hadn't dice rolled before, because some sections have multiple outcomes but start out the same way regardless of match. There is no way to go back to content accidentally skipped without reloading or starting a new game and it simply wasn't interesting enough to worth bothering to find out why I was faced with the choice of telling that one cute Orc with the pigtails ""convenience store"" or ""grocery store"" and I could infer it had something to do with pudding anyway.Consequently, there just isn't enough time to give any character depth and there's no challenge to complete a match. By the time you finish a match, you feel like you were merely introduced to the team. Picking matches is also very obvious and there is never any difficulty in seducing the various orcs, unless you can't figure out that picking every opportunity to spend time with your desired orc is necessary to romance them. The matches I enjoyed most against Bonecrusher, Fister, and Anghel, stood out because they were simply the most oddball. For a game that is billed as an orc romance game, most matches utilize stereotypical melodrama. Orc puns and poop culture references abound, but there's really nothing laugh out loud funny in Blood Bowl and at best you'll smirk a lot. All in all, Blood Bowl wasn't an altogether terrible game, but it just wasn't worth the money and I got it in a 50% off sale. I will likely never play it again and would forget about it entirely if Steam didn't keep it in my library forever. As some consolation, the sexy trading cards were surprisingly valuable and I was able to quickly sell them for about $1000.If you don't mind a lot of repetition, love Blood Bowl no matter what, and really love silly gimmicks, then buy this game. Otherwise, pick up just about any other RnG game on Steam. Even some of the free ones are more entertaining than Blood Bowl4/ORC			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fantastic game.  A huge number of different teams who all play differently - and have different abilities and skillsets.There is a surprisingly deep strategy in this game, and the charming graphics do not detract from the specatcle (I actually like the cartoony graphics of this game much more than Blood Bowl 2 ""realistic"" graphics).All in all, get this game, and if it is on sale, snag it at once.

												It's Blood Bowl on the PC. That's almost all that needs to be said. It can be frustratingly buggy and has some goofy UI decisions but otherwise, Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition is still Blood Bowl and that means it's still a great game. Play any team you want on a slew of different pitches without having to spend hundreds of dollars on models. Be sure to install the Community Content Pack.			",297,100,8,90,45,6,108

												It's a unique take on football(American), with various Warhammer races as the teams and...blood.  It's a bit to get used to at first, but once you do it's a good time...if you have a friend(The single-player is pretty boring honestly).  It takes a lot of strategery and knowing your team well!

												Hauska ja hyvä peli! Lautapeli versio parempi henk.koht. mutta kyllä tälläki kuluttaa aikaa ja pääsee reenaamaan. Ei palijoa eroa Legendary editioniin muutakö muutama hassu tiimi lissää. Näyttää hienolta ja ääninäyttelyki kommentoijien osalta on kuunneltavaa mutta pitemmän päälle alakaa ärsyttää. Suosittelen kyllä sikäli mikäli ko. lautapeli kiinnostaa!			",77,6,3,4,6,2,8

												""Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition"" is the best value for your money.  I've played, Chaos Edition, as well as ""Blood Bowl II""  which although has better graphics and visuals, suffers in the content department.  Furthermore, if you need a tutorial, Chaos Edition, is far more detailed and user friendly.			",12,3,0,10,3,1,5

												I'm not going to say that Cyanide's Blood Bowl is a fantastic videogame.  It is, however, arguably the best way to play the board game Blood Bowl over the internet.  Fumbbl, while a wonderful community, is built around an application that experiences server-wide glitches between patches that affect the meta of entire leagues.  I respect people who play on Fumbbl, and in many ways prefer the simple sprite-based interface.  However, Chaos Edition includes a tutorial and single player modes to ease new players into the game.For a time, I refused to purchase any version of Cyanide's Blood Bowl after the barebones 2009 version.  Both 2009 Blood Bowl and Blood Bowl II force changes from the source material into the core game, whereas Legendary and Chaos Edition limit these changes to an alternate mode called ""Blitz.""Something to always keep in mind is that Cyanide's Blood Bowl is not an original game, but an adaptation.  Chaos Edition is the most accurate and accessible verion of the board game.Edit: It is worth noting that Legendary Edition is functionally the same, save for the new playable races, and I believe it can even play with Chaos Edition players.  So, if you main a race included in Legendary Edition, you might be able to get by with a cheaper purchase.  Additionally, the inclusion of Khorne Demons without something closer to base/accepted game like the Slann is a little disappointing.  However, that disappointment pales in comparison to the inclusion of Bretonnia in Blood Bowl II before the addition of staple teams like Undead and Nurgle.  Granted, both Bretonnia and Khorne Demons seem well balanced/tested and were adapted (with liberties) from a certain Fumbbl format.			",63,7,1,8,1,1,11
