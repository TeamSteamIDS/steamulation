												I ve played hundrets if not thousands of hours of the non-steam version so dont get tricked by the hours played here on steam. rFactor2 is the most realistic, hardcore racing simulator out there. It most certainly lacks in some departments compared to the competitor sims but what matters the most to me- the driving experience, rFactor2 destroys anything else on the market. Its tyre model is so detailed you really need to know what you are doing in order to replicate results from real life race. This is the sim that helped me to understand how hard racing can be and showed me atleast small fraction of what real life racing drivers have to go through in pursue of victory. The rF2 community takes full advantage of the wide moddability and thanks to the steam workshop, this is now made even better and easier with everything being updated automatically. Realistic day and night cycles allow players to replicate some amazing WEC races. There isnt anything more rewarding than finishing 8 hour race after 2 driver swaps. Long races is where all the features of rF2 come to life. If you are here just for a 10 lap quickies, rF2 is not going to shine as much as on realistic race lenghs.Combining the fact that rF2 is the most pure and raw hardcore experience available with the fact that Image Space Inc are not bunch of profit seeking leeches, rF2 is a nobrainer.All new content released by ISI is free for all people already own rF2, no paid DLCs, no microtransactions.Love this sim.

												Confession of an Assetto Corsa fanboy...Rf2 is the better simulation. If you love racing it's a must buy. Quick pros and cons+ The tire physics and force feedback is the best I've felt in any racing game. You really feel connected to your car and the track.+ The AI in Rf2 is fun to race with..my internet is crap so multiplayer is not an option for me.+ Graphics look great imo, Assetto is the better looking game but Rf2 is not ugly..make sure to turn the HDR on+ Performance with AMD cards have greatly improved since a year ago. My 7990 hd system can run 20 cars at steady 60fps now with all settings turned up. A year ago it was unplayable with constant stuttering. + Good variety of cars...from a 60s grandprix car to a modern stock car.+AC cobra...OMG the cobra in RF2 is AMAZING...way better than Assetto's.+Sounds overall is great esp the AC cobra...however some cars sound a bit weak like the NSX+New content regularly and not DLC-Loading times...wtf ISI sometimes it take a full 2 mins to start a race..unacceptable. -Not enough licensed content..No Ferrari! :(-Not enough road cars-Huge difference in the quality of tracks...Lime rock park looks terrible compared to Spa 66.-Hard to find good mod content...community not as active as Rf1.-No DLC? Maybe a good idea to have quality cars/tracks for paid DLC-Takes a lot of fiddling with the options to get it to run and look great.-No documentation..will be confusing for new players-Menu system is not pretty and is confusing.-Sort of feels like a beta...but HEAPS better than a year ago.

												I've been playing rFactor 2 since the beta was released in 2012. I will tell you this - rFactor 2 is the best driving race sim out there, bar none. The force Feedback is sublime (with a decent wheel), the AI is the best in the industry and the overall race experience is just unparalleled. Unfortunately, if you're looking for multiplayer racing, the online component has always been, let's just say, unpopulated... The only way to really get any good MP racing has always been to join a league (of which there are plenty). Hopefully this move to STEAM will fix that and we'll finally have some populated pub servers for pick-up racing.I'll be honest, nowadays I get my MP fix with iRacing, but rF2 is my go too sim for single player racing. It's just so damn good. I'd really love to see that change now that rF2 is on STEAM. Just need to get some new players to take the plunge. Pretty decent modding scene as well, that's only getting better.Fair warning, rFactor 2 does take a pretty beastly rig to run and is really only truly enjoyed with a decent FFB wheel and pedal set. This is not one for the hand-me-down old laptop users. For those I'd recommend rF1/GTR 2/Game Stock Car.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After owning pretty much most sims in the market - I was skeptical about this one- especially after trying the demo-But i kept hearing good things about it and the demo doesnt seem to reflect that- so i thought i took the risk and get this- Put it this way i own 100% content  for all tracks and cars in iRacing(not trying to compare) i still love iracing- but after owning this and the lifetime membership and racing online and felt the tyre deg feel on this one- i have not log on to the other sim. Its that freaking good- not gonna lie it takes a bit to learn and just like a good coffee- its much harder to grind and press your own cup vs getting nespresso capsule and putting it into the machine- but the ""taste"" is totally different - you'll know it- thats what I felt with Rfactor 2 - the real coffee that is grounded fresh and pressed properly- it takes patience to get it right - but oh boy but when its right -need I say anymore.

												I've had this game well before the steam release and let me say this: the core of this game is being a sim and I haven't found another that does it as well.Each sim has it's strengths and weaknesses, the strengths with this one is the hardcore simulation of a car on the dynamic track coupled with some of the best racing a.i I've experienced, top of the line FFB and it does this all the while not being the most friendly in the first 5 minutes. Don't flip it on, run a lap and give up. This is a simulator, you have to ease in and likely make some tweaks to set it up exactly how you want.Assetto Corsa has more drift car mods, pCars has better graphics, RF2 has better simulation.

												After getting a cheap G29 and shifter in a sale before christmas I bought:Assetto CorsaProject CarsRace 07Dirt + Dirt 3F1 2010,11,12,14,15 and 16Automobilistaand Rfactor 2Rfactor 2 is where I have found myself returning to time and again.Yes Assetto Corsa and Project Cars are lovely and Assetto especially is where the modding community are focused on with a great range of interesting cars but the physics and driving experience of rfactor 2 just brings you back.It is so challenging to master, especially the '70's stock car like Howston Dissenter, and really seems to model tyre deformation, heat, pressure and the contact patch that Assetto and the others just feel like wooden tyres in comparison.I might be being a bit harsh on the other sims and some of it might be in the mind since I know the others model tyres in a much simpler way, but once you have spent some time on rfactor 2 then nothing else is really that satisfying tbh.It's that, 'just one more try' scenario, trying to get the last bit out of the tyres and track.I spent so long practicing on one track that the sun set and the track light came on! Really suprised that this is not more popular.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Played time only shows the Steam version but I have plenty of time in rFactor 2. It is, far and away, the most realistic racing experience you will find. It also has some of the most fun and interesting AI to race against as well as some really major racing leagues that utilize it. Now that it is on steam, with Workshop support, it should be even easier to maintain mods and updates than ever before. At the (current) discount of 40% off, it is basically a no brainer to grab the lifetime subscriptions for just $51. Even at $85 it was well worth the asking price. If you like realistic racing games you owe it to yourself to at least try rFactor2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Currently the best racing simulator on the market for physics, ffb, A.I and dynamic track/weather. Definitely not the best for graphics, multiplayer or usability. Hopefully the online component will improve when the U.I gets updated and is a bit more user friendly. The driving model has a pretty steep learning curve, but once you put in the hours you'll discover the depth of the physics engine comapred to other titles. I've read the usual 'not enough grip' comments, and they are based on ignorance. It's been said before but I'll say it again - you REALLY need to wait for the tires to warm up, and then for the track surface to become 'rubbered in'. Once you do that there's plenty of grip, provided you don't just mindlessly crank the steering into the corner carrying way too much speed. You must be smooth with the steering and have the front tires pointed in the right direction (sounds obvious but takes practice), and be very gentle on the throttle mid corner. Look at the speedo and realize how fast you are traveling before you conclude that there isn't enough grip. The ffb is the benchmark in the genre, though it takes quite a while to tweak it to your liking. I've read comments such as 'too much vibration' or 'too much rattling'. This is caused by two things, firstly a flat spotted tire from a lock up, secondly, rF2's ffb is extremely detailed and some consumer wheels (such as the G27) can't handle it - this isn't a problem, simply turn up the 'smoothing' and it's fine. A.I is fantastic to race against, provided you know racing etiquette and are respectful of the A.I's track position. They will race you hard, overtake, and defend thier position. Not perfect by any stretch, but agian, the best in the business. Leans heavily toward racing cars as far as content goes, though the road cars included are great.Objectively the most advanced physics and tire model.Ultimately it comes down to this - if you have time, patience, the ability to focus, and enough intelligence to understand the dynamics of car handling, this is the most harcore racing experience and is the sim for you. It will feel totally different from what you are used to, but give it time and you'll see why this is the sim of choice for the most serious racers. If you're just after quick fun, go buy another game, this will be an exercise in frustration.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Update V2, A call to arms: Just to update everyone: rFactor 2 is still better than Assetto Corsa, and both the iRacing and rFactor 2 fanbases need to get journalist to not just talk about the ""pretty games"". Seriously, IGN still has the release date for this listed as TBA. Like, wtf is that. Even I have more respect for rF2 than that! :(Update: I stand by my initial review, which has remained unchanged below. However, while I don't recommend the game in it's current state as something for the starting user, if you love racing I highly recommend you buy it anyways! The game offers one of the best physics engines, if not the best, in the industry, and supporting ISI will only make the entire game better in the future. It gets updated often and already has an amazing feature set. The issues I have with the game can only be improved with time and support!I've also updated my thoughts on Force Feedback and explained what I ment by ""faked effects"", as I do not believe other users realized I was speaking about the vibration effects that cannot be done realistically by most current hardware. I also am cleaning up the pros and cons to give a much more concise list of positives and negatives. Again, please support ISI and buy this game if you love racing, but please do your research if you haven't played many racing sims and your experience is limited to Need for Speed and Project Cars.Pros:Amazing physicsMod supportCustom Rule pluginsDay/Night CyclesRainAI is uncomparable to any other game. (I swear one stayed stopped on the side of the road until after a set of cars passed after it spun out!)Cons:Physics are not 100% perfect despite anyone's comments. Rubber buildup isn't perfect, and the damage model is lacking (heavily lacking. Some cars don't even get damaged visually)Sounds are strangeUnoptimized graphics systemRain does not appear on car/windshieldNot all the cars are kept up to datePoor mulitplayer system (great for leagues, sucks for public racing)rFactor 2 is a fantastic sim for a cost-saving consumer, offering more in physics compared to Assetto Corsa or Project Cars. Rubber builds up pretty realistically, tracks made directly by ISI are gorgeous, and many of the mods are fantastic.It's great in league settings and playing against AI, but unfortunately that's where my excitement about the game ends. While many users may disagree with me, I feel it's physics are a bit half-baked in some areas. While it's real-road system is pretty cool, it's no longer unique and does not offer the temp-based system that a competitor, iRacing, offers. The other issue comes with the accuracy of the tracks. While it's true that, often times, a surveyed track can compare to a scanned track in terms of looks, it does not matter if it doesn't feel right. This is often commented on the mod version of Nurburgring, where the rFactor 2 version is often not accurate in terms of the bumps found on the track when compared to other games, such as assetto corsa, that uses a laser scan copy of the track.Other issues I find with the game is it's confusing UI, the outdated engine that is struggling to keep up, and the community. I gave this game plenty of chance. I played it for over 2 years and nearly exclusivly for almost 4 months this past summer [I didn't have internet], letting my iRacing sub lapse and really trying to give it a go for my money's worth...It left me bored. Without an online ranking system, there isn't a point. I don't have the time or energy to join a league, and the AI is great but still doesn't compare to the thrill of racing a human driver. While the tire physics are quite out of this world, the FFB has obvious faked effects to try to make it easier to tell what's going on, but it disrupts my driving. This is mostly noticable when it tries to make ""vibration"" effects, something that cannot be done by 90% of hardware on the market, and is ineffectivly done by the Fanatec BMW racing wheel, as most racing wheels only contain rotational FFB hardware.The only other major thing it had going for it, the real road effect, has been brought to other games in some effect, whether it's the lap-by-lap system done by AC or the real-time dynamic track brought in by iRacing. In terms of the buy-and-drive games without a subscription, the lifetime version of rFactor 2 is the best simulation out there. Unfortunately, it's plagued by multiple issues that have yet to be fixed after a near 6 years in development. I hope the release on Steam creates enough income to let them proceed faster with their development, but at this current time I cannot recommend this game to anyone but true racing enthusiasts, if only to try it out to see what's in the current competition or to those who want an EXCELLENT offline experience. As of their latest updates, iRacing and rFactor 2 feel quite similar. rFactor 2 no longer suffers from it's wonky tire physics,  and iRacing hasn't felt like ice in over a year. I can drive the stock cars almost identically between the two games. Other cars are harder to test due to differences in tracks and the cars available. It's the package itself that bothers me. rFactor 2 could do great things, but it feels their development team does not put enough effort into providing content and rely on third party creations, which lowers the overal value of the game to me.Creating a world that is consistant, that is how racing thrives. iRacing has accomplished this. Assetto Corsa is good about this too. rFactor 2 suffers solely on this issue, which is in truth, it's only major flaw.I will update my review when rFactor 2 shows the world that it is truly capable of being a place for sim racers.(Please note that I bought the life time upgrade after paying for 2 yearly subscriptions over the past 3-4 years. I want the developers to improve this game, so I gave them support in terms of my wallet. I also bought this game for 3 of my friends, because I wanted them to try it out and, again, to give ISI some support. I do not hate this game, nor do I feel that iRacing is 100% the answer either. Everyone will have their own opinion, but I hope that people do not feel blinded by passion. [Although I will admit I am a bit of a David K fanboy, but even I admit that the NTMv1-4 was garbage]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

IntroductionrFactor 2 is one of the most realistic racing simulators currently available on the market. Where most racing games allow you to plunk yourself down into a race car of your choosing and then just gives you the option to drive in automatic or in manual, rFactor 2 takes it much further.  It takes it so far that it is actually a little overwhelming when you first start playing as there is the need or at least the option to customize your car to suit the track you are taking it out on! Gameplay ImpressionWhen you first start rFactor2 you can be a little overwhelmed with all the options that are available to you while at the same time being a little underwhelmed at how few cars or courses there are. The reason for the latter is the fact that Developer has opted to integrate Steam Workshop into the game in such a way that they actually release pretty much all new cars and tracks to the Workshop itself.  This leaves it up to you to decide which cars and tracks you want. It is a good design as it allows you to personalize your experience by only installing the elements you want. Due to the large download required just to install the base game, those of us with data capped Internet can still play the base game and then just cherry pick the add on Workshop content we actually want right away. This leaves us free to download the rest at some point later on.Where this game really shines is how realistic the simulation is. Before the rubber even hits the road, there are quite a few settings for you to play with that go well beyond the standard options. Almost every car can be tuned to suit your desires and the track you will be driving it on. It isn’t simply a copy pasted feature either; each type of car has its own unique tuning options that make each car type feel completely different in game.  There are number of different kinds of cars for you to choose from, ranging from vintage and modern day racers to junior go-karts and everything in between.Once you manage to make your way to the racetrack, the simulation gets even more immersive. With realistically working headlights to pierce the darkness, daylight slowly transitions into night and back again. Most games nowadays have rain which will reduce visibility and that is about that, when it stops raining everything reverts to normal. In rFactor 2, rain actually makes the road more slippery which impacts your ability to maintain traction and control of your vehicle. Even once it stops raining, the roads remain slick until the water on them evaporates much like it does in real life. Another bit of realism is something you might not even notice right away. As vehicles speed around on the road surfaces, their tires wear down and take damage. This rubber doesn’t magically just vanish, it actually gets embedded into the road itself, meaning that as the race goes on, your traction will actually improve. Even the outside temperature impacts your car’s behaviour, so you will want to pay attention to the expected weather conditions and outfit your car accordingly. Damage in this game also affects performance. In some games, damage is all cosmetic until you destroy your engine completely. In rFactor 2, the damage you take accumulates over time, which in turn impacts your overall car performance. For example, tires (or tyres) depending on where you live, take damage  just by being used. They wear down, they blister, vibrate, flex, overheat, and take damage from your careless driving. Same with the engine, gearbox, suspension, steering column, aerodynamics, etc. all can take damage. The more damaged your car becomes, the worse it will perform. Taking trips to the Pit are necessary to ensure your car operates at peak efficiency. When in the Pit, you can even control what gets done to your car, so even that isn’t just automatically done for you. Do you find yourself overheating? Adjust your radiator grill! Tires not performing that well? Adjust the air pressure or just change them entirely! So many things to do! Visually the game is a bit mixed. Most of the game looks great, but it does look quite dated in some areas.  Things like the tires themselves are visually stunning. The attention to detail is fantastic. Even the cars themselves look great. The roadways and general tracks look fine as well. The people not so much, but really that doesn’t matter all that much. The sound effects in the game are great and immersive; it gives the feeling like you are actually there racing the car. Some of the vehicles have an odd clicking sound, as if a certain sound effect is supposed to be playing but isn’t, but I am willing to chock that up to not having a dedicated sound card.The game has its faults, as many games do, and I feel compelled to point them out. The first one I have to mention is the settings. When first starting out you will likely find that it is quite overwhelming. I know for a fact that I really messed up my settings because the very first thing it did was automatically drive my car out of the Pit (like it was supposed to) then it proceeded to do a U-turn and crashed into the garage it came out of. It did that every single time. Even turning off my input device caused it to happen. Turning off Auto-pit fixed that, but it meant I had to drive it myself (which was fine!). I did a few practice laps, finding it difficult to turn regardless of the settings or controls I used. Spinning the wheel as hard as I could, even at lower speeds, often had me careening in a straight line off the track and into a wall. Worse yet, after fixing that issue, it had me spinning out completely on a straight stretch while attempting to center myself in the lane. Playing with the settings some more made it easier to turn. Unfortunately, turning steering assist to full caused the go-kart I was driving at the time to drive out of the pit and blow past the flagman telling me to stop. It then proceeded to drive like crazy nowhere near the track, basically simulating what it would be like to be very drunk while go-karting, mowing down any pedestrians that happened to be in the fields. Stepping on the brakes even lightly seemed to make the car want to lock the brakes, meaning you had to press lightly unless you felt like drifting around a corner backwards. It would have been nice if when you pushed the pedal all the way down , it locked the wheels rather than locking it at anything after the half way point. Again, this could be a configuration issue on my part, or an incompatibility issue.Pros:Very immersive, you feel like you are actually driving a race car rather than just playing a racing gameAbility to tune your car to the track you are going to drive it on, rather than just having general purpose cars for all tracks like most racing gamesSome of the visuals are fantastic, the tires in this game are amount the most detailed I have ever seenRealistic Weather. Wet tracks are slippery and do not dry the instant it stops rainingRoads “rubber up” with use which realistically increases tractionCons:Setting options are a little overwhelming at first. You need to find a guide and do some trial and error to figure out what works best for you. Getting the settings wrong can create some really wacky gameplay issuesSome visuals look at little dated, for example, the people in the game, such has the flagman and spectatorsThis game has multiplayer, although there is a bit of a Paywall there. This unfortunately seems to make the multiplayer component a bit quiet outside of really hard core players. Mind you I did not attempt Multiplayer that much, due to still learning the game, so it could just have been a bad nightIf you are looking for a casual racing sim that can give you hours of enjoyment, look elsewhere. If you want an extremely realistic simulator that is very immersive, then look no further than rFactor 2!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1. IntroI have to write this review because I've been searching for the perfect nextgen racesim for more than a year. I've tested Assetto Corsa and RaceRoom extensively, and I have to admit: I love them, and still spend a lot of time with them.I just bought rF2 earlier this year because everyone said that it is a serious sim, and I'm a serious man.2. First impressionsTo be honest, it took some time to get into it. I immediately felt that physics is completely different here - the car is actually a living being, with feelings and a tendency for revenge (if you push her too hard). I love how you can feel the change in FFB when you change from medium to soft tires in the Formula ISI, to give just one specific example. AI was convincing too, I had some really good fights against them in the Civic as well as in other cars. But still, something was missing.3. The online experienceYes, but. The ""but"" part was that I really struggled to find online races to compete in. I'm part of a club but people seem to prefer the above mentioned titles there, so races were rare and then only with a few people.  Eventually, I found a league, and it changed everything. How? Let me explain it with a summary of my first race ending with a win in the Honda Civic BTCC.4. My first online league victoryI start from pole. I mess up, and lose P1 instantly. I have to be really careful with my tires, so I'm not pushing hard - fall back to P3. With the unsolicited help of lapped folks, I get back into P1 in a couple of laps. Ok, but we are not halfway through yet in a 30 mins race. Some people start pitting and change tires. I made a simulation before, I know it can last 30 mins, if I'm careful. It must. The guy in P2 seems to be on the same strategy, 4-5 secs behind me. He is closing, and I cannot really get more speed, or I will instantly kill the front left. Fortunately, there are cars to be lapped. In the last two laps, I have no grip at all, so I'm iceskating instead of driving. But he is on the same strategy, he can't have too much grip either. Carefully, but on the threshold because being chased, I tend the car in and it's P1. It was really hard work, I feel fatigue.EDIT: I have made a short vid of the highlights: 


YouTube™ Video: SimRacing-GP - The Rookie League 2016 - Round 1 @ Matsusaka East 

			Views: 114		

			Short music clip with some highlights from my race at SimRacing-GP.net's brand new Rookie League. 30 mins at Matsusaka East, to be followed by Hockenheim Short 2 on 24/07/2016.		

5. ConclusionWhy did I tell this? Because this is precisely what was missing for me in the other sims that I tried. That in each and every sec, you have to adjust yourself to the ever changing conditions. It's not simply about putting extremely fast lap times, it is a struggle for survival, a mutual collaboration between you and your car. And in that respect, THIS is what gets closest to what you see in the telly or on a real racetrack.So if you are not impressed by the youtube videos (I was not, for one), if you lack the eyecandy seen elsewhere - forget about them. This is really a game about the experience itself, which is, in my opinion, unmatched by any of the other sims on the market at this time.6. Further adviceTo experience this, however, you really have to try rF2 in a good online environment. For pickup-like racing, I recommend race2play, where you can get a lot of miles with dedicated fellow racers (EDIT: unfortunately closed at the end of 2016]. Sooner or later, however, you must find a league. And then your free time is gone, I assure you. A good place to start is the Rookie League organised by http://SimRacing-GP.net. Search the Studio397 forums[forum.studio-397.com] for others, and If you are there, make sure to take a look at the available apps as well. Trackmap gives you not only a map, but also real-time telemetry and timing information.

												For me as a simracer who wants to do nothing but organized league and club-racing, this is a great, almost perfect sim.From preparing and setting up your car into every detail and managing the weather-conditions, your tires, the lighting conditions ect. during races, rF2 contains all the great details that makes an online racing career very exciting :)The driving for me is the most enjoying of all the sim-titles so far, which gives the game a very long shelf-life.I'm now 4 years into it since the beta-release and I don't see any reason to abandon it in the next couple of years :)Just to clarify again, this is all from the view of a dedicated organized online league-racer, as the enjoyment of this title can vary a lot if you are looking for something different in a racing title.

												I'm fairly new to sim racing, but I can say that this is one of my favorite sims!(Note: I have about 70-ish hours logged on the pre-steam version.)The graphics are slightly outdated compared to others, there is no denying that. While graphics are an important part of simulation, I personally believe that the physics model and overall 'feel' of the cars/tracks is far more important. rFactor 2 does not disappoint in these fields. From my experience, rFactor 2 has the absolute best physics simulation out of any racing sim.I haven't actually done any online racing yet, so I can't comment on that... but if you're looking for a good offline experience, rFactor 2 has the best AI by far. I have heard some (much) better racers say that the AI is a little slow for them, but as a newbie, They are very challenging even at lower difficutly/aggression settings. I have not yet been wrecked by a stupid AI flaw....(but many times by my own mistakes.)FFB feels great. Not sure what else to say about that!Basically, if you can get past the graphics and/or are looking for a great offline racing simulation, I would highly recommend picking this up!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If people were more honest to make a difference between what they prefer and what is actually better would be impossible for them to give a negative review to rF2. When you put together the amount of simulated stuff + the quality of simulation from ALL sims you can see rF2 is ahead of any other in the market right now. No wonder why professional teams use ISI stuff. You may prefer something else for whatever reasons (like me, I prefer Stock Car Extreme over rF2). But to give a negative review for this sim would be senseless. So buy it, you won't regret if you want simulation. Yeah not all ISI decisions are good, but on the simulation part other groups just can't beat them and this won't change for a while even if they are getting closer they still have a long way to go (except for iRacing, in part...)Just my 2 cents. Or my $80. Kidding, I won a lifetime key in a live stream, it didn't cost me anything xD			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My only gripe is i never went to engineering school.. this game is so complex when it comes to settings for basicly everything.. I was reminded why i gave up on Rfactor original. Other than that.. Loving it so far. AI is pretty good! Give it a shot if you love real racing. (Mad not to at 40% off)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												ISI makes the only true driving sim engine, even some other games used it in the past (GTR2 etc.).Seeing score that Assetto Corsa has, I just need to put out here that rFactor is much better as a driving sim than AC, speaking of which it is way harder and good force feedback wheel is simply a must. Sure, lifetime sub is costly, but you will get everything that will be made for this game, AC on the other hand chargers very good for it's DLC-s.Not to mention that wheelspin/tyre grip in general is very sloppy compared to rF2. I won't even compare Project Cars which is miles behind both of the mentioned sims in terms of driving physics.rFactor 2 a ""game"" (simulator is the most accurate word) for people who enjoy racing in it's purest form and the closest thing you will get to the real deal.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a long-time fan of Assetto Corsa, I recently picked up rF2 after reading numerous reviews commending how advanced and detailed its physics are. The move to a free online model was also a big plus in my book. I wanted to experience some of the best physics that sim-racing has to offer so took the plunge!After a few weeks with the sim I can honestly say that I consider it my go-to racing title. The physics and force feedback truly are top notch. The tire model is phenomenal. The damage model is robust. The ""live"" track rubbering and racing lines are great. The day/night cycle and dynamic weather patterns are awesome, especially in how the tracks respond to rain and drying. The pitstops are convincing and well implemented (minus the lack of visible crew). And the AI, wow! It can drive and definitely give you a run for your money! It's very convincing and responds well to the player and to each other, makes little ""mistakes"" here and there, feels very alive and intuitive. The official content engine sounds, tire squeals, wind noises, etc etc all are very well done overall! I also really appreciate the attention given to the player's head movement in how it responds both to the aerodynamics of the car and the forces of the engine. The movements even blend nicely with headtracking, very cool!. Being able to race online with AI populating the track is also a welcome feature.(I could go on, but you get the idea... Big thumbs up in my book in almost every category. Almost...)The only knock I have against the title, and how I would summarize it in its current state is that it's kind of an Arma 2/3 (military simulation) equivalent of racing sims. When it comes together with high quality cars and tracks, the experience is sublime and I consider the experience second to none! But when a car or track is lacking, it's quite noticeable. The community made content can feel hit and miss at times and some of the content seems to be carry-overs from rF1. Given that much of it is free to download, I can't really complain and I applaud everyone's efforts and contributions. From what I gather it's a tall order indeed to mod a car properly for this game. Much more nuance and detail involved to properly implement all the things it has cracking under its hood. While part of me wishes laser-scanned tracks were officially implemented (AC has me spoiled!) I can honestly say that while I notice the added fidelity of a lasered track, a well modeled and detailed non-scanned road mesh can be nearly as enjoyable, especially when paired with vehicle physics simulation of rF2's calibre. And yeah, while I wish the car roster was larger and the devs collaborated with the manufacturer's directly (again, AC has me spoiled!) I can't say that I miss it much. I'd take rF2 over AC pretty much any day of the week unless I have a hankering to shred the LaFerrari, FXX K, or Aventador. Or P1. Or Mercedes 190E EVO II, the Alfa 155 TI, the BMW DTM... Or the Zonda R, Porsche 911, 918, 919, Scuderia...  Dang, that's *such* a nice roster, way to go Kunos! haha  But who am I kidding!? At the end of the day, while I do consider rF2 the gold-standard and in a class of its own, it's a great time to drive sims and rather than nitpick the finer points of each title, it may be best to just settle in for a ride and enjoy yourself, eh?I'm excited for what Studio-397, the new owner and content creator, has in store for rF2. If it can put out a few more cars and tracks every now and then (even as paid DLC, I'd *love* to give the devs some more money for their hard work!), it's good times for racing indeed :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After playing almost all of the ""hot"" racing simulations on the market right now  including (iracing,assetto corsa,automobilista,etc) this one is definitely  my choice.The physics model it's just insane the FFB in on another level too.Graphic wise could be better compared to AC, but for someone who is looking for that pristine sensation like driving a real race car, the ammount of feedback you get in this game is just astonishing .Looking forward to see what kind of content will Studio-397 bring.Keep  up the good work guys.

												   There is no simracing software out there to beat this one at the moment. Complex physics and environment model is its strengh, based on professional software used by most racing teams (rFactor Pro).   Unfortunately, it does not look so beautiful with AMD video cards.   Requires wheels and pedal set. Can be played casually, but better with skill and practice.   Its AI is a little bit better than Stock Car Extreme, so it is currently the best out there in my humble opinion.   As a typical PC simracing software, it is not polished with ""gaming"" features. No carrer or any mode to be finished. You just choose a car and a track to pratice, qualify and race.  At its best through simracing leagues.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												IT'S LESS OF A CAR GAME AND MORE OF A DRIVER'S GAMEAt first impression, rFactor 2 could feel underwhelming. The graphics look outdated, the car selection might not feel very exciting, and the tracks not that many either.However, the game is true to its sim racing theme. It's the only racing game that I own that actually teaches me the importance of paying attention to weight shifting during cornering. If you don't pay attention to your car's weight distribution during cornering you're going to lose traction (skidding, eventually losing control of the car in cornering), oversteer, or spin out due to both longitudinal and lateral forces that are acting on your car that affect your car's grip. You can minimize these forces by actually respecting the racing line. The racing line is the line on which you can maximize pushing each car to the edge of its performance envelope and this is done through applying gentle weight transfer on your car by following the racing line. Now, don't misunderstand me that I was saying that the game taught me to follow the race line. Other racing sims do that too but rFactor 2 is unique that it teaches me WHY I should follow the racing line other than to be fast. The racing line enables you to get the maximum out of your car by not pushing the car beyond the car's performance envelope, mainly by minimizing weight transfer so that your car is driven on the edge of its optimum performance. Each car has a different performance envelope but each nevertheless needs to follow the racing line to be driven optimally. Some cars have smaller performance envelopes and others bigger enabling you to make more mistakes and mostly get away with them although it will hurt your lap time. To put it short, it's a racing sim that actually teaches you how to be a proper race driver. Its excellent physics simulation teaches you the why that you don't get in ANY OTHER RACING TITLES (I own Project CARS, Assetto Corsa, and Dirt Rally). If you have a passion on driving fast, this is the game for you. Now, this is not quite the game for people who just simply love cars. This is THE game for people who love TO DRIVE on a permanent roadcourse (track). It's LESS OF A CAR GAME and MORE OF A DRIVER'S GAME.So, if you're not a 'driver' or lack the passion to be a technical race driver this may not be the game for you. But if you're interested in the intricacies of being a race driver, then this is THE game for you (load 'Skip Barber' car and 'Lime Rock Full Chicanes' track with at least stability control assist OFF).As a plus side, the game is playable with a keyboard too. Yes, this is a full fledged driver's sim that plays very well with a wheel but is also playable with a keyboard. There's a Steam guide on how you  can set up the game propely to be played with a keyboard as the default settings aren't meant for keyboard.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can recommend rFactor 2. The historic cars are so much fun! The dynamic track system and the dynamic tyers (the flatspots are visible, effect your driving, ffb and look awesome!). IMO the graphics are just right because I havent a high end system. If you set up everything right the racing is very immersive and realistic. Same with the AI. Just one con: It can be very difficult to find the right settings for a car/track combination. But the reward ... just amazing.I recommend 40% aggressivness for the AI (maybe even more).

												I have hundreds of hours on the none Steam version so do not be put off by my hours at this current moment in time!I have been professionally sim-racing for almost a year and I have all the sims, however you will never find a more realistic representation of driving a car than in this game. Especially some of the more fleshed out cars will really test your driving ability.To make the experience even more authentic I recommend you have a good steering wheel with solid FFB (Without this it can be harder to drive certain cars, especially those with a tendancy to spin out of corners!) The car setup tool gives you the ability to create setups for your car, this can go really in depth but there are tutorials around that can help you get started.The one drawback this game has is the graphics, not a problem for many people as most just want to drive, if you are here for the graphics then I suggest you look at some other games as this is not what the simulation is about.Overall, this is the best simulation available. (There is a reason almost all Formula 1 teams and other top tier racing teams use rFactor Pro and not Project Cars!).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have rF2 since initial release. At that time, the biggest issue for me was GUI and overall user-unfriendly interface. After few months Assetto Corsa came out and I ""left"" rF2. Now I added it to my steam library, checked it and WOW! It is much more user-friendly than before, new menu is great and I was able to easily find everything I wanted. I am seriously considering renewal of my online license.Physics&stuff: everything is top of the class, it compares with Assetto Corsa and iRacing. It is hard to choose a winner, at this level it is more of personal choice, because all three are top. I personally prefer Assetto Corsa, but I still respect rF2 mostly because of great dynamic track and weather simulation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have most of the top racing sims including AC,PC,Dirt rally,F1 and R Factor 2 is the best one of the bunch!  I'm guessing it's the physics and the AI that has me most impressed.  I heard a lot of negative reviews about the graphics but the graphics look damn good to me.  Ok not as good as the above mentioned but the graphics are just a non issue when the sim feels as good as this one.  That brings me to the FFB.   It's probably the best of all the above.  If PC could adapt the physics, AI, and FFB of R Factor 2 then PC would reign supreme but until then this sim is number 1.  Just my humble opinion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
