												I just stayed up until almost 2 AM to finish this game, and I wasn't disappointed. Essentially, if you love retro JRPGs, you'll enjoy this. Game play is standard turn-based, abilities are gained by exploration, there are TONS of items to pimp out your characters, and the ending is pretty solid. As far as negatives go, the writing is average, I'd say (the love story could have been fleshed out to great effect), and some of the puzzles seemed a tad glitchy. The labyrinths teeter on the line of challenging and rage-quit inducing, individual players may vary on how they feel about it. You don't get other playable characters until later in the game, though your main character is pretty beastly on his own. On the whole, I really enjoyed this game; it reminded me in the best ways of the early Final Fantasy games, and I can't wait to play the sequel!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												WARNING!KEYBOARD USERS, keyboard is currently ded, only controller, if you don't have a controller, avoid this at all cost! Even if it cost $1.94! Looks like it's fixedWhy I recommend it☑ Price☑ Beautiful tiles or map's textures☑ Nice sound track☑ Lot's of labyrinths☑ Nice storyIt's an RPG-maker game, but this is an amazing game, you get it? a-maze-ing, ahueheuheuheuehuehue, ok nvm. You get the idea of how the game function with rpg maker, so I wont elaborate.Now the cons, tl;drIt's very time consumingAfter the intro, you are allowed to roam around the world, basically your mission is to collect all four elemental stones. The thing is, there are paths that are not accessible unless you have certain items (e.g. pickaxe, someone's weapon), but the game doesn't hint you where to get it, so this make the game much much more tougher, because it doesn't encourage you to explore the world, it forces you to. Without a map, some maps are just tooooooo huge to explore randomly, most of my time, and probably yours, will be spent on figuring out where in the map you are.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
