												For the first game, is not bad. Respect - lovers of space and science fiction. Procurement Level - The default should be zero. For the victory, the transition to a new track. We are waiting for an upgrade!			",8,0,0,0,1,0,3

												Trash. Vehicle breaks within 3 seconds of playing, because i hit a wall once, or someone who started right behind me shoots me instantly.The game had much potential but all is wasted. Completely unplayable.			",34,3,0,2,1,0,1

												Non-playable garbage due to extremely clumsy controls. 3/10 for graphics. Could be a nice screensaver if you give the gamepad to a 5-year-old.			",780,210,34,100,67,9,102
