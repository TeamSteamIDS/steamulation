												After reading what this game is about, I was disappointed in what I've played and not because the game is bad in any way or form. It was just plain boring in terms of gameplay mechanic, and the simulation aspect of it all. Yes I actually just beaten this game and I banged my head against my bathtub wishing this was a more complex simulator but instead is an arcadey, tedious, and casual game that needs way more work If you're wondering why I am not playing anymore of this game, This is how long it takes to beat the entire campaign. I think this game can be better than what it is and heres why. The game starts off with you looking at the map and seeing that there are 3 Large areas you can explore in the game, You'll start in Thailand then go to South Africa reefs, the last and final reef is the Bahamas all of which is decently sized and looks great.The gameplay is about spearfishing, Aim your speargun at a fish, shoot, and watch it automatically get reeled in with camera gameplay and treasure hunting thrown in.The missions consist of the player searching for treasures around the area, look around and shoot fish or find treasures for 5-10 mins, find specific fish, or take pictures of fish. These missions will repeat most of the time. You can kill so many fish but when it comes to sharks, turtles, jellyfish, morays, stingrays and so on the game will have a don't shoot box over them. When you do try to shoot them you'll shoot AIR. EMPTY AIR, even if the game says don't shoot I SHOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO SPEAR THEM FOR THE HELL OF IT. If I do so I should also be punished for it instead such as being fined, or sharks coming back to bite me off. Something instead of empty air.The graphics to this game is quite nice and there is a good amount of fish to see and capture, the open area in the water and the underwatercave are pretty nicely done also and each of the maps are a decent size. The sound and music to this game is also nicely done HOWEVERThe mechanic and gameplay to this game is absolutely boring and unimmersive and also very arcadelike. It is very fun during the beginning of the game for about 30 mins then it just became repetitive and boring. Whenever you shoot a fish you'll acquire xp and gold which makes this annoying coin sound as if you're playing a slot game ruining the immersion of the game completely. After earning enough gold which takes about 5 mins or less of you swimming around shooting every fish you see in sight, you can then spend to upgrade 4 different things, your camera, more usb slots to take picture of fish, speargun accuracy and length, and your swim fins, once you fully upgrade all this. You'll swim at a really fast speed and any fishy you see  can easily be minced meat  basically because you'll become the son of poseidon himself. You're basically done and gold will completely become  useless except for spending on more usb slots to take pictures of fish. Hell even the picture taking mechanic is  pretty drysince all you need to do is point it as close to the fish as possible to take a picture as long as they are in the frame, the numbers also have to be 100% or you cant get points for taking thier pictures. Theres nothing in this game that can kill you except make you lose oxygen and there is nothing challenging about the breathing in this game at all, just swim to top and your oxygen can be filled fully without a single struggle, the only way you lose is when you forget that you're not diving but snorkeling.I think the game could do much better than this in future sequel. I want to be able to control the pulling of the fish in, Taking the spear out the fish or cutting the lines once I hunt them, drag them back to the boat feeling the weight of hunting. Instead of just picking up treasures from the ground with one button players should be forced to brush off the sand and figure out how to extact the treasure out carefully. Also the fact that I should be able to shoot any animal I want and in doing so will have a consequence on my gold or what not instead. If you're going to give players levels and XP in a game it should have a reason except that it was completely pointless. Right now this game has an awsome concept, but it needs to build on that concept and make itself AMAZING. I am not easily impressed because it was downright too simple, super casual.If you think I am lieing Go download the game and play it, Congratulations you've basically played 80% of the game for free.I also want to warn you guys of the dev pulling a fast one on bundle buyers which someone has come to my attention about.http://www.reddit.com/r/GameDealsMeta/comments/2e9yqd/depth_hunter_2_has_been_greenlit_get_your_steam/http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=saxg1h&s=8Long story short? Dev promised to try to get keys for people on desura etc, then turned around and rebundled game into a different name and in turn changed thier tune after getting greenlight. He didn't make a different game but took the same game and change its name so he doesn't have to give them keys. I would look up more about this company before you make your purchase in the future. This is something I do not condone from developers of breaking promises. Will not be buying anymore products in the future hell don't even send it to me for free.+Great Graphics+Good sized open area+Shooting fish is satisfying +Great amount of fish to shoot at+Sport is Extreme- Gameplay mechanic too simple, gets SUPER tedious- Can't shoot jellyfish, turtles, sharks, morays, dolphins, crabs, urchins, reefs, sponges and the list goes on- No multiplayer of any kind or score comparisons- Missions are downright tedious and boring, Find treasure, shoot a certain fish, or search out a fish with waypoints showing you directly where the fish is. Sometimes the treasure quest tells you to search in a 40km area then becomes boring as sin searching 30 mins on the ground clicking.My advice is to shelf out 10 more dollars, head to early access and get world of diving.

												There is not that much to tell about this game: it's a very casual fishing/diving simulator, in which you spend all of your time underwater, swimming gently along some nice (sub-)tropical settings, mostly reefs. The gameplay consists of either catching the required fish, or of exploring the surroundings - either by taking ""perfect"" photographs of several fish, or by searching for lost treasures. There is a small element of advancing through the game, since you gather experience and money with every catch or find with which you can buy better equipment.The main game consists of three diving locations, to which several can be added by buying the different dlc's. Every location can either be completed by fulfilling the different ""mission goals"" (which are mostly very basic), or can be just enjoyed swimming along in a free mode. This swimming, looking around and catching fish definitely has something very relaxing about it - this is the perfect game to play after a stressful day at work.But the game does lack some features which would make it more attractive - I'd love to get some more information on the different fish swimming around me, and the diving-simulator part really is extremely basic. Everything is being handled automatically, which in a real-world dive surely would not be the case. Some element of action or even tension would have been incorporated here.All in all, this is a game which offers just what it aims to do: a relaxing, nice experiencing, without any difficulty whatsoever. The Steam achievements are mostly easy to get, except for some overtly grinding ones (I don't expect too many people to spend 24 real-time hours underwater in this game).Recommended to anyone looking for a casual, relaxing experience.

												Got this as a mystery steam code expecting a big title but got this and you know what? This is kind of a personal little gem of mine now. I'm not going to praise it to be the perfect game, it's JUST a game you can sit down and relax to.Yeah, it hasn't got ""Ryse: Son of Rome"" graphics.It's not a massive blockbuster story like the ""Batman: Arkham"" series.It's not the generic fast action gameplay you get in first person shooters.It's just a beautiful game for you to explore.I highly recommend this			",138,21,0,4,30,2,14

												Great game if you want to just kill some time and relax. Music is soothing, game play is simple. If you want to take pictures, hunt for treasure and just enjoy swimming around with the creatures of the sea then, this is a good game. However, maps are small and more maps are in the version of DLCs. You have limited underwater wildlife you can hunt for and sharks don't attack. In game upgrades are all purchased with the gold you find and the credits you earn while playing the game by hunting the fish and the like. I really can't give this a rating because, this is the first underwater game I've played of this type that I can remember. I'd have to play more of them before doing so. All-in-all, I'd say it's worth the time and money if you like these type of games. It does have a few missions in the game for you to accomplish so, it's not all just swimming around in the beginning. The missions don't seem to be mandatory but, completing them allows you to unlock more upgrades.Edit: As for more maps, I have 3 maps plus 2 after buying one DLC. Not sure how many maps there are in all though? 5 maps are a lot of exploring.  So, from what I can tell so far is, 3 of the maps are mission maps, the first three. The DLC maps are for exploration. 2 more maps come with this DLC: http://store.steampowered.com/dlc/248530/I would also like to add that, all the pictures you take in game with the camera, it has a feature in your menu to view them and/or, make the as desktop wallpaper. That's cool. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very relaxing game where you are given various ""missions"" in each of the deep water areas of the world. Upgrades are available and, if you perform well on the missions (or catch enough fish or find treasure) then you can afford new things like longer spools for your spear, more accuracy, longer diving times, etc.The diversity of the things you can do (from photographing reefs and specific fish to a ""catch as many as you can"" timed mission) the game keeps you stocked with things to do as you listen to relaxing music and explore the ocean's depths.Definitely recommend, especially if you're looking for a relaxing game.

Pretty diving game without long-term motivation First I tried to play this game in German, but there are sooooo many translation mistakes - partly hilarious, but I switched to English. As I said the graphics are pretty. The controls are ""okay"". You can try to play this game with your controller, but this is hard. The assignment of keys is unintuitive. You pick up things with the same key, which you use to take photos or shoot your harpoon. The length of the story is 3-4 hours. I got nearly all achievements within 3 hours, but all Trading cards dropped after 4,3 hours.Overall this game is way too easy. There is no challenge. I want a game which is more like the diving sessions in Assassins Creed IV (+ hunting fish). This would be a great diving Simulator. I will NOT spend my time to collect 500 coins or 100 treasures, hidden somewhere on each map in this game. Same with my 2 remaining achievements: ""Spend 24 hours under water"" WHAT THE F*CK! ""Swim underwater for 100km"" NOPE!This is an entertaining Diving Simulator (for 3 hours!) Don't try to get all achievements. This is frustrating.Buy it in a bundle, or while it's cheap.6/10			",906,336,57,114,130,13,195

												Should be titled ""Being a♥♥♥♥♥♥to fish simulator""Swim around and spear fish in a little reef. Hunt for treasure. ""We've got no idea what artifacts could be down there but here's 10 very specific items you need to find, oh yeah one of them looks exactly like the foliage. No, we don't care if you pick up fifteen other artifacts, we want this one"" and generally faff about.You can't shoot crabs but they insta-aggro the moment you come around. You can take pictures of stuff but the game had no regards for composition of the photos. Just ram the camera into them and snap.Probably the biggest sin of them all though. MOUSE ACCELERATION.It's unable to turn off and it's spastic. Also, sometimes you'll run low on oxygen (The game doesn't tell you that you can surface to get more air but you can) and if the game wants to it'll insta-fail the mission but other times it'll just hover a 1% and allow you to swim underwater forever.Yeah, Don't get it. I'm glad I got a Greenlight Bundle key.			",673,155,32,92,55,5,98

												This is a very pleasing game. As casual as can be...nothing really attacks you or anything (except for those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ crabs, but whatevr, lol). Basically, you swim around catching fish, finding treasure, and taking pictures. You can automatically turn those pictures into screen savers if you like, which is a nice feature. You can upgrade your various gear as you gain cash via all the aforementioned activities. There are also quests which are basically catch x amount of this type of fish, find this many treasure in an area, etc...Essentially, the game just gives you a nice relaxing experience with soothing music and beautiful visuals, with some stuff to do to ehance the experience. You can unlock free roam via completing areas, which then gives you total freedom to just check stuff out.At this point, I have finished all the area quests, and probably will get the 95% accuracy achievemnt in my next playthrough. That said, I'll probably keep this one downloaded for those times where I really dont know what I want to play or just want to unwind a bit.Very much recommended. Probably 8 speared fishies out of 10 with a photo of a blue whale mixed in.			",2039,1022,52,316,205,18,280

												This game is very beautiful! It's not very hard (which I enjoy), it's fun and has easy gameplay. It's relaxing and a great time killer.You have missions to do, like hunting specific fish, taking pictures and looking for treasures. You get 3 maps. They are short though. Played for almost 3 hours and already finished 2 maps. Got this game on a bundle and no, it was not the reason I bought the bundle. But I'm really enjoying it and I'm glad it was part of that bundle. It's not worth the full price (at least in my currency - I believe), but it's worth on sale.I added the DLC to my wishlist. Even tought I wanted to buy it right now, I won't. It's really expensive (again, at least in my currency). Will wait for a sale. Will buy this and all future DLC's for sure.Do hope they add more DLC's and achievements. Suggest you watch gameplay videos before buying. This game is not for everyone.I'm really having fun so I recommend it!			",1417,868,47,59,173,20,153

												First-person underwater fish-stabbing simulator Depth Hunter 2 by indie developer Biart recently jumped off the deep end over Steam. The game offers players a chance to hunt for sunken treasures, swim with fishes, take pictures with fishes and, if they are not careful enough, sleep with fishes after forgetting to check the oxygen supply due to being mezmerized by the scenery.Now, if your idea of a fun underwater hunting simulator includes the incessant micromanagement of equipment and inventory coupled with graphic depiction of harpoons being torn out of the fishes' bodies, then you'll be disappointed by Depth Hunter 2.The game is definitely not a hardcore simulation, which is a good thing if you want to enjoy the underwater view, relax, and go for some carefree treasure hunting or a fish murdering spree without bothering yourself with the fact that you can't see your body or legs. The easiest way for you to see if you'd want to immerse yourself in Depth Hunter 2 is to download the demo. Go on, dive in, get in the swim of things and see for yourself if this game is worth your time and money.			",2254,865,87,235,310,22,348

												This game is nice, when you're aware of what the features are. Maybe I should start with describing what this game is NOT:- It is NOT a realistic diving simulator.- It is NOT story-rich.- It is NOT challenging.So, what is Depth Hunter 2 then? It is perfect to relax. You start your tour on your boat, you get a short mission briefing and then you start to dive. You take a harpoon, a radar and a camera with you. To be successful, you have to catch some special types of fishes, find loot on the ground of the sea or take high-quality photos of reefs or animals. That's all. When you have finished all missions in one location, you unlock the next. There are 5 locations in general which vary slightly one from another. The surroundings are nice to watch, but could have been detailed more. The underwater world looks vivid, though.As I mentioned before, the game isn't challenging - you should not expect too much; The price of 15 bucks is way too high, wait until it is on sale and you can grab the complete bundle including all DLCs for around 5 €/$.As a result I can say, this game is perfect to relax and to bowl down some simple quests while you're enjoying some nice underwater-surroundings.

												★★☆☆☆ - ""Average at best, Id give it a miss"" PROS:- Not many diving games out there so offers something different- Casual game which is rather relaxing- Lots of trading cards if your into that type of thing.- Almost a sort of hidden object game- Has DLC to expand your experienceCONS:- Poor animations, reeling in a fish is just laughable considering its the main mechanic- Frustrating to catch some fish, this provides the only challenge of the game but it proves annoying rather than enjoyable- Overly simplistic, from the menus to the difficulty, nothing attacks you either.- Its very monotonous and boring, you catch fish and take pictures with very little variety.VERDICT? Its an okay game but I can't recommend it, its just a bland game which fails to do anything well so its not worth your money.			",78,19,2,4,3,0,1

												Depth Hunter 2 is a relaxing game where you explore the fishy depths. Its like a walking simulator only for diving. Instead of just swimming around, there is treasure to find, or take pictures, and catching fish is fun too. The world feels very alive, the way the fish move seems very well done. Taking pictures is very rewarding there is an excellent feature of being able to make them your desktop as well. There are multiple places to visit for diving that have many attractions under water from ships, to planes, all kinds of things that make exploring fun. I rate this 9/10. But to be realistic, the game's price is about 8,99$/eur ",195,20,9,16,14,0,10

												It's not easy for me to write this review. If that game didn't have such beautiful underwater world, I would say that is nothing more than crap. But it has so stunning graphics and everything looks and move so natural, that I couldn't stop just looking around. This is definitely the nicest underwater world I've ever seen in video game. But this is still a game. So what can you do as a gamer? You can catch fishes, take photos and look for treasures. All three just suck. Gaming part is boring and there is no challenge at all. And because we are all gamers and we expect good games, I can't evaluate this game in different way.Why do I have so many hours in that game? Because to get last achievement, I had to turn it on for 2 bloody nights - that's ridiculous!VERDICT:If you are a real gamer and you are in a mood to play something challenging, avoid this title for all cost.But if you are a fan of sea diving or just want to enjoy really beautiful nature and make some cool screenshots, think of thumb down you see, as thumb up and take it without question, you won't regret that.Like this review?

												I am not sure whether this game is underrated or misunderstood and misrepresented.  If you think of it as a game it is probably 7/10 due mainly to its great graphics.  If you think of it as a casual diving simulator it is, in my opinion at least a 9/10.  The gameplay sends you on quests that you must finish to unlock other diving areas.  The quests include spearfishing, photography, and treasure hunting in open ocean and caves.  You also gather coins from the ocean floor as well as from the quest rewards in order to upgrade your speargun, camera, fins etc.  In my opinion the neatest part of the game is the photography.  It is fun swimming around trying to get a great pic of a beautiful fish with a background of a wreck or coral reef.  Then later you can go through your album and make them your pc background.  One of the main cons I see to this game is working towards a perfect game.  Three of the achieves are going to be a grind now that I have run out of quests and new dive spots to unlock.  Though living as far from the ocean as I am I will probably never go scuba diving.  So for 15 bucks this was a very fun experience for me.The graphics are lovely.  The music is a bit repetitive but peaceful and pleasant.  It is a great option for those who do not want their children playing shoot em ups and don't mind if they spear fish.  It is not gruesome.  The sharks don't bite.  So if you are looking for a fun dive experience I would give it a try.			",518,223,40,57,75,16,130

												It's basically an aquatic themed hidden objects game in 3D.Story / missions are trivial. Don't upgrade your radar, so that the locations of treasure items don't get spoiled. Prolongs gameplay.Tricky end-game+ is finding all the coins which don't show on the radar.In the end it's like watching fish in an aquarium (in a positve calming way).Has nice underwater locations to discover/explore (coral reefs, caves, wrecks, ruins etc.)All in all nice little game. Perfect for 15min zen meditation chill out before going to bed.Buy when on sale. Only two DLCs give you additional 3d locations.			",190,57,28,16,17,3,9

												Missions can be easily bugged and you might have to waste another 30 minutes to find things which are not there. For example, there's a quest which tells you to find a unique fish and catch it, which there's only ONE of it. If you have caught it already before the quest is active, during former quests, you will never be able to catch that ♥♥♥♥ing fish. Also, there's another quite similar example which can occur while finding 10 treasures quest. You'll never be able to do that quest either if you get one of those treasures before the quest is active.About rest of things, graphics are fine for indie game and gameplay might have been better but it's okay too. Story NONE.Edited for correcting grammar mistakes and mispellings.			",464,159,13,34,50,7,87

												Depth Hunter 2: Deep Dive is a rather interesting game. It is meant to be a diving simulator, but is more of an underwater fishing, treasure-hunting, and exploration game. The landscapes are absolutely beautiful, there are Three major locations around the world for you to explore and each has various missions you can complete. I spent the majority of my time playing, scouting for gold coins on the ocean floor and looking for relics. The music is relaxing, the scenery is calming and peaceful, this was a very enjoyable game to play. The underwater hunting aspect of the game, or spearfishing, is overly simplified I think. I would like for this to have been more difficult. Killing so many fish in one area should attract predators, but in this game there are none, taking away a lot of the challenge. The closest thing to predators the game offers are crabs. Still, it has it's positive qualities, the underwater scenery being the biggest one. You can take pictures underwater and just explore if you are so inclined. Depth Hunter 2: Deep Dive was worth picking up.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												I've played for two hours straight. It was overall pretty fun, but I felt that there were a few things that were a bit tedious or would be better if they were different.- The game is more arcade like than a simulation, you can continuously spear fish rapidly without running out of spears or space to keep fish- At one stage I spent 20-30 minutes unable to find required objects which was tedious, but otherwise I didn't really have a negative experience.

So you start in the first of free diving regions, Thailand. Each region is an large open underwater area. Within each region you will be given one specific objective after another as you complete them e.g. spear specified fish, photograph seabed, find treasure and so on. You are free to undertake these activities even if the aren't specified in your current objectives e.g. you can take photos and find treasure freely even if your supposed to be hunting.-----You have limited oxygen, running out will cause you to fail your current objective and have to restart it. That can be annoying if it was a long task, oxygen levels are easily resupplied by returning to the surface briefly. While no creatures will hunt you down and attack you, having contact with certain creatures will reduce your supply of oxygen e.g. spiky sea urchins, crabs and jellyfish. You can stay down for quite a long time i.e. 8 minutes underwater without breathing so it feel's more like you have a small oxygen tank that you can magically refill in a matter of seconds at the surface. I'm not sure that real divers would stay down for more than a few seconds or minutes especially if they are making such frequent dives. There really wasn't any challenge to managing your air supply.-----I found that I didn't really have to carefully stalk and take aim at fish while hunting. So this activity wasn't really satisfying in this way. You can pretty much spear the next fish the moment after you hit the last one and you have unlimited spears. Speared fish will be pulled towards you by the line of your speargun or vice versa depending and how big they and they will disappear when you have contact with them. There is also no limit to the amount of fish you can take and you don't need to return to your boat or anything to offload your catch. Their are certain creatures which you are unable to spear such as manta rays, sharks and those little Nemo clowns. But I basically swam around and slaughtered hundreds of fishes. Which was fun but didn't really offer any challenge.-----When I found my first gold coin I was very excited. I couldn't find anymore than that for while. So at first I thought it would have been challenging to find gold coins. However I soon found that there a actually many areas which have a fairly lot of gold coins scattered on the seabed. So I think it was actually too easy to find them and it was no longer satisfying. Also there aren't piles of coins. You have pick up each one individually and they didn't reward me with much cash or experience. Spearing fish provide with dramatically more experience and cash and it was very easy. So there wasn't actually a lot of point in finding the coins other than the possibility of completing an achievement.-----Aside from coins there are also artifacts and other valuables to find. I think the first thing I found was the 'Goblet of Doom'. I thought the idea of finding uniquely named objects was kind of cool. Unfortunately most most of the objects I came across afterwards only had generic titles. At one stage I had an objective to find 10 items of treasure around a certain location. The last items took me a long time to find and I was swimming around the same spots again and again. This became tedious, I think that task needed a time limit as some of the other missions do.-----You switch between your spear-gun and the camera using the mouse scroll wheel. I had to work this out myself. I don't remember an receiving an instruction from the game. A successful photograph requires 100% quality, which is achieved by swimming close to sea creatures at the right angle.-----Spearing, finding treasure and photographing rewards experience points and cash. Reaching higher experience levels rewards coins and at higher experience levels you seem to be rewarded increasingly more cash and experience for spearing or photographing fish and finding treasure. If you return to your boat you can purchase upgrades for your flippers/movement speed, spear gun, camera and oxygen supply. There isn't a huge selection and I basically acquired the best gear after playing for around an hour and a half.-----In main menu you can access a page that details all the fish that you have speared with kill count. Average weight and length of each fish is also listed even though they all look the same.Overall the graphics look good. I think effects used to make it feel undersea were adequate. There was a reasonable variety of sea creatures. The seascape look's nice and there you will occasionally come across sunken ship wrecks, planes etc. These don't really tend to have a lot detail when it comes to interiors. I was hoping that there would be an underwater cavern system and towards the end of my two hours game-play I found one. It appeared to be fairly extensive and maze-like which was cool.So a lot of the activities would probably be more satisfying if they were more challenging or just a bit more interesting. It's too easy to kill fish, resupply your oxygen and find coins. The greatest danger in this game for me so far was getting distracted and forgetting to take ten seconds to go up for air. If you didn't have an excessive oxygen supply every task in the game could be much more challenging. Simply giving all artifacts you find unique names and maybe some as well as making gold coins less common and more valuable would be an improvement. Overall this game was reasonable but I think it could be changed to be better.Click here for my YouTube gaming channel			",184,27,1,19,6,3,21

												This is my chill out game.When I am overwhelmed with work, life in general, or just playing too many FPS games....I play this.It's super relaxing to explore the reef and collect treasure. A must have for stress relief.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Super relaxing underwater hunting game.Beautiful graphics and soothing sound. Splash around hunting fish, seeking treasures and taking photographs in several nicely themed locations. That is very much all there is to the game. Air level warnings give you ample time to reach the surface and beyond a couple of barely damaging and easy to avoid hazards, you may swim and explore at your leisure.Achievements are very easy to collect with just one taking some time to acquire, though you may also pick that one up if you take your time with all the others.Recommend for crayon eaters, fish haters/lovers and those wanting a little Zen between games.

												Depth Hunter 2 was a surprising game that I was not expecting to enjoy. I'll admit it looked really boring and in a sense it was as there is not much variety in the actual gameplay - you catch fish, hunt treasures, take photographs, solve a couple of very basic puzzles and explore the ocean floor and that's it.However, saying that, it was SO relaxing! The scenery was beautiful, the background music was lovely and it was just a nice way to chill out for an hour or so after lots of shooting people in the head in other games!I got it in a bundle so only paid pennies for it and I wouldn't pay full price for it, but I'd recommend it to anyone who can pick it up cheaply and wants a nice relaxing break from all the hectic games out there.

												Depth Hunter 2: Deep Dive is a very fun game in my opinion. This is a lower budget indie game, but the simplicity of the gameplay coupled with the good graphics engine, makes this a decent experience.Essentially you hunt fish and collect gold/treasures from the ocean floor. You can also explore wrecks throughout the 3 fair sized levels. You can spend gold to upgrade your character’s equipment. Faster fins, a better camera, more accurate spear gun etc. Nothing too “deep” here, but it still adds to the gameplay. There are several fish types and other hazards to avoid. It’s just a shame that only a handful are capable of being hunted. I was really hoping to hunt a giant sea turtle or Mako Shark :(  Lastly, I really enjoyed the ambient music. It gave me a relaxing escape from the usual shooter games I play. You could call this game a snorkeling simulator because that’s essentially what it is (and I’m perfectly fine with that).

												You play as Scorpion and you decided to go deep sea diving. The music is very relaxing and the game is beautiful to look at, other than that theres not much here. Its a fun game to unwind with or play before going to bed. Did I mention the music? I love anything spacey or oceany and this scrathes that itch. I need this OST please. I recomend it for short burts to relax to but not if your looking for something beefy.			",648,148,16,84,51,10,99

												Pros: -Nice graphics-cool environment-everywhere you look is an awesome scenery-equipment upgrades-different mapsCons: -Not really sure if it's really worth the price(i'd recommend buying it on sale)-I know that developers tried to add another obstacle to the game so it wouldn't be so easy, but crabs attacking you and following you fearlessly like you are their biggest nemesis i think is quite unrealistic!Even though i haven't played much i find this game fascinating and worth getting!

												What in the world?You promised mi THAT much, DLC, and fun, and what i've got? - some cheap flash fishshooter. Boring around like a paralitic idiot don't entertains me. Theese upgrades, weird quests, only thing that looks FINE in this game is the chillout texture of water why going outta water. You could do so much cool stuff and You'd go after fishing planet. Geez.+at least it's not as bad as some games from greenlight.at least it got fish, duh.-I've seen many games cheaper that had better graphics and sound effects.Yeah it's pretty boring after 15 minutes.The feeling when you shot fish from 50 meters and there comes quest that unables you to hit it from 2 meters and then they take like a half of your money. not cool.The game DON'T look like on the preview pics, They had no balls to show how much NOT action rhis game containsI'm hepeful taht they'll give me my money backEVEN Fishing planet gives more satisfactionChrist, an YOU want FIFTEEN EURO for this crap - people there are like TONS of better games cheaper than that lol.

												Pros:- Athmospheric- Nice graphics (could be better but its ok)- Realistic swimming (except speed...)- Nice locations- Good campain- Nice musicCons:- One quest got stuck and I had to guess which fish I need to kill- It's repeative- You probably won't make all achievements, because till You get the last 2 You will simply get bored to death- Not too many fish (they repeat to some extend)- Didn't convince me to play it again...Overall I would say 7/10. Pretty much great idea, and I hope they will only get better.			",515,288,18,68,59,6,67
