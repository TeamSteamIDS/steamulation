								Fishing Planet when it came out was good. Early access, full of glitches and bugs but delivered a fun fishing experience. Then a few months in they started to do choices that were taking a lot of the fun away. Then they recruited moderators left and right ""with years of experience""... from where? Guantanamo? If you made an issue public they tended to try talk it away with different excuses, and darn you if you didn't settle with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t they served you. Forum ban. Haven't experienced it myself, but seen quite a few people being banned. Even Castaway_Dave, 1200+ hours in the game and probably one of the nicest guys in the game, have been banned for making a point of a huge glitch concerning weather patterns in Michigan and going into inventory and VOILA weather has changed.....!  They decided that better he goes then fixing the code.Enough said. Read the pros and cons  and decide forr yourself.Pros:- It's a fishing game- graphics... sadly list ends thereCons:- Never ending list of bugs and glitches- Staff, support staff and forum moderators are probably the most unsympathetic and unprofessional people you will ever experience in a ""mmo"" game out there. (Can be useful to experience as a reference for future games)- Forum moderators engage in discussions and tend to ban if they don't agree with you, or if you make the public aware of issues that they don't whant anyone to know about. (just a couple of examples)- Oh and if they read this post they will surely do their outmost to get it removed or otherwise respond to it in kind to these ""unfair"" charges.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Got banned from the game for playing this game a lot... Yeah really.. I found a bug and told people about it and I got banned because it means less money in the pocket of killerwallet. Eitherway check it out its a good fun game and I would have kept playing it. I made a video of the bug that got me banned and I'd link it to show everyone but the dev filed a tastey copyright infringment notice on it so it's gone. The idea here is that if people don't know about the bug then you don't have to worry about fixing it. I'm guessing the devs hate me because I exposed the fishing mechanics that this game uses to spawn fish. Basicaly there are no fish in the water and one just spawns based on a dice roll from a few factors when your bobber lands. Moral of the story here is don't play buggy and broken games by money grubbing early access devopers who only care about making money and not about making a game that works.Edit: I reached out to support about my ban and video take down.Support (sent by *****@fishingplanet.com) Using game bugs as cheats and disclosure it on a public channel without sent to the developers is and act of cheating and disrespect to developer, In your home country it also a crime.You violate the EULA in a section of using bugs and cheats and not notify developers about it.Even more, after we move your thread to bug section you start a new thread with the same links, also send them to players in chats.This behavior is unacceptable. We suggest to remove the second video from your channel, or we will need to ask youtube to take down all FP videos from your channel because of EULA violations.Me:Not sure if you are trolling me again but:""Using game bugs as cheats and disclosure it on a public channel without sent to the developers is and act of cheating and disrespect to developer, In your home country it also a crime.""First the bug was never used as a cheat but merely a way to go under the river. Second the developers are disrespectful to their community. Also I did report this bug on the forums so, no.  And again WTF are you going to try and arrest and sue me under? The CFAA? GL.""You violate the EULA in a section of using bugs and cheats and not notify developers about it.Even more, after we move your thread to bug section you start a new thread with the same links, also send them to players in chats.""What is this contradicting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t? How can posting a bug on your forums be considered not telling the developers when you read and deleted the thread in minutes?""We suggest to remove the second video from your channel, or we will need to ask youtube to take down all FP videos from your channel because of EULA violations.""Go **** yourselves. Don't worry I deleted all that trash from my channel. I would hate to have anyone even think I supported a developer like you.Also run your emails through a proof reader. Those mistakes are unprofessional.Have a wonderful day.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game is aiming to be a fishing simulator, realistic fish habits, movement, etc. It's not too realistic that it takes away the fun of it being a game. It's very different from other fishing games I've played. I'd love to see what updates they add to make the game even better. It has a lot of kinks but I expected as much.Pros:- F2P- Not pay to win, you can only buy exp boost or extra credits (earned by just playing the game)- Lots of unique features from other fishing games- Not just a ""catch & reel"" game- Easy to learn after a while- Different fishing methods- Pretty graphics/animations- Other players are pretty helpful, especially when trying to learn a new area- All DLC content are just items obtainable in-gameCons:- Tutorial is bad, by bad I mean, confusing + teaches you almost nothing- Really heavily targeted at fishers right now- F1 (help/keybinds) is messy, they should probably color code it- By multiplayer it means it has a chatbox in-game (Hopefully they're adding other players or something like that)Overall still a great game, and one of the best fishing games I've played. If you have time, want to try something new, or enjoy fishing, give the game a shot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Freemium. P2W. Broken line mechanics. Shady DLC treatment. Community sacrificed for 3D models (for some reason). Bite rates decreased. Prices inflated. Mobile-game cooldown mechanics. $100 for one year of ""Premium"". $50 for unlimited license to one area (Alaska). Lack of direction, lack of communication, poor economy management that leads to consumer punishment. Do not make in-game purchases, as it is a waste until fixed.EDIT 01/22/2017: Communication was provided freely during closed beta to ""eQ"" a.k.a. Hegert, who relayed to me they are ""Public Relations"" for Fishing Planet while in my stream.  All issues still stand other than a minor improvement in line physics (most techniques still broken).  Would recommend said ""PR"" not being snarky to players simply because they disagree with current system - as we're quite capable of 'calculating'. Especially zero, which is remarkably the same amount of money I will be putting in from this moment forward.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Could be a great game. I can NOT recommend in its current state.As it stands they keep nerfing the fish. Keep messing with the feel of the fight...At the moment it is nothing more than a ""Shoot fish in a barrel"" type game.There is no variation in fishing tactics, each fish can be caught by using 'X' bait at 'Y' spot.Also the forums are scrubbed of ANY type of criticism. Players get permanent forum bans for saying anything about the game in a negative way.My son's perma ban resulted from saying ""Ok you can go catch the same fish 1-2000 times in the same place with the same bait. Enjoy your awesome fishing Sim.""No warning or anything, so be careful what you say if you do try to speak in forums.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I put just about a 100 hours into this game, life got complicated for me so I stepped away from it for a few months. Come back to find ridiculous pay to play schemes. When I was playing intensely I set myself the goal of buying unlimited licenses for all the areas using ingame cash from catching fish which was very grindy but totally possible to do, now its baitcoins or whatever they call it to get unlimited. It had a well balanced economy, now I look at prices and my mouth falls open. The durabilty and pay to repair items is ridiculous, in the real world I have fishing rods from my great grandfather that still work beautifully with out having to ""repair"" them after fishing for a day, so I see no practical gaming reason for this mechanic. Sure I snapped a rod once in the 25 years ive been fishing, ten minutes later with some bamboo splints and string I was back to fishing. Yes I should get a new tackle bag, the one that was given to me as a kid is pretty worn out, But I think it will last me another year or two.This was a great game once upon a time, a bit grindy a bit buggy but overall I was astounded at the promise it showed and laughed at other lesser fishing simulators. I bought some real money dlcs to support what I thought would be the greatest fishing game of the decade. Now? Nope, im too old to fall into this money trap. Perhaps one day it wont be like it is now and I sincerly hope so. Until then, farewell.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This saddens me. As a real life fishing enthusiast, I was absolutely thrilled when I found this game on Steam about a year ago. It was fun, the leveling up to 20 or so wasn't too grindy (well it was, but not overbearingly), and all in all it was a relaxing game to play after a long day at work, or right after waking up and sitting down with your morning coffee. I even felt bad about such a decent game being ""free,"" so I purchased a few of the DLCs.I fell out of the game, for no other reason except for playing other games. I reinstalled the other day, and firstly found out most things have changed. For one, when I logged in, it told me I needed to repair my broken items. For the low, low price of $20,000. Yes. Twenty thousand dollars. I was in the process of saving money last time I'd played, and I didn't even have half that saved.Ok, I said, and moved on. Then I tried to go to a mid-level lake (Florida isn't technically a lake, I know) and saw it would cost nearly all my money to go there once. Screw it, I said, and went there. Peak fishing wasn't until late afternoon, so I skipped time. Well I misclicked, and instead of 4pm, I clicked 3pm. No biggie. I hit T to forward time again. There is a damned cooldown on waiting. But don't worry, if you buy Baitcoins, you can bypass the wait time! I then spent about an hour trying various baits that the game told me particular fish in that area loved without so much as a bite. When I did catch one, if I remember correctly, it was worth about $200. So, $8000 to go there for the day, and $200 per fish caught? Seems fair...That summed up where this game has gone, and it saddens me to say that I'll be uninstalling it and hoping a less money-hungry company makes a game where this one decided to abandon gameplay for cash grabs.PS: Don't worry, you can buy Baitcoins with your trusty Steam wallet and convert them to in-game cash, so as long as you're willing to spend $50 or so, (1 coin = $100, and $50 gets you 1090 coins, $10,000 to visit Alaska for one day) you can go to any lake in the game!

								EDIT: Pointing out the developer response to this review, located in the review comments below, was literally ""LOL"" then mocked my review because I hadn't played in a few weeks (you know, maybe because they ruined the game by the time I got back and there's no reason to log on anymore?). Here's another thumbs down to the kid they hired in their PR department giving childish responses to their customers reviews.TL;DR = Game was awesome, F2P, people paid because it was worth it. Now after the update, it's a freemium game complete with timers and cooldowns THAT THEY ADDED specifically to get you to pay to skip it. (That right there says enough, but by all means read the reviews and their own update log to see all the other fun crap that made half the playerbase leave since then, and you can go verify player pops to see yourself. I encourage it.)Was a good game until the new update. Update changed many core mechanics, got rid of DLC items people already paid for (they lost the items as they no longer exist in the game) and basically some of these changes, like the home lake change, got rid of things players spent WEEKS farming for. That's FARMING TIME, not while you are at work or school time.Game is much more ""give us money"" in every way now, and they ADDED annoying crap like timers and cooldowns (facebook games, anyone?) that you can, of course, pay for to skip or speed up.Basically this was a great game who people put money into because they liked and enjoyed it, and now it's some freemium crap with all sorts of gameplay additions to make it more difficult for you while not adding much to the game, but of course, you can just get out that wallet now.....Thankfully I type fast, and this only took 2-3 minutes of my time, but that is all the time I am willing to still put into this game, and just crapping on it more in this review seems redundant.

								The game is ok, but the people running it don't allow you to give help to others to find the best fish. They will ban you because of it and give any excuse other than the truth. They keep upsetting a lot of people with their attitude in the forums, short answers and lies too. Before the last update they promised more XP for Common fish and Trophy fish, but they lied and put the XP down on ALL fish types and upset the community. Now they're banning people and without warning, even though posting in the forums that people will get a warning first! I wouldn't trust them so far as to throw them. If i were you steer well clear of this. It isn't that good anyhow, well not anymore!Now this developer has the audacity to accuse me of abuse thrown at their developement team on my REVIEW!!! See people this is the sort of thing you have to put up with, a bunch of LIARS, nothing more, just plain liars. I did NOT give them abuse, I have witnesses to the fact, that was BEFORE they took DOWN MY POST IN THEIR FORUMS, to hide the truth no doubt!OH and another thing ALEX, you NEVER WARNED ME AT ALL (again you lied) you just BANNED ME WITHOUT WARNING YOU LIAR!!!!!!They DON'T like NEGATIVE feedback and try their damndest to get rid of it, they ban you if they don't like what you say, they accuse you of things that you didn't do and don't allow you to protest. Take this on board before you get into playing their simulator. HERE's PROOF;This is part of the evidence within their forum (the rest has been deleted by them);alex  [developer] 3 Sep @ 6:01pm Originally posted by spotme_2:You didn't warn me before you banned me! Why? And in particular the reason you gave wasn't sufficient. You should have a word blocker in place to prevent anbody being offended in the first place. I used a few bad words, but none were aimed at anybody within the lobby, yet you banned me hours later...All i've been doing is trying to do is help others so that they can enjoy your simulator, so basically doing you guys a favour in reality, and this is what I get? Really poor guys, really poor. And now you post this, saying you will always make warnings before banning...?Yes, we banned users without warning lately but from now we shall give a chance to correct the post prior to ban.Last edited by alex; 3 Sep @ 6:Now hide that truth ALEX the LIAR DEVELOPER!!!! YOU BANNED ME WITHOUT WARNING. That was out of order and you damn well know it, you lied on more than one occasion, and because I pointed this out you banned me from your damn forum, so don't tell more lies and accuse me on my review, that I gave abuse towards your team, because the evidence is there for ALL to see how you people are!FREEDOM OF SPEECH you liar!YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!Footnote:-Well said Nordek. If they had simply warned me instead of a ban without warning, I would simply had stopped doing what they wanted me not to do, and I would have just carried on playing it. But they went too far (especially Alex) and gave me another ban without warning from their forums because I asked why the ban, and pointed out that they lied about the raising of the XP on Common & Trophy fish, basically I was seeking the real truth behind why they banned me.Furthermore he then slanted me on my very own review of their simulator with more lies, accusing me of abusing their staff, and basically saying that's the reason they banned me and also lied about warning me to be simply polite! I've been nothing but polite in every way possible, however he took something personal and turned into something rather pathetic to say the least and certainly over the top in banning me for what can only be seen as helping others with trying to catch Unique fish. Which by the way others do frequently day by day on their simulator. Which makes me wonder if they banned me for doing just that, are they then saying they are going to ban all that do that very thing, just because they don't like it...? Seems rather silly to ban people over something harmless as helping others enjoy their simulator, which in my opinion would simply help them to grow...But hey, what do I know?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Bans should be temporary in order to serve as a reminder of the discussion rules.

This is a sign the mod does not care to give people second chances and let the commuity grow but to show off his power (in my opinion) and argue with commuity when people disagree with him as shown in the video when he refers to the commuity as Children.Honestly, it's fine for a mod to be a little ban heavy but when he repeatly agrues with people then bans people that don't agree with him it a little too much.

								DO NOT BUY DLC----------I really enjoyed this game before the update. The mechanics were great although it took ages to level up without dlc and premium. My biggest gripe is that I recently bought the Anniversary DLC that came with some great gear like the Fishfort Keepnet 660lb and lots of 6/0 spinners and lures. After the patch they nerfed this DLC (even though i had already paid for it and was using the items prior to the patch) so that the keepnet was replaced with a 440lb limit and the lures and spinners went from 6/0 hooks to 4/0 (this is just some of the nerfed items). They essentially took my money that i gladly paid for the dlc because of its great value and specific content, and stripped me of several benefits that it originally came with. This is unacceptable, a shady business practice to say the least, down right theft to say the worst. And this, folks, is how they treat paying customers. This is very unwise considering its a free to play game that relies on community support through dlc and premium purchases. Its fine to play for free, just dont trust them with your money. Right now this game holds a monopoly on the market for fishing games, but all that might change if a large developer brings out a paid game that does just as great a job without the freemium content this game relies on. In any case, my wallet is now closed to these developers. Heck of a way to celebrate their anniversary. This review will remain negative until they return the items they took from this DLC in their original glory.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I like some of the new innovations and fish, but the game mechanics are becoming much too annoying. It seems as if you guys are now doing this for money and it also shows that you guys have no clue what you're doing. You are ruining this game. We were promised boats and other tackle a year ago. All I see with every update is new DLC and garbage game mechanics. This is despicable. Return the mechanics to their oldest form, and I promise you, there will be many more players that will enjoy this game daily, and possibly want to spend money on it, which is obviously what you guys want...

								I thought the game was fine before the update. Travel and gear costs were reasonable, if you didn't have the dlc it was still a joy to play because the bite/hook up ratio was fair enough to keep you busy. Premium was/is expensive, but if you played without it, it didn't really subtract any fun from the game (you'll just lvl a little slower). What this game had before the update was large sociable chat rooms, loyal players who would pay for dlc/premium to support game, it was enjoyable, and an outstanding community. Now there are pay to play blocks everywhere, the economic system in game has changed and made everything more expensive (I thought it was fine the way it was), only 5 people in a room together at a time now, hook up ratio is just low enough to make the game unenjoyable and mundain. I used to genuinely love to play this game but it is now at the bottom of the 'totem pole' for me. Sad to see a game with such potential ruined.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								6 Months ago this would have been a completely different review. The developers of this game originally stated that this game would always be a F2P with a premium option to speed leveling, etc. Gold (Baitcoins) would never be available to purchase and were a reward for catching Unique fish. Well, I took a couple months off of playing this game for life reasons, and I come back to find this game is now completely P2W. Gold is now a purchase item. Home lakes are apparently gone, so instead of being able to set your home state and return to your favorite lake cheaply, you have to pay exhorbitant prices to travel each time that you want to go. A license that I ground for hours to obtain, now costs about $20 real money to obtain. This developer has essentially lied to their community through and through. I would not recommend this game anymore. It's not even fun with all the nerfing they have put into the game. Really wish I had never spent money to support these lying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s by buying premium and DLC. If you don't mind burning massive ammounts of time on a P2W that you'll never get anywhere with, go for it. Otherwise stay away.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I have a total of 13.2 hrs invested into this game in only two days and all I can say is WOW. If you are a fisherman in real life, or if you have never fished in your life you would get enjoyment out of this game. This game is like crack and I can't get enough! There is so much potential with this early access game and from the way the devs are constantly updating facebook, they really care about the community. Community is another point I want to hit on. Everyone that ive ran into so far is willing to help the inexperienced and I love that! There are so many games now a days with bad communites that it can just ruin anyones time in a game.

								I really hate to post this review, as I greatly enjoyed the short time I had with this game. I came back afer not playing for about a month only to find prices in game jacked up to the point it simply isn't worth playing.I have seen many reviews commented on by the developers about how money needs to be put on the table, and that you can't expect it to be truly free to play without some sacrifice. I myself put food on my table by writing software, and take it from me, people that write software in this manner do not mean well. They think that you are a sucker, and if you continue to give money as they reduce functionality, then you are what they think you are and you deserve what you get.The only way to change the outcome is to uninstall. Without a decent player count, the money supply is cut off. They have two choices at that point: cut bait and move on to another cash grab, or restore gameplay to a decent state.I will gladly change this to a positive review if the devs come to their senses, but I doubt it will happen. Devs rarely change tact if they have a cash grab on their hands. Hard to change your spots once they have been seen.Oh well, it was fun while it lasted. You guys actually do have decent chops at making a solid fishing game. Shame you squandered it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I reviewed this title a while back, and while I didn't recommend it then I was too leniant on its cons as I really wanted the title to succeed, and I believed in the developers.It is also a good looking title, and feels good in many ways.I dont believe anymore, the developers are frustratingly similiar to politicians, they react to positive posts that are 'harmless' but completely ignore any serious questions, like ...- Why is the drag setting so limited ? 7 Settings only (0 - 6) ?- Why does heavier tackle struggle to cope with small fish ? A 0.7 kg smallmouth redlining a 9.1k line on a 10.5 kg reel on a heavy rod ? At half drag setting ?- What EXACTLY does the message 'Fish tried to bite and escaped'  ? Specualtion is , hook size is wrong but that doesnt make sense as the same hook can catch a 5.1 kg striper and a 0.9 kg smallmouth , so what fish is struggling to take that hook ?These questions could be easily answered and the whole debacle put away for good, but no answer.There is also the unrealistic mechanics in place, like...- Catching 'uniques' , you dont just fish away and have a 'whopper' take your bait... nope you check online videos or lists, or your own excel spreadsheets for 'proper timing and rigs' and fast forward time to the 'correct window' and for an in game hour or two you try catch 'uniques'. You cant be patiant as the time is ticking away, the window is small and the in game time is accellerated.- The game gives you charts that show when the fish activity is at its highest, but that doesnt include 'uniques' , outside that particular window they are close for business utterly.- The game has 2 types of in game stores to buy tackle and baits, the megastore that has everything but you cant use it when at a fishing location, you have to leave the location and then access the megastore, and the pay travel to return to your fishing location. There are store local to the fishing location but they make no sense, more often than not they will not stock the bait you need for that location (Wax Worms for Sunfish in Cali - not in the Cali shop).- Hope you dont like catfish or panfish, they aint worth a damn according to this game, nope you need to catch bass, pike and Salmon for any decent exp and rewards.- Physics are mess, the fish will be staring at the sky with thier tails facing the bottom yet pulling on your line while being dragged sideways while the fish is in a vertical posture. You will often need to drag fish through the ground, your rod will attempt to use ninja clone techniques while fishing (double rods) and your fisherman will often reveal that they are blue aliens when the skin colour 'washes' off.Defenders of the title will pull out the old Early Access defence, yet  the title has 4 current DLC packs and has had 2 event DLC packs, 6 DLC packs since August, yet the title has numerous mechanical faults which have been brought up pre-early access during its close beta period, and not addressed.Looks good, feels good but is not a very good simulator. the more time you invest the harder it gets to ignore the cracks but the developers seem to be staring at stars if you look at their 'roadmap' ... cars, boats, houses, worldwide locations, customisable avatars... they havent even got the basics down yet, nor even added features that should of been in place long ago like quests and tournaments.It is the better fishing sim, but in a rather limited race and with very poor competitors its hardly much of a endorsement. Try it out but dont expect much in terms of simulation... its a casual feels good looks good arcade game, with some bare minimal simulation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								Edit on January 19th (original review done in response to the first update of the 0.7.0 beta):The devs are beginning to tweak some things and do bug fixes. This is a good sign. While I still have issues I listed below, I'm happy to see devs working on things like line physics, astronomical prices, gear balancing, and other bugs. Check out DIscussions for info.Edit Feb 20, 2017: Short summary of game status: The ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game economy is starting to feel like Cold War era dropping sad lonely rubles into a rusted coffee can to take down to buy my loaf of stale bread and 12 pieces of toilet paper every week in my holey fishing outfit I can't afford to repair. 0.7.0 Beta pre-release review (early Jan 2017): Cons: I really enjoyed the game but the game is now being updated and features special currency (""baitcoin""...) that effectively locks the good gear behind real money. The normal game currency is becoming severely devalued to the point where 10x increased cost is the new normal. This equates to a grind to catch all the fish you need to pay down the 10x travel costs, the 10x daily access fee, the 10x daily fishing license, then make 10x a profit after that to afford all the average gear upgrades so you can then pay the next 10x travel cost, 10x daily access fee and 10x license to go to a better location suitable to your level, so that you don't sink yourself into a cash and experience hole by staying in a low-level area. Yaaay.Avatars have been added to the game, but no way to disable them so you can't quietly fish without several others standing on top of you, nor are you able to do anything about someone using their avatar to block you. You have to move and hope they don't follow you, or leave the map and lose the enormous fees you paid to fish there. Because of the avatars, the room size has been shrunk down from 20 to 5, so the fun, social aspect of the game is currently, for me at least, not there anymore. The game mechanics for the rod, reel and tackle have changed in such a way that lures hit the water surface like a brick, lines are so fine they're difficult to control, setting the hook on a bite will jerk the fish out of the water and send it flying way overhead. There's also something called a pond pass which also costs real money. You can, of course, also buy baitcoin with real currency to have access to the associated perks in the game.Current players who have shelled out over the past year+ with time, money, purchase of DLC to support development of this early access game, are in the dark about what the plan is to convert their current bank, gear, purchased content, and time invested. There's been comments but no official announcement, and the release of the beta is supposedly now only a couple of days away. I'd have loved to shell out a monthly subscription fee for this game without all the b.o.l.l.o.c.k.s. they're adding in. Even the premiere level which you buy with real money costs additional real money for baitcoin.Pros: Looks like some of the graphics got a touch-up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I'll start this off with saying I do like the game despite its problems and slow update pattern. But as it stands with the long list of bugs/glitches and slow updates I cannot recommend the game as-is until a more realistic update schedule is put in place. However despite the game, that is not the problem nor is it the main concern I have about the future of the game... Its the forum moderator that is ultimately killing the community from the inside by deleting and even banning people for posting anything even remotely negative or critical. I'll tell you about my experience, and you can make up your own assumptions. This has been going on for a long time now and people have noticed how bad the power-trip of FlaGuitars has gotten over the last 6 months. There is even YouTube videos coming from reputable tubers about the community-horror censor-machine that is FlaGuitars.I have always been very out spoken in the forums and have called out FlaGuitars directly when he has spoken down to people, called them children (in a round-about sort of way), and even broken rules set out in the steam forums ToS by dishing out, what I found to be, offensive, derogitory and insulting replies to people who have called him on the deluded way he handles forums posts that do not adhere to his selfish, bullying attitude.The most recent case of this, some one, (rightly so) asked why his forum posts keep getting deleted after a few hours. Being a victim of this unprofessional practice FlaGuitars preaches in the post, I posted a reply detailing my experience with exactly the same issue as the OP. I named FlaGuitars (as he is the only moderator on the forums), and gave an accurate, detailed desciption of what happened to my previous posts n the subject. Less than an hour later I was banned from the forums permanently for 'Foul language and insulting a moderator.' Which is kind of ironic, as all I actually did was speak about FlaGuitars censorship in the forums. To think that FlaGuitars find his own acts 'insulting' is a joke in itself, considering the amount of people I have spoke to he has directly insulted and offended by talking to them as if they were children, (which is also against the steam ToS).So in a nutshell, if you are happy with being treated like a 2-year old with no intellect and can happily follow a dictatorship-based community, and play a game with a never ending list of bugs, then by all means download and have a go. I'm afraid that if FlaGuitars carrys on his ban-wave of destruction, then this community is going to be dead before the game even comes out of EA.Note : I am also of the firm belief that the devs are unaware of the enourmity of the problems this one guy is causing to their game they have worked hard on, and I dont think they are getting fair bug reports due to FlaGuitars removing them in such a manner.If a dev ever reads this, you really need to hire another fourm moderator with better people skills that can take critisim. Mark my words, he will destroy your community.Thanks for reading my review.~XPS : Details of my ban can be found here :http://s26.postimg.org/nn83un4gp/ban.pngEdit 1: I did not receive a warning, which is in the community rules set out by the development team (your superiors, yes there are people above you), I need to have received before a ban of any level is dished out. Way to break the rules once again, I am the proof.""The bans may last one day minimum. From now on we shall always make warnings before banning.""http://steamcommunity.com/app/380600/discussions/0/527274088388296207/Edit 2:Thanks to reviewer Rezeak for finding this :https://partner.steamgames.com/documentation/moderating_best_practices#Banning""Bans should only be issued when someone posts in violation of the Steam Community Rules And Guidelines. Bans should be temporary in order to serve as a reminder of the discussion rules. Permanent bans should not be issued in most cases.""Edit 3:More proof FlaGuitars deletes posts he makes that are personal attacks.http://s26.postimg.org/6v3y9jtqx/rev3.pngOh, the irony...Edit 4:Links with proof/experience of others :http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rezeak/recommended/380600http://steamcommunity.com/id/CactuszGaming/recommended/380600/http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198054395134/recommended/380600https://s26.postimg.org/dfkz4hsux/mod_fourm1.pnghttp://i.imgur.com/9fLx8Nu.png

								Broke my reel after a 10 minute fight with a fish.  Not a Marlin mind you, just a pike or walleye.  He couldn't break my line, but he broke my reel after taking all 425 feet of line.  In 40 years of actual fishing I have never broken a reel.  Get you♥♥♥♥♥♥together if you are going to make a fishing game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The new update is designed to destroy equipment you grined together (or bought) so you spend more cash on new gear.Radically shifted to buy-to-win. Follow the changes but dont fish with anything you like to keep right now. It was ok with most players to make the game more challengeing (as it was easy, 3 fish sizes and ""hit the spot catches"") but that is not what this last update is about as things stand. I bought a couple of the DLCs, and tried permium for a bit to avoid grind but not spending a dime more until we see if these changes are permanent.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game WAS the best game on here for the several months I played it  before the ""big update"".   Well, folks, the devs have completely RUINED it with all the new criteria that must be met to play it.  Forget the pure pleasure of throwing a line in the water & see what happens.  I had a reel drop from 95% to broken on ONE fish. It must have been a nice one, but I'll never know.   I have been fishing for 55 YEARS, and I have NEVER broken a reel in my entire life.  Only one of MANY changes that have resulted in a BAD experience with this game as it is now.  I've lost several thousand in-game bucks since the new & improved version came out.  Can't afford to travel anymore, lose too much $.  No more big fish; even with modest drag settings, the line (or reel or pole) breaks because you can't retrieve the fish.  Still limited access to the trophy & unique fish because of very poorly placed paths & clear areas.  Wear & tear on the equipment?   Totally unrealisitc.  Of course if they make it wear out quickly, you have to but it more often.... but really?   I'm still using the rod & reel set my GrandDad got me for my 13th birthday.  Come on, for cryin' out loud !!  You made really HORRIBLE decisions concerning the game play here.   Admit it and fix it !!!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								It was a fun game but after the 0.7.0 patch it's gone down the drain. It seems now to be focused in player's real wallets instead of getting people to have fun and enjoy the game.The interface overhaul went into the wrong direction. Line physics are completly broken.What you paid with gold currency ingame had, most of them, the stats changed for worst.Just avoid it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I don't review games. I don't really think anyone cares what i have to say about them. But i can't hold my tongue on this one anymore.I used to really enjoy this one, in fact it was my go to game, until they ""rebalanced"" the game a couple of months ago. I could log on, kill a few hours, have fun chatting with folks and catching fish. Since the rebalance, it is nothing more than a grind game. And a slow one at that.Heres what I used to  like: The game worked. rod and line physics were reasonable, i could catch enough fish to make a few in game credits and didnt have to micromanage.All of that is broken now. the fishing line is like rubber. the rods are like slinkys. The fish don't bite enough to keep things entertaining. Costs are so high that i can't see how a new player would get anywhere. Heck I'm having trouble making the new economy work at level 38. And the social aspect is ruined as well. They added stupid 3D avatars that basically fill up every fishing spot and ditract from the experience. I can't turn them off, so I fish alone to keep from having <insert name here>'s arms and rod in my line of sight.The devs have claimed that they fixed some of the issues by lowering travel costs at certain places and tweaking the physics. I don't see any improvement.The way i see it, its a game. It should be entertaining, and this just isn't anymore. If i want to catch only six or eight fish a day, I'll wait for spring and walk down to my dock and do it in a couple hours.I would have recommended this game 4 months ago, now I just can't. If you want to fish, go to a real lake.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Easily the best fishing game out there and not because there aren't many fishing games out there but because the game does a great job at immersion with beautiful visuals and audio and you can just relax. Of course by relaxing, I don't mean that the game is easy, if you want to go for small fish go ahead, that's easy, but if you want some nice largmouth bass you gotta work for it!DetailsThe game is full of small little awesome details. Like I only realized recently that there are actual fishes in the lake! I always thought that the game was random and it assigned a fish to your hook (based on location and bait etc...) when you caught one, but no that's not how it works! You can see them if the water is clear and shallow! They move around your bait, poke it, hit it and if you're convicing enough, they'll bite it!Learning curveFirst thing I'd like to mention is that, you don't need to have any actual fishing experiences in real life to be able to play and enjoy this game!The game can be hard at first, specially after you level up once or twice, all the new equipments that unlock can be overwhelming. There's a tutorial at the beginning of the game but it doesn't cover a lot of the stuff you'll need to catch bigger fish later in the game. So you'll have to look up tutorials and read item descriptions to figure out how to work with the new rod you just bought.Although there are some pop up tutorials here and there after you level up, catch a new fish or buy something new, I'm not sure exactly how they are triggered, but they give you some essentional info about for example how to catch a new type of fish.Fuzzy Logic, No RandomnessAlso there isn't an element of randomness to this game when it comes to catching fish, by that I mean that the game uses a fuzzy logic recognition system. What does that mean? It means that when you're trying to catch a fish by for example a retrieval method like Stop&Go (there are multiple retrieval methods in the game), your consistancy in luring the fish determines the quality of the fish. That's not randomness, that's as close as you can get to real life simulation! I love these devs!The DevelopersSpeaking of the devs, they are great and they know what they're doing. They are active and constantly fixing the game and notifying about the server's status etc...TL;DRIt's an awesome fishing game, with some suprising great little details. Try it, you won't regret it! No need for real life fishing experiences.8.5/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Well as a last resort I'm reviewing this game. I've been playing this game from within 30 days of launch. It has had it's ups and downs. About a year after release this game was pretty good. Great physics, decent amount of lures maps etc. Then the devs announced they were try to get the game picked up on a console. Suddenly the devs began to cram features and items in at an alarming pace, and began to refuse to fix known bugs and play issues. Suddenly the game physics got worse, and lag spikes abounded. Did anyone fix any of this? No but they did ad avatars, so that people you don't know can jump up and down in front of you while you're fishing... YAY!The current state of the game is unplayable, not to mention the times the economy has been ""tweaked"" where the only result is you have your hard earned money stolen. I don't recommend this game for anyone who wants to have fun fishing. If you like grinding games like cookie clicker then sure play it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Fishing Planet was a game with tons of Potential when it first released.The game has since initially grown in popularity and success, at first the dev'sdid some unique things, like tournaments where they actually ponied up and payed out real life cash for the winners.They released more content more places to fish, they brought out competitions etc.At first glance it seemed like a game heading in all the right directions.And then you started to see the true end goal.  To make money!  However, why should a gamemaking money be that big of a deal its sorta the purpose of a game is to make its developer's money!Well its how they have done it,  at every turn they make the economy more brutal.  They introduce wear and tear on your rods and reels, now they have even started to nerf DLC content, yes stuff people already spent money on is being rebalanced???  Why so they can sell a new replacement for it!!!  Your premium currency formerly Gold has been readjusted to baitcoins...  and they same things you could have purchased with you gold 10 times over you can now only afford once after the transition from gold to baitcoin.  Even the tournements are broken, 2 fishermen do not have equal odds to win, it depends on who has spent more money and has the better gear?!?  Fishing Planet is a game that had tons of potential that is now nothing more then a slow agonizing grind, you need to be an accountant with HR Block in order to navigate all the travel fee's and licensing fee's and then you have to have a plethera of time on your hands in order to catch enough fish to pay off all those fee's.....  There is no casual fishing as any fishing trip in the game demands a commitment of time just to break even.It possible things could change in the future, the game seems to change and update frequently, but most of the changes have been in the wrong dirrection.  And for that reason I cannot recommend this game and suggest you check out IceLakes instead....  while its only Ice Fishing its a fair more enjoyable experience!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I love fishing, I live in FL and fish all the time.  I've been dying for a fishing game that's worth anything since sega dreamcast was around.   I want this title to do well, this game has all the right ideas, all the things I would want in a fishing game.   Since it is early access I won't harp on game mechanics and physics as I know they will improve.  My biggest problem with the game is its just not fun.  Let me explain, in Fl in real life I go to a lake I can catch many species using the same bait by adjusting I how I present it to the fish, where I'm from bass,bluegill,catfish,etc,etc will eat a nightcrawler.  It may not be optimal but it happens.  In this game its not like that at all, I find myself searching guides after frustration sets in.  You then find to catch this species you cast in this exact spot, during this time period, with exact leader setting at this amount, using this exact lure or bait and then grind for hours using that exact setup.  There isn't really any rng.  Once you get the xp needed to reach next lake you then go to guides find exact spot and grind for hours on the next fish.  To me thats not fun.If you don't like grinding you can spend 150$+ of real money to get the better lures, and xp boosts.   I probably don't play this game mostly because of the costly dlc that comes out that you need to buy if you don't want to play for 12 hours a day to compete with others.   The very first day this game came to steam I spent 20$ for a weekly boost of some sort and it does not go by game time it goes by real time so it forces you to play alot to make it feel its worth it purchase.   I would rather this game be 40$ and come with all content then claim to be free to play.   Its free to play to get you in the door then when you feel the grind you pay out the A##.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Okay.This game is the most fun I've had in any fishing game so far. Seems like there is a fair bit of expansion to be had, and I'm thrilled everytime I have a bobber drop.Don't get me wrong. This is a bit of a waiting game, but fishing is about either finding fish or lucking up to hit that 10% of the water that fish reside in.Did I mention there are fish in this game, and you can CATCH them!?Great attention to detail as well. The black crappie I just caught looks like one I just caught last weekend.Edit as of 9/16/15This game is so relaxing I've started using it as a sleepaid at night. Its almost as peaceful as camping in real life, I just wish there was a volume mixer that was more than just music, and effects.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								""That's boring."" You're right, it isn't exciting, but you're missing the point. It's meant to be a relaxing diversion, and that it certainly is.The tutorials have recently been updated and have greatly improved the ability for new fishers to learn to play, too. I still recommend checking out some player-made guides and tutorials, but they're no longer vital.The thing that sets this fishing game apart in particular is how tactile the controls feel. The 'grind' isn't bad unless you want earlier unlimited access to new fishing regions, and the premium equipment doesn't appear to offer a real ""advantage"" over the common type. There isn't a competition or race. It's all fishing, and that's all I could ask for!While there could be many updates to be made in the future, it's pure shoreline fishing for the time being.Still Fish outta 10 Written at the time the game self-declared as Early Access, didn't leave Missouri ingame yet.

								Turned from a great, fair fishing simulator to a pay to play cashgrab.... R.I.PIf you are on the 2nd highest level, have enough gold and cash, they simply add 10 levels ( where 1 lvlup needs more xp than 20lvls did together), raise ingamemoney-prices about 5-6times and convert your gold into ""coins"" (1000gold = 100coins) while the gold/coin-price stays the same.... thanks, but NO THANKS!

..:: HONEST REVIEW - NO BS AND A** KISSING ::..NOTE: Since this game is in EA this review will change with time (or not if developer keeps breaking his own game).MyScore: 4+ Gameplay: 6+/10Graphic: 5/10Audio: 6/10Developer: 3/10Pros:- currently best fishing simulator on the market***- many fishing locations, fishes, baits, gear, etc.- sometimes can be fun,*** - best in genre doesn't mean good in general...CONS:- Since update 0.3.0 game is just unrealistic to the point where stuff breaks when it shouldn't or doesn't work like it should. Update brings a lot of nonsense to almost all parts of the game ultimately gimping gear, fishing mechanic and fish AI. - Update 0.3.7 doesn't fix anything (durability system is still broken/gimped, values for gear strength are messed up and so on...) and brings even more issues with bucket full of boring content. There is nothing more anticlimactic than small pond (which they call a lake haha) filled with pretty much same small fishes which are on starting location in this game.- Developer bans people for bringing up negatives about the game on the forum. They keep ignoring any negative opinions even when opinion is supported by loads of valid arguments and facts. Basically if you have negative opinion and you want to share it on the forum TO HELP THEM UNDESTAND WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE GAME YOU ARE VIEWED AS HATER. It doesn't matter how many facts and valid arguments is behind you .. you still are treated as hater whos ""supposedly"" attacking developer and they will remove you from forum. It's pretty much gaming version of ""Amy's Baking Company"" from Kitchen Nightmares.- Their Early Access statement is just one big pile of bs:""...our team is aiming to deliver the most realistic and fun sportfishing experience...""""...Our main priority is to ensure uncompromised realism of the fishing experience...""Update 0.3.0 is putting this statement to the grave.""we intend to use Early Access to polish everything out by fixing any bugs and introducing new features with the help of your feedback""They not only not polishing things they IGNORE feedback and push low quality/broken content while adding new DLC for 30-45 euro. Greed at it's finest....""...should take us approximately four months, with a full release planned for November 2015.""They claimed to have game polished in around 4 months... it's been 10 MONTHS and they not only didn't polished anything they also are nowhere near releasing this game. Game in current state is all over the place with bugs, gimped mechanics and psychics. Just mess... - Moderator deleting video evidence of game breaking bugs on the forum. Gives false excuses saying that my line broke becasue it was at 0% when in video clearly is on 94% and keeps talking about me not using ""pro"" meters which would show that my line is at low % which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t becasue its irrelevant what meter i use. The point is that small fish broke heavy line and it shouldn't happen so they want to hide it by deleting any evidence. Game is broken and it's reflected in 0.8kg fish breaking 3.6kg (and even 4.5kg) braided line like it's made of paper.Evidence:

			Fishing Planet - Update 0.3.7 In a Nutshell		

- Most of positive reviews is bogus and there are even threads on the forum calling people up to deal with negative comments. I guess they want to do everything to boost dying game.- Developer which doesn't understand how bad his development strategy is:FP lost most of initial player base and after 0.3.0 even more ppl just left.- Developer making fishing game doesn't understand how fishing gear and physics works.- Another developer abusing Early Access,- Only one server:Game server is located in NA so Europe and rest of the world is screwed by over 130ms ping causing game to lag,- Bad development decisions:They working on VR when almost no one can use it or can't afford it while delaying development of more important key components.- Quantity over Quality:They keep adding stuff without polishing audiovisial components and mechanics to setup solid base. They keep changing and messing up what was working fine.- Some sounds can get annoying to the point where you turn of sound or there are sound which shouldn't be there,- Recommended System Requirements are a joke:My specs are above it and on max settings i get avr. 25fps while facing water.- Outdated glitchy and average graphic: On low setting it looks like something from 2005. On full setting foliage still looks bad... only water and lilypads looks good but game cause PC to sweat like it's some freaking Witcher 3 or Crysis,Our ""avatar"" in the game is like some weird human shaped alien which glides above ground... Srly???!!! They could deal with it in a creative way... oh wait they aren't creative.- Graphic lag/Freezes/Client - Server lag: Basically everything from switching windows in UI, switching rods or people posting on chat cause performance issues sometimes to the point when you get 3-4 second freezes or you can't cast lure properly,- Complete lack of optimization:Game is so many moths in development not to mention 8 in early access and they still didn't optimize game,- Boredom caused by how easy to catch are biggest fishes:It ain't unique/trophy fish if you can catch 10+ of them in one IRL afternoon. Basically game spoils player with trophy and unique fishes being childishly easy to catch.- Grind:There is nothing funny in catching over 300 fishes all pretty much same size just to be able to move on to next level,- Boring  grind events:Basically grind based event where you spend few IRL days to get useless rewards,Lack of creativity is they key problem.- Irrational decision making:Basically they make decision which doesn't make sense e.g.  crankbait have damage indicator but soft plastic lure doesn't... rod is damaged while it's not even under load... and so on...- Rubbish, ridiculous and overpriced  DLC's with existing Pay to Win factor: Right now if you buy DLC you get mostly gear which is for free in the game + 3 rubbish skins for ONLY!! 45 euro... what a nonsense.Again lack of creativity is the key problem.FP developers: Good DLC is affordable by everyone even those who gain steam money by playing other games so 1.99 euro is perfect price which everyone can afford and support your game. On another hand balanced DLC have content which doesn't add pay to win factor and still brings something fun to the game, e.g. custom made crankbait's with regulated lip/weight or fishing rods with custom shaped handles and ""accessories"" on it + custom textures, etc. I do not recomend this game and play it only if you're desperate person. At first it can feel good and you can have a bit of fun but soon enough grind will kick in and all the bugs and glitches in the game combined with grind and boredom will simply make you angry to the point where you will uninstall. Only thing keeping this game alive is group of scrubs ready to spend 30 euro on DLC ;) My prediction: This game will end like Euro Fishing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I've recently started to play this game and it truly is a great game. That said, the latest patch that basically introduced pay to play is worse than a mobile phone paywall game. The leads on this game clearly have nothing in mind but cash and it's obvious, especially this early in development as they 'test' these paywalls. I'll update this if things change but : Great Game but will be basically locked behind a ton of your money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Total cash grab. Could have been a great game, fishing with friends online would have been awesome. You can't go two seconds without some sort of popup telling you to buy premium. Not only that but the fishing, although it has some accuracy, is for the most part arcade style and brainless. Put on the right bait and cast, and you catch the fish. Simple as that.

								Was fishing somewhere, did not play for a few days, now I don't have any more credits and therefore can't play the game any longer. Forum says: contact support and ask them to reset your credits counter. Sadly I can't find a way to contact the support. Even their website only says ""Play the game"", yea, nice joke, but no chance to contact them.Until that crap isn't handled, I have to say: nope, can't recommend that.So if anyone can tell me what to do, that would be nice./EditSo people told me the developers are ""pretty responsive"" on Facebook. Ok, I just deleted my Facebook account because of reasons. I don't want to go back. I have this game on Steam, the developers need to have a contact support system, like a mail address, or contact on the Steam forums, which they don't. Nowhere in the game or here you can even find out who developed this game. Other people tell me that I am stupid and should log in every day for the bonus credits you get this way. Good idea, I only need somewhat above 2000 credits, so by this method I would need... months of logging in into a game I can not play, just because the developers don't have a support system so I can't tell them about this bug a lot of people have, according the forum threads.So please stop calling me stupid or giving this review a thumbs down or calling me troll. I do liked this game, it was pretty relaxing, but I can not play it anymore because of some very stupid bugs, which are bugs and not game related things that I did wrong. It's a bug when you don't play a game for weeks and the game tells you after coming back ""Well sorry, you now need 2000 credits to play this game, but if you tell anyone on Steam they will say you are a troll, and by the way you can't contact us. Maybe on Facebook, where you just deleted your self. Yea, life sucks""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								TLDR: Fishing planet is a very beautiful and relaxing game. You can play for free so ignore the stupid ""pay to play"" reviews  as its difficult but possible, just be warned, the devs are a group of greedy mot-er fu-kers, and its evident once you are inside the game. Try it for your self, just dont fall victim to their obvious ploys, spend wisely friends!A once  beautiful game, now rulled by the mighty $. Every thing that works the best, gear bait etc, all costs bait coins. You can get baitcoins for free, 1 a week (yes you heard me right, ONE a week), 10 for placing first in a catfish competition, and thats it. They removed getting baitcoins for unique fish, so forget that idea. You can play this game for free, it is free to play. But you will be fighting week to week just to be able to stay afloat monetarilly. They decrease how much money you make perfish, and increase the ammount you pay for every thing, and not in a small ammount, well over 100% increase from beta. You can not longer purchase Unlimited licenses for cash, only bait coins. They say they are going to increase ""fish productivity"" after nerfing that into the ground, but lets be realistic, the company showed their colors, and personally, I am sad I even bothered supporting these greedy fools in the first place (Yes I bought a few of the DLCs in order to show support for a game I once had hope for. Yes I will still play, but I will be damned if they ever see another cent from me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I used to love this game, paid for DLC and all that .. this new patch has killed it. the random rooms are empty , kinda ironic as you don't ge to enjoy the new 3d models lol.. but a more important thing to Note: If you buying DLC from them, they will and have in this last patch removed DLC content such as the iron maiden keeper from holloween dlc. I loved that item  lol.. but who cares how I feel about it.. I paid Real Cash for it and others they have removed from the game. I did not get ""baitcoin"" or what ever it's called for the items I paid real cash for after the patch, I did not get the 100 extra coins as a gift.  I've sat down and worked out the math to double check this. based on their patch notes and the exchange rate they gave.. i'm owed several hundred more ""premium"" cash for the stuff they took from me.  this should be illegal. the people in charge of this games are low, dirty thieving jerks.. I know they have to pay for the game dev some how.. but stealling from your Dieing player base of loyal fans via removing their Paid Content is a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor excuse. Do not Trust this game or the people behind it.  side note, as a fishing game option, it is one of the better fish games out there.. but it's not worth the loss of real cash you might want to pay if you did like it.. and pay wall? holly crap.. i've never seen any casual fisherman ever pay several grand to drive to a lake to fish.. what the hell were you thinking.. even with todays gas prices lol.. wow..

								Fishing planet, Well where do i begin,some may say missouri... me i say from my childhood playing games by the likes of ""big ol bass"" and ""championship bass""to name a few, this is the kind of game i had been looking for, for years!Having read the ""roadmap"" for this game it sounds like it may fast become one of my favourite games of all time, now thats quite an achievment considering my gaming history.anyway, on to the game itself,in its current state its pretty darn playable considering its still in early acesswhen playing it draws on real life knowledge, like what habbitat does a perticular fish like, what food does it like, is it line wary or will it just have at anything going past ect.For me this firmly plants it in the Realm of actual Simulator, instead of those simulator wannabe games.Fighting a Fish: you actually have to fight it instead of just reeling in, lest you break your equipment or risk loosing the fish.The Tackle : Tackle variety is Decent in its current stat with many Baits,Rods,Reels,Line,Lures and much more(to unlock items you have to be the correct rank or higher (you dont have to pay for a thing to unlock it all))The World : the fishing planet world is based off of three main things currently; Level,Cash,Gold. You gain xp/levels for catching fish, the better the fish the better the xp, the same is said for cash which you use to purchase things like new tackle,bait,Licences and moving home to a new state should you wish. Gold is a kind of Special currency only aquired by catching really nice fish called ""unique's"" (you can also purchase gold using real money should you wish) you can use said gold to purchase special items, These Include : special baits, premium rods and reel's and better wearable equipment.MY experience in Fishing planet- having bought a couple of the DLC packs i thought ide have a look to see if anythings on sale considering its black friday, and i noticed there was so i decided to buy a 360 day premium pack, shortly after buying i noticed the pack hadnt apeared in my ingame inventory like normal when i purchased the DLC so i thought ide leave it a while since the servers had just come back up after some maintence, but still nothing, i thought it must have had somthing to do with the maintence that had just happend. so i decided to email surport and query what had happend. The staff responded Quickly, They are also really pleasant and profesional and after a few emails back and forth solved my problem. You can really tell These developers do Care about there players and about making there game better.I was pleasantly surprised by this considering the tarnish that some early acess games/Dev teams leave on players.Overall this is a really enjoyable game and i cant reccomend it enough to anyone who likes Fishing or even if you've never been fishing in real life but want to give it a try.Totaly worth the time and money ive spent on this game.

""The Best Damn Fishing Simulator Ever""	  Honestly I can't think of any fishing game I have ever played that was better.   First of all the game is absolutely beautiful, the environments are very natural and serene. The water dynamics like ripples and splashes in the water are amazing. Also there are many locations and over 34 types of fish with more of both to be added in the future.  The fishing is very realistic, sometimes you can almost subconsciously feel your mouse tremble as you see a nibble and set the hook. The fight of the fish is very satisfing especially with big ones, where battles can last over five minutes.  Fishing Planet is a very relaxing type of game that you can lose hours playing. It's one of those games that you don't have to be constantly at the keyboard. You can sit back and relax while playing or get up and walk around to strech your legs, go get a snack, yet your still in the game.  The game works on a level based system where you earn XP points by catching fish. As you increase yor XP, your level rises. Higher levels allow you access to better rods, reels, baits, lures and tackle in general. Higher levels also allow you access to the other locations where the fish get a lot bigger thus the need for better gear. The best kind of free to play model, you don't have to pay for anything. You can purchase three things with real money; in-game cash, a premium account which gives you increased xp for catching fish and DLC packs. None of these are required to play the game however. You have complete access to everything in the game for free, with the exeption of having to grind a little to earn the higher tier locations and equipment.  This game is in early-access which means it is basically an alpha. Which also means it is not completely finished and has aspects of gameplay not yet added like boats, free roaming and multi-player. These features will be added in the near future but the lack of them still does not undermine the playability of the game. Even without these features the game is still wonderful to play. It also has bugs and game mechanics that will be rebalanced as well. This is the nature of all early-access games. I played a few early-access games and this one is in much better shape than your average early-access game, try it for yourself.  In closing, Fishing Planet is completely free to play, is a small download about 2gigs and runs well on even lousy computers. Highly addictive and also very satisfying as well, what do you have to lose? Fishing Planet is an absolutely a must own game if you are any fan of fishing.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The game is in ALPHA and yes there are tons of things wrong as far as bugs go but is is playable..After 60+ hrs in game I have to say it is a  SIM that has the normal grind for gear like all games do. With that said it is FREE TO PLAY (so why not play it?). IMO it's FTW=FREE TO WIN cause you can buy everything in the game with ingame cash that you get by playing!!!NO PAY TO WIN!! yeah sure you can get a prem account but that only gives a xp advantage.As for graphics is really polished and looks great! Sound gets abit dull and boring at times but its ok.

								Best fishing simulator/game I ever played.You can play for free no problem, it just takes you a bit longer to reach your goals.Whenever I'm in the mood for fishing, but weather is too bad, season is just wrong, or health prevents me from doing it IRL, I can just get on here. Add a great community to that, and I got all I need.Is it good? I think so. 343 hours logged and about to add more.Are you a person that needs something to happen every second in your life? Then this is probably not something for you.  This is a simulator, not a fish-reeling game.But if you want to relax, join us with a rod and reel by the shores, and perhaps come on teamspeak as well for a good chat, and if needed, some help.

								It was fun for a while, but it bacame obvious after a few hours that they have tuned thru a recent update to make progress very slow. Low level fish pay a currency based on size. Catching bigger fish pays more currency, but are gated by tackle. This tackle is gated by level. You must pay currency to travel to fishing locations, and for example 220$ to go to the first unlocked lake. It took several hours of irl gametime just to nearly recoup the travel cost. So be prepared for alot of time invested if you want to advance without paying real money. The task is repetitive, based alot on chance, and even your victories aren't really rewarding. All in all i think its tuned to far towards long grind. You'll grow bored before you get to the fun parts. Good luck.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I am a level 10 newbie, that being said, I want to go to faraway places and catch unique fish and not drain my wallet to get 5 fish. I used to fish in Missouri for about 225 credits and I could come out the other end with at least an extra $70 from catching catfish. Now they decided to downgrade the price to $1800 (did I say downgrade, I meant jack up by %800). Now, in order to gain any money from Missouri, you would hve to catch about 100 pounds of young channel catfish if you wanted to come out the other end with any hope of gaining money. What a shame because this game showed some promise, and, I bet, if they had not inserted these P2P and P2W schemes, people would have bought more DLC's because they saw that this game was a well-crafted, fair fishing simulator that was made for the purpose a game should be made, for fun. Now, If they wanted the option to allow players to donate with special bonuses (premium accounts), then I could understand, and there is no shame in making a video game for people and gaining money from it, but when you pull a theHunter on me, you can't seriously believe anyone will enjoy your game. If I wanted to throw away my money, I would have just gone to a strip club. At least then I would get some fun in the end. Game devs, if I could go back 6 months, I'd like to see how many times you slammed your head into a brick wall to come up with this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. the updates were for ""balance."" If I was on a tightrope I was your definition of ""balanced,"" I'd be♥♥♥♥♥up on the floor right now. All in all, I would have rated this gme a five out of five if they reverse all of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t they put in it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I'm hooked.All puns aside, I downloaded this thinking I'd delete it very quickly. However I started playing and that changed drastically. Not only is this in-depth (although I don't know much about fishing), but it's easily accessible and personally I find it very fun to play. It isn't an action packed game, but get the right techniques and you get rewarded for it. Reeling in big fish is an exciting struggle and you do actually feel good when you land it. It does have microtransactions, but if you play the game well, you aren't forced to use them, it encourages smart playing and research, which I find to be quite interesting. It won't be everyone's cup of tea, but it's free; so download it and give it a try, you may be pleasantly surprised! I know I'm excited to play this tomorrow.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								So I played this game for probably more hours in a couple of months than a couple of games I have owned for a year or two and I can tell you that alot of this time was fun. Until you get to the grind. If you are looking for a fishing simulator I would honestly wait for maybe a year and see where this game is in that time. Fishing isnt about catching and I dont believe the devs and many people actually realise this, its about the thrill of catching the fish, the fight and the thought that you have the chance to not catch anything or catch a fish that you can put in your personal records or the local newspaper. I am level 17 in this game right now and have caught hundreds of fish, If I was on a trawler boat sure I would accept that number but once you are grinding from what I have gathered 313 fish to get 25000 xp for level 18 to get to a new lake and actually catch some decent fish is rediculous, the process of getting this 25000 xp is pretty grueling requiring you to constantly fish the same old bass in the same old spot at the same old time with the same old lure with no real skill involved (promised dynamic fishing system not implemented). So the only way to get this XP is through ""Farming"" call it what you want this is not fishing its catching, when it gets to the point you are catching a fish every cast every day on the same lure it is catching, after a while this is no longer fun. When discussing this I have had the typical ""well go fish somewhere else"" ""stop calling it farming and you will eventually stop thinking it is a grind"". I am sorry but since I spent nearly a month in each of these spots ""farming"" it is boring and also ineficient as the lower level places give you less XP as you expect. Sure its a fishing game but not a simulation game like advertised which is sad to me. I thought the game would be fun and exciting after the new fish fights, It didnt. The only I see to really fix this game is to remove this XP system completely let people fish again, let them have fun, not every game needs to be about one upping people of stats, let people fish a spot and try to catch the biggest fish to drive a competition, lower the frequency of catches and the game becomes a fishing SIM the way it should be. Keep the money system and add more premium currencey tackle for revenue but please for the love of god dont turn this in to what everyone is comparing to a fishing MMO where it is no longer fishing. Even a license system like the hunter would do me but everyone knows that that would never work because funding a f2p game is a bad thing as as soon as money becomes involved it is p2p (Sarcasm)...

								Loved this game when I first started playing - great graphics, great physics, great ""Feel"" to it - you really do feel like youj're out there on the shore casting and reeling in, and when you get a strike you feel the battle with the fish. But...Then in the course of a day or two something changed. Where before I was pulling in a decent number of good-sized bass with my spinning rod and jigs, suddenly I go hours without a single bite. I went an entire 2 days of a rather expensive fishing trip not getting a nibble, on a lake that had always been super productive the day before, and yes I was fishing with the right bait, rod, reel, hook, and at the right time of day. I went from 3 dozen trophy bass in a few days to no fish at ALL.  Needless to say, it was obvious they had made a change to the game that decreased the number of strikes bigtime. To make the game more ""Realistic?"" Maybe. After all, who can really go to a lake and catch 20 23 lb bass in 4 hours? But you know what I have to say to that? If I want super-realism, I can get in my car and drive to my local lake and stand around for half the day casting and reeling and not catch a single fish. The reason I want a fishing GAME is so I can escape to a fantasy world where I can catch a lot of fish, unlike in real life where I basically suck at it! And no I'm not saying the game should be some easy joke where anyone can just grab a pole and catch a ton of trophy fish, no skills required. But for those of us who took the time to learn the right equipment to use, the right baits that work with the right kinds of fish, the right times of day, and the right techniques to use to catch each fish (stop and go, slow and straight, lift and drop, etc.) - we should be rewarded with good catches! And yes, plenty of them!Not sure if this is a temporary setback, or not, but time will tell. I can say that if the game mechanics have now been changed to the point where I have to sit around for hours at my monitor not catching a damn thing - just like in real life - then I probably won't play Fishing Planet any longer. Plenty of other games I can escape into for a few hours to get away from reality that provide the rewards I'm looking for in a game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								****Update**** Ok really can't tell people to play this game when they make a game where you have to get licenses and obey the law and then when they come to Florida in real life they can't do the same including breaking federal law buy catching and keeping a  protected species. But the worse is the spin control of erasing my posts and others calling them out on it. No bans just poof posts gone. They should own up to it, apologize and move on. They did the fishing ,they posted the pics of them and fish. They need to own up to it. 


Announcement: Fishing Planet iCast Odyssey (teaser included) 
Fishing Planet, Aug 5, 2016

			Hello fellow anglers! As promised it is time for us to tell the story of our journey to the iCast 2016 show and how we explored the fishing America.		


I would not recondmend this game. The game has some redeeming qualities but since I am not endorsing this game I won't mention those few items.1) Yes it is free to play, at certain levels though it is pay to win because if you want in a tourny you have to be lvl 17+ in order to have access to tackle that will catch the target fish or a fish keeper big enough that will let you be competitive, So until your high enough level to get those items it is pay to win IF your interested in tourny's.2) Fish mechanics are horrible. Everything from how a fish strikes to the mechanics of the catch are pretty bad. When the game started there was a huge cheat inbedded in the mechanic that allowed for almost instant catches, ever since then they have been trying to ""fix"" it but it has never really gotten there, they should have scrapped the whole thing and started over.3) Super grindy (understandable to a point) but the game squeezes you into certain lakes ao it basically spend all your time for a big group of levels at one lake then when old enough move on to another....The worse thing is they DO NOT tell you any info but you not being old enough for a lake equipment wise. I lost over 6 hrs of play (making money) only to pay the extra to ""move"" to a new lake and find out that I couldn't catch anything worth while because I was not old enough to buy the ""magical"" bait that only the fish in this lake will strike lol..4) Going back to the mechanics...the fish are all caught in ""spots""  Yep, spots, no wandering fish no moving targets and although fish in RL are often caught in ""spots"" only when those spots are active ( ie that special cove you are lucky at alot is because the wind blows often into the cove, increasing the food chain and the fish will move into the cove following the increased food chain, when wind doesn't blow into cove, no fish in cove) So it would have been far more realistic to have either multiple spots that change because of weather except there is no real changing of the weather( you have 2 weathers rain and no rain) OR just have fish wander all over and not have any stupid spots since they couldn't realistically simulate the other aspects of fishing like weather and water conditions.5) Now to squeeze out more money they have an equipment damage, destroy and repair system. Which is horribly stupid. I have been fishing with the same 3 reels and 3 rods for 25+ years ( I am in my 40's) I understand they need to get paid this is thier job BUT... Picture this... you pay 250 in game currency to do a few days of fishing somewhere. You forgot to repair your pole or lets say you want to goto new york and fish pike which will eat your pole alive. It is possible to end up destroying your pole before your trip is done, wasting all kinds of money. Now yea it would be the stupid players fault for not paying attention but moments like that should never happen in a game....NEVER...and no it did not happen to me but was the first thing I thought of when I played with the damage system for the first time.6) The game is full of ""non-explanatory"" moments. No in game pop ups or stuff to help keep a player from making mistakes like going to a fishing hole too early in level or joining a tourny that your too young to have the ""tools"" to compete. You WILL eventually waste money on something and have a ""wtf, nice of you to tell me"" moment. How uch time/money wasted will be different but sooner or later you WILL make a mistake somewhere, even if it is buying a lure that won't fit a pole...(yes only certain lures on certain poles)7) Which then brings me tooo...certain poles/reels ect.... This is a major say whaaaaat moment. For starters you can only bobber fish from a ""special"" pole which makes me giggle becuase NO ONE uses these poles in RL. They are alot like the old style bamboo poles as kids we would use in that they are really really long. But these things have reels. Basically the whole idea that I cannot take 2 poles (one 6 1/2 foot spinning set up and one 7 1/2 foot casting set up and fish with that everything and use every type of lure/bobber ect is just re-tarded. Other than special things like here in Oregon fishing pike or salmon you need steel leaders, salmon you need a very stout pole (think deep sea size pole). But other than a few specialty fish you can fish for over 30 ""game"" fish in this country using the same two poles I mentioned above.I still play every once in awhile to scratch an itch but casting in the same spot 150 times in a two hour period is just not fun. Not using my brain to figure out where the fish might be, is not that much fun. So when I do play its usually about 15-30 mintes because after that I want to hang myself with some spider wire.What they could have done to make it better:Real fish movements based on weather,time,moon phase.Real fish actions after hooking.( not enough variety)Total openess in fishing tackle I can buy and what set-ups I can use.NO DAMAGE SYSTEMNO magical fish spots.Find another way to make money other than breakage ect. Tourny's for ALL players broken down by level brackets with fish that CAN be caught by lures ANY player can buy not just DLC items like tourny's are now unless your old enough.Sorry but I really hate the whole pay to play feeling hiding behind a mask of well ""if you level long enough you can play in those tourny's for free without the DLC"".....You shouldn't let a player join if they can't fish it and be competitive against others.....

								Ok so this is my first Steam game review. This game is so good I am spending part of my Fishing Planet time to write this. I love everything about this game except one thing, which i will get to. First the pros:  1. The amount of details the developers put into this game is unreal. Every fish species has its habitat you have to fish for it in just as in real life and the habitats are true to life. Even the action of the lure you are using is a big factor just like real life. Same with the bait. Just like fishing in real life combine all those factors and execute your cast and retreival properly and you may have a chance at the fish your hoping for. Odd are though, that it will be just another Bluegill.2. For an early access game, in my experience this has the least amount of bugs, personally I haven't experienced any.That being said I have heard in game that others have been experiencing visual glitches. As for game mechanics, i have heard nothing. 3. The graphics are quite decent and doesn't bog my graphics card down much, if at all, and im running max settings on an old NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460. The water looks good, pretty realisic. The only thing i would say is add a little more such as the occasional fish jump and more to the fishing gear section such as sunglasses. So if your wearing polarized shades you can see past the glare and be able to see the fish underwater. I know that would be a lot to add but it would just improve the overal appeal of the game and add to the realism of the fishing in this game.The only con is the license system. Now i know this game revolves around realism but come on, the only thing worse than buying a license to fish in real life is buying one in a game. Every. Time. You. Go. On. A. Fishing. Trip. Unless you wanna spend an absurd amount of in game money for several months worth of fishing. Here's the thing, I live in Upstate New York, The We'll Charge You For Everything Except Taking A Shi%, Oh Wait We Charge For That Too State. and i only have to buy one once a year. And only for a measly 20 bucks at WalMart. I am just glad they don't make you pay real life money for in game licenses, or else i wouldn't play. But catching fish doesnt earn that much money especially when fishing trips in game are ridiculously expensive coupled with expensive fishing licenses. But if i wanted to not be able to afford to go on a fishing trip i would just shut off my computer and sit at my desk and not go on a fishing trip. Lower the prices of travel and licenses, but if you want to keep the prices so expensive have the fish earn more money seeing as that is your only source of income.Other than that i love this game and i would recommend it to anyone and everyone. I know some random guy's rating doesnt matter much but ill give it a 9/10, and if the income and/or prices change for the better ill change it to 10/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Well, I played this game for almost 100 hours then it got very boring and i had to farm to level up. Then the new update with the new AI, fight mechanics and of course the new strenght meter came. It got waaay worse than it was before and i stopped playing. I came back to see what happened and yet every single fish escaped for low line tension (even if it wasn't low) and i had to fight a 1 kg trout for like 15-20 minutes. It was the best fishing game and the devs ruined it with the new updates and I'm sad because i really liked this game. :(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A perfect game for relaxingLast time i played a fishing game it was on a PlayStation console. Since then i couldn't find any fishing game which would be interesting and fun. Fishing planet combines simulation with arcade and the result is pretty good. The game is realistic enough to keep you playing, try different baits and lures, time of day etc. and it's arcady enough to be fun for casual players.Gameplay is pretty basic, you choose the lake or river, pay the money for transportation, buy the licence and go fishing. The are countless baits and lures, rods and reels. You choose the correct ones, cast the rod and wait. If your equipment is low level it can break very fast, but if you use it correctly it wears pretty slow. You can buy equipment to store more things (you can take limited amount of things to the lake with you).What i don't like is the licence system. I'll try to explain. There is in-game time, you arrive at the lake in early morning and time slowly ticks while you're fishing. You also must buy a licence with in-game money, but licence are valid only for the time you purchase it(1 day, 3 days etc. You can buy unlimited licence but it cost crazy amount of money) so if you purchase a licence for 1 day it is valid for 1 day in real time while game clock stops when you quit the game. I think this is not fair. People after work don't have much time to play, they purchase the licence and play maybe for an hour in the evening and the next day the licence expires. I think licence should be tied to in-game clock and licence time should freeze same as in-game clock when you quit. If developers want money they should make and sell new lakes as DLC instead of items or boosters.This game is free with in-game purchases for real money, so i guess this is the reason. Developers want people to buy licenses for real money. Anyway you still can fully enjoy the game without spending real money. Leveling is very slow but it wouldn't be fun to level up fast in my opinion. If you're short on money you get some each time you launch a game and there's free lake where you can farm money and exp.The graphics are acceptable, it could use some work. There are maybe 10 or so maps which are very small so it shouldn't be too difficult for developers to make them look better, after all you stare at the same environment for hours so it would be nice if it looked better. game runs steady 60fps all the time. Water on the other hand looks amazing and realistic. Well you kinda expect that from such game anyway.Developers made a good work on the sound department. Sounds really add immersion and make you feel closer to the nature.All in all the game is really fun, a perfect game if you want to relax and listen to the sounds of nature. Try it, it's free :)Pros:Great performanceYou will not get bored after 5 hoursGreat variety of fishConsIn-game purchasesLicence system			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Was addicted to this game, racked up 209 hours of game play in a little under 2 months. They increased the cost of everything, unfairly converted your gold (200 gold = 20 baitcoin now, wtf? ) increased the cost of licenses by 10x, just plain ruined the game.Fish and lure behavior completely ridiculous now, gotta pay to ff time... On and on. Do something better with your time then spending it on this ripoff.UPDATE:Had to add this. From the early access section on the store page.Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?“The game will stay Free to Play but the starter-packs and in-game purchases WILL COST LESS IN EARLY ACCESS, in comparison to the final full-version retail prices.”How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?“We will have an intense and fruitful Forum interaction between the development team and the Community as well as weekly Twitch Q&A sessions that help us gather ideas, feedback, and any possible bug issues.We perceive the Fishing Planets Early Access community as one big family that is helping us shape the game’s evolution and prioritize the development process by giving their votes in support of certain features and ideas.

								This game showed a lot of promise when I first tried it out.  I opted to set it aside and wait for it to be completed.  That was quite a while ago and it hasn't made much progress since.  Now it looks as if it is going to be pay to win with microtransactions and I absolutely will not support a movement that is ruining gaming for consumers.  Make a good game worth paying for and I will gladly pay what it is worth.  But if I'm going to spend my money on fishing gear, it's not going to be virtual.   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								One of the best fishing simulators I have played in a long time. Many modern aspects of fishing such as the licenses, locations, and all the stuff you can buy in the shop are amazing. The variety of both fish and shop items makes this game actually fun to play. It requires a little patience but not so much that your waiting 10 minutes for your bobber to move. Developers definitely listen to the community and have added so much such as competitions and new items in the shop.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								5/23/2016Still hold out hope they can get things back on track but with each update it seems less and less likely. Before update 0.3.0 back in March this was without a doubt my favorite game and I played it any time I had a bit of free time to do so. After the update though the new fishing mechanics were/still are so unrealistic it’s more frustrating than it is fun. You’ll literally fight a fish for hours in game and hope that after all that work that this 5lb fish doesn’t completely spool your 30lb line in the end like it’s a shark or whale. I’d hoped they would fix this and kind of bring down to the level at which it was before the patch but so far we’ve still got these fish that are obviously on steroids. Never in my life have I broke a rod or reel. While they have slightly fixed this issue they still break way too easy in the game, I think we may be using glass rods and reels. They also made all gear wear out so now you need to repair everything pretty much constantly, which eats a good chunk of the profit you earn.  The only logic I see here is they wanted people to have to purchase more in game currency as before you could play the game 100% free (buying a membership grants you 50% increased experience so I always had a membership for the boost and to help support the game) with no issues. You still can but the less experienced/new players really seem to struggle now.Two good things that came in the patch were the gear matching (however the way it’s setup means that having max rod slots is all but mandatory to avoid constant gear swapping) and they fixed the right mouse button spam that plagued the game. To be completely honest I wish they would have just fixed the right mouse button spamming and left the reset of the fishing mechanics alone as they were fine. In the end it’s probably still the best fishing game out there however the player base has really dropped off in a short amount of time. I’ll keep hoping they bring the game back to its former glory but as for now I’ve all but completely stopped and I wont recommend the game in it's current state as the fun factor just isn't there anymore like it was before the big update.**Updated 1/4/2017**Stopped back to see if any progress had been made to fix the game and came across the Beta notes. Seems the Devs have decided to make some changes to things that may have helped the game. Instead of removing the level caps to lakes they've increased the level cap while also limiting what you can get XP for (no longer for achievements). They are getting rid of Gold finally AND replacing it with BaitCoins, which appears to be the same thing only harder to get without spending real money, imagine that!! Permanent licenses will be gated behind BaitCoins, ggwp Devs. Forwarding time will also be gated behind BaitCoins... Basically everything that was good about this game has now been changed or is behind a paywall. Good lord this game used to be so good, it makes me sick to see what the cash hungry morons have done to it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								If you want to be able to post any comments about the game that might be negative based upon over 700 hours of playtime.. I would not recommend it... I was banned from the forums for making comments that are not nearly as negative as others in this game.  The reason given was that .. ""my opinions do matter"".. even though i claim they do not.. WEll if they do matter... then i would not be banned.. But I am.  Of course, as one player said... we should be happy to be able to speak at all.. bc in some places people are punished for this.. especially Women.... well i can understand now.  It is very sad that as a player that has purchased almost every possible DLC, in further support of development of the game.. of a development team that has grown by money paid by people such as me, from 5 to 20 members, would ban a player for making comments negative.  I have played more than 700 hours in this game... and i can't comment about anything.  The game could be great, if they actually allowed people who have played to make comments, if they actually decided also to update the community in steam about progress... where the game is based.  However, they don't update you in steam either.. none of this development team believes it is important to update the community in the forums of steam.  Instead you have to go to a radio show on twitch if you want to find out any information one that lasts hours.. or, also, if you would like to participate in the beta of this early access game.  This is very sad given that it is dedicated players like myself who would like to see this game succeed... They should think about how they treat customers.  They allow moderators... not even in development, to close threads of discussions as they see fit, and to ban permanently members who have been loyal customers.  It is hard to say i do not recommend this game but my feelings about these issues seems every day more to cloud my opinion...I still love to fish.. and it can be a very nice fishing simulator.. too bad the team making this game does not think more of their customers.

								Hate to write this because it was my favorite game ever, but I played this game everyday for about 3 months, I even bought 2 dlcs. I quit playing for a couple of months, came back and they have just made it too hard to play without it draining your money, they have jacked up the prices to travel, prices for liscence, bait, tackle, and now even charge for things that they didn't before. I didn't mind spending money on dlcs and a premium account before, but forget it now. Its a shame because this was an excellent game, I hope they figure out that they messed up and correct this, but sadly I doubt they will. It all boils down to GREED.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The best fishing sim I've played. Not perfect, but absolutely better than the competition.Pros:Immensely diverse range of tackle, gear and baits. This is kind of a double edged sword as the depth of options makes for a steep learning curve; selecting the right gear for the right species is problematic, especially for starting  players. One needs only to take note of the subject matter within the in game chat channel--this almost invariably consists of players asking 'which hook/leader length/area do I need to catch X fish'. That said, I don't think the brevity of tackle options should be considered a negative. This balanced a little bit by the number of guides and info videos available online--most of what you need to learn can be gathered pretty handily outside of the game.There is a wide vvariety of fish to taget and while most do share similar rig preferences, there's still enough nuance required in order to land trophy and unique specimens which makes for good challenges.Calender events serve as a way for players to catch fantasy fish which are worth fair amounts of in-game currency, which can be used to purchase the best gear and baits. Nothing is locked behind a paywall, although special offers do come along seasonally which gives people the option to purchase extremely high end gear at lower levels--in this sense, the game is technically pay to win. Fighting fish is a fun, and unlike Euro Fishing, the physics which govern these are intuitive and intelligible;  striking, reeling and lure retrieval mechanics are all well concieved  and work consistently, and solidly. The graphics are pretty good for an in dev game, ambient noise is realistic, and the locales are pretty enough to look at.Cons:Perhaps ironically, Fishing Planet is possibly too realistic. Missed strikes, incorrect rig, lure and bait choices can result in lots of time spent winding or watching a float bob for no result. It pays to do your  research before heading out. It is also quite grindy; levelling is slow especially in the teens, and this is exacerbated by the fact that gear access is level restricted. In order to catch fish which yield worthwhile cash and experience  relative to your level, you often find yourself needing gear you can't access. The result is that you wind up grinding out fish which are no challenge to catch, and yield little rewards and experience.It's a bit off kilter and hopefully the devs correct this in the future as this is probably the biggest, and most monotonous flaw in the game.As far as I can tell, unique and trophy fish seem to drop at inconsistent rates depending on the species. Trophy catfish in the starting area are common, yet you can expect to reel in dozens of bass before landing a trophy specimen. Post patch, alligator gar have become impossibly rare, whereas unique redear sunfish are caught hand over fist. It's a broekn system which requires an overhaul.Overall, and  considering that Fishing Planet is pre-release, it's definitely well worth playing. The foundations for something great are all there, It just needs some refinement. And there's enough to keep you interested in the interim.Score: 6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								While improvements has been made to fix the broken massive-update, which broke the physics and made extreme slow-downs, I still can't recommend it. It is not relaxing and exciting to actually fight on to catch enough fish to pay for the licenses and fees and continuously fixing the degrading euipment. It's not fun, especially that they now further nerfed the biting ratio of the fish and it seems like the peak times are short  and the fish stops biting abruptly, right after peak time is over. People need to rely on youtube videos to go to a new place and immediately start fishing exactly as the youtube video instructs them, because they are afraid that they gonna run out of money if they don't cacth the necessary amount of fish to keep them playing. This isn't fun, but a crazy grind and every single fishing lake is reduced to a 4m^2 spot, where everyone fishes at a given hour to catch a few trophies and uniques. Nobody cares about the rest of the lakes and rivers, nobody cares about the bush and trees. Your game is basically a few tiny spots to fish for the fish now , that gives the most xp and money, nobody cares about the rest of the fish and nobody really cares about what other lures baits out there, beside the most effective ones.  90% of the lures and fishing gear is irrelevant. 90% of the fishing spots are irrelevant and uneccessary90% of a game-fishing day is irrrelevant and unnecessary.90% of the fish are irrelevant. After a while everyone figures this out and the game is reduced to about 5 fish worth to catch with about 5 different lures and baits and that's it. Befor you judge others or me, I have paid over $30.00 in DLCs, that's pretty much the full price of a finished game, and this game is still early release. Fishing is suppposed to be fun, not a struggle.  Unless the developers aiming to make a survival game and the players have to depend on their wallets to survive.  It's a quick way to become unpopular, if you ask me. This review gets updated,, whenever any updates applied and changes the gameplay to either direction.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I reeled in catfish with that night after night, and after cleaning it up ready to go again, so how is this update realistic?

								So this game used to be very enjoyable.  You could casually fish, relax, pass time, and move from place to place with a little work.  The F2P model was good, and I even payed some money to support and buy some gear/tackle or lisences.  But the latest changes destroyed the game for the casual player, and really felt like an all out cash grab.  Advanced licenses require real money, travel costs from lake to lake dramatically increased.  Now playing feels like an all out grind from the get go instead of an enjoyable progression.  It really did have the potential to be a great fishing game/simulator, but at current build is a game fueled by greed on the developers part imho.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Advertises Multiplayer and Co-Op capabilities. These are not currently part of the game, therefore negative review. I understand that this game is in Early Access, and because of this it can't be judged in the same way as a fully released title, but if it was at least mentioned in the store description that multiplayer had yet to be implemented I wouldn't mind. But the fact is that multiplayer is advertised in several locations on the store page, even though there is literally no sign of it being even close to available within the game itself.

								I was somewhat skeptical about this game at first due to the free-to-play model, since F2P games have catfished me one too many times and most modern fishing games are pretty crappie. As it turns out, Fishing Planet is a kick bass simulator that has hands-down the most in-depth modeling of fishing as a whole. Licenses, catch/keep systems, leader lengths, tackle box storage, real and artificial baits...it's all here. Everything from fish activity cycles to river drift is modeled in a way that's accurate, but still fun enough that you won't want the developer's head on a pike for making something that's as slow as the real thing is sometimes. The early game can be annoying since panfish are near-worthless for leveling up and will often make it difficult to get at the more valuable channel cats, which is a load of carp, but once you get over that hump, your options quickly open up for gear and species, and fights can become really cutthroat. I played a lot of fishing games back on the NES/SNES, and even for someone as pickerel about their fishing games as I am, I'm enjoying Fishing Planet a lot. ...salmon.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Up until the newest patch this was a good and relaxing game to play, to gain vitual money and xp was a little long as both are needed to go to better areas and get better equipment but this was acceptable as you could hone your skills and tecniques. Now the new patch is here and they have increased the fish IQ which now makes the fish unrealisticly intelligent. Now they can remove the bait off your hook without causing a disturbance to your float, when you do manage to hook one they race off to the weed beds and wrap your line around the weeds which snares your equipment, leaving you to try and rescue your equipment while the fish saunters off giving you the preverbial 2's up. Let's be real Devs....fish are thick, don't give them something they never had in the first placeNow your equipment deteriorates at an alarming rate...how can throwing nylon line into fresh water once knock 1% off it's durability, salt water possibly...maybe. I assume the reason why they have now changed players equipment to be made of tissue paper is so that people will spend more of their hard earned in game cash, which now is even harder to get as you can't catch fish to sell.Well done Devs you have done what all other failed computer game creators have done, listened to a very minor group of annorak players and broke the cardinal rule, DONT TRY AND FIX WHAT IS NOT BROKEN !!Due to this recent patch you have lost alot of players, maybe you will see the errors of your ways and change things back making this enjoyable and playable again,if not then I wish you well in the pits of obscuredom which is now where this is heading.

								This used to be a half way decent game, but after the update it has turned into a complete money grab. You can see this when you leave the area where you were fishing and it tells you that if you had premium, you could get a lot more in game currency for the fish you caught then you would if you dont have premium. Another place where this crap is shown is how the game makes you pay even more in game currency to be able to keep (and in turn exchange for credits) fish that make the fishing worth while.

Before u could just chill daily for 1-2 hours and fish on your favorite spots nowdays people are asking around for specific fish to make up for all travel / lures expenses (not to mention baitcoins and gear that it exclusive to that currency - after update u can't get any of those from unique fishes as it was back in times) . Sad to put such negative opinion on one of my favorite games in the past but i guess most games nowdays are just bussines for people - this bussines just went to far for players to enjoy...

								This game is amazing!!!Def the best fishing game I've ever played actual fishing part wise. Why the negative score?They changed it so you can no longer have a home state. This means you have to pay for travel EVERYWHERE now. The first one past the begining lake is $1800. It takes me about an hour to get that $ when I am f2p. Then the best is that if I make a mistake and have to go back, that $ is not refunded at all. Lower travel costs or bring back a home state option and I'll change the review, for now I guess I'm just stuck of the Lone Star Lake.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Great Simulator, Nice Progression, But The Grind Is Real+ Does a great job of simulating and the best fishing game around+ All 3 different types of lines (Mono, Fluoro, Braid) all have their strengths and weaknesses but overall the lines are balanced+ Nice Progression System+ Grind is Not that Bad (until you get to level 16+)however the bad parts to the game a few issues with bugs such as the teabagging in Florida or the game giving me frame drops a second before i get a bite to help tell me ""hey i'm getting a guaranteed fish on the next second"", and finally the fish flying around in circles at times when you go to reel it in.the grinding is pretty acceptable that you don't need to get premium so long as you have the skills and the patience to grind.. However when you get to level 16, the grind is so unbearable that the developers have basically forced you to want to get premium beyond level 16 as the xp scaling is so much. At this point the fish give between 45-60 xp per fish and the next level requires 15k xp and you only make about 3k xp per game day. At this point it takes you 3-5 real world days just to go from level 16 to 17. and from level 17-18 (requires 25k xp) it will take you 5-7 real world days aswell, making the grinding so painful at this point without premium. it took me 3 painful days just to go from level 16 to 17 and when i got to level 17 the xp gain did not even improve so i am either forced to get premium at this point or endure the pain of grinding. at this point i have decided not to continue playing the game as i would have completed it without premium but the grinding is just unbearable now that i can't sit there and grind so hard to gain one level per week.so take your time with the game because when you get to level 16 be ready to shell out for premium.

								Fishing planet is the ultimate relax experience. Moreover, despite being F2P is not by any means P2W and not repulsive in graphic/simple stupid gameplay terms.In fact, graphic is nice and close to imitate realistic pond and everything you can find around it- logs, plants, boats etc. Audio is calm and minimalistic. Besides intro music (which is great) there are only sound effects which is actually a great decision as it fulfills the calm and silent atmosphere of fishing contemplation. Birds, water and mosquitos are the perfect background to sit back and chill out.As for gamplay it is really more complex than throw and tow. You get yourself into two main ways of fishing- spinning and angling. Spinning is where you go for the fighters and predators. You must master several techniques of spinning as different predators respond differently to given bait and its movement.When you get tired of fighting you can take out your angler and do some peaceful casting for some less fierce fish. There you have to know what given fish likes to eat the most, where they hide and at which depths. There is a lot to learn and fishing blind and random will result in small blue basses. When you do your research and come prepared, you will get comparable results with big largemouth basses and heavy catfish as there is very little randomness in this game. If you know what you are doing you will get results making it very high commitment-high reward game. It will never make you feel you lost your time, even when you pour many hours into it.I covered barely some of the aspects of the first fishing place, there are more really challenging lakes as well as more types of fish to catch. Although being still in early access, game provides countless hours of fun and relax and there is lots of competitive stuff planned for the future.Moreover its free, so you can try it out with no money loss. Although when you try it, you will feel that the devs deserved some monetary gratitude for their tremendous work that is far superior to good ol' Trophy Bass series in every aspect.

								As far as a fishing game goes, the ""game"" outweighs the ""fishing"" portion by a large margin. It seems to be all about slowly building up your gear with incremental upgrades at prices and stats that are set with only competetive balance in mind. The gameplay itself is very simplistic and doesn't feel very natural. There is no walking around a lake or getting in a boat- you pick one of two or three spots on the map and you'll be teleported to that particular ten square feet of shoreline where you can clumsily sprint to the water's edge and begin ""fishing.""  It's never difficult to tell what the developers are focusing on in a game, particularly when the game is in Beta. In Fishing Planet, you can loot through the tutorials to quickly see that there *are no tutorials about how to fish* but instead only tutorials about how to navigate the menus and buy new equipment. Equipment, mind you, that is most easily obtained through DLC. You didn't misread that- the game which isn't even out of Beta yet is already charging for extra content. Yeah, that's what the world has come to. You'll spend more money on this game that you would just buying a rod and reel and going to your local pay lake.  So what about the fishing game mechanics? Well, there are a couple different cast types, but I had to figure out how to do them through the in-game chat because there are no key mappings to look up, nor are there tutorials for the game itself. There is no way to adjust the strength of your cast and there is no player skill involved in casting. The bobber appears to be giant and really messes with your depth perception because it seems to always be the same size regardless of it being in your hand or out in the water (which I believe was intentional so you could see it better in the water). But doing that is a moot point, because there is a torrent of meta information always flowing to you that the game insists you should have, such as a large display showing your bobber and the water level on it, as well as information about reeling in your lure too early. The process doesn't feel very developed, and the mechanics themselves are extremely lacking. Any chance they'll work on making the game flow better or flesh out the base gameplay mechanics? Not likely, they seem to be solely focused on adding new fish to the game and new items for the in-game market, like fireworks that you can set off.  So yes, it's a game. Is it fishing? That's debatable. I don't have a problem with develpers looking for a profit, and that's not where my complaint is. My beef with the game is that the CORE GAMEPLAY has taken a backseat to the in-game market system, and that sets the tone for the whole development process. What you see now in gameplay is likely what you'll see as a finished product, and there are hundreds of fishing games out there that offer better fishing mechanics. Pro Bass Fisher for Windows 95 was a great one, and honestly beats this game in every aspect but graphics.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I am really liking this game so far and I'm really glad I found it. Probably the one of the best fishing sims I've played. You can do most things you can in real life like adjusting drag, jerking your rod to get free from snagging some weeds, choosing where and what time to fish, etc. I'm not gonna lie, it'll take you awhile to level up and you'll probably be catching a lot of bluegills when you first start because certain fish needs a certain bait and time of day to get. Not to mention where you cast on the body of water and how high or low you set your bobber/leader can also make a difference. Took me some time to get to level 3 so I can get the casting spoons for bass but when I got them, it was worth it. There's also an in-game chatbox where other players can chat with one another. I found this useful. The majority of the community is just great in this game. I did however, run into a few people arguing on chat about irrelevant topics and a player who told everyone that they suck and he is the best fisherman on the server but most of the people are willingly able to help each other out if a player needs help or tips on how to do things. The game kinda tends to be a bit laggy at some times but not a lot. Anyways, with that being said, this game is still a great and relaxing simulator. It's free, why not try it out? :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Other than the small crash issues at the loadinga and quiting, I really wanted to enjoy this game. To summarize my short opinion of it so far:Pro's:- Brilliant Scenery!- Starts off slow, you'll need to have the patience to get to the Intense fishing before you really start to enjoy it, so hang in there!- Relaxing Music and feel to the gameCon's:- Limited movement space, the player has very limited space to move, which is surprising with the amount of places down the river. To move to a new spot, your basically having to do a 2 or 3 second load to that spot. Overall, there was not much point in adding Character movement. I was hoping for a bit more freedom in movement and allowing the player to explore the scenery beyond.- Crashing at the fist Loading Screen, Note: Don't Click or press anything whilst on the loading screen, If you get the Please wait pop-up. Then click please wait and it should eventually load.- Crashing on Quit..The crashes will obviously get fixed eventually though. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								A wonderful fishing game thats a little rough around the edges.This is an early access review of Fishing Planet. As of this writing, the game is currently on version 0.3.8 with an average update cyle of one every other week. I also have 400 hours in this title since August of 2015. I am a liesurely angler and have only recently reached level 21 in game.Fishing Planet is what I would consider a pseudo-simulator. The primary goal of the game is to relax and fish, though tournament style fishing is planned. As anyone who has fished in real life would know, you're never guaranteed a catch. This is the main point where Fishing Planet leaves the ""true"" simulation. It must balance gameplay with realism, and as such, catch rates are generally higher than what you would find in real life. On the other hand, you are offered a wider variety of rods, reels, lines, tackle, bait and misc. equipment designed to target a range of fish in a range of situations. You then couple all those decisions with your retrieval style, such as straight retrieves, stop and go, lift and drop, among others.That being said, what is planned and what we have currently are two different things. If you come into Fishing Planet at this time, expecting a perfect simulator, you will be disappointed. Fish currently have spawn boxes and set times when they spawn. Venture your lure outside this box or through this box at the wrong time of day and you won't find anything. Fish randomization is something the devs are working towards but, for the time being, the same general strategy is required. There are guides and spreadsheets detailing where to cast, when and with what lure/bait that will, hopefully, be rendered completely obsolete in the near future.There is a leveling system in place to limit where you can fish and what fish you can realistically catch. You can't just hop into the game and expect to catch 20kg Muskie immediately. You'll first need to catch smaller fish worth experience and credits to level up and purchase new gear, as well as licenses to higher tier lakes. The devs have recently ended a test in regards to removed level locks on lakes, and as such, it may be removed on all lakes in the future. If that's the case, your only limiting factor will be gear. You will still have to earn your gear by leveling up or bypassing level locks by purchasing DLC packs focusing on certain gear types such as heavy float rods or ultralight tackle. These DLC are completely optional if you wish to take your time and fish.Waterways are currently limited to North America, specifically, the United States. However, there are plans for European and Asian waterways in the future. Fish species are diverse and dependant on where you are. Current species include, but are not limited to Gar (Alligator, Florida and Longnose), Bass (Largemouth, Smallmouth, White, Peacock and Striped), Catfish (Channel, Blue, Flathead), Panfish (Bluegill, Crappie, etc.), Pike, Trout, Salmon and more.Graphically, the game is beautiful. Water physics are a sight to see. Ambient noise is great though some lakes can be a tad bit annoying to listen to.There are some rough spots though. They range from physics (fishing launching into the air) to fish AI bugs (fish don't even bother fighting on ocassion) to equipment bugs (drag exerting tension on the line even when not under any load). None of them are major or game breaking, in my opinion. Your mileage may vary. I currently would recommend this title to anyone who enjoys fishing as a leisure sport. Perhap, once tournaments are added, more competitive anglers will have something of interest. Arcade anglers, however, I fear would not find this fu. There are no easy-mode toggles such as underwater cam, reel assist, automatic tensioners or the like. If you don't know how to fish from real life experience and are unwilling to learn the basics of how fishing gear works, you may find this a difficult title to pick up.Just remember that this IS Early Acess, which means things are always changing. As such, don't get too comfortable with how things are. If something is easy to exploit, expect it to be changed, if there's a bug, expect it to be fixed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								A fun game, ruined by the latest update. Physics are terrible, controller buttons can no longer be modified, and the prices of everything have skyrockted to the point you'll have to pay for everything. I can understand in a Free to play game you need to make revenue, but this is crazy. I'd have gladly paid a moderate price to just buy the game, but the devs want $60+ per year to play, and that's not gonna happen. There's a lot of other great games out there I can easily spend my time with and never miss Fishing Planet. Goodbye....			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Imagine your standing in the middle of a town with a fishing rod... theres a barrel 80 yards in front of you with fish in it.If you cast at it and land your lure in the barrel, you get a fish! if you cast and miss the barrel, no fish!Allright now change the backdrop into a forest sceen next to a lake and disguise the barrel with camouflage. BAM you have just recreated fishing planet mechanics.Now cast into that barrel for 2000+ times, and you will have created fishing planet progression!Whats the reward for progressing? You will get a new lake backdrop to put over your barrel facade!*slaps knee*			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS GAME!The recent changes implemented have made this game a bigger money grab than Facebook games.A few weeks ago my review would have been positive, but i can't in good conscience recommend anyone to waste their time on this fiasco.IF the devs see the light and chose to re-instate our PAID content in the form it was at purchase, get rid of the silly in-game cooldown that begs for money every time it pops up, and allow players to purchase ALL licenses and gear by playing rather than spending hundreds of dollars to have an even remotely enjoyable experience, i'll gladly change this review.

								This game was awesome! WAS! I played for 8 months learning and then they screwed the ENTIRE game up with a stupid update. Worthless. Uninstalling. Bad career move, devs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								858 hours waiting to see  if this EA would finally take off and mirror the the boast of its creators. Sadly whilst graphically its 10/10 that is all it has going for it. As for realistic . Not even close. Now don't go on a hate rant I am evaluating the game on its description by the creators. Simulation od real life fishing. Come on guys who are you kidding it isn't even close. You cannot use the mosty used cliche ""it's early access"". Hooks that even Jaws would have trouble swallowing and floats normally used for mooring boats too. A game where every single facet is hinged upon the drag max on a reel!. How ridiculous.This game is doomed and it seems all the devs are interested in is putting more and more content in to a broken game. The rod reel physics have never worked from day one even if they have come a long way since the winch and haul method. Then comes  the cheaters  that were forewarned long before they arrived as in  all games some must win at any cost and pat themselves on the back for comfirming they are the lowest form of life breathing on the planet. How on earth do you expect to simulate a lake when there are no fish living in it. Spawn spots are not natural and are just pockets on a lake where 90% is devoid of any life. I played a 2D coded fishing game for 16 years and as a simulator it was spot on in every area and is still to this day the best fishing simulation ever produced.  It is a shame that despite describing themselves as fishing enthusiasts( reading between the lines meaning never picked a rod up in their lives) they do not posses the knowledge to make this game a worthy title. 6/0 hooks 30lb line with bloodworm as bait and being pulled all around the lake by a 15lb fish does that sond like a simulation of any fishing scenario any angler has ever had. The game is disjointed and a mess tbh. They are putting too many thumbs in too many pies and diluting what they have created. For a non angler it might occupy your time for a while but for any real life angler it's safer to stay on terra firma than engage this nonsense 2/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								If you had asked me 8-9 months ago i would have said by all meens try this game.Unfortunatly the latest changes have made a verry good but challenging fishing sport free to play game to a if you dont want to spend mass amounts of cash on it into a DONT BOTHER game. I have to say to the developers for shame to there excesive GREEEEED. You could fish for months real life time from lvl 1-max lvl 40 and still not have enough fish credits  for the pice of good gear. I hate to bash the game but  we have all wittnessed the death of another reely fun free to play game into the rebirth of another pay through the noes in blood NOT WORTH THE TIME TO DOWNLOAD pay to play game. ABSOLUTLY BREAKS MY HEART.....			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								was really enjoying this game, was slightly confused by all the negative pay to play comments and was enjoying a decent fishing simulator right up until it hit me, fine after fine after fine putting me around $5000 in the red and making it almost impossible to progress without paying real cash or spending hours and hours grinding small fish at home lake. ive played pay to play games but this one pretty much took the biscuit for how it forces you down that route, id avoid at all costs and definitely dont recommend , hopefully someone comes out with a decent fishing sim not pay to play			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
