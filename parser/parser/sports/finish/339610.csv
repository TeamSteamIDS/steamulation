												let me give you a proper review of the game i played it since closed beta so most of the people praising it are players who played it before steam and spend TONS of money on it and they're trying to sugercoat the game so gain more players so they can curse at you and humiliate you also call you noob.PLEASE READ IT ITS A WARNING ABOUT THE GAME.pro:-great gameplay.-costumization.-different dunks.-teamwork required.-scoring feels satisfying.cons--HEAVILY p2w (like seriously check the cards your can obtain all cards wich are gold are only obtainable through cash those cards can be upgraded more than 10 times) and don't forget the +10 stats on clothing wich is also only available for cash (with item balls) only free players can only have +5 stats on a clothing piece i calulated the stats you could earn with cash and with ingame money free players can get to +35 on 1 stat paying players can get over +65.-HIGLY toxic playerbase don't get fooled by the rookie server the pro server is swarming with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s bragging that they spend the most money in the game.-usseless gm's they ban you if you say bad stuff about the game i already had a warning message from a gm.-relies highly on ping for the pf and C position.-players posting the most dumbest things on the forums wich has nothing to do with the game its almost as bad as facebook.-pf's are highly overpowered they can shoot 3's like a sg, shoot 2's like a sf,dunk like a pf and rebound like a C and pf's has a skill that makes C's completly usseless.-C's are HIGHLY underpowered DO NOT!!!!! take that position they got almost completly usseless cause of pf's. -mostly foreigners good luck finding english players.-idiotic players who keeps wanting an asia server even tough there is 2 asain versions  of the game already.-playerbase is next to none before it came to steam and there is a good reason for that.-prepare to get kicked out alot. -special characters that is only obtainable with cash gaining special atributes.-players who have vip cannot be kicked in fact vip players can kick the host.-most events require cash-cash clothing so big it litteraly blocks your view of your character.-special characters have a bigger hitbox-tons of exploits like when you playing as a C or PF most of the time you needs to split into 2 to win and either way you get the blame.reason the game is so p2w is because its following the taiwan version of the game the korean version is 10X better and not p2w at all. if it din't have all those cons the game could have been so much better this is the REAL review of the game from a player who played it for 6-5 monthsP.S. don't listen to uncle he got the worst excuses like you don't get the timing right like ♥♥♥♥ing seriously? i jumped the same time as the opponent did get your eyes checked.and don't listen that he never paid anything because he would call it ""DONATORS"" that match proved my point more than ever.

												First time I felt the need to write a review.  This game is truly satisfying if you're a competition junky. You don't even have to like sport games to enjoy this game.  The gameplay and game mechanics all work well, untill that point where you hit level 24. As a beginner, I started out playing against other noobs and various pro players that had their smurf accounts in the rookie/major league. I had some epic losses, epic victories, various intense close point games that went into second overtime. Eventually, I managed to get to level 25 with a 76% win percentage overall, I felt like a solid player that played his role ( PF ) well. In good matches, I'd block about every shot, bad matches I'd let a few slide.   All the fun in the game stopped though when I entered the  Pro League.Match after match, you get to play against level 50 characters that not only have the most ridiculous skills that you could think, they also have so much experience that not in another 1000 matches could you hope to destroy them. They also have, in almost EVERY case, dropped over 200-300 euros on cash shop roulette style items that grant bonus stats, cards and card upgrades that grant..bonus stats, extra skill slots, etc.  You name it.So in quick summary. You might love the game in the beginning, you might think you're a genius rookie player destroying the alt characters of pros. But once you actually get to the pro league, prepare to bend over and take it, over and over again untill you yourself are level 44-50 and have unlocked all the skills + slots. Surely by that time, you would also have dropped atleast 60 euros on the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bear with me as this is my first game review on Steam:Pros:- Great customization (Skills, Freestyle variability, Clothing, Stat allocation)- Requires teamwork (Heavy)- Crew matches (Like GvG in MMORPGs)- Easy to pick up, Hard to masterCons:- Community can be toxic (Will explain more later)- You can pay for stats- Fluid gameplay relies heavily on latency (ping)Freestyle2 is a great Multiplayer Online 3v3 Streetball game that pleases my thirst for basketball games.It is very easy to pick up (You only use direction keys + 4 basic keys + 2 or 3 more for specific skills),but hard to master.It relies moderately on basketball knowledge, such as actual basketball tactics like Pick and Roll, which can be executed in the right situation. To win, you will have to try your best to fulfill your one of five (C, PF, SF, SG, PG) position's purpose.Positions and their roles are generalized in FreeStyle2, although adventurous stat allocation may lead to fun and creative plays (like improving 3 pointers success rate on C or PFs). C: Rebounding and blocking, setting up plays under the paintPF: Similar to C, but takes an offensive roleSF: All-rounder (Dunk, rebound, middle jumper, 3s)SG: Also an all-rounder with heavier emphasis on 3sPG: Playmaker (Passing and loose ball grabbing)Playing the position that fits you and doing it right comes with a great rewarding feeling.Also, there are many team compositions which are strong, but you will run into hell lot of weird ones online (Triple Cs)If you aren't good at what your position is supposed to be doing by Major (past level 11), you will most likely be dealt with offensive words, telling you that you suck and that you should quit.The playerbase isn't large enough to have the greatest matchmaking system and tiers - and this is why sometimes you will face teams that will totally♥♥♥♥♥♥on your face. Knowing your position and having individual skills is very important in this game and when a single teammate is not pulling their own weight, it shows definitely. I highly suggest trying each of the 5 positions before moving onto Major (level 11+)You can pay for extra stats (btw you can also do this for free, but not as much). Does it help? Yeah, I guess.Does it win games? Maybe - it makes minimal difference.Why is that?Let's say a player purchased items and also obtained cards to improve his 3 pointers.If you are guarding him perfectly, he won't score any 3 pointers.If you don't and give him open shots on 3s, you should really blame yourself.Teamwork (Strategy, Individual talent, knowing how each other reacts in certain situations) is much much much much holy freaking so much more important and impactful than stats.Gamekiss will be adding controller support very soon, and I am so excited for that!Give this game a try. If you like working as a team and enjoy basketball in general, you will love it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bear in mind that this review comes from a person who used to play Freestyle 1 a lot of years ago. I've played in Thailand servers, in Gamekiss (NA) servers, in 4Game (Russian) servers and my country always had a big community in this game because we are big on basketball. There will be a lot of comparingBefore my rant, remember: I HATE BASKETBALL.Yes, I hate basketball. I've played this game for so long (the Freestyle 1 version) even though I hate basketball. You know why? Because this game is super fun even if you don't know anything about basketball. There is constant action, it's super rewarding to block, rebound and when you hit a 3-pointer, it's the best feeling ever.Freestyle 1 was actually rather bad.It was full P2W, clothes that give attributes were all costing money, the OP moves that were difficult to block were all expensive and you HAD to buy them with real life money. There were serveral exploits like when you receive a pass, you get a speedboost. Exploiting that, you could always step back faster than your opponent and make yourself unblockable. Level system was awful, you only got your real position at level 15 and the grind to 45 (max level) was like the whole game. High level people could do anything and everything so you had to block them every time because they would hit every shot. You know why that was awful? That's right, the speed boost exploit.Freestyle 2 possibly improves every mechanic that existsted in FSSB1. Skills costs like 3k at the start, meanwhile you get like 50k points at the start by registering, eliminating the grinding element of the game. Freestyles (Skills that only makes your shot/dunk different, making it harder to be blocked) can now be used only once or twice per game because you have to meet the requirements to do them. However, once you do them, it's garanteed points, so I think that's a nice touch. You choose freestyles on your own, instead of them spinning in the exact same order for the whole game. Music is constantly playing in game, making you feel in action. Also, the soundtrack makes you super pumped, while you can also configure it FSSB1 Games were all the same: PFs/Cs rebound, pass it to SGs and they shoot 3points OR PFs just dunking and you can't block them because they have paid for the awesome almost unblockable dunks. In FSSB2, or at least in early stages of FSSB2, it won't be like this. SGs can be blocked easily, there are way more rebound patterns for rebounders to learn, etc. Bigger skill variety Can be played with a controller. I haven't tried it yet, but I think it might be really fun Awesome rewarding system, making you feel progressing, most daily quests  aren't considered grinding and there are constant events. You also constantly get items and a lot of points, also making the game not P2W EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE BASKETBALL, YOU WILL ENJOY THIS GAME It's super rewarding. I watched a streamer play it with friends in front of 13k thousand viewers yesterday and he had a blast, meanwhile not even knowing that you can't shoot while you are getting defended by someone. He still had fun, I saw the excitement in his eyes meanwhile he was watching whether  the ball will go into the basket or not.  ALSO, IT'S SUPER FUN TO PLAY WITH FRIENDSEven if you dislike basketball, dislike sports games like I do, you might still have a blast. It might still be super fun for you, or at least fun for 3-10 hours. You have nothing to lose, it's  free to play. Grab some friends, put your game pants and gunnars and go play it! This game is awesome and the devs definitely stepped up their game, adding new elements and improving  the old ones. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I started playing this because its free and I actually enjoyed it. I had like 100+ hours on it creating new accounts to earn 150k points. Bought 500 Gkash for the event.I was able to feel satisfied with how my character looks and plays. But as soon as I reach level 24. No one would play with you. If there is, they will call you NOOB throughout the whole game. Then use a microphone and harass you throughout. Community sucks! People are jerks~! There are some who would play with you but for the most part everyone is a jerk. Downfall of this game is how jerks high level people or seasoned people are and it really sets me back.Goodluck to this game. Its fun till 24 and if you like getting called noob and doesnt bother getting owned by seasoned players or getting kicked from room to room spending 15 minutes just to play 1 game then get called a noob then kicked then this game is for you.

												+ Nice game mechanics..blocking,rebounding,shooting etc feels real and timing based..+ Graphic style is decently good..+ Various challenges and daily quests- Heavy money involved..like around 50% of the game content needs you to pay real money..i haven't been too deep into the game but seen the cool chars costs like $20 per character..- Level grind is quite slow- Servers still quite troublematic..sometimes you have auto win or auto lose because someone instantly DC'edupdate:- stopped playing the game since it's DCing all the time (im using the asian server)- played against a paid character and she had like 10 consecutive 3pt's (30 points)..its quite ridiculous even in real life basketball..

												The first negative aspect is the toxicity of the game. Theyre naive enough to insult and berate a teammate for a mistake when they also make mistakes. Through levels 1-23 I genuinely enjoyed the game. But when I hit 24 and was forced to go to the next server I was annihilated. The players were 2x my speed. My sprint was slower than their jog. The way the advancement in this game is setup favors veterans whom haave already achieved level 50 and give the new players near no hope. Was fun until level 24 so if you're looking to kill some time playing this game for a week or so is a good option			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been playing Freestyle for 7 long years. Since I was 12 years old, Freestyle has been my favorite game.It has been with me throughout all my teenage years, and I don't regret a thing.Ever since it first came out in 2006 (published by Activision), the game has had issues maintaining a good population due to lack of advertising and support from the foreign developers (JCE).That's all hopefully going to change now that it has been released on Steam. It's a shame how we had to wait so many years for this because this is one of the most competitive games in the world.Everybody who plays this game strives to ultimately be the best, and it's a team game so you have to find 2 other players who share the same mindset as you and want to be the best just as bad as you are.A lot of this game consists of managing egos of not only your rivals, but your teammates also.There is only one ball in the game of basketball, and scoring is only one part of it.You have to have a good overall team that can not only score, but rebound, defend, block, steal, and pass at the right times.This game is all about customization and making your player unique. There is a big item shop in the game that allows you to buy headgear,tops,bottoms, shoes, and accesories to make your baller look unique.There are also Freestyles that allow you to change basic animations like dunks and shots so you can turn your simple one handed dunk in to a crazy 360 between the legs dunk!Then you have your skills. Skills are new animations and upgrades you unlock through leveling your character.Skills are the most important part of the game since they give really useful animations like diving for the ball or fading away.When you first start the game and you go in to Rookies, you will be playing versus new players such as yourself who are also learning the game and it will be a cake walk for those who learn faster than others.Beware though, there is a huge learning curve when you reach the big leagues (PRO Channel).People do NOT like losing in Pros because it will result in their win % going down and the person that beat you having proof of them beating you.I was never a guy to make many friends on this game, in fact I made a lot more enemies than I did friends and I am very hated but my advice to you new players is, make some friends before you reach Pros.Try your hardest to communicate and socialize, post on the forums. MAKE FRIENDS. You do not want to be that ""random"" ""unknown"" person in Pros because nobody knows you and you will be kicked out of teams that have good players when you try to join because they simply don't know you.You will be stuck on the ""Noob Treadmill"". That means you will be stuck playing only with players who are really bad and don't care who they play with, and other unknown players like you are which means you will lose A LOT and people will never see you as good.So make friends before you get to pros! Get your name out there.If you pick up this game and decide you like it and you're either a PG,PF,or C then you can add my character in game, I will help you. My IGN is: ZarrySo yeah, that is it for my long review and although my time on this game is coming to an end, I am happy it is finally getting the exposure it deserves because I know theres a kid out there right now maybe even reading this whos 12 or 13 years old that will fall in love with this game and aspire to be the very best player just like I did.Good look in the pros, newbs.

												Having played this game for quite some time this is how I feel about it:Positive:+ It's fun: Seriously, the game is really fun.+ Has a nice mixture of simplicity and complexity: The game is easy to get into, the controllers are kind of basic but it has a high skill cap, it's hard to master them.+ Character Costumization: It's really nice.+ The game has tons of features to keep you entertained: Bingo, My Ball, Freestyles, Challenges, etc.+ It's rewarding to play: The achievement system combined with Bingo, My Ball, Freestyles, etc. makes you feel like a winner even when you're losing, so there's some reward in actually playing the game, even if you're not that good at it and just like playing it for the sake of having fun.+ MVP: MVP rewards the player that contributes more for the team instead of the one that just scores all the time. Maybe it could be a bit more balanced, but it's nice to see the game reward team play.Ofcourse there are negative points too.Negative:- Paying actually makes you better: Or atleast makes you seem like you are. Paid characters, like Ginger, for example, WILL punish you if you make a mistake, they are deadly because of the bonus they are given. Maybe in higher levels of gameplay that becomes less noticeable, but in lower levels it's really noticeable, they barely miss. And also there are skill slots unlockable by paying, and that gives more options to people that pay to unlock them, giving them an advantage over free plays. I'll put this on capslock: THE GAME IS NOT FULLY PAY TO WIN. That's not what I'm saying here! What I'm saying is the feeling that I got, that if you're a free player and paying against a paid character in a similar player skill level it's more likeable that he will easily punish your mistakes thanks to the character he has than you are likely to punish is, since you don't have as much stats and special bonus as he has.- Matchmaking is... weird: I dont know how matchmaking works on this game, but more than a few times I got to play against players that you could see by the skills they were using that they were atleast 10 levels above the players on my team. And I also felt the reverse on some games, that I was being matched with people levels below. Most of the time it felt fine, but I think it was like 80/20, so I thought it would be worth to mention.- Menus: Menus can be a bit confusing for newer players, since they are presented with a huge BOOM of stuff.- Clarity: The game isn't very clear on some stuff. For example, I had to go google for quite a bit of time why I couldn't level any stat after putting 5 points into it and the game doesn't tell you what keys to use on your controller, so even if it supports it, it's kind of better to play on the keyboard. That kind of stuff.Overall it's a good and fun game. I recommend it, even if you don't like basketball that much, give it a shot and try to bring your friends to play it with you, only makes it more fun. I'm curious to see the game evolve, since It's kind of new, from what I've read.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the same FreeStyle Street Basketball MMO under new management with a re-touched coat of paint and 5-10 extra ways to get you to spend money on items you don't actually want.Pros:-Fresh, vibrant artstyle-Arcade style gameplay-Decent Customization options-Well-organized lobbies ranked by skill level-Bot support-Clan supportCons:-Annoying community-Sketchy connection issues (On my first FSBB2 session, I was dropped from a game loading screen no less than 7 times in a row)-Puzzling sound direction (I don't necessarily mind the Korean rap, but the voice acting leaves a bit to be desired)-Too many unnecessary features. Booster cards, gachapon-style power-ups, robots that shout nice things and return balls for you after each shot in practice, a post-game breakdown that pats you on the back and lets you pick a mystery card: basically, every smoke-and-mirrors parlor trick mobile game designers have tried to implement into one gaudy, bedazzled cardboard box.In short: yes, I found it fun. I found it fun the last time I played the same game 5 years ago. There isn't enough improvement here for me to specifically recommend the game to any of my friends, especially not the ones who abandoned the game with me last time. I was expecting something different out of a sequel to a game that already had glaring flaws regarding netcode and connection issues, honestly. Daily Login bonuses and fake tickets for electronic roulette prizes won't cover up the few issues that still seem to exist.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Real basketball fans and players wouldn't be impressed with this game's mechanics or animations because this game doesn't  go for a realistic basketball simulation. Instead this game focuses on team play and player customisation and most of customisable things are aquired by playing the game, not by spending real money. Post game rewards and leveling up keeps you playing and grinding through the game. Just remember that if you want the best experience , team up with 2 of your buddies and it will be a lot more fun and enjoyable to play :) Overall: If your looking for a realistic basketball simulation - don't bother, It's not NBA 2K, but if your looking for a fun, grindy,arcady team game - try it out.

												Pros:- easy to get into with a bit of basketball knowledge- first hours are really fun- if you get good teamplayers and go on a winning streak, it is really fun but..Cons:- ..but that nearly never happens, toxic community, lot of ego players, who only spam ""pass me the ball"" and never pass back and insult you anyway- the game supports this ego style because being open isnt as important as individual skill and outplaying your direct opponent- simple but sometimes weird acting controls (buttons have 2-3 different functions, dunk and postgame for example), different results in same spots and blocks and rebounds seem a lot like coin flips most of time, or i didn't play long enough to understand the mechanics.- lags are a huge issue, a lot of players warp around the court and score or rebound or get lose balls without the game even showing anything. it just happens.- terrible UI, lots of bugs, long loading times, the game hides a lot of information for example skills and stats of other players, which i guess is intended because..- .. massive P2W, you can buy toys, cards, skills, freestyles and clothing with bonus stats- no real matchmaking, you could get a team of 3 Cs who just afk or a perfect P2W team with a 5 game winning streak, both games are going to be no fun at all.Summary:It really has a lot of potential and could be fun, but the issues and the community are just to bad to keep playing it for longer.

												This is from the perspective of a new player - i've played a couple hours or so of FSBB2 and here's my honest review. PROS: It's essentially 3-on-3 basketball. If you love basketball as a sport and as a game, this right here is it!  Simple at the start, gets more complex as you gain levels and ""skills"". This includes player skill as well as actual skills that you buy for your character ingame.  Additionally, customization is great. Loads of costumes, the ability to pick your skills to do stunts with, as well as ""freestyle"" skills, which you can think of as EX moves which use meter in fighting games;  do enough in a match and they become available for you to use. Cards are also a part of customization, you can load up cards that help you with certain statistics. On level up, you get to distribute points to certain characteristics as well, further making your character truly unique. Positions function as classes in this game. There're primarily offensive positions and defensive positions, as well as assist positions. All of them are viable, though some are more preferred than others. This gives some distinction between characters but as mentioned in the previous point, you can make your character have strengths that are adverse to contemporary assumptions. (A 3-pt shooting center? Why not?) Personal preference, but I like the aesthetic and music. It's fitting with the style of FSBB2.CONS:Oh dear, here we go. Perhaps the most destructive aspect of the game is the community. Predominantly filled with Filipino, Thai, and Indonesian players, English fails to become the primary language in this game. The community is very exclusive in nature, and unless you're part of their culture, you'll be isolated and alienated. Furthermore, many players are extremely toxic in nature, playing the game only to win. They'll personally admonish weaker players as soon as they make a mistake, and they take absurd pride in their own abilities even though they make mistakes as well. You wanna destroy a multiplayer game? This exclusive, toxic-filled community is how your game dies.  Pay-to-win. If you're a F2P player, be prepared to lose. A lot. Unless your team has veteran players or Pay2Win players, there's absolutely a slim margin chance of you ever beating your opponent, especially if they're Pay2Play. The greatest example I can give is that basic stats become skyrocketed the moment you have buffed equipment on. These equipment buffs are equivalent to around 30ish player levels at least, and that's not including the card and pet system as well. Between players of equal skill, the one with P2P equipment will always, ALWAYS win. That's just the nature of the beast. You'll be outrebounded, out blocked, out scored (your blocks will become ineffective).  Lack of a ""skill-less"" channel. You know, the above point can be completely circumvented by the addition of one simple thing - channels that remove all additional buff stats (but lets everyone keep a set number of skills). With this, everyone can play on an equal level. People will be forced to play with others outside their circle and the community will be more accepting. The only drawback with this server is that GameKiss will fail to make any form of profit from it. Who doesn't want to be overpowered? This is a stretch - but recent games like Overwatch have added special ""swear filters"" that replace the swear words with text to bemean the aggressor. A lack of such a system here (seriously, does anyone even use the report function) allows players to be as toxic and as horrible as they want without any repercussions. To be honest, I cannot see myself even reaching level 50 in this game with the current drawbacks. As I level more, the players become more unforgiving and loathing. It's embarassing to even be associated with them and their culture - I routinely kick toxic players from my team even though they may be performing well and giving me wins.I do love this game, and I can spend HOURS practicing my skillsets on my own - it's just that as a multiplayer game, the community is absolute garbage and leaves me wanting nothing more. Food for thought: why is it that SEA communities are always incredibly idiotic and taxing to play with? Most of them are asshats and ruin the multiplayer experience for everybody. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Too easy. Not Addictive.  Trash community. Trash gamekiss. Trash game 6/9 would not recommend.Edit: Ok, honest review : Unless you plan on dropping a few hundred bucks on a game that doesnt even have more than a hundred players on at once, or are extremely skilled/asian/no life at games, dont pick up this game. IT will suck away your already non-existant life and make you miserable. This game is not for the weak. The skill difference between top players and beginners is like a pro player in League vs a Bronze player. With the ASTOUNDING 50 active playerbase, you will eventually get put up against players that will destroy you sooner than you know(probably 1 week into the game).  Those that cannot survive a TOXIC COMMUNITY WHERE EVERYONE THINKS THEY ARE THE BEST and insanely unbalanced games due to THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS BY MOST PEOPLE SO THEY CAN BE OVERPOWERED should just leave. Backed with the fact that the company running this game wants to take your money, you will be pounded in AND out of game. Sure, the gameplay itself is fun and addictive. But still IT ISN'T WORTH IT. As a player who has achieved the PINNACLE OF FS2(becoming a major tournament champion), I would trade back these 2000 HOURS WASTED for a pack of condoms. Don't do this to yourself. Stay in school kids.2nd Edit : Forgot to mention 30% of the community hacks and gamekiss does nothing to ban/update the 2 year old hackshield. TL;DR -  FK YOU READ MY REVIEW IM A GOD.

												Been playing this game since release, and played way back since Freestyle 1 when Sierra own the game, still overall fun and enjoyable, don't really care much if it's pay to win, It's fun, the graphics doesn't really matter since it's cell shaded, and overall there are tons of skills to use. When it comes to BallingIsLife™ this game still deserves the award of being fun and even if you don't like sport games, this is still an enjoyable game due to the mechanics of it and animation which I find humorous. Game was my childhood and I'm still playing it.Pros: Easy to learnFun to playLots of clothes and customizationsLots of skillsToy system is interesting to play around for statsStill feels like the old free style gamesDunking on people feels amazing!TournamentsGrowing communityCons:Pay to win *Debatable*Lots of foreign people play so teamwork is hard to communicateServers are a little unbalance from level capsLots of people sliding due to the lag of the serverReasons why I say pay to win is debatable is because I have accounts that have never touched a single cent from my wallet, and overall I am still able to win games, on my main accounts I have 85% win rates on them and played over thousands of games with them, My personal opinion it really depends on your skill level and how you play the game, because when you're playing the game, you'll see that anyone can shoot and make baskets, or defend and block shots, its really how well you play with your team and how good your offense and defense is. Overall good game, I enjoy it and Its free, so play the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been playing since FSB 1 back in the Sierra days... and in my honest opinion... this game is fun but the community is one of the worst I have ever seen...The game is very fun and entertaining once you get the basics down but until then it's very frustrating playing in the rookie server with people who are selfish and doesn't know the meaning of teamwork... Some people don't realize that this game actually has a pretty steep learning curve... it's not all just shoot shoot shoot...FSB 2, similar to the 1st game, has elements of P2W but I think you can hold your own, without spending money, if you are a good enough player. If you enjoy the game, I recommend learning the basics of team-play if you want to advance any further: passing, rotating, defense, etc... like i said, it's not all just shoot shoot shoot steal steal steal...About the community... this game is sadly filled with a lot of kids who talks a lot of trash and have big egos... It's like high school all over again... everyone has their own ""cliques"" that they play with and will kick anyone else out (sadly, sometimes I don't blame this type of behavior because a lot of players don't bother to learn the game correctly so they become a liability to the team, therefore leading to no one wanting to play with them). I don't suggest you visit the forums of this game, especially on the gamekiss website, it's so toxic... Overall, I like the FSB series... but the horrible community and lack of competent players/teammates can make it frustrating for newcomers... If you have friends who are willing to go through the ups/downs of the game with you, I think FSB can be very enjoyable experience...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At first,when i saw the game i was like,OHMIGOD THIS LOOKS SO AWESOME I CAN'T WAIT TO DOWNLOAD THIS RIGHT NOW!Oh how wrong i was...Ok so let's start with this. This is not NBA basketball,this is street Basketball,which basically means 3v3 on one court 5 minute basketball matches,no fouls,no overtimes,no free throws. The gameplay is really fun,addictive and easy to understand,but hard to master. There are 5 classes for you to choose,plus 3 more if you want an advanced class of sorts. The game has MMORPG elements such as skills(fade away,double clutch etc)and things like tricks that can be used for doing 3pts or dunks or blocks (Twister,The Shot,etc). Plus you have a level up system,which awards with attribute points so you have better chances of doing 3pts dunks or blocks.But once you realize the faults of this game,you are better off uninstalling it.First off,the game is Pay-to-Win-ish,a F2p game for me should have at least micro-transactions for cosmetics and stuff like that,not for special characters like point guard son goku over there.Second,the game has a lot of bugs,connection issues,freezes,which need to be fix ASAP.Third,the community i say is more like CS:GO's and LOL's community long lost son who was adopted by an Asian. It's filled with ungrateful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s,12 year old's who say that they are ♥♥♥♥ing your mom,and just toxicity all around. And it dosen't help that once you leave rookie and have an unbalance between veteran players and rookies (basically think of it as a Team of LVL 12 novices vs LVL 50 veterans)Fourth. BITCOIN MINERFifth. HACKERS. I have at least spotted 3 hackers in 3 games. If this doesn't get fixed,it will be S4 League all over again.In conclusion,without the Hackers,the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community,the bugs,the Bitcoin Miner,and the skill gap when you leave rookie servers. This game would be better than an NBA game for at least 5 years due to it's potential.It's just the potential,is stuck under the river of cons i said. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

After exiting the rookie channel, Every game you play, you will face either P2W players or hackers. Maybe at peak hour you can find some normal players. I don't know p2w, but the hacks are getting out of hands and it really destoryes the gaming experience and the game company is not doing anything to punish the hackers. This game is going down hill, with very few player base. Even at peak hour you owuld see about 30 games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game. 10/10Players 3/10The people in it? Almost like a bunch of immature brats trying their best flaming each other, looks silly, quite entertaining may I add. Pretty rare to not see: -people arguing on megaphones-people arguing in-game match (if you argued as much as you did played... -Oh, let me just stop myself)-people spamming chat-people putting down other people-arrogant players (met quite a lot of these players)-the one that talks a lot (talking [insert poop emoji])-people kicking you from the match/court whatever-toxic and salt (aka ill-mannered according to FS2)-pay-to-win/obvious pay-to-win with skills (which is not a bad thing, you invest in what you want)Where the GM's at..?I'd recommend this game, but I wouldn't at the same time. The community (not all) is toxic. There's just one event I will never forget, which scarred my life. I would be glad if the GM's removed the chat completely while in-game, or at least the ""All,"" chat because people somehow can't help it and cry or the need to trash talk.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This game to be honest isn't that bad, it's a free game so you can't expect much there are a lot of micro transactions and such but other the that the gameplay isn't bad... BUT I tried installing it on my own computer recently cause I was playing it on a different account and it was pretty sketchy, I then turned to the steam reviews to see if anyone else had this problem and I found out that it contains Bitcoin Miners. I'm not 100% percent sure what BitCoin Miners are but I have a feeling they're not too good lol. Other then that the game isn't that bad for a free to play game but if you wanna stay on the safe side then don't bother with this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quick review for those who want to try this game.Pros:+ Decent gameplay.+ Character customization.+ Nice BGM and in-match commentary.Cons:- Bitcoin miner inside gamefiles (fixed ?).- Unrealistic physics.- Pay2win: * Special Character have 40 more attribute points than normal characters. You can either get Buzzer Beater (which have no additional passive) from reaching lvl-50, purchase from the cash shop or pray to rngesus to get it from balls (similar to gacha).* Cosmestic's stats boost which cost real money to add it permanently.* Stats boost card gacha.* Skill slots which cost real money (can get from event which occur once a year[?] )Conclusion: It's a nice game to play if you have a lot of money to spend.

												It's fun for a bit and the game runs pretty well. I only experience small amounts of latency issues that really changed the tide of the match but it was rare. My true gripe with the game is the balancing as you level up, not so much the balance once you're at the top of level and have unlocked all the skills and attributes. During the first few levels on the beginner server, the game is fun but it's ruined by ball hogs and people who don't understand the sport or the game at all. I think out of 50+ Matches I had in the beginner server, very very few of the matches were competitive. Either your team stomped the other team or your team got stomped because you were paired up with people who didnt understand the fundamentals to the game (would try to do half court shots with a C, SG's would just stay under the rim for a rebound) But the games that were closer in score were actually really fun. Once you're fresh out of the beginner server, thats when the game gets even worse, you still have people who don't understand the game at all but not only that, you are matched up against people who have unlocked very strong skills that you don't have access to until you grind out several dozen matches. These skills literally make the player exponentionally overpowered compared to the skills you have when you are a fresh level 12 (Alley-Oop spam, Back Step dribble, etc.) So you have to endure through these matches because more often then not, you will be paired up with people still learning the game and have no idea how to play against teams that are already overpowered so they resort to afk exp farming. That alone is abused like heck, people just matches just to afk and get the match experience because they know they will most likely lose to higher level players. I'd love to recommend the game because it can be really fun, but it just gets worse until you get to much higher level and everyone balances out and the game becomes more skill based. But enduring the grind of the early levels coupled with players that don't understand the game and the afk farm, just ruins it all for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played a lot of this game with a Gamekiss account (not on Steam). It's actually pretty fun, but I started getting BugTrap errors after I updated to Windows 10 (the game wouldn't launch). The devs said they were working on a fix. That was like 1.5 years ago. Tried every fix I could find online. Still doesn't work.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I honestly didn't care the fact that is was pay2play. It's one of the best FREE basketball games there is...Do you really wanna drop 60.00 for 2k? I mean I guess if you dropped money to win in this game. BUT for those who did not. Like, I had so much fun playing this game. None of my friends wanted to play, but ♥♥♥♥ it. This games fun af. It was all fun and games, up until you guys made it personal. How dare you mine my computer? You guys are savages. Theres no remorse, just in it for the profit. In every aspect. I will never play this game again, how yal betrayed my love for online basketball games. Just Buy ♥♥♥♥ing 2k. 2k17 is coming out. Also need a controller. But its worth it. At least 2k tells us theyre gonna hustle us.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												this game is literal trash. p2w people always have much higher stats and advantage than others. there are a ton of cheaters, and it is not in the least bit enjoyable. high elitism in the game. I DO NOT recommend this game. spend your time elsewhere.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												UPDATE!!!!!!!!!! --- It seems someone else noticed what i wrote below. They implemented 2 new channels, of which one is for real rookies without lvl 12 char in account only. This seems very wise and good decision. Unfortunately i allready have a char above 12.....(which is ridicoulisly fast achieveable.)OLD VERSIONS CRITIC:Game mechanics and stuff others may explain. Basically theres 3 ""tiers"" ""leagues"" for competive mode, which is the main event of this game, allthough you can play with and vs AI. I recommend AI-Game-Mode but the competive mode, the main dish so to say, sucks. I will explain. 1. This game is PAY 2 WIN, At first you might not see it directly but in later game you notice it is. The 3 Tiers are Rookie, Major and Pro. Rookie League: Either real noobs like you and me, with different outcome and so on. +Pro's with their new characters. In Rookie League some of them say stuff like ""OMG OMG WORST SF EVER"" ""LEARN TO PLAY!"" and many many harsh things. They dont bother to explain what exactly you did wrong and so on.  Even if you are C and they are SG and you dont manage to rebound EVERY ball, just maybe 50-60% it can happen easily that they start to flame. In Rookie League. Without asking your level or experience. Without explaining, without giving help.  If you manage to hit lvl 12 quick, which is easy done, the heat is on. Major League. If you mess up here, be prepared to see many censored lines^^ Next thing: Even on EU Server, you see many many Russians. And they as unfriendly as a drunk russian could be.If you dont want to sink lots of cash into the game, dont have many friends you can form a crew with and learn together with and as good as allways play together or have a thick fur or dont plan to play further than Rookie or Major League, stay away from this game. Call a friend. Play ball in RL. You might not dunk, but you might be able to end the next guy who flames you without reason or explanation.  Had fun for  a week of exstensive playtime, but that community is the worst i ever encountered.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I used to play this game years ago. It was fun. It still is, aside from the obnoxious music. And the fact that I've only been able to actually get connected to the server ONCE. Frequently hangs while trying to connect to the server. Until the servers are fixed, I wouldn't bother with it. Has potential to be a good game like it used to, the music ruins it, and the horrible servers need a lot of work. I'd wait a bit longer before playing this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												IGN:  Valioa ( Level 50 PG Clara Balanced Type, Known for magical diving catches)( ' w ' ) / Ladies and Gentleman. \ ( ' w ' )  This is a game in which you start out as a trainee, learning the ropes of the game, most likely losing a lot (well, it depends if you are playing with total strangers), and as you ""go on"", you just get better and better, eventually winning.Like I said above, don't expect to be good at the start, and PLAY with friends!  This game is  heavily team-based, featuring 3v3 basketball matches that can get hectic pretty fast in the long run, especially in the pro channels.When I started out in the game, I didn't like how bad I was, and how bad my teammates were sometimes. But its ok. I came out on top, became one of the best at my position (Point Guard), and I believe I am well known in the FS2 community xD.  ITS ALL ABOUT PERSERVERANCE...!NEVER GIVE UP!  Create the best freestyle 2 team out there with your friends young padawan.  Heck, maybe even join a crew (The ""Bruh"" Crew, lead by Left-Eye is a really good start, a crew that allows anyone willing to learn the game a chance at getting better overall)AND REMEMBER....  In Pie We Trust.™ ( ' w ' ) //			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok, first, it's really fun. But not when you created a new level 1 character and being called noob. Nevertheless, you'll level up eventually, so it's not really a problem to me. For the gameplay, it's smooth and good-looking. The graphic is weird but it does give you a fresh feeling, like, you know, first time playing a game that is made in Korea. Despite the community is a little bit bad, but, just stay strong and ignore them, like you're deaf or something. It's not a big deal, but the big deal is dealing with yourself. It's F**KING HARD to ignore them, and I've played this game for 700+ hours, you know how much pain I've gone through. But it's really fun, trust me. If you're a fan of basketball, or you love to play basketball but never had the chance to play it, it's a good game. And it becomes addictive when you play it for a several hours. So, for those who want to play it(after reading my review), please do play it with your friends, because everyone there is your rival. Only some of them are friendly(just like me), so I'll see you on the court. My name is qpJackqp in-game. Now here is the rating:Audio:7/10Graphic:7/10Gameplay:9/10(because some player afk)*I assume you guys know what is ""afk""Community:6/10Overall:8/10*Also, I spent RM120 on this game, LOL			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good game mechanics, clever concept, fantastic tutorial !!Would I recommend it? Absolutely NOT !!It is simply a PAY-To-WIN  game. Let me elaborate rather briefly.1) You can purchase skill slots to constantly have an upper hand, therefore no matter how uber l33t your opponents are, you have more options.2) You can purchase special game characters that have higher stats by default, so a special PF will always beat common Center under the rim. You will cap your rebound, they will still out-jump you etc.3) You can purchase cards that will make your character un-blockable.BONUS: The majority of players are from Turkey / Russia, two countries located mainly Asia whose players absolutely love playing in the EU server, despite there are 2 asian servers. This means ridiculous lag to players based in the EU.You will happily play the game at first and in the first 20-30 levels you will just give this the benefit of the doubt; then by the time you have learned the game you realise it's futile. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME !!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
