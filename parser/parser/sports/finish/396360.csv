												This game is about 2% of the quality of Fifa/PES titles. It's also 2% of the price. Have at it.LocoSoccer is a hilariously low-quality physics game. The enjoyment of it is in its simplicity and the stupidity that happens on most plays. For a buck, you can't go wrong but if you're really careful with your money and feel a dollar isn't worth the risk, look up the browser-based game Soccer Physics and give that a go as it's a much shorter version of the same concept. Where that is a 1-minute game, LocoSoccer ups the ante with a full on 5 minutes of gameplay per match with a team of 5. Contrary to some of the other reviews, you can switch players if you happen to read the controls (which are really like 4 buttons. I literally play this one handed).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Like foozball, but better. Mostly because you can see the look of defeat on your enemies faces.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
