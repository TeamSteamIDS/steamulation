												Okay it may be a P2W kind of game but there are ways to get stars and still it is fun to play. Yet, I am still waiting for the ""Live Ticker"" to be updated with better visuals.			",50,6,5,6,3,0,2

												It is a good football manager but there is alot room for improvments. I like the step Northworks made to bring it up on steam may that increase improvmentspeed.			",20,1,5,3,5,1,12

												Have played this game for years as a browser game. GoalUnited is a great football manager game, it may not be as in depth as other footy manager games but its great fun. Watching the live ticker in real time is actually one of its best features along with building your own stadium. 10/10 game!			",145,15,1,17,29,2,8

												Been playing for a year now. Delighted it is now available on the steam platform. Free to play bit of fun with excellent !to-do's"" like building your stadium, creating a youth school and then bringing those youth players into your first team, looking forward to more DLC's that will hopefully become available.

												Playing goalunited for several years now, and goalunited PRO is my favourite version so far. This game is what every football fan wants to have when he is at home or on the go. (yes, it's also supported at iOS and Android too).Game is complex and makes you think about everything about your football clubs. Taking care of squad, training, building best possible stadium complex, finding new youth talents, hiring best staff and so on, basically you are involved in every single bit of your football club and your decisions that you make is what matters.One more good thing about goalunited PRO is that the game is constantly getting new updates.If you are looking for a long term fun in the multiplayer football manager game, goalunited PRO is for you.

												I started playing goalunited a few years ago, and I would play for a few weeks then stop, then start again.Now I just can't help but play every few days. Since the update to goalunited PRO, the game has become one that keen football managers can become addicted to. Managing your training sessions, developing your youth squad and most importantly, making sure your team succeeds leads to a fulfilling journey with your players in the team. The game itself is basic, but I'm sure the coding behind it is complex. There may be some times where strong teams get run over by newly led clubs, but that's an issue that will hopefully be patched. Also, the merchandising system is a bit weak - it needs more attention and perhaps a new system completely. Perhaps the worst part of this game is the matchmaking - and even then it's not too bad. When I ask for a 1on1 match, my team is put with teams far stronger than I am - even when I select equal team strength. It's fine, when you are only playing a friendly. But during cup matches and International Masters it becomes a bit more infuriating.Overall, seeing this game taking the leap from web-browser to steam is inspiring. From such a small game, it has evolved into an international managing career. Hopefully most will share the same opinion as me when you jump onto this mesmerising football managing game.

												Game is not bad , but it is a simple game  and that makes boring game sometimes. Also improve your matchmaker , i am playing this game for the first day that you published it. you have the same mistakes for matchmaker like GU LEGENDS. LEGENDS lose too many players becouse of matchmaker .			",3,0,0,0,1,0,0

												Im no football manager expert, but Goalunited PRO seems like a decent manager game with what very little time I have put in. I recommend if you are interested that you just try it out for yourself in this case, that will be the quickest, most sure way to decide if you like the game or not.			",374,143,14,85,57,11,89

												GU PRO is very good game and I very appreciate to see GU PRO on Steam. If someone likes the footbal managers, I really recommend this one, because it is very addictive :DYou can use your web account to login on Steam version and you get all everything what you have on browser version.I can't say more. This game is perfect and I like it.			",50,8,2,3,11,0,1
