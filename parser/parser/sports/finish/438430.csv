												10 hr EDIT: The AI are still dumb. constantly crash into you. swerve onto the racing line when exiting the pits. They are programmed to keep their line. If you happen to be in the way then they hit you causing you to go wide or lose time. Online play is garbage. get a 'please wait' screen then after 2 to 3 mins it timeouts. managed to maybe race 2 races out of the 30 lobbies I joind.Braking is bad but I think you have to 'level up' by going thri the VR46 academy to improve braking._____________________________________________________________________________I have many hrs experience on MotoGP15.So far on 'VR the game' I have only played a MotoGP full race weekend in Assen as Valentino Rossi on the hardest settingFirst impressions and improvements over Moto GP 15:- cornering feels more realistic, you need to have all your speed removed before the turn and accelerating out of the corner feels better.- less rear wheel sliding around from side to side. As your rear tyre wears (presuming you enable tyre wear setting) it spins more and is harder to find traction but doesnt slide around from side to sidelike in motogp 15- turning into corners feels way better than in motogp15. its sharper and feels more realistic.- Audio has improved and changing down thru the gears sounds better- Graphics are better. The rider moves around the bike more realistically. Crowds are better and cheer at certain parts of the circuit.Dislikes so far:- Braking feels weak and soft and I cant brake late to overpass someone in the corner. Braking late just means running off the track. Have done all overtakes in high speed sections of the track (have tried the 2 different brake pad choices) - Background music during races was the first thing I disabled.Will play more and update the review.
