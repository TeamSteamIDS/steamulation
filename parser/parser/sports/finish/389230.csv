Early Access Review
								Game has some serious bugs. You hook the 'treasure chest' and you have to release it because you can't open it. There are 'creatures' and there is no freeplay. Slog through each and every fishing spot till you mercifully just turn off the game. Additionally there isloud  rude commentary from the 'fisherman' when you catch a fish. Broken rods, props tackle, all too common with very little start up money. Too many snags extremely loud noises. It isn't even close to what fishing is. It's not peaceful, and it isn't fun. I played for nearly two hours offline and grew so frustrated I decided it has to go.Refunded. 2/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHlwlV-V-qrn2sb-g4KhWO4nr2Xo8fKY5This is a great game, it is obvious the illusion with which it is made, and care in every detail: there are abundant types of baits, the ability to improve the boat, the lakes are varied, there is a shop .... and also has lake monsters, this is highly original and fun, the camera aerial have perspective comfortable.  Is a nice game for all publics.I recommend this game to all users, and openly congratulate the team Thirsten Studios.			",11,3,0,0,6,2,2
