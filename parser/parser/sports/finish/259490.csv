												BBT reminds me of the time when indie games weren't cool yet and still had that shareware feel. This one's a bit rough in the UI department (the menus are bad and difficult to explore with a gamepad) but it's gameplay is rock solid. And by ""rock"" I mean that the game will kick your♥♥♥♥♥repeatadely before you get good at it. It brilliantly conveys the feeling of a ring fight without taking itself seriously. Fighting system is simple but not simplistic - if you mash the same attack for a longer time each fighter will notice this and change his (its?) tatic accordingly. It all comes down to timing and proper strategy. As it should.The writing is good (even though most won't even bother to read the text), graphics are okay. The music fits the theme perfectly. What's more important is that it's really fluid and it controls well during actual gameplay. I recommend using a 360 pad - it's easier to hammer both triggers than to mash the keyboard.Well worth its price. I got it on Indie Royale as soon as it appeared. Played it on Desura before, really happy to see it on Steam.			",631,210,19,58,56,5,79

												Fun game, reminds me abit of Super Punch Out. You play a boxer and you can control side to side movement, left/right punches, types of punch, and blocking. It can be challenging at times, but with good timing, a bit of strategy, and carefully chosen upgrades, you can really tear through this game quickly. As of this review with 2.8 hours played, I've 100%'d the achievements already (including the 4 secret ones) so I'd imagine you'd get a similar amount of time out of it give or take a few hours. I don't have any other games like it, so I may go back and play it somemore just for fun.Lots of fun though, recommended if you can get it for very cheap or in a bundle. I was lucky enough to be given mine!			",357,78,12,46,44,10,57

												The immediate comparison that comes to mind when viewing this game is the NES/SNES classic ""Punchout"", and I'd say that's pretty accurate. There are a few places in which it falls short, though it does shine in a few spots as well.The art style is a probably a personal preference, but I liked it. The beasts are just wacky enough without falling into the realm of ridiculous. Animation is a little stiff, but it works. Keep in mind that this is a $4.99 game and it is not trying to be AAA. But, hey, Punchout was no ""looker"" either, right? Now, where BBT falls just short of ""Punchout"", in my opinion, is in the gameplay. I played it with a wired 360 pad and it felt great using the two triggers in combination with the thumb stick for movement and punches. I'd have to level my criticism mainly at the lack of complexity in the enemy fighters. While each has a signature attack, it's not hard to win each fight with the same jabs and crosses. Once you defeat the game, a game+ mode unlocks and it does get a little tougher from there, but the action remains pretty straightforward.One thing BBT does well is that it presents you with many training options that allow you to boost your stats with money earned from fights. Watch out though, because it's fairly easy to overlevel and fights become even easier. You may also purchase new gear that changes the look of your fighter (in-menu... all fighting is done first-person) and gives you even more stat boosts. All in all, I enjoyed the game. There aren't many games in this genre, so fans will probably want to check it out.			",2014,702,82,223,223,19,327

												Beast Boxing Turbo is the PunchOut or Wii Sports Boxing for the PC. It controls pretty much the same way as those games and it has the same looks as PunchOut and actually manages to look a bit cooler thanks to the variety in opponents, even if there are only 12 of them. The game really is beautifully rendered, but the fact that the backdrops and the crowds are in 2D is a bit disappointing.You can use the mouse or controller to land your punches and there's an extensive tutorial to help you ease into the game. Except that, by the game you reach the 10th opponent - and at the same time the last tutorial - the game is almost over. Yes, there's a New Game+, but it's still a shame if you're not into stuff like that, or simply do not have the patience to go through it again.Defeating opponents rewards you with money. Money that can be used to upgrade your character by training at the gym or by buying equipment. By the time you reach the last opponent you're probably already strong enough to take him down the first time. My advice; don't spend your money on equipment, just use the money at the gym to make your character stronger.I praise the developer for not letting me grind in order to defeat the last opponent. But at the same time I wish it was made more difficult. Because Beast Boxing Turbo is a fun game, but a short one. Two hours and you're done with it. I really, really, really hope there'll be a sequel, with more opponents, a better tutorial system (or more opponents after the tutorial) and more incentive to keep fighting (or to do rematches). Even with its 2 hours of playtime BBT has become one of my favorite games.[Rating: 84/100]			",1658,633,69,221,194,16,225

												Super Punch Out!! always seems to be forgotten by people when listing off the SNES's best titles. To be fair it's up against some stiff competition, but to this day SPO is still an incredibly fun and polished gem that has sadly faded from most people's memories. The developers of Beat Boxing Turbo clearly remember it though, with their game being clearly and highly inspired by Nintendo's boxing puzzle game, with a bit of Fight Night mixed in for a colorful arcade feel that reminded me why I miss SPO so much. It's in no way a perfect replacement, but it's an admirable effort and a surprisingly fun time!So you want to box? Well tough luck, human, there's no place for your kind in the ring! Under a disguise though no one would stop you, and thus you enter the world of beat boxing in an attempt to make a name for yourself and prove humans have a place in the sport.As the name suggests, this isn't straight boxing, but somewhere between the over the top feel of the before mentioned Punch Out and a simple arcade recreation of the sport. Your collection of moves is small and the way to utilize them equally limited, but you're given just enough variation to be able to plan out various moves, and counter the attacks of your beastly enemies (which true to form all have their own special attacks and fighting styles). It's easy to learn and honestly pretty easy to master as well, which actually becomes an issue after a point as fights become cake walks and the CPU's way to counteract this is to rely on cheap hits and forcing you into corners that never feel particularly fair. It's disappointing the difficulty fluctuates from such extremes, but when it's not beating you in the face without remorse the ease of conquering your opponents never became hugely unsatisfying.As a budget priced game there have been some obvious cuts and as a whole the amount of content here is slim. Perhaps most disappointing is the absence of any multiplayer mode, which seems an obvious addition that could have extended the hour or so story mode a lot further. Other issues arise in the clunky combat, that isn't a problem generally but on higher difficulty levels leads to a lot of cheap KO's. Some recycled character models/frames are a bit tacky as well, but the cartoon artstyle mostly makes up for the corners that have been cut off the presentation.Irregardless, Beast Boxing Turbo is worth recommending if only for how unique it is to the platform, and for how fun it is while it lasts. It's far from the classic that is Super Punch Out!!, but as that is a sequel itself perhaps it's only a matter of waiting for Beast Boxing 2 for it to reach that point. In the meantime I'll be over here punching pigs in the face.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. ",845,336,29,79,64,6,112

												Really fun game! Definitely recommending it for when it's on sale.This game is a love letter to Super Punch out, and it nails it pretty damn well. Character design's awesome, the punching feels good and there's a decent block/dodge system. There's also upgradable gear and skills which are a very nice touch.There's also a decently told story that the devs could've easily cast aside, but they didn't, and I appreciate that a lot. The dialogue's pretty funny. I only wish the game was longer, since it's legitimately fun.And your boxer girl's pretty cute, so there's a plus. :3			",406,63,4,42,22,4,19

												A game very similar in looks and gameplay to Punch-Out!!! with interesting characters, really good core gameplay, and a decent progression system. The price is right, the game is fun, and although it's not very long, I enjoyed every second of it. Highly recommended at the current price and on sale it's a complete no-brainer. A little bit more variety in the people you fought would be nice - there's not a lot of difference between characters the way there is in Punch-Out, but that doesn't detract much from an awesome game.9/10			",473,90,5,45,26,6,34

												If you remember 'Mike Tyson's Punch-Out' (or just 'Punch-out' depending if you bought the game after Tyson went to prison) from the NES era than this will feel pretty familiar right from the start.  I won't bore you with details but I will say that though this is a fun game, it's far too easy to complete.  Even the NewGame+ was a cakewalk.  And, the lack of any real punch variety makes the fights feel like deja-vu over and over again.  No special moves/punches, no southpaw, and no real sense of accomplishing anything through training accept for making a number larger are all dissapointments as well.  And there is absolutely no multi-player (local or online).  So much potential here but unfortunately it's lost somewhere.			",3572,1390,135,346,492,44,515

												For a lower budget title, this is a fun Punch-Out style game. The combos don't feel as tight and timing isn't as strict, but it is the closest thing you can get to punch out without having to fire up an emulator. The beast design is good, and while the story doesn't win any awards, it never gets in the way. Having to grind  for equipment and stats to beat the final boss is a nice touch to extend the game, but with only 12 monsters you will probably just play until you get strong enough to finish him off. The new game mode increases the difficulty, but appears to only increase the stats of the monsters, not really their moves or attack styles. Equiping items is a pain too, you have to scroll through items one by one, in no order sorting out all your items in your head. Slots for each equipment piece would be better, but you can visibly see your equipment change in the menu as well as in the ring, which was a nice touch.			",835,207,20,100,87,8,125

Think punch-out with out the rampant cheating (kicks and 1 guy used a cane) though in this game your the one cheating simply by being human.Fight your way past racism and a string of 12 faces only a mother could love.Your many skills involve punches, hooks, and uppercuts (no body blows) wile you block and dodge to the sides.Each bout gives cash you can spend on training skills or buying new mutant gear.

												The other day I had the inclination to hit something. Bouncing around the house with a lot of energy makes me want to expel it in different ways. I'm not a boxer myself but thinking about it made me remember this game and I'm glad I did.Beast Boxing Turbo is a fun little fighting game. There aren't many boxing games out there but this is one of the good ones. Your character's story is that she wants to participate in the Beast Boxing fight circuit but since humans aren't allowed you're fighting incognito. Your goal at first is just to prove you're as good as any beast as you just want to be accepted but of course you turn out to have mad boxing skills then get the idea that you can actually be the best. A rags to Rocky story if you will.Controls are tight and even though you can get by with pretty much just jabs you face an good variety of fighters that have their own unique moves and fighting styles. You fight in a first person view reminiscent of Super Punchout, if you're old enough to remember that. You can also buy equipment and train to increase your skills. I play this with a gamepad and the controls feel natural and responsive.If there was one area I feel that this game falls a bit shot in is that I would have enjoyed if the training exercises included a short mini-game of some sort so it adds a bit of play time and variation to just straight boxing matches. Another thing I feel that could have been a bit of an improvement was if there was some need to use other punches besides the jab. You can do uppercuts and hooks. Even though those punches are more effective when they do hit they tend to be slower and easily dodged by the majority of the opponents you face.Other than that this game is fun to play albeit is pretty short. One playthrough will take you about 90 minutes. There's no grinding involved. The story is peppered with humor and the characters you face have a surprising bit of personality as well. Overall it's a really good boxing game.			",460,285,7,85,41,7,68

												There are four types of indie games - bad indie game, ""meh, just another indie game"", good indie game and ASTONISHING indie game. And surprisingly - Beast Boxing Turbo is representing the last type. First of all - gameplay is gorgeous. From the very beginning. Control is simple and intuitive (you need to pass through tutorial, but it's painless). Every match is very engaging and entertaining - some of them can be considered as too easy though, due to limits of AI (you can find some gaps in behaviour of your opponent), but don't worry - overall, it's still challenging experience.It's incredible, that with relatively small amount of mediocre graphic  you can have so much remarkable and well animated characters. It's for sure not the most beautiful game in Steam library, but believe me - it's not bothering at all.I really like music in this game - some themes are so memorable, that I like to listen them even long after beating the game.As you probably guessed, this game is not too long. And that's unfortunately true. It has some replayability value, but still - I really would like to see more in-game opponents and multiplayer mode, but unfortunately, it seems that we can't count on any of those things in future.Nevertheless - just for satisfactory and juicy gameplay I can recommend this game without hesitation. For everyone - due to its quite simple control and entertaining gameplay.			",540,128,20,67,28,3,105

												TL;DR: A fun action boxing game with a short career mode.Set in an alternative universe with slums, aliens and monsters, you become the slum girl who wants to participate in the beast boxing tournament: boxing for monsters and only monsters, because humans are viewed weak and not up to the challenge. Thus a human wouldn't be able or even allowed to try their brawn in the ring. How's the girl going to fight the discrimination? Dressing up as a monster, of course!The fight for equality aside, the story is very basic with the unlikely protagonist rising and training hard to become a champion. Albeit basic and familiar in a sense, the story is still very nicely presented and interesting to see through. Music and sound effects fit the setting well. The game itself is really fun action boxing! One important thing keeping you hooked until the end is the career mode, which is also the main mode of the game. You start fighting in rings against lowest of the lowest opponents and even in higher difficulty levels the opponents will easily fall in front of you. Not going to how this is fairly unrealistic (the protagonist being a teenager against bigger monsters), but the fights sure are a lot of fun. It's surely not a simulation but it's not trying to be one anyway: for realism you might want to look elsewhere. The opponents are talking pigs, aliens, turkeys, all kinds of vaguely bipedal fantasy monster races. There are even some ridiculous ones like a skeleton and a treeherd. They are hilarious and fit the theme well. All opponents have different attributes, like strength, health and speed and their own special attacks. Other than that, they are a bit too similar. There are basically just two archetypes: the speedy one and the heavy hitter, who might or might not require a different tactic to beat them depending on your difficulty setting.Fighting is straightforward and easy to understand and works like fluid playing with a keyboard. You (and your opponents) may attack with any of the more or less familiar boxing strikes, like jabs or hooks. It's important to keep track of your stamina, which drains when punching or taking hits but also replenishes fast when not attacking. You win a round by emptying the opponent's health bar by landing punches and not letting the opponent do the same to you by blocking and dodging.The AI can be nasty: it fights you giving fast punches when you're preparing for a strong strike and doing heavier hits when you are down. It even learns to anticipate your strikes if you don't change your strategy often enough. It was still fairly easy to shoot a hook at them when they're approaching and they would almost never see that coming, even when repeating the action.One thing about the AI bugs me though: when the opponent is low on health they'll retreat to a corner. They will stay there so you have to follow them. When you do, they will always give you a punch or two and then retreat to the opposite corner. This exploitative tactic was really annoying when trying to finally down the opponent and call it a round.In the story you get a couch who teaches you some important techniques (i.e. game mechanics) in the practice (tutorials). As the story goes on, your previous opponents decide to join your dojo and teach you more things. This is a nice and convenient way of handling the tutorials.As you progress you win money, which you can use to train and buy equipment. The monster boxing rules don't seem to mind the fighters having some extra equipment while in the ring, though they are otherwise honourable to the basic rules of boxing. The equipment makes you e.g. stronger or faster but can also penalize you while giving higher bonuses to other things. Likewise, training naturally also makes you stronger and helps you especially when facing the highest tier foes.If you really get into the game there is the endless mode, in which you just fight opponent after opponent without healing or upgrades until you inevitably drop, trying to last as long as possible. You can then track your score on global leaderboards and compete for the highest place.Having only 12 opponents, the game is unfortunately quite short: myself, I finished it (all achievements) in 4 hours and having played through New Game++: the career mode can be start anew with the previous upgrades but stronger opponents. Still, this can only last so far.For longevity it would need more opponents, a longer career mode and more distinct difficulties (frankly I saw little difference between normal and hard). Perhaps playing different characters or having multiplayer would be cool as well. Here's for hoping there will be a sequel that addresses at least some of these issues.For the glorious full price of 5 bucks though the price is still good, and on sale it's even better! For the short time it lasted for me it was a blast, an excellent choice for killing a few hours for fun.			",3011,1259,77,374,381,26,452

												If I had one complaint about this game, it would only be that it's too short. However I'll also say that the Continue+ mode, Endless mode and several difficulty levels mitigates this as well as it can.I usually judge a game based on 5 criteria, listed in order of important: Gameplay, Controls, Replayability, Sound & Graphics.Gameplay: As many people before me have said this is definitely an homage to Punch Out from the slew of eccentric and quirky characters to the first person boxing mode. The gameplay though is very tight. The AI doesn't feel like it cheats, there's no psuedo difficulty or anything of that nature. The AI learns from your patterns and which attacks you're using most and will guard against it in the current and next round, forcing players to avoid a specific pattern or style of play.Controls: You can rock the keyboard or you can rock a gamepad, fully customizable and absolutely no complaints here. Controls are such an important part of a game, they can make a game or break it and while you might think it's standard practice to allow customizable controls, it's the few games that don't that stand out like a sore thumb. Thankfully this game isn't one of them.Replayability: As long as you're in the mood for the game, there's content there to play. From exhibition missions to completing/replaying the story, or trying your hand at endless mode. The only thing I can foresee ruining this is becoming bored with the game itself which will happen, as with most games, eventually.Sound: The sound effects are definitely on point and the music is about what you'd expect: standard background music that you actually hear for a few minutes and then start tuning out after that.Graphics: The graphics for this game are great. They're not super polished high end but for what they are they look awesome and I had a ball seeing new characters and the blending of art for story and 3d in the ring.Overall on a scale of 0-10, I'd give this game an 8.

												Not played many boxing games but this one does the mechanics fairly well with its attacks but sadly the fights in the game become mostly strafing away from your opponent and spamming your attacks at the right time. With more limited movement the fighting could have been a fair bit more interesting and challenging.  The games story mode contains about 12 fights in increasing difficulty and adding new abilities step by step, but due to needing to upgrade your skills and equipment the game becomes a bit grindy and repetitive. The story itself along with the games graphics are sound are mostly passable and don't really add much to the game.Contains the usual progression achievements along with some stuff for doing fights in a certain way. It also has three difficulty achievements that thankfully all unlock if you beat the game on the hardest difficulty.Time to 100%: 3-4 hours			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
