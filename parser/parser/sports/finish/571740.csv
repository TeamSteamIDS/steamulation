								One of the best golfing games, had some good laughs with friends! 10/10 if you are playing with friends.Here are some changes/improvements I'd like to see:[important]- decrease the cannon angle from 360° to 180° so you vaguely know where to shoot- when the ball is close to certain walls, the ball can be seen through it but the golf club can't be seen. Therefore you can't calculate your shot properly.- when inviting friends, list players who are currently playing the game at the top and those who own it below. Please don't show players in the invite list who don't own the game!- players should return to the lobby when a map is finished, so the lobby leader does not have to create a new lobby each match.[optional]- add a description to the different golf strokes in >Options>Stats- add the ability to change the colour of your golf club- add the ability to control some moving objects when you scored a par instead of spectating players. example: Control the speed of a minecart // change speed and/or rotation of spinners- add a team-based mode where up to 4 teams battle each other to score the least strokes.

								The game is still early access but it is pretty solid so far, I have only played solo so far a few rounds just to get used to the mechanics of the game. I found I had to turn up the putter movement from 5 to 20 because it just took to much eeffort to hit things hard.The one thing I would love seeing is Jumping like GWF, that simple mechanic makes it so much fun to try to cheat the maps. Some small tweak I would say is decrease the ball size and the hole size because that hole is the size of a basket ball net.I would recommend people to get this game if you enjoyed GWF, making your own holes?! sold!

Number One Complaint I've ReadThe number one complaint I've read about this game is the controls for putting the ball. I went in thinking it would take me a few hours to get the hang of it. It took me about 30 seconds to understand how it worked, I cannot understand what the challenge is for some people in figuring it out. You point the ball in whatever direction you want it to go, left click to set it in place, and then the putter appears. You actually use the mouse to swing the club, so you have to move the mouse quick if you want to hit it hard, or slow to just tap the ball. It's the closest thing I've felt to actually playing minigolf, bar none, the best controls for a minigolf game. Rest of ReviewI haven't got a chance to play any multiplayer yet, as I just purchased this a little over an hour ago. I went through the first 18 course hole, Grasslands, and it was fun to play through, even on my own. None of the holes felt poorly designed, or lazy. The physics from hitting the ball never went crazy, every hit went exactly how I expected it to go, depending on how hard I hit the ball. I was not disappointed, in the slightest, with my purchase after completing that course. I look forward to seeing what the other courses look, and play, like. Also, for whatever updates are to bring to this well-crafted early access game. I enjoy Golf with Friends a lot, but this game adds more to the genre, along with a lot more customization, than GWF probably ever will. I've always wanted to enjoy a map editor with a friend, and this is the only game I've experienced with where that is finally possible. The editor is very complex, and you can get overwhelmed by the options presented to you, but if you're like me and explore/test things out, you'll figure most of it out within half an hour, at most. This editor is lacking in the tutorial department, by a lot, but I figured that will be added on at a later date. I spent around an hour just goofing around and finished designing a single hole, and was so pleased with the outcome. I haven't been this excited for a map editor since the first couple far crys.Final VerdictWith the lack of tutorials, I think that is this game's only downfall, as of right now. I didn't experience any bugs myself, but I didn't play for a long time, and I plan on pouring a lot more hours into this. The graphics were fantastic for a minigolf game, I don't know if it's the best out there, but it's the best I've seen. The soundtrack was soothing, I'm not a stickler for the game's having a poor/awesome soundtrack myself, but for other's sakes, I would say it fits with minigolf very well.I would give 'Golf It!,' in it's current state, a 8/10. After a few updates, and tutorials added for those who are having troubles with the game's controls, it will be even better. I look forward to seeing the progress of this game, and hope you enjoy it as well, should you decide to purchase it.			",112,13,2,14,8,4,0

								One of the best crazy golf games I've played.Usually I play 'Golf With Your Friends' with a few others. While 'Golf It' is slightly lacking in some of the crazier options of GWYF such as low gravity, big balls or shapes. It makes up for it with better and less bug free gameplay.Input is analogue based, moving the mouse to swing the putter. A far better method than the power-level of GWYF, where it was easy to remember a power-level and angle to get an assured hole in one. There's an option to change the sensivity of the mouse and the putter speed to your taste.The maps are interesting, fun and really good looking usng the Unreal engine to good effect. Hopefully some more graphical effects will be added later to really utilise this engine a bit more.There's a couple of holes that are really hard, particulary on the mine level, trying to get the ball onto moving carts.I'd like to see an option added in the future to decrease the size of the holes. AS it is it's a bit easy once your close to get the ball in. Making the holes optionally smaller would add a little bit more challenge for seasoned players.I tried to have a look at the editor, but I couldn;t find any way to add stuff to the new map I started. A tutorial or link to an instruction manual would be really helpful. The option to allow friends to edit the maps with you is quite original, I'm not sure if that measn you can all edit the map, or just one of you while the rest comment...or critique like the muppets I play with.All in all it is by far one of the best crazy golf games, if not the best. Pricing is spot one. ",142,27,3,21,38,6,32

 Comparing to Golf With Friends If your like me and have previously played Golf with Friends then this game will do you well. Both have differences. This game is less buggy and much more fun. There is even an option to download maps from workshop or make your own. How great is that? The controls are a bit weird at first, for someone who uses a mouse mat with a wrist rest, it makes the game awkward.   Recommend? Yes, I do. Go ahead and purchase the game. RIGHT NOW. It's worth and loads of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Love it! I have this and Golf With Your Friends and they are very similar but both super relaxing, fun, and are very worth the small amount of pocket change that they are charging for it! Couple things Ive noticed that need to be fixed. Whenever you hit pause it doesnt stop the timer on your game, the textures on the Winterland map need to be fixed so that you dont see the squares in the snow. It needs to have a simpler way of knowing if the game you hosted can have random people join it. I cant tell if the check or the x is the thing that says its a private game with just me or someone else can come barging in. It needs to have a mode where you can reset the shot so you can attempt to get a hole in one at every hole on practice mode. I see no button that says restart course or restart hole. That would be great if you dont get ranked on your score on that map. I would also like to modify my ball and my putter by colors and shapes, there might be a possibility for a store where you can buy cooler stuff but I really dont want to see this game being turned into a pay-to-play. Overall its a fantastic game for relaxing. Love that theres a good workshop for it. Yes, you should buy this game.			",86,3,3,4,13,3,0

								The best Minigolf game I have played! Ofcourse it is in Early Access and not finished yet, so small bugs might appear. But there are updates for the game almost every day! And man -  I love the Controls! It's very intuitive and unlike some other golf games , you have no bars that you can memorize on how much power you need to play! It actually feels like  playing Minigolf!There are 5 standart maps to play for now + User created Maps! But the best thing about it  is the steam workshop and map editor! There are so many Features in this game and I feel with almost every updates it's getting more and more. Since it's early Release people have created tons of very cool own maps that you can play! So this game has also user created Content like for example the Trackmania games! This makes the Gamecontent last forever! I absolutelly can not understand some of the negative Reviews here, because Feature and Mechanic wise , it's the best Minigolf game so far! The Multiplayer ( local or online! ) with collissions on - is so much fun! For like 9 euros you should really give it try!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Golf It! is a fantasy themed mini golfing game.  The graphics are very whimsical-esque and range from an underground theme to a winter wonderland theme.  The game is in Early Access but it seems to be an EA game that has a solid standing, unlike other games that have weak releases or are very VERY early Alpha demos.   There is not a whole lot to say about the game, mostly due to its nature so I will list the pros and cons and then have a final note.Pros:Easy to pick up and easy to playDecent graphics that look good enough to enjoy without being hyper realisticInteresting map themesMini golf sandbox (will talk about later on)Steam Workshop capable[[*]Devs have positive attitudeConsCertain levels dont feel balanced but no biggieMinor bugs and glitchesNot much variety or challenge once you beat each courseMusic used for each map theme gets very annoying after the first few times of hearing itFinal thoughts:    I saved this part for the last since this is the biggest and best feature that the game has going for it.  Gold It! has a sandbox mode where you can make your very own golf course.  I only spent a few minutes on it but for those who have always wanted to make their own mini golf course design, this is for you.  You can choose a bunch of assets and visual effects and what not.  There are people who have already made a bunch of maps already, many of which are very enjoyable to play.   When I have time, I plan on trying it out myself, but for now, its a great feature for those with the will to make a course.In short, this game has a fair price and offers a few hours of entertainment, more if you are into creating your own maps.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys some casual mini golfing and for those who enjoy creating maps.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I don't really want to give this game a thumbs down, but I can't recommend it when I feel there's another very very similar game that does what this game tries to do, but better. Golf With Your Friends is cheaper, and quite frankly is the superior game when it comes down to it. Normally, I wouldn't mind some flaws, but this game has two major cons that I don't think will be able to be fixed without MASSIVE reworks to the entire game, sadly. First and worst of all, the level design is extremely unforgiving. I don't mind a challenge at all, but this is mini golf. Meant to be a casual game to play with friends. I think maybe in the first level on maybe hole 4 or 5, you'll see the start of an awful trend in these levels. There are MANY many times when you work your way to a hole, usually taking a few strokes to get there, only to find that if you make a mistake on the last stroke, the level will send you back to the very START of the level. It's extremely frustrating, and quite frankly too unforgiving in a game for casual minigolf. Some more signs of unforgiving level design. There are QUITE a few spots where there's just holes in the map for what seem like the sake of frustrating you and your friends. This isn't inherently bad, but it's used MUCH too often in this game I'm afraid. And worse still, there are a couple holes that are quite literally just RNG/memorization. I REALLY do not appreciate that kind of design in just about any game. By RNG, I mean pick a hole to go in, and it shoots you out to your death or back to the start of the level. Now, many minigolf type things do this, but in this game, its either you pick the right one and go to the hole, or you just fall into a pit and lose a stroke or are taken back to the start. I will be fair on that last one, however, that there's not many RNG/memorization holes. Maybe 2-3, but, still, it shows off a lack of understanding to level design. The next major con is the physics. The physics are not terrible by any means, don't get me wrong, but they're just not good enough, I'm afraid. When putting, you're meant to sort of ""flick"" your mouse and how hard you ""flick"" it is how hard you will send the ball. Unfortunately with this style, it is VERY hard to be precise with your power, and with the horrendously unforgiving level design that DEMANDS precision, it makes for an even more frustrating experience. The ball itself also REALLY does not like to stop rolling. This is a big problem as well since most rounds are timed. I actually found myself having to increase the standard time by one minute simply because of these wonky physics. It also makes for a lot more downtime between shots, which isn't fun either I'm afraid. I'll give a brief view on the Pros, though. The graphics are great. It's a nice looking game. The level editor is a super idea. The online is also quite good, however the UI needs work. (Have to start and host a new game every time a map is finished.) My recommendation is just get Golf With Your Friends. It's cheaper, has better physics (slightly!) and has much better and more forgiving level design suited for casual golfing with well--your friends.  The graphics are not as pretty, and the online can be a tad wonky, but I don't find that to be a major downfall personally. There is no level editor in that game, yet sadly, so if a level editor makes or breaks your decision, then I suppose go for Golf It! for now. I assume Golf With Your Friends has plans for a level editor in the future. Sorry for the downer review, it's not a bad game by any means, but simply feels inferior. Maybe the devs will prove me wrong and fix the issues I have with it now, but in its current state, I wouldn't recommend picking up this game.			",350,133,7,51,31,7,46

								Finally, a minigolf game with a swing interface that requires some skill and adds an incredible amount of depth to the play.  You have a developer who is constantly adding new features while squashing bugs in multiple, weekly updates!  Not only that, the dev actually listens to customer feedback, replies to discussions and implements many of the user suggestions in new versions plus he's a genuinely good guy:).  The multiplayer with friends is super solid, haven't had a single connection issue and pace of play is very quick which is a good thing.  With the integrated course designer that allows you to create the course of your dreams (or live cooperative design with friends, unbelievably cool) there should be a huge variety of course freely available to play as the game continues to develop a following.As good as the game is now there are some things that can use more tweaking.  I've recently been playing a round or two on Friday nights with a small group of friends and the most common complaint I hear while on Discord is that at times the golf ball doesn't bounce off walls with enough energy.  Another one is that the ball can take too long to come to a complete stop when on a slight grade.  Fortunately, these are both simple issues that I have no doubt will be addressed.  If you've bored to death of the same courses in GWYF and want a mini golf experience that requires a bit more skill you will absolutely love Golf It!    ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's unlike any other golf game and it's amazing in my eyes.What about map makers?The editor has multiplayer!? I did not expect that from this game at all! Yes, it's a bit buggy and a little glitchy here and there but it works amazingly well! The only thing I wish for in that (which it is under development) is that when you duplicate an object, it keeps it's properties instead of resetting to the default (ex. candles, rotators, transformers, etc.).The steam workshop integration allows for hours of amazingly fun gameplay and you should definitely gather a few friends and play a game!

								I wasnt sure about a minigolf game cuz no game ever could beat the fun of a real life minigolf game with some friends and some beers, but I was kinda wrong. Me and my friends had lots of fun playing this game and creating our own maps, which kinda feels like minecraft in a social way (just my opinion). Sure they still have to fix some bugs, but those 2 guys are bringing updates like every day, so I am sure this is one of the best minigolf games you can get at the moment. Keep it up.

								This game has so much potential. Sure, the mechanics aren't working properly every single time, which can be depressing sometimes. But the solution to it is just a matter of time. And the Editor has great potential aswell. I mean ... hello MULTIPLAYER EDITING! Best idea ever. I am looking forward to the future of this game. Gret thanks to the developer for this game.

								Better than golf with friends in almost every way, collision makes more sense, graphics much better, the different elements and physics (particularly in the ice level) are spot on and the sounds are amazing in comparison... There are a few bugs to work out where balls don't reset when hit out or in the water and some tweaks like lobbies persisting after a game is concluded to more easily start a new one Overall highly recommended			",50,6,5,3,17,3,13

								After numerous updates the game now, has a lot of potentialThere are a few Negatives:Not being able to see the ball in certain areas because trees or foilage is blocking your view.Workshop map makers tend NOT to check their maps before releasing, leaving areas unplayable, and forcing you to quitThe good news is:You can create your own maps, and even edit the errors on those worshop mapsAs long as you do not play with overly serious competitive players, you will really enjoy the game ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game is one of the best mini golf games ever, theres so much customization. You can even make your own maps! The editor is very simple. And the way you control your ball is amazing, You have to actually hit the ball with your mouse, this game is more realistic with controls that any other game. Even in early beta this game will compete with other games. If you like Golf With Friends you will like this game better!!!!			",24,2,0,1,7,2,5

								The exclusion of a power bar adds so much longevity to the game. You can't just memorize where to aim combined with what power in order to score a hole in one. The power is based off of your own physical motion, making each shot unique. Also, the ability to create and upload your own custom made courses is amazing. So much can be done in this game. 10/10 would stroke again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Right now I do not recommend this game. I compared it with Golf with Your Friends(as this is its main competitor) which I already have and thought this was better which apparently I was wrong. Due to this I will currently not recommend it at all to my friends but here's a compare and contrast listSimilar: Same conceptSteam Achievements(not a big factor)number of courses(excluding the workshop levels for this)can play alone or with friendscan invite friends into gamesprivate roomsHow Golf with Your Friends is better: Better control over powercan infuriate yourself and friends with different golf ball shapes and sizes$3 cheaperbigger roomsno need for a controller to play goodcan remove limitscan change angle while putting on powerAll holes are playable(Golf It! has some(or at least a bug) that you have to wait out time to advance as you can't hit the golf ball(hole 12 and onward on winterland at least))How Golf It! is better: Level editorchange trail(like this feature)higher limitsallows ball to continue after time is up if hit beforeBasically I say buy Golf with Your Friends since it is easier to control power, and angle without needing a controller, has less glitches or bugs, and should only infuriate you if you are trying to have it infuriate you. I thought this would be better I can't wait for the update that makes this worth the extra $3 over Golf with Your Friends.			",130,55,11,28,12,1,5

								got this gifted to me by the amazing Bowler4Ever so thanks first and foremost to him! I expected this to be a superior iteration of Golf with Friends but so far it isn't at all...but this is in early access so there is room and time for improvement. I couldn't even successfully swing my club most holes the swinging mechanics are ,at least to me, very much broken at this point. another gripe I have(but they fixed with an update right after my recording) is not being able to play in 1920 x 1080 resolution. running in the crazy resolution it pushed everything on my second screen into non-existance so I didn't notice how cropped my OBS recording was. check out my video if you wanna see someone attempt to hit the ball and fail 99% of the time. guess I am going to have to watch a video tutorial to be able to hit the damn ball because the instructions were not helpful in the least. I expect good things from this game and have hopes for it yet still!

			If you think Golf with Friends is 2016 then this may be the golf game of 2017. I wouldn't know because I am too much of a derp to be able to figure out how to swing my club.

								Granted, this is early access, will change review when its not.Pros:-Looks good-Varied environments-Music's fitting-Thankfully there's a putter sensitivity slider-Can be fun as a online 'party' game with friendsCons:-The putting mechanics are too unreliable-Wanting to putt at a certain power level is complete guesswork-Using a trackpad may be problematic-Small desk/workspace for your mouse may be problematic-The ball friction is really odd and frankly irritating: The ball slows down really quickly, then continues to roll really slowly for some reasonBugs:-Chat is buggy. Sometimes you get stuck in the chatbox and cant leave it until you alt tab out and back, and doesnt allow that many characters on screen per lineNotes:-Be careful not to hit your mouse on anything. Change the sensitivity options otherwise you may break somethingWould recommend at a later date once its fully polished and has a better putting system.			",80,17,0,4,7,2,6

								If you have friends on Steam who own this, you'll probably have fun with this game. If you are solo, not interested in groups and/or from America you probably want to skip this game. This feels like a Euro only game, next day response times to forums posts backs up this theory. To me, Golf with Friends currently appears to be the most popular mini-golf game going and has lots of people playing in all timezones. For now I rate this game low and not recommended. People are more interested in making maps than have pub games and the attitude bestowed to me is people buy it to play on private LANS. To me playing on your own is boring so I'd rather stick to Golf with Friends. It's still early in dev for this game so it's understandable nobody really knows about it yet. Maybe in a few months time things will change.			",217,8,9,16,15,3,19
