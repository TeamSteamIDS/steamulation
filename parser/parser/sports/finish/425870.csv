Early Access Review
								Gyrodisc Super League is Valiant Interactive’s early access and Steam debut. It’s an exciting and vibrant arcade sports game in which players throw a disc from one side of the field to the other and attempt to make the opposition miss the disc to score. Games are played similarly to tennis with singles and doubles matches. The game has the potential to be one of the best couch multiplayer sports games on Steam with the fast, frantic action becoming very addictive and laugh a minute.I did not particularly enjoy the experience of the single player game. The reason for this is simple. It’s far too shallow at this stage of development. You can play individual matches against an AI opponent and that is it. However, to the developers credit they are aware of this and are incorporating an ‘Arcade mode’ that will include multiple unlockable costumes for each character as well as a selection of mini-game modes that have been inspired by classic arcade games like breakout and space invaders. This sounds good in theory but I’d love for them to include a season mode. I find that these games are so much more exciting when you’re constantly battling to win matches in order to finish on top of the ladder and/or to reach the playoffs so that you can win a tournament. Examples of recent games that feature great arcade season or tournament modes include Rocket League (to be featured later on the Steamified Countdown) and Kopanito All-Stars Soccer which we featured back on January 7. It’s a very basic concept but it adds a lot of replayability to your game.What is present in the game already is definitely enough for the local multiplayer component of the game. I spent a short time playing this mode and for what it was it was certainly enjoyable. I expect that with future updates there will be even more to enjoy on this mode. It’s definitely going to be the biggest selling point for the game and while its still leaning towards more of a concept than a fully fleshed out entity it is already a lot of fun.A bit of a disappointment is the fact that the developers have no intention of incorporating an online multiplayer game. This will definitely have an impact on the size of the potential player base that the game will have. However, the action is so fast that any latency issues would make playing the game a nigh on impossibility – at least to an entertaining and enjoyable level so I can certainly understand why online multiplayer may be an impossibility for this title.At this present stage of development if you have friends to play with then purchase a copy of the game because you will already get your monies worth. If not then I’d wait for arcade mode updates and see if what people are writing about it at that time is something that you would enjoy playing.For our popular daily giveaways and similar reviews head over to http://www.steamified.com/To begin your journey through our myriad of social media join our Steam Group ",2243,882,89,270,267,28,370

Early Access Review
								Gyrodisc is both beautifully simplistic and yet full of depth. The core mechanic builds upon the likes of pong, tennis and air-hockey, but this game is so much more. While anyone can instantly understand the game at a glance, once you sit down for a match against another person the scope of the game begins to dawn on you. The gameplay is fast paced and packed with subtle mind games. Play a lame game and keep control of the centre of the court. Or try an aggressive gambit where you force your opponent to the net and challenge their reactions. If you get the read you can charge up a super move to make them pay for their predictability. It really is a great addition to any party game library, and I know I'll be loading it up to play with friends time and time again.			",258,67,4,27,17,3,38

								A hugely fun balance of challenge and entertainment. The AI and stadium design come together to make the best disc throwing game I've ever seen :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

+ Very fast-paced gameplay very similar to Air Hockey although in this you are throwing around a disc or frisbee.+ Various variants of stages which change up the game a fair bit+ Not sure if this was a bug, but the disc flies around sooooooo quickly, especially on the hockey variant level. I found this to be quite hilarious+ Good soundtrackThis game is in early access so don't' take these too seriously- Only 1 level (with some slight variants)- Only 3 characters currently- The gameplay is a bit too simple. All you can do is throw the disc in random directions, and dive to catch it. There is also the ability to lob it into the air, but as it stands this seems useless.- Since the disc moves so quickly it's very hard to anticipate where it's going or where to dive. It bounces off the walls at a very high speed and when you combine this with how small the stage is you can't really do much of anything but hope your character catches it.

Early Access Review
								Nice Party Game!Played this with a group of friends and had a blast. The game is very easy to pick up and seems simple at first, but once you start pulling off some of the more complicated shots you start to feel like there's a lot of potential for skillful plays.You can play with up to 4 people locally, plus there are options to play versus AI with customisable difficulty. The AI on the highest setting is absolutely BRUTAL.There are a few different arenas to choose from too. The standard arena feels the most balanced but the Hockey arena is probably my favourite, with the opportunity to laugh at the expense of your opponents as they fluff a shot around the back of your goal and watch it ricochet straight into their own.In general I had no stability issues as well which is always nice for an Early Access game!If you're into local multiplayer or played Windjammers back in the day then I'd definitely recommend giving this a try.

Early Access Review
								I am really pleased to find this early access game seems to have put the fundamentals ahead of the fluff. The base gameplay already feels refined. The rules and the controls are simple and quick to pick up, yet the more I play the more I uncover the potential for skilled play and complex tactics.It'd be great to have more character specials and arenas to play with but its easy to see how these can be added given there is a solid foundation in place.I'm a big fan of couch multiplayer games and it feels like Gyrodisk will be at its best played in this way. I've been enjoying playing vs the AI so far but I'll definitely get this running on the TV next time I have friends over.			",134,33,3,19,18,1,33

Early Access Review
								GSL is incredible for an early access game.The controls on both keyboard and gamepad are incredibly tight. There are a tonne of map variations at the moment, but it wouldn't be a stretch to say this game will be able to include so much more content in the future.If it looks like something you would want to play in its current state, buy it and help support the development to make it the Rocket League of extreme throwing disc mayhem.

								Having never played Windjammers, I cannot give a direct comparrison. However, as long as you're willing to judge Gyrodisc Super League on its own merrits you'll find an enjoyable and rewarading early access experience. Online multiplayer is in the early stages right now but overall this is my favorite ""WJ-like"" game. Updates are a little slow but absolutely worth the asking price as is.			",170,38,6,14,15,3,11
