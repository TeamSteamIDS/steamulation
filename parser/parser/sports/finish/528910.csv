								Buggy! Just a few minutes in, and I've already seen quite a few bugs (falling through the ground, tons of clipping, poor swing mechanics). This game is definitely not ready to be sold (despite it being an early release) especially for $20!			",15,7,0,4,10,2,0

								TLDR: LAZY EFFORT, POOR CRAFTSMANSHIP, APPARENT LACK OF INTEREST IN GOLF. ABYSMAL.Yes this title is in early access. Yes it is competing in the relatively underdeveloped ""VR Market"".That said, I have a problem when the backlog of ""VR-TEST"" Unity projects on my hardrive have a higher level of polish than what I am paying $20 for. The developers are obviously still getting to grips with the Unreal Environment.There are a lot of things wrong with Golf Pro VR. It essentially looks like something a high school student might put together for a weekend. The models are mostly basic shapes, the terrain is using low quality textures, the ""art"" assets are freebies from the asset store, the water features are using some very poorly implemented version of the free water from Unity, there are clipping issues, there are framerate issues, the Canvas object has not been implemented properly, the Tooltips are accessible only from the start screen, the course is devoid of detail, the lighting was added in as an afterthought, the skybox is a freebie, the UI is a default and the ball physics are pathetic. Apparently you can only throw a golf ball a couple of yards away.It really has no place on the Steam Store. I hope everyone who purchased this product is aware of the ability to refund.Perhaps I am being overly harsh, but when you sell a product you sell a product, and I feel like the product description should reflect the above ""issues"".It is hard for me to gauge the reasons behind such a premature release. There may be legitimate business logic in putting out something so under cooked. It is of course far more likely the developer is simply taking advantage of the market and hoping there are sufficient folks willing to hold off on refunding this a""effort"".If you are working on a Golf Product, good for you, just don't release your in house demo as a $20 purchase and expect to not get noticed.$20. Un-Fracking-Believable.			",62,42,3,1,32,3,7

								Yes it's glitchy. I couldn't find a ball on the practice range. Once I started playing the course it was better. They released it too early, but it's going to be cool and it's still fun to mess around. THey only have 3 clubs available right now, but I played through a few holes and had a good time. I expect updates will come and the game will improve. Your call if you want to jump in before it's finished or wait.			",21,11,0,0,11,2,0
