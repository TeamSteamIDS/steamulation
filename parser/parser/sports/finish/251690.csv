												I wish there were a ""depends"" recommendation option for this.For people familiar with the Amiga classic, yes I reccomend this - for nostalgia if little else. It's billed as a HD version of the original. It's not. It's a copy of the original, but not a totally faithful copy. The feel is fairly different, including but not limited to:In the original you were limited to 8 directions for throwing the ball. Speedball 2 HD has some kind of auto-aiming which I think is worse because it is requires less skill.Substitutes never seem to run out (you had 2 in the original and after that you had less players)The AI is worse - it practically ignores the scoring multiplier and the stars (AI is a lost art form in modern gaming)There are other things that can be annoying. Player auto selection can be infuriating and unpredictable. It is also buggy - sometimes the highlighted player isn't the one that moves - and not as responsive as the original. Then there's the bugs with achievements and cups (hint: never exit the game immediately after winning the league or champion's league) and the fact this game feels more like a grind to get the best players than the original where I felt a bit of skill could work against far superior teams.It's OK. It's not a classic like the original. Despite being a very similar game with HD graphics, it seems to be missing the soul of the original game and they've made changes based on making the game easier when easier isn't always better. If there were a bugfix release with a few improvements, I'd change the recommendation to a Yes. It's just too flawed for the moment.			",421,128,8,45,47,6,83

												If you love the original Speedball 2 then don't get this. It will ruin your memories.This is a terrible ""HD"" remake of the game. It is actually lacking in some features the original had, like the manager mode. What it also is lacking is any difficulty at all, you will easily steamroll every team in the first two seasons, except when you suddenly play a team that is completely maxed out when you still have very low stats.What this game also lacks is any decent graphics. Sure, they are ""HD"", even though you only get to choose from 4 basic resolutions. Sorry laptop users. But they look terrible. Bitmap Brothers games were known for their slick, stylish graphics and this game almost seems to make a mockery out of that. To add insult to injury the game is locked at 29 FPS, making it difficult for me to play for any length of time due to eye-strain (as if the graphics weren't insulting my eyes enough already).Then finally you would probably expect an HD remake to have online multiplayer. Nope... Sorry guys. All this remake offers over the original is the higher resolution/horrible design graphics. That's it. No Manager mode, no online multiplayer, no challenge, no point in buying this. Oh did I mention the game crashing, save file corruption, playing teams with identical outfits to yours making it impossible to tell them apart (and then crashing after the match), terrible intro ""video"", lack of the awesome original soundtrack...I could go on but this should really be enough for you to make your mind up. Avoid like the plague.			",314,71,13,29,31,4,60

This is not forgiveable in 2014.It's too easyThe ball velocity has been slowed downClumsy animationSo why am I still playing it?

												I must have spent thousands of hours as a kid playing this game. Never getting tired of the bone crunching tackles or the ""Ice cream"" yells. Always coming so close to winning the league and then getting stomped on by that one team. After a few failed comebacks it's nice to see someone sticking to the orginal formula but giving it a bit of polish. The addition of a 10 year career mode is a welcome addition. The new teams are brutal at first but they are beatable. It's also nice to be able to play in new arenas but somehow I can't help but be drawn back to those original steel coloured floors.They left out some stuff from the first one if memory serves, like you could bribe a match offical to give you more time on the pitch. I'm kind of sad they replaced some of the artwork too. Sadly the people who made this game are no longer around. To the Bitmap Brothers. For missing and forgotten homework, not enough sleep and most of all, Brutal Deluxe.			",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Preamble - I was an avid Amiga owner and at the time a fan of pretty much anything involving Renegade or Bitmap Brothers.This? This is a missed opportunity.It's the laziest port I could possibly imagine. The original parts of the port - the new character models and the stadium graphics are the kind of quality you would expect to see from work experience placements, not a decent studio. There has been no attempt whatsoever to update the game with modern effects, playstyles or really much of anything over the original game save a couple of powerups.So it's not a new or expanded game; it's a faithful conversion of the original, right?Well, no. It's not a very faithful or interesting remake either. The parts retained from the old amiga game appear to be a few faces and still shots (like the winning/losing graphics and the team portraits) which have either been resized and given the blur treatment, or traced very horribly. Worse, these scaled up and blurred originals contrast garishly with the new player graphics and other elements, making the whole thing seem like a poorly stitched-together hack job.The gameplay is at least loosely faithful to the original, meaning that the players are feel hard to control at first (a fair complaint to level at the original and one that sadly hasn't been improved), but they've actually managed to make the original - which gets better with practice - worse, in that it feels very floaty and unpredictable off of the ball, and simple things like catches that would at least act consistently in the 'miggy version are almost impossible to pull off as the timing on performing a catch and/or a slide seems way off.I would've hoped - since they were departing from a flat conversion by so much - they would've taken the extra mile and applied more interesting effects on the player field, and actually made a smoother analog-friendly movement and control scheme (GASP! Seperate out catch, throw and tackle buttons! Put aftertouch on the triggers or bumpers! ZOUNDS!) to actually play to the strengths of this PC platform rather than bringing all the problems of having to cater to a userbase mostly having one button joysticks.Eh, too much work it seems.So... Graphics? Miss. Gameplay? Miss. Sounds? Well, they nicked a bunch of the original ones but chucked some other stock effects in there so I'm going with miss. The gym interface is slightly better I guess. Hard to screw that up with a mouse you would think.Don't bother. Play the original on an emulator instead. You'll get a more consistent and coherent experience, and if you take a moment to scale the emulator surface at least everything will look equally stretched and blurred.			",460,115,5,87,52,5,94

												This is an awful remake of a great classic game, I recommend playing the dos verison of Speedball 2 in DOSbox over this.The controls in this game are just awful, press down and your player may go down or just some other random direction. When the computer is control of the ball, press the action key and your player may slide tackle towards the computer player or away from him. I question whether anyone bothered to test this game before releasing it.Save your money and buy something else			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The game feel, gameplay, atmosphere and even some cutscenes (like the violent images of bleeding team mates when you knock out enemy players or the team cheering after winning a game) are gone.Don't buy this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t hoping to find a remake of the original game with a better graphic (which anyways looks childish and ridiculous)Just check the other reviews, most of the people who recommends this crap is either new players which have no idea of what this game comes from or completely braindead people.Don't buy it.

												Got this as part of a Humble Bundle, and it was the sole reason I bought it.Well, needless to say it's a complete mess. After playing through the tutorial (which is hidden in the options menu, by the way), I got the jist of the scoring system. While constantly trying to put my newfound training to use, I quickly realized that running diagonaly makes the player or AI carrying the ball virtually invincible to most tackles. The AI on the player side seems to know nothing about offense or defense and bumbleclucks its way around the arena while the AI throws the ball at bumpers, stars, and somehow teleports the ball around the arena at unpredictable intervals. (And at one time, right into my goal. Hooray for cheating!)The power-ups system is nice, except for the part where it's practically useless. I can run faster... Until I get sacked 2 seconds later by a tackle spanning about 10 feet. There also seems to be a complete lack explanation as to what in the apple sauce they do. A purple negative sign? Armor on the ground? A can of... Something with an S on it?This game had a lot of promise - and I'm sure 23 or so years ago the original was fantastic - but this one isn't.			",440,50,17,41,34,3,46

												I'm not quite sure how it's possible to take a game that's almost 15 years old and make it look worse but Vivid Games do. It's higher resolution, sure, but all nuance of the original is lost, sprites look comical, pitches ugly and it's even hard to tell where the goalmouth starts and ends. Instead of starting with a team that looks like a bunch of nerds your starting team are now randomly cybernetically enhanced. All 'New Art' motivation for purchasing star players is lost. All players are now a mish-mash of badly redrawn features from original characters. If you enjoy looking at clunky photo-fit faces with glued-on moustaches and noses that line up with mouths perhaps one in ten times (once you see this you can't unsee it), you're in for a real treat.Graphics aside, the game is still fairly solid. The on-pitch gameplay is basically just a port of the original with no attempts made to revamp. Game mode differs in a few respects, some good, some bad, but nothing is going to make up for the god awful look of the thing.If there was an option to use original graphics I'd probably be able to recommend this. As-is it's really just a curio for fervent fans of the original. Something to pass the time, to agonise over how what could have been and to highlight just how incredible the original really was.

The matches are pretty quick, so you can fire up the game and play a match if you have 10 mins to kill.EDITSo i just won my first cup and started a new season. The opponent is wiping the floor with me, all my players are way underleveled and are going up against opponents with almost full power and tackle, so i can barely hold on to the ball 2 secs before being clobbered.

												Speedball 2 HD...Hmm, where to start? Lets go back to yonder days when I was much much younger than I am now, the mid 90s (Speedball came out in 1988 and 1990 (2) but was re-released for 95/98 in a multipack) and I remember spending many an hour running around with my cyberpunk steroidal war bears beating up the enemy for ball possession and winning the majority of my games purely by knocking out enemy team members (which gives you as many points as scoring a goal might I add) and screaming at my goal keeper to stop being a poof. Ahhh, good times.Fast forward to today and Speedball 2 HD is a re-release of the 1988 cult classic set in the future of a bloodbowl sport which is a combination of lacrosse, american football and cage fighting. It's exactly like the original (as far as I can remember) and I have already spent a few hours knocking out the enemy and scoring obscene goals. It's such a good remake it has all of it's warts and boils with the buggy player swapping whenever the ball is perfectly between three of your players causing it to bounce all over the place. But all that is forgotten when you get your players hip dancing and kneesliding from scoring or knocking out the enemy players.Brutality aside, this is classic game that is challenging, requires a little thought on how you move around and a lot of keyboards from smashing the spacebar. The challenging enemy players can range from ""screwdrivers in their heads"" stupid to ""holy hell I haven't even touched the ball and it's already half time"". Great to pick up for a quick laugh then put back down. I can imagine friendships being broken when this game is played on the LAN!			",126,11,3,11,6,0,25

												Surprisingly, not bad. Plays smoothly and has all the charm of the original. The additional leagues and seasons add a nice touch and the management aspect of the game is still quite enjoyable without being over complicated.My major complaint would be too much importance placed on the injuring of opposition to score. It always fristrated me when I lost one of my best players in the original and on top of that the opposition gets their goal score from it. Always seemed too major a penalty and this version has taken it up another notch. Disappointing but I'm finding I'm injuring my opposition much more than they're injuring me anyway.The inclusion of online multiplayer would have made me a very happy fan but can't have everything I guess. Bitmap Brothers please take note though, based on the reviews and the feedback people obviously want it. Please deliver!			",48,5,3,11,4,1,7

Back in the day these guys were pioneers and other great games included Xenon 2, Chaos Engine, Z and Cadaver. This version stays loyal to the original but adds a few more features but nothing that takes away any nostalgia you might have.

Actually, it's so buggy that during the tournament matches I faced my very own team. How is that even possible? So, I was playing my team against my team played by the CPU. Obvisouly at the end, my team won and at the same time my team lost. And the game crashed because this situation didn't make any sense.I would have prefered the original game rather than this so called broken remake.Don't let the nostalgia trick you to this trap.

												Complete waste of money, can't play because I can't change the screen resolution, have tried doing it through the game properties and still no joy. To have something as simple as this not working in a game is a joke.  Should of checked reviews before buying, was an impulse buy and thought it would be a good blast from the past. The old version was awesome and it worked, this does not.			",24,1,5,6,2,0,11

												Do not buy this game unless you're a Speedball II groupie.The AI is hardly present. Your controlled players swap randomly. Even the the Sega Genesis Version I own has less flaws.Really really bad UI at the Gym (where you upgrade your player's armor).Actually this is a total downgrade from the original version. If you are interested in this game either try buying it from ebay or use an emulator to play it. You will have more fun.			",153,57,1,33,27,2,15

												I really tried to like this game.  I'll admit it was fun, and even, almost, satisfying at times.  But the poor controls and finicky gameplay mechanics made it really hard to play.  It just felt like bs everytime the ball wasn't thrown in the right direction or even not at all.  If you can get past that, there is some fun to be had as the season structure is addicting to play, albeit short.  But it wasn't enough to keep me from giving up on the game.			",242,40,9,28,13,1,20

												When the AI decides that your 2-star team has to face a fully trained 5-star team, you know there is something wrong. The progression is absurd, and the same goes for the gym system. Even if you dump thousands in your players, the overall performance is still pathetic. You're basically facing an arms race, losing dozens of games by a 200-point difference just to get a few dollars and buy players that can actually handle a tackle or two. I have not enjoyed this.

												Some people say that video games cause violent behaviour. Well Speedball 2 did with me as I wanted to punch my monitor right in its flat wide-screen face as it trampled over my memories of a great game.All the fun of the original seems to have been lost and replaced with a ton of frustration. The controls and ball physics are terrible and the one thing they could have updated from the original: online play, they haven't.If you remember the original, avoid it. If you don't, avoid it.

Ai is okay, there aren't any issues aside from the randomness of the game, one strategy i use consistently fails and then i try something by accident and i score.  IMO its a fun game but i feel like theres not a lotta skill in it and it seems to be random.  I'll update when i get more hours into it tho			",88,21,1,24,11,0,14

												Disappointed,  if you like the original then go play that version.  This version has lots of bugs, controls don't respond until you realise that your controlling a different non-highlighted player.  Throwing the ball is hit or miss (usually miss) and doesn't seem to do what you want.  User interface for player management is 'Fancy' but lacks depth and ease of use of the original.  Overall not worth the £1 I paid for it.  Shame on the Bitmap Brothers for letting this be released.			",247,76,10,45,31,1,41

												Ehhh, I just don't know about this game, it's frustrating to play.The tutorial system wasn't as extensive or as explanatory as it should have been, pretty much just hit the basics like movement and passing and such. I jumped into Career mode first and didn't really have any idea what I was doing. The ball and the players were flying all over the place.What really broke this game for me in the first 10 minutes was the way your players were switched. It's disorienting when you have no idea which player you're controlling on the team and where he is when you switch. In theory, the game switches to the player who is closest to the ball when you don't have it. Problem is, it does it so suddenly that it gets confusing. A lot of the times it threw me on the goalie when I thought I was on defense and all of a sudden my goal was unattended. The game can be a real pain in the butt to play when you don't have control over the proper things. I just can't play it.			",169,42,2,38,15,2,46

Speedball 2 HD is a sports game with simple controls, and yet enough complexity of gameplay that it could be decent.  Maybe the original actually was a decent game; I wouldn't know since I've never played it.  This one, though, has issues.  For one thing, each Speedball player has several stats that can be raised to improve their performance, but only two of them are actually explained in the tutorial, and the in-game info sheets shed no further light.  Some stats seem self-explanatory, but others are decidedly not, making this an annoying oversight.  More problematic is the fact that you directly control one of the Speedball players on your team, but the game automatically determines which player you control, and switches you around so frequently that it can seem impossible to keep track of what's happening and where you are, and react quickly enough (sometimes control even switches to a player who's off-screen).  That single gameplay flaw is enough to make this game too frustrating to be worth playing.			",342,170,8,99,29,5,60

												Hell no!First of all it's a very cheap game (down to -90% on sales). Second of all, it looks very nice and is overall polished, stable and well presented. It's kinda nice and might even hold you for a while with it's action, fast loading times and menus and some wit and humour here and there, but rest assured that whatever this game does halfway well, Mutant League Football did miles better back in the old console days.Why so bad? Because you control your team in a way where you move one player and the AI ""controls"" the others before changing the player under your control and moving the player you used to control somewhere less usefull. The AI for the opponent's team does a decent job, much much better than yours so i really don't understand why my defenders are sulking in the corners, midfielders trying to tell their♥♥♥♥♥from their elbow from lying face down while the attackers are usually urinating in the opposition's corners of the field. Occasionally one of them is thrown under my command but given their position and relative uselessnes in pretty much any situation, i think it would be better if i stopped playing and gave full control to the AI.The three attacking players can sorta tackle/pass the ball while rushing forward after the initial face off, but after a few seconds  good luck telling what's going on. It doesn't even matter if you're winning by a 100 spread or losing, your control over your team is equally puzzleing.AI teams are coompetent enough, they try to tackle, score goals or hit bouncers or whatever else to score points. They look coordinated. You can beat weaker opponents by tackling the crap out of their players and occasionally outsmarting the goalie in the rare cases you go 1-1 on him, but if you ever score off a passing play it will be a fluke. Most matches are a cluster♥♥♥♥ of mashing the single control button (yes, one button passes, shoots, tackles) and having no idea if your attacker will pass or try to strike the ball into the goal.Sometimes the ball teleports randomly to a player on the opposing team if you or the opponent fumble the ball and it rolls to a lonely stop all alone and unloved and unkicked for too long. Your idiots will NEVER be in a position to take advantage while the opponent AI will usually score a goal within seconds.And why the hell do i have to control the goalie?! If i'm trying to chase down a runaway opponent the last thing i want is for the control to be switched to the goalie! Because i'm human and it takes me a moment to realise that control has changed and during that time i'll end up telling the wrong player to move. For example the goalie will dive left and leave the goal unprotected when what i wanted was for a defending player to dive left and tackle!Why are you even reading a review for this game? Why does it even exist?? The 90s ""classic"" was better than this, yes it actually was better despite the bar being much much lower back then and expectations and standards being lower as well. Speedball 2 HD couldn't even beat an average game from the 90s, that's how uninspired, uninteresting and completely♥♥♥♥♥♥it is.Play Mutant League Football, or one of the Sensible Soccer series or Kickoff. All those games only let you control one player on the team with AI controlling the rest and switching occuring at sometimes awkward times. But they were fun and controls worked perfectly (they haven't aged well though). Beat your head into goo with an Atari ST 520 or a frozen cheeze, just don't go near Speedball 2 HD.Developers didn't care enough to keep Manager mode where you at least don't have to play, and they couldn't be bothered to code online multiplayer where two friends could at least laugh and cry together as they fail to control their teams.There is nothing to redeem this game. If you were to throw your own poo at the devs windows, it would be a waste of poo.			",70,24,8,13,26,0,19

												I was a huge fan of the classic Amiga original, so when i first heard about this i was immediately enthralled. A couple of days later a friend of mine had bought it and told me that it had some niggles that meant it wasn't as good as the Amiga version, but still a good game. Since it's only £5.50 (i'd payed £25 for the Amiga original in 1991!) i figured what the hell, i'll give it a go.I have to say he was right, it does have some niggles that mean it's not as good as the original Amiga version, but it is still a good game and very enjoyable. Fans of the original will be pleased to hear it plays near identically, with the transfer market, gym and the all important match play itself all faithfully reproduced. Graphically i don't think it compares to the Amiga version though and while many of the sounds have been ported over from the original, some additional sound in the form of in-game music feels out of place. Thankfully said music can be turned off.In the match play, the ball feels rather heavy and slow, so doesn't travel very far when thrown. But where the match play compares particularly unfavourably to the Amiga original is with injuries. In the original these were somewhat rare, as even the weakest players were still somewhat strong, but here you will find injuries to opposing players are rather easy to dish out and you'll average at least 3 per game. If you get more, they can't bring on a substitute and so with one or more players short they become a bit too easy to beat. That's not to say the computer teams are a walkover, they certainly aren't, and once they have a sniff of a goal they've as good as scored. So the computer is at least competative, which is a good thing since multiplayer consists of LAN play only, there is no online multiplayer at all. Hopefully this will be addressed in the future as this game is just crying out for that feature.My final niggle is the resolution, with 1920x1200 being the maximum supported, so if you playing at a resolution higher than that (as i am) you'll have to make do. With 1920x1080 and 1920x1200 now being pretty much mainstream resolutions for gamers, this game really should support at least up to 2560x1600.However, those are the only issues i've encountered with this game. Everything else is very good and make the game extremely enjoyable, particularly for those of us who played and loved the classic Amiga game. Highly recommended.			",211,16,19,31,27,0,62

												I recommend this game with mixed feelings. If you have never played the Sega Genesis version, then you will love this game, but for those that loved the genesis version, you will most likely not care for this game.Overall, Speedball 2 HD is fun. It's a mix between rugby and handball, with a science fiction futuristic twist. There are powerups, warp tunnels, and action items, along with hard hitting, good passing, and goal scoring. The objective of this game is to outscore you opponent. You can score by knocking out a player, hitting stars on the sideboard, hitting 1 of 2 circle orbs in the center of the arena, or get it in the opponent's goal. Each scoring method has its own point value, and the strategy is to score points as quickly and often as possible. The game is action packed, and very fun.My main gripe is the differences between the classic Sega version, and this one. While the Steam version has better graphics, more features, better stats, and achievements, the Sega version just dominated it in gameplay. Sega's version was really fast (most likely due to Sega's blast processing ability lol)! The camera view was more zoomed in, so it appeared to move quickly. Throws were longer, there was less hitting and more agility needed, players didn't always fall down in one hit, and there were more stressful and exciting situations that made you grab your controller tightly. Most games were usually close, with scores only 10-20 points different from each other. In the Steam version, I can easily beat the computer by over 100 points in a game. I usually score 40-70 points in 45 seconds, and once that happens, I know they aren't going to come back.Personally, I feel that the original price is much too high for this game, but if you can grab it on sale, it's fun for anyone, Speedball fan or not.

												IA is braindead, so don't buy this to play solo. But if you have friends as nostalgic as you, it's a good game in multiplayer. Basic, but fun for the occasional match. Also, how long has it been since the last futuristic violent sports game ? Is there even any around ?			",191,81,0,35,18,0,35

												You see all those negative reviews? Those are from people who grew up with Speedball 2 and hate this HD remake. I never played the original. So you could say I'm not bias and I'm not looking at this HD with rose tinted nostalgia glasses.This game is good. It's fun once you get the hang of it. The sprites look kinda bad but it doesn't take away from the game in any way. If you used to play this game as a kid than maybe it will, but if you haven't than it doesn't change anything. I haven't noticed any frame rate issues or weird resolution issues either. The game runs fine. Again if you've never played the original don't be afraid of this HD remake, it's perfectly fine it's just people complaining due to nostalgia...			",172,22,2,30,28,2,39

												I was expecting this to be the 2007 Xbox version of the game, but no, this is a new version that sticks closer to the original. As a fan of the Amiga game, I was a little put off by the cartoony new look at first — it would be nice if there were an option to use the original graphics. But, thankfully, it still plays like Speedball 2, and you'll see why this is still such a classic game. I enjoyed the new ability to change up offensive/defensive formations on the fly (but I'm not sure about some of the new power-ups). Ice cream! Ice cream!			",182,59,5,26,16,4,49

												never play the original games, so i cant compare them, and i got this game for free tho.first time i open the game, i was surprised there is no turtorial or training section, this is not an ordinary sports like soccer or football that anyone knows the basic.so i select the quick match and decide to see how it plays.the controls are simple, you only need one button and 4 direction button when playing a match.press action button for short pass and hold action button for lob pass, anyway the shoot button and pass button are same, so its pretty hard to score at the first time, but then you will realize that you can kick the goalkeeper♥♥♥♥♥ so you can score easily. and the pass are pretty hard when you first time playing it.the ai are too easy, you can score easily.there are some way to make some score. first, shoot the ball to the goal, just like soccer. second, bounce the ball to the ""pinball like"" thing and stars. the last one, you just need to knockout your enemy, it gives you plenty of score.the graphic are okay, but the animation is funny (in a bad way)the music and sound are good, nothing bad in here. oh and that ""ice cream"" sound is funny (in a good way, of course)the major problem in this game are there is no online multiplayer, i think online multiplayer would be great in this game.afterall, this game is great, its worth to playbut it is worth $9.99? nope, if they add some online multiplayer mode, buy it at a full price, if they dont, just grab some free copy like me or wait for discount(sorry for my bad english)			",373,69,16,33,40,4,42

												What the heck is Speedball? No, it’s not a special drug that the kids are doing but it probably has the same effect on your adrenal system. Speedball is a sport designed for cyborgs, played in a not so distant future. Combine football, rugby, and MMA and you have a pretty decent idea of what this brutal sport entails. Matches are quick, taking only a couple minutes, so it isn’t just a clever name. Destroying the other team’s players is just as important as scoring goals and as barbaric as it sounds, Speedball is a surprisingly deep game.I have always been a sucker for ‘alternative’ sports. Give me Mutant League Hockey over NHL,  Frozen Endzone instead of Madden, and Base Wars before MLB. If I’m going to play a vanilla sport I’m going to do it in real life, reserving futuristic robot sports for the video game medium. Speedball 2 HD is a remake of the Bitmap Brothers’ most successful game, Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe. It’s been over 20 years since the last decent Speedball game and this is the most accurate representation of the sport/game you are going to find. Vivid Games has done the series justice and thank god Mastertronic had the balls to publish the damn thing.   Speedball is astonishingly simple thanks to a refined control scheme, and two basic rules: The first is to put the biscuit in the basket and the second is to devastate the other team with sick tackles. This is all made very easy by having only one button for all actions, and I highly suggest you have a controller while playing as this will make things much easier. When you have ball possession, pressing the action button will throw the ball in that direction and holding the action button will lob the ball in the air. Pressing the action button without the ball initiates a tackle and your player will slide in the direction he is facing, mauling any opposing player in the way. I’m going to level with you, this ain’t no graceful ballet and Speedball games can quickly devolve into all out brawls since points are rewarded for injuring players on the other team. Once a player is injured by having all their health depleted, they are carted off by medical bots and replaced by a substitute. It’s not my favorite tactic, but beating the other team down so you have a player advantage is acceptable in Speedball, and a great way to win games. Aside from mashing up the other team and scoring goals, there are a number of variables on the field that can change the game. The permanent structures such as bumpers will not only change the course of the ball, but will award bonus points if a team manages to score after the bumper is hit. Bumpers can be used for both offensive and defensive purposes, conjuring up some interesting plays. If you thought it was fun dunking in NBA Street after launching the ball off the backboard...Speedball 2 HD makes that look like child’s play. Ramps on the sides of the field will accelerate the ball and give a 50 percent bonus to points scored on that run, however this is cancelled when the opponent puts it through the ramp. This makes controlling the sidelines paramount to success as it can effectively half the amount of points you need to score during a game. This is especially important when you’re up against a stronger, faster, better team and you don’t have Michael Jordan or Bill Murray on your roster. Other structures on the field include stars on the side that can be used for extra points, as well as portals that will teleport the ball to the other side of the field. Take note playmaking wizards. Finally, random powerups will be littered across the throughout the game that can temporarily boost a player, or harm the opposing team. There are several modes in Speedball 2 HD including quick play, tournament, and a career mode. Career mode puts you in the role of a GM of a team, which you can name and choose a logo, but that is about it when it comes to customization. As you win games, you get cash that can be used to train your players and increase their stats. I found after a couple seasons my winnings had allowed my team to surpass everyone in the galaxy stat-wise so games became terribly easy and I was blowing out teams by 100 points every game. That being said, the AI isn’t great and Speedball 2 HD is best played on a couch with a friend. Multiplayer is unfortunately limited to local only so you are going to have to convince people to come to your house.    Speedball 2 HD is a great remake, and as I mentioned previously the best version of the game you are going to find. It’s not bustling with features but it has some depth to it. The career mode will keep you busy enough to get your money’s worth and a decent sense of progression across multiple seasons. No online multiplayer is a shame, but if you can manage to get a group of friends over for a small tournament it will be a great game to have. It’s fast, and easy to learn and a hard hitting little gem that satiate your need for a Murderball game.			",817,217,9,103,64,10,112

												I never even played the original game, yet still get a huge wave of nostalgia when playing this - I think since the sounds and gameplay remind me of Ice Hockey on the NES - but on steroids. So fun and addicting for me...the second I opened it up I couldn't exit until I beat the first cup or whatever its called...heh. However, I got this through Humble Bundle - don't think I would pay 10 bucks for it, but honestly haven't explored the rest of the game options beyond Career mode so far. If 10 bucks isn't much to you, then I recomend picking it up if you're in to these type of games :D  If 10 is pushing it for you, I'd wait for it to go on sale (or grab it from Humble Bundle now!)Enjoy!

												An old faithful Amiga player returning to look at Speedball 2. It's the same game, and at the same time it really isn't the same game!For any Amiga purists out there, you'll notice that causing injuries to other players is a lot easier on this ""HD"" version, and the ball isn't quite as quick or fluid in the way that it moves around the screen. To me at least it feels like passing became slow and easy - and the ball certainly doesn't travel as far. Gone are the days where you charged the opposing CF and threw it to your winger with plenty of style and grace.The faces of old memorable characters are still there, but a real shame they haven't kept their old names - greats such as the old Jams, Norman, Montez, Cooper... all present, but with stupid names. I'd love to have seen them keep those, or at least make player names editable.If you can overlook what some would say are trivial aesthetics, the game is enjoyable, with added features such as scouting your opponents stats  before playing them and suchlike.At the Steam sale price of under £2 its an excellent bargain.Now, if only I can find Bloodwych, Supercars 2 and Sensible Soccer on here... ;)			",15,7,0,4,4,1,5
