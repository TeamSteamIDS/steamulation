												Actually a good workout and a fun basketball game akin to the arcade hoops games.  Dev should add some kind of money/gold system for when you hit X points to unlock stuff.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As far as gameplay goes, it's just a pretty on rail ball thrower and well I like throwing balls as much as the next guy, especially at a girl who keeps getting in the way of said balls. Is it worth $20, no not really, probably a good one to get on sale.Also for those wondering, if you're fine with a low score, it can indeed be played with one hand.			",244,74,2,27,33,5,7
