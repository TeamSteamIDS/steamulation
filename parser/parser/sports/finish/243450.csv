8/10""The cool little brother of Trials Evolution - without Uplay!!!""Great arcade-beating-your friends-highscore title.Although this is an offshoot, Urban Trial Freestyle feels very good even if it's not as perfect as Trials Evolution. But it offers some new features&improvements I really enjoyed. No uplay, no friend score lags, 4 new ingame records (e.g.highest & longest jump), better ingame ghost bikes & the ""background"" action of the stages.Pros:+ no uplay!!!+ great stages (a lot is going on in the background)+ good controls+ good gameplay+ nice graphics+ okay ost&sounds+ addictive & challenging+ new ingame records feature (example)+ ghost bikes of friends+ leaderboards+ no highscore lags + full X360 controller support=> highly recommended!!!Cons:- it feels a bit different than TE, but what the heck!- not as much stages as in TE- no tricks (grabs) you actually do by yourself- no multiplayerDefinitely worth the 0.99 on summer sale!!!

												Urban Trial Freestyle feels like a cheaper version of Trials. It's alright though. And it controls pretty much the same as the Trials games. Unfortunately, the graphics are so-so but there's much more going on in the levels animation-wise. At times it's a bit distracting and sometimes it can be hard to see what you have to do or where you have to go, but it at least made the world feel alive, even if it's an arcade racer.The races/levels can be hard, and earning stars halfway through the game can be frustrating, especially if you want to unlock the next batch of levels. The levels are generally pretty short, however, so I can't see anyone ragequiting over them. But it's a time consuming task.Like Trials, you can also change your character's clothing and upgrade his motorcycle. You can do this with money. Money is scattered across the levels and collecting it will allow you to do this. Some of it is hidden in plain sight, other bags are located in less obvious places. Finishing a level doesn't always result in you getting money so that was what I meant when I was talking about the frustration part earlier. Upgrading your motorcycle can help you improve your score(s).In the end UFT is a good game, but just not good enough. Pay a few [currency] more and buy Trials instead. And buy this in a sale later on.[Rating: 76/100]			",1658,633,69,221,194,16,225

												Ok lets get this out of the way first yes this game is a clone of ""TRIALS EVOLUTION"" but is that a bad thing-i think not.The game plays very smoothly and the graphics and sound are both well suited to this type of game,i actually think i like this more than ""TRIALS"" (played on X BOX not on pc-so not sure how it plays on the pc to be honest).The bike handles well and only becomes more tricky to handle when you upgrade it but this is a part of the game as some later levels get quite tricky to do unless the bike actually is upgraded.As the game progresses you earn money (found in levels and sometimes it is quite trickey to get) which you use to upgrade the bike and also you can buy new gear such as gloves,helmet,trousers ect.All these things though are cosmetic and offer no in game incentive (no increase to anything such as speed,handling ect) other than to make your character look more like you want them to.If i was to play one game or the other i think i would choose this over ""TRIALS"" as it just seems to be that little bit more user friendly and therefor a more forgiving experience,which leads to a better gaming experience all round.

												Well this game surprised me, a hell of a lot!What looks like a dodgey Trials HD rip off from the store page, turns out to be a fairly decent competitor.The game features full controller support, friend-list and worldwide leaderboards, player ghosts to race against, achievements, minigames, steam cloud and trading cards.PROSExtremely well optimisedGraphics better/on par with TrialsAdds new gameplay elements that pit you against your friends mid levelControls great, 360 pad controls being the same as TrialsUses friends avatars and scores in unique and competitive yet fun waysA fair amount of contentGenerously pricedSmall download sizeNo uPlay DRMCONSSlight repeat of levels from time to timeNot many video optionsNot the tightest bike control when compared to Trials franchiseUses annoying mobile-like star system to progress in campaignLimited player and bike customisationsNo multiplayerNot many levels seem to rely on speed, something that makes Trials exciting=-=-=Overall I had to think much harder for the list of cons than I did the pros and even at double the cost it's worth every penny. Trials on Steam comes with horrible uPlay DRM and aren't the most optimised of games. So for the budget PC gamer who loves him/her some trials biking, this is 100% the game for you.Play the game so I can race against you in my Urban Trial Freestyle friendslist.

												This is a really good little game, especially if you can get it in a sale, then money well spent.Also everyone who reads this and i know what you are thinking, is it like trials hd on the x-box 360. well no, no it isnt, the physics are not as sharp as trials but personally i found them better than trials hd to be honest, not to punishing,.My advice would be to by this and trials hd, and use this to practice on and to have fun, because it is a very good fun gameBut yes i would reccomend to a friend, and also the graphics, im using a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650 GDDR5 1GB graphics card with 16GB RAM Intel Core I5-3570K CPU @ 3.40GHz Proccesor On a ASUS P8Z77-V LX MotherBoard, and i can say they ran very smoothly, they look quite very good/cool, plus going up against the leader board is proper addictive at times, the game also works on controllers too which for me was added bonus.Now.The downsides.There is not any really, other than no content yet, but im sure the devs are prbably monitoring this thread for advive on where to go next,Me Personally would offer up a track editer of some kind so you can come up with some tracks of your own, this alone can add an endless play factor to it, and also add some challenges in the form of updates and also paid for DLC, extra fun challenges tracks time trials you could put anything in it,  make some packs paid for and also make some free as thanks for being loyal customers...Me and our lass have had a blast on it, so, if you have got to the end of this review, then what are you doing still here.Go Buy It As You Wont Be Dissaponted....My Score & Rank Is : 4.½ Out Of 5.0Top Notch Freakin GameProper Fun TimesThats my review and what i think personallyCheersmark117hP.S. ###### Yes I Would Recommend This Game To A Friend Defo ######			",69,4,5,7,4,0,1

												Pros:- OK graphics- Good for a quick game when you have little time- Ability to customize bike before each race is coolCons:- Extremely short- Nothing to do besides the main stages and the challenges, which give you nothing in return- Bike customization is very limited- Cheaters topping the leaderboards for every track, devs seem to not care about it- Bike sounds are repetitive and out of place, it never feels like a true engineOverall 4.5/10Grab it if it's in the Humble Bundle, otherwise don't pour 10€ into it, wait for a sale.

												Remember when Trails came out?  It was super hard, yet entertaining in their use of physics with tight controls and well thought out maps and levels that were hard, but managable once you mastered the controls! Urban Trail Freestyle is just like that, if it was the same game with ugly textures, floaty controls, damn near impossible obsticles and your roommate kicking you in the beans periodically through game play. For $.99, I got 45 minutes to an hour of playtime out of it.  It's not unplayable yet it's not really enjoyable either.  They tried to spice it up with a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥trick system that you have absolutely no control over.   The controls are sloppy at best and will lead to much swearing and teeth gnashing.   I would have played through it, except for a near impossible obsticle half way through world 4 (I think) and after 15 minutes of retrying that, it dawned on me I'd have more fun going to chew tinfoilBut hey, at least it's got cards!

The game presents a ( very ) large range of places to have fun, such as huge dams, montange russes, subways, alleys of a city, highways and so much more!I've got this game during the Summer Sale for only $1, and it was so worth it!

100% worth the pricetagA modern-day version of the NES classic Excitebike. This type of games have been very popular on Flash game sites since forever.Really nice graphics for this type of game, the developers have done a marvelous job.It is essentially a 2D game in a 3D world. You see your motocross bike from the side, basic controls to accelerate, decelerate and control your pitch (lean forwards/back).The goal is to drive through the course as quickly as possible while avoiding obstacles and performing certain tasks. Each level have a set of objectives where you get tested such as; ""Precise Aim"" where you need to jump as close at a target as possible, ""Highest Jump"" where you jump as high as possible, etc.Your records are uploaded and you can compare to other players online.On the levels there's moneybags, if you collect these you can buy new parts for your motocross bike and costumes for your character.There are 5 different ""worlds"" with ~8 levels on each, some levels seem to be reused or atleast portions of them are, but this is fine, they offer different challenges in the objectives instead.Once you've started making your way through the main levels, a series of challenges start to unlock which are wildly different from the main game. I strongly encourage you to try the challenge levels!I think it could be a fun element if they added tricks to it, for bonus points. There are a few places where you need to do flips to get bonus points, however I would imagine something more freely. Perhaps that goes into a different genre of motocross games tho.I can't really tell if the music is good or not, it's just ambiance. Full-focus on driving and trying to hit the jumps!

Graphics are very nice for a game where you drive only in 1 direction, that's what makes it beautiful I guess, so much better than pixelish 2D jumpers.

												A poor man's trials fusion. A decent indie attempt at that type of game but nowhere near as good as the triple a version. The motorcycle never feels ""fast"" and the sound is more annoying than authentic. Graphics aren't impressive but there are some pretty cool environments. That being said it is sometimes hard to distinguish what is in the foreground and what is in the background. Also some of the jumps and stunts that the game makes you aren't that good and feel awkward. For some reason this game's levels are gated with a mobile game like star unlock system where you must do well on the previous levels to move on. This meant that I couldn't progress after failing to beat one particular level with some pretty bad design. There is only 1 bike with upgrades and some player skins with no actual impact on gameplay. That being said, I did have fun. For its current asking price of 10 USD I would say that this game is worth it if you are very interested in 2d platforming racing games but only just. I would rather wait for a heavy discount if you are anyone else.			",638,168,18,57,56,10,122

												Yes Evo and this are similar, but UTF is different enough to make it worth while getting (if on sale like I did for $4). UTF  is very arcade like; levels are either timed race to the line or high scores by complete tricks (flips, highest jumps, longest jumps). None of the levels are hard unlike Evo which gets pretty full on in some levels. There are limited power ups but choice of bike powerup does make a difference in the levels. The bike doesn't handle the same as Evo at all (which I spent many hours playing on xbox) but Evo is all about the level design and bike control. This game is about having fun so bike control not as important so I didn't mind - it still feels ok and isn't as bad as some people make out. The graphics actually make it entertaining with explosions and stuff falling all over the place. The challenges are quite a laugh although not many of them. Overall, I liked it. Finished run through after 4 hours (non-completionist about 75%). So for $1 an hour I got my moneys worth so I'm happy.			",405,105,23,38,33,6,50

												I was torn whether or not to recommend this game. In the end the constant/random crashing put me over the edge. Urban Trial Freestyle isn't too bad of a game. The core things are there. The physics, upgrading your bike and the tracks are all good. I'm running Windows 8.1 64-bit and the games stability was marginal at best. Sometimes it would crash once and then play fine for an indefinite amount of time. Other times it would crash at random over and over again and I just had to give up that day. Not fun.It also crashed every single time I got a Steam card for the game while playing. I feel like the graphics engine wasn't optimized very well as I had to lower shadow settings and turn off AA. I have a GeForce GTX295. For the level of graphics in this game... it shouldn't be struggling at the max settings. I was able to get a constant 60FPS by lowering the shadow detail and turning off AA but i had to run it in 1920x1080. Speaking of resolution. I have two 1440p monitors and i seemed to get slightly better stability when i set my resolution to match what I’d launch the game at. It took me 10 hours to beat all the tracks, get all the cash bags and beat all the challenges. Pros-Nice looking graphics-Good physics-Entertaining levelsCons-Poorly optimized-Random/Constant crashes-Listening to the same, UNSKIPPABLE intro every time you start the gameIf you get this on sale for a dollar or two, it'll give you a bit of entertainment for your money. Anything higher than that I can't recommend due to stability/performance issues.3/10 Poor			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just like all the other angle and physics racing games. This one is a bit easier than others due to track layout, and you can take a beating without falling off the bike. Fun for a little bit then gets old fast. Not as fun as the other types of similar games.			",239,36,8,32,14,2,32

												Why do I want to aimlessly drive a motorcycle through the streets crashing dramatically? Because who doesn't love smashing and jumping around for points. Something about this game is exceedingly entertaining. It's very pick-up-and-play and allows for great replayability. There are similarly titled games by Ubisoft on Steam too that are just awful. The controls for those games are clunky. If you were disapointed by Ubisoft give this one a try. They got it right.			",2088,801,68,235,219,26,317

												Trials Evolution exists, Trials Fusion exists, ♥♥♥♥ this game.Yup, the Trials games (the real ones) are made by Evilsoft, but they are at least good games, this however is a mess that has you replaying (I'm taking a not so wild guess here after having played just over half of the game) 5-6 levels over and over again.Atrocious checkpoints on each one of those levels, and when you're racing a cpu ghost, which makes almost no mistakes, those checkpoints tend to♥♥♥♥♥♥you the eff off when they send you back 30 seconds.If you have this game already, let it chill in your library looking all pretty and adding that +1 to your overall game count, because that's the only thing it's good for, or torture yourself like I am, and get some playfire money if you're reading this brilliant review within a week of me writing it.Let me paint you a clear picture, if there were such a thing as an insult chart, ""go play Urban Trial Freestyle"" would be rated just above ""eat s#!t and die"".

												This is gonna be the obligatory comparison to Trials Evolution!Urban Trial Freestyle wins in dynamic maps with some cool slow-mo effects, smooth gameplay and surprisingly pretty sharp graphics, it also uses steamworks features.Cons: Had to use xpadder to map controls in my gamepad, it apparently only works without hiccups with the official 360 controller.  Content is low, doesnt take long to finish everything.Now when it comes to Trials Evolution it wins with much much more content, multiplayer servers and better physics. If Trials Evolution would use dynamic maps and steamwork features then it would be the obvious choice. But it doesnt!Overall UTF is a good game, i'll go as far to say that it was worth the preorder price ($12). But dont think it's worth more than that.			",237,11,34,19,11,1,25

Despite the doubt, I decided to try it out and I found myself INSTANTLY hooked! After that, the competative nature in me told me that i had to complete every map, then find all the money, THEN get 5 starts on all maps, THEN complete the challenges, and boy did I enjoy EVERY second, besides the frustration on the odd occasion.

												this is a really fun game if you're into the whole trials thing. it looks good and there's a lot going on on the levels as you're making your escape from the law. things go boom, break, catapult you into the air, etc. it might not have as much content as its bigger brothers (40 levels, 2 tutorials and 5 challenges altogether, and of those 40 about 25 are unique, the rest are the same with different conditions), but I found most of it really enjoyable, except the 'watch your head' type of obstacles and the really steep ones, those got on my nerves sometimes.initially I thought it'd be impossible (for me, at least) to unlock every level, as you need to get about 75% of the stars (that means 4-starring almost everything), but if I could do it, anybody can. also, money is short and you have to collect it from the levels, some are really well hidden too, but to be honest, I didn't really fool around with bike configurations, just bought and used what I could afford and I still managed, though I assume if I knew what I was doing it would've been an even better and more successful journey.either way, if you're looking for more trials gameplay, a cheaper alternative, or an introduction to the genre, pick it up, but there's also a demo to try if you're uncertain.

												This is pretty much the worst racing game I've ever played.  Most of the negative reviews I read focused on the game being a Trials clone, which wouldn't offend me in the least.  In fact, I found it to be more reminiscent of Trackmania.  The real issue is that the bike physics are garbage, the courses aren't well designed, doing well doesn't feel rewarding, and the player's character is a dope.  I'd also ding it for having your character start off naked instead of having at least basic protective gear - having to win races before you can wear a helmet is nonsensical, like so much else in this game.

												I bought this game during the summer sale at $0.99, totally worth the deal. I've spend a total of 19.2hrs on this game to complete the game to 100%, all achievements done. Overall, a fun bike/platformer game and if one is willing to go for 100% achievement, repetition is definitely there and its a total test of patience if one is to get the perfect trial run in every stages.P/S: Tips/Tricks for most of the stages can be found on YouTube; it'll be labelled for PS3. However, tricks for steam version are the same as the PS3 version as I've followed those tricks to get to 100% completion. Vita version might differ in this case.			",57,11,3,7,5,0,5

												Urban Trials Freestyle – When this game first came out there where a lot of bad reviews even from those who haven't played it. The main complaints where that the game 'is a copy of Trials HD' which I think is ridiculous because all games copy of each other some how, this game still brought in the timed level and skill level which are great to try and get up the leaderboard and it has it's own maps, they aren't copied so you can just think of it as a map pack instead of raging about a game you haven't played. I have a major issue though, It's too easy, I’ve never completed a game on the first day I’ve had it since guitar hero. I got all the achievements and so there was nothing left for me to do but it is a good game and I do suggest that you try it out. The controls are easy to get used to (This includes Xbox controller and mouse/keyboard). It is a short game overall and it won't take you long to work your way through them but it would be better if they made an expansion pack or they make a new game that is a hell of a lot longer. It would make it better if they copied a map creator that is another thing that people brought up because once you complete the game then you have nothing to do, It has done nothing for me, I had fun at the time but now what? I still suggest you try this game, it still is good in my opinion but it could definitely be improved.			",89,9,13,1,10,0,10

												Urban Trial Freestyle is a fun little game, but compared to Trials Evolution - which it is obvious that Freestyle tried to mimic - it simply does not hold a candle. Here you have no multiplayer mode or custom track creator, the amount of tracks is disappointing, the customization system feels borderline meaningless and the gameplay feels too simple and casual. It’s not a terrible game, but it adds nothing new to the table to weigh up for its lackluster features. With better alternatives around that do everything better, Urban Trial Freestyle ends up being a pointless purchase at its current price.2.5/5Read more:http://pixeljudge.com/en/reviews/urban-trial-freestyle/ ",329,55,5,29,30,2,35

												Personal YES for this game. I did really enjoy it.Okay, so where to start? Basically, I'm not quite a fan of any extreme sports games, well I am, but I don't play them too much. My last game was Gravity Defied I guess .-.So, this game pretty much delivers. I didn't expect it to be any good, but that game just dropped my expectations to tha ground.First of all, graphics is pretty decent. I did enjoy all these dystopian pictures that the developers showed in the game, classically, about the police, fire everywhere and some kind of nuclear war o3o, especially in the last partThe gameplay itself is pretty nicely done, physics is decent, and it's quite easy to play, since you need only 4 keys and within an hour you're gonna be pro at this game, of course of you aren't a lobster.Challenge in this game is pretty fun, getting points, and stuff. The easiest way to win is for sure time challenge, that I've won several times there lel. It's not too much of popular games these days so you do have a chance to get on top of board even not being pro at extreme sports games.The Challenge Mode isn't really too interesting...worth playing once or twice though.But I'll be sure to play story mode again and again to get mroe stars and earn more recordsSo, all in all, this is not yet perfect game, but rather decent, sometimes it's ♥♥♥♥ed up and you just don't understand how to do some sh*t at some points, but it really delivers, so8.8/10Recommended for fans.

I would have loved to write something about the content of the game but I haven't been able to play it.In short: UNPLAYABLE with a keyboard due to technical issues.

												Where do I start with this game? I had purchased it during the Steam summer sale for only 99 cents. In my mind I thought ""Hmmmm how bad could this game actually be for only 99 cents?"" and man, is this game bad. I loved Trials Evolution, that game was a masterpiece, but this game is nowhere near sharing the name Trials.When launching the game and arriving at the title screen you see the hip rebelious biker dude and hear that the police are after him for tresspassing with his bike.(zZzZZZZzZZzZzz)The gameplay of this game is not fun. Repetative levels and annyoing characters that say the same lines over and over during the levels. ""FREEZE POLICE"" says the police officer as you cruise by the 10 different groups of them each level. But the funny thing is if you stop in front of the police, they dont do anything. They just roll around and act like they're going to do something as you are at a standstill.While playing the single player, the goal is to collect the stars from each level and using them to unlock the next level. BUT, you have to play the same level 2 or 3 times playing the different ""modes"" to gain the plentiful amount of stars needed. The handling of the bike is way too easy. This game has no challenge what so ever.I'm surprised that this game is being sold for $10 now (even at $15). If this game were still 99 cents, I would not recommend it to anyone. In the end, this game screams of a iOS or Android game for your cellular device. How did this game make it to consoles and even steam?			",51,5,1,0,1,0,2

												Game rocks! If you like driving games and/or where you get to do tricks on a motorcycle, this is awesome. I haven't played one like this before (and I've really combed through the Steam game library) so not sure how to describe it. It isn't frustrating, it's just tons of fun. Like I've said in my other reviews, I like games where I can zone out at times and just become absorbed. And choose whether or not to just relax - or play hard, being challenged. This is one that does that. You learn new tricks as you go along. New environments. I'm still newish to Steam (one year so far) but I've tried out a lot of driving games and this is one of my top five favorites. I think I paid for it 1/2 price else I wouldn't have bought it. However, if I knew what it was going to be like, I would have agreed it was well worth full price. I think if they had a demo to give people a taste, even more people would buy it.

To add insult to injury, Steam reckons that I've played the game for 19minutes! Huh? How about 'Have tried running game for 19minutes, more like!!!Damn, blast and a whole lot of booooooo's!!!!!!!!!

												This game is a gift wrapped box of chocolate for your Steam collection.  I have no idea why it has a low metacritic, as this game is just plain damn fun!  I would write more, but I need to make sure none of my friends beat my scores.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's not a bad motorbike game, I just wish I could customize the steering keys to WSAD, my right hand is killing me -cough-Oh, and I hate that green ghost who always outraces me. I am a bad driver.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
