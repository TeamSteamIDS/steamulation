												Decent casual game that would be best played on a mobile platform with a touch interface... other than that... if guiding floating vessels on water through treacherous passages and obstacles by manipulating the wind and currents is something you wanted to try out in a game... here it is in 2D low resolution classical style.

												2d puzzle short-break game, where you need to help some folks lead their boats through the very troubling seas. You'll be creating small physical phenomena on the way of those boats, to save them from harm. In a Greek god way, indirectly and somehow messy, but with the good intentions at heart.With the current price and the reality of Steam ""greenlight"" Augean stables going wild with the really bad things selling great just because they have trading cards on the board... I'd say ""The Odyssey: Winds of Athena"", or whatever that game calls itself - is a decent project, which is not trying to rip you off, and providing with just enough gaming experience for the small price.That is correct, of course, only by comparisons with the weakest part of Steam, all those sleaze stuff that have any value only with cards... If we remember, that almost for the same money we can buy high-quality things like WItcher 1 (where even the optional mini-games are more inspiring than that ""Odyssey"")... That so many good games of the equal cultural value, as ""Odyssey"", are freeware from the start... Well, I can't say that I Really Recommend the game. It is working, it has quite rare, almost unique game mechanics, it is fairly provides you with the promised puzzle-like gameplay fitting to fill short pauses in your life, like awaiting in the traffic or in some queue... Yeah, that goes mostly as the thing for mobile platforms, and not full-time PC gaming experience.So I'll mark the Odyssey as 5.7/10. It is not a bad game, it is fair, costs little, has cards to align the price even more. It provides enough gameplay to fill your hands for some time... yet it is not inspiring enough to really go for it.So if you get it discounted or bundled - that's not a waste. Just don't expect much.			",725,237,45,155,101,5,232

-Quick Review-God Game: The Odyssey is... difficult to give a standard genre category... the popular tags are: Action, casual, strategy, indie, simulation. But I would create my own genre called ""Phone app games"" or ""minimalist computer requirements.""God Game: The Odyssey was developed by Liquid Dragon Studios and released in 2015, you play as the Greek Goddess Athena, your goal is to help guide Odysseus's fleet back home by controlling the wind, and water currents.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: God Game: The Odyssey follows the story of Odysseus returning from the Trojan Wars. ('Ya know, the war all the hackers fought and e-mailed each other the Trojan Virus, there were many a computer casualty lost in these wars. Sad tale really. If I could write music I'd write an ""ode to the Trojan Virus Wars"".)

			As the story progresses, you hear more about greek mythology, which introduces a new mechanic/npc that you must learn to combatant to successfully pass through the next set of levels.		


As the story progresses, you hear more about Greek mythology, which introduces a new mechanic/NPC that you must learn to combatant to successfully pass through the next set of levels.Game Play: There are two core controls in guiding the ships through the various puzzles: Controlling the wind, and controlling the currents. When you use wind, the ships will try to sail directly to the end goal. This sometimes works in your favor if there are no obstacles obstructing your path... if there is something in the way, you will need to click and drag to create ""water currents"" to guide your boats. (or watch them ignore your currents and go the wrong way. I've actually seen my whole fleet go the wrong way... I showed them by crashing them into the rocks for their insolence!)As the game progresses you need to face giants, tornado's (or were they waterspouts? Same thing), Harpies, Lotus (yes, the flowers are apparently devilish), and much more. The game is very good at pausing and explaining just why you should avoid _____ because _____.

But I have seen some forum posts requesting achievements. You REALLY don't want achievements for this game, the only people who will try to get them all are maniac-achievers like myself, and please don't make me get perfects on each levels, that's just madness.

This is a sample of what it looks like to complete a level, if you do very well you'll get a ""perfect"" or ""excellent"" star rating for getting enough points.Price God Game: The Odyssey is priced at $4.99, I personally like having my games last an hour for every dollar I spent, however, this game started to grind me down after playing through several puzzles. I think it has a fair amount of content, and a fair amount of replay value... but it's best on a mobile device, rather then on a computer.Conclusion: In conclusion... not a bad game, but not a game I personally won't be spending much time playing it. If Achievements are added, I'll be forced to return to Odyssey ...and wish for death because the game can be agonizingly painful at times. However, there is a sense of pride when you complete a puzzle in Odyssey.I recommend this to people who enjoy ""app-style-games"", as well as anyone looking to support an indie game publisher, and lastly people that play games on mobile devices. (It seems like Odyssey was designed for it.)------Edits and updates------Edit/Update January 14, 2015:So yeah, apparently the spell checker on the text program wasn't either there, or malfunctioned. My apologizes for that, I checked for the most common errors and re-uploaded my review. Feel free to comment corrections if you spot something grammatically incorrect in any of my reviews.

												In this game you play as the goddess Athena, who's job it is to guide Odysseus' boats to safety. You do this by altering the wind strength, which always blows toward their destination, and by dragging your mouse through the sea to create currents.This sounds simple enough, but you also have to prevent the ships from hitting rocks and sand bars, and avoiding other dangers like a cyclops throwing rocks at them (you can catch the rocks by clicking on them with the mouse). Additionally you need to direct the boats to statues to unlock gates and there are also bonuses to pick up along the way. Naturally it gets harder as you progress, with newer dangers and more difficult maps to negotiate.Although the graphics are pleasing, the resolution is only 640x480. You have a choice of full screen or windowed.To be honest, it's not my type of game and it didn't hold my interest for very long, but it's by no means a bad game. It wouldn't appeal to everyone, but it's fairly challenging and I'm sure some gamers would enjoy it.Conclusion: a decent casual game ideal for a quick play when you don't have much time to spare.

												God Game is a casual puzzle game inspired by ""The Odyssey"" (you know that famous old greek myth!). Your goal is  a simple yet getting progressively more difficult one: Get your ships safely to the exit by manipulating wind/air currents. To finish a level you have to have saved a certain number of ships; stretch goals include an expert rating (save more ships) and a perfect rating (save all ships). While it is pretty easy at first to get perfect rating, pretty soon the difficulty steps up by introducing environmental hazards like sand banks, reefs and even enemies e.g. Cyclops, Harpies (the later can even be used to your advantage and you will have to utilize them at times).The game itself is nice to play in between or to relax. My only gripe is the lack of incentive to go back to levels and try harder at getting expert/perfect rating...achievements would definitely do the trick here.			",143,26,2,21,2,1,3

This game is really fun, it's simple and the first couple levels are perfect for getting the hang of the game.Mechanics are solid; boats will sail directly towards the exit (although be careful if there is a reef/sandbar in the way) when you start up the wind, you can use currents to help guide a boat or two at a time - which is useful for some of the levels to open gates/locks.Music is a plus, personally I prefer the in-game music although there is an option to disable it as well if you prefer.To complete a level there are several conditions:The first is a minimum amount of boats you need to get to the exit of the level, usually simple although on higher levels it can be a challenge!The second victory condition is if you get a higher number (depends on the level) of boats than the minimum.While the graphics are not amazing or anything like that they look well done and fit the tone (early greek ages) of the game, I can easily run and play this game on my laptop as well which is always a plus.Over all I definitly recommend this game if you are a fan of puzzle games, four out of five stars!Cheers, SHARKE BYTE			",454,147,16,46,46,1,86

												have you ever woken up in the morning and wished you could control the wind and water currents?well this game is gonna make you wish you couldn't! God game / the odyssey is a .. well i'm not really sure what kind of game it is. You use the mouse to control water currents and a little wheel in the top right to control wind and use these to escort a bunch of boats to the exit. Wind will simply make the boats go in a straight line toward the exit based on the strength whereas the water can be used in more of a directional sense. Water currents are easy to lose control of, so that's a great amount of fun.Enemies in this game are the most frustrating things ever. Cyclopes chuck rocks at your little guys and you have to use the mouse to catch boulders which you can then use to drop on their heads and stun them for a few seconds. There's two problems with that: first, if you have to use the mouse to catch moving boulders, there's a pretty big chance youre gonna screw up, miss, and completely throw your boats all over the place by accidentally using the water current instead. Problem two is even if you use a boulder to stun the cyclopes, he's gonna throw another boulder again in like two seconds. Your other enemy is harpies, which you gotta click to shoe off. See, again the problem is that if you click and miss these freaks, you're just gonna screw up the water current and make it a complete pain to get boats back on course. Clicking is the only control in the game so you have to juggle so many things with one action and half the time when you're trying to do one thing you'll accidentally do another and ruin everything.I somehow sat through playing about 40 minutes of this before I just got frustrated with everything and had to call it quits. this game will make you hate mythology and wish that odysseus crashed and died so they wouldn't have anything to base the game on.

												The concept is brilliant, and it is a great effort at something new, but it sadly falls a little short of being fun to play.You are given the power of Athena, controlling wind and currents in the ocean, but the captions of the ship all seen to have a death wish and would rather break free of a current to run aground some rocks or a sandbar. It all feels like it could have been so much more than it is. Once you get a few levels in, and you are nudging ships through narrow spaces, triggering levers to open gates across the sea, while cyclops stand on the shore and throw boulders at your ships for fun, I had to stop playing. I wanted to be the cyclops more than have the buggy powers of a goddess. I commend the developer for a fresh idea, and I hope he makes a more polished sequel. For now, I cannot recommend this game unless you are curious about the concept, and then only when it's on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A short game, with a mix of both action and puzzle elements.A very interesting concept, using mouse gestures to guide boats toward the goal. Water currents develop depending on your actions, so you must plan your use of wind carefully.While this is a novel idea, it does unfortunately have some major design issues which cannot be overlooked. These include the repetitive, limited set of sounds which can often overlap; but also means playing this game at a very low resolution with no option to alter it.With lots of fun ways to interact with the environment, you may find new mechanics that will surprise you. This game will test your multitasking skills, but this game can quickly become frustrating and tedious. While I support the efforts that the developers have gone to, this feels more like a demo of a game that one might be found on an old floppy disk.Note: I was gifted this game for the purpose of me giving review.

												If Greek Mythology has taught me one thing, it's never tick off a God. After the fall of Troy the Greek fleet, lead by Odysseus (AKA Ulysses), set sail for home. But Posiden is not happy and, as Gods tend to do, decides to destroy the mighty fleet.That's where you come into play. You play as the hand of the Goddess Athena, determined to save the ships and sailors from their watery grave.In this Lemmings-inspired puzzle games lets you take indirect action to save as many greek ships as possible. You'll create gusts of wind, alter water currents, swat harpies from the sky, lasso tornados, catch falling boulders and more... You know, typical god stuff.Recommended if you enjoy a fast paced casual.			",1292,781,77,215,160,8,139

The focus of the game is straightforward: get your boats from point A to point B.  But therein lies the challenge! Cyclops throwing rocks, twirling whirlwinds, beachy sandbars and rocky cliffs provide entertaining and difficult challenges, yet its not too hard where I feel overwhelmed and want to give up.  And I didn't even make it to the more unique obstacles like sea-monsters, harpies and sirens.  Nevertheless, I was engrossed in the game.  Very fun, casual strategy game that anyone can play with just a mouse.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The lunar sales are up and i get in temptation to buy this game (i love mythology and play as Athena guiding ship sound fun)So i bought it for 0,21 cents. I instal it right away and as soon as the download finished (less than 10 sec, game is only 51 mb) and i press the start. And maybe the review begun!i really loved the game espesialy the music and backgrounds :Dso i will write the pros and consPros-Its an intresting game (as a gaming development option)-Menu wallpaper and sidebar with Athena are really beautifuly worked-simply mech's (propobly it worth mentioning in both Pros and Cons)-enjoyable if you dont get bored easily-Low price -Worth for passing some time-Really nice music-mythology lesson (well not exactly accurate but its a game not judge xD)So the cons- Sadly most missions are kinda boring and easy enough - In mission music should be selcted through options (default is no music)- you got really few choises-powers to controlSo i would suggest the game and i think its worth a 8/10, it could be better ....but..... you get what you paid for :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was meant to be played on a touchscreen tablet. I found my hands cramping up when spinning the mouse clockwise and clicking on objects several times to prevent my ships from dieing. The game is a cakewalk in the begining but as you progress it gets really difficult to the point where you may just have to skip the level. The game can be fun but also frustrating at times due to the control scheme and difficulty. The game is something you would play to kill time. I'm not sure if theres a tablet port but if so I recommend you play it on that device.			",94,1,0,0,1,0,3

												Fun little puzzle game.  You play god by controlling the oceans and wind and other things.  Its really easy to grasp the concept but it can be really tough at some levels.  I have only played the first handful of levels at the time of this review, so keep that in mind:  You are given a set amount of boats that you have to get from point A to point B, there are obstacles and some objectives.  Say you have 20 boats, you can pass the level by getting 5 boats to the objective without being destroyed, or you can pass the level with EXPERT by getting 15 boats to the end.Definitely a cool concept and I would recommend it as an interesting puzzle/RTS.  Very different from anything I have ever played so thats a +1			",147,14,2,18,9,0,21

												After 12 levels, I'd say God Game: The Odyssey is a surprisingly fun little game. The player can use wind and water currents to guide a herd of ships to their destinations while avoiding various perils, Due to the force of the elements, the ships are very hard to steer in an exact manner, so the player can only be successful if he thinks a bit forward and plans sweeping fleet movements ahead. Good multitasking is also an advantage as many of the perils can be negated by divine (ie. player) intervention, but leave the ships to their own devices for more than a couple of seconds, and they're bound to stray into their destruction.All the levels so far had adequate solutions - sometimes you can get away with being a bit clumsy if you're lucky, but luck is not required.God Game: The Odyssey is simple but fun, quality entertainment for a few hours. It's worth your money even at the full 2.5EUR price. ",293,168,25,29,36,5,62

 A very fun wind/water simulatorThe game is very simple really, you control both the water currents and the wind to make your fleet reach their destination.You are not a god, just a simple belieber praying to a goddess who sings beautifully as she is.There are often ciclops who will throw boulders at your fleet, but you can grab the boulder in mid-air and drop it on his head to slow him down a bit, guess they cant be any bolder.Can´t say more about the game as its really not my cup-tea but its rocks nontheless, but i do recommend it to those who love sim/greek/ship games though.

												Do you like puzzles? and mazes? that take a little more to think about, while enjoying  a ''sparknotes'' story of the greatest story ever ? Homers epic of the return travel of King Odysseus of Ithica to his home-island, after the great Trojan war, is told in short little paragraphs while you play '' missions/levels '' of controlling the wind and water currents as the goddess Athena, to guide Odysseus's fleet of ships back home. Using these powers as the goddess Athena you change water and wind currents for Odysseus, you help his fleet over come rocks, sandbars, cyclopes,cyclones, harpies, lotus flowers and other crazy obstacles. The gameplay is easy, fun and music is a catchy greek thing (that if needed can be turned off for concentration).  A good introduction to a good story and hope you get through the levels to finish it!.			",77,12,0,17,2,0,18

Decent TimewasterAlthough I haven't played this much, It looks like quite a good game. The concept of the game is to use water currents and wind to get through to the exit. It may sound easy but  was very fustrated at the difficulty it is to play the game. It's a decent game but the mechanics could use a little touching up but I like the idea. A nice enjoyable game to pass the time.			",85,8,0,7,7,0,4

												God Game : The Odyssey is a simple and quiet easy strategy, it's a casual game - something to ease your mind. The purpose is simple - get ships from one side of the map on another sometimes combined with simple puzzles. Moving ships is possible through making strong water streams which is why I think it would be better if it was made for smartphones. Using touchscreen could make this game much more entertaining.5/10 Average			",320,92,7,54,60,4,68
