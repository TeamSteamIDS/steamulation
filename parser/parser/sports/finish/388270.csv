												I have/had Baseball mogul 99 and 05. The 99 was awsome, the 05 version was pretty similar but ok.When i opened the 2015 version, i had to check if i havent started my 2005 one.If you take out the 1, the expansion draft team, (that featured is pretty nice. You can take any expansion team and do the drafting if you want to) and the database for season 2006 to 2015, well its almost the exact same game.Same UI, same good for 99 A.I but way to weak for a 2015 game. Very limited managing options.Basically i paid for an update roster of my 2005 version. Yep feel pretty dumb for it.. Even worst if yourelike me and loving to play oldies team. Meaning that update roster from 06 to 15 really means nothing.If you want an easy to beat and learn baseball sim for cheap this is for you.If you want something more serious do yourself a favor, spend a few more bucks and go getthe last or next to last OOTP. I only have the 2011 of OOTP but its still a much, much better sim than this last Mogul.One day i'll learn to do some research before i jump on a title even at 60% off.. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought several (non-Steam) versions of Baseball Mogul over the years and have likely spent thousands of hours playing this game over the years.  While it isn't as deep or as realistic as OOTP, it is easy to pick up and play and still offers a deep simulation of MLB starting in any season from 1901 through 2014.  If you want to actually pitch, hit and field, Baseball Mogul isn't for you but if you'd rather run the team and want a game that allows you to do exactly that without having to worry about all the complicated details, Mogul is for you.  In Baseball Mogul, you can play 10 seasons in a single setting, set your lineup on a daily basis or manage your team pitch-by-pitch.  You can even simulate 500 seasons at a time with the Play Multiple Seasons feature.  There's plenty of depth in Baseball Mogul to keep those of us who enjoy the statistical side of the sport playing for years.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Start an expansion team.  Get myself one of the top 5 pitchers in the league, Spend way more focus getting good itching together than anything else. Two years into the franchise and my team is the same as it was year 1.  As long as i dont sit and watch the computer play the game out i have a chance to win.  If i do watch, my top pitcher is guaranteed to give up several runs in the first two innings, 90-95% of the time its a home run, gives up ground balls 68% of the time.  You can set a watch to it its so consistant.  Its a 95% chance that the other team will score multiple runs in the first 3 innings regardless of wh is batting or pitching.  I was really hoping for a game that would reflect the abilities of the players on the team but it does not appear to be the case.  I can have the best team in the league and if i take them over and just watch the game, they will at best end up 500 for the season.  There are a million adventure games out there that i can play if my goal is to end up♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off  and frustrated.  This is another piece of toilet paper that escaped the flush.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
