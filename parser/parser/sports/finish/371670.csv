												It is a well done game, the level design, the graphics, the atmosphere are all fantastic. You should definitely get this game, it is fun, it handles well and you just need to see the environment for yourself.That being said, it isn't a flawless game. Now that I've completed it, I have two major issues with the game:- Most of the time, you'll get back to a previous checkpoint not because you died, but because you tried to go explore the environment, and you just reached the side of the corridor you were supposed to follow. This isn't much of a problem up until level 6, where checkpoints are scarce and it is not at all obvious where you're supposed to go.- The biggest issue, I think, is that in the two hours I've played this game, I've actually completed it, collected all orbs and have finished the three bonus levels as well.With that in mind though, I definitely recommend the game, I had fun with it. If it goes on sale, I'd say it's a no-brainer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would recommend this game. While it can be demanding on performance due to being built in CryEngine 3, it is absolutely beautiful. I have a GTX 660 TI and was running it on 1080p, getting 50-60 fps constantly. The only issues I experienced were occasional stutters, which lasted around a second at the longest, and only happened on level three.My only complaint was both the difficulty and length of the game. I was able to complete every level, including the four bonus levels, and collect every orb in around an hour and a half. The most difficult stage was absoulutely the last bonus stage, mostly due to its length and lack of checkpoints. The controls felt a bit floaty, but I adapted quickly and experienced little difficulty.Overall Rolling Sun is a beautiful game that I wish I could play more of. 7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game went somehow far below my radar! Discovered it much later.If I had to describe the game with one word only: CUTE.The game is CUTE. Graphics are very nice (cryengine is well used and runs smooth), level design is sweet (very Trine-ish) and gameplay is extremely simple.You just go around in a 2.5 D environmente with this 'rolling sun'. You can collect orbs, but the main goal is just reaching the end of the levels. At the end of the level you get a new 'power' that keeps things spicy and interesting.This is a great game for kids or for anyone who likes simple games....and in this case it has also wonderful graphics which is a nice plus.Notes: it supports 360 controller, it supports ultrawide. Graphic settings are very limited (low-medium-high presets, resolution, nothing else) and the game feels quite indie-ish (cryengine default loading screen, for instance) but is really well made.
