												Over priced game made by a company with shady buisness practices. Game used to be $5, but the second people started buying the game they raised the price to $11 and constantly shifted the price around that point; however, whenever there is a sale, they change the release date of the game in order to get it to show up on the front page, which is a very irresponsible way to advertise a 2 year old game. Disgusting. Do not buy this game at full price. If you really want to play it, pirate it, but I wouldn't even bother since there's little to no content and no new updates for over a year.EDIT: Changed the incorrect information brought up by the developers.

												Polarity is a first person logic puzzle game whose concept is vastly inspired by Portal. It has similar mechanics but at the same time it is full of originality. The companion cubes might not be as cute as in Portal, but they’re still present in this game and needed to complete the puzzles. An innovation consists in the ability of the player to switch between two polarities (red – blue) which allows him to run through gates or to jump on platforms, according to the selected polarity.The single player part consists of 14 puzzles that are not too hard to solve, with difficulty increasing  each level though. However, even the most difficult levels can be solved in less than 5 minutes each. The 10 bonus levels are slightly more difficult to figure out, but they add new fun features to the game.The coop mode, on the other hand, is quite challenging. The two players must cooperate to solve the puzzles that are much more complex than in single player mode. The levels are bigger, now consisting in multiple rooms. The path to the exit isn’t usually the same for the two players, but nevertheless, they need to work together to reach it. There are places in which timed jumps are needed while trying to grab certain objects at the same time, and these jumps are not easily performed with a controller as compared to a mouse and keyboard setup. Sadly, the game offers only local coop and not online multiplayer, so make sure to invite a friend that can be persuaded to work on those together with you, without him losing his patience. Or even better, maybe you can convince him/her to do those tricky jumps :)Don’t hesitate to buy it, especially discounted, since it is a very fun game!More reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												QUICK NOTE: At the time I'm writing this, the game is on sale at $0.54 (95% off). At that price, I could recommend the game, sure. Unless you absolutely cannot get enough first person puzzle/platforming, I wouldn't get it otherwise, especially not at $10.99.---You play as a hacker that is being paid (presumably) a large amount of money to hack into a level and steal data through some physical manifestation of your target's... network? Mainframe? God knows. The point is you have to go through 12 levels (followed by another 10 bonus levels), collecting 3 Data Fragments per level.The main gimmick of the game is that you can switch your ""Polarity"" at will - between red and blue. While a certain color, you will collide with objects of the opposite color (such as lasers, which will kill you), but pass through objects of the same color. There are also cubes (pretty much tiny Companion Cubes) which behave in a similar fashion. The cubes will power things when plugged into a slot, very similar to how Companion Cubes could hold buttons down to keep platforms suspended, etc. in Portal. Add a couple generic objects, such as launch pads and moving platforms, and you pretty much have the entire game.The game unabashedly takes a lot of inspiration from Portal: levels feel like sterile, self-contained test chambers, the only difference is that everything's dark grey instead of white, and you don't have a charming robot voice monologuing you or telling a story while you progress; the large and open, but still linear level design; and a general futuristic theme (though it's admittedly silly to mash both Portal and Polarity into such a vast genre and expect it to mean anything). You don't need to collect the 3 Data Fragments to technically ""beat"" the level - rather, you can simply progress through the level and find the exit. This is where most of the difficulty comes from. However, Data Fragments are required to unlock the next levels. They are usually poorly hidden, if not put directly in plain sight, and by simply walking around the room you can easily tell how to get to the fragments. The worst the game will do is put them behind a small puzzle, or out of your immediate field of view when you enter a room. To put it into perspective, the only levels I needed to play more than once were the first and second levels, where I missed one fragment each, because it was placed slightly out of sight or in a corner that I had carelessly overlooked.It doesn't feel good to collect data fragments because the level design is not challenging at all. The main ""puzzle"" in each level often requires next to no thinking. I beat all 22 single-player levels in about 50 minutes, and was fairly bored the entire way through. Sadly, this is why I can't say I recommend this title.It's not that the art style is uninspired and simple - that doesn't necessarily make a game bad.It's not that the music, and the general sound design for that matter, has a generic, forgettable 80s futuristic feel, which I'd normally think was quite humorous or charming - lots of devs these days just use stock royalty-free music and nobody seems to mind that too much. At least this has custom music (I think).It's not that it's trying to copy Portal - I don't see a huge amount wrong with following the footsteps of a very successful puzzle game and trying to recreate that formula!It's not even that the first person animations, head bobbing, and movement glitches make it painfully obvious this is a 3D Unity game. Or that my Logitech F310 - a fairly good controller when it comes to compatibility - would only work during the main menu and the two ""cutscenes"" that exist in singleplayer.The problem is the frankly depressing lack of content, and, more importantly, the content that IS there is unchallenging, unengaging, and simply not fun. As a developer, I'd be disappointed if I spent a significant amount of time and effort building a game and only could be bothered to make a few mediocre-at-best levels that don't even show the potential of what few mechanics that DO exist. As a consumer, I'm very confused with how this game has so many positive reviews - must just be me being out of touch with the puzzle game community. Don't expect level design that lives up to Portal, or any other good puzzle game I can think of, really.TL;DR - Game's really dry on content, and what content DID manage to find its way in is insultingly easy and boring. I'd say it's worth neither your time nor your money. Get on a crazy 95% off sale, if at all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Polarity is a fun little puzzle game, whether you are in for some achievement hunting or simply want to face some brain challenges. However, note that this game's stages are nowhere near the level of other puzzles games such as Portal or The Talos Principle. Most of the levels in Polarity won't leave you thinking for more than 2 or 3 minutes, sometimes the solution is painfully obvious, making the completion of this game feel rushed, even though there are 20 levels attached to it.The goal of the game is to reach the end chamber of each level (similar to the Portal series). In doing so, you have to make use of red and blue cubes in order to activate different mechanisms. In addition, you can change your player's ""polarity"" from red to blue and vice-versa. This is mainly useful because some walls only allow you to pass through them if you are in their specific polarity.We are presented with a poor attempt at a story, which will not matter in the slightest throughout the game and only serves as a filler. However, this isn't anything important if you don't care much about a storyline. Polarity is, after all, a puzzle game.The game looks pretty, visuals are nothing too impressive, but they're on point for its genre. Unfortunately, the game seems unpolished. There are glitches, some slightly unfinished areas, while the places which represent abyssal falls are literally... void, leaving the map in a lackluster state.The music is pretty much alright. Fortunately, there's a couple of songs attached to it, so the same tune will not repeat through each level.The store page of the game claims to feature a multiplayer factor. However, this is partly true. You can only play a local co-op campaign with your friend, on the same computer, using either a keyboard and a controller, or two controllers.Summary:Pros: + Fun little game to kill time with and relax;+ Overall a nice simplistic approach to games such as Portal;+ Collectibles and achievements, as well as the co-op campaign, encourage replayability;+ Ambient music that fits the game's setting;Cons: - Some people will find the experience lacking, due to the easy challenges and small amount of gameplay mechanics; in addition, this may lead to a fast completion of the game, maybe too fast for its price;- Unfinished, visually speaking; the pits that serve as obstacles are pitch black, as if parts of the map are just missing;- Even though a multiplayer feature is out of the question, since the player base is pretty much dead, a more advanced co-op feature would be appreciated, letting players play with their friends, each on their own system;- Occasional bugs here and there;Personal rating: 62/100 - Decent			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very good gameplay, nice graphics, they make me think about borderland's graphics, a little bit like a cartoon... It's a very nice game but VERY VERY short... But I think that the game isn't finished because at the end of the story's levels, there is a level called ""story 2"" so I hope that there will be new levels... And I also hope that the game will have ONLINE multiplayer cause it's not so simple to play at the same computer...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There’s a sad irony to how Polarity succeeds at being both bloated with ideas and creatively bankrupt.Every few levels it throws out a new mechanic - binary colored platforms, rotating switches, color changing portals, to name a few - but it barely gives time to show how they function before it decides to move onto something new. The constant stream of introductions to tools that are barely utilized keeps Polarity from ever managing to create puzzles that provide any sort of challenge.From the main campaign, to the coop levels, and even the bonus stages (which could have just as well been included with the other levels as they feel identical) every puzzle is agonizingly mundane and basic. Polarity mingles in tutorials from start to finish, as if testing my patience for repeating the same handful of puzzle types for hours on end, chuckling to itself at how cleverly it has hidden its simplicity by placing it within tediously large levels that have a habit of breaking halfway through and forcing you to restart.The cooperative mode itself feels like almost a misnomer, allowing two players to go through levels together but rarely if ever requiring they work together, or even giving both players something to do. Often one of us would simply took over completing a puzzle while the other trailed behind waiting for their turn to help, with a few instances of actual cooperation being the sole highlight of the game.There just doesn’t seem to be any point to Polarity. It exists for the sake of existing but in a post-Portal world and an increasingly crowded genre, it feels trite and uninspired. I could potentially see a lot of things from it being spun out into better games, but it’s hard to imagine that ever happening when what’s already here is so disinterested in moving forward.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

""ONE OF THE MOST FUN PUZZLE/PLATFORMERS SINCE PORTAL""Alright, look at the statement above and then look at the Polarity. You see some confusion and/or incorrect statement right? Well, yes, and that one is coming straight from the guys behind game. What a promo. This has nothing to do with Portal, it ain't have portals and it certainly ain't have guns. Only thing that these two games have in common is first two latters in their name ""PO""Polarity is usual type of indie game - puzzle & platformer. And also Polarity is usual type of game that is hiding behind term ""indie"" Man, that guy who come up with that idea of abusing indie to cover BS, should get medal. For real. Now I'm not saying game is utterly boring, it's fun at the beginning and out of those 3 hours at least 1 will be good. Just after that you get bored.If you want to get everything, game will last you around 3 hours. ""Story"" yes ""story"" itself is under hour, then there is local CO-OP that will add another one. People asked for online CO-OP but I don't really think that would make any big difference. Game have as always trading cards and also 10 easy achievements.Price point is 9,99 which is definitely not price you'd want to get it for. At the time of writing this (10/4/2017) it's in 90% off for 0,99 so this is time to get it. Soundtrack was relatively pretty nice, and it's also in discount for 0,49 so you can get that one also.Now I really have to quit with these bellow or just average ""indie"" games because when I get my hands on some AAA most definitely I'll be dead from ♥♥♥♥♥♥.Bonus Point: Portal thingie was a lie!Rating: 5/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""Blue or red forcefields?""Polarity looks on the first view like a cheap ""Portal"" rip off. But after playing it through it's mostly relaxing puzzle fun. Instead of using portals you carry and throw little cubes to switches. There are also switchable bouncers and moving platforms. But most important are the red and blue energy fields and your color change ability. We know this from ""The Flip"". Well, the puzzles get more complex and challenging on higher stages.For example you must fall through 5 alternating colored laserfields. If you have the wrong color you die. In each level there are 3 hidden data pieces to collect. The Coop levels are no real internet coop (they are just local coop). But with an additional gamepad controller + keyboard they are quite doable on your own. Altogether very joyful.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Most of these games aren’t very long experiences, but at least some are quite challenging. Unfortunately, Polarity features a few very dull puzzles that cloud an otherwise fun game. The sounds within this title, are also quite annoying after a short while since they seem to play out on a loop. Controls are decent and the inclusion of co-op is a nice bonus.

This game used to be around one dollar in asking price and I got it when it was 90% off, so around ten cents per copy. I look at the steam store and it's now 16.99.Wow.For shame that you take this game (it's really not that good) and raise the price so much Do not recommend 0/10EDIT - ""You can see the price history here except it has a few glitches:https://isthereanydeal.com/#/page:game/price?plain=polarity "" this was from the dev, who replied to my review. They also said ""The price has never been 16.99"" so when you go to this link that the dev provided, you'll see at one point it was IN FACT 16.99. April 11th was the date for those who don't want to look it up. For shame that they would do this. Very shoddy business practices. Do not buy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sometimes, it isn't one big thing, but a lot of little things.  In this case, that lot of little things make me feel like I'm playing a university student's final project for their game design class rather than a Real Game That You Pay Money For And Stuff.Here are some examples, in no particular order: There appear to be at most twelve to fifteen different textures for the entire game.  Many puzzle elements appear to be deliberately constructed to minimize the number and complexity of their textures.  To the game's credit, what textures do exist are visually distinctive, rather than the twenty or thirty variations on ""industrial, brown, and ugly"" you will find in more than a few ""modern"" games. The game's plot appears on a series of simple dialog boxes, and appears to have nothing whatsoever to do with the gameplay except insofar as it dictates the names of a few puzzle elements here and there. The game presents dual controller/keyboard+mouse prompts everywhere, except for a few places where it displays controller prompts only.  It does not adjust the prompts based on the input method, nor is it capable of accepting keyboard+mouse input while in controller mode (or vice-versa).  It does (apparently) try to guess the correct input mode, but I only know this because it guessed wrong. The ""data fragments"" you are expected to collect are in many cases simply scattered about the level.  Finding them is an easter-egg hunt, not a puzzle challenge as with (e.g.) the stars in the Talos Principle.  This appears to largely stem from the baffling design choice to provide a fixed three fragments per (short) level rather than making them rare and irregular enough to be interesting. The cubes you can pick up do not respect the inertia of a moving platform.  If you drop them onto a (horizontally) moving platform, the cubes will stay where they are and fall off. The game has somewhat limited animation.  Buttons do not depress when activated.  Objects are destroyed by instantly replacing them with untextured particle effects. The menus are mostly static and not very pretty.  They do not take advantage of the high resolution of my monitor.  This is not to say they are pixelated or otherwise mangled; they just aren't all that pleasant to look at.The smoking gun, of course, is the ""readme"" on the game's main menu, which informs us that the game was made by a small group of people coding it ""in their bedrooms,"" whatever that's supposed to mean.  Ordinarily this would inspire lenience in me, especially since I paid a mere $1.50 for it.  But the note then goes on to exhort the player to purchase the game if they enjoyed it, which suggests to me it was intended for a demo and (accidentally?) included in the final copy.  Combine that with a complete lack of such a warning on the main store page, and I'm just not inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt here.Nevertheless, it is better than nothing.  Buy it when it's 90% off.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I gotta say that Polarity is a short, but fun experience in my books, but anyway here's the review:So far, Polarity is a really fun, short, but simple game to play. It consists of 37 levels, including co-op levels, which some of them can be challenging, but not to the point of frustration. You can also collect Data Fragments in each level, which are used to unlock more levels and add a little bit more fun to the game. The gameplay is very similar to Portal, but in a different way, and that's what makes this game unique. I find the graphics pretty good and I also love the music in this game! The ambience in the music fits perfectly inside of an obstacle course/ facility setting. This game also includes achievements and trading cards, which is also a plus.In conclusion, Polarity is just a casual and pretty fun game for people to play if they're bored and have nothing to do.Should you buy this game?If you're looking for a fun game to chill with, then Polarity is the game for you.9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has been released several times now. Each time the release happened nothing had changed and the price was increaed. There is a very short campaign with little to no content. I finished the game in 4 hours, and spent the rest of the time trying to get the multiplayer to work. The mechanics aren't good and some feel like they were ripped straight out of portal, a better game that everybody should buy. Some ""puzzles"" feel so agrovating that I nearly cared about this cash grabber. The only reason i got this game was that it costed without sale $5 and with sale 45 cents. The $15 price is outragous and not worth this pitiful atempt at a game. Do not buy if you want a decent game.Edit: HAHAHAHAH. I'm laughing my♥♥♥♥♥of after the devs realised they are reciving a huge amount of flak after raising the price to $15 and decided to not only lower the price to $10 but also put it on sale as they are desprate to not have the new player's thoughts to buy the game ruined. No, I will not be changing my thoughts about this game and think the devs are even more scummy than before.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Considering the size of team that made this, it's pretty good. I enjoyed it, BUT it shouldn't be compared to Portal whatsoever. The ""puzzles"" were far too easy and most of what you had to do was more like a platformer game. You get to the end expecting Story 2 to unlock when you get the last 3 data nodes and it shows the icon, but no more after that. The bonus levels were even easier. I like the concept, but it shouldn't have been released in this state, imho.I got this for free from a contest I participated in, and I see it's for sale for $11. No way I'd ever pay that knowing there's only a little over an hour of play and the coop is freaking split screen. That's ridiculous. I think a reasonable price would be $1.99 tops.I recommend this game based on the concept, but due to it not being finished and the current price point... no.Will change if things are improved.
