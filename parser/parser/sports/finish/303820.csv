												So I bought this reading the poor reviews and thinking 'If it's based on the older rugby games, I really enjoyed them and it can't be /that/ bad. It is.PROS:Official Names for most european clubs and official names for their players.A small bit of potential for a massive re-develop of this game.Some nice implementations of kits and stadia.Nice user interface.CONS:-No way to re-map your controls, so the game is stuck in the down right stupid controls that they have implemented.Passing (1/10): Left and right pass are the same button, and it depends on where you move the thumbstick (also run)... so basically you have to run in the direction you want to pass. When the player passes, they often glitch up and pass it the wrong direction for the animation, and the receiving player glides 10 metres up the pitch to receive the ball. Forward passes are also not a rule in the game, and though this often works to your advantage, it strongly affects the realism of this game which is very bad. All of this makes for a highly jumpy and disjointed flow of the game, actually no flow at all. Running (5/10): This is /okay/, but theres no way to differentiate between jogging and sprinting as there is in most sports games. It's full speed or nothing. Kicking (3/10): Place kicking is quite easy, and I actually like the thumbstick power controls for this, however all other aspects of kicking are horrendously buggy and hard to perfect. The ball often goes in the opposite direction to where you kicked it, just like the passing, and there is no marker or guideline of where the actual kick is headed, you have to gauge it by how much you've moved the stick, and even then it bugs up and totally goes in the opposite direction.Rucks, Mauls, Scrums and Lineouts (5/10): This section of the game is /okay/ but it has serious bug problems yet again. The controls are very simple to use, and you win everything pretty much. I'd like more of a challenge, as rugby often is in this area of the game. However, when you go to pass from of the ruck or scrum, the ball more often than not goes in the opposite direction than you assigned.  Before the ruck comes the tackle, and the mechanics for tacking are buggy and inconsistent too. I've had a player just fall over, and a player on the other side of the screen do a tackling animation.OVERALL SUMMARY:Where the devs could improve: Make the game more fluid with the passing and running, and implement 'run' and 'sprint' into the game.Complete overhaul of the passing and kicking mechanics.Complete re-think of the button mapping or better button customisability.Add markers or guides to where kicks are headed and a nicer overall explanation to kicks in general.Complete overhaul of the tackling mechanicsI sincerely hope the developers care enough about this game and its community enough to try to make a change with this game, and with their next, hopefully improved game, I think should be given to the community who bought this game for free or a reduced price. The trailer and the features they have listed give a very wrong impression of the game. I cannot help but pick out the piece thats starting me in the face saying 'Rugby 15 is the best rugby simulation ever made.' IT IS NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST. Rugby 2001 by EA sports was actually much better than this. The names of the players are incorrect in the International teams, which arguably is the style of rugby most players would like to play. Overall, this game seems very rushed indeed, and I would much rather have seen a very nice polished Rugby 16 with correct game mechanics and a nice user experience, rather than this lacklustre attempt at copying a 7 year old game which was, for the record, MUCH better.

												My first impression is that the graphics for this game are very poor. To me it's like they used fifa 06 player models. I expected better, I mean hb studios had something to do with madden right so why couldn't they give us better player models?  Only 2 camera views. Really? End on and side on with no zoom or other settings!! Not great.In terms of gameplay the controls are fairly smooth and it does play well, certainly less button mashing than other rugby games of the past. Having only just started playing it is just an initial impression, I found it easy enough to do the basics at least.The game lacks the customisation options I think. You can change players names and heights and positions but I can't seem to find where you can change their appearance, maybe I am missing something or team names either. Also the super 15 squads are completely different from the international squads so it is hard to know if you changed a player's name in super rugby, whether its the same player in an international team. So far I am 50/50 on this game. It seems a little juvenile for an HD quality game (stuck at least 4-5 years ago in respect to  Graphics and models). Certainly with all the mods and customisation and player modelling RC2 seems to be the better game honestly, although the gameplay is actually quite good. If they could improve the player models then this game would be better. Unfortunately we suffer again when it comes to rugby games			",40,18,10,6,10,9,0

												Passing is floaty, players run faster than the ball moves through the air. The defensive line thus moves up faster than you can pass the ball, and you can only hit players flat footed passing from the ruck. The AI is atrocious, no Southern Hemisphere player names or real teams, there is no forward pass rule and in general it is a mess, barely playable and rarely fun.			",516,125,17,26,64,17,77

												I feel very mislead by this game. The graphics are extremely poor which I could probably deal with if the physics and gameplay weren't terrible as well. Rugby 08 was a great game and this is what is confusing, rugby 15 is literally the opposite. I should of avoided this game based on the fact that there was not any official gameplay videos pre-release, only a theatrical trailer. I honestly don't understand why the developers would release this game. It's an insult to the gaming community and the rugby community! If you are on the fence about buying Rugby15.....do not buy it, the developers don't deserve another cent.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 Rugby 08 was an awesome game to begin with. They then brought out World Cup 2011 which was basically Rugby 08 upgraded to almost HD gfx and with online play. With the this next iteration they threw the baby out with the bath water. The graphics are worse, there's no online multiplayer and most importantly they changed the whole physics and game mechanics, which was was actually what stood out for me. It felt like you were in control of the players, which is not the case with Rugby 15. I just can't believe that someone can put this game out there and charge $36 for it. Probably my own fault. They didn't show any gameplay footage before launch. Also, this game was supposed to be delayed till January and was released in November anyways. This is a testament to how bad the game really is. This game is full of bugs, does not play smoothly and the AI is really bad for a game that has no online play. ",14,1,0,0,2,1,0

												I'm a huge Rugby fan, and an avid gamer. The unfortunate nature of being both is that Rugby games aren't as diverse and popular as football, basketball or even Hockey games and very few shine through. Unfortunately if Rugby 15 is a sign of things to come, Rugby games will be under some dark times. Glitches galore, overly simple gameplay, really awful graphics and no online features to speak of, there's very little to praise the game for and even then I'd be looking at minor things, then I'm reminded that players can implode and turn invisible during a match. Not even joking.Don't buy this, save your money. I would say play the Rugby Challenge games instead but... they're no longer on Steam... well ♥♥♥♥... ",723,169,31,81,50,21,55

												I feel robbed, honestly this game would be ok, and only ok if it was free. The fact they charge people for it is day light robbery! How can they get it so wrong, Rugby 08 is better than this in every aspect, even graphics! For a game that came out 7 years later it's embarassing to say the least. I wouldn't have bought it if EA would let me activate my Rugby 08 game (which I paid for, how is that fair EA!) but I was desperate for a rugby game. I'm gutted I missed the opportunity to buy Rugby Challenge 2.Anyway, back to this god awful game! Pros: Conversions and Penalty kicks - I quite like the goal kicking, it's quite good.Cons: Everything!Where do I start!Kicking: Like I said, goal kicking is good but every other type of kick in play is terrible! You have no idea where the ball is going so it's impossible to accurately kick for territory! The other thing is the only way you can clear your lines is to box kick. You will never have time to kick for touch without being tackled! Completely stupid!Rucking: I quite like the controls for rucking, but it's way too easy. On hard I will turnover the ball in every single ruck! Needs to be harder. The other thing is it doesn't seem to make any difference if someone is isolated. You could be in a one man ruck against 3 oppostion players and still win the ball cleanly as long as you hold the right stick in the right place! Mauls: Rubbish, useless! Once it's formed you hardly go anywhere and it's on a timer! So you just go through the motions.Scrums: I like the controls but the hooking doesn't seem to do anything! The whole idea of hooking the ball back is to claim the ball for your team.But if the opposition push you back a yard or 2 you will loose the ball, even if you've already gone forward 5-6 yards!Passing: Terrible! The worst is passing out of rucks, mauls and scrums. When you pass the ball the recieving player doesn't move until he has caught it! So there is no momentum at all. As soon as the player catches it the defense is on you straight away. It makes a ""quick ball"" completely useless! The other frustrating thing is the overlap. There is no such thing in this game. For some reason if you do have the overlap, say 3 on 2, as soon as you pass out to the first man the other 2 run behind you and to the inside of you instead of staying on the wing! This means they run towards all the defensive players so you don't get the overlap! Completely stupid and frustrating.Running: Again rubbish. All the moves (side step, handoff etc.) are done on the right stick, very simple controls, again I like. But the players have a mind of their own! They hardly ever do it when you ask them to and worst part is they sometimes do it when there's no one in front of them. A few times I've had people run through a gap only to stop dead trying to hand off thin air! As I mentioned earlier though the most frustrating thing ever is the standing still when catching the ball. No running onto the ball so no room to do anything.Lineouts: Not great but it's okWeather: I can't believe this one! It doesn't really affect gameplay but my god it shows how lazy they were when making this game. Before the game you can choose the time per half, difficutly, weather and wind speed. Great apart from you have to do it before every game as it doesn't remember your preferences (again pure lazyness!). The stupidest thing though is the weather, you can have it on Random which I leave it on or you can have rain.......and that's it! So if you really wanted a game in the glorious sunshine then you just have to select random and hope you get it, pure lazyness! Referee: Might as well not be on! The oppostition is offside a lot, usually stood right next to the scrumhalf by the ruck, as soon as he touches the ball he'll get tackled, the ref never calls it. Also forward passes never get called. Very annoying as it's usually when you want a quick ball the opposition is always off side which gives up your advantage! Season: The biggest complaint about this is there are no transfers! It's very boring. There are no cut scene animations at all in this game. Not even replays! So everything just starts and ends abruptly! Makes it very dull.There are probably loads more rubbish things that annoy me about this game but I even bored of writing about it now!If this game was an early access I'd understand and I might even think you could be ok one day, but the fact this is the finished product is embarassing for the developers. They should be ashamed of charging people for this. I would even say the classic Jonah Lomu Rugby game on PS1 was better than this.....in fact it is better than this!So as I'm sure you've realised I'm not a fan of this game. I'm really annoyed that I paid for it! Would do anything for rugby challenge 2 on PC or even to just activate my Rugby 08 again! So bottom line is keep your money and hope one day someone will make a decent rugby union game! In the meantime I'm just going to look forward to the Rugby League Live 3 game!			",28,3,10,2,12,1,2

												This game is bad. More importantly - just like RWC 2011 - it's not fun.I'm torn between recommending this game so that the developers can consider patching it OR not recommending it because it seems like they didn't care in the first place.I've played almost every Rugby and Rugby League game, I buy them (on the consoles) in support of the games and hopefully that it will generate enough support to keep them going.I played this with the xbox 360 controller.Let's start on the Passing. The ball physics operate, where the ball seems it's pumped with half oxygen and the other half helium.When passes are made - it's almost too easy to pick out where the ball will be received. Unfortunately, the collision detection (or player detection) is at stage where even if you are in a prime position to intercept (which is all the time) you still won't receive the ball.It has a single pass button only. Whereas previously, it was a 2 button pass option (left button = pass left, right button = pass right). This is a horrible development because you lose the ability to direct players and have players run off the ruck. ""Apparently"" if you hold the pass button and release, the pass will skip the player next to the ball carrier - this happens occasionally. It's a lucky dip.You can use a thumbstick to highlight the receiver and pass it to them, which is a good innovation but requires some fine tuning.The games ability to judge forward passess has gone backwards from the previous itinerations. (i'm talking about Rugby 08 and RWC 11) The Kicking.All kicking in general play (grubber, chip and chase, punt and bomb) has a power indicator (which shows how much force you're using) BUT no directional indicator. This means you have to GUESS where your kick is going to go. When kicking to start play (22 Drop out, Kick restarts) you can move the player in the direction of where you want to kick, but it will only highlight the player (and move him in the direction) and not the direction of the kick.RucksThey've streamlined the ability to win the Rucks and simplified the process, however, they have moved away from one of the challenges of adding and removing players from the ruck. There is NO ability to add a player to ruck. Everything is done automaticly and then you are required to toggle your thumbstick to battle your opponent to win the ruck. This mechanic is used again for Scrums and Mauls.I could go on - (especially about the A.I., Gameplay in general, Offensive and Defensive moves etc) - but most of it would be negative.The positives are that the screens are clean. It's visually a pretty game. The money spent on something like Madden vs this make it a no contest. BUT for what it is - it's definitively a graphical improvement over the last few itinerations.To be fair, I don't really care about the licensing, I don't care which teams feature - I believe that if a fun game is made, and has alot of depth in the gameplay itself - then everything else is a low priority.In alot of ways, had this game been made in early 2000 - it would've been the greatest Rugby game ever.It wasn't and it's not yet close to being a good rugby game.This game has no depth, it's not fun to play by myself or even with others. Maybe some patching will fix some of the issues.In writing this - I've decided to NOT recommend the game.			",186,69,3,24,30,6,19

												I have been looking forward to this game for ages and I would like to recommend it but the negative points spoil the enjoyment. I really hope they can patch the gaming mechanics.POSITIVES:-Nice menusGood level of customisationGood frame rates / slick play (perhaps too fast)Good player animationsGood rucking mechanicReally like the new passing systemCPU gives away pens tooNEGATIVES:-The place kick mechanic is utter crap.  Can't get more than 15% power. Should be more like Tiger Woods golf swing rather than the awkward flick forward.When passing back to the fly half from a maul or rick, the fly half ALWAYS gets tackled before he can kick it.  Kills the ability to play a territorial game as you have to run everything.When chasing a player and you attempt a dive tackle, the animation kills any momentum and the player just drops to the floor.No method of changing pace/sprinting.Poor selection of camera views. Should ideally zoom in and out when kicking to touch.Graphics are poor quality.			",22,0,0,1,2,2,1

												Rugby 15 is actually an ok game. Graphics look pretty bad as well but gameplay is pretty good. is it worth $36 ? nope, should be lower than that may be $20. The game though is fun but you can't play ONLINE.  Should you buy the game ? Yes but when the game is on saleHopefully they release updates soon to improve the game.Update : After playing on hard, the problems actually stand out.-Bad A.I-When attacking, players move when they just get the ball. they never run onto the ball like real rugby players.-sometimes when i pass the ball to another player, that player just keeps moving forward until he gets tackled. I can't move the player , he just keeps running forward ! and It happens quite a lot which is frustrating.This game was definetly pushed out of the door too quickly and its overpriced. Can't believe on console it costs $80 !-			",124,20,1,12,8,1,3

												There is one reason to get this game. HOPE! there is a hope inside of me since rugby 08 that one day there will be a good rugby game again. clearly this game was released too early, but i HOPE that they will patch it and keep improving it.if enough people buy this game, they will release a game every year, and keep improving it every year. the basics are done, now they need to improve the details, and this could be a great game, but as i said, this game is not a finished game. pls hb studios, read this, and take it to your heart, as a true rugby fan, i have been waiting for many years now. i just want one good rugby game after rugby 08. just one! i know you have the tecnology, and i hope you get the money (you already have mine) so please please make this a good game, and just keep patching it as the money comes in, and you can release a game every year just like fifa does!
