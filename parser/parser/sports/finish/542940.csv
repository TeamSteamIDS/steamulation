												A simple game of where you make the play calls. You start your own team and can recurit. Later join faction of other teams. It doesn't take much to learn, because it just easy and fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good game, it still has some issues but has a good gameplay and, at least for moment, it became one of my favorite games. Playable under Linux.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
