												I've had ClusterPuck for a few months and have played about 20 hours of it before it's launch on Steam. All of those hours in multi-player - so I cannot speak about the newly added 1 player challenge mode added for Steam launch.ClusterPuck is a really great local multiplayer game - it's a load of fun to play, and it is even fun to say. The more friends and controllers you can get, the better. We play with 4 controllers - so usually 2 v 2, or we play the 4 of us vs 4 cpu opponents. We have an absolute blast, I can only imagine how much fun this game is with 8 controllers and 4 v 4 action!It looks a lots like a simple top down air hockey table where each player controls a puck and each team tries to score goals using the only ball. There are no fouls and no referee, meaning you can barge, block and push your opponents. There are spikes, bouncing obstacles and speed ups, all adding extra craziness to the action. Table layouts which first seem impossible get a lot easier with a bit of practice - but the table with just 2 goals and no obstacles is probably still our most played table. I would recommend a big screen or a projector for playing ClusterPuck too, as there is a lot going on when there are 8 players, and the screen zooms out to take in all the action.If you have the controllers and the friends, then ClusterPuck is one KICK♥♥♥♥♥game. It's joined MarioKart and Towerfall as one of the ever-presents when we meet up to play games. Highly recommended is you're in to local multi-player gaming.			",930,338,34,103,86,16,133

												 If you have a few friends to play this game with locally, pick this game up! It is a great party game, and if you have eight controllers, than everyone can play and yell and holler at each other in one of the best non-sport sport games I've ever played! When starting out with new players, play on the ""Competitive"" Maps as there are no traps on these maps and this allows everyone to get a feel for the game. Move onto the more intense maps if you really want to create a proper cluster of swears and jeers. The challenges are a nice distraction and do help get a better understanding of the feel of the game.  ",172,36,3,29,16,3,10

												Great game if you have 4 poeple to play with also supports up to 8 controllers. Me and my nephews had a great time. Ai is pretty good. If you need to add one or 2. You can setup how ever many you want up to 10 players in all. you can even co-op vs a team of a.i.  A.i. has 3 different settings. easy, medium, and hard. Not really a good 1v1 game since once a player gets past the other one all they have to do is drive the puck into the others goal with nothing in their way to stop them. It is still playable with 2 humans just have to add some bots, or enjoy the battle leading up to getting the puck past the other player. There are several maps with some features such as spikes,speed boosters, and bouncers that will affect your player if you hit them, these maps may make it more playable in a 1v1 environment. Overall I definitely recommend this game if you have 4 players or more and It's not bad with odd amounts because you can add bots. Don't read  too much into the 1v1 complaint I made, just making sure if you buy it you intend to play with a few extra players. It does have a single player challenge/ camapaign also.As of 2016.. no release of talked about update on forum.. also with windows 10  and xbox one controllers do not function correctly. Seems to be a unity issue also.. cuase I ahve several games that all use unity and have same issue player turns to left even when not inputting any input. It can be fixed by devs... As Knight squad is agame that the dev has fixed this issue with. Be cautious if you do not have xbox 360 controllers. Do not buy if using windows 10 and have xbone controllers.

												I've been playing Clusterpuck since it was in early development, and I can confidently say that it's my all-time favorite sports game. The controls are crazy simple (2 buttons and a joystick) so that anyone can learn to play quickly, but advanced players can find and develop strategies that add a lot of complexity to the game. My group of friends and I have gotten really competitive as a result of Clusterpuck, and I wouldn't be surprised if it ended up becoming an eSport as it is perfectly balanced and involves a lot of skill and strategy. If I had one complaint, it would be that connecting 8 controllers to a laptop is a bit of a hassle. If you buy this, be sure to pick up a USB hub or a wireless adapter for Xbox 360 controllers.

												""ClusterPuck 99"", to quickly sum it up, is a top-down simplified hockey game.  You can create a profile (or multiple ones if you have family/friends who'd like to play) and choose a unique symbol/icon with which to identify yourself.  After that, any live players (up to 8 locally) will choose their color/side and then agree upon a map.  Some maps are easy & plain while others feature obstacles that'll push you off the playing field or just kill you altogether (you'll respawn after a short period of time). This is a pretty fun game for $10 and while the AI is competent, folks will enjoy themselves much more if they can find family/friends to play with.

												This one is hard for me to review, and the only reason i gave it a yes because the game itself is so much fun. I LOVE this game. I'v owned this game for a while now, and I've logged at least 10+ hours on it before it make the jump to steam. The game itself is a fun arcade style sports multiplayer game that wouldnt feel too out of place on the N64, If you have at least two friends that you could consistently play it with, it's might be worth a buy. Its not as much fun solo, and the lack of online multiplayer causes me to seriously hesitate recommending the game in its current state. but they have added in a challenge mode which makes it slightly more exciting on your own, but it took me an hour or two to complete and the replay value is not very high for this perticular mode. Worth a buy? If you have 2+ freinds who love exciting couch multiplayer sports games that will have you yelling and screaming over epic defeats and comebacks, then yes. If you are primarily an online player, or do not enjoy local co-op, then no.			",103,23,16,3,15,3,6

												I wholeheartedly recommend buying ClusterPuck '99. My friends and I went out to buy Cards Against Humanity, but ended up coming home with a Steam giftcard to but Crawl with. We had another $10 leftover, so we looked up ""great steam multiplayer games"", or something along those lines—and came across this game. We watched the first trailer (not the live-action one) and it peaked our interest. Then we watched the live-action trailer. We were hooked. We experienced some issues downloading it because Steam was experiencing ""heavy load"" at the time, seeing as it was Memorial Day. It was well worth the wait. ClusterPuck '99 is one of the best games I have played in my life. I would be willing to give PHL Collective the funds to make as much DLC or ClusterPuck '00 if they wanted (if I had the money, but I'd be willing to work for it). These devs are awesome and so is their game. I can't recommend this enough. Just make sure you have enough controllers, because everyone's gonna wanna play.			",33,6,0,2,7,1,3

												Very hard, very fun game! At first glance it looks like air hockey, but it really isn't at all like that apart from the main point being to get the puck into the goal. But as you control your ""character"" (if you can call a red or blue circle a ""character"") you'll slip and slide around obstacles toward the goal. The spikes are deadly, the yellow bouncy things are annoying as hell, and your opponents can bash into you and knock the puck away from you at any time, which all combined make this game insanely hard and super fun. It's awesome to push opponents into the spikes and rush to victory, and super frustrating to push opponents into the spikes only to discover that you misjudged the distance and pushed yourself into the spikes too :P Visually, this game reminds me of Heavy Bullets, with the same minimalistic and vibrant atmosphere. The controls for keyboard and mouse are some of the worst controls I've ever seen. Seriously, it uses ""ESC"" as the B button, and either enter or space as A (I never could figure out which, since it's different in the menu than in the actual game). But plug in an XBox 360 controller, and the controls are great. The fact that you slide around like an air hockey puck on a low-friction surface means you have to be much more precise than you might think, and shooting can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥because your opponents don't actually have to do anything to block your shot, they just automatically catch it if they happen to be in the line of fire.Clusterpuck is aptly named, it's one giant clusterpuck of insanity, but very enjoyable insanity nonetheless. And since it's on sale for only a dollar right now, there's no reason not to try it out! It's probably not for everyone, especially people who ragequit easily, but if you enjoy difficult games then this will be right up your alley.EDIT: Forgot to mention, this is mainly a local multiplayer game. There is no online multiplayer, which is really inexplicable since it's a game made for playing with other people. But if you're like me and don't have friends, you can add bots to your match to play on your team and the opponent team.--------------------------------------------------------------------If you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

												It's an awesome game if it's on sale for $1, but without online multiplayer I wouldn't even consider paying $10 for it.Edit: Looks like the devs ended up releasing an xbox version of the game, and even added a map maker. They then promised to update to PC version to have one as well. That was nearly a year ago, and they haven't said a word since. Looks like it's been abandoned.Edit 2: After more than a year of no response and 0 updates to a seemingly abandoned game, they finally patched the PC version of the game to match the console versions, adding a map creator and 2 maps.

												No online multiplayer and the keyboard controls are brutal (doesn't auto-rotate with WASD like it does for controllers).However, if you have got a few controllers (we use DualShock 4) and can get some people to come over, this game is an absolute blast. It's a simple game. Every player has the same stats and there's only three moves: tackle, shoot, and charge shot. I'm not even sure when to use the charge shot. Add in some environmental hazards like bottomless pits, spikes, reflectors and turbo plates and it takes the game to another level. The computers kick our♥♥♥♥♥even on easy but I'm not so sure if they are smart or if we really suck.My wife said ""that's the best dollar you ever spent.""			",23,16,0,10,13,1,17

												It seems that the local multiplayer craze of the past few years has hit a peak recently. The genre has expanded out far and wide, and many games that would have been praised before are now plagued by obscurity and fighting amongst their talented competition. ClusterPuck 99 had been out for some time on Desura before hitting Steam at the beginning of 2015, one of five games bearing the genre’s tag released in the month of January. Steam in 2015 can be a vicious marketplace, which is why I was pleased to see ClusterPuck come out on Xbox One earlier this month. I had found the game on Desura ages ago, was eager to see what improvements had been made in the meantime, and what console specific fun I could have with the title. For better or worse, I found that ClusterPuck 99 has stuck to its roots as an insane multiplayer arena that requires swift aim and a roomful of friends.NOTE: This review was written primarily using the Xbox One version of the game.Want to know more?

												An absolutely fantastic game that offers thrilling competitive gameplay on the one screen with up to 8 players. A must buy for party game goers and people looking to play more with friends. Enjoy! :D			",775,155,50,97,56,10,92

												If you know what your friends actually look like and have multiple controllers ( 8 player support ) you will love this game. Easy to play but you will know which one of your friends you want on your team.Cons: Wife seeing the bill after I bought 4 more controllers Great game with responsive controls and competitive gameplay.
