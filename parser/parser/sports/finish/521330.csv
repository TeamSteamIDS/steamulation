Early Access Review
								Just decided to pop in and try out the game for hour and was mildly surprised. The game itself is very early access so you’re going to run into bugs and a few things feel unpolished. That being said I feel there is some real meat on this game and possibility to succeed. As it is now try it out, 30 days of free play on the heroes will do nicely to help you find which ones you might enjoy. On that note I would recommend the game. But for the dev's here’s a small list of critique that may help you continue to build the game and the community.DO's:Sound:  Keep refining content, the name of the game here is juiciness. If I play Nyd I want that chain gun sound, I want to feel the impact from the character.Assets: The environments are beautiful so keep building areas with more character and feeling. Create as if they were lived in.Animation: I’m no animator but I can feel the characters lack some weight in their attacks. This area of the game I feel needs lots of tweaking as there are lots of characters to manage. UI: Make player health more obvious, if I have to look at my health bar to know I’m close to death. It probably needs reworkingGameplay: Skull ball is fun but ironically it may be more fun with a normal ball. Perhaps create a large skull design in zbrush on a sphere and see what you get. Other game modes seemed okay but Im sure you could get better feedback on those from other peopleDONT's:Create more maps or heroes: Its too early to be creating new content you have framework set up so utilize it and refine it.Ignore your user base: This isn’t an issue now but its pretty common in free to play communities. When a game starts to fail its often pretty obvious to the players but not so obvious to the devs.Overvalue your product: The current cost of heroes seemed a bit high. Mitigate this by allowing players to rent or try out the characters they like. Remember free weekly rotations works as well.  Thats all! I'll be sure to try out the game periodically when i have time.			",79,5,0,10,6,0,19

								Edit: Just wanted to give massive props to the developer for replying to pretty much everything anybody posts at the moment. It's rare in my experience for a dev to be quite this courteous, active, and polite. So yeah, I have a lot of faith in this game getting consistently updated over time.Nice game, good polish, and +1 that you can play with bots even though they're smarter on some modes than others. Really hope more people will download this considering it's free and all, since I think it's intended to be played mostly by human players. If the developers don't make it easier to figure out who's online or make the bots more aggressive, I'm worried I'll have to change this to a negative review, which would be a shame since I see a lot of potential in the game. But as it stands there are enough good points that I hope people can give this game a fair chance.Graphics are good (it's UE4 after all) but there's also a nice and refreshing minimalist feel to the interface, designed to be played quickly and in little bites like the Unreal Tournament series. (That's the feel I got at least.)So many MOBAs insanely make themselves pay-to-play on Steam, like $20 or more to even purchase the original game. To me it's a genre that's meant to be free, at least when you enter it. Not to mention, how many have Mac versions from the start? So I hope people will give this a try.			",70,25,1,16,22,0,8

Diverse PvP GameTuebor is a game that offers quite lot of game modes some innovative some pretty basic for arena shooter games, but the sad part is that this game kinda falls short which certain aspects such as UI is not up to today's standards and the game has almost no players so you end up playing against bots, i just don't see how indie company could make the game grow to significant stage where there would be healthy matchmaking and not long que times. The Level designs are rather Good so are the character designs, however animations & sounds are rather lackluster.			",424,179,5,53,33,3,42

								Tried to find a match on all modes + maps, but literally nobody plays this.... Will there come more over time or will this stay a ghost town? I know this game just came out, but there needs to be some kind of player base even in the first days, so more people have an opportunity to gather. Otherwise there will be only a couple of people downloading game, finding no matches, then leaving again. So no one actually gathers up in the game to create some kind of basic player base.Even though this seems like an interesting game, but if no one will be playing, I will turn the thumbs down.

								Downloaded and gave this game a try, in my opinion it isn't worth playing at the moment. The graphics in general are nice, the amount of characters is cool and they're diversity is appealing but the overall gameplay is terrible and has alot of problems, for example; hits on enemies not registering, sounds not working properly, spawning under the map with no hope of escaping except to return to main menu, allies buffs blinding you and enemy bot AI acting weird. There is no doubt in my mind that this game has potential but in it's current state although playable (if you can call it that) in my experience is completely unenjoyable.In summary I rate this 3/10. Uninstalling it now.			",137,17,0,16,12,0,21

								It’s hard to believe this game is an indie game. It has multiple game styles and a load of different characters. I had a ton of fun goofing off with friends, getting lifted and dropped off of an overpass by the enemy team, getting frustrated by huge waves of enemies killing off my squad, and generally being a BA.

Early Access Review
								Early access, so they’re still working out a few issues, but Tuebor has been a lot of fun thus far and has a ton of potential. They’re boasting an impressive lineup of thirty heroes  -  varying from tank/fighters to support/healers to glass/cannons with a few of them falling somewhere in between the generic castes  -  and they have a couple different game modes available, from PvP arena shooters to cooperative PvE battlegrounds. I’ve only figured out how to play a couple of the heroes well enough to carry my weight in a match, but my favorite mode so far is Skull Ball. Skull Ball is... think Shaolin Soccer with machine guns and Force chokes. It’s fast paced and combines full-on PvP while trying to score a goal. Team Annihilation is a close second-favorite... Both of the maps currently available, one 4v4 and the other 5v5, have very unique atmospheres, keeping the players in close quarters without feeling claustrophobic. Death and Glory is reminiscent of a MMO-style raid or dungeon, pitting us against alternating waves of trash and bosses. Capture the Core (capture the flag) is fun, but there were a few issues syncing player and core spawns. According to the patch notes, it’s been fixed in the latest beta. I've been fortunate enough to participate in a number of streaming events and it's been an absolute blast to play full matches. Really hoping this takes off on gold release.			",9,1,0,3,1,0,4

								Tuebor is a RPG/3rd Person/Moba still in its early development stage, but after playing a few hours with some of the devs, i was very satisfied with my time spent playing the game. The characters, Maps, Sound Design overall are well detailed and creative, and even when a few technical hiccups popped up, i still found myself enjoying the game. Enjoyed the pretty large character buff and skins availible in a game thats been playable for only a few months, with much more coming as the game devs progress on making the game more polished and balanced. If i had any complaint, it would be minor ones such as some character being a little OP, but was happy to know that the devs where already aware of these problems and plan on fixing them. The developers and community managers are very smart and laid back people, treating this game as sort of a passion project. I was pretty thrilled to learn that, even though they need to make the money to pay there team members, they are trying their best to not be forced into a pay to play model, where you cant progress any further if you dont fork over $100's of dollars, but hey, they got bills to pay and mouths to feed, and dont have that Blizzard money to give everything away for free. They are also well aware at some of the issues in the game and are constantly working on improving and polishing up the game to appeal to the high standers of AAA gaming communties, who to be honest, always set their bars to high. For the small team of people making this game, i have high hopes for them and the future of Tuebor, and plan on playing and streaming the game myself to help promote it to more like minded people. If you havent bothered to try it yourself, or putting it off for some reason, please do take some time to check this game out! You mite actually see the potential this game could have when its officialy released.PS: I am not a robot, nor payed in anyway to write this review. If i truley hated this game, i would give them my two sense. I actually had heard of this game in a Discord community, and put it off for a bit to play some other games, but i am truley happy that i finally had the oppertunity to play this game for the first time, especially with the devs, and just wanted to make that clear.

Early Access Review
								So I played a game or two with my friend TheMasqueraider and let me just say, WE KNOW this game is in early access. Now let's just get right to it.~After we made our accounts and logged in we got a good look at all of the characters and such and everything looked pretty cool. The graphics weren't bad (I was running Maxed out aka ""Epic"") And each character looked fine.We decided to try out the survival co-op mode first since normally we like to play PVE or on our own to get used to the game.I host our little game choose the only map available and continue. We choose our characters and I add bots to the game. The game starts and after the loading screen My friend says he fell through the map. I look around to confirm and he is nowhere to be found at spawn or anywhere in the map. I check to make sure he is in fact in MY game and it says he is.So then we restart and try again. I choose a different character and we start again. The game starts and my friend did NOT fall through the map this time so we just jump right into the game and finally get to play the game. I notice my mini-gun sounds like some sort of pea shooter. (I chose the character with the mini-gun and riot shield.) The sound on the gun doesn't bother me too much as it is an EAG. We start killing enemies and I notice my friends hits don't quite seem to hit most of the time. (He chose the spider chick? idk her name) The game continues and the AI seems pretty dumb on both sides (allied and hostile) our allied AI keeps casting some sort of ability that blinds myself and my friend Masque and we get frustrated. My friend, fed up with not being able to hit anything. Rage quits and quickly comes here to write his review (I assume idk).-I continue playing as I am actually enjoying the time-killing gameplay. I go afk for about a minute and come back to one of our generators being destroyed and a bunch of enemies named (experiment) running at the speed of sonic the hedgehog and literally 1 shotting (or insta-killing) all the allied bots and myself at our spawn point.----I wouldn't say this game is terrible since it is an EAG and I don't believe I have played enough of the game to really grasp what it has to offer and rate it fairly. But I'd still like to give my opinion on the game as is.I would say though that this is a good attempt at a game it's not terrible but not 'good' yet. I believe the devs can improve this game and make it great.Goodluck @: Strength in Numbers Studios, Inc .I look forward to seeing how this game progresses.--------------End of Review | DOR: 9/16/2016 | Rating: 4/10			",224,21,2,19,11,2,17

Early Access Review
								(edited on 2-8-2017 to reflect recent fixes)Game OverviewAt a glance you may mistake the game for Smite but you’ll soon find its much faster paced and will take much more practice to nail your character’s combinations. The 30 characters come with 4 unique abilities each and are divided into 4 classes: Specialist, Assault, Support, and Defense. Your team’s success will require a balanced combination of choices and a commitment to fulfilling the role of your selected character. The control scheme will play similarly to other 3rd person MOBA titles however abilities are much less telegraphed and require a great deal more precision to master. Tuebor’s game modes are objective driven and draw inspiration from titles like Rocket League and the Unreal Tournament series. Let’s Take a look at the available game modes.Skull BallThink Rocket League on foot with an arsenal of weaponry where killing the other team is just as important as scoring! Your team can boost how far they hit the ball by killing opponents granting a significant edge. Try to score while watching out for the unique environmental hazards that each map has to offer. The new Breath of Fire map is particularly dangerous as fire breathing skulls always seem to be looking your way. Death and GloryA group of six attempts to kill off waves of bad guys while defending two reactors that power your Translocators (necessary for respawning you and your friends). As an added bonus, or possibly hazard, keeping the basement free of bad guys will reward you a salvage bonus for every wave you pass without the experiments contained within being released. Flooding the basement with lava is an option but you’ll forgo the extra salvage and have to deal with more baddies targeting the reactors.  Capture the CoreFeaturing chaotically large 8 person teams a single core spawns in the middle of the map, capture it and return it to your base. Take over forward spawn locations and turrets to give your team an edge. Keep in mind that you can’t attack while carrying the core, so you’ll have to rely on your teammates ability to defend while you scramble back to your side of the map.Team AnnihilationClassic team death match, with no other map objective to be a distraction you’ll have to master abilities and hone your killing skills. The team with the most kills at the end of the time limit wins so stay close and watch each other’s back!Playing in any game mode will reward your account with “salvage”, an in game currency that can be used to purchase skins and upgrades that occupy customization slots on each of the 30 characters. Where you spend your salvage will have a profound impact on your character’s performance. Purchased skins are more than cosmetic with camo skins offering an increased chance of dodging attacks and arctic skins extending ability range. Spending salvage on various modules can boost energy, armor, shield, and other stats. Use these upgrades to build characters that suit your play style, no two players will build their heroes the same with an extreme amount of customization choices.CriticismKeep in mind that the game is still in Early Access and FREE while SIN Studios polishes the game. This is refreshing to see in a world where Early Access is too often abused not to improve the game but to accelerate revenue. That being said there are still some bugs to work out! If you put effort into it you will be able to get your character stuck in certain spots or find exploits where NPC bad guys won’t be able to get to you. I have also managed to get myself outside of the normal boundaries of the map a few times. The developer is working on fixing this issue and the others mentioned. We (Infirmary Gaming) have witnessed frequent patches that directly address our concerns and improve the game in general. Do your part! Give Tuebor a try during Early Access and if you do find any bugs or have constructive criticism join the Sin Studios Discord server and let the Devs know yourself! Infirmary Gaming is a proud supporter of Strength in Numbers Game Studios. Indie Developers are critical to the growth of the gaming industry we appreciate their mutual support for Infirmary Gaming Community and the development work they do!

								OK...so...I never actually PLAYED this one. It shows 3.5 hours because I gave up trying to figure out how this ""free to play"" game was playable for free. Then forgot it was still running in the background.*shrug* I thought it looked kinda cool....the characters were an interesting mix of several genres...though most all of them said ""attack"" or...""tank""...for their classification. But that's ok...but unfortunately that's about as far as I got.I would try and select a character that was ""free"" but it would not let me move any further in the event system until I payed money. Am I missing something here? I am a little old and a little slow at times, I've been known to overlook the fairly obvious occasionally. But this game has me stumped, and thinking that 'FREE' means different things to different people.If anyone can enlighten me as to what I am doing wrong, I'd appreciate it. I'd like to give the game a shot like any other, and in the spirit of this I will thumb it up for now assuming it is my lack of brain cells and not the games' fault.			",81,9,4,16,8,0,6

								Early access game that looks absolutely beautiful.  It's got a bit more to go, but what I played was great.  It runs fast which is great because I've played some early access games that killed my computer.  Well developed characters each with developed abilities.  Different game modes that are also well developed, I really enjoyed Skull Ball.  A small arena where you need to play soccer while at the same time defending from attacks and doing your own.  The maps are really well done. They feel like proper professionally made and designed maps.  All around a pretty damn sweet game.			",27,4,0,2,7,0,5

The game modes are nice and the server work fine for me coming from someone who lives in the EU and played on NA servers. There is a big veriaty of heroes to choose from but the healers aren't rewarding enough. Maybe the game should tell you if you saved a teammate with healing the same way it does when you kill an enemy.			",40,3,0,3,4,0,0
