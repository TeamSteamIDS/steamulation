Early Access Review
								Having put many hours into the alpha and beta builds pre-steam, my overall impression is a good one. Pros:	+ The game is tons of fun. Seriously, if you've ever messed around in a Spiderman game, or just wanted a sort of parkour type arcade game, this game is so for you.+ Maps are large, expansive, and varried. There's tons of challenges to do, leaderboards to challenge others on, and hidden collectables. It harkens back to an older feeling generation of games. + Tall skill ceiling, but very satisftying to learn. You will struggle at first, but there is always noticable improvement. And there is also always room to improve.+ Feels as good, if not better on mouse and keyboard as on controller, so don't feel as if you need a controller.+ Game just plays so well. It's a simple concept exicuted very well. The game's physics have improved since alpha and feel very satisftying. Cons: - The game built by a single buy, and it does show. It is not hard to find yourself clipped between a pillar and a wall, unable to escape. Graphics are also not cutting edge.- Camera can be wonky, especially on controller.- A passable tutorial at best, I would say unintuitive. My advice is go into all the pillars in the tutorial level. They will introduce basic game mechanics. And try all the buttons to see what they do.This is a game clearly developed by one man who loves what he does, and is very good at it. It is all apparent. This game harkens back to the old Spiderman games, as well as classics in general. It is very much a make your own fun sort of game. You have to know how to entertain yourself, even with the world challenges/leaderboards. A true open world game, with ideas exicuted well for this little seen parkour genre game. I would highly reccomend it to anyone who reads this and goes ""hmm this game sounds enjoyable"".			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has a very interesting idea, where at some point in the future the sport ""energy hook"" is implemented and becomes an acclaimed sport and joined the action lovers. Risking his own life to maneuver in mid-air and show that you are the best of all, using your jetpack and electrical cord. The system is identical to that of Spiderman, where the web is actually a rope, super jump your jump with propulsion, and the dash is simply a second function of the jetpack.Interestingly you can combine both skills to go faster and faster and also to access the most difficult places. With this you can jump the highest place to be able to reach and so do as many tricks as possible before are, of course, falling to his death.Every stage you have a different area to explore and find challenges, getting medals for their progress. There are also collectibles scattered throughout the stage.The music of the game for the most part are good with rhythm, I think techno, however the sound effect may be considered annoying (especially when it is at high speed and you can hear the sound of air being cut).While looking through the images and video in the store, I believe the scenario seemed much more beautiful and interesting, which in game it seems that owed ...Parkour moves to boil down to walk through the wall and movements (said maneuvers) are few and very limited.There are 6 stages in total and some challenges to be met which are few and simple, not to mention the areas despite having an operating level are completely lifeless which leads the player only have one thing to do leaving the proposal (a large and exploitable area) somewhat limited.The game can be rather considered fun, but I knew not specify how long it will be for you and honestly if it is to play something that looks like a beta of another, prefer to play the original, in this case I refer to spiderman 2 which is genuinely much more fun.NOTE: 4/10PS: when faced with the walls of buildings was often possible to see inside (visual bug)For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/ Also you're welcome to join in the fun in our Steamified group.
