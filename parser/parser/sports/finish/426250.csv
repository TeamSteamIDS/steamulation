								The idea is nice and the underwater bowling alley looks good. Unfortunately there isn't a lot more than that. There is one unfinished baseball area that looks very poor and that's all. The price is way too high for the content even for an early access game. I like the idea and I hope it will become a good game at some point in the future.			",29,29,1,2,21,2,9

								Until Updates are made this game in it's current state should be free or much cheaper ($0.99 at most).  The bowling game is not even similar to a real bowling experience as you bowl 3 rounds with 3 balls and no score is kept.  Just abysmal.The baseball game is very inaccurate and for some reason they give you a bat in both hands rather than designating one.  Furthermore, actually attempting to make contact with the ball is a far greater challenge than attempting to find a positive in the only other experience available at such time with this game; the lackluster and worthless bowling experience.  Just stay away from purchase as this is not even a complete demo at this point.  I wish there were some way to get a refund for such a steep price for a nearly worthless expenditure of your time and money. ",102,38,2,10,15,1,1

 It's actually not that bad! Although there are only 2 gamemodes at this point in time, I've had a whole lot of fun playing this game with some of my friends. The envrionments are very pretty for a VR-game and the actual sports are very intuitive. At first we had some trouble figuring out the menu but after a few minutes and some exploration here and there we figured it out.I guess what most reviewers don't see, is that this game isn't a singleplayer, ""I stand alone in my room""-type of game. It's a party game made for you and your friends to enjoy.  Good Bad       New Patches are coming frequently! Really cool concept, reminding me of Wii-Sports Devs actually listen to their community Very pretty compared to other HTC Vive games Really cool partygame! More things to come!  Really early alpha Menu sometimes a bit clunky No actual twists to the Sports I keep hitting the damn dispenser in the baseball game ",358,136,6,50,63,5,60

								Really don't know how this could have been priced so high. Feels like a quite unfinished demo. Bats (2?) dont work for the baseball game (?) well and bowling only sorta works. Twenty dollars?			",155,63,5,1,39,5,4

								Bowling is amusing for a minute, if it was at a much cheaper price tag I could accept it. However in it's current state it's not even close to being worth the entry price. Refunding...			",412,86,85,6,82,13,6

								I think this has potential, I wouldn't buy in unless you're interested in actively helping shape the game or until the game has some notion of progression (score tracking, leaderboards, difficulty settings, challenges etc) but this could be the Wii sports of the vive and that's pretty exciting.
