												I work as an engineer for a Formula 1 team, and what impresses me about this game is how it has captured the things which make a race weekend exciting while stripping away the stuff that would make every race weekend a chore (aka too much like a real job!).For example, the short practice sessions - lots of complaints about those but I have to say there is probably no racing team that would ever say they've had enough practice - you always want more, and it's a case of prioritising what you want to learn about. The game forces you to make this interesting choice - do you work on setup or prioritise running laps on a set of tyres to squeeze out that last few % of performance?In real life teams use a combination of experience and simulation to do the biggest chunk of setup work before the race - the practice sessions are just for fine tuning. The game gives you hints (and the track map should give you an idea) of whether this is a high speed / low speed circuit. I've found it's possible to get fairly close on your first go by taking an educated guess, but you won't get a perfect setup without long practice sessions, good driver feedback and a good starting guess - and nor should you! Getting a perfect setup is elusive just like in real life. And just like in real life you could keep a note of your setups and give yourself a better starting point for next year!There are some things that could be improved - copying setups from one teammate to another would be handy, and at the moment there is a lack of strategy tools - you can't pre-plan setups for a particular lap (so you have to remember any strategies in your head) and it's hard to figure out whether a 2 or 3 stop is faster. Changing strategy on the fly during the race is made difficult because you can't get a list or a graph of your driver's laptimes since the start (at least I haven't found one) - this would allow you to compare and see if you have more pace / less pace than the guy in front and at what point your laptimes start to fall off the cliff (so time for a tyre change).But overall I can promise you this is a really great (and fun!) impression of the real deal.

Update 2017.02.24:I've just played a couple of hours with the new 1.3 update. Some excellent changes have been added, the top in my mind is the change to qualifying to allow you to have the driver do the outlap warming of brakes and tyres rather than having you (the player) do it. Really a change that makes the whole game much better since your role in qualifying is now that of the team manager rather than also the driver too. And now there is a rules option for qualifying to change it to be like Formula One with three segments where after Q1 and Q2 the slowest part of the field is eliminated. A third, more minor but still important change is to the emails that ask for interviews from you. They now have actual effects on the drivers or team and so really mean something. And there are a host of other great changes. Makes the game even better.Update 2016.11.23: After now having played just over forty hours on the game, I can continue to give the game a positive thumbs up. I have played a season and a few races at the bottom of the three tiers of competition, and most of one season in the top tier. The game does have a few bugs which hopefully will be fixed in the first planned patch. Otherwise however it is really quite good in the long run. I would categorize the game as something you experience rather than something you play to win. I spent 19 hours in the lowest tier, and now 21 hours in the top tier where I have not yet finished my first season. You really can spend a couple of hours of real world time between the end of one race and the end of the next one. You manage finance, part design, and just running your team, including evaluating drivers and staff. And then at a race weekend you spend time preparing for practice, overseeing practice and the same for qualifying. And then comes the race and you are calling the shots for your two drivers regarding fuel use, tire wear and pit stops. Now I do tend to play slow and fret over every detail, so most folks will probably spend only half or a third of the time that I do in a season, but if you really want to get down to the nuts and bolts of running a team, this is the game for you.Original Review:My impressions after a couple hours of play...Much, much better than the mobile game. Seriously. Very seriously. I think I spent the first hour just going through the tutorial that puts you right into the first race of the season and then walks you through every menu screen and option. Really top notch presentation. There are some compromises, because it is game that has to be actually played by a single player rather than a huge team of technical specialists, but wow the developers certainly tried to give you the feel of running a race team. Little things like how your driver develops a relationship with their mechanic which improves over time. Or that you can build parts that might not pass scrutineering, which happens after each race and could get your results invalidated. Or that the series rules change over time, like different tires or removing fueling. And there was even a case of a track changing it's configuration from one season to the next. Truly an awesome effort, and this is from someone who started back in nineties with different racing management games. And so far (two hours), no glitches or crashes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
