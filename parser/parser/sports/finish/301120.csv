								(9.6 / 10) Well worth the eight year wait - Author: archibalduk of EHM The Blue LineMore than eight years after the Eastside Hockey Manager series was put on indefinite hold, the undisputed king of ice hockey management is back. A lot has changed since EHM 2007 was released in September 2006; not least the rise of the likes of Steam and social media. These platforms make niche games cheaper to launch and easier to market. Indeed, Eastside Hockey Manager: Early Access (or EHM:EA for short) is being released exclusively on Steam and is likely to be heavily marketed using platforms such as Twitter and hockey forums such as The Blue Line and HFBoards. Against this background maybe, just maybe, the game will become a more viable project than it was before.This new iteration is being released as an Early Access game. The game will be continuously developed over the coming months with regular updates being pushed to users via Steam. To call it a beta version would be grossly unfair and inaccurate. The game is highly polished. It’s simply that the game will be developed whilst we play. The thinking behind this approach is to test the waters. If the game generates enough sales then it will return as an annual release. If not, then it won’t.Full Review -> http://gmgames.org/eastside-hockey-manager-early-access-ehm-ea/review/ ",0,0,0,0,3,0,0

												I'm giving this game a negative review despite loving it. The reason is that I want to draw attention to the negative sides that I don't feel get mentioned often enough.First of all, there are still bugs in the game. After so many  itterations, one would have thought that things like trading and contracts would work flawlessly, but nope, you'll still run into situations where you need a save file editor or create another GM just to get the game to follow hockey rules.My other and biggest issue is with the way this game compensates. Let me explain. I've been playing EHM since the very first version, probably spent thousands of hours on all versions together. One thing you have to realize is that this game is essentially a numbers generator, working with probability and such. Thing is, if you've been playing this game long enough, you'll find ways to build fantastic teams, with (probably)  the best coaching staff in NHL history and you can pretty much win the Stanley Cup with any team by your second, in a worst case scenario 3rd season. But! The game detects when your team or player start producing extraordinary numbers, and it will start compensating to keep things ""realistic"". Won too many Stanley cups in a row? Well, you'll lose in the playoffs, no matter what you do (tested by replaying the same saves when things got weird on countless occasions). You'll win with the same team next year, but the game won't let you win, say 4 times in a row, just because. Same if your team is scoring too much. Built a scoring machine with 1st line level players on your 3rd line? Well, bad luck, because you're gonna get punished by periods where your team will refuse to score, until your goals scored total returns to a ""normal"" value, then, without changing anything, you score again. Same goes with winning games. Winning 90% of your games mid season? Well, here's a drought, it'll end once you're around 75-80%, then you'll dominate again and the cycle repeats.Bloody hell EHM, let me build super teams if I want to, don't punish me for finding ways to work the system. Sheesh! What's the point in learning to play a game if it will punish me for that and promote mediocrity?Otherwise, I really enjoy this game and I value the work they put into it, it's a great game, but the compensation system can be incredibly irritating.

								I had never played EHM prior to yesterday, I had followed the NHL afew years ago but had only recently watched ice hockey during the Olympics. The reason I gave this a go was because of its low price and the fact it seemed on the face of it similar to Football Manager. Whilst daunting at first I quickly got to grips with the interface and the basics of the game, whenever I hit terminology or anything I was unsure of a quick google was more than enough to gain an understanding of what I need to know.If you're someone who enjoys Football Manager but would like an alternative to play I'd highly recommend it, especially at the price it's at. If you love hockey then this should be a no brainer.I'd also highly recommend downloading roster updates and graphcis packs should you get the game to give yourself a more complete experience!

												Excellent game for anyone wanting to be the gym of their favorite team and bring them a stanley cup(except for the Maple Leafs, that's impossible pls). If your favorite teams are the oilers, hurricanes, panthers, hurricanes, etc, it will take a few years to get the Stanley cup. You need to build the team with good depth players, have good rookies in your system, and a decent top 6. Time will fly as you are trying to build the perfect time. There's a lot of depth in this game. You can control coaches, scouts, practices, analysis the draft, team tactics are really detailed(there are individual tactics for each of your players and also for each of the lines you can either choose or ask your coach).Overall, this game satisfy my constant need of hockey when there is no game to watch.

												I'll list out what happened to my team in history and you be the judge. NOTE: This was after loading the real league DB- Selected the Flames- Had a mediocre first year. Ended up 4th last. Wideman was a superstar!- Was able to Draft Austin Matthews 4th overall. - Young stars played well but asked for small bridge contracts (3.5 for Gaudreau and 5 for Monahan) in the end.- Was able to trade assets like Juri Hudler and Jonas Hiller for young stud prospects like Kerby Rychel, Oliver Bjorkstrand and John Gibson- This salary dump and low contracts allowed me to get Jamie Benn of Free Agency for 3 years at 8.5 mil- Existing Flame prospects Poirier, Klimchuk, Anderssen and Bennett started to shine.- The next year with these players resulted in an early playoff exit against the OIlers, with Poirier getting the Calder trophy on a line with Monahan and Gaudreau. Damn you McJesus!- The second year ended up losing in the quarter finals to the Stars who went on the win the cup with Voracek in place of Benn, Klimchuk started to whine about his ice time and the Calgarian Media.- The third year, refused to comment to media about our chances and won the cup in dominating fashion. Majority of players were in that 24-27 sweet spot. Gibson won the Conn Smythe. Hartley won the Jack Adams- The following year, couldn't afford Benn despite letting an old Wideman go to free agency, Matthews wanted 5 mil a year. Managed to get 35 year old Pavelski and 31 year old Simmonds on sweet deals in free agency. So far, I'm 3-5-2 though. Feeling the cup hangover as there has been LOTS of little injuries to start the season and a T.J. Brodie 3 game suspension.All things considered. The game is fun, largely accurate, though not fully believable in some aspects. The free agent list is obsurd. The salaries that some quality players are asking for are rediculously low. High end talent costs a LOT in dollars (8 million plus). The salary cap never goes up. There are some bugs regarding team record notifications that make no sense and are poor english. Some menus are tedious to mantain. Trade system is fairly good. Scouting is annoying as it doesn't auto reset for Entry Draft scouting - scouts go idle. I'll likely play another two seasons and stop forever, but worth it if your a GM junkie.			",19,6,0,5,3,0,11

								Let's assume you've never played the EHM-series and you like hockey. In that case - the game is just for you! You can make your own God-awful decisions like an actual Oilers GM! How cool is that!Well.. kinda cool. Yeah.The EHM-series was created by the Finnish Risto ""Riz"" Remes and picked up by the SI Games (Sports Interactive - Football Manager [the ol' Championship Manager] and OOTP-baseball-manager-thingye). That's how it's been for about fifteen years or so. And it's awesome that the few that enjoy manager-games that are just basically Excell-sheets with a bit of graphic.The game is awesome as it was in the year 2006 (?) when EHM-07 was released. And quess what? IT'S STILL THE SAME DAMN GAME! The engine is the same and the mechanics work the same way. It even has the same glitches (the junior players refuse to sign to the team, the international games happen at the same time as the European leagues etc). Ok. The year is now 2015 in the game or something like that, but nothing much.Don't get me wrong - I love the game. I actually bought it three times when it was the crappy Sega-distribution that allowed you to install it three times and three times only. (So when you must re-install Windows - there goes one licence. Oh yay). Now it's yours eternally when you buy it from Steam but that's prolly the biggest change in the game.I know it's still an early release (though 10 years old), but I really hope that the developing theam has the courtesy to update the game A LOT or it's just a cheap way to make some money.Summary: You like hockey? You hate the way EA handles the managing-bit? Bored of Maso Hockey Manager? Yeah. This is for you. Prepare to be annoyed, though. The game has a few bugs (ok. new bugs that weren't in the earlier version, so that's a feature for the old-timers) and a cheap feel to it, but as a managing game of hockey made in the UK - it's pretty ok. Worth your money, but hopefully offers a lot more in the future.			",37,15,0,11,20,2,19

								Before I start the review itself, let me start by saying that I'm part of the potentially big group that started liking ice hockey on their youth due to the Mighty Ducks trilogy. Yes, I'm one of those. And yes, you can imagine which team I'm playing with right now, the Mighty Ducks.That said, here goes the review.GameplayThere's not much to say, considering it's a management game. Being from a well known developer, mostly known for the Football Manager (FM) series, you can expect to find some FM similarities. Any ice hockey fan, with an interest for managament games, will enjoy the game and will most certainly spend hundreds of hours playing it.The gameplay is just you'd expect from a managament game, allowing you to set tactics, practice, and take care of the team's transactions. You'll also be able to lose yourself with all the statistics avaiable, trying to find that change that will allow you to tweak your tactic. But don't think for a second you can just grab all the big guns and ram your way through! You can also scout for prospects and develop them, so you can later use them to win the cup, or just use them as a bargaining chip.It's your game, your team, your choice. Until you get fired.Pros Plenty details; Good trading and contract system, considering the AI doesn't scam you, or lets you scam them; Quick booting and load/save system; Has a nice number of leagues, and hopefully more will be added soon; The match engine is quite good, and entertaining, with a few minor problems (see cons section); Good tactical interface, with a lot of options that can make or break your streak.Considering it's Early Access, and they're open to suggestions, and also considering by the end of its EA state will be most likely be as polished as the FM series appears to be, I'll reduce my cons to what I've found in the actual game so far.Cons Sometimes the players flip out a bit on the 2D engine, and either just stop for a couple second, or during penalties and faceoffs they just ram into each other until they find a way to go to their spot, so the play can start; UI could be a tad bit better, as somethings are harder to find;  To withdraw an offer after all the parties have accepted you've to right click the player's name and manually withdraw it, as there's no ""Cancel"" option on the news screen, just a confirm option.VerdictI'd give it a 9/10 considering it's EA status and the series long hiatus. Tons of potential.If I'm not mistaken, they don't have the licenses yet, but you can easily get a ""fan made"" database to ""fix"" that. ",195,74,5,28,41,1,22

								Like many Early access games, people tend to use the word ""potential.""   EHM EA is no different.    The difference with using the word here is that this is a reputatble company, with a development team that has a huge passion for hockey.  There are some advancements from EHM 2007 but it still is very close to the same game currently in terms of features.    The AI is improved, the regen system has changed and development seems better so far.   All the old bugs are fixed, I have yet to come across any new bugs and the stats so far seem more realistic than 07.Although the more I think about it the more I'm saddened that SI wouldn't commit fully, It's better than nothing.   It's finally back (sort of) and hopefully will stay for a long time!   Thanks Riz!EDIT:   Expect the game to crash.  Again it is WIP, so far the first season in each of my games works just fine but after that it can be hit and miss.   I'm sure will be patched rather quickly.READER BEWARE:  Most of us have waited 8 years for this moment.			",5,1,0,1,4,0,2

								In a lot of ways EHM:EA is just an updated version of EHM 2007, same layout and design, but with better coding to improve the game in many areas. After downloading the newest roster update from TBL, it feels almost as if I picked up right where I left off last time I played EHM 2007. However, for new players the game still has a very difficult learning curve. More detailed explanations of game features, statistics, etc would go a long way to helping more players understand and enjoy the game.			",37,4,0,5,6,0,14

												What I love about manager games is to take a small team and build it up to greatness. Sadly, that's not possible in EHM - if you don't own your arena (small teams won't) you can't expand it and you can't build one and thus you can't build up an income. Some teams will even start with 0 ticket price, so you'll never get money from home games (which means you'll never have any money - you won't go bancrupt, just no possibility to invest or pay salaries).There are also bugs and a distinct lack of customization - hopping between different info screens because if you combine them you get 2/3rds of the info you want. Graphics and sound is poor, not that it matters to a manager game but it feels really outdated.I wish this had been in early access still, because then there would have been a decent chance of some of those issues being fixed. Right now I fear that the game was released and abandoned.			",19,10,0,21,27,0,25

								I love this game. I started playing championship manager in the 95-96 seson. Played it like crazy as a teenager and bought every version of the game untill FM 2014. Now i am old,fat lawyer who can play a few hours each week.... I started playing eastside in 2004 and bought all three versions of the game and playd ehm 2007 untill this game come out.The tactic and long term planning of the managementgame of Eastside hockey manager is very damanding,fun and challanging. This version is an updated version of the 2007 game and is very very complete with tons of functions,options and challanges.When u start a new game just have fun and learn the game. For players who played FM or Eastside before i recomend human managers to impose some restrictions on trading. Trading over and over again will result in a super team to fast.There is an old fansite up and running for easside called blueline who have living forum,updates,roosterpacks and graphics. The community there is very helpful mature and social.A price for this product under 40€ is a must buy. I got hundreds and hundreds of play hours from my game.			",4,6,1,12,8,2,12

								This game is must-have for any hockey fan, hardcore or not. This version of Eastside Hockey Manager is a lot like 2007, just improved drastically. One of the most notable improvements is of the interface. It's a lot cleaner and easier to navigate. The ""Game View"" option is also nice. It's fun to be able to follow the game as it goes and make changes as needed.I recommend that you download the roster, logo and player picture updates from TBL. It makes the game more fun to be able to play with real players and teams, rather than made up ones.As noted by other reviewers, the one thing that should be improved is the tutorials. For people that have never played the game before, it might be tough for them to pick-up the game and play.			",90,13,9,6,21,1,7

								After an 8-year hiatus, EHM makes its return via early access and while the game is very similar to its most recent iteration, that does not hinder or ruin the experience in any way.  As an early access game, this is a very polished and solid initial effort.For those who haven't played EHM, the game is a text management sim where you take complete control of a team and attempt to use your skills as a general manager to take your team to glory.  As the game is in early access mode, there are no official licenses or real players.  However, www.ehmtheblueline.com has a very nice roster set, logos, and real team and competition names that provide that.  Unlike NHL by EA Sports, you are the General Manager and do not control the players during games.  You sign free agents, hire coaches, scouts, and of course, trade as you desire.  Additionally, you can set your lines, practices, and tactics.  You also can promote and demote players between minor leagues and choose how to build your team.  As you're unable to control your players directly, tactics are very important in helping you win games.  The games themselves can be viewed via 2d mode where the players appear as dots with the puck, similar to the initial offerings of Football Manager 8 years ago, before it went 3D.  The game engine is solid and provides a decent way to watch games and observe your players.  The minor gripe I do have with the game engine is that it does look dated especially compared with how SI has evolved its Football Manager franchise.  Having said that, the fact that this game was developed as a side project by SI mitigates that gripe somewhat.The menus are cleaner than EHM 2007 although again, not as intuitive as the newest Football Manager games.  The other issue is that the game can only be run in one resolution which means that newer screen owners will not be able to view the game on a full screen.  Hopefully, that will be addressed in a future update.If you love Football Manager, Out of the Park Baseball, and text sims, you owe yourself the privilege in checking this game out.  For $14,99, you simply can't go wrong.  The more people that purchase this game, the more likely we will see official licenses and future releases.  If you're an armchair hockey fan who thinks, sleeps, and drinks hockey, you definitely need to check this out.  Disappointed that your team continues to build around a questionable core?  Fix it yourself in EHM.  You won't regret it!			",6,3,1,5,6,0,12

								The game gets quite easy after a while if you test different tactics, but its pretty addictive and theres a lot of content.Its realistic, but I would personally like to have retained salary in trades and the cap going up over the years (it always stays at 71 mil). Also, sometimes owners and fans will be angry after trades that you think were big steal (for example when I traded Tootoo Ryder and a 2nd for Ladd).Overall I would give it about a 8/10.

								Eastside Hockey Manager offers some improvements from its 2007 version. There are still a few ways to go in terms of tweaking and improving the database, but the game is quite good, generally speaking.Pros:+ graphical revamp of the game makes it more pleasant to the eye+ improved realism and AI+ Scout Report offers a vast amount of information on players, very good tool for player analysis+ compatibility with 2007 tactics, graphics and databasesCons:- still some database issues to fix (AHL teams appearing as NHL teams in the players' history screen or no updated Hall of Fame/NHL player records)- same 1024x768 resolution problem for fullscreen and/or windowed mode- some options could be more user friendly in terms of accessing them (for example, the minor league affiliates)			",74,13,4,29,14,4,14

												I have just returned to EHM recently because there was so much I missed when I tried to play That Other Hockey Manager. For example, I miss watching the pixel circles run around the ice surface, so I could actually see at least somewhat what my players were doing on ice, and get a sense of personality from them that you just can't get from repetitive text. I missed a tactics layer that made sense and was easy to use (which EHM has), and a trade system that made sense, and an interactive scouting system that made sense, and all the great rosters the guys at the Blue Line keep making. I just missed all that. It took me a while to figure out a hotfix of my own to get the game running on Windows 10, which is frustrating (I love Steam, I do, but why can't you guys be more like GOG and make the games playable before you sell them to me)... but once I did, I fell in love all over again.EHM is a game I have played almost more than anything...more than Civ 4 and 5, more than XCom... EHM put me to sleep at night, head nodding over my little laptop in years gone by, because I just couldn't stop until little hours of the morning... and it still gets me that way. I lost a whole morning with the Canucks today trying to decide if the McCann/Virtanen gamble was worth it, or if I should send them back to juniors.... and watching Vrbata miss shot after shot...it was just like real-life Canucks hockey!So here's to you, EHM, and your amazing creator. I suspect, by the quietness of the updates, that EHM on Steam may not have a long, vibrant life full of changes and improvements (I'm looking at you, more on-ice graphics, because I remember Wayne Gretzky Hockey 2 and 3), like that Other Simulator is getting, but until That Other Simulator figures out how to show on-ice play, and simplifies and streamlines tactics and lines and coaching, I'll be keeping this on my computer and playing it until I fall asleep at the keyboard.

								I'm having an amazing amount of fun playing this game!  There are a few minor things I'm waiting for them to implement, such as salary retention on trades, but mostly this feels like a finished product to me.  I will say though that I hope they put a lot of work into trade realism before the full launch.  It's ok as it is, but could definitely be improved.  The other main thing that I'm hoping gets fixed soon is the swarm of good players making it to free agency.  Way too many.  But overall, this game is so good that I just cannot stop playing it!  I wholeheartedly recommend it to any hockey fan!			",163,46,8,56,39,4,23

												This is a must have for any hockey fan and a stat freak. Just use the community stuff and enjoy real players, teams, leagues and so on. The implementation is really easy and since I started to play again, since I am a EHM 2007 veteran; I don't eat, don't work, lost my girlfriend haven't slept.. but won the championship. Because it's the cup. One of the minuses though would be the difference between the EHM 2007 and this one is almost none. For me it doesn't matter much, cause I enjoyed it before. But still.Too bad I don't have much time to play it			",213,27,9,23,14,0,27

								It's been such a long time since this title had a major revolution, and it's finally here, a much needed retool of this much loved product. i have only just downloaded it and gave it a whirl, but it has a feel of what should have been done to begin with, or should i say it's what it needed back on 2006 when they released it pre version.I will say, it's still kinda sluggish on loading, and very work in progress feel to it, however i do appreciate it's a pre release and much has yet to be done to it. i also would like to see some new features on the staffing side, more participation by the board with trades, such as more pressure to get players, and more negotiations with board with the financial side, such as how much a player is worth in trades. i feel also scouting should be harder, and be far more specific to what your search requires, such as takes longer, and a better stat wise scout will get ""much"" better results. head coaches should be able to reject trades, and also suggest trades with other teams on the home page. for example ""head coach"" likes a ""certain player"" on a particular team, and we should maybe go on an offer for him.i do feel however it has much potential, and there is alot of excitement on this release and i can see it being very populer with hockey fans.

												You probably already know if you want EHM or not. If you aren't a hockey fan, and if you don't like pretty deep simulation-based games, there's nothing for you here.However, if you like those two things, EHM isn't perfect, but it is the best option in the genre. Sports Interactive know what they're doing, and EHM is no different, although it is a little barebones. It's a shame that, for what is ostensibly a new game, there's no modern features such as achievements. Thankfully it does have Workshop support, and it's here we see EHM's trump card.EHM's modding community is what, for me, pushes the game from standard sports-sim to something engrossing. Real-world rosters and clubs, as well as facepacks, allow for something more realistic - and thus, fun. For me, trying to turn my beloved Calgary Flames from perennial bottom-feeders into an actual force is far more enjoyable than doing it with a fantasy club, with fake players. Without these mods, EHM is pretty sparse.On its own, EHM is a tough sell. Even with it's fantastic mod support, it caters to a pretty small niche. If that niche includes you, though, you'll be treated to a game that demands time and patience, but yields great reward.			",317,99,15,27,38,4,43

												tl;dr - still plays like Early Access; minimally supportedYes, I got my money's worth. Yes I was enjoying it. At this point, it is on the shelf until improved. I would love to play more but will not. The reasons are below.A very flexible game that let's you be the General Manager for a team at almost any level of hockey. You manage coaching staff, scouts, players and contracts. You can coach at a very detailed level or leave those details to the AI. Many features will let you play your way.Even though the game has a lengthy manual, much of how it works it not explained. This is one of those games that you need to figure out and google. You will learn about hockey and how it works. You will learn about how hockey works and how this game is different.I learned the game and the many options. While I found it acceptable, I also find it falls short in some important design areas.For example, here[community.sigames.com] is a long list of possible enhancements for the latest version 1.1. You can see in this discussion that the developer is not aligned with the reality of their game (regarding salary cap). This shows a lack of thorough design.When I first bought the game at version 1.0.2, it would frequently lock up. There was a work-around where you could ""go on vacation"" to get past the day with the error but you were then missing the simulation for that day. This error was fixed in 1.1.1, more than two months after release. This error was related to simulating many leagues when you play and again shows a lack of thorough design.What finally made me put it on the shelf is that after being fired from my favorite team and working 7 game years and more than 300 actual hours to return to that team, it is not possible to GM the team because my old history is not reset upon re-hire. This means the team has no tolerance for my presence and is a hair away from firing me as soon as I start the job. Again, something that seems like a lack of thorough design.So even though it is version 1.1, I would label it 0.8 or 0.9. It's close but not yet ready for long term playability.edit: I've noticed that they only tend to support the game for about a week after a release. There is a release about once a quarter so there's not much support. Here is an example.[community.sigames.com]If you do end up buying the game, save often, it still locks up pretty frequently.

												*** UPDATED REVIEW FROM EARLY ACCESS ***It's gotten much better since Early Access.The reason why I love this simulator is because it's constantly being updated, and it also has a Workshop hub which isn't even something I originally predicted this game having. The fact that they're doing literally everything they can to incorporate as many fixes; features, and updates with rosters, teams, and even more proves that this game will be timeless for quite some time.But again, it is only a simulator so if you want the real hockey video gaming experience sadly you got to shell out the money for a PS4 and copies of EA Sports NHL every year. Every bug I've ever seen has been patched quickly, every feature I've wanted besides a few have been already put into this game. Besides no means of easily adjusting Salary Cap, Rosters, and Attributes between Playing and Non Playing staff this game has basically everything needed for a proper hockey sim. It's expanding to more and more leagues, and they even update the rosters regularly.It's nice to see a game having such support for such a small fanbase, even the Workshop has all the facepacks you could ever need. So far it's kind of a slow start out of early access, but this simulator has limitless potential in the long run.Graphics: 10/10Everything is aesthetically pleasing and as cohesive as it needs to be, with the Workshop addon it's easy to get the team logos you want without much fuss. I've ultimately no complaints with the GUI, as everything works as intended and should.Engine: 9.5/10The speeds are as fast as they've ever been with as good looking of a GUI as you can get, completely optimal in every way. Injuries for some reason seem more reasonable, but still far too common. There must be an option to either increase or reduce chance of injuries, because I feel for the entire NHL league they are FAR too common.Customizability: 6.5/10The game is fairly basic even now, as I previously mentioned in my Early Access review there's no real way to edit the leagues completely. I'd love to be able to add, edit, and delete teams from leagues just to experiment around with them. Usually simulators like this will have a sandbox-ish feel, but I feel fairly limited to original concepts which doesn't really have a ""refreshing"" effect if you think about it. It'd be nice to at least edit rosters, and staff however - you can import EHM 2007 databases which you can edit at your own will but to be frank that's quite a bit of a hassle. Some more open modding support would be awesome as well, or at least - more settings to tweak. Few more complaints is there's no way to edit rosters, staff, salary caps, etc... It feels less like a ""Manager"" more like just a ""Be A GM."" This isn't to say the simulator isn't accurate and doesn't meet it's intended purpose, but Simulator and Sandbox are something that go hand-in-hand. Especially when you're trying to make things interesting, and have fun with different ideas. I raised this to a 6.5 from a 6, because a lot of the bugs preventing personnel customization and hiring were fixed (like hiring physio's + scouts from players.)Interface: 10/10Though the resolutions you can use do not have the ability to be custom, there are new selectable resolutions! Basically all the standard resolutions, but it's so nice being able to just play 720p on my third monitor. The GUI is quickly responsive, and very intuitive. Easy to learn after a few clicks around, and nice to look at. I use the minimal GUI without pictures, background images, and news images to speed up the sims a little. Still looks great, and runs very smoothly.Functionality: 10/10Although some of the resident errors still pop up every once in a blue moon, there are no crashes I've found yet. You can usually just mash right through the errors and the game will still continue to no fault, it's a rare a game can just work through errors so I have to say these devs did a spectacular job with this simulator.Sound: ?/?Sound isn't a necessary or objective need in a simulator game, by any means and will not be counted towards the score.Overall: 9.2The workshop support is astounding, hopefully some people will make some addons relating to being able to edit rosters; salary caps, etc... very easily. Being hoinest this will probably be the closest I ever give a review to any game being this close to it's objective ""Perfect 10."" The support is awesome, rosters are residually updated and tweaked. Bugs are fixed commonly, and so far the game lives up to expectations and standards and even exceeds. Being honest I can only imagine this game getting better and better with time. It's not common that a game will have the ability to be timeless, but a simulator like this probably could being given the right amount of ""Tender Loving Care"" or ""TLC"" as it ages.tl;dr: This STILL was totally worth the $15 I spent on it, in short.

								I'm a huge FM and hockey fan so I'm amazed I've only found out about this series today of all days.  I've only played a few hours but so far I'm liking it.  It's got a lot of promise and has some really good elements from the FM games.  The screens are easy to navigate and the stats are easy to find and read.If you buy this game make sure to download updated rosters from The Blue Line as this is not a licensed game (yet).  You might also want to download graphics and face packs to enhance your experience.As Early Access games go this is shaping up very nicely so far and I am more than happy to support this franchise.  Hopefully development continues and we get some really cool things implemented.  There are already buzzing forums containing wishlists for the game so I'm really looking forward to what the future holds.TLDR: If you are a sports fan/hockey fan and also like Football Manager you will love this game.

												This is the best game ever! I remember playing this as a kid back in the day. When I saw it was coming back just over a year I go I was excited to be back at it.There are several things that could make this game even better:1. Better player interaction - team meetings and 121 talks with players would be a bonus.2. Better contract negotiations.3. Being able to arrange friendly international games.4. Being able to hold training camps for lesser teams (  the elite league doesn't allow them but I know the teams have them prior to the start of the season ).5. Forming new affiliated teams.On a whole this game can take hours of your life it has with mine and it will for many, many, many more hours. I recommend this game to every hardcore hockey fan, and anyone who would like to get into the sport.The league coverage is huge especially in the British league. We aren't the most skillful league but they have the top 6 leagues in the country all playable.With just a few tweets and this game could easily take over my life! ",16,5,2,5,28,0,4

								This.I've been waiting for this for eight years, as many of you have. I've racked up hundreds of hours getting teams of young guns to reach the mightiest of prizes, the Great Lord Stanley's Grail. Countless nights of sleep were sacrificed when came the real season: so many sodas... so many chips (crisps, for our friends in the UK). Bathroom breaks were (unwisely) postponed when my Habs played the Bruins (almost systematically) in legendary first-round skirmishes. Meals were skipped. Assignments were botched. Life, however, uh, found a way.And now, thanks to the dedication of the people at SI, I can rejoice (at long last) the return of the Prodigal Son.I've only played a few hours thus far, but I am ecstatic! This is no beta test, this is a very polished, very stable game and it delivers. Plus, with the help of the just-as-dedicated people of TBL, there is a fresh, up-to-date roster pack waiting for you to be savoured. I don't think I could thank them enough for their generosity for the past eight years, nor would my words amount to their work. I will say that the resolution (fixed 1024x768) is my main irritant, but it is in NO way a major source of irritation; it is merely an attempt at searching for a ""con"" amidst a very impressive number of ""pros"".You're a hockey fan? Get this. Now. 16,99$ (yeah yeah, the Canadian dollar took a drop) is ridiculously low for an early access of this quality.			",16,7,0,9,9,0,11

												Not an incredible sim, but a damn good one. With Workshop mods you can effectively create the NHL and all other relevant leagues with some minor differences (No salary cap inflation and arbitration) but you still have access to all the things that make strategy relevant in sports (Salary cap, personnel, trading, free agents and practice schedule). This game leaves you surprisingly free to do what you want, from managing/coaching your team and it's farm affiliate to simply being the general manager of a team and letting your coach handle the strategy and game day line-up. After 3 years the game runs out of prospects in the draft and does use randomnly generated players, but this is unavoidable and does not hamper the games quality. The learning curve can be a little steep but after a hour or two I caught on quickly. I highly reccomend this game to hockey fans especially and sports sim fans in general.			",90,6,4,6,10,2,7

								It's good to see that a franchise is back after pretty long time , haven't played much yet , but can easily say it's an addictive hockey game . Its Not Like EA Sports NHL "" Be a GM "" where you pretty much just jump in the game and play , Eastside Hockey Manager requires learning your players (Attributes , Positions etc. ) and there's no such thing as ""Overall"" where you can easily understand which player is best or worst .  If someone finds no teams logos or players photos a problem , you can visit ehmtheblueline.com , where you can download latest rosters and logos. ( You Have To Register For Some Extra Content ) Only problem I had was that 1024 x 768 is only resolution avaivable.Its early access so far but we must admit its pretty good game with a low price.

												Good game to waste a lot of hours on.It's a bit tough getting into it and finding everything, but once you get to that point, it feels easy. Transfers are a bit unrealistic at times and sometimes it feels a bit too easy to win the league. But all in all a great hockey (GM) manager game.Remember to download the addons though! :-)			",8,0,0,3,3,0,1

Early Access Review
								I don't usually write reviews, but this game is already so good and still has such great potential, coming from a die hard hockey fan, I love this game. Pros:Scouting - Scouting mission details can be changed like player age, position, or ignore well known players/prospects, and it really helps you find the players you need, whether you're playing as Arizona stocking up on talent, or Detroit looking for a diamond in the rough, or Montreal and you are looking for some proven foreign skill to boulster your roster for the cup run, you can find the players you need. You can also generalize the scouting by assigning a scout to a continent, or country/nation, or you can assign him to individual leagues, you can even assign a scout to a particular player if you'd like.Game simulation- You can choose to simply speed up games to get it over with, or you can watch the game real time and make tactical changes, line changes, etc. Line Changes/team tactics/unit tactics/player tactics- Wow. Just great. You can change defensive zone strategies, neutral zone defensive strategies/positioning, neutral zone offensive strategies/positioning, forecheck, breakout strategies, offensive zone strategies, and of course special team units like PP and PK. You can choose which player is le playmaker of the line, choose who takes faceoffs (which is great I'll explain further in), etc you have absolute control of your lines. You can also change individual tactics, so if you have two offensive players and a power forward on your first line, you can change the line to not body check often or hard, and not be aggressive, then go to your power forward individually and make him check hard, play aggressively and with a high tempo to balance out your line, or set a defensive type of player to shadow an opposing player and keep him in check.You also have control over practice so you can train what coaches do what (coaches have attributes like coaching defensive players at 17/20, but then he might have 11/20 for coaching forwards and a poor goalie stat as well, so make him only handle defeinsive training. I believe it helps, clarification would be nice though. You can make certain player focus on an area of the game that maybe he is weak at, or boost what he's good at even more. You can have signing bonuses for games played, points, shut outs, etc.Those are a few things that stuck out that I likedCons:Now, I know you want it to be hardcore simulation, very in depth etc. But damn, it takes a looooong time to get through seasons. I want to go outside and do♥♥♥♥♥♥still, and have a life. I like it being in depth. Although I have quite a bit of time played, I find it extremely hard to get in to when it takes me like six hours or sometimes longer to finish the season. Just make an option to set a date a date simulate up to it. I know that's like EA NHL's simulaion, but it does work good. Or at least a quick sim game option. I know it might ""dumb the game down"" but the players that don't want it don't have to use it. Not everyone has time to play for six hours, although it's so good I have played for even longer in one session before. It may also interfere with game longevity, so I guess it's a choice the devs need to make. I really hope that isn't an option already that I haven't found lmao.Player Overall and progression- (My only semi-major gripe about something wrong/broken with the game, not having quick sim is not wrong/broken, it's just not included)This is pretty simple to understand why it must change slightly... I will have great prospects for the future, but they are young and only really strong in the physical category on the far right like speed, strenghth etc. and since they are so strong in that category, they have a four star ""current rating"" so if he's playing in the AHL he will be unhappy because he's rated four stars, but then I call him up, and he's a complete liability on the ice, and he does poorly in the big league, and his potential may drop or he may not grow properly. The worst part is, if you don't call them up they will get unhappy and eventually request a trade and in some cases not resign a contract so you just lost out on a valuable draft pick simply because he was being a cocky bigot (imporper use of bigot ik) that thought he was the♥♥♥♥♥♥ then his hopes got crushed and blames it on me. If there's a way to fix this, I'd love some clarification, maybe I'm the only one with the problem. That being said, the rookies are in no way broken lol, this happened in a few particular cases. but maybe make it so that certain statistics count more towards your current rating and others less, physical category should have the ""least say"" in the current rating. Also, maybe have an overall stat or at least break up the stats into better catagories like defensive, offensive, physical, it is sort of like that but then teamwork is in defense (could be in both but offense makes more sense IMO) and stick checking and positioning is in offense so it's a bit odd when figuring out what type of player a player is. I don't really like the player type system either and how it changes. I draft a rookie and he is a playmaking offensive forward for 2 years, then he grew one year and he turned into a two-way. Maybe have a current player role and projected player role like what sort of player he will be at his peak (which you can alter using the practice system), and not just a comparison to an NHL player. I saw you did so in the most recent update, although I think the player/prospect progression could use some more tweaking. Although I have decent time played, I'm still learning so if I have gotten anything wrong I'd love an explanation on how a few mechanics work:) and I know it's early access so it's not fully complete, but it's already a great, complete game in my book. I recommend this 100% to anyone thinking about purchasing. My Vancouver Canucks did great in regular season, and got swept in the first round by a division rival. 8/8 realism. Love the game, looking forward to updates. Would continue to play even if you didn't update.:) Sorry for the long review. P.S. I'd rather spend 60$ on this rather then the 60$ I spent on NHL 15 on ""Next-Gen"" (lol) consoles.			",3,2,0,3,4,0,4

												Tips for a fun game:- Limit yourself to one (or even zero) UFA acquisitions per year. This is a very easy way to beat the game- Hide player attributes and read scout reports instead- Dish out realistic contract offersThe game is a lot of fun if you try and keep things realistic. High recommended.			",39,13,3,9,2,0,6

												My first management game. I did try GM mode in EA NHL but it was frustrating and lacking in depth. This game has TONS of depth. More than you will probably use but it's there anyways. You can add in custom rosters and with tools, add and modify players. Multiplayer has just been added but I'm looking forward to it and I think it will add another dimension to the game.

Early Access Review
								Gotta say, I wasn't expecting this much from this game:It's an incredibly detailed Hockey simulator that says ""Early Access"" but besides some UI changes that could be made, looks like it could be a full-blown game right now. It's a game that is easy to lose yourself in and you know you want to come back to play it once you've shut it down. Even though right now the game doesn't have actual NHL rosters in, it is incredibly easily to download the real rosters and facepacks to go along with it. The Blueline website does a better job than EA has ever done on their NHL games at updating their rosters; you can expect an updated roster almost once a week during the regular season from the website. There are a couple of problems with the game right now, obviously. The trading in the game doesn't work very well. You never see a blockbuster trade in the game and teams are constantly sending good players that are underperforming through the waivers. On my simulation Dion Phaneuf had a 50 point season but when I put him on the block, the best trade offer I can expect is a couple of 3rd or 4th round draft picks. This could be because of his salary, but I still think the game's trading mechanics need to be a little reworked.If you are looking for an extremely detailed GM simulator than Eastside Hockey Manager is the game to get. Don't let the ""Early Access"" deceive you, this is a game that is easy to waste hours on and is challenging and rewarding. Recommended to anyone that loves hockey and wants to know what goes on behind the scenes!			",38,3,0,5,11,0,2

								If you like the Be a Gm mode in the NHL games, you will be sucked into this. very addicting and in-depth game. I normally don't support early access games due to the fact majority never get completed, this is a developer I trust will make this great game even better if they see the support for it is there. For hockey fans I highly reccomend it, reccomend to anyone but very much so for hockey fans.			",88,19,3,12,17,0,9

								I've been playing EHM for over 10 years starting with the original EHM before buying EHM 2005 and EHM 2007.  I've probably logged well over 2000 hours between database editing, participating in challenges over on EHM the Blue Line as well as enjoying it on my laptop as a welcome distraction on long flights.The game's core has not changed and believe me when I say that this truly is a good thing.  What has changed are numerous improvements including an interface that makes navigation easier, international tournaments are far more realistic and the game AI seems to have finally become more lifelike.If you're a hockey fan and you like sims, don't hesitate to invest in this.  Just remember to brush your teeth.			",1145,450,18,135,158,4,193

								It's kinda hard to put a rate on this game. First of all i want to thank SI for doing this, we really need a new Hockey Manager game. But when i started playing this Early Access it just feels like a new skin for EHM 2007. No big new featuers, and my expectations that many of the functions from Football Manager would be included in this game was wrong. And that makes me really worried. Because atm i feel that there is no need for me to stop playing a updated version of 2007 if there isnt any big difference between the games.I know that this is a early access game so many thing can happen along the way. But the lack of new functions makes me worried for the future. But i will still support this development. But i hope that you are doing it 100% SI and not only a fast rework of a old game.

								Under the hood, there have been some major changes to the game. It's still a work in progress, but it is already an improvement over EHM 2007. Once things have been tweaked further, I think it will be a big improvement over EHM 2007. It already makes a difference having customisable start dates (great for retro rosters) and having up-to-date rules and league structures. The player progression and attribute modelling has been overhauled - and the introduction of Player Roles will lead to better database updates, in my view.Visually the game has undergone a bit of a facelift. It's not a complete overhaul, but a nice improvement and will be familiar to anybody who has played the EHM 2007. This has made the UI more spacious but it would be nice to see support for wider/higher resolutions in the future.The game ships with a fictional database and no logos. However, this is easily solved by downloading community-created content - most of which is hosted on www.ehmtheblueline.com ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of those niche games that most gamers probably wouldn't like but a certain demographic will obsess on. If you're a NHL or hockey fan. If you've ever played fantasy hockey. If you obsess on your favorite team and what would make it better. If you ever wanted to blow up an eternal loser like my Canucks (:sadface:) and rebuild the way you'd want to see it. This game is for you.I've probably played this game more than all other games combined in my life. I've spent literally tens of thousands of hours on this game since it's inital release in 2004 and it honestly hasn't changed much since then. There's been some tweaks here and there in the game's 13+ year history but it's still essentially the same text based sports management sim now that it was then. As someone who loves sports sims and I've played most of then, NHL Eastside is the absolute best and deepest one I've ever played. You control every aspect of the playing side of the game. Transactions, waivers, minor teams, drafts, personnel, strategies, contracts, scouting and free agent signings. The most engrossing thing for me has always been developing young players and working them into your system. Under your guidance players like Connor McDavid, Patrik Laine, Auston Matthews and other prospects can either flourish or flounder in your system.I'm not sure if casual fans will enjoy it. But if you're a hardcore hockey, sports strategy/sports management games fan EHM is a peak experience. Even today 13 years later, I still get the urge and thrill of spending an evening obsessing on this game fairly often.  ",4,0,0,0,2,0,0

												Lots of free updates and improvements since release. I never played the original version but it appears that they have managed to resurrect an old game by making some great changes. Workshop integreation and a strong community makes this a steal at 9.99 if you like sports management games. Sure the interface isn't as slick as the other hockey sim game on the market, but it works and is intuitive.It's not as deep as Football Manager but it's pretty darn close. Highly recommended.
