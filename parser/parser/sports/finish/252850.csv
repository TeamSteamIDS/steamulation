								It's like Pacman but with parkour and instead of ghosts you're trying to punch other pacmans to death.  The movement system is fun but the game beyond that feels kind of weird and it's not clear how much anything you do matters.  Getting killed puts you into this quasi-ghost state where you can sort of interfere with other players and have a 'tag' objective of a certain player to hunt down to earn points.  But the ghost objective doesn't really feel very satisfying and I think there's room to improve on this concept- it's just not good right now.  But it could be better.The 'stream interaction' aspects are a mediocre gimmick at best for 99% of the playerbase, only really being interesting for people who have thousands of viewers at any given time on Twitch.  While it's a cute idea, it basically means there's no way to actually play the game as intended unless you're big on Twitch.With some more work this could be a fun game, but right now it's clumsy and hard to understand on top of being very limited unless you're a big-time streamer.  I enjoy the base gameplay but it's not worth spending money on yet, and I hope it improves in the future.			",239,54,4,27,13,3,35

								I initially got into this game because I thought, ""Hey free trip to Twitch Con if I can be good at this game."" Pro tip: Don't expect to win or be good the first time you pick up the game and definitely don't have your first game be in the comp itself, lol. However, that's not to say you won't shine when you log in the first time. Anyway, after suffering a shameful defeat, I was still drawn back to the game. I met players through the Proletariat discord and we ended up playing a lot together. After playing this game for about two months, I've made so many friends and met so many amazing people, including the amazing Proletariat team. This isn't just a game. This is a community full of such diversity and awesomeness. You'll always have someone to play with and you'll always be welcome on in. After their newest release and listening to some of the ideas thrown around, there's no stopping the progression of this game and there will always be something for everyone. As a note of their customer support? Outstanding. They're always willing to help and make sure you're able to get back to gaming asap. Even if it's late at night and they might not be around, if you pop into discord, there's almost always someone awake who may be able to help you out. <3			",80,57,1,6,6,1,7

								This is a really fun game, especially with friends. I have been able to play quite a few rounds on stream, but also just joining a game in chat and alternating what is happening during the matches is great. You can bet on your favourite player, win points and use that to alternate the matches by adding things like ""the floor is lava"" and more extras. Controls are really easy to get to used to, and you can play this both by using a controller or a mouse and keyboard. The addition of character customisation by getting packs builds up anticipation and adds to the personisation of your game. More stuff is being added, so I am sure this will be a game to play for a long time.			",90,42,1,18,15,1,24

								“Quite frankly, because we’re trying something that’s never really been done before. While there have been a few games with Twitch-interactivity built in, Streamline was built from the ground-up with Broadcasters and their audiences in mind. We’re trying to make real-time interaction between the Broadcaster, their players, and their.."" and on and on it goes, the sales pitch for streammote.tv. This game, in short, is just a way for them to sell a service to developers thinking streamers need more ways to connect with their audiences.Now, unfortunately for them, Lumberyard (free Cryengine 3 developed by Amazon) does this and more, ohh and BETTER. Holy crap, log into twitch to then get forced to log into their website to then force everyone who even remotely wants to play with you to do the same then hand them all streammote links to your channel to join the party because steamworks and all other easy stuff is for plebs.If you want to make a game to sell a damn website that just restreams twitch, you could have easily gone with a much more easy solution for the user. I can't see anyone bothering to put up with all the crap you need to go through to just make a party. Then face the ""Oops, not enough people to start playing the game!"".Free game or not, it's lazy, it's definitely not innovative in the slightest considering that other streamer-bait scare game did the same thing. Ofcourse, at the time of writing this game was free, when you read this it will probably be worth 20 euros or however much.For anyone interested, amazon just burried these guys before their game was even known. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/releasenotes/lumberyard-v1.6.html#lumberyard-v1.6-highlights-metastream-gem ontop of the ability to basically whisper game invites on twitch and a bunch of other goodies. ( http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/chatplay-joinin.html )Ohh how does the game play? I wouldn't know, spent a good 20 minutes spamming ""Log in with Twitch"" which 504'd, 502'd or straight up gave me a generic error. Then once we got in, had to spend however long to figure out how to party with people and by then nobody wanted to even bother with the game. You click on Party and game just goes all ""Hey, check out this website for more info"". Because it knows that if it straight up told you that you have to sign to yet another website to access some super basic feature after signing into twitch to just access the damn game is a very stupid move. And so you click it, and the steammote site launches, which is just dominated by people playing -what else- Streamline, with signs and stuff to contact them if you are a developer, sign up if you are a broadcaster or log in if you are one of the people who wants to play with someone else but won't really bring them money (kinda like an extra in a movie, no fanfare there).Options-wise, it has nothing. 4 Presets to chose from (Low to Ultra), limited resolutions, no vsync and generally pretty barebones. If I didn't know better and saw that options menu I'd think it was some basic unity game.Ohh and can I say, they somehow managed to make the character creation pathetic, feels like no effort was put into it at all. You get some Rockband tshirts, a Portal and TF2 outfit then like 3 or 4 of their own stuff. And it all looks pretty weak. You get to pick one of 3 smurky-as-♥♥♥♥ faces that you would want to punch in the street if you found one, some clothes that look pretty uninspired and one of few haircuts. Don't worry though, they already got the majority of that♥♥♥♥♥♥locked behind a shop system that probably wants you to log on twitter or something before you can unlock anything.Atleast I didn't need to log into any websites to exit the game. I was actually half expecting I would be asked/forced to. ""Ohh you want to exit the game? Ofcourse, just sign into twitter, facebook, twitch and +1 our social media! THEN you can exit"".Having said that, for a lot of people the game does not run, for others the game refuses to exit and will stay running in the background.			",338,50,9,73,51,2,104

								[Player review]My review of Streamline based on the experience of a player that does not stream.Streamline is in my opinion an incredibly fun and challenging game because it offers a different experience every time I play. This experience is formed and changed each time by the Players,Viewers and Rules which change every time I play.The movement in Streamline is easy to jump into but requires some practice to get down, don't be afraid to maybe lose a few matches while getting into the game. Once you get the movement in the game down however it opens the gate to play every match in a diffrent style. Be it avoiding the hunter by staying on map wide distance of him/her or challenging the hunter straight on and getting that satisfying ""Bear wrestler"" accolade at the end of the match by stunning the hunter throughout the game.The look of the game is very cartoony which bases on your prefrences can be either a pro or con.The ability to join and play with a streamer and his/her community can be enjoyable yet for some perhaps a bit scary.For those who enjoy meeting new people I encourage joining on going streams to chat and play together. For those who do not feel the need for community play there has recently been an update which added a ""Quick Play"" mode. This allowed for players to play without being forced into a new group of people, this mode even eliminated the dependency on streamers to host in order play the game.For streamers who have a smaller group of viewers getting a good feel of the game might feel a little bit challenging at first. However it is still possible to get the most out of Streamline.Streamers are for example able to open their game to both viewers and ""Quick play"" players, this makes it easier to gain a full party without having a big viewer base. ( The downside is that these players might not join the stream and will thus not join in on the betting and voting/buying rules.)Another way to gain more players is the publicly open discord from the developers ""Proletariat"". In the discord Streamers are able to advertise to and communitcate with player and other streamers, this often increases the players who are both active on streamote and in-game.A last option would be to join with multiple streamers in one hosted game, through using the (Streamote.tv/Hostofgame/via/secondstreamer). this way each streamer has their own streamote channel and viewers but the betting/voting/buying is shared.Thus yes, it might be hard at first but there are options provided to help you at it.Since there has been quite some changes and additions to the game I will not review this until further in developemnt.I hope this adressed some of the important aspects for players/streamers deciding to play and/or buy streamline.

								Runs smooth for an EA game. Multiplayer is deader than your grandma's grandma. The game expects you to know everything right off the bat when you launch it the first time. That means, no tutorial. Practice mode? You run in a map collecting points for nothing. No bots, no goal, nothing.  Don't ever get this game.			",11,2,0,0,2,0,1

								Game looks great and *can* be fun at times but unless you're a streamer who has thousands of followers the game is kind of dull, as just a regular player or a small time streamer nobody bets and the 'viewer interation' is really no better than just having the 'rule changes' on random, they always happen at periodic intervals and never felt like they had any real impact on the game. If you are interested in the game buy it have a play around for an hour or so, you will have played the whole game by that point and can decide whether or not you want to refund it. PS. No Oceanic servers for my Australian bretheren so keep that in mind.			",299,58,4,25,33,5,30

								***I'd like to mention upfront, plan on playing this game with a community to get any fun out of it, otherwise it's going to be a lonely experience.***So that's out of the way, it can take a bit to get your bearings and understand what's going on. Really after a match or two you'll quickly find out it's basically like a 3d Pacman where a bunch of players are trying to collect points, and one ""hunter"" is trying to eliminate them. But that's not quite the whole picture; the community portion involves players using an app/twitch to vote on rules on a game in progress. This is where the magic is! Mid-game you can expect floors to turn into ice or lava, weapons to turn into pool noodles, players to randomly explode on contact, just crazy #$#@!If you can get passed the initial confusion, this game can be a blast. Especially if you are tuned into twitch while playing and getting everyone's reaction to the action on screen. Totally worth it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Streamline is a fun multiplayer action game filled with parkour, sprinting, gathering points and hitting players.If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.What is happening in the game:You have to run around, being careful not to get hit by the player, currently holding the stop sign. While doing that, you have to gather as many points as possible to climb on the leaderboard. If you get hit by the player with the stop sign, you become the holder of the sign and you are not able to collect points until you manage to hit a player. While the chase is ongoing, random events also occur, an example of those is lava floor.Pros: Graphics | The game looks quite good. I really like that everything is bright and colourful, which is something that I miss in a lot of games. The game itself is quite fast-paced and a different colour scheme would probably confuse players if too many things would be going on at the same time. Animations such as jumping and wall running are also surprisingly well-made. Movement | As mentioned before, this game also includes wall-running, which is very fun to do. Wall-running in weird places usually also enables you to get much more points, which makes it an essential skill to be able to compete for the highest places on the leaderboard. You also have double jumping and trampolines. With those, you can jump really high and have a lot more fun. Character Customization | I was really surprised by the amount of character customization this game is offering. You can change almost everything: your shirt, your pants, your shoes, your face, your skin and so on. Most of the available items also have a number of different colours to choose from, which lets you create the perfect colour combination for you. Twitch Integration | Although integrating Twitch so deeply into the game also has a big downside which I will mention later in this review, I have to say that it also brings a lot of fun into this game. As one viewer sets up his stream, other players can join his party. Viewers of that person's stream can then bet on any player in the party they want using their in-game coins. They can also select an event, which will then occur in the game and influence all players. (Random) Events | As written above, viewers of one's stream can pick an event that will influence the game. If there aren't viewers or none of them choose to pick an event, an event is selected randomly every once in a while. Those events can really make the game much better. Let me list some of those events: Lava Floor (you must not touch the ground or your die), No Touching (if you touch another player, you die), Concrete Feet (you can't double jump), Continuous Jumping (you can't stop jumping) and a few more. I probably got a few names wrong, I apologise for that. Maps | There are currently 6 maps in Streamline, all of them are quite good. Some of them have more trampolines than others, some have much better wall-climbing. If you get to choose the map, there is certainly a map which is right for you. Pack Drops | After most matches, you will get a pack of items shaped like one of those bags you go to fitness with. The better you perform, the better are the chances of getting a pack of higher value. Each pack contains one or two things. You can either get a new item (most commonly a piece of clothing, a hairstyle or a pair of shoes) or, if you get two items, the second one can be a new colour for one of the items you already have. I really like that you get those packs so often because there are quite a lot of things to be unlocked. Achievements | There are 49 achievements in this game and they contribute a lot to the overall quality of this game. They are really fun to achieve as they actually reward you for something special you do, not for grinding something for a long time.Cons: Twitch Requirement | As much as Twitter integration can be fun, I find it weird that you can only play the game after logging in with Twitch and setting up some things first. I don't really have a desire to stream my gameplay and I'm also not really keen on being on someone else's stream. Developers are supposedly thinking of getting rid of this requirement, but as of now, it still exists in the game. Hit Detection | Sometimes, you get hit by players that are not really that close, but you still get hit. If you figure how to use this, it's very easy to kill other players, which is (in my opinion) giving an unfair advantage to some players. Connectivity Problems | When I try to start playing, I am sometimes not able to do so because of some server communication problems. The issue usually goes away in a few minutes and it's not really that often, but it's still worth mentioning. Resolution Issues | When I play in fullscreen mode, I can't see all of the menus properly. When I wanted to check the commands in the options menu, I had to switch to windowed mode, or some of the menu would be cut off for some reason. Pricing | Honestly, I'm not sure if $20 is the right price tag for this game. Sure, it has a lot of content and it's pretty fun, but for $20 you can get some much better games-The final verdict:The game is certainly very fun. Although it was lacking players a month ago, the influx of new players certainly gave this game a huge boost and now it's not ever a problem to find somebody to play with. The game looks awesome and plays awesome, which outweighs most of the negative things in this game.If you're looking for some fun multiplayer action, this is certainly the way to go. Although the price is a bit high, there's no reason not to get this for yourself when it's on discount.With love,BirdCuteNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review. ",1008,395,42,93,129,14,119

								You must have a Twitch account to start the game.  That's annoying, but whatever.  So I logged into Twitch.I then tried to play multiplayer and found out I also needed a Steamote account.  WTF is Steamote?  Okay... second account created just to attempt to play the game.I joined a match, which involved running around collecting gems while 1 player tried to spank me with a stop sign.  The gems provided me no benefit whatsoever.  There is no end goal, you just collect gems until the time runs out.  Whoever collected the most gems wins.  There are no power-ups for you to pickup and use, no real player interaction other than occasionally spanking people, and no real variety to the gameplay.  That's boring...So 3 strikes already and I haven't even attempted to play with friends yet.  Now I invite my buddy to join me and we attempt all kinds of things to get into a game together.  This process is so convoluted that the game isn't even worth playing.  With the game running, you have to [Alt]+[Tab] out of the game and access the Steamote website.  One player must then create a party and all other players need to go to the party's webpage in order to join the game.  Then (for private games) the host has to manually approve each person who attempts to join the party (the host cannot simply invite friends).  When you think you're done, [Alt]+[Tab] back into the game and discover that Steamote didn't actually work, so you have to repeat the invite process.  Maybe it works the second time, maybe it doesn't.  If not, you see if you can find some random other person's public game that has enough open slots for you and all your friends.  Finally, you can play the game.Then you remember the game is unbelievably boring and playing with friends doesn't make it any better.I played about a dozen matches on the various maps and with various player counts.  The game simply doesn't offer anything that makes it worth coming back to.			",262,95,7,15,27,2,18

								Opinion:**I love this game- when I found out about it this summer I was blown away that more people weren’t paying attention to it.  As a streamer on Twitch I am always looking for games that get the chat involved- many times the game I am playing has zero integration and occasionally it is nice to provide an experience that is all-inclusive for the viewers.  Here's the basic gameplay description:There is one game mode currently: Elimination which pits the “hunter” against the “runners” to gather the most points before getting eliminated! The parkour movement allows everyone to get around the level with ease: double jump, sprint, power slide, and dodge left/right. The hunter is the only one with a melee weapon and their goal is eliminate the runners- pretty simple! The hunter also recharges stamina over time where the runners are vulnerable with limited stamina (runners pick up lightning bolts to refill it). The hunter is normally the host of the game who is streaming on Twitch but you can also choose another person to be hunter or a random choice.The runners can punch the hunter / other runners if they have good timing and use the parkour movement to avoid them.  If you get eliminate you come back as a ghost to “haunt/grief” other runners. Press G to taunt their failures (or pay your respects).It’s a tug of war to get the most points with unpredictable rulesets that are voted on in the chat through the proprietary streamote.tv site where you (using a virtual points system) can bet on who wins, buy rules from the rules store, vote on rulesets during the game, and play Bingo!  Chaotic, action packed with an excellent soundtrack that will leave your head bobbing involuntarily. (available on Spotify, Google Play etc.)How to get started:Once you launch the game you will connect your Twitch account which is super easy to do- then your ingame name will match your Twitch name.Click on inventory* to customize your character- before you “get good” you gotta look good. Just sayin’!!The options menu has the ability to view / rebind controls (I play with inverted mouse).If you are a solo player you can just hit quick play* and get into the action- you will be assigned to a random party.  Once you find a game you can go to the host’s streamote.tv site- for instance if Kappa was playing Streamline theirs would be streamote.tv/Kappa However, where this game shines is the Twitch integration for streamers- using the streamote.tv site that gives everyone something to do- the host (streamer) chooses who is allowed to join the party- open for anyone to join including those who use the “quick play*” feature, invite only to choose specific people, and subscribers only for a quick and easy Sub Sunday event!  The party system even detects who owns the game for ease of use when inviting players.  One of my favorite additions recently was the quick play* feature which allows new players who don’t understand how the streamote.tv site works yet a way to get into a game and meet other players.  And this is a game that can get quite competitive- I was recently at TwitchCon and saw in person how the skill ceiling for Streamline is something that no one really expected.  I got a chance to talk to the best players in the game right now and they are all very friendly but once the game starts so does the competition.  Conclusion / tl;dr:A fast paced, smooth parkour Pacman where one hunter aims to eliminate the runners asap!  A great game for streamers to involve everyone in the chat and get things hype!  The current game mode is limited and there is a high ceiling for potential other game modes.  Team Elimination will be all I play once that mode is finalized. Currently there are 5 maps and many different customization options including exclusive Steam items or Twitch Prime items if you end up owning that version too (free on Twitch Prime through October).  As a streamer this is a must play- if you are the competitive type you can try to take the crown from the best players currently.  Best and only game of its type out there. Worth.*Inventory and Quick Play, other features are this way as of the current version and may be subject to change.**Objective opinion, not compensated for this review.  I received this game for free as part of the alpha testing phase. ",231,27,3,4,12,1,16

								After sitting down with Streamline for just a few hours, I know this is definitely a game to watch. It's still in early access, with a few rough edges, but Proletariat looks to be pouring additional support into the game, so I'm guessing we'll see a lot of improvement. In the meantime, it's a pretty great game for some quick multiplayer sessions.First off, player movement is a blast. While it's super easy to get the hang of wall-running, double-jumping, and boosting around a level, the best players I faced were able to pull off some amazing moves. (Very much in the ""how the heck did they do that"" vein.)Rounds are also quick, and eliminated players don't have to just sit and watch the remaining runners play. They can interfere as ""ghosts,"" stunning other players and chasing after ""haunt"" targets for extra points in the round. (Yes, you can keep scoring points when you're dead.) Some of the game mods play around with ghosts as well, like giving them the ability to eliminate other players or even come back to life for a short time.I did have a few issues with the game: between each game you have to wait a few minutes while stream spectators place bets on the players and use their stream currency to purchase what game mods will appear in each round. If you're not engaging with the stream, (which as far as I can tell requires running Streamote in the background,) this part of the game can drag on. More integration of the stream tools and chat with the game itself is something I'd look forward to in the future.The game mod system in general also adds some great variety to each round, but otherwise it's mainly there to give spectators a way to interact with the game, since players don't interact with it much themselves.If you're a streamer, this game is a must, even in Early Access, but even if you don't stream, there's still something here for you. I imagine it's especially good for LAN parties or played wherever you and your friends can smacktalk each other.			",200,107,1,33,14,2,21

Early Access Review
								Streamline looks more complicated in gameplay videos than it actually is. Within a few rounds you can get a good grip of the game. The game can include up to 16 players. 15 Runners plus a Hunter. The Hunter has the ability to kill the Runners in one hit. The runners compete for points by collecting orbs of differing values while using a dash meter. The dash meter is filled by pickups and you gain more points if you collect orbs while dashing. The movement in the game is context sensitive, as you can wall-run and do similar acrobatic feats while holding a button. If you are killed, you become a ghost. A ghost can no longer collect orbs, but can gain an increasing amount of points by punching a randomly assigned, still-alive runner. The game is played in 3 rounds that last a few minutes and the point total is cumulative, so if you die early in the first round, you can try to make up for it in the second round (and perhaps sabotage the runners who have amassed more points than you). If you are still alive at the end of a round, ghosts disappear and a sudden death commences, where you are finally able to kill the hunter by landing a hit on him, you just have to survive long enough and land a hit. The Hunter is scored via a letter grade (F- to A+ it seems), while the runner with the most points wins.There is intergration with twitch, as you can host or join lobbies by linking your twitch account in-game and then using the developer's twitch player at https://streamote.tv/. You do not have to install anything, as some people seem to be confused on how this works. The end result is that you are able to find lobbies via this website, join a party, and play with a streamer (or if you are a streamer yourself, host). Viewers are able to view the stream of the game and use a point system to influence the game through different global buffs/debuffs that they choose when to activate. They can also bet on who they think will win and rack up more points via bingo in the lobby.To put it simply it's a competitive score-based platformer with asymetrical gameplay (Hunter, Runner & Ghost). It also involves optional stream integration, so that viewers may influence the gameplay. It's still early-access at this point, but feels solid and I have enjoyed the quirky experience so far. Recommended.			",389,272,4,55,29,0,52

								For a game based around movement, its movement system is very clunky. The whole Twitch.tv integration seems to have taken up most of the developer's time since that seems to have more effort put into it than some of the basic gameplay mechanics.			",233,47,6,13,23,2,28

								This game is a great time! It's easy enough that anyone can pick it up and run, but there is also a great community of people who have pushed their game further. Every skill level is welcome and with the stream integration on Twitch it's a blast for streamers and viewers alike. Viewers can change the game in an instant by enacting rules that they've purchased or voted on. They can also play bingo and bet on players. If you're looking for a game to get your entire channel active, this is the one for you!			",101,28,2,26,9,2,11

								Game is DOA. Matchmaking is a !@#$ing joke. Found one match where a team of level ones was up against a level 40 and a level 29.That's the only match I found. I waited for 10 minutes to find another match and found nothing.If they can fix baby's first matchmaking system then this game potentially has a chance. I do see a lot of potential in this game, especially with Twitch integration.But as it is now you can only have fun playing this with friends, and even then Move or Die is a much better game.

								I love this game, but there's some caveats I need to address.PROS: + Really fun+Unique game+Good personalization toolsCONS:-Lack of graphic settings customization-Not worth $20 imo (get it on sale, i got it on a promo where it was free)Also, one note. The servers are usually empty or there are a few people on. Occasionally you will get on a full server, but you have to try a couple times to get on a populated server. I like how they integrated Twitch. It's a great way for Twitch streamers to interact with their audience in game.Would I reccomend this to a friend...? maybe. If it's on sale then yeah totally! Even if you buy it full price, it's a good game. After all it's only in Early Access.			",52,5,1,4,3,0,4

								I know I haven't played a lot, but I feel like I should give this game recognition.From what I've played, nice game that fills an arcade niche and has a pretty good stylised art style.I think the number 1 problem with this game is the lack of people playing it. It has the potential to be a fun little game to mess around in or join up with friends, but there are simply not enough people playing to warrant the price tag.It's not a super serious esports-level game, which is great, because it's accessible. If this game goes on sale, give it a shot, because it just needs the boost in playerbase to become a fun way to pass time.That's just my opinion though.			",33,9,0,4,2,0,0

								This game was made for streaming! I like how it lets your viwers interact with and affect the game, while at the same time events ingame affect minigames in your chat.Viewers can easily join the game and/or play the other half of the game, which happens in your stream channel, where they can add events to the game to help or grief you or the other runners. Ingame, the players are running to collect the most points from orbs, while trying to prevent their opponents from doing the same. These actions and other ingame events appear on bingo sheets played by your channel viewers. Beware of the opponent wielding a stop sign! Avoid getting tagged or killed, depending on the game mode (more modes have been announced). If killed, you get to haunt opponents until sudden death.Visitors to your channel earn coins (or whatever you decide for your currency) that can be used to bet on the players, Betting and bingo winners will recieve coins (or whatever... my channel has cookies!) and ingame character customizations.You don't need to stream if you just want to play. You can also host a party without playing ...or switch between the two. Also, you can play bingo in multiple channels at once, if there are other streamers in the party.Good investment for streamers, great fun for everyone!

								This has to be one of my favorite games, not only because of how it looks or how it plays, but also because it's so interactive.You can basically play the game even if you don't have it, the Twitch stream chat plays a huge role in the matches you play and it really brings the community together.For an Early Access game, it's definitely looking great and I know for a fact that they're only gonna keep improving it since every update has recommendations and bug fixes all chosen by the community which is a thing you don't see often these days.If you're looking for a fun game to play on stream, or to join a streamer in.

								Surprisingly good. Aim of the game is to collect the different coloured orbs for varying amount of points which eventually leads to a sudden death, most points wins. Modifiers are constantly changing the game and aren't irritating which is refreshing and gives it a ton of replayability. The movement system as well is brilliant (Parkour, Sunset Overdrive style), the maps have been designed in tandem with the system and being able to string together lines of orbs never felt better. No issues with the game so far besides some connection at launch however considering this is thousands more players than they are used to they are excused as far as I'm concerned, they had no idea it would be this popular presumably.TL:DR: Brilliant game, fast paced and brilliant movement mechanics, refreshing modifiers, lots of replay value.

								This is a really fun game, especially with friends. I have been able to play quite a few rounds on stream, but also just joining a game in chat and alternating what is happening during the matches is great. You can bet on your favourite player, win points and use that to alternate the matches by adding things like ""the floor is lava"" and more extras. Controls are really easy to get to used to, and you can play this both by using a controller or a mouse and keyboard. The addition of character customisation by getting packs builds up anticipation and adds to the personisation of your game. More stuff is being added, so I am sure this will be a game to play for a long time.			",216,44,10,25,19,4,19

								Streamline is fast-paced game with 2 (technically 3, but two of them are similar) game modes. In the first one a player tries to hit all the other players with a stop sign, while everyone else collects points by doing parkour across various terrains. The second game mode is similar to quidditch in that players try to score goals with a golden ball, but they still do parkour rather than fly on brooms.Players move very fast and rounds are full of additional effects that influence each game (chosen either randomly or by viewers' vote if the game is being streamed on twitch). Things such as the floor turning into lava, players exploding if they touch each other and the camera view rotating at disturbing angles make the gameplay diverse during each game.Moreover, you customize your character with items gained from packs which you open out of play similarly to Hearthstone. From making your character run around in their underpants to having them wear antlers, a gas mask or a hoodie. You can even change your race and gender at any time. Also you have a taunt action which makes your charater do a little performance such as doing the chicken walk or dabbing. It's perfect for when you want want to show off while winning the game.I got Streamline during a free weekend that was held a few months ago and I've been hooked ever since. I already reached the maximum currently available character level but don't plan on stopping. I just find it that much fun.P.S. As mentioned above all in-game items are cosmetic, so they don't influence the player's perfomance in the game, i.e. the game is not pay2win. So only play if you've got da skillz :P			",8,1,0,0,0,0,1

								I think This is a really neat concept. being able to interact closer with twitch streamers and viewers by affacting the playing field in many different ways. I was fortunate enough to get this game during a livestream for GassyMexican which winners of the games would get to compete at twitchcon, Twice had i been chosen to compete alongside others, unfortunately i had tech difficulties on my end with connection and my laptop not being as powerful as it ought to be to load the game quicker. But playing in training mode to familiarize myself with the game mechanics it is quite the fun game to play.You can wall-run, jump off the walls, double jump, you can crouch and slide across the ground, you can dive left or right to avoid getting slammed by the twitch streamer's Stop sign, and be the one to collect the most points in the end and then everyone turn their gazes at the twitch streamer and kill him.The idea of allowing even the viewers to participate in the game even if they cannot afford it is quite something. I've seen games where it's just voting by typing a word or phrase in the chat, but with streamline and the twitch modifications, it makes it more enjoyable by selecting different power ups, modifiers that could help or ruin players, Bet with streamote currecny on who you think will win (not real currency) play bingo with everyone and earn more streamote currency. I really enjoy the game and would like to play this on my stream someday. first i must amass a following to do that. sadly having 7 followers who rarely appear won't be enough. feelsbadman			",75,9,0,4,1,3,0

								It's an amazing game. Even at a $20 pricetag you get great value. No P2W features. You play with a ton of streamers and when you join their discord you end up meeting a ton of cool people. They are pulling the Twitch community together quickly.As far as the game goes it's extremely addicting and fun. We've already had tournaments with cash prizes and contributed tons to the game. The Devs are amazing and interact with their community. They listen and you may end up seeing your idea implemented into game.Yes there are bugs (most are rare and you may not ever see one), it's in Alpha, the Devs are working very hard to address those. Obviously there were technical issues when they released the game for 24 hours as F2P. All games have that issue when their servers are flooded. Nonetheless, the game is still fun. :DSo what are you waiting for? Join their Discord, get the game and have a blast!!!Happy Hunting ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Streamline is an alternative pvp title that is balanced towards quick bursts of gameplay during which you parcour around the arena and try to earn as many points as possible while dodging beaters that trade off when they tag you.  Matches are just long enough that you can squeeze in a match when you have some down time and aren't quite sure what you feel like playing next.  You can tell that the developers took careful care to balance the gameplay, ensuring that the matches never lull through use of dead zones and gameplay modifiers that occur over the course of a match.  The avatar customization is a bit basic, hat/shirt/pants and colors for each, but at the very least there are plenty of options to unlock for each of those slots.  Ultimately, the only downfall of this game is that the timing of the release ensured that this diamond is completely buried by not only the rough, but bigger and nicer diamonds.  It is hard to get those moments of downtime that this game could capitalize on when you could be busy playing the new Overwatch patch, Final Fantasy 15, Titanfall 2, Watchdogs 2, etc.  It is a shame because for what its worth, Streamline is a fun game.  It just lacks a thriving community because everyone is busy with other titles.			",249,88,2,22,18,2,13

As the description says, this game does indeed have DEEP twitch integration, and is a great game to have fun with viewers. The current features are betting on players, bingo, and obviously viewers able to join a party made by the streamer. It has a great parkour system, not the best, but wonderful none the less. This game is amazing to have fun with friends and other streamers, I can gurantee a great time! I've had a blast playing this game and meeting new people to play with, and so can you!

								Don't pay attention to those negative reviews, For the short time playing this game I personally like it.Yes may seem like those 30 to an hour session only game but look below my friends ""Early Access"" and its free so they must have something greater in store for this little parkour running beat'em up with stop signs.Plus most the negative reviews dont even have 1 hour, if you're going to review a game even if it's as awful as the wonderful perfect masterpiece of ""Barbie and Her Sisters Puppy Rescue"" then by all means that game should be on steam's top sellers.In simple it's a Parkour, collecting, Stop Sign Beat em up, With Funny Random Occuring(Unless with a streamer then the viewers choose your nightmare) chasing game.  BUT  It is a early access game that is recently been getting updates. So at less give support and try it out.I don't know what I'm doing.Just try it you weinars.I give this 10 Stop Signs to the face out of 10 Shrink RaysIm sorry for wasting your time.

								When I first looked at this game I wasn't too impressed by the images. I was putting the game off until I randomly searched it on Twitch out of curiosity. I've watched the same stream play the game for about 2 days before deciding to install it myself(Twitch Prime game at the time) and just jump into it. Was a bit confusing at first but I eventually understood how to pull myself near 1st place every time. Now I'm pretty much one of the tougher players in this game.So I figured I'll write a positive review after playing the game for 70+ hours.Streamline is a fun game once you understand the mechanics well enough.  If you watch a lot of Twitch and a streamer you like play this game weekly then I would recommend the game to you. Otherwise I would say wait till the game becomes a bit more feature complete. The devs are active and the regulars of the game are mainly helpful to new players. I may be terrible at describing this game to people... I mean I tell every new person this game is ""Mirror's Pacman Extreme Tag Edition + Viewer Trolling DLC.""To sum up the game for now.-Run around and gather points to be the highest scoring player in the round.-If in a streamer's lobby you'll have viewers on that stream voting for random rules to help or mess you up!(Don't need the game for this).-There's a player with a stop sign that like hitting other players.-The game seems to be a quest to see if you can dress your virtual character in random outfits. 11/10.

								First let me say i'm not very good at games, that being said i love this game even if winning doesn't happen. I've met so many new amazing friends playing this game i love the community that's being built around this game. I think the twitch integration bingo/betting is my favorite part, i like hanging out in Streamline streams that have a lot of people from the community on discord voice chat, the ""playful"" trash talk is amazing.Overall the game does take some skill and can be very challenging depending on the group you're playing with. The developers of the game are very community minded, they have a constant direct line open on their discord to problem solve and to receive feedback because they care about the community, most problems are addressed immediately and taken very seriously. So yeah if you see negative posts here in regards to tech issues they've probably been handled long ago or are issues they've been made aware of and are being worked on. Definitely recommend this game to everyone.			",40,27,0,7,4,1,5

								 PARKOUR and PLAYING TAG on fun maps is a great combination for a multiplayer game. Some people might get put off when they first start the game and it asks you to login with your Twitch account. A lot of people are not even going to try it because of that, and I think the developers made a mistake forcing it. It's a shame too, because you don't need to stream it, just make an account in a second (if you don't have one) and you can join a match instantly. The game itself is very fun and fluid. Running around, doing parkour, jumping, fighting other players in mid air, wall running, cool tricks.. It has it all.			",121,22,7,11,12,1,6

								Thank you for the free game devs! It's a great game! Like a 3D pacman. Running around parkour style collecting points and avoiding the hunter. Still, finding a game and connecting to it should be easier. Also please dont force people to sign up for twitch - kinda sucks that you need a twitch account to play this game! UPDATE: According to the devs they will be changing all of that in the near future (see comment section) At this point the game is really promising but still needs a bit of work.Try it if you like the concept!P.S. Check out the trading cards for this game if you are a badge collector - they are rather cheap at the moment!			",37,39,1,10,4,2,6

								A breath of fresh air!Streamline has me hooked! The interaction between Twitch chat and the game keeps you on your toes (never know when fallen players will rise from the dead and beat your points out of you!) . Broadcasters will flock to ths interactive game for their chat and fellow opponents. Always fun for chat to grief the players with Ugh, Ice Level and The Floor Is Lava events!Aside from the hijinks, the game has some great customization options; which is always a plus for me in any game. I can swap from a sporty look one game to a kawaii fox outfit, then taunt my foes with a victory Moonwalk. If you're looking for a fast paced game with shifting in-game events that you can play with a great community, Streamline is a great addition to your library!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The game works well with relatively big or small streams, and while the mechanics are simple (the hunter has to find the other players), it definitely keeps you engaged and includes the viewers as well. The player's ability to go after remaining survivors even after death and the betting system make it even more fun. You can also hit people with stop signs.10/10 would crab core again			",39,8,1,4,4,1,0

YouTube™ Video: Streamline [Early Access Review] 

			Views: 219		

			My review of ""Streamline"", multiplayer free-for-all game about free-running with Twitch integration developed and published by Proletariat Inc. Copy supplied by developer.		

Game: StreamlineGenre: Free-for-All MultiplayerDeveloper: Proletariat Inc.Publisher: Proletariat Inc.Copy supplied by developerStreamline is a multiplayer free-for-all game about free-running with Twitch integration developed and published by Proletariat Inc.GRAPHICSDeveloped with Unreal Engine 4, the game's cell-shaded graphics and cartoonish look are polished and pretty. While nothing mind-blowing, each level looks and feels different, and there are enough small buildings to climb and crates to vault without being too big or overcrowded.GAMEPLAYThe game is a 16 player free-for-all version of Tag. One player is the Hunter, and he has to hit another player to make him become the Hunter, while everyone else is a Runner, and they have to collect as many points as possible.The free-running feels smooth but never too fast for its own good. The big gimmick of the game is that it is integrated with Twitch, and viewers can interact directly by adding powerups and variables: turn the floor to lava, force all players to jump or only move sideways, remove all points from the map, etc. They are fun and they do make each game feel different from the others.The only issue I have is that it lacks variety at its core: there are no other game modes right now, and there is a lack of players, so good luck in finding a full server.CHALLENGEThe game isn't particularly hard, and you get the grasp of the controls and parkour very fast. Runners can punch each other to steal points and let the Hunter get to them first, but it still isn't enough to change the tides of your situation. It is really hard for you to succesfully recover from a last position after the first round, but thankfully the game is pretty fast and you can level up pretty easily nontheles, making the experience not frustrating.SOUNDThe soundtrack by Matthew Harwood and Breakmaster Cylinder is solid and fun, bringing a lot of energy to the game. The sound effects are fun, with a couple of noises that tend to get annoying in the long run.REPLAYABILITYThe Twitch integration and its Early Access status make this a solid game to play multiple times in the future. Hopefully the player base will increase.Overall, this is a solid multiplayer game with a nice gimmick and solid controls.

								Streamline is one of the great accomplishments, it is one of the most amazing games I have ever played. The game can be broken down in 3 different ways. 1: You can jump 2: You can hit things 3: You can watch the 3 people who actually play this game play this game. That's really what it comes down to. Also, bring this game to Wii U. Everyone should know what this game feels like to play. I could write an entire essay on this game. I'm in tears now. This game gives you such an emotional attatchment to it.			",179,21,0,20,17,5,10

								Streamline is a really neat parkour game where you run around collecting ""gems"" all while trying to survive and eliminate other players. I really like the art style and smooth gameplay. Right now I feel like the biggest issue is that Streamline has a very low playerbase. Hopefully as development continues the game gets more press and can be pick up in popularity. I recommend anyone interested try it, its not bad, even if it has low population at the moment. The game is actively being developed but fingers crossed that it makes it through early access.

								Parkour PacMan Tag with a frantic super smackdown at the end? Sign me UP. I'm a simple creature, and the game is fun, period. A match goingfrom a leisure point grabbing party to frantic dodging left me and my friends swearing vengeance at each other amidst laughter at every smack and punch. Any game that does that is my kinda game. No real complaints there that won't be tackled by the more critcal player. The character customization is well done and nice to look at; always addicting to keep winning new options so keep em' coming. (I wouldn't mind being able to wear some of the options in the hat section with the hair I actually chose, just to nit pick there.) As far as cons, my biggest is with the party creation. It was such a pain trying to hop into a match with my actual friends. Going through the join game option on your steam friends list isn't always reliable, and with streamote I'd get a full lobby easy on the first try, but it wouldn't attempt to refill as others were leaving post game. Also had some issues actually disbanding the party. I had to shut the game down a few times because it got stuck. I don't mind making a twitch account just to play, but I'm looking forward to the option to opt out of using it.			",28,4,1,8,1,0,10

								Product received for freeI initially got into this game because I thought, ""Hey free trip to Twitch Con if I can be good at this game."" Pro tip: Don't expect to win or be good the first time you pick up the game and definitely don't have your first game be in the comp itself, lol. However, that's not to say you won't shine when you log in the first time. Anyway, after suffering a shameful defeat, I was still drawn back to the game. I met players through the Proletariat discord and we ended up playing a lot together. After playing this game for about two months, I've made so many friends and met so many amazing people, including the amazing Proletariat team. This isn't just a game. This is a community full of such diversity and awesomeness. You'll always have someone to play with and you'll always be welcome on in. After their newest release and listening to some of the ideas thrown around, there's no stopping the progression of this game and there will always be something for everyone. As a note of their customer support? Outstanding. They're always willing to help and make sure you're able to get back to gaming asap. Even if it's late at night and they might not be around, if you pop into discord, there's almost always someone awake who may be able to help you out. <3			",13,1,1,2,0,0,0

								An interesting concept that reminds me of the TF2 mod TF2Ware, but without the speed ups and minigames, rather competing for points while facing modifications to the game or the map itself placed by viewers. It's fun, simple, and easy. It's not very competitive too, allowing for a good casual experience to just have fun with other players while viewers vote on previously mentioned modifications.

								Parkour PacMan Tag with a frantic super smackdown at the end? Sign me UP. I'm a simple creature, and the game is fun, period. A match goingfrom a leisure point grabbing party to frantic dodging left me and my friends swearing vengeance at each other amidst laughter at every smack and punch. Any game that does that is my kinda game. No real complaints there that won't be tackled by the more critcal player. The character customization is well done and nice to look at; always addicting to keep winning new options so keep em' coming. (I wouldn't mind being able to wear some of the options in the hat section with the hair I actually chose, just to nit pick there.) As far as cons, my biggest is with the party creation. It was such a pain trying to hop into a match with my actual friends. Going through the join game option on your steam friends list isn't always reliable, and with streamote I'd get a full lobby easy on the first try, but it wouldn't attempt to refill as others were leaving post game. Also had some issues actually disbanding the party. I had to shut the game down a few times because it got stuck. I don't mind making a twitch account just to play, but I'm looking forward to the option to opt out of using it.			",28,4,1,8,1,0,10

								Product received for freeI initially got into this game because I thought, ""Hey free trip to Twitch Con if I can be good at this game."" Pro tip: Don't expect to win or be good the first time you pick up the game and definitely don't have your first game be in the comp itself, lol. However, that's not to say you won't shine when you log in the first time. Anyway, after suffering a shameful defeat, I was still drawn back to the game. I met players through the Proletariat discord and we ended up playing a lot together. After playing this game for about two months, I've made so many friends and met so many amazing people, including the amazing Proletariat team. This isn't just a game. This is a community full of such diversity and awesomeness. You'll always have someone to play with and you'll always be welcome on in. After their newest release and listening to some of the ideas thrown around, there's no stopping the progression of this game and there will always be something for everyone. As a note of their customer support? Outstanding. They're always willing to help and make sure you're able to get back to gaming asap. Even if it's late at night and they might not be around, if you pop into discord, there's almost always someone awake who may be able to help you out. <3			",13,1,1,2,0,0,0

								Ehh... well, I loaded it up and it appeared on my main monitor in the incorrect resolution. Took forever to get the options to to change the res. I don't like how I was forced to sign into Twitch account (why in ♥♥♥♥ would I want to do that) I almost quit the game when the resolution suddenly worked.10 minutes ago I started searching for a game on the EU Ireland server, still waiting.... not able to go back from the waiting screen so I guess I just sit here and wait for it to find a server that isn't there or I ctrl+alt+del this♥♥♥♥♥♥OK  so the match finally loaded up, I was finally given options to look at controls and options. Enjoyed the character creation, the game is ""fun"" but it's also ""not fun."" I played one match, came 3rd and I had no idea what I was doing. No InGame VOIP or Chat to speak of.6/10 - download for free, wait until it is further down the development .			",62,7,0,6,3,0,3

								An interesting concept that reminds me of the TF2 mod TF2Ware, but without the speed ups and minigames, rather competing for points while facing modifications to the game or the map itself placed by viewers. It's fun, simple, and easy. It's not very competitive too, allowing for a good casual experience to just have fun with other players while viewers vote on previously mentioned modifications.

								Very vivid game. A nice revival of tag in a world that's meant to look like a video game of the future. My only issues being that the quality settings are super limited (no windowed/resolution options?) and that all the colours on screen at once are a little hard on my eyes. As a free game you have nothing to lose. I'd be hard pressed to pay anything above 20 dollars for this though.			",95,11,3,5,2,1,5

								So far, I love this game. It might take you a bit longer than some to get the hang of, if you're stoned like I was when I first tried (lol) but once you get into it, it's actually pretty entertaining. Love the lighting effects, the fast pace, the different modes you see throughout a single match, let alone a single round. I love the references to Valve games and others (TF2, Portal, Fallout (I'm *pretty* it's Fallout, at least), etc. I love the little bag drops you get after a match, unlocking new aesthetic and other implements to tune up your player as you go along, such as clothing/item colours, new clothes/shoes, new taunts etc.This game, from the start, made me think ""Pac-Man World meets Battle Royale"". At this early point, the only thing I would point out is that the required Twitch login and how it's implemented makes it difficult for plebs like myself who can't rightly figure out how to create a party to get a new match started (though I'd previously had a Twitch account, I was never an avid user by any means, so I'm unfamiliar with any sort of streaming interface).Overall rating of 8/10 for an early access game (and, note, at the time of this review this is still pretty early af access kinda, idk maybe? yeah.) One last thing: though I got the game for free, I'd say its well worth its actual list price.UPDATE: This will be kept in my review until I know why it happens or until it is fixed. Since updating the game, whenever I try to launch, it just crashes. Anyone else experiencing this?			",149,7,1,7,6,2,2

								Want to play a hyper♥♥♥♥♥game of tag?! Streamline is it and them more with lots of random effects changing how the game flows. Honestly seeing some of the reviews here, a lot of the unrecommendations are for really petty reasons.So let me give you what you need to know.Each round is more or less 5 mins of playing human pacman, running and collecting points, beating up other Runners to steal their points, beating up the Hunter to get style points. Last 30 secinds become a free for all where you must smash bop and BONK everyone insight still you the last one standing. Lots of levels of mind-games are included. You also get loot after every game. So you feel rewarded regardless of what you do.The con, more or less it would be that you need a twitch account to play and even host matches.All and all it's shaping up to be a really great game, and I'm sure the full release will be something spactular with tons more stages and outfit items.

								I've had Streamline since early alpha, and I'm still pretty excited whenever I see a party forming. It's a great way to relax for an evening- it's fun, lighthearted, and easy to get into. The poppy art style and kickin' music are easygoing and suit the game nicely. The character customization is especially fun- the sheer number of cosmetics ensures that you'll always get something new after a match.The gameplay is fast paced and fun, easy to jump into but contains several nuances that make it competitive for those who want a deeper experience. Things like dodge rolling and knowing your lines can separate a good player from a great player.I'm most excited about the new modes that Proletariat has been pushing out- Tag is an excellent addition to Streamline, and embraces the multiple ways to play and win a match. The extra maps that have been added are also super enjoyable- and super gorgeous. Overall I think that Streamline is definitely worth your time! It's fun to hop into a game with a streamer you know, even if it's just for a few rounds of Tag. For free, that game is a gimme- and a good way to kill an evening with a dozen of your buddies.

								While the game is very fun and interesting, it is really hard to find a match with more than 2 other people. I don't think it is worth the  $20 yet. If the game can manage to get more players online it could become a great time waster that you play whenever you get burned out from other games.			",94,20,0,2,8,2,6

								Definetly not worth 20 bucks.It is a fun game, but it is lacking content and the multiplayer barely works.It definetly has a lot of potential, and i'll be watching for updates, but until they fix the major bugs and add some content, i cannot recommend this game, unless you got it for free.

								For a full picture of what this game is like, there are plenty of reviews one can read, or even watch videos from your favorite streamer or ‘tuber and educate themselves about the game and all the small details it entails, I'm not here to write a full review, but to simply make a small first impression comment, which is the following;Streamline is the red-headed step child of what you would get if Mirror's Edge and Pixar decided to make the first community driven Parkour game that focuses on streamlined (har-har) map activities, rather then being open world, via the gratifying fast paced game-play and loot system akin that of Overwatch.However, the praises stop there.The game suffers from a chicken or egg situation, I cannot attest if it's because the community (at least here on Steam) is passing barely the 130 people mark on a day to day basis, or because the servers refuse to put people together, but the community is more scarce then even Dark Souls 1 ever was during past summer (and that's saying something considering networking was broken by BamCo in DS1 during 2016).Fan's don't want to admit this, but it's true, the matchmaking is a nightmare to say the least.On several occasions, in Streamline, I idled for not 5 or 10, but almost 50 minutes flat waiting for a match to start, and this is during mid-day in NA region, where apparently most users are online. I can only imagine what a pain it must be during the ‘off-hours’ (you know, when people are off work and actually can play games) when around those times, the population can drop as low as below 50.Forget about playing late at night, because unless you enter the Twilight Zone for EU and Asian time zone, and meet your occasional late time players, there literally won't be anyone playing.Say what you want, but if an old 5 year old ‘dead’ game which only has the most basic of networking (Dark Souls) still is able to have people playing together in less then 5 minutes, I think it’s fair to say Streamline has some issues.Even though in theory that shouldn’t be an issue, because a match is a match and a match can allocate up to 15 people, so at any given time, with about 150 people, I should be easily finding 10 matches ongoing, I still find myself barely scrapping by in 4 people matches.You best bet is to idle in Streamote and wait for someone to Stream the game then and join their public party. This is the best bet at finding constant matches, or wait for the specific week-days in which the Dev's themselves Stream the game, which seems to be always bursting with people strangely enough.Maybe Streamline will bounce (pun intended) around and become essentially a more casual version of Overwatch without guns, or maybe, some smarmy British accented ‘tuber will make a video and inject some new blood in the game, or maybe all those ♥♥♥♥♥ who were idling in the game for 10 cents cards will finally decide to play games instead of working for chicken feed.

								Streamline is a very fun and fast paced game, I recommend it totaly. even though I have very few hours in this game.It reminds me of the good old S4 League in some aspects, I want to see this game grow and become succesful when it comes out.Its best if you play with friends, but playing with random people is also very fun.I'd rate it 9 out of 10, because it still needs to add more gamemodes and such kind of things.Also it doesn't seem to be paytowin so thats great.

								I tried that game, Streamline for about 35 minutes according to steam. Had two matches.It's very .... Lackluster.The parkour is automatic, it doesn't control like you want, the maps force you get more enclosed as time goes on, and it's basically a giant game of tag where you people who aren't tagged can hit each other anyways.The performance runs fine, but the content is lackluster.Not to mention but the randomized effects caused by twitch streamers are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful.Sjit like ""The floor is lava"" on maps where you legitimately can get trapped behind the lavaSlow down mode. No touchingThats not even the worst of it.The levelup system is slow as hell, I got second place in my first two matches in a row, and got 40/150 for each one. These are matches where you're expected to have 16 people in them.The map selection is also fairly limited.I got cycled back to my first map on the potential third round, except I couldn't even play cause I was sitting there for five minutes and nobody joined the lobby.While I admitedly got the game for free, it goes for 20 bucks, and i'd not recomend that price even for hardcore streamers.

								Nothing beats the adrenaline of dekeing out all of your opponents, becoming the last person standing, and taking out the hunter yourself. Streamline is a great Parkour Multiplayer game that doesn't involve shooting, killing creeps, or magic. Currently, the population is fairly low, however, you can get a game during most evenings. When you get in, it's a ton of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I got this for free. I played for a bit, after trying to find a server with other people playing, which took half an hour, i got into a match. With 3 other players.It feels like a mini-game ripped from a bigger MMO, only without MMO. I thought it was f2p to be honest, and then i went to check out the store page, and saw a 20 euro price tag.It feels like reading an unfinished book, that someone stopped writing after the first two chapters, and put it for sale just to make up money for wasted time.
