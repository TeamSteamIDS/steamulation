												1. Click the Drop Down Menu Under Fight and Choose Skirmish.2. Then Click the Heads Icon Near it and choose 2 vs 2.3. That way you'll find and join 4 player games and not be stuck in a 16 player que waiting forever!4. THUMBS UP this Post so New Players can see!Also Game needs improvements ofc but I had a lot of Laughs and Fun.Pretty Hilarious beating on a guy when he's down on the ground or Knocking someone out with a Cardboard Box!

								""Hooligan Fighters is an online multiplayer game that in our opinion will live for years so""I don't think so, Tim.8 people playing on launch day. Game is terribad. You get to pick from three attacks. It plays like some kind of weird flash game, complete with terrible music, graphics and gameplay.Thanks to Steam for the refund system, otherwise I'd be stuck with this one forever.

												I really like the idea behind this game since i'm a martial arts fanatic, but the gameplay is awful. I hoped for a refined battle system with actual moves to execute, but... there are no moves, just combo, and ultimately this one is a button mashing game. It gets boring after a couple of matches.  Not recommended.			",62,20,0,10,1,0,0

												So, this project started out as a 3D version of the successful game ""Hooligansgame"" made by a Polish company in Łódź, who were also known to release ""Ultras Online"" back in the day. The developers of THIS game wanted to piggyback off their success but became a sad attempt after all, starting out under the name of ""Hooligan fighters"", later ""Hooligan Warriors"" naturally the people expected the developers to add actual club insignia and perhaps an overworld. When the developers realized it was too much work, they gave up on the concept, made it a generic fighting game and renamed it ""Street Warriors online"", which already in itself tells you how much they care about their fanbased compared to how much they only care about a quick buck.While they did put some effort in motion tracking to make the fighting moves realistic and while the maps are beautifully designed I really, really urge you not to play this game due to the developer's crappy mentality that only goes after money, unwilling to listen to any feedback the users give them. Believe me, I gave them a shot, I tried to make them listen but to no avail. The fighting in itself is really generic, stale and requires no skills at all. And instead of doing something about it, the developers, yet again, fail to listen to constructive criticism and instead make a salty post on Facebook simply calling everyone a hater and begging people for thumbs up.

												It's a simple left and right click beat them up.A few added weapons lying about, a special attack when your meter is full.I enjoyed myself so I will give it a thumbs up. (Easily pleased)Shame about the lack of players.			",68,7,0,10,2,0,10

												This game is what happens when you try to make an online fighting game but forget to make it goodPROS+Always lots of people to play with+Decent amount of fighter cusomizationCONS-Combat is very basic and has very little strategy-Melee weapon attacks can be spammed and take away most of your health-Secondary currency-Pay to win-Frequent game breaking glitches-Fighter will often face the wrong way when you attempt to blockDont waste your time with this game. It may be improved in the future but for now, avoid it.OVERALL: 4/10			",116,13,4,9,18,0,6

								*MOST POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE FROM DEVELOPER ALT ACCOUNTS OR FRIENDS OF DEVELOPERS*The game is only popular in Europe, and when I say ""popular"" I mean, 10 people online consistantly..... The biggest problem is they will be region locking everybody so now it will REALLY be a dead game for anyone outside Europe. Its a shame I spent 30 hours on this game in the last 3 days, spent 20 dollers on 2 accounts and premium status to try and support it, along with combatting the negative misleading reviews on Steam. But i've come to realise after all that.... AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS IF YOU ARE NOT FROM EUROPE. You will just pour money into a game that hasnt even been thought out yet.Just about every system in the game is broken or hasnt even been thought out properly yet. The combat is beyond exploitable, players just spam 1 single attack over and over again to keep you in a constant stun. Its like, didnt you think about that when you built the combat system you dumb ♥♥♥♥♥? I understand this is early access but it feels like these developers are using alphabet blocks for the first time as babies... And if you had any brains, you would just avoid this game all together. Its one of those cash grabs that will never come out of early access. Its lead by two developers who seem like theyve never seen how an MMO works.So yeah, now i've certainly built a grudge and will be doing everything in my power to destroy its reputation on steam. Stay away from this peasent filled game developed by some eggheads in a war torn country.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I recommend to wait, till game gets out of EA. Game looks promising.I played this game for a while, but in current state it wasn't much fun.First of all - as many indie game - no tutorial and small fonts.The confusing menu... why do I have option for ""drinks"" when I wasn't even introduced to their mechanics?I even like the main concept of the game, but it needs a lot of polishing. It quickly gets boring, because you are matched with bots...Also music doesn't fit my ears' ""taste"" :(			",445,151,17,46,41,7,47

												Honestly, i like the game.  I think it's fun.  Yea, it's really basic but i like it.  It's worth a shot for no money.  Glad i didn't listen to the reviews.Edit - So I played 20 hours now and I still like it.  I dont know why people think its terrible.  I mean the graphics aren't good, but I enjoy the combat.  Punch button, kick button, block button.  You string together combos.  You customize a string of punches and a string of kicks and when you press the punch button it does the string, the kick button does the kick string.  I don't  work for the company, not getting any benefits by saying this.  Thing is it's free and it takes 2 seconds to download and try.  If you hate it you hate it, if you think it's fun it's fun.  If you need good graphics in a game,  you'll probably look at it and think it's hideous but if you can look past that and have fun with gameplay in a basic streetfighting simulator, it's fun.Pros--Fun gameplay-Fun game modes-Fun to create combos-I enjoy making the character play how i wantCons--small community, you will be fighting a lot of ai.  can't even get a 2 on 2 match usually-poor matchmaking.  certain levels cant fight other levels so it makes it hard to play with friends sometimes-bad graphics			",149,30,0,16,11,1,5

												Ok so where the I start? First of all the big benefit with this game is that it is Free to play. Secondaly this game IS NOT pay 2 win, It simply has things like punches and kicks you can upgrade by earning respect which you earn through playing more matches, I have found myself come accross people with better clothes and abilities and beat a few in a 1v1 situation. It really isn't Pay 2 win it's more of a case of investing time into a game to make yourself better. Thirdly the devs are currently active which is good so you can report any technical issues or share your thoughts to them through social media.Overall I found this game very fun to play and I'm still currently playing it. I can't wait to see what it brings in the future. I'd highly suggest playing it and playing it for a while before actually giving a review. I enjoy the fact that this game is a different genre to most games on steam too. It's Free to play so why not give it a go?			",63,0,3,0,7,3,0

												If you like some of the free to play games out there like the street baskeball one, you may like this.  The graphics are pretty outdated and the combat feels clunky and sometimes unresponsive.  If you are a fighting game lover, you really will NOT like this, as the combat also does not play like any traditional fighter game. Your punches and kicks do not prevent your opponent, who is attacking you at the same time, from just mashing those same buttons at the same time, aside from the occassional stun or knockdown of course.  The drinks and cards are hidden behind a pay wall, which serves as kind of a temporary cheat in the fights taht doesn't feel right in the game (imo), but can be purchased with currency from playing the game as well.  So not really a total pay to win, but can be if someone shells a crap ton of money on the game and you are matched up against them, then you can just flip your tables and rage quit, or punch your arm rest on your chair, or scream while puffing out your chest as if it is actually growing like you are the Hulk.For a free to play game it is alright, but nothing I can find myself giving more time on. (and yes I only put in 30 mins into it, so take that into consideration while reading this review.)  I wouldn't recommend it to people myself.  But, again, it is free to play, so check it out for yourself and make your own opinions about the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
