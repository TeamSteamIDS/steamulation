								Review Update - Assetto Corsa V.08Short version: I highly recommend bying  AC. Although right now it is not a finished  game, but still a game in early acces (~beta) and key fetures like MP are not enabled yet.But what you get right now, is well worth the money and one of teh best racing sims out there. What the heck is Assetto Corsa?AC is the work of a small Italian independent Studio: Kunos Simulazione, in sim racing circles around the world known for Net Kar Pro, held in highest regards due to its driving/physic engine and tyre model.  Never heard of it? -  Just like me. I was happy with the likes of GT 5/6 and Forza, never cared for what was going on on pc and didn't know what I was missing. Anyhow, Assetto Corsa is a pc racing simulator that tries not only to appeal to its own core audience of pc sim racers, but is aimed at console players too.  Assetto Corsa builds up on the predecessor Net Kar Pro, and if successfu,l will see updates, DLC and additional features for years.Assetto Corsa  - What makes it special?IFUN!  - Yes Fun, becausedriving is as much fun in the game as it is in real live. AC is a simulator which gets and provides exactly that.Unlike a lot of otherr sims AC is very accessible, easy to get into but hard to master. The Driving Experience in AC: Just take a seat in the 1st car you like and start driving (my 1st love: BMW E30 DTM@Mugello) - Within the first round I had a big smile on my face, never before had I experienced such a great feedback and immersion with a Racing Game. - with a pad none the less The cars are  alive and responsive, you really feel  weight transfer, the tyres, and every part of the track - imho neither the GT Series, nor the Forza titles or the Sim Bin games I tried on pc  come even close. AC's driving/physics and tyre model is exquisit and unique in its way of easing you into it and letting you explore its depths. If you are looking for something in a racing game that is more detailed and refined than what you already know, then Assetto Corsa is without a doubt the right choice for you. Pad/WheelGreat improvement with Pad support in the latest update, no issues anymire.Though every Sim Racer will tell you, that you have to buy a wheel to enjoy this game that isn't true at all.  To this day I'm driving with a pad and have put 100+hours into AC with a XBox360 Controller and had more fun than I ever had with GT 5 or Forza or any other racing game - i.e. most of the pc simulators sounded like work to me till AC came around. I don't own a 3 Monitor setup, Racing Seat, wheel etc. - just a decent pc which allows me to play on high settings. So you can have fun and lots of it, and the driving experience is still a lot better than GT/Forza.  Amount/Quality of contentKunos got their hands on some 1st rate licenses, among them Mercedes (not yet in game), Lotus, BMW and Ferrari and more. AC focuses on GT2/GT3 cars and open wheelers  like the ""almost F1"" Lotus Exos S1 and the awesome old ""Lauda"" Ferrari . But more cars are to come, historicals F1, and much more. Every car is beautifully modelled and whileForza and expecially GT feature hundreds of beautiful cars from all ends of the spectrum,  Kunos is not an industry giant like them and can't ever compete with that amount of original content. But the car selection is still more than decent, all  the tracks in AC are laser scanned and the variety is great - i.e.the Nurburgring GP track and it feels and plays awesome!But here is the main thing: Assetto Corsa is moddable, that means fans are invited to produce and create tracks, cars, skins, Apps and much more - easy to install and a superb enrichment to AC. Just take a look at the beautiful skins or useful apps in the community videos - absolutely amazing, the creators deserve much praise. A big thank you to all the modders and unsung heroes out there!Graphics/Sounds:Very good, but not the very best (upcoming Project Cars) and the performance depends as always mostly on your GPU.  I use a Palit Geforce 770 4GB and play it with high settings. But this game is as you know by now not finished yet and will see a lot of improvements on quality and performace - and some of it has already been done. A low level pc with onboard grafix won't do, but with a high end system you can easily play on resolutions beyond 1920*1080.Sound is above average and good, but is lacking punch in some cars and will improve with future updates. For those who can't wait for that, there are of course already some sound mods out there.Conclusion  - Enough of the rambling rave - be part of Early Access!There are a lot of things that are not perfect in AC yet, and some that are even quite frustrating at the moment. Some issues like setting up and finetuning controllers have been fixed and teh latest update saw the AI behaviour extremely improves. Almost all the frustrating and unfair behaviour are gone, most races are really great fun now with clean racing. The new AI is certainly among the best out there: they really race, they do not drive in a straight line behind each other and bore you to death. They actually give the very immersive impression that they want to beat you, they overtake you and each other, they make mistakes, defend their racing line and so on. With Update 08 most if not all of the terrible AI behaviour is gone anf there are only minor problems left.I can't stress enough how impressive the work of the small KUnos team really is. They kept word on every promise they made, gave or announced additional free contet and their updates are coming every 2 weeks - V08 is definitely a hughe step toward a final release version. Full VersionThe full version of Assetto Corsa game is epected to be released within the next 2-4 months, and the complete content will be available then. That includes Multiplayer, Career mode and certain cars/tracks etc. Till then you get updates every 14 days, which include bugfixes, new features or new content. Until now Kunos stayed true to their word and kept the good things coming. To me this a must-by for everybody who likes to play racings games on whatever system or plattform. If you want the full time hard core simulation immersion - AC delivers just that, but if you just want to have fun driving or racing without a hassle, just pic a car, and AC delivers just that too.And while it certainly isn't perfect and unpolished in some areas, it is very stable and relativeley bugfree (2 crashes during 150+ hours of play). Of course there is much to be done, bugs to be fixed, Controller, grafic performance optimization, adding features like Multiplayer etc. - but I really feel by now that Kunos deserves trust.I will update this review when and if essential features are added and the final version is released.

								Maybe the saviour of PC sim racing?Don't get me wrong, there are other sims on the PC that are stunning in their own right, but Assetto Corsa might be the first in a long, long time that may be able to capture the hearts of the true sim racing crowd and the more casual racer/gamer. And boy does the PC racing scene need a fresh boost like this.Talking of physics for a moment, I am not sure it's as all-conquering as some are saying, but that doesn't take away from the experience - the physics are still pretty darn impressive and right up there with the best on PC and destorys the consoles (as you would expect). One of the breakthrough aspects of the cars is how planted and solid they feel under the limit, which means those fresh to real sim racing will find it less frustrating to enjoy and ""get it"". But push any car to its limit and you'll quickly realize there is serious depth here. I currently prefer AC to any other sim out there when i think of physics, fun factor, potential, and so on.The current car and track list--which is now coming in stages whilst in beta-- is drool worthy. Ferrari F40, 458, BMW M3 GT2, Spa, Monza, Imola -  it just goes on and on, and all the tracks are laser scanned, too. Some classics are missing, but with modding support and promises of DLC in the future, I can see many of these such as Sebring, Mid Ohio and Brands Hatch, coming in due course (along with many more tracks and cars).The key now is to intoduce good community aspects into it's UI, and a multiplayer experience that pushes the boat - not just a bland server list where to be in the know you have to join fragmented leagues in multiple forums all over the world. It should all be handled in the user interface.Assetto Corsa has the potential to bring a fragmented community together. It has the graphics, physics and interface to change the face of sim racing on the PC. Buy it and support Kunos, they seriously deserve it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								+ vehicledynamics/handling+ looks good+ sounds good+ laserscanned tracks+ nice selection of cars+ mods- AI/KI- no weather- no night- first kunos wanted to sell it as a F2P Game and you feel and see it in almost every aspect of this game (5sec penalty, no false starts, pitstops, no flagrules etc)- kunos want to get a big company so they care more about nice pressevents and nice pictures then turning this game into a real racing simulator- no longer every 2 week updates- many, many, many idiots/jerks/♥♥♥♥♥♥s/cheaters in public multiplayer- maybe a DLC nightmare in the future (3rd party paycontet already available)- almost impossible to do close door-2-door racing cause of massive microlags in multiplayer- lags in general (when the player in front of you is hard on the edge of his car - his car starts to lag/warp and you most likely crash him/you/both of you out of the race if you dont slow down and let a gap of 1-2sec between your cars)- maxed out graphics needs huge gpu performance- damagesystem in its current state is ♥♥♥♥ed up from top to bottom- overall it feels like a tuned up forza motorsport (physic) with by far less content and costumisation of your cars (i played fm3 and loved it also) (most likely cause they wanted to sell it as f2p ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ where you would have to pay a lot of real cash for a nice paint or spoiler)- Trento Bondone Hillclimb Track is a bad conversation from netcar (the devs also forbidded to mod it into the game for modders) and is by far the visual worst track and yes you can also fall out of the hole track/level into an endless flyinspin when you crash at the wrong place...like in a 0.2 version of some modtracks. I HOPE THEY FIX THIS ASAP.So is it a good game? More - then +.If you like driving/racinggames like rf,gtr,iracing and own a wheel it is definitely a must have. ATTENTION: Nordschleife will come as DLC with 10cars and is NOT INCLUDED in the release version of this game.If you more confident with a simple xbox controller then wait for project cars or stay with forza motorsport/gt.Singleplayer sucks cause of KI and limited simulation of real racing.PUBLIC Multiplayer sucks cause of many, many, many wreckers and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wannabe schumachers.Best solution is to download some hillclimb/rallytrack mods and enjoy the driving from point a to b. ALONE. Or join a racingleague for fair and hard racing (but not too close :))This is my personal opinion after 770hours of testing and driving, bugreporting and following the developement since day 1 of ea release.Cheers and have funUPDATE: now programm state is 1.1.6improved sounds: very nice, special in replays on shorter tracks. with headphones....5.1 surround sound sounds not so good aimproved graphics: good for people with 1gb vram improved tyres/physics: if you stay away from the simcade settings optimal - still benchmarkimproved multiplayer: yes, door-to-door is more possible, many options still missingimproved ki: thats the part what make me the most sick about this game. After they introduced the ki in the ea i had read a review about it in the official ac forums where the guy said that the ki is more acting like real human beings, some are aggressiv some passiv and he told his experience of his first singleplayer race. and after i tried the singleplayer mode 2 months after the release i had exact the same experience like he had when the ki was ""new"". its still impossible to do a simple trackday with different cars driven by the ki and have fun race. damn its even impossible to follow a abarth 500 train cause the ki driven ferrari behind is unable to overtake the 500 but when you overtake the ferrari he will most likely crash you instantly out of the race. whats the point of playing a racinggame where the ki is dumber then a texas instruments calculator? and the devs said in the ea phase that most players will only use singleplayer and not multiplayer so they focus more on singleplayer....ähm wtf?!?and now they splitting up the costumers into ""good dlc buyer cashcow players"" and ""bad only stock/mod content poor players"" in multiplayer....wtf?Yes the game is still in developement but where are the times when you buyed a game and it was (almost) complete and with all features players wanted and features which are also needed to say it is a simulator and not a mariokart. But no kunos said they dont want to get competion against simbin, iracing, rfactor so now you have the result. ki not working, singlepayer racing only 10 laps max....multiplayer which you also cant enjoy to its full capacity if you dont buy dlc(´s). Please Kunos stop seperating each part of you game into a calculation part to get money. If you have a full package you will get your money cause you will have a overall good product and not a thing which falls apart in every aspect when you watch it close.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								*UPDATED to .21*For me, one of the best racing sims out there. definitely recomendable. I will make a list of pros and cons (list for V0.94) so you can decide for yourself:Pros:-Best driving simulation I've ever tried, the car is so predictable that you can even go sideways playing with a mouse. Dont get me wrong, you really NEED a wheel to enjoy this game. Almost every car is easy to drive in your confort zone, try to go above it  to earn some tenths and it will become tricky before you lose the control of the car.-You get a bunch of cars (a bit of everything) and a few laser scanned circuits. We are talking of the closest to reality models you can get on a game here. More to come, the Green Hell as dlc in October I think-Mods (with dev tools soon *already released). mod apps (displays, corners performance,..),mod sound, mod tracks (one of high quality already, crappy ports too), and mod cars (soon* already released good ones: shelby cobra and gp2).-Small and friendly dev team. They ask, you answer, they give (list of wanted cars and traks) and you ask, they answer (if you have some problem)-Game modes: Im just here for the multiplayer but there is a lot of challenges, time atack mode, drift and drag mode too. *multiplayer is enjoyable already, you have some jump in and drive servers and more serious onesNow the cons:-As early access: everything works in single player, the AI needs a bit of agresivity tuning, now avoids you an doesnt defend its position. The devs have said to v1.0 there will be 2 sliders for strenth and agresivity. Multiplayer have some lacks but it was  released this friday so it will be better for sure.- you dont have a massive list of cars like lets say Project Cars-As the time writing, is not possible to have another light source than the Sun, so no night races yet. You can race from sunrise to sunset with dynamic time and stuff- Not weather yet- Car damage (visual and mechanic) is not implemented yet,  seeing the perfection of the grip simulation I'm sure it will be top-notch tho- *You will find some idiots on the multiplayer from time to time in open servers, but what multiplayer game doesnt have them? (btw i've only seen one in 150h, the rest is just lack of experience)final thoughts:If you are still reading this, buy it, you wont regret it			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Best racing sim ever.- Fantastic GFX, reflections, smoke etc etc- Cars look amazing- Engine sounds that actually get under your skin- Superb G27 support- Native tripple screen support and track IR- All cars FEEL like actual cars- Great tracks- Well optimised (apart from the smoke ;))- Decent multiplayer track days and eventsI've been playing AC for a while and it has been my go-to game for that racing buzz on the G27. No other game comes close in terms of making you feel that you are part of the car and giving you that racing buzz.My favorite racer for some time was GTR2, but it was getting a little old and tired in the looks department and it's feel. I've got a ton of racing games on various platforms and it is safe to say that AC has the best feel hands down of any.Step into the legendary 98T lotus as an example, up the boost, watch the engine strain, hear the tyres screeth and feel your car squirm as the boost comes in and you fight to keep the car facing forwards on the track, whilst meanwhile that beast of an engine sound is giving you a rush. Limit the boost to save the engine, fly into a corner too hot, try to take someone on the outside and up the boost again trying to outdrag them as you fly past and look to the left screen seeing the engine flashing red and them dropping back in your mirrors - you know you are pushing it hard and the engine won't last like that forever!Honest this game is a credit to the developers, and for anyone who thinks it doesn't have enough cars or tracks, this game is all about quality and not quantity.Now they have added the Yellowbird it is a fantastic addition. Such a tailhappy fun beast of a car to drive and drift around in.You've got your sporty production cars, tail-happy beasts such as the mighty Cobra, and limited production cars / race cars. All of the sounds are unique and the charteristics of each car make it a different game with each car you step into.Absolutely spot on, and worth it for anyone who is into their racing sims.It's worth noting that if you want to push the visuals on multi screen setups you do need a fairly hefty system though. I am running an I7 4770k under water and two GTX 780TI AMP's. I can max everything out apart from the hi-res mirror reflections and smoke needs to be turned down. I would imagine for a single screen though that somehting like one 780 would be plenty.			",62,1,1,3,5,0,1

								Let me be as frank, and honest as possible, this game is absolutely amazing, but there is a caveat.  So I did not really play racing games/sims and one day I saw Grid Autosport, and it had a really fun look to it so I picked it up and with my XBOX controller, started having fun.  The AI is terrible on that game, but in multiplayer with friends its a great time.  I enjoyed it so much, I thought, have I missed out on one of the best genres of games? So I picked up Assetto Corsa, and tried it out.  It was fun in third person view with the controller, but as I read through forums, and spoke to others I was missing out.  This is a SIMULATOR, a program DESIGNED to mimic real life driving and thus cannot be enjoyed fully with sticks and buttons, and that a wheel, no, a good wheel was going to improve my experience.  Well, for my birthday, my wife got me the G27 wheel, and my goodness, this is where this game absolutely excels.  There is nothing like it, I truly feel as though I am driving the car (to a point) and I LOVE IT!  I tried Grid with the wheel, and its not bad, not bad at all, its the difference between Outrun and getting a day at a real racing track playing AC.  There is also modding support, so if I want to drift one night, I have a some drift cars, want to drive F1, those are there, and the amount of tracks and cars provided by the community, are increasing daily.So....to sum it up, if you are looking for a game, this probably isnt for you, but if you are looking to have a real racing experience, this is where its at!

												There are a few pluses to this game: Laserscanned tracks Semi-elaborate car settings options, although I don't like the handling model (see below) The Force Feedback is nuanced and communicates well what a car is doing through the steering wheelI tried to like this game, but unfortunately it is also very lacking in many areas which severely offset the positives: AI is unaware of players and will continue their set path no matter what. Their ability to fight or defend is mediocre at best. No weather effects (rain) No nighttime racing Lacking career mode Sounds are sometimes accurate, but for the most part it's too flat. Sounds are very digital and lack in reverberation with surroundings.  Handling is not that great, I feel especially the tyre model is lacking. Obviously people will be very sensitive to this because it is supposed to be a great simulator. Unfortunately I must disagree, so I'll try to be elaborate on this one. Front tyres will not respond correctly when trailbraking, and mid-corner they do not bite (i.e. generate lateral force) as much as they should. This is very simple to showcase: try and flick the wheel left and right through the exit barriers of the Nürburgring Tourist exit; even high-downforce racing cars with proper racing tyres will barely change direction in this game, whereas I can make my silly road car on road tyres shift tyre load very easily and rapidly. This phenomenon is also visible in (record) hotlaps from the top guys on the leaderboards: even they have to coast terribly long at corner entry and mid-corner, otherwise any car in this game will just go wide. This can easily be shown by for example looking up real-life time attacks on the Nordschleife and comparing the corner speeds with those in the game. There is just no way to really push without the front tyres giving up, and that is just a shame. I tried my fair share of extreme car setups (minimum spring and damper stiffness in the front and maximum in the rear, maximum rake, etc.) just to get the front end turn, but the physics engine just does not respond accordingly. Again, this is visible in the way even the leaderboard players have to coast so much through turns.Another thing is that drifting in this game does not look natural at all; whenever the cars oversteer they continue to move as a solid body in a given direction and at the same velocity. It's not possible to make the car increase its angular velocity (i.e.: spin out) by abruptly stabbing the throttle or the brake. It is also not possible to power out the cars from corner apexes and gradually straightening the wheel. As a result, there is no chance to do controlled drifts in which cars harmoniously slide from corner to corner as if they are dancing, and certainly not with a lot of tyre smoke from spinning the rear wheels under power. Look up any video of AC drifting to see what I mean; as a result of the non-accurate handling model cars will just go from uncontrolled slide to uncontrolled slide, there is never an actual feeling that the driver is in control of the drift angle at all. What's more, this unacademic and totally disrespectful response of the developer says enough about his lack of knowledge and approach to an iterative process of improving something technical like a physics engine: http://imgur.com/a/NgYYQ This guy can't be a real engineer if he can't even handle some constructive peer reviews...But most of all: I'm especially fond of online racing, but this game has just the worst online system of any recent driving game, and I want to elaborate on this game-breaking experience that makes me regret my purchase of this incomplete game. There simply is next to no variety in online lobbies; it is always the same track and car combinations that appear, and making a custom lobby will result in a lack of players that are able to join, let alone actually join. This is due to two main reasons: Hosting an online lobby is done with a seperate dedicated server tool that imposes unnecessary restrictions on the host. First of all, a single car model with a particular colour has to be manually assigned to every player slot beforehand. There is no way of selecting one or multiple classes that are allowed, but instead there is just a list of all the car models without their specifications. Not only is it very hard to know which cars are evenly matched to each other, but it results in extremely limited choice. In practice, it is either having to deal with one-make races or a fixed varied list in which one or two cars of each model is available; for example, two Ferraris 458, two Mercedes SLS AMG, two Corvettes, etcetera. In the latter case, when a car is taken by another player, it is prohibited to drive it anymore because it belongs to the prior assigned server slot; if the two McLaren P1s are already chosen, you are out of luck and have to choose another model. The host decides which cars are available, both in type and in quantity. A ridiculous decision; this has to be the only car game in recent times that carries over this real-world restriction/scarcity into the digital world. Some people even go afk in the lobby just not to lose their virtual car in that server to another player...Furthermore, the online tool cannot be setup to cycle through multiple tracks, let alone a new set of available cars. Every change has to be done manually and servers have to be restarted with every edit, kicking all the players...The online experience is further worsened with the next point below: DLC system splits up the game into many different sub versions. In other games this is no problem because you can join all lobbies, but are just restricted to use the content that you own. Not in Assetto, where you are just denied into a server when you lack just one car or track from the list that the host setup. In practice, this leads to even less variety, because lobby leaders know that they will not get many players joining if they choose cars from several DLC packs, so it's mostly either 'vanilla game content lobbies' or 'DLC lobbies' that are available.Care for some online GT3 racing? You are forced to buy Dream Pack 2 and 3, as well as the Red Pack and lately the Porsche pack as well for the Porsche GT3 car. Want to have a supercar battle? Same problem, lobbies will probably have at least a Porsche sportscar, so you must buy any of that DLC as well as the Tripl3 Pack DLC for the Ferrari 488 GTB that inevitably is in the lobby list. If you own just the vanilla game, then forget about proper online play altogether. All in all, this game is fun if you want a semi-realistic hotlapping game, or if you are planning to buy all the DLC. Otherwise, I would definitely not recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Full opinion of Assetto Corsa:PRO:- The Most realistic simulator currently available on Steam.- Great Graphics-Engine.- Good Sounds of Cars.- The tracks are created in Laser-Scan, equal to reality in every details.- The cars interiors are gorgeous.- You can change all the parameters of the machine.- The forum Game is very popular. You can Post mod or exposing problems / bugs to developers.- Multiplayer is Fun, with various features, formed by serious people.CONTRO:-Where is the night and the rain?-Some Bug in Multiplayer.-Unable to play via keyboard.-HDR Unoptimized.-Carreer and events much passable.-There isn't Workshop.What to say? I'm Italian and I'm proud to own a simulator completely Made in Italy so damn beautiful and long-lived.If you have a steering wheel this game MUST be your in ALL THE COSTS!Who played with the keyboard ... stay away from this.One of the best simulators of all time.

												A great example of Early Access done right, Kunos was always communicating what they were working on and delivered updates frequently.As for the game itself, if you want a racing simulator, Assetto Corsa is the title you want. Period. It may not have the same eye-candy as some titles, but it delivers in the physics simulation, force feedback (use of a wheel is highly recommended), and native, FOV-correct triple-monitor support.Kunos has stated plans to continue building on AC with DLC and core updates through 2017, so even if you didn't get in on early access, there's still a great value to be had here.

												I love this game. Assetto Corsa dawns a new era of the racing simulator. Assetto Corsa is a simulator that brings the revered true-to-life racing experience to the casual gamer. This game bridges the two worlds together without losing rigidity as a racing simulator. This is a simulator that will punish you for entering a corner too fast, or giving too much gas in a corner. But at the same time it is so delightfully simplistic and intuitive that it is easily playable by almost anyone. Assetto Corsa is one of the few racing simulators that is fun, and still encourages you to make mistakes and learn from them. If you are coming from console games like Forza, or GT and are looking for something more, then this is the game for you. Assetto Corsa is truly the best racing simulator there is.  However, this game is by no means perfect. One of the biggest problems that I have for this game is the lack of awareness of speed. This leads to the driver entering the corner much too fast, and creates an inorganic driving experience. This problem is mostly notable in the interior driving view. Other reviewers have mentioned this as a flaw and it certainly is one. I found the best way to correct this is to adjust the FOV or go to either the bonnet cam or the bumper cam. If you are someone that can get used to the inside cam (where it occurs the most) then this might not be a problem for you.			",111,22,4,10,16,0,7

												I have old i5-3230M GT650M laptop.When I bought AC(ver 1.6?) it is unplayable at 720p, graphic low and more than about 8 AI cars. I mostly played practice or hot lap. But I did not complaint. The driving experience itself is good enough..Now ver 1.9, with same laptop,1080p low, 12 AI cars,  no problem!! 50~60fps!!24 AI cars reach 30~40fps at some tracks. playable!Whta a great job!Some games just want to kill your GPU..Kunos, keep up the good work!

												I am 50 years old and not much of a gamer, but enjoy simulations of all kinds, which Assetto Corsa is. They are a small group of people and do a good job listening to us. They have improved this software so much in the past year that I had to update my review.   One thing I am sure, from hearing about what others are describing about AC, is that each hardware setup (computer/wheel/screen/vr) behaves a little different.     Then of course there is the settings (comuter/wheel/software). So much can be gained or lost here.   Go through (assettocorsa ini) file and set everything to your computer/wheel.    I got Razer Cortex, which shuts down background apps and Malwarebyts, which cleaned hundreds of pups.     Download the (Anti Clipping and Fanaleds) apps for your wheel.     REFLECTIONS set down to low and static reflections set to very low, may help.    I find it harder to drive in game than a real car so be patient and be aware of your speed. 50 mph in-game still feels like 30 mph to me.   I still have to remind myself of the power I have, without any repercussions to the $500 000 car or myself/public property. I had a V8 Vega (300+ horse, curb weight 2500 pounds), could, at times, leave me shaking for the rest of the day. I could only imagine the skid mark a car like the  LeFerrari could cause in your underwear.     Assetto Corsa's physics really are incredible.  This is getting very real. Assetto Corsa is worth all the money and time.  One other thing that has me so addicted is the track and car mods.   Checking to see what is new every day is one of my favorite things to do. Just try searching Google Image ""Assetto Corsa car mod downloads"" and see for yourself.     I can't emphasize this enough. Sim guys are some of the nicest and most helpful people from all over the world.  The guy's at Assetto Corsa must love what they do and it shows.   Have fun. Paul			",3,1,14,0,0,0,0

												Assetto Corsa is a realistic racing simulation game developed by Kunos Simulazioni. In Assetto Corsa you get behind the wheel of one of many realistically recreated cars ranging from the little Abarth 500 (upgraded version of the Fiat 500) to the beast that is the Pagani Zonda R. You'll push these cars to their limits as your storm around the tracks this game has to offer including the legendary Nurburgring (part of the Dream DLC Pack 1).Before I get to the main part of my review I want to point a few things out which have had an impact on my opinion of the game. Firstly, I'm not a racing sim expert, far from it in fact, most of my racing experience comes from the arcadey side of the genre so I'm less used to the level of realism found in AC. Secondly, I played using an Xbox 360 Gamepad rather than a wheel and pedals since I don't own a wheel. Thirdly, I own the Dream DLC Pack 1 so my review will include things only available as part of the DLC. Finally, I haven't followed the game through it's development and I've only played the most recent version which is v1.1.6.+Good graphics and visual effects+A good selection of cars which are all well modeled+A good variety of tracks including a laser-scanned Nurburgring +Quite a lot to do, including: drag races, solo track practices, time trial events, race weekends a career mode and much more +Surprisingly good controls for a Gamepad+A fair amount of customisation options for the cars in regards to tuning and paint jobs+Great sound effects for the cars+All of the cars, even different versions of the same car (e.g. a production model and a GT model), feel very different which makes driving each one unique to driving the others+It's very easy to get into for beginners like myself+A huge amount of mods+Lots of info displays which you can choose to use when racing+Despite AC being out of Early Access, Kunos are planning to continue adding more and more content to the game which can never be a bad thing+AC supports Oculus as well as three monitor setups, while I personally don't make use of these I know they're important features for a lot of people+Reasonably quick load times+/-Penalties feel a little too harsh to me but perhaps that's just because I'm not a racing sim buff-The AI are pretty bad, they seem to have a path which they absolutely have to take and don't feel at all like they're actual drivers which is what you would expect from a racing game. On top of this they're also very 'timid' when it comes to overtaking and unless you go off the track chances are they'll just stay behind you for the rest of the race-While you can change the time of DAY that your race takes place at there's no night time in the game which is rather disappointing-Weather effects go no further than clear skies, clouds of fog so there's no rain which is again, rather disappointing-The soft-body physics is really bad, doesn't look at all realistic, for example driving 150mp/h into a solid wall left my bumper with some small dents and scratches-The controls which can be bound to the Gamepad are very limited, for example you can't bind pause to your Gamepad so you have to reach over to the Esc key every time you want to pause which gets frustrating very quickly-The mouse cursor is always visible on screen, one my biggest pet peevsVerdict:For regular gamers - Worth Purchasing (8/10)For Racing sim veterans - A Must Have (8.5/10)A fantastic racing sim which can be enjoyed by those new to racing sims as well as veterans of the genre, though it's far from flawless. If you have any interest in racing games I suggest you pick this one up.***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***El K.			",670,170,24,76,100,6,76

 Brief Introduction Assetto Corsa is undoubtedly one of the most popular racing simulators out there, despite all the good things and bad things from this game, I feel a bit half-half about this game.But before we get into the review lets go over what the developer had to say about Assetto CorsaOriginally posted by Devoloper of Assetto Corsa: Assetto Corsa features an advanced DirectX 11 graphics engine that recreates an immersive environment, dynamic lighthing and realistic materials and surfaces. The advanced physics engine is being designed to provide a very realistic driving experience, including features and aspects of real cars, never seen on any other racing simulator such as tyre flat spots, heat cycles including graining and blistering, very advanced aerodynamic simulation with active movable aerodynamics parts controlled in real time by telemetry input channels, hybrid systems with KERS (Kinetic energy recovery system) and energy recovery simulation. Extremely detailed with single player and multiplayer options, exclusive licensed cars reproduced with the best accuracy possible, thanks to the official cooperation of Car Manufacturers.  What I think about the Game  Pros… As a proper car simulator, I think you should be able to feel every little bit of the road, and with Assetto Corsa, you’re able to get that. The actual physics of this game is magnificent with a force-feedback wheel, this is achievable. With a decent wheel and pedal system, you are able to feel the understeer, the oversteer, even little bumps in the road – this means that you can feel it build up, and you know when you’re going to lose it. In this whole simulator aspect, I think this beats out its competitors, such as Project Cars. Despite losing out on graphics to Project Cars, it makes up in terms of physics and overall “realism” to the driving experience. The details put into the exterior and interior of cars, even moving parts of cars is phenomenal as well. As of the Japanese car pack, Assetto Corsa dives in and out of different car pop culture, whether you're on the touge tracks of Japan to the sweeping curves of Eau Rouge (Spa). To say the least, most other PC ""simulators"" only offer one or two cars per each region but Assetto Corsa hits the nail in the head in terms of variety. and Cons Being given this great first impression of realism makes me so reluctant to criticize this game, but once I dug deeper into my hundreds of hours of Assetto Corsa, these small missing details of a racing simulator starts to bother me more and more. Weather effects aren’t available in this game, like driving in the rain, and I think that as a racing simulator, it’s a must have. The AI isn’t that good, but neither is the AI in its competitors. Thus flags are a thing, but no marshals? Pit stops too, where are they in single player  is the realism in them?  It’s not like they don’t have it in motorsports. Where the crew changing your tires?  Where are your car jackers?  Where are your post-race celebrations? C’mon and you still call this a racing simulator. I want to see yellow flags going up when there are crashes half way around the circuit, I want marshals to be waving the blue flag so I can go “Hey Dan, go ♥♥♥♥ yourself because you’re♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I want the full enjoyment of your pit-crew working on your car. Developers, wake up, you might as well call them “Need for Speed: On the Track”. All the Assetto boiz are going to dislike this but it’s the truth. Overall Thoughts It’s a great simulator, great handling, great experience, but has way more things to improve on. If you’re going to label your game a “simulator”, don’t give us something half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and something that’s not complete.  Conclussion? Yes, despite all the downsides of the game, I think it's one of the best racing games, let alone racing simulators out there. But developers, get off your asses and do something about it. (If you found the review helpful, giving it a thumbs up would be nice!) If you're looking for more Steam Friends? Look no more - feel free to add me! Thus, hit me up if you want to play Assetto Corsa with meEdit1: A few gramatical errors.Edit2: Thanks @Inbekannt - pitstops are a thing now in Assetto Corsa, adjustments made to the reviewEdit3: Change to the review as of the implementation of the Japanese Car PackEdit4: Thanks @Boogle. silly vocabulary error.

												Having spent 500+ hours in the last 2.5 years, I can say this is easily the best racing game ever and a true successor to the GTR2 category. It is irritatingly realistic, requires a lot of practise and epic patience to get your laps right and comes closest to the real thing. Earlier versions had optimisation issues but now, Assetto Corsa is a charm and is a must-have for all car guys/racing fans. There is a sense of achievement when you get your laps/setups right.Pros-1. Physics are bang-on perfect! If you are looking for realism, this is as real as it can get!It has reached a point where its painfully real. For example- You set your toes and cambers to tune the cornering, it affects the temperatues (inside,outside and mid tread of tyre gets different temp) and the suspension reactions. You then fine tune the suspension which affects your previous toes/cambers. But mid-way you realise your height, spoilers, Anti-roll bars and spring stiffenss need adjustment which you are able to perfect but when you run a lap.... It has all went to waste because the last update (while being brilliant) offsets something else completely ruining your whole life.No corner is as easy as brakes, steer, accelerate out... You've to be aware about the tyre loading, temperatues, current fuel load and age of tyre before deciding on that ever-fluctuating time to brake and to steer.2. A huge array of cars and tracks. Fulfills every guy/girl/helicopter's need in terms of car choice- hatchbacks, small sports cars, japanese sports cars (the only DLC I refuse to buy), sedans, SUVs, vintage cars, vintage legends, supercars, hypercars, GT4, GT3, GT2 and F1. And believe me, each one of it has a completely different character and satisfies when you get it right. Tracks, I agree are just about enough but can seem limited at times. Solution? Download more through various concerned sites.3. Brilliant community support- A lot of fantastic mods are available, which are very welcome by the mod-friendly nature of the game. In addition, there are lots of racing leagues being organised very professionally by players (very much like iRacing).4. Very affordable pricing of the product! Even the DLC are completely affordable for even college students. I feel the 'Value for Money' factor is off the charts for Assetto Corsa.Cons-1. Career mode starts off from the basic hatchbacks races and progresses upto the Formula/GT series in a very slow fashion. Whilst, from a real life career POV is very real, gets really boring in 2-3 hours. I found it boring to establish expertise on FWD hatchbacks but it definitely helps you understand the basics of driving a car fast. This progression gives you the feeling of differences in street vs race cars.2. Engine sounds has always been a weakness of Assetto Corsa, which has improved upto a certain extent, yet still not on par with other racing games in the market. Solution? Mods! Available sound mods are simply brilliant and eradicate this issue completely. (Google ""Fonsecker"" if you want a jump start on sound mods)In competition-Assetto Corsa makes Codemasters' Formula 1 look as real as Mario Kart. Project cars which is 5 times as costly to buy (incl DLC) doesn't come anyway near in terms of realism; and Assetto Corsa doesn't come near PGC in terms of graphics. iRacing is the only real competitor to AC but loses out on pricing, that thing is damn expensive. NFS,drive,forza etc etc aren't in this league so no use comparing.All in all, just buy the game already, if you ready to learn racing from the ground up (even though you have won championships before), and if you have a lot of patience. There is nothing like Assetto Corsa. It is a step ahead of every other game else.			",106,3,1,6,8,0,2

												if you want a true to life simulator of car dynamics and car physics then this is your game.if you want a simulator that perfectly captures each car's individual driving and handling feel as well as each car's individual engine note, this is your game.if you want a simulator that accurately models drivetrains, this is your game.AC with the bonus pack and both dream packs is an absolutely brilliant game, and with the 1.3 update brings new improved tyre models and physics along with reworked sound and some more polishing. cars feel incredibly planted with new tyre modeling (as should be the case on semi-slicks and slicks) and gain of grip/loss of grip works perfectly. it will only get better, and better. really the only thing that needs to be added is laserscan sebring and laguna seca along with a polished fully fledge career mode and its a 10/10 game. as of now its 9/10buy with confidence			",116,4,15,14,11,2,8

												Went racing in September last year trying to go drifting. Failed miserably.Friend told me about how far racing steering wheels for games had come and how good everything was.Hadnt touched one since Colin McRae Rally on Playstation 1.Googled 'best drifting simulator' found Assetto Corsa. Sold spare set of wheels for race car, bought Logitech G92, game and graphics card for PC in December.Done nothing but sweet sweet Skids until Janurary. Got bored, discovered user created content and online play. Now I tandem with teams on small Japanese racetracks in LSX powered Silvias.Went back out on track in February, Killed it drifting.11/10 havent even tried to drive a normal car.			",13,0,1,0,3,0,4

Early Access Review
								Did you ever drive a Ferrari in a racing game before? Of course you did, plenty of games in the past had Ferraris in their repertoire but the FERRARI 458 ITALIA in AC feels for me actually the very first time to drive one of these hot beautys. Easily playable with a thumbstick controller if you don`t have a proper wheel ready in your pocket.At the moment Assetto Corsa is in Beta which means it is a giant Tech Demo without the upcoming career mode, multiplayer and has no AI and physical damage yet but the AAA graphics (laser scanned tracks!), great handling and outstanding  sounds/effects makes me believe that we have here one of the best Driving Simulators coming up for a discount price till it`s release probably in 2014. Here you have Life for Speed, rFactor and iRacing mixed together to an excellent and amazing racing game. This game is simply superb! Not only for sim fans :)			",4474,1837,198,505,741,64,694

Early Access Review
								This is my first Steam review; I hadn't felt much inclined to really write one before now, but after 100+ hours on Assetto Corsa I feel compelled to. I'm definitely a car game enthusiast, and Assetto Corsa is the best racing simulation I have ever played. No other game, in my opinion, comes close to conveying such a sense of how it really must feel to drive these cars. Assetto Corsa has nice graphics and sounds, but it's the laser scanned tracks and an advanced physics model that really set it apart. To provide specific ideas as to what this means, weight transfer is beautifully conveyed, the way the cars behave makes sense, and you are driving on surfaces that virtually exactly match reality. Something I really enjoyed for example was how the same cars handling varies with tyre choice. Take a street tyre for example, you will feel the tyre roll and the car slide relatively easily and quite predictably. Put on a racing compound however and you now feel the car chassis working harder, and when the grip does give out the slide is much more dramatic and less easy to control. There is huge depth and many hours to enjoy exploring such aspects, without it ever becoming frustrating or unintuitive. Assetto Corsa is still 'early access' as I write this, but there is already a promising and welcoming community, and plenty of good content, with more coming in the form of additional manufacturer and track licenses. This is a must have for any driving enthusiasts game library.			",76,6,13,5,14,0,12

												It's difficult to write a review for Assetto Corsa as it means you need to think about the game and thinking about the game just makes me want to play it right away. Assetto Corsa. This is a simulation game and the learning curve reflects that, you learn to drive each car as they're all very different.There's a great selection of cars and a good selection of tracks with quite a lot more to come from the Assetto Corsa team.Visually the game is stunning, the level of detail both inside and out of the vehicles is truely wonderful. The tracks look realistic and there's isn't this over exposed lighting or over the top effects that you see in a lot of so called simulation racing games.  The enviroments in Assetto Corsa  look clean, crisp and believable.  There's the option to enter photo mode and mess around with the direction of the sun, field of view, focus levels, light levels and some pre-set filters, it's well executed and gives you the chance to get the perfect screenshot. The tracks are laser scanned for that ever so more realistic driving simulation, this applies to the ""Next Generation"" tracks but not the ""Historic"" ones. The physics engine is great, it acts how you would expect it to and every curb and bump on the track has a direct affect on your car. The force feed back is amazing, it lets you know exactly how your car is handling and it all adds up to an immersive racing simulation that brings a smile to your face. In Assetto Corsa you go from sliding off the track at every corner to setting decent lap times, pushing yourself that bit more each lap and it's a very rewarding experience. There's a ton of game options ranging from practice, challenges, race, online and all with sub categories.With enough driving assist options for any level of player, full traction control, full anti-locking brakes, 100% stability control and all adjustable from full to completely off. As you would expect for a PC game there's enough visual options so you can get the frame rates set to what suits you best.I use a R7 265 2GB graphics card and never dipped below 65FPS, 1080P with a custom settings, anti-aliasing x2, anisotropic filtering x8 and high to maximum details, so I would say this game is very well optimised.There's full key mapping for keyboard, steering wheel, pedals and xbox 360 controllers. I would recommend a steering wheel with force feed back as it's so much better. The main menu system is fast and easy to use. The menu system when you're driving is great, you can a choose a huge amount of options ranging from gear indicator to suspension physics and you have the option to drag them and place them where you would like.I feel overall the sounds in this game are very nice, there are a few cars which sound too digital to me but I've never driven them so it would be unfair to judge. The A.I for me is pretty good, there's been a few tweaks to make them better and with the original Assetto Corsa content (Not mods) the A.I does a great job of doing consistent lap times as well as being smart enough to avoid crashing and give a good challenging driving experience. Even at 80% difficulty which is there lowest setting they are pretty fast. The modding community is on fire with this game, obviously some mods are poorly done but there's also some that are on par with what the Assetto Corsa development team have created and that's saying a lot because they do superb work. Cars, tracks, textures, Ui, there's pretty much a mod out there for everything. There's still a few issues with this game that need to be addressed in order to make it the full on simulation game. Pit stops only work in multi player and still need to be tweaked, there's no flag system yet but there is small mod for it and the penalty system is really awful and needs to be removed and rethought. The option for weather and night time driving would be a great touch but it's not something that's game breaking.9/10. Grazie Kunos Simulazioni, Grande lavoro.			",82,7,6,10,14,0,10

												Assetto Corsa is, to me, the shell of a perfect racing game, and with more time and money I can see it being a truly incredible product.The physics, handling, track quality and as such, general racing immersion of AC is a level above other racing titles like Forza, Gran Turismo, or Project Cars. RFactor may offer better physics, I haven't tried it.AC may be behind some of the above on graphics and AI, and is definitely behind Forza and GT on car and track selection, and the depth of the career mode.So you have to figure out what you want in a game, due you want fidelity to real life, with accurate simulation of each car, precise aerodynamic and drivetrain calculations and laser scanned tracks, or do you want to be able to drift around corners without sacrificing lap times? Do you want a false sensation of speed, or an accurate introduction to cornering and car weight distribution? Do you want top level AI and reward intensive career progression, or are you happy endlessly lapping empty tracks, looking for slight improvements in your cornering technique.I much prefer the later, but I don't mean to disparage those who enjoy the former. I've spent my last 30hrs in game lapping one track (Zandvoort in the Netherlands), with one car (the McLaren 650S GT3) and the experience has been hugely enjoyable as I try to approach race car driver speeds (which I'm sure I'm far off, currently only the 5th fastest on RSR for that combination). The feel of laser scanned track through the force feedback is incredible, the handling dynamics superb and the complexity and precision of high-speed racing is endlessly fascinating to me.If you want to genuinely feel the sensation of racing a well modelled 458, or a McLaren P1, or a GT3 or F1 car through Spa, or the Nurnburgring, this is a near perfect way to do it (short of somehow renting one!)If you're a fan of driving, buy AC and invest in developing technique. If you're a fan of arcade style multiplayer, or the quick fun of frantic drifting buy something else.Highly recommended, from someone looking forward to the new car releases in May and June. If they can add some American and Japanese tracks, expand the list of road cars, continue to tinker with the AI, and maybe, eventually, develop a solid career mode, then this will be a perfect racing game.

												DISCLAMER! This review is based on my experience using a Xbox controller. (63 hours so far)Graphics (car): Very detailed.Graphics (environment): Not great but passable and enjoyable. Performance: Runs great on i7 4790k + 970 (80FPS+ on high setting)Sound: Let this speak for itself (youtube) Force feedback (controller): Even with a controller I have sense of control on how my car behaves on the road.""Damage"": The physics isn't great when you bump into things it feels like playing bumper cars. (youtube) and the car damage are mostly scratches.Single player + AI: Single player is great and with many challenging modes. However, when you are racing against AI they will pretend not to see you and hit you.Multiplayer: The community is awesome. Everyone wants to race but every now and then someone will try to ram you on purpose.Multiplayer (server browser/host): Easy to host but no steam integration. Expect a lot of EU servers. DLC: Might seem overpriced at first but completely worth. Tons of high quality cars and tracks.Overall, great sandbox racing simulator.			",498,145,15,64,46,4,54

It brings new vehicles, maps and a completely overhauled sound system as well as better vehicle damage, better mechanics and handling, overall the game feels ""miles"" better compared to the previous versions! Well done Kunos. ohh and career mode is now availible to play... this game is honestly a steal, for the price to content ration!TLDR: Everything that could have been improved, was improved......Edit: AC is no longer in ""early access"", more career missions have been released to further the game aswell as tweaked mechanics on some vehicles, and a hint at future licensed vehicles to come.Every corner in the game you take, you always get a shot of adrenaline, you can never know if you are going to fast that you might spin out, or just that perfect speed that would end up giving you a an advantage on your ever soo close opponent that is trailing right behind you.

												After spending 150 hours in Project Cars, I decided to buy this.. so this is more of a comparison than a review.. or both? The first thing I noticed was how much different the FFB feels. It's difficult to explain, but I'll try. It feels much closer to driving a real car. There's a wider ""soft zone"" than in PCars, as PCars tends to feel fairly stiff even with the smallest movements. You can turn down FFB strength on PCars to compensate, but this makes some of the more dramatic turns feel ""off"" or too weak. Assetto Corsa gives a more balanced and dynamic feeling throughout the various turn radiuses. You also feel everything on the road to the slightest detail and the laser scanned tracks add even more detail to this. (Also the grass actually feels like grass, sand like sand, and your car slides appropriately! In PCars the grass is like quick sand.) Overall, it just feels right.The car handling and physics also feel more akin to a real vehicle. Because of this, I found the driving more intuitive and found myself making more consistent laps. The game feels much more stable as well. I haven't encountered any bugs and even in VR it runs silky smooth. PCars can be pretty glitchy and unreliable, both in the physics and sound.. making it pretty frustrating sometimes. Drifting of course is far better in Assetto Corsa, (not even comparable, honestly) which is what I'm going to spend most of my time doing personally. I don't really see much point of going back and playing PCars other than to play with a friend who doesn't own this game. My only gripe is that I can't tune my vehicles to the precision I'd like, this may be a misunderstanding on my part because I've seen videos of people tuning (for example) their toe out to 1. (Maybe an update took this out?) I can only do increments of 5 or 10 with the same vehicle. If there's a way to choose any number, please let me know.			",304,36,7,30,24,1,16

												From the outset I would just like to say I do own Project Cars and have at the time of writing 630+ hours but only 16 hours of Assetto Corsa (Just bought it).People say that AC's more accurate physics simulation over pCars features and looks makes it the better purchase but I beleive that some compromise between AC and pCars would make for a more rounded and enjoyable simulation-bPhysicsIMO the physics of Assetto Corsa tend to lean quite heavily on understeer (much like Grand Turismo) and pCars on oversteer. It feels as though every car wants to understeer... but the result of this is that Assetto Corsa rewards you more for precise and smooth driving whereas pCars you can generally chuck the car around and achieve ridiculous lap-times.In terms of braking I managed to get the settings at a somewhat decent level but the fact that you cannot adjust brake pressure (or disk size) is quite debilitating. The braking quite often feels... mushy-mushy-mushy-FULL LOCK and so you are severly punished for not using ABS (which at factory level is simulated quite well). pCars on the other hand better handles progressive braking however it's too rare that you lock your wheels (which is unrealistic). Assetto Corsa though does a better job at simulating the impact of flat-spotting your tires.The default setup on AC seems to be heavily biased towards the front brakes and so you will almost always lock the fronts rather than the rears. But I immediately noticed in AC I felt way more comfortable trail-braking than in pCars.In pCars I felt I had a better idea of what needed to be changed in the setup in order to drive faster or smoother whereas with AC you can't really see or feel the difference in two setups you can only judge them by laptimes. AC doesn't quite have the level of detail when it comes to tuning your cars and the impact seems less emphasised.FFBThis has been constantly praised as far better than pCars but it is hard to describe why because it is based on feeling. As with pCars the default FFB isn't great and so it will take a short while to get it to feel how you want but AC has a great custom app that will adjust the FFB strength on a per car basis on the fly. AC also has the advantage that you can creat a .lut curve to adjust the linearity of your wheels motor. pCars however has a greater range of options for FFB which can be a blessing and a curse. When I first started playing AC I couldn't shake the idea that something was missing in the feel through FFB and it took me a while but I realised it was the body of the car. pCars feels as though you have the road-->tires-->springs/suspension-->steering wheel whereas AC seems to skip the springs part. The result is you feel a disconnect between you and the car and the game ends up feeling clinical. You also don't visually see any roll in the body of the car (more later).UndersteerIn terms of understeer you can add the enhanced understeer option which is a great indicator through the FFB but I feel that it hampers your ability to try and correct and at times the understeer feels like your set in it. You can turn that feature off though and understeer is pretty much the same as pCars. OversteerOversteer on the other hand is completely different. with pCars you can sometimes feel locked into a spin and correcting it is almost impossible whereas AC the oversteer is more progressive and you can feel the different stages of slip and you can correct it far easier and it feels more intuitive getting the car back straightened out.BrakingAC does a better job of brake rumble and you can feel more accurately when the wheels are locking up and so you can adjust your braking. In comparison pCars you only know when you've locked up your wheels when you try to steer and nothing happens (except in an open-wheeler where you can tell by looking .)AccelerationThis might come up again later but I feel as though pCars gives you a better sense through FFB of acceleration effects so even if you weren't looking you could better tell whether you are going quickly or slowly.Track SurfaceIMO the differences aren't that significant but I do feel that pCars has overdone the bumps a little whereas AC is a little more subtle and realistic but then again pCars the feel of the bumps differs based on springs and dampers whereas I haven't yet detected that in AC.VisualsThis one should be quite quick, it is more of a subjective category but I do feel pCars looks so much better and specifically more involving.In terms of the track pCars has AC licked it feels better seeing the trees and waving flags but a pretty track does not a good sim make.The cars in AC from the inside feel fake and a bit two dimensional, they have nothing on pCars and look only slightly better than something Codemasters would do which is a little disappointing because they have Ferrari and Lamborghini. The result of this is you start to feel detached (a word that keeps coming) from the game and more like a casual observer rather than feeling as though you are in the car. [I will say that I do not have VR and that is probably going to render the previous sentence moot]The outside of the  car is really no better, they look arcade-y and again it's not such a big deal but with cool brands in the game it is a little bit of a let down.One thing I find quite important is the camera shake and movement (especially look to apex) I think this is something AC definitely needs to work on as pCars gets it right and AC is too sterile resulting in you not feeling the speed of the car you are driving. In pCars you get a sense of rush and anticipation when trying to spot the braking zone because everything is speeding past you so quickly. In AC you can only really get an idea of your speed by looking at the speedometer.ContentCarsThis one is a little more tough. pCars has many more tracks and Cars by default and so the range is a little more extensive and I imagine when pCars2 comes out this divide will only grow larger. However, AC has those exclusive cars like Ferrari, Lamborghini, Fiat and Alfa Romeo (which Jeremy Clarkson says is the ultimate Petrol head's car maker.) and most importantly I think Lotus road cars.AC tends to lean more on road cars (like Grand Turismo) but I think pCars has a better more vast selection of Race Class Vehicles.TrackspCars has more tracks for sure and has more of the race tracks we all know quite well but I don't think it has more or less variety than AC in terms of the type of tracks. AC does however have a nice drift playground.The most important thing in terms of content though is that AC is far easier to mod and so there is a literal boatload of Cars and Tracks you can download. Again this needs to be taken with a pinch of salt as the quality of the mods are not all that great where as if you get MDMT's modded vehicles for PCars; the quality is absolutely mind-blowing for a mod (but they take a while to make).FeaturesBoth have career modes done differently - AC is more like Grand Turismo the careers are a mix of challenges and races whereas pCars simulates a drivers journey through the ranks with race contracts offered based on performance in your class. I much prefer practice (QRW) on pCars as you can drive a setup and pop into the pits with your tires still warm and grab a bit more fuel and that creates more motivation for longevity during practice mode. AC has a quite disappointing pit system.ConclusionI recommend both this and pCars the choice is up to you, do you need to own both? No. Should you buy both? I say yes.Overall my impression is that AC is more accurate but far less involving and exciting. AC can feel a bit bland in regards to content and overall feel. Buy AC to hone your racing skills but buy pCars to have fun.			",31,1,9,0,12,0,0

												I was a GTR, GTR2, GTR 2 Power and Glory mod, rFactor, rFactor 2 kind of guy. After watching the alpha previews of Assetto Corsa back in the day, I was skeptical about the sim. I had my rFactor 2 pride and was proud to be on rF2. After a considerable number of months later, I picked up Assetto Corsa... I kind of got tired of the slow development of rF2 and wanted to try something different. It took many hours of fine tuning my FFB and learning the good mods from the bad mods. The cars at first seemed so much easier to master than in rF2. After many updates later, Assetto Corsa improved the physics, optimized the graphics, and continued to develop new and different class cars; all of which has enhanced my experience with the sim.Assetto Corsa is my go to racing sim. The sound can always use some improvement, but overall, the total experience is very pleasing. Furthermore, the modding community is HUGE, and there is always something new to try or fall in love with. Back in the day, the Lambo Miura was a fantastic mod, and then it became a part of the official car list.  The mods such as  the Mazda 787B continues to impress me, the Virtua Simulazoni cars, the IER cars, the Rally Legend Cars, and all the fantastic tracks make this sim almost priceless.I have uninstalled all other racing games and now focus solely on Assetto Corsa. If I am not racing, then I am most likely cruising on Lake Louise or Nordschleife in the Miura, Countach, GT40, Shelby Cobra, RUF Yellowbird, and when I want to speed around Tokyo city on the c1 Shuto Expressway I drive the JDM pack cars. There is a little bit of heaven for everyone in Assetto Corsa, just my review...			",108,10,32,5,23,2,9

Early Access Review
								Although this simulator is still only in its Beta stage (0.6.2 at the time of writing), the body of work that this small Italian game developer, Kunos Simulazioni, has managed to produce is truly breath taking, especially when you consider just how small they are. I'm talking 10 people: small, and with heaps more mouth watering content on the way with bi-weekly updates in the lead up to the full release of v1.0, Assetto Corsa has the potential to become the best racing simulator ever produced. Physics:Kunos have spent countless hours on developing and refining the physics engine to produce the most realistic driving experience that money can buy. Using sensors on various places on real world cars, they can accurately replicate the technical sides of the car. They're also receiving feedback from real professional racing drivers as to how particular cars handle on certain tracks. Which leads me on to tracks. Kunos are using laser scanning technology, so every bump, camber and curb will be near enough identical to their real world counterparts. There are the odd glitch or two with sticky curbs and such, but this is to be expected with this being still a relatively early build, and will thus be ironed out. ... Oh yeah, did I mention that they're releasing a laserscanned version of the Nordschliefe in September? Because they're doing that... Yeah. Anyone who knows anything about motorsport or sim racing should know how big of a deal this is, because it's never been done before by any gaming company... Ever. Graphics:The visuals are pretty decent. There are some situations where it doesn't look that great; with jagged edges and a few poorly textured surfaces, and other times where the game looks absolutely stunning. The game gives great ""bang for your buck"", in that you don't need a $100,000 super computer to play it, and still have a great looking game (**Cough**Project CARS **Cough**).  In fact even when some of the settings are set to ""low"", it still looks good.  For example, the cube map resolution takes a massive chunk of performance if you have it set to ""high"", but on ""medium"" or ""low"" it still looks brilliant and you get a huge boost in FPS. Audio:The sounds, like the graphics are also really good. I'd say they're probably second best behind Race Room: Racing Experience. As with the physics, Kunos have tried to accurately represent how each car sounds with microphones and various other pickups to get each car to sound very distinct. They've also managed to implement backfiring and overrun gurgling, which is a first that I've encountered, and it is joyous. Whether it be the whirring turbo of the KTM X-Bow, or the completely bonkers twin-turbocharged V8 in the Ferrari F40 (which quite frankly is just a scary car to drive), this is some of the best sounding cars I've ever heard in a video game. Although the BMW Z4 GT3 isn't quite right, as it's slightly too high pitched and needs a deeper gargling growl that the BMW cars tend to have. Final Take: Physics: 9/10 Graphics: 7.5/10Audio: 8/10 Kunos have created a beast. And when multiplayer drops, watch out iRacing, these boys are coming for you.			",11,0,8,1,2,1,1

												My story:I think one of the first things that people ask about this game is do you need a wheel to play it. I can say that no you dont need one to enjoy the game; however, having one brings a whole new level of depth to playing it. I started out playing this game on a keyboard, that's right a keyboard, and there was not a second that i did not enjoy it. Then i switched to a controller and the game got even better. Faster laps, more precision, the game just became a ton of fun.Recently i was privileged to try the game on a wheel and i can thoroughly say that this game is as authentic as it can get as far as the driving experience in a video game is concerned.Edit: I've now put a couple hundred hours in with my own wheel and I think the most memorable moment from that entire time is when I first plugged in my own wheel and ran my car off a curb. I was in awe, it felt like I had actually just driven off a curb. The force Feedback is insanely accurate.Let's talk about graphics:Sure this game doesnt have amazing graphics where your wheel is gonna go in a different direction than the car, but that isnt something that you need to notice because after about 2 minutes in a car you are immersed in how your car handles and how fast you need to take the next corner. Also when you're going by the trees at lets say 250kmh there really isnt time to look at them :P As far as the tracks are concerned they are phenomenal, lazer scanning is such a huge plus and they're going back to update some of the original tracks.DLC:THEY HAVE A PORSCHE PARTNERSHIP, 12 Years away from any serious racing simulators and this company got it. If that doesn't speak for this country i'm not sure what does. Sure it's a little extra but its so worth it, i mean the DLC is priced incredibly well less than $10 per pack that comes loaded with content.. All three of the dream packs are stunning and they give free content along with the update, and i dont really know of any other company that gives anything away for free. This company has just as much passion as many of the people that play the game. They are currently striving to include some of the most iconic vehicles and tracks out there.Mods:There are countless mods for this game and although not all of them are the best there are some REALLY good ones out there that are on par with Kunos' content.Multiplayer: People complain about the AI a lot, but let's be honest if you're racing the AI you shouldnt even buy this game. This game was built for an online experience and with over 800 servers up 24/7 there is always one that you can find with tons of people, or you can find an empty one for you and your friends to race on. It's also very easy to host your own server from your computer, the game comes with the files to make managing what content you want on it so easy. Theres always a server for whatever mood youre in.THERE ARE SERVERS WITH DRIVER RANKINGS SO YOU DONT HAVE TO DEAL WITH TROLLSI say that in caps because a lot of people complain about that, but it really isnt an issue. Those people are just butthurt.I 100% recommend this game, it's a whole lot of fun even if you dont have a wheel. A controller at least is a good point to start with. A keyboard is doable but it takes a lot of time and finger cramping. Hope this was helpful :D			",59,2,6,0,10,0,6

												First off, the game is amazing. I got this game when it was in early stages, and purchased all the dream packs that there were; I think the total cost for everything at the time was like 60 bucks. Although now you can get the base game with like 20 cars or something like that included with your 30 bucks. Okay, now let me talk about the pros and cons.  Pros:  Amazing Graphics Amazing Cars (Whether You Get The Dream Packs or Not) Supports The Rift and Vive for VR Supports 4k, Multi Monitors, and Gaming Chairs Amazing Simulation Works Great With G27 Force Feed Back Wheel Car Tweeking And of Course Much More for You to Find Out Cons: Very Expensive With all the Dream Packs Not Many Different Seasons and Forms of Precipitation Single Player is Limited but Still Fun And not Much More     Hope fully you thought my review was helpful, definitely hit the thumbs up on the helpful icon...Thanks:)     Also Im open to Friend requests btw...

Posted: September 10, 2015
												I've taken 2 years to finally write a proper review of Assetto Corsa, to try to like it and write a positive review. But I've been let down, so there goes a thumbs-down review.Assetto Corsa came out almost 3 years ago as an Early Access release for a reasonable price taking into account the amount of bugs, lack of content and everything that an uncompleted game brings. The title got a quick nice response from users for its remarkably detailed physics and the absolutely superb work on cars and tracks modelling, being the tracks laser-scanned. Another positive point well welcomed by the community is the full mod compatibility, which extends the possibilities of the game in terms of content and personalisation to amazement. Kunos though are a very small developing team which has worked so hard to release new tracks and circuits, all of them officially licensed by brands, and refined the game architecture to add capabilities, fix bugs and improve and optimize graphics and performance. All this work is released slowly, drop by drop, long time between, but at least they release it.This year though they decided to get the game out of Early Access, and with a nice full-price tag of double the initial price. The game itself works smoothly, quite well optimised (don't trust the minimum GTX460 required, you can run it with a GT540 easily) and with full compatibility with any wheel or pad. Where's the problem then?As said before, the amount of content is alarmingly low. After some years the number of cars and tracks hasn't increased much and the variety isn't quite wide really. You have the full Lotus catalogue and most Ferraris, and then a few other cars like a McLaren MP4/12C and its GT3 version and some other road cars. Don't misunderstand me, having such fleet of Ferraris and some of the fasterst road cars is rather coool. But the problem is that they end up being all the same. All the Lotus cars are similar, Lotus cars are similar to some other featured cars, Ferraris are similar to the other high performance cars... After all, you have an acceptable amount of models, but you can summarise them in a few. There isn't a car that outstands among the others, or different types of cars like go-karts or more motorsport disciplines. In fact, you can differentiate 4 categories: F1 cars, Supersports cars, Sportscars and Abarth. I've driven every single car released and it's like that. Despite that, with the first non-beta release a DLC came out, which adds the Nordschleife and ten cars, which again you can summarise in 4 new real additions. And for a price of 14,99€, right after having paid 49.99€ for a game that seriously lacks content. Unreasonable. The game is limited to hotlapping. AI is just unraceable because it will just stick to the racing line. Make a move and they'll bump into you as if your car wasn't there. Rival cars will never make a mistake nor get corner-cutting penalties, which you get every time you put a single wheel outside the tarmac and that slows you down to 50kph. Practice and Hotlap sessions are fun though, they feel as if you were actually there driving on a client run. The entire circuit for yourself, just you and your car. Actually it's fun, especially using a wheel. It ends up challenging yourself to beat your lap time, but after some laps it gets boring...Although it's been announced as out of Early Access, the game itself proves it is just the same as before. Only fully playable mode is hotlapping and you can only play on dry track and not at night. The fun part of this game is pushing against the clock to beat your lap times, but if you can only race in the same weather and light conditions the challenging aspect of the game is lost as soon as you have lapped a few times every circuit.Online was released in mid Early Access and it was reasonable and justified that it didn't work at all. Later updates made it more stable and raceable, but nowhere near from easy to use. It worked with a ""booking"" system. There's a server list with the race info (players, ping, track and cars allowed). Those which are post/pre-race are open for around 5 minutes for people to join by ""booking"" an entry on the race. There's not even a matchmaking room, you just click the ""booking"" button and wait 5 minutes to play, although most times when the countdown ended the server would just crash and force you to book again. If you manage to enter a race room, it is most of the times empty.Bad part of this is that despite being claimed ""1.0 version, full release"" the multiplayer keeps just the same.Mods are more or less easy to find. There are portals and forums which have the Mods and Download sections and uploaders generally have a decent knowledge on the matter, so their work is usually nice although don't expect to find everything you're looking for because most of the mods get banned for copyright and licensing. The game though isn't very respectful with mods. After an update you may find that none of the mods you downloaded are compatible, and as they're mods they don't auto-update. Annoying stuff if you have a large collection of mods.In the technical aspect, Assetto Corsa is close to brilliant. It may not have rainy weather, or night racing, or a proper damage system, or headlights that actually work or breathtaking graphics effects, but the attention to physics has no rival. Aero effects, weight balance, force feedback... Absolutely amazing. If we take a look at updates changelogs, most of the updates have to do with these things. Handling then will be completely realistic, tricky as it should be.It is not at all playable with gamepad though, but this game is a simulator so it's rather ""dumb"" to play with anything different from a wheel, which works perfectly once set up. The base is solid and really promising, but the lack of content is a fact to consider. Not only that, the gameplay is limited and lacks basic functions. I don't want to compare this game with another one because it's not fair and every game is different on it's own, but Assetto Corsa isn't the best option for a race simulator right now. I'd say it's better to wait until more content is released, but I've done that for a long time and it's becoming hopeless. It's not fair to double the price of the game when it has almost the same things that you had when it was Early Access. Not to mention the DLC...*PATCH EDIT*2 more DLC...4.5/10			",81,10,13,2,6,1,3

												Assetto Corsa is probably one of the best, if not THE best circuit racing simulator out there right now. If you have a good wheel and want to feel like you're actually racing exotic racecars on a track, this game is the best one out there.  Pro: -Great Graphics-Good Variety of cars-Mod support-Great community-Playing Online-Physics Cons:-Bad AI-Buggy (Couldn't play single player for a good month because of a bug)-Not enough content for the price-Could be better optimized			",149,20,13,7,16,2,16

Early Access Review
								When I looked at AC, I was unsure if it would be for me. I liked the idea of a racing sim, but I came from the F1 201x, GT5/6 games on the PS3 so was unsure if it would be too technical for my liking....and frankly too hard.Well, I'm so glad I bought it.  I initially got the Technology Preview for buying NetKar Pro for a few quid, but the early access was far more fun than I thought it would be.  The game has constantly been developed by Kunos with regular updates (every 2 weeks) and now multiplayer is out it's made it even better.  I started with a DFGT but purchased the T500RS and TH8 shifter just for AC. It was a good investment in my eyes as it brings the cars to life.  The Lotus 49 around Monza 66 is my favourite, and it's such a beast to handle - but great fun in trying!Handling - This blows any console game out of the water. I bought Race 07 and that doesn't come close to AC.  I haven't been able to try pCars.  The FFB is superb, and I can only hope they continue to improve this. If you have cold tires with a heavy fuel load, you really notice the difference in turn 1 compared to low fuel warm tire runs.Sound - This could be better.....and will be!  AC recently mentioned they will use a new audio method for a better experience.  It's still pretty good as it is, I can't complain as I still think it's good.Cars - Whilst there are a lot less cars to other games out there, it takes so much time to get really good with the cars I just don't care. There are some car's I've hardly driven as other cars get me hooked.Tracks - The bumps in the tracks are something else. You play F1 and it feels like you are driving on a perfectly smooth track. You go around the Nurburgring on AC and you have to work for a decent time and learn where some bumps are to avoid (or use for better traction).Multiplayer - There are tonnes of servers up. It's easy to host a private lobby but you do need to be comfortable playing with config files as there is no GUI yet in the game.  Most tracks allow 20 cars.  Lag isn't too bad either, I regularly play against someone in New Zealand when our server is in the UK. It's not perfect, but it's raceable and far better than other games I've played online.  On the down side the options are pretty limited as MP is in the Alpha phase.What else is in the game:AI RacesTime Challenge (where you have to reach a checkpoint within a time period)HotlapDrag Race (AI only atm)Race WeekendsSpecial EventsDrifting (I've not done this as I'm turd at it)Mods - There are loads of mods out there already. Hotlap leaderboards, car skins, tyres wear/temp mods, nicer GUI's, and tracks!  Whilst they aren't as good as the offical tracks, it makes the future very bright for AC.  Like any MP game, it's better if you have a good community to race with.  I do @ www.acracers.com.Frankly, this is my favourite game period. I enjoy other genres, but this game keeps me coming back for more.			",60,3,15,4,2,1,16

  Category Score Notes   Visuals 9 One of the prettiest racing games out there, Assetto Corsa can look nearly lifelike with the right post-processing settings. At dawn or dusk, the amount of detail is nothing short of stunning and the available photo mode makes it easy to capture wallpaper-worthy screenshots. Shortcomings include a lack of weather system and the relatively bare scenery at some tracks.   Sound 7 The quality of the sound varies from car to car. Some delight your ears with crackles and pops and whines while others leave you feeling disappointed, though one has to remember not every car sounds exciting in real life. Developers have stated they are still working on improving sound assetts and the sound engine.   Physics 9 Few racing games can match Assetto Corsa when it comes to physics. Suspension, tires, track surface, and more are all accurately modeled to offer the most realistic driving experience possible, short of the real thing. Naturally, this does mean you'll want to play with a wheel to enjoy the full experience.   Force Feedback 8 Force feedback is always going to be subject to opinion as not everyone agrees on what it should be doing. Assetto Corsa's version does a good job of communicating weight transfer but can fall short when it comes to fine detail. Overall, it's easy to know what the car is doing and anyone who spends a few minutes configuring their settings should have a good time.   Cars 10 Assetto Corsa features 69 cars at the time of this review, with more being added regularly. LaFerrari with a functioning KERS system, working active aerodynamics on the Pagani Huyara, and even McLaren P1 software updates that affect rear wing behavior are just a few examples of the painstaking amount of effort Kunos Simulazioni has put into the details of every car in this game.   Tracks 9 17 tracks are currently featured in the game, all of which are recreated down to the smallest bumps, cracks, and camber changes thanks to laser-scanning technology, including the famed Nürburgring Nordschleife. The total selection is relatively low but that's the price you pay for quality - quality that makes the driving come alive when combined with the excellent physics.   Multiplayer 7 The multiplayer can suffer from trolls and bad drivers like every other simracing title that supports open races. That being said, the netcode is solid and the multiplayer experience can be excellent if you choose to join an organized league. Unless you're willing to shell out lots of money for iRacing, Assetto Corsa is almost as competitive as it gets in this category, though it's a shame the community gets fragmented with each new DLC.   AI 3 The AI in Assetto Corsa can best be described as ""serviceable."" It's there and it can drive pretty fast if you let it, but it combines a tendency to carelessly crash into the player with (oddly) over-caution. It's quite easy to block them while ahead but if you get them off the racing line, they almost always do everything in their power to return to it regardless of the consequences.   Career 3 It's difficult to enjoy the career with the AI in its current state. It can feel quite repetitive without giving you any sense of accomplishment. A handful of races are impossible to win even with world record lap times and others are quite easy to dominate despite being on the same difficulty setting. Some series also advertise ""race weekends"" without actually offering them.   Mods 9 Assetto Corsa is currently the hotbed for simracing mods. If the game doesn't already feature a car or track you want, it's probably on a website somewhere or soon will be. You can mod everything from the cars, tracks, and sounds to the menu, HUD, and career. The downside is that the developers will sometimes update the game in a way that break mods until they too are updated.   Overall 8.5 If you're looking for a hotlap simulator or a platform for league racing, then Assetto Corsa is second to none (or at least it will be when it gets a proper spectator/replay system). Casual pickup multiplayer racing is still entirely worth the money, but you'll probably want to skip the purchase if offline AI racing is the main thing you're interested in.  ",145,30,23,9,12,2,11

								This game saved me a fortune - for just £29.99, I now know I can't drive that Lotus Evora S I've always wanted. While I limit myself to a Mondeo, anyone else who wants a racing sim will be impressed with the current build state.You can also import your own tracks and cars, and tweak literally everything. It looks and drives great, but needs a Golliath of a PC to run this at the highest physics and graphics detail - as you would expect for a game built to use all that extra PC power available to it over a console.

												Kunos Simulazioni came under a lot of criticism from most sim racers for their previous title NetKar Pro, but they have learned from that experience as Assetto Corsa is an outstanding racing simulation. The early release of Assetto Corsa has satiated the long awaited sim racing community, as the beta and bi-weekly updates kept everyone satisfied. Sim racing fans will argue about who has the best tyre modelling, most accurate tracks, physics and visuals, but Assetto Corsa has managed to take all that and package it up in one great racing sim, with a top-notch physics and sublime tyre modelling, spending time with each car you will appreciate the nuances of the physics each vehicle has to offer. The visuals speak for themselves, crisp, clean and easy on the eye. The tracks are accurately modelled and replicated from laser scan data. The force feedback, even after logging on a solid amount of hours, is appreciable with subtle feeling still surprising me.On top of the regular developer created content, Assetto Corsa already has lively modding scene, making third party tracks and cars, so the future is really bright for this sim and I don't doubt most will still be playing this in years to come.With a great core, Kunos Simulazioni has proven that they have built Assetto Corsa into a successful racing simulator.

												All things come to him who waits. I have this game since it's early access version, 0.4 or so, and always liked AC's physics, because of it's balance. Anybody can drive a car, even the most powerful one, but going on the edge, barely under control, that's something few can master. This is where Assetto Corsa shines. If I had to point out one thing, why you should definitely try it - that would be the pure driving experience. Take a car of your preference, cruise it, push it, race it. You will have fun either way. Furthermore, each update and DLC proves, that Kunos Simulazioni is a very consistent group of people, who are passionate about cars and aim to make Assetto Corsa the best car game in the world. It may sound crazy, yet the sanity of the plan is of no consequence, because they really can do it.			",22,1,1,2,0,0,1

								At first glance it's just another racing sim. At the first drive I was cursing I had just done my money on another poorly built sim. I jumped on the Steam forums to voice my displeasure and discovered the ""problem"" was entirely mine. I needed to set it up properly. So I researched, dug around and found all I needed.Some tweaking and testing, fiffling and faffing..... And WOW!!! My first lap in a BMW M3 GT2 at Monza had me in awe. My second lap had me raptures. By my 3rd lap I asked for Assetto Corsa to marry me.I'm fussy. I'm picky. I hate lazy coders and slackware and this, THIS, at alpha (really??) has the potential for AAA from a small team. Plenty to do and lots of cars and tracks already. No issues, fast GFX, absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing amazing physics and awesome sound (inside cockpit GT2 - eargasms!!!!)Goes amazing with FFB on a G27 - as yet I'm voicing opinion as I am waiting for my G27 to arrive. Yep. It made me spend more money - within minutes of playing it. And there's a reason for that.It's a must if you like fast. MUST. No if's, no buts.MUST. Get it. You. Yes......			",35,16,5,7,31,1,11

How about ""THE PHYSICS ARE GREAT"" then? Forget your arcades like Gran Turismo, Forza, NFS Shifts and GTR evolutions, this is a simulation, and it's a great one at that.

												* Written a week after the 1.5 update.Assetto Corsa is, to me, the shell of a perfect racing game, and with more time and money I can see it being a truly incredible product.The physics, handling, track quality and as such, general racing immersion of AC is a level above other racing titles like Forza, Gran Turismo, or Project Cars. RFactor may offer better physics, I haven't tried it.AC may be behind some of the above on graphics and AI, and is definitely behind Forza and GT on car and track selection, and the depth of the career mode.So you have to figure out what you want in a game, due you want fidelity to real life, with accurate simulation of each car, precise aerodynamic and drivetrain calculations and laser scanned tracks, or do you want to be able to drift around corners without sacrificing lap times? Do you want a false sensation of speed, or an accurate introduction to cornering and car weight distribution? Do you want top level AI and reward intensive career progression, or are you happy endlessly lapping empty tracks, looking for slight improvements in your cornering technique.I much prefer the later, but I don't mean to disparage those who enjoy the former. I've spent my last 30hrs in game lapping one track (Zandvoort in the Netherlands), with one car (the McLaren 650S GT3) and the experience has been hugely enjoyable as I try to approach race car driver speeds (which I'm sure I'm far off, currently only the 5th fastest on RSR for that combination). The feel of laser scanned track through the force feedback is incredible, the handling dynamics superb and the complexity and precision of high-speed racing is endlessly fascinating to me.If you want to genuinely feel the sensation of racing a well modelled 458, or a McLaren P1, or a GT3 or F1 car through Spa, or the Nurnburgring, this is a near perfect way to do it (short of somehow renting one!)If you're a fan of driving, buy AC and invest in developing technique. If you're a fan of arcade style multiplayer, or the quick fun of frantic drifting buy something else.Highly recommended, from someone looking forward to the new car releases in May and June. If they can add some American and Japanese tracks, expand the list of road cars, continue to tinker with the AI, and maybe, eventually, develop a solid career mode, then this will be a perfect racing game.

												At first glance Assetto Corsa's approach to the racing genre may not appear unique or even new, but once you delve in, racing wheel in hand, it's evident that the developers have focused on translating the sense of driving to a level that may just redefine the racing genre. But will Assettos Corsa’s approach place it among the greatest racing titles ever, or will it be a forgotten name in years to come?

												I have to leave a review for this game. At first I was so frustrated about how tough it is to drive the cars so I decided to get a refund. For about a day, I did a lot of research to see if there is any other racing games out there worth considering, I ended up considering to buy Project cars or to re-buy assetto corsa. After watching a lot of reviews on YouTube comparing these two games I decided to re-buy assetto corsa, due to the positive reviews, and I absolutely don't regret that now. Yes, it takes patience and yes it requires practice but it's worth it all! After take the Pagani Zonda for a spin on the Spa, I finally understood what the experts are talking about when they speak about treating the car with tough love and drive it like you hate it, cause if you don't, the car will ""bite"" and you find yourself of the track within seconds All in all, a very great game, that's absolutely worth recommending!

												Played over 1,700 hours and still not bored.Assetto is all about the thrill of driving. The force feedback together with the sublime physics engine make driving a pleasure. Every car feels unique and has a charm and character of its own.In terms of features there are elements that other titles in the genre have that Assetto does not. What you quickly realise is that when the driving feels this good that everything else is just a bonus. ",76,5,9,7,2,0,8

Early Access Review
								Where do I start? I looked into this game after a few Google searches on what games I should play once I get hold of my Logitech G25 again and after a few YouTube videos, I decided to go ahead and buy it even though I didn't have my G25 wheel back from my buddy yet. I took a ""risk"" and ended up buying the game for its full price and played a few laps with a Xbox 360 controller. It didn't seem anything special, the tire/handling physics definitely did stand out but I didn't want to judge this game from my experience with a 360 controller so I waited.Finally I got hold of my G25 and set it all up in order to try this game, and WOW, I have tried many driving simulators on PC, PS3, Xbox360 and all with Force Feedback wheels but I have not come across a game as Realistic as Assetto Corsa. After a few practice laps, I made sure my rotation was set to 900 degrees with 100% Force Feedback strength and fully manual setup with no traction control, just 100% Stability (as I was testing the Zonda R).I still cannot get over how good it feels, everything is so realistic, the graphics are way above average when compared with other driving simulators and I'm sure it will only get better as this game is still in Early Access 0.4. I have not yet played a driving simulator that can provide me with the most ACCURATE yet CHALLENGING Force Feedback, which is very rewarding when done right. Force Feedback has never been better on a game in my opinion.From the Early Access 0.4 version, this game is definitely one of the best investments I have made in Driving Simulators. I feel like even with early access, it was worth every penny of my money (which I haven't recently felt even with other games, not just driving simulators) and it will only get better once AI is released, once Career mode is released, and once Multiplayer is released. The Assetto Corsa Development team is heading in the right direction with this game so my expectations are very high and I'm sure myself, and other consumers will not be disappointed. I'm personally most excited for Multiplayer and I can see myself spending countless hours in Drag, Drift and Track modes competing with other enthusiasts.Should you buy this game? YES! But make sure you have a good Force Feedback wheel to go with it, preferably with full pedals, a H shifter etc.Last but not least, I have also recently invested in 3D gaming, and this game was easily the best looking 3D game I have played on my 40"" Samsung (with Nvidia 3DTV Play Software), once all the depth and convergence settings were done right for each camera view, but that's pretty much something you have to do for all 3D games so I wouldn't even consider it a con.Go and buy this game!

												I´ve waited a long time with my review, because I wanted to see what kinds of addition this game gets over time. But well, here it is:Assetto Corsa is a very challenging and rewarding game. It is one of the few titles that truly deserve to be called a ""Racing Simulation"" in a genre where many games proudly boast the moniker, and then severely disappoints in that regard.Pros:- A true Racing Simulation on PC, one of the very few titles to come out in recent years- Good production value, you can really see that the devs know what they´re doing- Extremely good physics engine- Good graphics- Relatively fast AI- It´s stupidly easy to use mods- there are tons of high-quality mods of cars, tracks and UI apps readily availableCons:- 80% of the included tracks are Italian- 40% of the included cars are Lotus (seriously, there are 7 variations of the Lotus Evora and 5-6 for the Exige... Who the hell thought this was a good idea?)- Some other cars are sorely missed instead (No R34, Lancer Evo, RX-7, Challenger, Charger, C63 AMG, SLR, and no Audi´s,  Porsche´s, Toyota´s, Ford´s, e..., at all!)- AI is extremely taxing on the CPU (I have a 4 GHz AMD Octacore, and yet CPU occupancy goes above 95% when I race more than 10 cars, causing the game to stutter on my system)- AI is incapable of actually fighting for positions (they may drive quickly, but once you have caught them, you´ll easily overtake, and they will never undertake even the slightest try to get the position back)- The flag, pit stop, weather, day-night mechanics are NOT available yet. This means no chance for real competitive gameplay yet.Total: 7.5/10. Don´t get me wrong: It still is one of the best racers I have ever played! But i have to admit, I most likely only love it so much because it has no competition. There are a bunch of things that are wrong with this game, that need to be critizised.But when you´re hunting your ghost on the Nordschleife, piloting a (Mod) Mazda 787B on a cold track... you´ll forget about all of the flaws. You won´t notice any flaws, and even if you did: You wouldn´t care.In these moments, the game deserves a straight 10/10, and it will be worth the asking price all of a sudden.recommendation: Hell yes. If you are into non-arcade racing and have a capable rig - you have no excuse to not buy this.			",173,19,24,8,16,1,14

												Assetto Corsa makes Grand Turismo feel as if it is purely arcade compared to it. This game is extremely sophisticated with a myriad of optimization options, and Profesional mode in this game is how it should be played! This is the most advanced racing simulator I have ever seen and it seems as if the developers are just getting started! Anyone who is a racing sim fan will love this game but I warn those semi arcadish fans because this game is not for the weak hearted. Be prepared to spend hours upon hours attempting the races if you play it on professional mode because that is what will happen!  ",64,3,3,6,3,0,4

												So finally this game came out of early access and is finished and there can't be any excuses anymore. The game didn't changed much. Kunos simulazioni are still really bad at communicating and are very arrogant banning you if you criticize the game or ask something. I'm not talking about childish comments like ""your game sucks"".The game has a big potential. The physics are good. It has great force feedback. You feel the car, you feel almost everything through the wheel, the driving feel is really good.Developers keep adding new cars and the game gets better and better in this department, but still i want to see subaru, nissan, ford, audi, peugeut, opel and many more. It‘s a racing game so we need more cars. Of course i don‘t want fake 1000+ cars like in GT series, where you get the same 50 cars in different colors which counts as different cars. But i think ~100 different cars is a must and it's going the right way. Yes there're mods, but i want professionally created cars/tracks, not by some amateurs. There's no auto updates for the mods, so if you have like 50 of them you must update them manually every time. And some mods for this game cost money. I don't approve such behavior and will not support it.The track selection is not very good at the moment. Still there‘s no famous nurgburgring, but it is annouced as DLC. It‘s not like i‘m against DLC, but i think such track must be included in the game from the start. Especially seeing how good the game sells they should have the budget now. I think Kunos did not expect such luck. It would be cool to have some fictional tracks as well.AI. It's bad. AI is not aware of you, they just trying to drive trough you. So racing against AI is not very fun. At least they've sorted the difficulty so it's possible to beat AI now even if you make mistakes.Penalty system is absurd. It punishes you every time you go out of track, no matter if you cut the track or slide off the track. Where's the logic behind this? I'm already punished myself by going off the track and lost time and stupid system makes me go on 50kmh for 5 seconds and lose more time.There‘re challenges too, but they‘re so hard that there‘s no fun playing them, it feels more like a hard work than playing a game so all the challenges are pointless. The best times should be achievable to all players (after some practice of course), even for those which are playing with keyboard/mouse or with a controller, not only for aliens. Online leaderboards should be the place where aliens rule. Oh and forget the game if you're playing with a controller. This game must be played with wheel only. If you're looking for something similar to forza or GT, know that this game is nothing like this.Multiplayer. It's a joke. MP is boring and pointless. There's no leaderboards or player profiles, no statistics. Most of the time there're too little servers, you just can't find a game. You can join the league, but it's not fun for a casual player to compete with pros.After releasing the full game only tools for kicking people were added. Of course now every mod can ban/kick whoever he wants or dislikes without any reason.Community is one of the worst. AC fanboys are the worst, you can't say anything bad about AC or criticize it. The game is perfect for them.What year is it? Almost 2015! And there's still no night racing and no weather conditions. Even GT5 has this and it's some old game made for an old console.Graphics. The cars looks really great, but everything else is just bad. Like from 2006 but enhanced with hdr and bloom.No leaderboards. It is really fun in raceroom experience to see the times from all over the world, find your country and try to beat the time.There are few game modes. Career which consists of races and time attacks, It will take some time for you to complete it and you'll try the cars.Time attack. It's some broken game mode which makes you go slower. The slower you go in the first couple of laps the more points you get.Drift and drag racing which i'm not interested in so i can't say anything about them.Another small annoying things:When in photo mode you can't hide the racing line. Mouse pointer do not disappear while playing. Can't pause the game and check apps.Racing line is completely broken.You can have some fun in career mode and in MP with friends, but besides that i can't see how this game could be fun for a non hardcore sim fan. I'm still trying to like this game. It has some really attractive things and hope Kunos will improve the experience for non hardcore sim fans.Pros:Great physicsGood graphicsGood performanceSetup sharingCons:]Lack of tracksLack of carsNo workshop supportNo leaderboardsShallow career modeChallenges are impossible for a normal human			",700,392,38,103,109,5,116

Early Access Review
								This game has an amazing atmosphere about it to begin with. I find it hard to play it in less than 4-5 hour stints. I just can't help myself. Odds are, you're checking out this game because you like cars. LOOK NO FURTHER! With everything from the physics engine, to the graphics that look frighteningly realistic, this Racing Sim has it all. Beautiful layouts of tracks, cars, intuitive UI for modding the cars' geometry with various suspension setups; that help to not only enhance your Sim experience but to teach about the way cars work in general. I have only played for <100 hours but thats because I thought I could make Raceroom Racing Experience a little bit more like this game.ITS NOT POSSIBLE! I'VE TRIED! The attention to detail really enhances one's experience. I haven't had a single dull second in this sim. In summation, you should stop reading this and buy the game already!			",59,3,8,5,5,0,4

								Time to step it up Polyphony, this is measurably better than GT6. Better feel, better graphics, better realism, better options... the list goes on. And with a community of moders and the ability to add cars over time, I'm sure this game's garage will develop into something truly comparible. I understand this is PC vs Console but who cares. Graphics aren't as important as the feel of being connected with the car and the speed you're actually going. AC translates the feeling of speed in a way I've never felt with GT6. If you have a wheel and love racing games, get this game, period.			",96,8,5,7,6,1,11

												Assetto Corsa under $60 for everything (Not on sale)iRacing over $1000 for everything plus a monthly subscription of $7-$12....Amazing tracks (Lazer scanned)Amazing cars (Scanned and modeled)Amazing FFB (You can really push the limits of the car and yourself)Free cars and tracks now??? ok!Loads of mods avaliable created by the communityNot so good multiplayer (To have a descent online race you must join a league or use SRS)AI Were awful but have improved a bitSF-15T's ERS too basic.Not much else I can say about the negatives other than this sim really needs some kind of multiplayer scoring system with dedicated servers and races, maybe this isn't the sim for it but it certainly would flourish if it had that kind of capability. Just look at iRacing, mediocre FFB, mediocre graphics, insanely expensive and they're doing well because they are soley based on a multiplayer system.In conclusionOne of the best racing simulators out to date right now it just lacks multiplayer capabilitiesEdit: This is not a arcade or even a simcade like PCars. A wheel is a must, playing with a controller or keyboard just doesn't cut it. Please don't buy it then leave a negative review saying it was too difficult, its a sim.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: January 6, 2015
												Assetto Corsa has a lot of potential but fell short in some ways. However, at it's current stage, AC is indeed a great racing game for racing fans.First of all, the driving physics is great with excellent suspension and weight transfer physics where the cars tend to sway and bank in corners realistically like what I expected it to behave. The tire physics is also pretty decent with some good amount of simulation in it's tire model, despite it feels a bit too predictable to me. The game's drifting physics is great though as it feels fantastic to throw a car at a corner drifitng in this game. In my honest opinion, the suspension and weight transfer physics in AC blow other racing games out of the water but the tire model fell a bit short in comparison to Race Room or pCARS due to its predictability. Even though AC has one of the best driving physics among racing games on Steam, what made the game standout to me is this game also offer accessibility  to players who does not own a wheel. The game plays great on gamepad with more precise controls offered than other racing games. However, a wheel is still a must for games like AC as AC is known for its amazing force feedback that made having a wheel the optimal way to enjoy this racing game. Still, if you only have a gamepad, the game is perfectly enjoyable to play on gamepad considering the game offers a reasonable amount of assists such as stability slider(0-100%), auto gear change, ABS and traction control. More importantly, I personally find AC's driving physics to be fun to drive with good amount of depth with each car feels decently unique to drive around a track. Isnt it what racing games supposed to be? Racing games should be all about racing on different tracks while driving different cars that handles differently, instead of pointless grinding for upgrades and cars.In terms of content, AC offers a variety of licensed manufacturers from Ferrari, BMW, Mercedes Benz, KTM, Ruf, Lotus(both classic and modern), Fiat, Mclaren, Pagani and Shelby that ranges from humble Fiat 500 to Nikki Lauda's Ferrari 312. At the same time, AC also features super cars Ferrari 458, coupe such as BMW Z4, FIA GT3s like Mercedes Benz SLS GT3 or lastly, fire breathing monsters such as Pagani Zonda R or Ferrari 599XX. There is definitely something for everyone and if thats not enough for you, you could always head to sites like racedepartment.com to download additional cars made by the community where you can get Japan's only Le Mans winner, Mazda 787B, single cup racing cars such as Ginetta G50 GT4 or even the pretigious German DTM cars. The car list can be a bit too Euro centric to some people but the developers had also announced more manufacturers are coming to AC in the future, for example, Audi, Lamborghini, Toyota, Nissan and Corvette. On the other hand, AC's track list is pretty lean to some as they only feature 10 locations that are all based in Europe at the moment that includes Imola, Monza, Silverstone and Spa as examples. AC's tracks are all laser scanned where you can feel every bump and crest when you drive on it's official tracks which does add a lot to the authenticity of the game. In my opinion, AC is still lack of popular tracks such as Brands Hatch, Laguna Seca, Le Mans Circuit and so on. Still, you could always find community made tracks to further enhance the game's track list. Do note that AC's mod community quality varies wildly so you will definitely need time filter through mods to find gems in the modding community. At the same time, Kunos has intentions to support the game for the next 5 years so do expect the game to have quite a few DLCs. So far, the first official post release content pack seemed to be a decent expansion pack where it comes with the 20km long laser scanned track, often nicknamed as Green Hell with 10 additional brand new cars introduced into the game. At the same time, the developers will also patch in free cars and tracks from time to time such as the recently patched in Ruf CTR2.My main criticism with the game so far is, AC is lacking in terms of features if one compared it to some of it's competitors, rFactor and Project CARS. At the time of writing, there are many features that are common in real life racing series such as night driving, rain weather that will affect your car's grip, AI pitstops and flags penalty. The developer had confirmed that Flags and AI pitstops will be added into the game eventually but rain and night driving will probably not included in the game until it's sequel. Another criticism of mine would be, AC's AI is fairly rudimentary as they are completely unaware of player's presence in the field where they might crash into your back occasionally while they have some tendency to over brake at some parts of a track that made them easy to overtake. Since Early Access, the developers had been patching the AI to perform better but it is still a far cry from what rFactor, Raceroom, Grid Autosports or Project CARS can offer. The multiplayer servers are also barebones with confusing UI and lacking of the robust multiplayer feature that iRacing has. However, the worst part of AC would be it's optimisation where the "">95% CPU Occupancy"" issue that will cause stuttering and poor AI performance still persist till now if you race with more than 20 AI cars. This issue is particularly severe if one plays on community made tracks with less optimisation but one could always opt for less cars on grid to eliminate the issue. There are optimisation being fixed with patches but I sincerely hope this issue will be fixed in the future. Still, optimisation issues are expected in racing games such as AC due to it's more computational intensive simulation in comparison to Grid or NFS while some racing simulators in the market, such as rFactor 2 are said to have CTD issues in some cases.  If you just want a great racing game to race with 15 AI or hotlap solo around a track, these optimisation issues are unlikely to occur. Lastly, the career mode in AC is completely forgettable as it is just a few preset championship events that offers barely anything new from what you can do in the race menu. The career mode also does not offer any progression system that is found in Forza or GT6 where you had to buy and upgrade cars. In conclusion, Assetto Corsa is a decent racing game at its current stage with reasonable amount of content. Just like French cheese that tastes better as time goes by, I have no doubt that AC will improve over time with official DLCs, new features and also mod content from it's healthy mod scene being added into the game. At its current stage I do recommend this game if you are a racing fan looking for a more simulation heavy racing game and do not mind some of its flaws as AC is still a competent racing game at its current stage.I had played more than 70 hours so far and I could see that AC will be on my HDD for some time in the future. It is definitely a great time to be a PC gamer as more and more racing games such as Assetto Corsa, Game Stock Car and Project CARS are developed independently for PC.			",225,47,45,30,30,1,80

 It's really sad to see people simply giving negative review for seeing Stefano's (dev) reaction on forum. The incident has passed on, the professional driver Fredrik Sørlie and Stefano has peacefully ended their conversation on Reddit. They aren't fighting anymore. Also, the game is purchased by a different company now. Things will be different. For now, I will leave this comment just so that people will stop getting the wrong idea. I will revisit and rewrite this review once things have settled, but the current situation with this review section is just outrageous.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								If i'm honest I started to get a little worried that this game would fall into the DayZ trap and be in development forever,with games like Project cars on the way I was starting to lose all interest in Assetto Corsa......until the 1.0 update.The game now looks absolutly STUNNING,yes we need more cars and tracks but the game itself satisfies my racing urges and plays fantastic with the Xbox One controller (which i will be upgrading to a new wheel as soon as possible).The cars handle and move much better than any driving sim i have played in the past and I am a huge Forza and Grand Tourismo fan,and this was keeping me on consoles,the fact PC had no good racing sims,now I can say PC has everything I want in a gaming platform.Sorry Forza and GT........Assetto Corsa has risen the bar for a quality racing sim.

												I've had this game for over a year now and I can say it's by far the most fun and realistic simulator I've ever played. The modding community makes great mods if you get bored of the tracks and cars that the game comes with. My only complaint would be that the speed looks nothing like what you're actually going and that the motion blur just looks like you're losing frames, but other than that, there's no other problems.

												Best racing simulator ever. There are few games that genuinely put a smile on your face, but Assetto Corsa is definitely one of them. Pulling out a huge successful slide or racing with sweaty palms for victory, this game delivers that all with tremendous success.The driving physics are as real as they can be, and that for me is top priority in a racing sim. Pulling slides in a 458 makes you feel the same kind of excitement that I would presume Chris Harris feels when he reviews cars (even though he is from another planet when it comes to driving). After over a year of playing it's just getting better and better with more content to come. Awesome mod community with a lot of potential to add even more content makes this a must have racing sim. If you like cars and driving, you'll love Assetto Corsa. Benchmark for all racing games, for years to come. And referring to Mr. Chris Harris: ""This is MEGA!""			",34,3,5,4,4,0,3

												This game is addictingly accurate. Even playing with a controller rather than a wheel you get so much feedback that driving the cars feels to natural. That's not to say easy -- some of these cars and the challenges the game gives you to complete with them will kick your♥♥♥♥♥ But the physics make sense. You can improve your setup and driving because you'll know exactly what you did wrong and you'll feel how the setup changes impact your lap.+Great tracks and cars already with more coming and a great modding community.Never been into racing sims, but I can't stop playing this.

								Wow... I have been looking for a game like this for a while. You can play the game two ways: 1. You play it like a simulator sweating your♥♥♥♥♥off. Loads of fun.2. You just kinda chill out and go out for a nice sunday drive, maybe even drift a little. Loads of fun.Any way you like it, you're gonna enjoy it. The game is really well optimized, and it seems to work with nearly any racing wheel. I used a 9-year-old racing wheel, and it worked like a charm! The fact that the game has modding abilities, makes me fall in love with it even more. Wether you want to drift around on Rainbow Road with you BMW M3 or cruise around Paris with your Fiat 500, the mods have got you covered. The realism that Kunos have put into the game, is outstanding. The car sounds, the handling and the looks! The game looks and sounds epic overall. It's astonishing that the game is only in early access, since it sure feels like a complete game. I cannot wait to see how the game turns out on release! Kudos Kunos. Kudos...9.5/10			",19,0,3,1,5,0,0

												This game is just amazing. The moment you get on the wheel you know everything feels right. I was impressed by Project Cars, had to buy a steering wheel to play it though, unplayable with gamepad. But Assetto Corsa is ages ahead of any street racing game. The tracks really do feel right, they are laser scanned, the cars feel right, the street feels right and it's totally playable with a gamepad too. The game engine graphics is amazing, you can play with really high grapchics and have a constant of 60 FPS. Congratulations to the dev team of Kunos Simulazioni. 10/10.			",254,39,10,21,17,0,37

												What the team @Kunos have done with this is nothing but incredible.I had the chance to follow the development since it's very early stages and seeing this sim grow and evolve into what it has become to date, has been an amazing ride on its own.Let's get a few things straight, right of the bat: Asseto Corsa is NOT a game. This is a HARDCORE DRIVING SIM at its finest. The sooner you understand this, the better. Assetto Corsa is unforgiving, it is frustrating, it is relentless. It will beat you down and eat you every time you make a mistake without mercy. You want to know why? Because that is exactly what happens when you drive a racing car at its limits. You will need to study it, you will need to learn from it. It is a beast that needs to be tamed before you can even dare 'playing' with it. And even then, it will NEVER be your pet. It will always remain as a wild animal, and as such it demands your respect. A fairly decent WHEEL & setup is very much needed, if you wish to enjoy Assetto Corsa the way it was intended to. (You 'can' use your keyboard / joystick to drive but I would consider it blasphemy. Not to mention that you'll never know what you are missing) Setting up your wheel might be confusing and even troubling at first. But the process you need to go through now to get that done is quite simple and easy. You'll just need to read a little. Long story short it basically goes like this: Config wheel drivers. Using the 'LUTgenerator' with the proper .csv file generated by the 'WheelCheck' app is absolutely a MUST. (Google is your friend) Config in-game wheel settings. The most important thing here is getting rid of all the so called 'artificial effects'. Meaning that, ideally,  the only slider you need to leave at 100% is the MAIN FFB. (basically you want the FFB signals to come as RAW as possible from your wheel with nothing extra added, even your 'minimum force' should be at 0, because the LUT takes care of that automatically.) Once everything is setup, you will need the 'FFBClip' app when you hit the road with your favorite car & track. This will help you very easily adjust the FFB on-the-fly for each car & track combo, so your wheel does not clip. (It is important that your wheel does not clip AS LONG AS YOU STAY ON THE ROAD, otherwise it doesn't matter, i.e: when you go through sand/grass terrain in a track it's fine for the wheel to clip, as that is obviously not where you're supposed to go nor staying for too long)That's it. You are now officially free to go to any track with any car and enjoy the ride. (You are welcome.)Now I'll point a few of it's best / worst / missing features:BEST:Laser scanned tracks. As precise as they can get.Real cars with every detail taken into consideration. Coded with real engineering information, data taken directly from each and every manufacturer.Unparalleled level of immersion and realism once setup is rightfully completed.Infinite amount of MODS and love from the community. Cars, tracks, telemetry, liveries, and even complete seasons available for download, you name it, search it, and most likely you will find it.Online works great. The net-code is well optimized and you can play without any issues even with higher pings. (People complaining about the online have absolutely no idea where to get into and find decent people to drive with. They are just entering public servers full of kids crashing each other with keyboards, nonsense. AVOID THAT. YOU NEED TO FIND A LEAGUE, WITH PRIVATE SERVERS and join their community, THERE IS WHERE YOU'LL FIND ALL THE PROs and all the good that racing seriously can be)VR GLORY OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED.Great variety of graphical settings, you can easily play this without any problems with a lower end machine if you set everything to minimum.Performance is GREAT at the higher settings, if you have the right hardware.Last but not least, devs are absolutely great. They have added and fixed almost everything the community asked for. Community feedback played a huge roll in this evolving sim. Not to mention that, their base of operation is actually within one the laser scanned tracks (Vallelunga). So this people are for real, they have direct access to everything, official engineering information, pro drivers opinions... The whole package, literally. Kunos Simulazioni is the real deal.WORST:OVERWHELMING AND UNFRIENDLY FOR NEWCOMERS.The sound engine could be better, although it gets the job done, there is room for improvement, especially with some of the lesser cars. (A good pair of headphones makes this less noticeable)Limited damage models. Damage does occur and cars can be beaten down to the stationary point. It is just that I find it not accurate and have seen far better damage models, even in arcade racing games, sadly.VR SUPPORT for VIVE users arrived late, very late, and you still have to navigate the menus without your headset on. Because menus are not implemented in VR yet. Once on the track though it works wonderfully. FIRST SETUP CAN BE A PAIN IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING, even worse, you might even give up this precious gem because of this. I think this could be vastly improved as well.AI is fairly stupid and slow when attacking corners.MISSING: Night time (although there are mods for this)Rain (I love driving in the rain, I think it is the true equalizer in racing. It is what separates good drivers from legends. I would love to see this officially implemented in Assetto Corsa.)VR menus.Overall, I absolutely recommend this amazing SIM to people who love racing and are seriously interested about it. I'm far from a professional driver, but I can hold my own in a real track. Not to brag or anything like that, but I went to driving school when I was just a little kid, and had the chance during my youth to actually drive and train with real racing cars (from karts all the way up to TC2000 here in Argentina, nothing too fancy), so I consider my self experienced enough. Assetto Corsa is second to none, trust me. And I played them all, extensively. (iRacing, rFactor 1, rFactor 2, RBR, Automobilista, you name it...) Even with all its quirks, and everything you have to put in to fully enjoy it... (Mainly hardware money and the time invested setting everything up perfectly). This is for people who do actually understand the physics involved in a true racing scenario and are not afraid to step into the journey of its steep learning curve.The rest of you, wanting a more casual experience, buy Project Cars on PC or go buy Gran Turismo with your PS4. These are far more enjoyable games with a controller/joystick.This ended up being a longer than expected review, but I felt the need to give my honest unbiased opinion after seeing so many ignorant negative reviews recently. I hope this review help you guys in making a more informed decision before buying Assetto Corsa.Cheers from Argentina.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I have been sim racing for about 6 months now and have tried many sims including iRacing, rFactor and Game Stock Car, as well as many simcade titles as well. I can say without a doubt that Assetto Corsa feels like the best. That's not to say the others are without merit, they have their own strengths and weaknesses. But when it comes to communicating the way the car feels to you through a force feedback wheel, AC is second to none. You can truly feel when your car is riding on the edge of available grip and the car will react accordingly to the inputs you give it. The physics and FFB are something that need to be felt to be believed.The AI needs some work but can be passable, however I feel that online leagues where this game will shine for those looking for strong, clean, competitibe racing. Public lobbies can be ok, however you may find griefers driving the wrong way and trying to wreck others. Ask around forums or check steam groups if you are looking for clean racers.I hesitate to speak too much on controllers as I use a wheel and pedals, but I will say with many aids turned on it's not impossible to keep yourself on track. It may be a fine way to learn the tracks while waiting to purcahse a wheel.I have no doubt Kunos will continue to supply top-notch free and paid content in the coming years which will be finely supplimented by content created by modders. AC will definitely be a hub for great racing from many different fandoms in the motorsports world. I highly recomend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game runs really now on the Vive, courtesy of the latest patch. I have a 1080, so I switched off post processing, ramped up the AA, the detail settings and the super sampling, and it runs very smoothly. The cockpit scale is perhaps a little off, but the overall experience is excellent. Thanks heaps to the Dev's for supporting Open VR and not just hoping Vive owners would rely on reVive.

								This is my first review I felt I needed to make on such a great sim. Started playing Assetto Corsa when it was first put on steam. I could not have picked a better simulator. I've played a LOT of racing simulators/games, but this one sticks out the most. With the modding community releasing new cars and tracks every other day. The original cars and tracks in the game are top notch! The handling is awesome. The graphics are beautiful. Overall the atmosphere is pretty sweet. I'm glad 1.0 is here it was definitely worth the wait, and I can't wait for future content I will be supporting the developers for such a great simulator!The only con's is: # 1 The AI they are really buggy, But it does not matter because in a simulator you race against real people for the full effect and it does not bother me one bit!#2 To get the full experience you will need a racing wheel, I have tried it with a controller and it was just a mess, than again it is a Simulator.

								Assetto Corsa is by far one of the most enjoyable racing (simulations) out there. There is already a huge mod community developing content. This game gets the basics dead on: menus, load times, UI, hardware optimization, open platform, etc. It also gets the complex stuff right as well: Game physics, graphics, sound, etc. Physics are the real standout. If you have a racing wheel, you are in for a special experience. Is it perfect? No. Sounds could be better. Graphcis are not going to blow you away. And some nice features like day night cycles and weather are not planned. (keep in mind this is a small team building this game)If you want a fun racing sim with a great mod community that does everything well, then AC is your best bet.			",21,4,10,4,7,0,1

I was gonna give a positive review, especially for the effort bringing stunning porsches line-up here. But i have acknowledged by stefano's behaviour towards fredrik sorlie.. i decided to give this title a negative review. Because it is a massive insult and unforgiving bigotic behaviour.

												Assetto Corsa.... One hell of a Racing game! And A Superb Sim! 95/100!Assetto Corsa, A racing game for true enthusiasts and Mild drivers alike. Lets start off with the physics..You have several types of Car game physics ""Arcade/Sim and Simcade"" assetto falls in the category of Sim. It may not have Clutch bite like Rfactor, Or the intense Simulation feel iRacing does, But you get a very close feel of both without costing you a fortune or looking dated. With most sim racers, They either have bad UI, Dated graphics, unsupported games and Awkward to set up Servers..but with AC. None of that, and all the great driving physics you can want! Pros:-It has mods and full mod support.-Still getting updates (Not too old of a game)-Graphics are Nice (Maybe not as visually stunning as PCARS but it has a lot of nice details, And unless you are worried about background details such as trees and houses. it's okay) Some ingame screenshots can look real if done correctly.-Wide Variation of cars (American/Japanese/European) -A Career mode (Some might not be bothered by this, others like a goal in their racing game, always a plus)-Easy to setup and use Server base( Could be better but it isn't hard, especially for a Sim based game) -Wheel support- Multimonitor support-In game apps that allow lots of live data to be shown (tyre temps, fuel, g force, FOV adjuster)-Lazer Scanned tracks The game as a whole is really fun, With both wheel and gamepad, I wouldn't recommend to any keyboard warriors however. The game isn't too demanding but modern ish tech is needed for a decent framerate.(obvs)Now on to the cons:-No clutch bite ( when bringing up the clutch in 1st it should crawl slowly like a real car, however it doesn't do that)-No day/night cycle (no night time)-No Rain The game is superb, if you are after a Good racing game (sim based) Then this is a nice medium, That won't cost you a fortune, has plenty of cars and tracks (lots of mods too, easy to install) And a friendly-ish Comumnity , AC is a good buy! Plenty of drifting,touge,Hillclimb,GT3,BTCC and more! AC>PCARSTl;DR I great Racer for Avid or new sim Racing fans looking for a modern nice looking Racing game. Works nicely on Gamepads and wheels, Needs day/nigh and rain modes. 95/100.I Recommend Assetto Corsa and give it a 95/100. Happy Racing! ",349,84,33,37,57,2,44

												It's a great way to get a realistic drive experience, you just need a combination of a good FFB Wheel and good settings (matter of taste). The Tracks are laser scanned and there are a lot of available cars (dlc + mods). In my Opinion:Pro:+drive experience +laser scanned tracks+car and track mods+many updates+car sounds+many dlc's~graphics (you can use mods)con:-menu (looks boring to me)I never had an issue till now, so i can't say how the support is.

												This game is my first proper racing simulator, my only previous track racer was shift 2 unleashed,and lets be honest,it wasnt that realistic. I consider myself a somewhat casual gamer, especially when it comes to racing games, burnout paradaise, the crew, and iven GTA , i feel at home when playing those.And yet i felt tempted to buy Assetto Corsa, due to the cars like Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche,all in the same game, and my favorite, Mclaren. But mainly because its a simulation, despite the fact im using a controller, and despite i never driven a car in my life, i still wanted to get that actual feel of the car, the thrill, how it moves, how it behaves.I took Mclaren P1 to Brands Hatch, and decided to use 3rd person camera, to hear how the car sounds, and my god it sounds good.From the Top Gear series and some YouTube videos memory, i coud tell it sounds like the real deal.I can feel every bump, apex, and paved over parts of the track, when i lost it, i coud get it back, when i drove off the track, going too quickly into the corner, or going too wide, i coud tell it wasnt due to the game, but me. When i did several laps at Brands Hatch, i was geting faster, taking the corners better, started using the DRS because i ddint iven knew you can use it in the game, and having a blast driving around, and i was doing all that, in 3rd person camera, just to hear the engine of the Mclaren, its amazing, and also the tracks are laser scanned.The game can look beautiful, well from looking at the screenshoots, i have an AMD FX-6350, 8GB of ram and GTX 750 1GB OC,the non TI version, and i can run the game at smooth 60 fps and 1080p, without looking like it came from early 2000s.I did not have enough experience with the AI, as i did only 2 races 2 laps each, with a single opponent, and i used lowest AI difficulty setting 80%.I coud stay in first place, throughout the whole race, the opponent iven overtook me once. The AI was 2 seconds behind when i finnished.When it comes to car selection itself, its very good, its quality over quantity, i dont know how many cars are there exacly, especially with the dlc, i got all Dream packs, japanse pack, trpl3 pack, and Porsche pack 1. But there seem to be plenty enough, there is something here for everyone, from open wheel, to retro rides, coupes, everyday cars, supercars, and GT.You can read on all the cars, about their specs and history, you can also view them in showroom, opening doors, looking inside etc. You can change the colour of the cars, but not sure about the vinyls yet.When it comes to settings, on track and in options, theres plenty, all kinds of  HUD telemetries, and you can iven move them around and set them to your liking, you can set your fov, your siting position in the car, and i belive iven traction control and other '' controls'' on the fly aswell, you can ofcource setup the car itself in the pits. There are penalites and all that jazz, you can turn that off, among other things, in the options menu. There are plenty of assissts in the game to help, and iven presets, from gamer, to proffesional. The controller support in the racing itself is really good, plenty of options to set, but strangely, it doesnt work in the menus, you need to use the mouse.In other options, you can change volume of tire screeching, engine, tarmac, etc. You can also set the virtual wheel rotation as in the ammount of movement the guy behind the wheel in game have to do, and plenty of graphical options aswell, the game is rather well optimized.When it comes to content, there is career mode, practice mode, hot laps, drift, drag, quick race, championship, and challenges, You can iven create your own Championship aswell, and there are options in eariler modes, from time of day, allthough there is no night, or rain in the game....yet, temperature , the surface of the track, the ammount of oppnents,22 is max i belive, laps, and other things.Despite im a complete nub and a somewhat casual player, and this being my first proper racing sim, im having a blast, plenty of cars, somewhat good tracks, tho there coud be more, and im sure there will be in the future, as they are laser scanned, plenty of modes, rather scrub friendly, and well optimized.If you have been wondering to pick this up as your first sim racer, but worried if its ''too hardcore'' or too difficult, dont worry, if i can win with a controller in 3rd person camera against an opponent, anyone can.And most importnantly, the game is being improved all the time aswell.

								This is it, Assetto Corsa is simply put the best racing sim I've ever played. Right out of the box it has the best, most naturally feeling and pleasing physics out there. Do you want to drive slowly? For the first time ever, you can. Do you want to drive over the limit? That works too.It's also the first sim to officially support drifting without adding weird, mode specific physics, and the fact that I had to watch several real life instructional videos to get the hang of it speaks volumes of how good this is.The most important thing though, it just feels good. The force feedback on this thing is simply way ahead of the competition, cars feel real, you can feel every bump and elevation change on the road, you can feel weight shifting (not only lateral but also longitudinal forces too, somehow), it's just bananas.Let's also add the fact that it looks gorgeous and has fantastic performance, plus official mod support (not yet imlemented, but there's plenty of awesome mods already in the works), and great developer support and you got yourself a great sim that's bound to last.The fact alone that I've played this for over 15 hours already and it doesnt even have AI or multiplayer support yet (it's an early access after all) speaks for itself.It's good, if you got a wheel, then get this thing, it's kickass.

												I bought this for two reasons:    1) Project Cars is running like a dog on my AMD 290x graphics card    2) It was 50% off on steam and had good reviewsI am just getting in SimRacing and have bought quite a few pieces of software to go along with my shiny new G27 Wheel. iRacing, DiRT RALLY, Stock Car Extreme, Project Cars, WRC4 to name a few, Assetto Corsa is the best of the bunch, by a considerable margin.The graphics are not the very best, nor the sound and I have seen better presentation, but this is about simulation - not gloss. AC is more natural to me than any other sim I have played. The grip, the traction, the weight transfer - the complete package is just amazing. After playing this for a little while, nothing else feels quite right!There are some mighty contenders - iRacing, Stock Car Extreme and DiRT rally being very high quality Sims - but they all pale in comparison to the mighty Assetto Corsa. Graphics: 8/10    Would have been a 9 if it wasn't for Pcars!Sound: 7/10    Varies quite a bit between different vehicles - some are amazing, others averagePresentation: 8/10    OK menu system and Configuration options - could be a little betterContent: 10/10    Comes with a decent amount of tracks, cars and game modes    LOADS OF FREE QUALITY MODS!!! Tracks, cars - you name it    Paid DLC too...Feel: 10/10    This is where AC shines, it feels amazing - nothing and I mean NOTHING can touch itGrin Factor: 10/10    Absolute Quality - no other racing game comes close to making me smile like this ;)Overall 9/10   Forget the rest, this really is the best!

												This game is best enjoyed if you like to hotlap alone or to play in private servers. The AI is bad (at this moment), the official content is a bit poor (there will be DLCs), career mode is simple (premade themed individual races, no story, no unlocks, no car improvements), and playing online against random people in open servers sucks bad (trolls everywhere, you know), but if you enjoy the pleasure of driving in a very realistic way, even alone, this is one of the best car simulators of the last years. The mod support makes the game even better with tons of community content, as cars, tracks or in-game apps.Steering Wheel very recommended.			",274,44,26,25,22,5,52

												Fantastic Racing Simulator, with a very active modding community and some very good external apps - RSR Live Timing for example is a must.Game can still be quite temperamental with unexplained fatal crashing  and the online multi-player is still missing many elements, such as unsatisfying results screen.However the positives far outweigh the negatives and this is a must buy for any race fan and a game I expect to still be enjoying far beyond the 1000 hour mark.Edit:As a little addition - I think it is only fair to say that the game has become considerably more stable and much less likely to crash out in recent updates.Much effort has also been made in streamlining the online multiplayer experience, which ran like a bit of a dog in the earlier releases, but which now holds a good average and perfectly adequate frame rate with 20+ online players participating.

												Reasons to buy this game:+ The physics engine is very realistic+ All tracks are laser-scanned so even the smallest details get put in the game+ Cars sound exactly like in real life (I'm a track marshal at Zandvoort so trust me on that)+ Multiplayer on dedicated servers with 25 players.+ Works fantastic with a 360 controller without having to fiddle with settings, i am able to accurately steer and keep up with wheel users.+ The game supports quality mods, many of which are readily available across the web+ Kunos adds regular new content in the game a few times a year, mostly for free.+ Despite being a sim the game is not hard to get into, all assists can be modified.Reasons not to buy the game:- You only play racing games where you do 200km/h drifts and you don't like sims- Career is a bit meh- You believe that braking before corners is for sissies			",71,38,10,3,3,2,2

												HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!!!!This is the best physics engine in any racing game hands down. Might not be the absolute best for just racing or serious trackwork for dedicated sim raccers (although it it still amazing for racing), assetto corsa comes into its own for drifitng and being able to hold a slide just if you want to learn how to control a car on the edge of its grip. Assetto corsa is the only game I've ever played where the handeling model will let you dance on the edge of a cars grip with full confidence that it wont bite back. Everything s controlable and smooth and if you stick with this game for even a little while you will learn so much as a driver. The modding support community is also a massive bonus for heaps of extra free conent but the DLC the Kunos provides is amaing as well, they're one of the best devs ive ever  come accross theyre really close to the community and support the game with regularuodates and DLC. In my opinion, dont even wait for a sale, just buy this thing its worth every penny if you like cars and youll never regret it!			",13,1,7,0,4,0,0

								it is very good game, very well playable even on gamepad. Even though the best experience is on wheel. Still missing quite a few features, but hopefully these will be added later on. 2 biggest  pluses for me are officially licensed Ferrari content and official modding capability - which takes this game onto another level			",51,5,36,10,20,0,8

												Im a pretty keen sim racer, I have a dedicated setup on an obutto with Thrustmaster T500rs, modded pedals, H shifter, sim vibe, triples and recently a Rift CV1. I have been league racing for a few years in games like rfactor2, Assetto Corsa and iRacing.Assetto Corsa is a fun game and if i could make the choice again i would still buy it. But for me it had become somewhat of a hot lap simulator to do a few laps in every now and then. Its a pretty game, it works well with simvibe but the multiplayer matching was crap and the single player events were a bit rubbish as well.  In Comparison:* Assetto wins the gfx competition hands down (until you consider the rift implementation).* The rift implementation in iRacing is much better due to what i believe is the pixel density improving the horrid jaggies. RF2 will never support the rift so although i have loved it dearly its now dead to me. * The mulitplayer implementation of iRacing cant be beaten, its head and shoulders above any other racing game and this is where replayability is born* Physics can be a bit subjective without actually being on the Dev staff of each company but i feel that iRacing and RFactor2 have the slight upper hand. The fact that real GT3 racers use their real life car setups in iRacing says a lot about just how realistic it is.* League racing iRacing and RFactor2 are better by far, in many respects Assetto feels incomplete in comparison* Content.. I dont care for road cars, I like to race in race cars so a lot of whats in Assetto has low appeal for me* Straight up single player fun.. DiRT Rally is the winner of this category for meSummary:If Assetto had a strong multiplayer system including ranking that was even half as good as iRacing and a better menu system + rift implementation it would probably be my goto sim racing game. But as it stands its near the bottom of the pile, one rung up from RF2 but only since RF2 is rift-less			",31,1,3,0,6,1,9

Early Access Review
								Assetto Corsa. I wasn't one of those guys who hyped it before I played it. Hell I was absolutely skeptical when one of my better friends went absolutely nuts about it on Facebook based on Kunos' reputation alone.Unlike him, i've actually got the PC hardware to actually play the game. When I first loaded the game I was incredibly underwhelmed. Bearing in mind I just spend 33 bucks on an impulse buy, and that I play on a 360 gamepad due to the logistical nightmare of setting up my wheel, I was rather underwhelmed. The framerate was choppy, aliasing was absolutely everywhere, the textures didn't look nice at all, but the worst was that it felt a bit arcady. Cars felt like they were far too reactive and the BMW M3 GT2 felt like it had too much grip.Well, one visit to RaceDepartment.com forums fixed absolutely EVERYTHING wrong with my initial set up. You do have to fiddle around with the Nvidia control panel (if you're team green) and the in game set up to get the best visual quality, but one of the biggest oddities in the game is the way Kunos handles assists and tyre compounds. Its not something that is intuitive, and i had to put some research in to actually understand the UI. I eventually found out that i was running on the SuperSoft compound, which to my knowledge isn't actually used in GT racing.Once I flicked it down to the harder compounds, absolutely everything fit into place. The car felt absolutely divine, playing on a controller was not a problem at all. Never going to be as good as a wheel but those without that option need not worry. One thing this game has changed the way I play race sims is the racing line. In Gran Turismo, Forza Motorsports, F1 2012/13, anything that actually offers a racing line really, I've taken that option. Assetto Corsa has weaned my off that reliance, at least in the game, and has given me the confidence to give it a go in others as well. Playing this game with only the rev counter and gear indicator on the bottom right is truely an experience unlike any other. I booted up the game as of writing, intending to see how the M3 GT2 goes on the harder tyre (I tried out the Zonda R earlier today, it was brilliant). I recorded 10 minutes of it and spent the remaining hour just lapping and learning the track and car.Assetto Corsa is truely astonishing. I had not heard of Kunos' reputation before hand with netKar-Pro, I knew absolutely NOTHING about the title before I plonked down 33 bucks on the recommendation of a friend. I am now absolutely in love with this sim and can't WAIT to see whats Kunos has in store for the future.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I WOULD recommend this game if it hadn't come to light that the lead developer has no clue of how to take criticism on the forums and would rather have a mental breakdown in response to it than calmly look into or at least acknowledge the person's inquiry. Yeah, nice job working PR. How dare someone that has loads of experience in driving cars for multiple manufacturers tell you to try something with your tire model and see how it works? Keep surrounding yourself with yes men until your active players fall to two-digit figures. If I worked on cars that were featured in this, I would be horrified by what you're doing. Either get a grip or find another job. At least see a therapist.Here's an article talking about all of this:https://pretendracecars.net/2017/01/10/another-year-another-stefano-meltdown/As for the game itself, it is pretty good. Just use your own judgement on whether or not it's worth giving money to a company headed by an easily displeased manchild.			",97,8,15,8,11,2,3

								I own almost every driving/ racing title ever made for the PC other than the monthly premium titles with a micro-transaction existence. I am writing this review and the title is still in development and is in Alpha/Beta stage.  The reason that I do not care about if it Alpha or Beta is because it is excellent at whatever stage it is currently.  This title has it all, it allows MODS, it allows private servers, custom skins... the works! The physics model is excellent and the sounds are absolutely spot on. Camera views and the ability to record and save your replays so you can analyze any section of the track at any point in the race is incredible. Sure there are lots of other racing games out there, but you will be hard pressed to find better than Assetto Corsa.I love this title and give it 5 out of 5 Stars. - Hajimoto Approved! ;^) ",430,56,40,38,43,2,44

												A great driving simultator.I don't do multiplayer but I can say that the single player ""Career Mode"" isn't terribly exciting to me. And random races are kinda frustrating--the AI and the fine-grained, non-adaptive difficulty settings don't make for great racing. You choose 85-100%—which personally I don't find works terribly well since one setting doesn't seem to be perfect for all cars/tracks for me. I'll set it to 88% and blow by everyone in the first lap then do another race at the same setting and never see anything but the AI's taillights. I've had more exciting races from Gran Turismo and that series isn't exactly known for the quality of its AI.But when it comes to having a good physics simulation with ample support for mods, that's where Assetto Corsa shines.And Porsche! Did I mention AC has access to Porsche? (Kunos is the first developer to have access to Porsche since EA got the license in the late '90s.) That alone was enough to sway me toward AC over its competitors. If you're a Porschephile like me, the three Porsche Pack DLCs are definitely worth picking up.If you enjoy hotlapping a good driving simulator, Assetto Corsa is a great game. If you want something that skews toward more ""exciting"" racing against AI competitors or if you want the prettiest racing game on the market, there are probably better choices out there.

I mean 2014 , I looked into AC and I'm thinking I will be dropping off the Codies Bandwagon..I'm only going to purchase 2014 if I get good reviews from ppl I know and trust.AC is not perfect by any means , but the best parts of AC and the Best parts of 2013 chopped up and put in a blender could yield some amazing results.id its one thing I really am super happy with about AC its the force feedback its 2nd to none .Anyway to all the people I've took  the♥♥♥♥♥♥of , who played AC ..

												This was my first attempt at early access.  I needed a racing game like Forza and GT, not grid 2.  Asseto Corsa has mostly delivered on that. Migrating to racing sims has been tough.  Cars are harder to drive, and there aren't many options for customizing anything other than the setup. Considering that real driving involves that, not upgrading everything whenever you feel slow, I can deal without the modability.  Being early access, there isn't much to do.  There are a few challenges and enough to keep you racing for quite a few hours, but I can't wait until the carer gets implemented.  The physics, the sense of speed, the sound, and the graphics are all top notch. While there is still some optimizing to be done, this game runs beautifully and racing with AI or alone is bliss.  Multiplayer has yet to be implemented.  Another thing I really like is the ability to mod the game and add apps.  Open mod support is huge for games in general, but a racing sim will see some really cool stuff, we already have!  The apps are for the UI and there is source code to encourage the community to develop apps.  Apps are generally used for displaying some data, but its nice being able to customize my UI, and place everything, from lap times, to the odometer in a specifc place, out of my way.  I have logged over one hundred hours in this beta, and I've been smiling the whole time (except when AI bumps you off the track, bt they are getting better with each update, drive cautiously)UPDATE(3/16/15):  The Nord has been unleashed and its epic.  The car pack equally insane.  AI has been greatly improved, although most would argue they arent all that fast or competative.  There are flags now and some other minor tweaks to gameplay features including tire blankets, fog, factory settings, etc, etc.  The only complaint I have for the game is the career.   Everything is unlocked from the start tho, so get out there and get driving.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game was a suprisingly fun experience. As an avid Forza fan for years I have always wanted something I could play on PC. Now, don't let me lead you on this is NOT Forza. It is a very different type of sim-racer ( for those looking for a direct replacement ). It is much less forgiving, but focuses more on the accurate reproduction of racing. It is a gorgeous game, far prettier. The handling is a lot more on the realism side; and as such are pretty difficult to get used to.. but with the right setup even an Xbox 360 controller will be tolerable. The track selection has improved a lot since very old updates of the alpha I had played, and the game has gotten a much larger selection on cars. Even 2ish days experience on the game, I am thoroughly enjoying it. Highly recommend.			",164,24,7,15,11,2,15

												Alright guys,after almost 20 hours spent on this game i decided to make a review.This game impressed me pretty much.Game looks stunning and it's moddable.It has huge amount of mods that acctually look pretty good.I know Kunos is small company but they didn't made enough cars.Yes there is DLC but without it game looks poor,thanks God there are modders.And now the biggest issues i heard in reviews about this game:AI!Yes,AI could have more aggressive aproach and similar,but it isn't that bad.When i read reviews i expected game to be like Gran Turismo,but it's far better.If you put AI to 100% it acctually can give you a little real racing experience.So my conclusion is:This game has some issues but overall it's best game i played.I'd like it to be more like Race WTCC game,better AI,races feel more real and similar but it's nice looking.Best thing is that every car feels different.I use this game to practice for real racing because there is mod for Automotodrom Grobnik located in Rijeka,Croatia and looks pretty real because i'm driving on that track next year with my Honda.I would recommend this game for every car fanatic,racing fanatic or just ordinary gamer.Hope i helped!

												Best racing sim in a long time. Get that Ferrari 458 GT2 dialled in around Spa and you'll be grinning from ear to ear. Get a decent racing wheel and you can feel every little slip of the tyres, bump and knock. Now it's not without it's faults, for example there is no Rain or wet tracks, nor are there night events and the graphics aren't as pollished as some other SIM's but once you get used to the AWESOME physics and feel of the cars it's hard going back to any other racing SIM.

												It's an excellent hot lap simulator. Unfortunately that's all it is. And It's not worth 60 dollars.Kunos continues to be opaque with development, and throw tantrums during any criticism on the forums, banning people that complain. I'll sum it up.Online:Netcode is garbage. It's extremely difficult to join a race. Server browser sucks and doesn't have enough options. It's not as though that matters, because there's nobody playing.Single Play:The AI is nonexistent, so racing offline is a no. They simply don't recognize the fact that you're there. Smashing in to you in an attempt to stick their pre programmed lines. The penalty system is absurd. Two tires off the track and you'll have your speed cut. Get rammed by the braindead AI? Speed cut. Forced to swerve and cut a corner because the AI doesn't acknowledge you as ""there"". Speed cut. The Career mode is a joke. It never feels like you're doing anything or progressing in anything.There's a time attack mode that is...odd. And pointless, since there's no leaderboards.Simulation: ALMOST peerless. Everything feels super tight and realistic. The only thing that's lacking is the sound design and force feedback. The forcefeedback is absurdly high by default. You can fine tune this pretty easily, it just takes time. But the game doesn't seem to want to save my settings. I come back to the game to find my degrees of rotation back to a full 900 despite what I have set up in the in game profiler, and the stand alone one I have.The UI: Terrible. Everything feels extremely wonky. Once you have everything set up and are ready to drive. I'd say race but again, its a hot lap simulator, it opens it in a SEPARATE INSTANCE. Which makes streaming a nightmare.Even out of early access, and being out for a full year it's worth 30 dollars at best. There's not enough tracks, and not enough cars. There was dlc announced before the game was even released.The cars themselves look superb, but everything else looks last gen at best, ps2 era at theworst. This is mostly a problem with usermade tracks so its excuseable. Because the PC is starved for sims that have the latest roster of cars, this game is basically a must play. But buy it on sale. It's not worth full price. It wasn't when it was in EA, and it's not worth it now. I wouldn't spend more than 20 dollars on it. Almost every aspect of the game besides the driving feels incomplete or lazy.Edit December 2016, hope you like DLC.			",178,21,10,24,12,0,38

								The way the car's weight feels is more realistic than any other sim I've played. I've seen many videos of this on Youtube, but when I finally sat down to play this, it really threw me off guard of how impressive it really is.			",97,9,23,21,8,0,4

								There are games you should consider then there are games that you should buy.This one is one you should buy.Everyone loves cars, everyone loves loud cars, everyone loves fast cars, everyone loves classic cars, everyone loves gorgeous cars... This game has them all,It's a simulator in it's most basic description, handling is difficult, probably impossible with mouse and keyboard and playing with every aid turned off is a pain... However, there is no best feeling than mastering a old classic Lotus or taking a brand new Ferrari to the limit and hearing it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic sound breaking trough corners, this game is a rush9/10			",53,4,8,4,7,0,1

								I never played any racing simulations before. I was never interested on them. But when this game was on sale, I was eager to buy it. I just wanted to know what simulation was, because I just played arcade racing before.At first, I played it with controller. I played with it for about a month and I enjoyed it. But then I realized that I would get more fun if I used steering wheel, because it was simulation. So I bought G27 wheel. Of course it gave me more fun and I felt like I was driving in real life.The physics is amazing. Each car will give you different experience. Some cars are difficult to drive so you have to practice. The graphics is nice too. The tracks are accurate. But some contents and features are not in the game yet because it is early release.This is a must buy game for any simulation fans. Perfect game. 10/10.			",121,21,6,10,11,0,16

												I hummed and Arred and read mixed reviews. In the end i decided to download. I certainly wish I downloaded the game earlier while it was on sale. Whilst I have only played 5 hours so far, I can certainly see myself spending manny more on this game. The Mod Community is fantastic and there are so manny extra tracks and content you can download. This is the first game I have really been able to enjoy the use of my G27.  The feedback and sensation is just like a real car...This is a simulator, not arcade. I have read some reviews refferring to the cars behaving like boats or soap on the floor. The vehicle behaviour is ultra realistic and makes it really more fun. If your are after nitro boosts, arcard fun with bulletproof damage then go play need for speed. If you enjoy realism, Sims and a big modding community (I also enjoy Euro Truck 2) I would suggest you download the game. This game has put more smiles on my face in 5 hours then others have in weeks and months...			",11,5,2,3,6,0,1

												AC is a fantastic sim racer, with enough cars and tracks to improve your skills over the way!The single player is great, with more than enough challenges for you to beat...and is hard. #reallyhardThe thing here is the MP mode. This game is a blast online, but you have to make sure join a league, or playing with friends in order to race with good, and clean players.The audio is superb, the driving is great, with different feeling for each car.There are huge updates from the community (mods) download tracks, cars, accesories...The track visuals are so real (lasser scanned). The feel with terrain is awesome.If you own a Wheel there's no better experience./ Dont look further. warning!!!!!!!!THIS IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL NFS			",195,45,10,26,8,2,17

												I've spent a lot of time playing Assetto Corsa and it is without a doubt my favorite modern racing sim. There's not a lot I can say that hasn't been said already, but I do want to add that Kunos, the developer, has proved they are very committed to the long-term development of this game. Regular updates and upgrade and DLC packs make this game continually fresh, and the mod support is staggering. There's great sim racing communities around it. It really is a great sim, and I wholeheartedly recommend it.			",180,43,15,20,15,2,34

								This is one of the best games I ever bought. It might not have that many cars and tracks, but you can spend a lot of time even with one car and one track. Every car feels and reacts different. I spent hours upon hours discovering how a car behaves in certain situations, and how to drive it to its max.It is truly a lot of fun once you get the hang of it. I recommend playing this with a good steering wheel. I think this is the only way to really get the full driving experience out of this.I have spent around 150 hours so far, most of the time on track, but also a couple of hours in the replay mode trying to get a good angle for my next screenshot. And don't forget that this is still Early Access. Once it is finally out, with all the content, career- and multiplayer mode released, I think I can play this forever. And all this for only 35€, I have spent a lot more money on games not even half as good as this one. So if you love (sim-) racing or if you consider to try it out for the first time, you should definetely get it. It offers a great experience.			",26,1,10,0,1,0,1

												Assetto CorsaEdit: after a lot of playtime and some more DLC, i can safetly say Assetto Corsa is heading the right way, after the fist 2 Porsche packs we're released, i've had so much fun driving with my friends, you can modify pretty much anything in the game still, not much has changed, it just got better!The Best Track Racing Game i've ever played. period.I've been wanting to get a proper FFB Wheel for a long time, and this game made my decision, its probably the most customizable racing game out there, you can change the Menu, Cars, Tracks, EverythingDo you like Drifting?This is a game for youDo you like Track Racing?This is a game for youDo you like Free-roaming?This is a game for youThis game has everything, Kunos did a very good job on this Game, it isnt flawless tho:Multiplayer.I enjoyed Multiplayer quite a lot, but it has some problems that i cant ignore, first off, the Server Software is pretty... wellThere is no Maprotation, car Rotation, Mode Changes and running multiple servers on one host was impossible for me atleastChanging Cars was impossible without leaving the server and re-entering itThis game is probably the best thing you can get, it even has VR support, fully customizable wheel options etc, love it!One warning tho, you cannot assign a clutch button, only axle, so you cant use an H-Gate if you dont have a Wheel with clutch!

												TL;DR: The following review is inaccurate (because it is now a year old) and although the game has goen through huge improvements on the points criticised and other things, I still do not recommend this hotlap-simulator.Update: a year after, it seems like the netcode and AI have been updated and make the game become playable with other cars on the track. They added 4WD support and a few free cars next to the DLCs to show off this new feature of the physics engine. DLC #3 has been released, with some Lamborghinis, nice to see them deliver that promise. One of the Lambos in the game however is community content that has been promoted to be part of the official game (if I remeber correctly). All in all, if you are searching for some fun driving cars around track with great realism and don't care for AI or online multiplayer, you might want to try the game. Beware though, it is a simulator, so it is best played using a steering wheel, preferably a 900degree, so you can use the full lock of the cars.With the announcements of the Dream Pack #1 DLC I felt like I needed to warn potential buyers of this game.So here it goes:After having pre-purchased this game and having early-access being able to play the beta, it was a pretty good experience, the physics are okay most of the time and feel incredibly good with lower power rear wheel drive vehicles (eg: BMW M3 E30, BMW M3 E92, BMW Z4 E89, BMW 1 Series M Coupe, KTM Xbow, Lotus Evora SR, Lotus Elise SC)The front wheel drive cars do not feel that great to me, but as I am not a fan of these I will pass the subject.Now for the gameplay aspect:Menus are reasonably well designed and constructed, the options menus is very big with a lot of options (very nice to see). Just a little side note, menus are a seperate process from the game engine so you can let your PC cool down a bit between two races which is a nice segue to bring you to the graphics engine part of the game...Graphics, well oh boy... The optimisation... the obvious lack of thereof... The graphics look good but it's nothing extremely spectacular and yet I struggle to max out the settings and get a decent framerate (my system: 2-way SLI of GTX 680s, an i7 4770k @4GHz and 16GB of RAM)The in-game UI is very minimal and is not very well optimised for the multiplayer aspect of racing in my honest opinion, but Kunos has THE answer, modding... Yes, like the rest of the game, you can mod, and the UI is coded in Pyhton so you can either make your own or download one from someone else.I will not comment on multiplayer as my experience was sub-par to all the other simulations I've played but it was about 8-9 months ago so it might have changed.The AI is horrible absolutely not aware of you the race on rails they are not braking when you are and thus bump into you and thow you off track, the difficulty of the AI is also something strange... You, well I at least, can't keep up with the race leader, if you don't overtake the AI in the first 3 to 4 corners well the cars in front of you are going to vanish into the distance and you'll never catch up, interrestingly, if you turn the scenario the other way around, if you are the race leader, even if you don't drive that well and don't set lap records they'll never catch up (assuming you don't crash of course).So finally Assetto Corsa becomes a solo player hotlap simulator with... not a lot of content.37 cars of which probably half are just variants of the same car10 tracks where 3 of them have a second shorter variantA drag strip for quarter and full mileA dedicated drifting playground ""track""But this not a lot of content part will change in the same horrible fashion that game developpement has seen fit to go towards... Yes you guessed it, they have at least 1 DLC planned.Regarding the controls also very important to note, if you do not have a steering wheel... well do not try the keyboard and the controllers are a nightmare to use and to make it worse...You have to have a 900 degres steering wheel because the game supports it but also likes to map the 900 degres of rotation to a 270 degre steering wheel making the force feedback way too powerful and the steering way too sensitive and imprecise.Also apparently 45EUR (or your regional equivalent) is not enough... they want to add content but also fill their pockets because yes game devs also want to live they do not work for free, they are planning to release a DLC in the coming weeks... months...? but thanks to its naming scheme we know that it is far from the only DLC that is planned...What the F is wrong with game devs nowadays? Why DLC? Whay not wait to release the game for full price when the game is ready and finished, when there is content that make the game worth buying?At this point I don't know what I should do with it other than poke it with a really really long stick to see when new content is going to be added, and see how much the DLC will cost...As I generally do with any game that does include DLC in its roadmap... look at blizzard people please, they have a roadmap that says:1-dev2-bugfix3-release4-make sure everything is stable5-dev DLC*6-Bugfix DLC*7-release DLC*(8-repeat steps 4 to 7)* In Blizzard terms, DLC means expansion that is downloadable, your game does not tell you all the time ""this content is part of a DLC to unlock it buy the DLC"", no instead it doesn't show anything of it in-game, it does show however a nice thing on the Battle.net Launcher saying that there is an upgrade available for this game. A Blizzard expansion is typically more expansive than a DLC and for a good reason, it add a butt-ton of content and updates and patches and additional balancing and new awesome Pixar-like quality animations for cutscenes...PLEASE EVERYONE STOP BUYING DLC...And here isa little bonus (yay more text). It's the comment I left on the Assetto Corsa facebook page regarding the announcement of the Dream Pack #1 DLC:Not long ago they made something ""very fun and appropriate"". They released a video teaser of the contract deal they signed with Lamborghini in which they show 4 different cars that are not part of the game, and obviously advertises the game as having these cars in it when obviously no one has seen them in game... They're part of the upcomming DLC (not the lambos, these are clearly coming later)The modding aspect is great, allowing and encouraging modding is great. But making an engine adding 10-15 cars plus a racing variant of some of these cars and another engine another racing class (essantially the same model but with 300 HP instead of 350 and weighing 1100kg instead of 1250kg doesn't make it that different), 10 tracks and asking the community for their money and hard-work to make the game worth a damn by making mods, and asking to please not upload poor quality mods because it's an elite game, we want to have good content... (The please do not port is a genuine thing on the modding part of the assetto corsa forum, feel free to go and check it ot yourself)I am not happy about the money I spent on the game, it was too much for the content provided...I would prefer for them to remove their branding for the game, because frankly ""Your racing simulator""... Well it bloody hell isn't mine...Thanks for making it this far :)			",173,15,18,11,24,3,18

												Fun driving game for a lap or 2. I was going to give it a bash again and see if I could get into it, however, I have just seen a certain 'Stefano Castillo' abuse a fan (who is a professional driver) on the Assetto Corsa forum, who fairly and respectfully asked a question and pointed out a few things within the Sim.Stefano is apparently the 'KS (Kunos Studios) Dev. Programmer' and his reaction to someone who has no doubt spent some money on the base game and DLC's is absolutely ridiculous. Full off expletives it went on and on and on. This guy needs some help.If this response had been given by a BIG and professional developer, all hell would break loose in the marketing department. I have a feeling, with attitudes like that, AC is going the way of Project Cars.Sooooooooo promising but not quite finished in noticeable area's backed up by a bunch of rude, arrogant, vile people who do not care about who buys the game.Grand Prix 2 by Microprose is better.

												This game refuses to let me play a race, and the developer refuses to offer any support. Whenever I start a game it asks me to install Steam, which is rather odd because I launched the game from Steam. If I click install, it makes me quit Steam which makes me quit Assetto Corsa, and it reinstalls Steam; but will do the same thing if I try to start another race. If I click cancel and dont install Steam, it just takes me back to the main menu in Assetto Corsa.I emailed the developer about this, and their response was to post my question to their forum, and hope that another person who paid money for this game will tell me why this game refuses to acknowledge I have Steam installed. I sent a response saying this was unacceptable, and the developer refuses to respond to that. Are you serious? You're charging $50 for a game, you refuse to fix bugs which are worse than game breaking (i can't even start a game for it to break), and you refuse to offer any support at all. Dont waste your money on this, the developer has essentially abandoned the product, and is simply defrauding Steam users purporting that this game works and is actively supported.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A must-have for anybody interested in motorsport. The game runs well even on my current budget rig (AMD Athlon X4 760k, AMD R9 270, 8GB DDR3) and is easy to pick up and play with a controller. The game allows you to pick from a wide array of cars and tracks, and gives you the option to change each car's setup to your liking. Mod support means that you'll have plenty of community content to mess around with as well. DLCs also add more cars and tracks if you're serious about the game. The only negative I can think of is that people report a lot of ""rubber-banding"" and other latency issues during online play.			",88,6,3,6,17,2,16

												Apart from being not a fully finished game, having trouble with wanky AI Drivers, Server Connections and so on it's quite a good racing simulator. And it is a Simulator, which needs some practice and consistence. The amount of cars and tracks off-the-box isn't that high, but the quality of them is. Having a look at Spa for example, it's a great detailed and laser-scanned track, which is a sheer pleasure to drive at. Same thing with the stock driving vehicles - it's a reward if you learn to handle them. Of course, there is no rain like in pCARS, no night or weather at all, not that much eye candy stuff in Assetto Corsa. Kunos SImulazioni focused on the driving and the physics of the vehicles and with that it delivers excellent force feedback on many supported wheels. Probably the most outstanding thing is the modding community, as it's really active and gets sometimes even featured by KS, which is great. The driving community on the other side is like in almost every other game full of nerds, midskillers and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s alike. Don't expect the best experience, when you join a server with random people in it. ...oh and better wait at Spa and look how they manage to get the first corner after the start ;) Seriously, it's fun and if you're into cars anyway, check it out! Thumbs up here!			",342,78,18,55,52,7,63

												I have never ever enjoyed so much hot lapping in a racing game.I know it's a racing game but much of my time has been spent hot lapping because there is no racing game that has made it so enjoyable just taking in the car solo, one at a time. I'm beginning to start racing only after passing the 100 hours.Every track and car needs to be learned, just like in RL. If you don't know the track well you're not going to be competitive. The AI races with realistic aggressiveness, meaning they don't use you as a brake in corners. To me this is THE best racing game/simulation. I wished they had weather and night racing though. But as is, it's a perfect racing game/simulation that's friendly on the hardware.If you have some interest in racing game, whether you already own a wheel or otherwise, get this game. Enough said.

												Assetto Corsa is a half finished game and I cannot recommend it.  AC works fine as a hotlapping sim.  You'll ohh and ahh at the graphics but that's largely all there is here.  For something to be called ""your racing simulator"", there actually has to be racing involved.  It should be called ""Your Hotlapping Simulator"".- No Single Player Pit stops- No Rolling starts- No weather- No Night racing-The Single player portion is largely worthless.  The AI is not worth running against.  They run off track, run over each other, and run into the back and sides of the player.  -Each time Kunos ""improves"" their game, it breaks some other part (sound for modded cars, graphics, etc- The force feedback is far over exxagerated- The tire model is laughable compared to other sims and thus the reason it is changed with each patch.- you'll cringe at the CPU Occupancy errors stating your CPU is at 99 percent when while running a CPU monitor, it shows 60 percent usage-If you have Windows 10, forget about running this sim.  Devs on the official forums response is to reinstall windows or DDU your graphics drivers (in other words, they can't fix it).Wretched game In my opinion.  Had the refund option been in place when I purchased it, this turd would have gone back to Kunos.			",114,20,56,12,19,4,8

												Just got for myself a G27 after driving for years with a DFGT. With the proper gear, the gaming (driving) experience has significantly improved. This is by far the most satisfying simulation I've ever tried. The only software I can't compare is iRacing. Don't even doubt about getting the DLC, it's a MUST have.A brief list of pro and cons:PRO- great physics simulation (to be soon improved with 1.2)- great driving feeling, force feedback- top notch quality of official content- graphics quality and performance- audio immersion- tons of quality add-onsCONS- multiplayer is fine, but still needs improvement- AI as well (to be soon improved with 1.2) ",8,2,8,0,5,0,2

								if you're into racing simulators, it appears this is going to be the one to beat. Graphically it utterly trounces Gran Turismo and Forza, and as far as physics behavior, even in its very early pre-release stage, it ties or beats the latest iteration of Gran Turismo and leaves Forza far behind. Best of all, it's on the PC, not a console. If you're looking for an arcade racer like NFS, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a simulator, I can already tell this is going to be an incredible addition to the racing sim genre.			",292,37,4,13,33,0,51

												Jacko Rating 9.5/10Assetto Corsa is a brilliant simulation racer with especially good attention to detail and controller/Force Feedback.Let's breakdown the review into sections;General - This game provides a dozen different tracks with variations to these as extra tracks along with approx 60 cars depending on what DLC you have bought.  Its a real racer with many different settings in order to create the perfect simulation experience for you.  Hardcore racers can adjust things so its very difficult and beginers can tweak things down and turn on assists, a plethera of settings here.  You have various styles of racing from flag to flag or time trials and a campaign for single players as well as mutli player options and online leaderboards to keep you occupied.Graphics - Pretty slick but not as polished as perhaps Forza or Project Cars.  The details are there it is just not as eye poppoing as some other titles.  The tracks are to my knowledge a true to life depiction of the real ones and the cars are faithfully represented here.Audio - I found the audio to be very good with respect to the engine noises as well as the ambient sounds such as tyre squeels and exhaust backfires etc.  Music if you have it on is not bad but who cares when you are racing.Gameplay - Here is where the game excells and this is the best and the closest thing to real life racing I have ever played.  You will feel every bump, indent and parts of the tracks and the cars handle uniquely which means each one is a pleasure to master.  The feedback you get is amazing and this game begs for a proper racing wheel although you can still play and win with a controller.If you like real racing sims and prefer a detailed difficult racing game to a simcade then this game is for you.Superb, addictive and realistic sums up this pearl of a game.Race On!

Early Access Review
								Possibly the most promising racing simulator available on the market today.You can make a long list of comparison points between different racing sims. More content, better graphics, et cetera, but at the core every racing sim should be compared by the one thing they all share in common, the driving model.And this is where AC shines. The feel of the cars on the road are probably the closest any sim has come to replicating real life while importantly staying fun. Cars don't feel overly slippery and lack grip to add extra challenge and frustrate players. On the other hand they aren't glued to the track like arcade racers and can be difficult to control when pushing to the limit. It's a driving model that hooks you in and wants you to get better no matter the car you're in. Assists like traction control, stability control, ABS and driving lines also feature to help newcomers to racing sims get up to speed.While it might be a tad lacking in content in it's current early access state, the commitment to future content is evident and the quality of said content is fantastic. Highly detailed cars, authentic sounds and laser-scanned circuits meaning each official circuit in this game is as close as we'll likely get to actually racing the circuits ourselves. While Project CARS hogs the limelight with it's graphical quality and amount of official content, no car there truly feels as fun to drive there as they do in AC. And AC isn't a bad looking game at all might I add, check the screens and videos for yourself.To top it off, this game is also 100% moddable. The amount of custom cars and tracks already available in early access state is staggering and the quality of some of these is incredible. While PCARS might have more base content, it's lack of mod support limits it's future in the community, whereas AC could last for years with new content being released all the time by Kunos and it's playerbase respectively.Single player right now is limited to single race weekends and hotlapping, but a career mode of some fashion will appear when the game is fully released. Multiplayer is also constantly improving and already provides for excellent races that can only get better as the netcode is refined and more features are added.If you have a wheel, buy this now and you'll have no regrets. If you have a controller and want a racing game that's more challenging than any other racing game, buy this now and you'll have no regrets.			",346,79,37,25,20,5,26

A fleeting glimpse at what the game's developers hope to some day deliver.I love what I have seen thus far and  i do earnestly hope that the a fully fledged game arises from this, because I thoroughly enjoyed what they have accomplished thus far but don't expect a ""game"", if you purchase this title.  Think of the money spent as an investment in something that has enormous potential.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								Updated!Old conclusion:In the end there is no need to hesitate if you want a real race sim but didnt know which one to choose or if you want to take a break or step up from race ""games"" and want the real deal. You found it right here - Assetto Corsa!**Update**Ok, now i've clocked 500+ hours in Assetto Corsa, and what is my view now? It has changed - for the better.Content:We got more content since last time. A couple of cars and i think a track (Nurnburg GP). The latest of cars was the 98T - a mechanical monster! Raced in the 80's using carbon fiber and around 1300BHP with a weight of only 540Kg its fair to say its a scary beast, and beautiful modeling and execution regarding physics and FFB. Just as good as the other cars in this sim. The car is a thrill ride. Content wise we have a good range from street, super cars, GT and formula. And a good amount of laser scanned tracks that got character thanks to the collision layer which adds the bumps/dips/noise that our wheels go over which also translates awesomely to the wheel through FFB. Also worth mentioning is that Kunos landed more licenses and will give us more free content that wasnt promised at start. For one we will get the Corvette C7 included in the price! And a GT version will come in the much anticipated Nordschleife DLC. More about that further down!Multiplayer:Last time i wrote the review there was no multi player - there is now. And although lacking a bit its amazing fun. Funnier than any sim or race game ive done because of the excellent true to life physics and FFB. The new netcode that was just coded in the fluidity is great. Even driving against people across the planet they look smooth and you can have tight races - which is super. Very happy with the netcode upgrade to say the least. We also now have ""slipstream"" activated in MP which means you can go up behind someone and then get a boost from that cars ""air pocket"". This changes MP racing a lot!We also got FREEJOIN which means you can join in progress and even exit when you feel like it and change car if available (not during race). This is also a huge step up from earlier MP where you chose your car and that was it.Third good thing is that the admins are getting more and more power to force assists off. This came in the last patches and we can now force damage, fuel and tyre wear so the races get more equal. We are still waiting to be able to force Stability Control, ABS and TC, but im sure its coming very soon. This is where AC is lacking a little atm. Not being able to force all assists off and no real penality system yet. There will be however so its nothing to get hanged up on. Kunos even testing their own build with simple pitstops which was not announced for the 1.0 version. Maybe it wont come, but at least we know they are testing it. Good enough for me. So far they added things that were not scheduled for 1.0 so... :)Graphics:Kunos have upgraded the graphics by adding more effects and post processing. You can now make your own filter profiles and switch them while on track! So you tweak a lot of effects such as color, exposure, blur, vignette and a whole range of effects giving amazing results. You can make as many filters as you like and even share them with others. This way you can get great looking graphics without doing yourself but instead download a filter (or more) from someone else. Do you like realistic looking? More saturated with cool effect? Its up to you - you choose. No forcing by the developers. Just like it should be - freedom.Sounds:Nothing has happened in the sound engine since before, but(!) something IS happening as i write this. Luca, the sound master of Kunos is working hard to implement FMOD into Assetto Corsa! This is basically technology to have lots of effects on each sound. Reverb, occlusion etc. Trust me when i say that the cars will sound amazing when this gets implemented. Because FMOD has a good track record in other games like Forza 5 for example plus a whole range of other games. It will make a huge difference. Looking forward to this big time because sounds are one of the greatest immersion creators in games/sims. Hell, in any entertainment!Mods:Kunos (the developers) already released the tools for track/cars finalizing, and we already seen lots of tracks and a bunch of cars already. Some of the cars are top notch quality with amazing modeling, phyics and sounds. Some scratch made tracks have been made as well and they are equally amazing. These things take time to create and perfect so we also got a ton of track conversions from other sims/games (with permission) and i dont lie when i say that the track number have exploded! And from here and forward there will be more and more and more. Kunos endorse modding and help any way they can so this title will have a large library of tracks, cars and apps to enjoy.DLC (or further development of AC):So far the first DLC will be the grand track Nordschleife, and of course its being laser scanned with the latest techniques. Every little dip/bump will be there and every object around the track is in its correct place. This DLC will also feature 10 GT cars. Some of them includes Corvette, RUF and Nissan. There might be more to this DLC, but we have to wait and see. Me and everyone i know is looking forward to it big time. I hope Kunos will be able to sustain themselves by making juicy, meaty DLC's with content we racers want. There is a classic DLC as well i think with SPA and a lot of old powerful cars. Lots to look forward to since Kunos have stated they will improve and build on Assetto Corsa for 5 years!Final word:As you can imagine, as a simmer and race fan i cant get enough of AC. Mainly because of the physics and FFB which is at top class. Any sim/race game i try i cant stay long because its miles away from the feeling of AC. This sim feels like driving a real car, and its challening and tons of fun. Races are very intense thanks to that, and its easy to get addicted to the feeling. Kunos goes the extra mile making sure Assetto Corsa will be in the top which we see when they keep adding things that was never on the agenda from start. They keep improving the sim beyond what i thought they would which is amazing. And its taking its time because they are but a few very talented developers, but its worth its wait because the sim is already a meaty excellent driving experience, and i cant wait to see and play it in a couple of months time. Its almost so i want to freeze myself to see how excellent it is in the near future, but at the same time i cant stop playing it so thats a no go. I will just have to continue enjoying myself and take it as it comes. :)Long review. Im not good at writing them, sorry for that. But i still stand by what i wrote at first. If you want to feel that you drive a REAL car then AC is for you. The driving experience is already there and the details around it is being built up patch by patch. Kunos have impressed me, and im not easy to impress since i require depth and authenticity. Also a big plus is developers who stay close to their customers and listen, and they do. So, im totally sold on this experience and i hope to see you too on the track soon! ;)PS. the price they ask is low, very low, for a high end product as this one. This is the same type of simulator real car companies use!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I've been playing driving sims for a few years now and this is without doubt the best ever. It's not just the beautiful graphics/artwork, the handling physics are by far the most advanced too. I'm usually a multi-player junkie but at the time of writing this (early access), the MP hasn't been released yet but I've already clocked up more than 115 hours just hot lapping. Not something I've done with any other game.If you like driving games, whether sims or arcade, this is a must buy for you!The developers, Kunos Simulazioni, are a small team of 12 Italian guys with a passion for cars, fast cars. They have out done the competition not only with their product but also with their support in forum, ironing out bugs and issues that have to be expected at beta stage, but also listening to suggestions from the community to make the game better for everyone.  All of the cars have been meticulously reproduced to an exacting standard. Telemetry data has been gathered directly from the manufacturers of every single car and applied to the unique physics engine to give the most accurate driving/racing experience possible to date on a PC or console.They have also laser scanned every inch of every track, including Silverstone, Imola, Monza and many more. And thanks to a community vote, laser scanning of Nordschleife is due to start soon for release in Sept 2014!Anyway, enough typing from me. It's time to get back to the Ferrari F40 at Imola!

												This simulator is, with its excellent performance easily hitting the hundreds of frames per second in some cases, a gift to the virtual reality community. With such a steady and high framerate, unlike its competitors, Assetto Corsa does NOT constantly rely on framerate smoothing mechanisms like Asynchronous Timewarp, rather delivering VR's required 75 or 90 frames per second without problem.I've had the honor of trying AC in both the Oculus DK2 and the consumer model. It's quite a treat as it rivals iRacing in terms of fluidity and smoothness, while not being a massive hit on the bank. An excellent choice for your first VR simulator pick!I must stress the fact that SteamVR/HTC VIVE owners would rave over this title if it had support implemented for it. Given SteamVR doesn't make use of Asynchronous Timewarp, it's software like this that'll benefit SteamVR because the game can simply keep up the headset's required framerate without a single hitch. I highly encourage the devs of AC to continue this awesome VR support and consider doing with SteamVR as well! VIVE owners will love you for it!Video first impressions with the Oculus Rift CV1

												As a simulator this game is absolutely incredible. The physics are a bit unforgiving if you drive beyond your limits, as it should be. Furthermore, the graphics look wonderful (Use the Glide filter to prevent brightness adjustment, by the way) and the selection of cars both mod and official are pretty decent.As a racing game in today's market, it's not that great. Single-player AI is pants-on-head stupid, the track selection is incredibly small, and multiplayer is almost entirely unplayable at 200+ ping. Official leagues don't exist, public lobbies are filled with idiots, and you'll rarely ever find a good room of people using any of the more interesting disciplines, like the Lotus Eleven.If you are a racing simulation enthusiast, this is a decent choice for you. I love driving the Mercedes 190E DTM around the Nordschleife, right where it belongs. The tracks are all very well done, and some of the mod tracks and cars are unbelievably fun and/or to AC's laser-scanned standards. Lake Louise is a fun loop around the Canadian Rockies, and Bridgehampton is just as bumpy as you'd expect a race track situated in Long Island to be. You can drive a Supercharged Cobra 427, but you can grab the mod with the Competition and Street versions as well. There's also a very good NA Miata mod.If you are anything but an enthusiast, maybe hold off until there is a bigger selection of cars and tracks, or find a different sim to play. I can't recommend this game because SPR is almost broken and MPR is unplayable, if not frustrating.			",24,5,16,1,5,2,1

												EDIT: Ok, so i have lightened up a little since last time. Since the 1.5 update i have been playing it sporadic, with so much love that i almost cant explain it. But it still misses out on rain wich i think it's a disgrace to the Ayrton Senna legacy, if they continue to let it out. Monaco too.... So my thumb stays down until further notice. No rain no gain.  ""The waaaiting is the hardest part"" Tom Petty once sang. I think it describes this sim perfectly since there are lots of promises but no will of doing them justice.  Green hell with DLC cars was kinda expected september this year but we still havent seen it. It's a good racing game but the waiting is the hardest part as said before.  I will certainly never buy an early access game ever again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								For shear driving pleasure out on the track, Assetto Corsa is where it's at. I'm yet to find a game that does my G27 justice in the way that Assetto Corsa has - On the limit of grip the feedback is superb and the physics/handling seem bang on to me. Whilst this is still an early build of the game and the content/features are a little light, what is there is fantastic. I have high hopes for future development of this game. In particular, a few Japanese cars wouldn't go a-miss. To summarise: if you're a motorsport fan, BUY IT! 9/10 for what's currently present.			",72,5,18,13,7,1,12

												In the old days of PC racing games - and by old I don't mean too old but think mid 2000s, there weren't many choices. Sure, there are plenty of arcade racers, but many of them unfortunately were forgotten and relegated to the proverbial dustbin of history (though there are ones that still thrive, like TrackMania and Whiplash). As for more realistic games, there were a few titles PC players could choose from; Simbin with their GTR2 and Race 07 titles, ISI with rFactor, Papyrus (RIP) with Nascar Racing 2003 and even though they were incredibly arcadey, EA's Need for Speed, among others. However, two franchises never came to PC and stayed console only - those being Gran Turismo (for PlayStation), and Forza (for xBox). And PC players, myself included, yearned for a great racing game that had the graphics of those games whilst the level of realism offered by more hardcore games like the SimBin games or rFactor. This isn't to say PC didn't have good games, but what the consoles got was something else altogether. Fast-forward a few years and here we have a game developed by a small Italian firm named Kunos Simulazioni. Their goal was to produce a realistic racing game that has the intricate graphics offered by console games (at least, that's what I gather with this game; I assume that's what the devs were going for). It was given a fancy Italian name because what is more Italian than race cars? I digress, but anway, Assetto Corsa, when it was first released, was eye opening. Who would've thought that a game of this caliper would come to PC? Granted, Kunos aren't exactly a new firm; they did produce NetKar Pro, but I've never played that game, so I cannot say what it is like. However, what I can say about Assetto Corsa is this: it's a really good game, but it does have some issues.The first thing I noticed about this game after setting up my race wheel was the force feedback. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ the force feedback is incredibly well done. The fact that you can actually feel the road while driving is astounding, and because of this gives me confidence in what the car is doing. Every kerb, every crack in the road is felt but not exaggerated, making playing fun and exciting. It makes rFactor's limited force feedback feel like mushy peas in comparison. I will say this; you might've noticed I said ""race wheel."" Yes, this is a game that benifits incredibly from a game wheel with force feedback, or at the very least, a controller with force feedback. Keyboard control is possible, but it detracts from the game and using a keyboard removes one of the most highly praised parts of the game. The game is more than just force feedback though. What I really like about this game is how easy to drive a good number of cars are. I know a lot of people are going to say ""but the GT3 cars should be incredibly twitchy and nervous and blah blah blah"" but hear this: GT3 cars are meant for regional racing series (like Blancpain, Super GT GT300, or Dutch Supercar Challenge) and also meant for ""gentleman drivers."" What is a gentleman driver? Simply put, someone with limited (or in some cases, no) race experience that wants to race. It's no wonder these cars are going to be easier to drive than say, the Lotus 98T or the Ferrari 312T or even the new McLaren F1-GTR. Sure, there are some hard to drive cars in the game; the 3 I mentioned earlier are good examples of that. However, not everything requires superhuman skill to drive. And for that, I give Assetto Corsa high marks. I also love the tracks; they are incredibly well done and I love the atmosphere that surrounds them. Whether it is something as primitive or ""organic"" as the Nordschelife or as high tech as the Nurburgring GP circuit, you get a good idea on how the track feels. And finally, no more awkward versions of Spa! The one in this game is one of the most realistic versions out there.Onto graphics; what can I say? They're great. Just take a look at some screenshots. Kunos has easily matched the graphics level of the console games, with highly detailed car models and tracks. The UI is unobtrusive, though can get a bit clunky trying to select cars and skins. Sounds are for the most part good, though there are some better third party sounds available. I guess that is a good thing since they can be replaced, but by the same token you'd think Kunos would've done good sounds themselves; I guess it was a cost issue. Oh well.Now the things this game needs fixed, and there are a bunch of them.First is netcode in multiplayer. Quite frankly, it needs reworking. A small tap from one car could send another car flying off like some sort of Newton's Cradle. It's hilarious at first, but there needs something to be done about that. Sure, at high speed having cars bounce off each other in two different directions makes sense but not while the cars are going 20 or so mph. Multiplayer racing, while good for the most part, does need improvement because of that. Second is optimization and stability, which this game needs. I know piling on mod after mod can make the game more unstable, but ever since the game started using FMOD for sounds I have been having more and more sound crashes, making playing a sort of ticking time bomb. It especially sucks when you're on a great hotlap and suddenly the game goes six feet under. Optimization is sorely needed as well. I understand with the Dream Pack update there were CPU optimizations brought in, which is great, but there need to be graphic ones as well. Third is the general state of the game. And I don't mean ""Is this game going to die out or not"" because right now I feel that Kunos is doing its best to keep the game ship shape. However, what direction does Kunos want to take this game in? As a hotlap game, it's great, but put any sort of AI racing and it's quite frankly subpar. Multiplayer has its own issues to deal with, and on top of that the game has probably one of the most insipid penalty systems in any racing game. Going off track - even if there is no advantage gained - grants you either a 10 second penalty OR you have to slow down to 30MPH. This is incredibly dumb and in multiplayer situations it can lead to some stupid crashes. I know the first thing people will say is ""well don't go off track"" but let's face it; you are bound to go off track sooner or later. But back to what this game wants to be; does it want to become the next rFactor? the next Gran Turismo/Forza? Or both? It is hard to say, and maybe Kunos doesn't know either. In all, this is a great racing game, and is a breath of fresh air that PC players desperately needed. The collection of cars and tracks is great, and the modding community is thriving, producing some content that rivals the stock content. Would I recommend buying it? Yes, but if it's on sale with the DLC as well. And when Kunos does fix the issues and takes the game in whatever direction they choose, the game will be on every PC racer's bucket list to play.

My experiences have taught me that there are mostly serious racers in lobbies who have no interest in damaging you or themselves.Add the Dream Pack DLC to enjoy more awesome cars on the most accurate rendition of the Nordschleife, which was laser scanned.If you're a racing fan, you want this.

								this is a very VERY amazing game, even as an unfinished product it feels even better than any other finshed retail sim . The graphics are stunning and the couple of cars you can currently drive are very detailed and beutiful in their own special ways. The sounds are very good and the game itself feels very good to drive. I highly recommend you buy this, more things will get added over time for no cost and the current game is well worth the 39$ if not more than that.Anyone with some spare money and a passion for cars/racing should buy this game, you will not regret it ",85,4,7,7,6,1,0

												After enjoying racing sims for the past seven years AC will hopefully keep the enjoyment coming.I'm very keen on seeing how the multi-player turns out and how strong the league scene will be.I much prefer league racing over pick up racing ( iRacing official series / open servers ) as league racing tends to be a lot cleaner.As i can only really do one night a week for league racing ( work reasons ) I am also hoping for a good single player experiece.From the few hours I've spent on AC I'm very impressed with how the cars handle, especially at low speed corners where some sims behave very enexpectedly.Any mishap is clearly a ""oh I did this or that wrong"" not a ""WTF"" moment.Graphics wise i have no problems getting 90FPS running triple monitors with a GTX680 at moderate settings.Hopefully AC will still do more optimizing so when we have multiple cars on track the frames won't take a nose dive.All in all I'm impressed with what I've seen so far and infact have gifted AC to one of my sim racing friends.edit: In fact make that gifted to two friends.

												I'm a real life driver. No I don't mean professional driver or track day'er. I drive to work, Tescos and so forth like the typical player. I was looking for a game that gave me a ""realistic"" feel in terms of acceleration, braking, turning, road feel etc. Asseto Corsa delivered with flying colours or shall I say my Thrustmaster TX did? Actually no, I've played a few ""arcade"" / semi simulated games and this by far gives you the best force feedback as if you were driving on a real road surface (I haven’t Project Cars but i read the reviews for both before choosing Asseto Corsa.. the consensus was that AC had a more realistic feel).Interestingly I decided to use my real life car around the track but had opportunity to coach with an amateur rally driver. He gave my some tips when cornering/braking for turns. That worked well on the real life track so I thought I would apply the exact same concept to Asseto Corsa... Before my ""real life"" lesson, the Nürburgring (Tourist)I was hitting around 7.30ish with the 599 XX (admittedly that was slow in general)... When I applied real life track day tips, my time reduced to around 6.58. Let that be the testament of translating real-life driving to their in-game physics engine are phenomenal. Whenever I play AC, it DOES feel like I'm driving a real car.That said it does just feel like when you play online, you are just competing to show off lap-times so it can get very tiresome if you encounter some of the “professional drivers in Asseto Corsa who take the game extremely seriously..” ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So as far as realism goes, Very good. Looks over all, Very good. Online mutiplayer, garbage. Carreer mode, meh at best. PROS: Looks very nice while playing. The driving aspect is good through controller and a wheel is best! (DUH)  Tracks are fun, and the variety of cars is great.CONS: I started out with Career mode. Let me tell ya. Borin as hell. No realistic feel what so ever. They are dumb AI. Single line race and easy to predict. Easy to get first place. Dont even have to finish the race. Get in first place and just stop in front of the other cars and watch them retire. Then you can retire and walla.Mutiplayer: (sigh) This is where it all goes wrong! I was hoping for a very fast pace join in and race game. This is not it. Join in and watch peeps screw off is more like it. Trying to get the feel for the track/qualifying is a problem simply due to the other people. There are always people crashing into you for fun.  Starting  a race can take up to 20 mins before any magic starts to happen, and when it finally does start, you got those peeps that are not serious and want to crash. I thought thats what GTA is for. Over all It doesnt take long before I sign into a another game and have a dissapointed view of this game. THE FIX: Dont play this game, Play a different one. (For me at least). My friend who convinced me to get this game say's otherwise.			",11,0,1,2,1,0,2

												I love this game. I really do. But I can not recommend this game at all. I bought this game when it was in early access for about $35.00. I have watched this game grow into what it is today and now you can just see greed taking over the developers, I have spent 120+ hours waiting for new cars with every update but now they have DLC. It would be even worse for the people who bought this game now for $55.00.  So on top of the original price tag of $55.00 people still need to pay $17.00 for the dream pack. What an utter display of corporate greed. (They also say that it is their first dream pack that came out and implying that there are going to be more. I'm sorry but no. I just can't recommend it.)

								this game is good for single player like time trials but if your someone looking for a  game with good multiplayer and good ai this is not the game for you the multiplayer bearly works but i can let it get away with that being it just came out but the AI though is bad and has not been fix and they have had plenty of time to get the AI in a reasonable stat. the AI is horredous they have no awareness what so ever they just plough into you and ram you off the track if your in the way but as of right now this game is useless unless you just want to do hotlaps and time trials. however the driving physics ae fantastic but in its current state i cannot recommend due to lack of good AI and the other things listed above . i will  update this review if these things are sorted but as of right now this is my review sorry for th poor spelling			",131,22,29,8,21,1,13

								This is the most realistic racecar simulator at this date. The real next generation in simracing. I've tried every other software possible in my quest to learn driving fast and this comes closest to reality. Even at it's early stage without multiplayer or AI it's a joy to drive around on the beautiful, laser scanned tracks. If you don't like snap oversteering, unexplainable spins and strange car behaviour, give this title a chance. You'll not be disappointed.			",45,11,8,3,2,0,7

												This game feels just great. It looks good as well. You get plenty of cars and tracks and probably more in the future. You get the option to modify your car exactly to the way you like it.Is it all great then? No. the penalty system is idiotic. You get your braking wrong and slide of the track and get a 5 second penalty and you must slow down to 50 km/h or lose your throttle for 5 seconds. It also gives you the penalty if some maniac pushes you off the track which is frustrating.Overall I'd say this game is good fun, and if the devs remove the current penalty system it might be the best racing game in the history of the universe ( and whatever was before that ).

You get the option to modify your car exactly to the way you like it.Is it all great then? No. the penalty system is idiotic. You get your braking wrong and slide of the track and get a 5 second penalty and you must slow down to 50 km/h or lose your throttle for 5 seconds. It also gives you the penalty if some maniac pushes you off the track which is frustrating.Overall I'd say this game is good fun, and if the devs remove the current penalty system it might be the best racing game in the history of the universe ( and whatever was before that ).

								It might lack the 'shiney' of a certain near to release driving game/sim but this has BUCKETLOADS of playability.  The handling of each vehicle so far is amazing.  I have played a lot of driving games, barring full sim games like RFactor, and you really can feel each wheel through the steering wheel.  You can instantly feel which rear wheel is stepping out and can react accordingly before it is to late.  The in cab camera view is spot on.  The way it tilts into the corners is sublime.  It is so well done you don't even notice it, which to me means it is just right.I play this with my G27 with a brake modification and everything just works perfectly.  It is one of the very few driving games I haven't had to spend hours calibrating.I have one very minor gripe, which I add is a personal thing, I find the menu system quite clunky and a little unclear in what you are setting up.  Having said that this game is still in early development and i wouldn't be surprised if this is revised at some point.Absolutely love it.  If you are a fan of driving games this is a MUST.Remember gameplay over shiney is always king. ",282,114,39,22,26,7,28

												All right I've just redone this review 8/9/2015 at 1:00A.M. Okay so let me put it this way in level of realism from lowest to highest  Project Cars> Assetto Corsa > Iracing. Iracing is in fact the MOST realistic sim out there in terms of physics, handling, and car behaviour in general due to its laser  scanning and ultra realistic tire models so thats what you would get if you were 100% serious about sim racing (I have all 3 of these sims). Unfortunately its not budget having to pay for cars tracks and subscriptions so the next best thing for simmers is this. The physics arent as good as Iracing but they are waaayyy more realistic than Pcars. The graphics also being pretty decent with being slightly better than Iracing (Iracing has AMAZING reflections on the cars). If your just starting out this is good game for you to get into sim racing (YOU NEED A WHEEL TO SIM RACE) if you have something like a G27. I'm not rich so when I upgrade I can't get any direct drive wheels ($2000 each) so I'm getting a fanatec after being in the sim racing community for a while. So I'm going to kinda do a comparison for all of you here of all three games to see what best suits you. I have been playing sim games since GT Legends (thats where I started) so I'm pretty aquainted with racing games by now and you can trust my info on this though this is not my most playes sim racer.   Pcars                              -Best Graphics              -Arcade physics            -Decent Tracks            -Large track variety         -Most Cars (no mods)        -Well modeled cars          -No Mod support                 -Controler recomended   -Offline play              -Decent Price -Good for fun   Assetto Corsa  -Middle Graphics-Semi Sim physics-Decent tracks-Decent track Variety-2nd most cars (no mods) -Well modeled cars-Mod support-Controler not recomended-Offline Play -Decent Price-Good for begining simmers   Iracing-Worst graphics (of the three)-Full blown sim physics-Laser scanned tracks (realistic)-Decent Track Variety- Least cars (No mods)-Extremely detailed cars-No mod support-Controler Not recomended-No offline play-Expensive-Good for experienced simmersI hope this helped all who read have a better grasp on these games to make a wise decision on what they shoudl buy based on what they need and what these three sims have to offer. If you found this helpful please give me a thumbs up so others can see. Thank you for reading and I hope all of you have fun out there racing!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This review is more for controller users:Assetto Corsa is nothing short of fantastic. Physics are phenomenal, even at an alpha state. Graphics are very good, and the gameplay customisibility(modding support) are just great bonuses to the game. I have tried this out on a G27 on my friends account and the steering wheel is obviously the preferred way to play this game. Nothing will match that in terms of preciseness and accuracy to actually driving the real thing.Now for controllers. I have an Xbox One controller. When I first played the game, it gave me the CPU occupency level of over 95%. I can tell that it's just a bug and the work around for it, while it is tedious, is completely fine. Just set the Xbox One Controller as a steering wheel and manually map out the commands. Xbox 360 Controllers already have a profile so it's good to go, but if you have an Xbox One controller, it's best to manually set it up, until the future patches come in enabling full support of the XOne. Gameplay with the controller : This game is just straight up difficult with the controller unless you sink in a lot of hours, fiddle with the setup and find a good setup. I am about 3-6 seconds slower than a wheel time that I see on YouTube on Monza, depending on the car. Keep in mind this should get better once I understand the corners, braking points, and set ups to how the cars work as I move forth with the game. Is the game playable with the controller? Simple answer: Yes. There are people who say it isn't but it is playable. You just need to have patience and fiddle with the settings ALOT to find your ""cup of tea."" After that, you will get better. I assure you. If you buy this game and you have a controller, be patient. Don't give up. Stay focused on your driving and be ready to troubleshoot your errors like no other. This is an amazing driving simulator. It is not an arcade game. Give feedback to the developers about your controller settings and just keep on at it. You will learn to love this game. I know itWheel users, do yourself a favor and buy this game. What are you waiting for? Stop reading this review. You shouldn't have been reading it. You have a wheel. This is a simulator. It's like PB and J, Cookies and Cream, Cheese and Pizza. If you're not into that stuff, just know this. Your wheel will love the game more than you do.9/10 (Due to controller support but it should be fixed in the upcoming patches).Happy Driving :)***Edit as of 12/23/2014*** The game is out as a 1.00 release, and while to some, it doesn't feel like a complete release, it is definitely WAYYY better than it was when I did this review. The controller issue got fixed for me so the game is a beauty to play. This is a must have for driving enthusiasts.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is becoming the benchmark simulation racer, and the force feedback is one of the very best already in this early stage. The bi weekly updates introduces new cars, tracks and game modes all up until the final release in Q1 2014. It's a bargain to buy this with 22% off. It's amazing to just drive hot laps for hours due to the fantastic physics engine in Assetto Corsa!Just buy it; if you're the least interested in sim racing this is a safe bet. Simple as that.

												Having been with this from the start i have to say this game is a ""Must"" own for any racer, if you haven't bought it already then now is the time. Beautiful modelling and handling, coupled with modding, this game has a bright future. Still a long way from where it could be in respects to UI and Race Rules, but that will come in time. I would like to see safety cars, flags, etc. Option for rolling starts etc. Oh and of course 24 hour racing with rain :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great all around package, boasting some of the best road cars around, flashy yet crisp graphics, and a very good looking UI compared to the competitors. It's not the top simulation on the market, but it is a great stepping stone for those looking to move beyond simcade games into something  more realistic. While playable with a contrroller, you definitely want a full force feedback wheel to get the most out of this one. Below I will go over the pros and cons in a bit more detail:Pros    -the graphics look fantastic, and it isn't too demanding on your PC to get a beautiful looking race environment            - the physics, while not mind blowing, are more than sufficient to provide decent racing, and fun driving, particularly the road cars. Definitely leaps and bounds above what gran Turismo, Forza and PCars are doing in this department             -the car selection is great. While other games have done race cars to death, Assetto Corsa has the best selection of road cars around, from Ferraris to Mustangs and everything in between. It also has race cars, but the road cars really stand out, and with the above average physics and great graphics, it really makes for a truly immersive experience              -the laser scanned tracks are extremely detailed and stunning to look at, really bringing the experience together-BEST.DRIFTING.ANYWHERE......yes, you can drift here. Yes, it is awesome               -Force feedback isn't the best on the market by any means, but it gives you a good idea of what your car is doing and will help you master the art of controlling it. Still, above average and better than most everything other than GSCE and RFactor 2                -Updates. Kunos is always updating and improving Assetto Corsa, along with releasing more content. We are on Tire Model 7, and have had 3 dlc packs, free content, and have more being relesed all the time. Japan pack today!!!               -The mods. This title has a great modding community behind it, many modders carried over from RFactor, who put out tons of quality content. The mods work great here, and much of the time are indistinguishable from stock content Cons     -The sounds are far from perfect, and a greater range is needed (a bit bland, need to work on the highs and lows for the growls and whines of real cars). UPDATE: The Japan pack is a step in the right direction, and with a high quality set of headphones, they actually have quite decent range             -The AI started off as some of the worst anywhere, slow and stupid. They have since greatly improved, but they still need a good bit of work. Sometimes they are randomly aggressive, but can end up in a train, ""racing"" single file if your unlucky. It's hard to find a good match for your skill level, 98% I beat them on most tracks, 100% and I rarely see them beyond lap 3             -The online competition. I can't really fault Kunos for this, but while better than the Gran Turismo/Forza crowd, you still do get a lot of noobs and wreckers. I think it's mostly because, as I mentioned before, Assetto Corsa is used as a stepping stone from racing games to true simulations. Maybe I am just spoiled  from iRacing and RFactor 2 Leagues, but I am yet to have a race where half the field is still racing by lap 5. It could really do with a skill matching/ranked racing system.As you see, the pros far outweigh the cons, and Assetto Corsa is a worthy purchase for any sim racer or car afficianado. With a sense of realism foreign to most gamers, it will have you kicking the backend around corners and fighting to gain each second. It still is far from perfect, and I still prefer RFactor 2 physics, and iRacing's competitive racing, but to just hop in a dream car like a Ferrari 458 or Corvette Stingray and tear up the track, Assetto Corsa reigns supreme. And with the constant inprovements, updates and new content being released all the times, who knows what the future of this title holds.  A solid 8/10 from me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm not a big gamer, I only ever play the Nurburgring, I use a Logitech G25 with separate shifter and pedals. I'm in my mid 40's with a family so can't spend day in day out practicing. I've driven the real Nordschleife 'tourist' circuit in a Jaguar XF Sport with other real cars on track too. (I'd like to see complete random cars on track, that start in random positions of the circuit when you do a free practice for added realism!) I got this game on early access (and spent most of my time on Monza until the Nurburgring made it's glorious appearance.) So this review is ONLY based on a comparison for aforementioned track. I run a Crossfire R290 reference setup on a 32GB Asus ROG Tytan (i7-4970)  so graphically, my setup should handle anything and everything I throw at it. Assetto Corsa looks great, Project CARS looks a bit greater however the ForceFeedback on PCars is awful. AC on the other hand gets it spot on. Touch a rumble strip in AC, you rumble. Touch a rumble strip in PCars, nothing. (most of the time.) PCars offers more in the way of variety and content (a lot more to be honest) but if I'm after a quick(ish) lap of my favourite track, I come back to AC. It's not quite as pretty but plays much better with a heightened sense of reality that I look for in a Sim.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have change my mind about this game for several reasons. This game is NOT complete, if you have brought it wanting and expecting a £35.00 (At the time of writing) game, then you are going to be dissapointed. Don't let them fool you this IS still in early acsess.A list of things that are broken:Most conserningly for a 'complete' game, the A.I is the worst I have seen in a racing game in along time. They do not know where you are on the track, and will in effect ram you off the road by overtaking in the worst points. This also means that the career is only possible if you are on easy and some kind of God. Also it makes any race very annoying. I may not be the greatest driver, but getting more than third in most races in impossible.The down-shifting is broken. It will wait untill the car is at 3000 RPM untill it changes down.You need a wheel, otherwise it is unplayable, meaning it in NOT a relaxing game to sit down and play.There are some, good things, one major thing is that the handling physics ARE good, but you will only get 20 hours gameplay max from hot-lapping.My outcome is that this game is to damn expencive.(P.S I do relise that the dev's put alot of hard word into this game, and I think that this game, whilst in my OPINION is not the greatest at the moment this COULD be an exquisit game. It just not worth £35.00 yet. I will continue following this game and I will change this Review when the next big update comes out)Also my wheel's rotation sensor is broken, but this is the ONLY game in my Steam game list that does not fix this temporarly, meaning on this game, 90% of the time I have to go through long lists to get force feedback working properly, taking sometimes upto 30 mins to fix this, EVEN GTA 5 DOES THIS!

								Updated: 12 Feb, 2016Here I will put some changes that I saw:Graphics is now excellent. The blurred image was a bad configuration setup. The environment could be better but in general is great.More cars avaible! Ok, we need to pay DLC, but its not expensive.Carrer mode is not so exciting but its ok.Dirigibility is improvedIA is much much better (not perfect)!Still my favorite simulator!!! 2nd one is Dirt Rally.Posted: 25 Nov, 2013 @ 8:00pm	Buy this game ! Especially if you like simulators !This game has all the quality I was hoping for a simulator, a few points I raised :Sound : Awesome, I liked the sound of cars, environments , incredible detail .Graphics: Still needs to be polished, the game is heavy yet, the image is blurred and the track is missing more texture detail.Cars and tracks Laser scanned !Many cars are coming, we have cars from lower classes or supercars for all tastes, even F1 cars and antique cars ! Very detailed , each with its unique driveability !Dirigibility ( turning point ) : I loved the simulator , I can feel the cars perfectly in my hands ( G27 ) , something that I was waiting for is the H gear with clutch(like real life) and this game has!We now have career mode in a simulator on PC ! Always wanted a game with career mode on PC and now we have !Uncomplicated : You can increase the complexity of the game by setting the car the way you prefer , but if you simply enjoy running without spending hours and hours configuring every car on every track you can too!It is amazing , love it! I am doing this review because he really liked this game and want to support this development .I made this review based on experience in the following games :GT Legends , GT , GTR , GTR 2 , GTR Evolution , RACE 07 and all expansions , RaceRoom Racing Experience, Gran Turismo 5 , Richard Burn Rally with RSRBR 2013 FIA WRC 4 WRC 3 , Project CARS , F1 2013 Game Stock Car 2012 GRID 1 , 2 , DIRT 1,2,3 , Euro Truck Simulator 2 , rFactor 1 ( very little )			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Profile says ~150 hours on record but believe me with Steam offline, it's well over 2000.I'll attempt to explain what I like and dislike about the game.Great WIP game for $30. Once it's polished up & bugs ironed out(which will take a considerable amount of time), it will be worthy of $60 even if you're not that into sim racing. Just cruising on the roads, keeping the car straight,  heel-and-toe downshifting to keep the rear in-check and pull out with speed is believeable and exhilarating. If you can drive. The sensation of speed is amazing. But if you are into sim racing what are you waiting for? pick this up and start hotlapping like your life depends on it!I must however note, regarding the price: Be prepared to pay even more if you want to race online with more people because of DLC limitations. Yes, most people race with the DLC so if you want to race them, you'll need to buy the official DLC just to be in the same lobby. Alternatively, if people are racing with only base content and modded content, you'll have to guess where to download it from...most cases...Racedepartment website...otherwise (rarely) I have no clue.I must also note as far as AC as a ""game"" is concerned, isn't stellar. If you're one to play racing games for the Career you might want to look elsewhere, you might. Bit boring in presentation, & lacks any sort of narrative(currently) that said, it does have a few modes: Career, Drag Race, Drift, Special Events, Race Weekend, Time attack, Hotlap, Quick Race, Practice. I find myself racing and qualifying online exclusively and when there isn't a lobby I like with 2 or 3 others I head back and play Quick Race exclusively, sharpening my driving technique and playing around because modded tracks and cars was a huge selling point for me. For the other modes I do use: Drift needs work with the points system and Special Events is actually fun, and there are many many events to challenge you and keep you racing. Drag is pretty good too; The AI is a challenge and there is a working tree! I'd like for there to be a Drags mode online with special drag slicks. That would be something brilliant.Pros:Excellent graphics-Cars are highly detailed with full interior detail and tracks are fantastic also. Doesn't require as good a computer as most thought this is because it is a well optimised game. Medium Gaming Rig can run at 40FPS solid. You can tweak/turn off many things to gain performance.Great physics & getting better. Arguably BEST driving physics on the market.  There is however almost no external damage to the cars in Assetto Corsa. BeamNG takes the cake for crash physics(yes you should pick up that game if you're a die-hard crasher with a top PC. Shoutout to crashers: stay away from Assetto Corsa pls and if you need online crashing pickup Wreckfest, second-best crash physics with online. You won't regret it I promise.).Good selection of cars, around 40 cars come with the base game. Most the phsyics for these are solid aswell.You can tweak the usual things for a car before racing including tyre type, PSI pressure(all 4 tyres), dampers (compression, extension and fast), springs, ARB, packer rate, travel range, camber, toe, height, power & turbo power limit, brake bias, downforce, gear ratios & final, etc.FULL support of mods including modable UI, sounds, vehicles, tracks...the list goes on...Big selling point. And there are plenty of mods being pushed out by the community. I can imagine this game reaching RFactor levels of modding in 2 or 3 years.(only issue is some mods can be broken with new updates...with some creators updating their mods..others abandoning them)Great offline replay mode, with extensive photomode built-in. You can also view various telemetry data in realtime including tyre heat levels and driver inputs.Lots of customising in the options, view angle, FOV, supports VR devices, audio levels: master, engine, opponents, wind, surfaces, tyre skid, UI etc etc You can even download some theme mods that change the whole look of the menu with new icons and menu design for AC!Good FFB as of now.Supports multiple Steering Wheels with tweakingSupports Xbox360 controller, keyboards and mouse racing (None of these should be used for this sim)Great selection of tracks. Most are even Laser-scanned. No complaints in this department. Everything is STUNNING and true-to-life. Exceptions being the 5 or so fictional tracks, which are still well made. My favourite fictional is Black Cat County Long. Blast to cruise on and race.AI drivers are much improved and only getting better. They now make offline races a blast.The sounds of most cars are rich and lively but you have to use the cockpit view to get the best experience. Room for improvement.The assettocorsa.net forum is generally helpful in sorting out issues, with some users even helping you find problems when Kunos staff are busy.You can tweak your race lots: Time, AI strength (80% to 110 I think), laps, track grip, track temperature, time cycle, penalties, in addition to selecting the opponents' cars and how many of them. You can also choose your placement in the grid, and electronic aids on/off: ABS, TC, Stability control. Online servers have exclusive options to server admins: setting tyre/fuel/damage wear rate and track grip by percent as well as forcing the electronic aids on or off.Cons:Online still needs work, but it's looking good so far. It does need polishThere is no replay save button in online.Very limited, annoyingly, almost non-existent spectator mode in onlineCars pinging off others even at small contactsNot many American cars. 90% European with some Japanese(most is DLC). Not exactly a con but the only American cars we have is the Corvette C7, C7R, Shelby Cobra 427 and the new Mustang. Please add at least two more american cars for variety and competiton. A Viper, Saleen S281 SC and the sexy new Ford GT are my suggestions. Though it won't hurt to add race-spec versions of some these cars too.Criticisms:FFB still needs work but so far it's great. Few more sliders should make it top 5 in sim racing. Almost as good as LFS if you setup everything just right.Updates only adding/fixing new content rather than fixing online bugs and improving online for the players.Not allowing non-DLC players to play against DLC players. I get that you disable the DLC cars for offline but as is it's dividing the community and forcing people to play on only the newest content when they're online. The number of people racing on the base content is declining very quiclky and nearly phased out, much to my dissapointment. Some cars have very little tweaking options, whereas others have a plethora of options to setup. I get the SLS doesn't have adjustable gears, brake balance and Ride height IRL but it would be nice to just check a box and suddenly all tuning options are avaliable across all cars. Would be neat for online racing different setups. Needs built-in leaderboards for time trials, best laps, replays, ghosts and races etc.  You can download an app for this but it should be in the menus with the base game.Could do with some more server options in multiplayer. Like seamless weather transitions and ballast positioning(front to rear percent) to a car, rather than BAM 200kg to the whole car.Could do with a quick manual on how to get started with KsEditor(track importing & editing, AI and replay camera editing tool required to get a new, upcoming mod car/track working in game) and other programs, rather than throwing it out there and expecting the community to figure it all out, help each other and document everything.Would like the ability to select a different tyre compound for the front or rear tyres.

												Oh I have been searching for a simulator like this a long time.It has great Force Feedback support. So i can finally drift properly because this game has also one of the best driving models i have ever seen. It feels so good to drive Lotus 49 on Monza from '66. And try to beat that unbeatable time record. If you love driving for fun go for it. If you want awesome multiplayer experience... This is where the game is not that good. Penalty system is really bad. You just get for a bit of track and you get 5 seconds penalty. In wich you are unable to accelerate or you can drop down to 50km/h and then go on full throttle again. The race as itself in multiplayer doesn't look even like a normal race. Yes, everyone starts from grid. But the race itself is based on time. I think that on one side it's nice idea. But they should atleast give us a feature to make that normal race in wich depends your position. Because that makes your choices limited. In that case you cant just do in one lap stupidities. Then man up. Just teleport back to pits. and then go the fastest lap and simply win. I want that exciting moment in wich I fight for first place.Another problem, drivers... I mean in online. The AI are still a bit dull because they ram you same like normal players. ""Oh, gotta brake a little, this turn is sharp."" And at this moment some jackass bounces from your side to go as fast as he can and you end up in a haystack... And in the end they kick you for staying in way... So, one thing. If you are not gonna play online with your friends. I suppose don't play online. Of course I'm not saying that you shouldn't buy this game. If you are only thinking about it... Go for it! Now! You can customize cars suspension, aerodynamics. Brake bias. Engine limiter, so you can take it to insane RPM's and the engine will hate itself during shifts. Oh, I love this game. Even though i got just 20.4 hours right now. But It's mostly because I'm bored of taking my wheel on table and back to the side. I'd have like 50 hours right know. (And it's also because I play a lot of games, not just one. I'll get bored other way)+ I love to hear that the game is still being furthermore developed. The new dream pack sounds really like dream. In the trailer you can see McLaren P1, Lamborghini, but for me, there is Alfa Romeo 4C. I love that car. The flag system is finally coming, no more crashers/rammers! :D The weather/winter is coming (not sure if winter is gonna be available but I had to do that)AI are getting an updateJust get this game if you LOVE sims. Come on, it is truly awesome.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Update now that it's out of early access:-Damage now added but it's too sensitive (bumpdraft to your rear breaks your windscreen)-Pitstops are in but only in multiplayer-Still lacking any sort of flag rules-Weather and night time doesn't seem to be on the roadmap nor do the devs seem interested in doing so-Multiplayer netcode seems to have imrpoved quite a bit. -Still a fairly limited amount of cars and tracks, though lots of new content coming out and metric ton of mods available-Even though FMOD is now in, sounds are still lackluster and fairly poor-AI still dumber than a sack of rocks-FFB feels muddy compared to other simsFor a 1.0 release it feels slightly underwhelming with all the hype surrounding it. The lack of penalites/flag rules make it unsuitable for league racing. It's fantastic for pick up races and cruising however.As much as I like it, there's not much reason to choose AC over any other racing sim out there currently.-Multiplayer? iRacing-Offline racing? Game Stock Car or RaceRoom-Physics & FFB? Game Stock Car or rFactor 2-Fantastic audio, and immersion? RaceRoom-Graphics? pCars or Assetto Corsa (though I think AC wins this one)It has a lot of potential going for it and the devs seem dedicated so I would still recommend it. tl;dr CORNETTO CORSA 8/10 IT'S OKAY---EA REVIEW BELOWStill early in development and missing some features you'd see in other sims (pitstops + limiters, working headlights, damage, etc) but extremely promising. Physics are top notch and FFB feels amazing. With more content and fixes (I'M LOOKING AT YOU MULTIPLAYER NETCODE), this could be very well the much needed spiritual successor to man kinds greatest GT racer, GTR2. Oh and the modability of this game is stupidly amazing.tl;drCornetto Corsa 9/10 BRETTY GUD			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I really thought twice to buy this game, but then I watched videos reviewing this game and I decided to give it a chance. One of the best decisions I took this year. The game is awesome, so far the closer real ""feeling"" of driving I've experienced. All cars, including the slower ones, are so damn nice to drive. Even being alone in the track I can keep playing with the same car in the same road for hours. Feels better and better every lap. Great game, I'm pretty sure this game will kick♥♥♥♥♥when it comes out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If I'm being totally honest......*suspense*Assetto Corsa is an absolutely incredible racing simulator - not an arcade game, simulator.First off, the physics (if you are playing with a wheel) are just insane. While racing on the Nurburgring (or any other track for that matter), it's almost as if you can feel the suspension movement of the car through your wheel. 10/10 from me.Secondly, the graphics... oh, the graphics. They are so good. Now I may be slightly biased because I play in 4k, but my god, are they good. The reflections, the detail of the exterior and interior, the mirrors, lights, etc. are just inches away from being the same as real life. I can't even imagine how good this game is with VR. Another 10/10 from me.Thirdly, the customization. Once you load into a server, whether it is private or online, you can change everything from the tire pressure to the fuel in your tank to the camber to the ride height... there is just so much. Granted, you cannot customize your car with upgrades and ultimately personalize it, but hey, this isn't Forza guys. This game is focused on simulation, not arcade. Also allow me to mention the fact that all of the gauges inside the vehicle work, like the coolant temperature, fuel, and so on and so forth. Another 10/10 from me (in terms of realism, not arcade).Next, allow me to mention the price. 30 dollars?!?! 30 dollars?!?!?!?! You'd think Kunos is going mad for releasing such a good game for such a steal.Also, Kunos has been killin' it with the dlc. Every dlc pack is of the highest quality, and they will keep releasing content for much, much longer. I mean this game is far from being complete.The only downside about this game is the singleplayer, which could be better but I'm sure they will fix that in the future.Overall, I think Assetto Corsa is a very good simulator, and beats the pants off Project: Cars. I would certainly recommend it to anybody with a wheel who is looking for a great racing game on PC. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After almost five months of should I buy this & after spending hrs reading people coments on half  dozen forums.The problem being is it a sim or arcade  do the cars handle correctly is the sound any good & so on.Now one thing I do understand about the sim people is the age old debate on what is sim or not , its been like that from day one.So simply asking around led to the same mixed bag of  pros & cons.So in the end I decided to do my own research instead of the endless real sim debate.In the end I pick this over the like of RF2 / Race Room & I-Racing.Not that I dislike any of the others , however that said I can not agree with both I-racing & RaceRooms use of Micro sale DLC system.I also know of both sims before AC so I understand how long & how much work it as taken to get to this point from one person to todays still small team.You can feel the passion that as gone into making this Simulation & it offer a lot more in the future without need to buy a state of the hart PC to run it.People have pointed out the sounds are not that good , & for the most part I think they are wrong , I mean ok some bits need to be worked on.But that can be said of lots of little bits , however AC as kept things simple I find the menus system very good & clear , there is all the setting & tweaks to keep any hard core simmer busy , while at the same time you can just jump in & play out of the box so to speak.I did  however find a lack of manuel a bit of a oversite , but they have a very good forum where you can find most stuff out.There are also  mods & apps of all sorts that can be added to improve game play.The sim feature the now standard challenges & events along with pratice & a racing & online mode.Ok one of the biggest issue I can see is the AI its not the worst ever but not the best to & makes racing intresting if not frustrating.But like all those issues listed by others here they will be fixed or added given time.Given the scale of the jump made here by the develope by moving into a crowded market as the PC Sim racing market is & producing  very high quality sim that cn hold its own with at least three of the above.Having tested Rfactor 2  & Raceroom  they are a little different but not by much in my eyes anyhow.I lie the fact that AC's Developers have not gone for Flashy menus & stupid voice overs & kept it simply above driving.If they just keep adding Cars & improving the core & not start wasting time adding pointless flashy cut screens  & new mneus interfaces.What they have made so far I find fantastic its plays well it looks good & it runs well & even mods seem to work very well.I think the Future is looking very good for AC & its evolutions . Its was so nice to have a sim that tooks with dowloading to first drive about 1 hr very much plug and play not some thing I am use to with Sims of the past.I have not problems recomending this one to any one that enjoys having fun in cars of all types.But please understand that it is an ongoing development very much like Euro trucks 2 & a few other game out their that go along this type of constant development fase.So to those who say its no finished or this and that is missing . So what I have faith that all these things will come given time & that sometimes its better to wait & get  better overall product than some thing that says its as everything from days one & then falls way sort of the mark.For me a must haave product that will grow in a time scale that allows both the developers & the end user to get several years enjoyment from it with out braking the bank for new hardware .Very much a 9 from me & not at all over hyped as some would say.

								It is early access but at this moment Assetto Corsa is better than 90% of PC race games! Close to real car feeling, quick responsivenes of controller (I'm using xbox360 conroller), good graphics. Main lacks are: AI, damage model and multiplayer. But hey!, it's 0.4 version. If you want to test your skills, fight with yourself trying to beat best time - this early build is for you.Car handling in my opinion is better than in SHIFT2 and SimBin games (Race 07, RaceRoom). You can feel every angle of a track. Every car is different and it takes time to learn how to drive it. Also you have to learn every single track or you will spend more time on the roadside. At this moment AC shows its all pros. You just want to learn. Sit in one car on one track and drive for several hours until reach perfect lap.Xbox game pad gives much joy (I don't have race wheel) even with almost all aids off. Force feedback effect works perfectly. Also responsiveness of analog stick and sensivity of LT RT are very good.Graphics and sound depends on taste but I like them.Assetto Corsa is closer to Race 07 than SHIFT2 but I think it defeats them both.I have no comparision to Project C.A.R.S. so I can't tell which game is better. Definitely Assetto is one of the best despite of early stage.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								i regularly visit the nürburgring and hockenheimring for trackdays and played many racing games like gtr2, race 07, Gran turismo, forza, project cas... but assetto corsa is the best simulation in terms of handling and realism.If you have a wheel for the game you don´t need time to adept because it instantly feels familiar.It makes a lot of fun even if you are just trying to beat your laptime. You can clearly feel a difference between the handling of the cars.It has mod support and even it is in early access stage you can download tracks like the famous nordschleife.Drifting is a lot of fun too but i think the fly off handbrake needs an update because it is very hard to initiate the drift long ahead of a corner. The game may not have the variety of forza or GT but if you love realistic handling this simracer is the best you can get ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Second to none tire wear and track grip simulation, good selection of cars and tracks. Outstanding quality for a game made by 12 people. Server browser is in severe need of some polish but that is a lesser priority right now. Porsche license is the first one for a true racing sim in decades. Community is a good one. The modding scene is fairly large. Good things are on the horizon for Assetto Corsa, with the addition of the Porsche 919 Hybrid 2015 and 2016 LMP1 cars, as well as the Audi R18 LMP1 car, and the Toyota TS040 LMP1 car. Many different types of racing to be had, from 90's DTM to modern F1. Assetto Corsa blows the competition away, especially from a price standpoint. 9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Top of the line Racing Sim. First class development team. No tricks, gimmicks or confusing paywalls, just pure driving with the most desired exotics, racing and street class cars available. Plenty of challenge scenarios including Drag racing, hotlapping and drifting etc. Or just create your own race with the AI.PROS:- Realism / Graphics / Modding community / Brand licensing / Multiplayer / Gameplay / Controller support / VR support / Triple monitor support / Reliability / ValueCONS:- Lack of dynamic weather, but unless you want to pick apart details such as personal preferences in regards to UI or what it might not have in regards to content vs some arcade game, then I would really be hard pressed to find any cons.  In fact, Assetto Corsa is extremely optimized and runs smooth. It doesn't require a constant internet connection, subscriptions, or overpriced content. The game has been advancing since launch, always improving with every update whether it's adding textures to tracks, or improving physics, or adding quality content. Heck, they even give you free content....  Kunos Simulazioni has raised the bar.  All other sims should take notes.* Also worth mentioning is the fact that you can pretty much tailor this game to how you wish via the modding possibilities, as they are endless.10/10  I will drive the F1's, Ferrari's, Lamborghini's, Audi's, Chevy's, Ford's, Mazerati's, Porsche's, Toyota's, etc, etc, etc. AGAIN!

												This is the ultimate Racing Sim on PC right now, hands down. The physics are superb, graphics are surprisingly great, the mod support is overwhelming and the community is awesome! It doesn't matter what kind of racing you like, whether it's Formula 1, GT3, Rally, Drifting (like me) or just normal track days, AC has it all! The track selection is on the smaller side but with mods you can easily triple the amount of tracks in the game!The game has all the settings you'd ever want, support for almost every steering wheel under the sun and car setups that even beginner drivers can understand and tweak to their liking.Overall this is my favourite game of all time, I play this game almost every single day and I've never NOT enjoyed myself!10/10 from me :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Setting up a multiplayer server is a bit difficult and unintuitive, but that's about the only problem I have with Assetto Corsa. It works perfectly with my Logitech Driving Force GT. I highly recommend this game, just make sure your computer can handle it, as it is quite demanding.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a simulator, if you've played Forza 4 and want something more on PC this is the right place to come for the racing and drifting. Car clubs will be on separate forums and designing livery will we on separate software. There is little to no car upgrades and no rims to change, unless that comes in the future. But if you focus on more racing, own a Logitech g27 or better wheel, yep, you've come to the right place. Things will be a bit new and unfamiliar at first before the grip, handling and tuning menus start shining through and you immerse your self in mastering the cars.The modding community alone could make this game gigantic in the future. Gigantic in the sense that you could focus on one little area of racing and find hundreds if not thousands that enjoy the same class, tracks, time period and mode of competition. Promising is just the tip of the iceberg.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								BRAVO guys, very well done. It seems like you've struck a perfect balance between playability and realism. Physics are beautifully fluid and rewarding, unlike iRacing which seems a bit over the top with their signature death wiggle. Sound effects are amazing and comparing with iRacing AC cars sound alive. Graphics, I prefer iRacing style, AC seems somewhat sterile and artificial a bit like Grand Turismo. BTW on that note, I hope that once AC introduce multiplayer it won't turn into a console type of racing. Please make it more like iRacing where idiots have no chance of surviving.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Even though this game is still in its early stages it is completely worth getting.  The game is absolutely gorgeous.  Best looking racing game I have ever seen by far but that is coming from a consol background of every GT game and Forza game.  I can't wait to play the full game.  Pros: Most realistic driving simulator I have played.  The contorls are fluid and I just recently got a steering wheel just for playing games like this.  It is a great challenge and I have learned alot.  The steering wheel feel is heavy and feels real.  Cons:At the moment the only one that I have any problem with is the AI.  I physically cannot finish a race without an AI wrecking me most of the time in the first or second turn.  They are working on this diligently and have made some progress since I got the game.  As for getting it while its in early access, I would recomend this to everyone to get a good feel of what a racing game should feel like.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Best Sim out there...Porsche in fall.What more do you need to know?Old review:1.0.2 release version - waiting for 1.1 & Dreampack DLCAC is my first experience with a Racing Simulator.There are a few reason why this game stands out:-Modding support (already lots of cars and tracks available)-amazing road cars-Ferrari !!!-LaFerrari Kers simulated-Ruf Yellowbird-laserscanned Tracks-best graphics compared to other Sims-tire wear, flat spots, blistering simulatedCompetitors are:iRacing (lack of road cars and european cars. no tire wear, awefully expensive sub model)rfactor 2 (lack of graphics - i have not played this one)Race Room Racing Experience (lack of road cars)These are not competitors:pCars (this might very well be the best of the bunch though)Forzaand certainly not ""the crew""AC has an in depth simulation of physics, suspension, tires and aerodynamics. It is still developed on and is getting better. You can race it without a wheel but beware if you get it you will want to get a wheel because you will know how much more fun it will be.Ac is just amazing at what it does, absoloutly a must buy!Highlights of whats coming this year:-4x4 wheel drive-torque vectoring-Nordschleife laserscanned and 3 other tracks-Mclaren P1 and loads of other cars			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								There isn't really a need to type up some big long review. AC is an amazing simulation, if that's your cup of tea. Get that cup of tea and drink it. Controller user beware though. AC is 100% playable with a controller, but there is also a lot to be desired with the gamepad controls. Hoping this improves upon the release of the coming Steam Gamepad. Currently Xbox 360 Gamepad seems like your best bet.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I tried all simulators on the market except for the iRacing. Assetto Corsa is my pick without a doubt the physics/tire model/handling, graphics, and amazing content makes it best simulator on the open market. The 1.5 update show's how beautiful the game is going further and further. The only aspect which is drastic problem for the game and would change it 360 degree is online racing system, things like better flags, more realistic/playable penalties and also small staff like rolling start and let say pit-stop drive penaltie for crash, this would make Assetto Corsa online experience as close to perfectness as possible which is my dream.

												PRO'S- probably the best hotlapping simulator out there- accurate car physics and tire model- laser scanned tracks- detailed cars- accurate car sounds- moddability- amount of mods (tracks, cars & apps); some mods equal or best official content (some even get bought by the developers)- ability to set password and blacklist for your own serverCONS- racing AI; bad awareness and won't overtake each other, don't show any human behaviour (alternatives: rFactor2)- worthless career mode because of it's crappy AI- small car selection (alternatives: console racers like Forza and GT)- small track selection (solved by going to racedepartment and/or official forums and downloading all the mod tracks that interest you, installing mods is as easy as copying a folder into the tracks or cars folder)- barely any visual damage; body parts don't fly off after heavy contact- dissapointing damage model overall; sometimes small contact causes just too much damage to be believable- interface is confusing at first- lack of official servers, dedicated servers require knowledge and suitable hardware or you'd have to rent one- small development team, which reflects in the lack of communication about updates (there's no community manager) and slow improvements- no track rotation in a server without booking, online racing either requires you to rejoin the server after a restart for a different track or to join a different server- skinning (designing liveries) requires Photoshop (or equivalent), skill in that software and patience- no weatherRECOMMENDED- get a wheel to enjoy the Force Feedback (FFB) and physics at its finest- join a league or community (example: our community etcc.ridedomain.com), or dive into actively moderated servers you can find at the official forums (Marty's Aussie server/ALOOG/Minolin/etc)- download track and car mods (and apps if you need 'm)- set up your frame of view using frame of view calculators (search for them on the web)- a decent internet connection if you're planning to race online (check your ping and most of all, package loss)I'm recommending this because the pro's vastly outweigh the cons for me.

								Since this is one of the rare moments Simracing reaches the general public, let me tell a bit about the setting around the game before actually reviewing it.I consider myself a pretty serious simracer. That comes with it's perks: I have a great group of friends who share my passion. So, I had to buy this game (Peer pressure, yay!) and when I fired it up, I wasn't dissapointed.To those wh don't know: The last proper simracing game (Not counting Iracing since it's subscription based and therefore has no real release date) is from 2007 (CARS is too arcadey), which is Race 07 and costs 3 euro's on Steam.The game is easy to get used to for a simracer who knows what he's doing. In the controls menu, you'll find the regular settings, and a configuration tool to help the clueless.So far, there's no AI (The makers hope to release that in the next update partially) and no multiplayer, which leaves you to do special events, drag race, drift, practice, and hot lap around several tracks, including Monza and Imola. The tracks look lovely and feel realistic. The same goes for the cars; The cars feel real, which is exactly what simracers as myself want.I could see this becoming an E-sports game if the multiplayer is well executed, and it's great to see the attention this game has gotten.People who like features like rewinding are probably going to end up dissapointed, because this is pure simracing. 1 big mistake, and you're out. There's not a respawn option like FPS games have.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm not sure why I bought this game... maybe it was that little shinning hope that when it does come out of early access it would be a brand new amazing game. Every time I play this game I remind myself how bare bones and awful it is. I honestly don't know why the community holds this game up in such high regards.Not all is bad I mean there's plenty of things to like the number one thing being the physics model it's fun amazing and engaging. There's tonnes of graphics and user options to mess around with which is great, there's also plenty of support for controllers and wheels. There's a decent single player campaign and a fun multiplayer but that's as far as  it goes for me when it comes to the good stuff.Now the bad considering I paid around $40 back when it was in early access and it now has only like 16 tracks and about 40-50 cars... an embarrassing line up of cars at that too, not to mention half the cars are just the same damn♥♥♥♥♥♥anyways and the rest of the good stuff is behind paid DLC. The menus are clunky and more often than not you run into bugs. There is still only 3 good modes more like 2 good modes hot lap, time attack and *cough* ""shitdriftmode"" *cough* and to top it off this game doesn't even try to add Steam Workshop considering its only saving grace is ♥♥♥♥ing mods.I'm honestly shocked how people actually want this... is this what the community wants? Just a nice physics driven game with a huge lack of content? I'm honestly ashamed to even own this game, if the only thing this game has going for it is the physics than I rather look elsewhere for a game with actual content.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

So I went to the store page and found that the game wasn't in Early Access anymore.And this is the meat of my issues with this game, it's contentless. There's a miniscule number of cars, and a tiny number of tracks, and this would be ok, if the game was $30 dollars, but it's $50, almost full price, yet, there isn't enough to warrant the price.I feel jipped when I play this game, yeah, there are mods, but when a game's best feature is something someone else has done, then there is a problem.This asking price is also annoying for those of us (like myself) who have a limited budget, when I first purchased this game for $30 dollars, I felt a little ripped off, but I thought to myself, ""don't worry, they'll add more content."" Yet they haven't, and I still feel like I've been had. Despite me paying almost half then the current asking price, I still don't feel like I've got a good deal. If I'd purchased this game for $50, I'd probably be ripping my hair out currently. Yes, this game has a lot of good points, but due to the fact that there is a laughably low amount of content in this game, I simply can't recommend this game to anyone who has respect for their money. If you have money coming out of your eye balls, then go ahead, buy it, enjoy a very good simulation of driving, but if you don't, then move on, because this is simply a waste. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Could/should have a better multiplayer implementation (and I have faith that Kunos will continue improving it), but as it stands it's the greatest racing simulator ever made.  Great cars, great tracks, incredible physics and graphics.  Sounds of some cars are weak but gradually getting improved with each patch.  To be honest, driving it solo without sound would be a better experience than any other racing sim to date.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Thought this game was too hard when I first started playing it because the cars didn't seem very responsive. The only way I could get round a corner without crashing would be to take it slow, and everyone would overtake me, so I' ended up coming in last. But I realised that actually selecting Pro driver setup, as opposed to Gamer or Racer, actually made it easier. The car is more responsive. I think it's because it turns off things like traction conrol and ABS, which are designed to stablise the car and end up making it too rigid to drive fast. Just thought I'd share my experience, select Pro and this game is awesome. Love the detail and accuracy that's gone into the cars, inside and out. (Now) love the realistic handling. Love the tracks. And love the community. Looking forward to driving all the cars on all the tracks and seeing it develop over time.Update: This game deserves the ""Whoa, Dude"" award because it teleports you (with VR HMD) to a vast array of different cars recreated with precision accuracy and detail. With the right set up this has got to be the closest you will get to the real thing. The tracks are ultra-realistic as well and I'm looking forward to driving one of these cars round one of these tracks in real life to see if I can get the same, or better, lap times.

												Before you read the rest of my review please understand i would love to give this a recommendation but at the current time just dont feel i can.Since i purchased this in the early access stage i have tried repeatedly to enjoy this game, yes i believe there should be some enjoyment in playing a simulation and not just tedium. Unfortunately i cant recommend this game except to the most hardened driving simulation fans and even they will suffer at some point from the absolute perfect driving of the A I . This isnt even mentioning when the AI wish to pass you on a corner etc the answer seems to be quite simple - rear end you , this leaves you ( not them at any point i noticed ) careening onto the grass / track edge for a penalty or slow down to 50kmh ( something you would expect to find in an arcade game with catch up enabled! .Unfortunately this games just feels like an exercise in stress. I will commend the team for improving the overall driving experience since the early access but the A I simply hasnt been well adjusted. Another unusual presence in this game is the career mode choices , a time trial just for ""the fun of it"" seems to be thrown into career mode, whilst i can understand this gives you chance to practice the track before engaging in a race so does practice ( thats kind of what its there for ) .I think ultimately the developers need to understand that whilst there are many hardened sim racers out there who will thoroughly enjoy most of this experience they have ultimately sold themselves short by not creating a particularly enjoyable experience.  If you are willing to invest a lot of time of the steep difficulty curve and love racing sims then get it. If you like racing games in general this probably wont be your cup of tea.

								One and a half year since my previous reveiw, so thought I would write some more. I only drive this with a wheel and a playseat. I have tried it with an controller, but didn't manage to get a setup I was able to drive with. I have seen others be able to drive with a controller, so there is hope, even tho this game is ment to be played with a wheel.I haven't tested online since it was new, so I can't really tell you anything about the online part, except for that it was qutie buggy when it first came out (a long time ago).But just driving around famous circouts in famous cars is a lot of fun! All the cars need different techniques to get the most out of them, and you really get a sense of mastering the car, the more you drive it. I have many hours, screaming at my screen and the game, when I have done parts of the lap close to perfect, just to over reach near the end, ending up crashing.I crash a lot. All the time really. Every third lap in some cars. Which is part of the fun!Since I have pretty much been broke since Project Cars finally was release, I can't really comapre them, but even if you have Project cars, this game is a worthwhile investment!The positive:-Great sound-Great grapich-Realistic driving performance and handling-Laser scaned tracks, for optimal realism-Costs less then a single track dayThe negative:-You can't use any buttons on the G27 to navigate the menues. This means I have to get up everytime I need to do a pitstop, and can ruin AI play as well.-The AI is a bit clucky (or was at least, might have become better)-Career mode isn't all that great. It isn't like Forza or other games where you work your way up. THere are just different modes you need to complete to get to the next tier.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Incredible !! I just can't wait for Oculus Rift to pair it with this simulation software ( sorry but i can't call it a game :)The only milestones for Assetto Corsa now is the multiplayer and AI, i really hope they will nail these parts too.AWESOMEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!

								Assetto Corsa is showing great potential.  Especially if you have a 3 monitor set up.  This game has by far the best set up options for 3 monitors that I have ever seen.  Want to adjust your FOV, there is a tool for that,  Want to have the game actually take into consideration the angle of your monitors in relation to each other,  It gives you complete control.  Driver head position, no problem.The real kicker.  You can make all these adjustments in game. Just mouse over the right side hidden menu and up pops a ton of on the fly adjustments.

								THIS GAME IS A BIG DEAL!I noticed ""Assetto Corsa"" today as it's a special offer for this weekend.What shall I say: I'm absolutely embaraced about what is provided. Although the game is ""pre release"" it's astonishing what you get when buying this game.Talking about me and my expectations: I love driving bikes and cars real world. I also like this ""simulated"". Over the last 15 years (or so) I recognised that there is no ""Moped-"" (==motobike-) simulation which will work for me. Driving cars in our days is simulated in an acceptable manner.""In real world"" I love driving lightweight cars.Driving @home I use a Playseat and a Steering Wheel. (Logitech G27 on PC, the old Logitech Wheel on the XBox 360)What I want: I don't want to race (online/offline) I want TRACKDAY-driving.My main problem is (was?) that the physics is some kind of morbid running the most existing PC Simulations. As I tried a lot my favorite at the moment is Forza 5 on XBox 360. Using PC simulations like ""Race Room"" my major issue is that these Programs to me do not feel like ""driving a real car""! The behavior of my wheel (Logitech G27) is crap, especially when the car oversteers. - Forza 5 does this much more than all other (PC- or PS-) games I tried before. The problem playing this is (mainly) that the Wheel (Logitech Drive Fx) is crap...Playing Assetto Corsa for about 1/2 an hour to me was a really great experiance! The Lotus Elise on track behaves like a Lotus Elise driven on Track... ;->SO now my whishes for the further development:- please(!!!) add the ""Nürburgring Nordschleife""- add any other tracks- enhance the physics- enhance the FF (Forced Feedback) for the Logitech G27The FF of the G27 is my only (little) issue. Hitting the curb is somehow a little ""lazy-implementet"". I'm sure this will be fixed... ;-)Looking from my point of view any kind of KI or Races or what else doesn't matter...OVERALL: THANX to the developers for this wonderful simulation!P.S.: Preferred Tracks to be added:- Hockenheim (all Tracks)- Infineon Raceway- Suzuka- AND: of course the ""Nürburgring Nordschleife""... ;-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Assetto Corsa is one of the best Racing Simulation Games out there.I bought it in sale for 50% of the price and I can tell it is remarkably authentic and realistic, considering that you do not really sit in front of the rim of an M3 GT2. I purchased it to function with my Logitech G27, which by the way works perfectly fine since it comes with full Racing Wheel-Support.Thumbs up!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Where to start. 350+ hours into this game. Not a moment of boredem. Bought this game earlier in the year. Started to get into it mainly for the drifting side of things. Got about 10 hours in using my xbox microsoft controller. In which i decided to purchase a Logitech G27. Best decision ever. At current i play the game daily. Gonna chuck pros and cons below to my opinion and of me using a wheel.Pro's- Large amount of mods and easy to installGraphics are good and game runs smooth on my Custom budget PC (3 years old now)Standard cars/tracks give enough to keep you entertainedPhysics are not 100% realistic. But very easy to pick up.Con's - Would be nice for the game to detect between H shifter and paddles so you didnt have to change everytime in the menus The cockpit view could do with a slight motion blur to give a concept of speed. go flying into some corners way to fast if you arent concerntrating. As the game is used a lot by people wanting to drift. A points system would be nice.Aside that. I couldnt recommend anyone enough to buy this game. If you have a wheel or your budget means you can buy one. Then do it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												THE WHEELHOP IS REAL!!!!I'm using the Fanatec Porsche 911 GT3 RS V2 Wheel, and let me tell you. I hopped in the Fiat 500, revved up to 6k rpm and let out the clutch and it was real life. Instant uncontrollable shutter from the steering wheel until i managed to find traction when i let out the accelerator. I paused the game and group texted my friends, ""You guys need to come over and try this!"" The realism in this game is outstanding. Ive owned an SRT-4 neon, Subaru Legacy GT Spec.b, and a LS2 6 speed GTO. All VERY different cars. Every car in this game feels insanely different, and they've captured the very essence of pure racing around the track trying various cars. If you are into cars in general, and have a racing wheel, YOU NEED THIS GAME!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								As an inexperienced newcomer to sim-racing, there is not much that can compare to a pulling off an unassisted balls to the wall lap of Imola in a Ferrari F40 without going off-track. In games like GRID or Forza, excitement comes from winning races and the drive to keep playing derives from the carrot on a stick that is the credits you need to earn to buy more cars.AC doesn't even have a carrot on a stick for winning races yet (career mode is not yet done), and I still regularly start it up just to do hotlapping sessions of various car/track combinations. The driving is just that much fun in and of itself, and incredibly challening at that.Online racing is also remarkably fun to do, and once you escape inevitable turn 1 malarky, most racers will happily battle you for position turn after turn with courtesy and giving you your space while you give them theirs. It seems most people enjoy a having great and tense battle more than winning it, and that allows for them to take place cleanly. Most people rather see their opponent win it and have another chance to be a hero in the next few turns, than risk hitting them and ending up in the gravel together.There are a few glaring omissions such as pit stops and better ways of getting in a public race (the booking system makes sense, but it could use some more options to allow e.g. joining in practice mode),  but even if they stop development entirely I feel as though I've gotten more than my money's worth already. And so far, they've done the contrary and maintained a fairly strong update/patch schedule every other Friday.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So now I have 600+ hours in this game I think I have put in more than enough hours to review this game in a fair light, kunos games calls assetto corsa (your racing simulator) and they aren’t wrong there, This is the best racing sim I have ever owned the gameplay is solid the feel of the cars and the FFB on the wheel is amazing.Now I am a BIG drifting head to be honest most of the hours I have put in the game have been me drifting in the DriftJunkie servers =D so if you want this game for drifting I 1000% think you should get this game. And maybe we can tandem someday, The graphic are nice & sharp in all the right places for a sim… sure the graphics aren’t forza standard but then again we don’t own this game for the graphics we own it for the realism it brings to the table.Let’s talk content as this is one place where kunos skimped out, assetto corsa has a small number of cars & tracks and even the career is small when you look at most other racing games. There are no leader-boards which feel is a MUST on any racing game. It’s almost like kunos sat down one day at a board meeting and said let’s forget about content we will just let the community build the game for us & they have. All you are is a couple of clicks away for endless tracks, cars & apps, even the community has made its own leader-boards (RSR LiveTiming) in my mind this is the only con this game has. But the endless pros far out way this one con.Overall I give this game a SOLID 9.5/10 (FULLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Very very nice game, i am comparing this to forza 4, the graphics are fantastic the level of detail is superb. The driving simulation makes forza feel like an arcade game. And for this reason it doesd take a while getting used to, and playing with the settings. The extent of tuning that you can do to the car is spectacular, form tires and cabmer to amount of fuel and aerodynamics tuning. I really recomend you get this game, if you like racing games, there are not many good ones on pc, but this is the best of what ive seen.Only problem i can see, is that the traction control need altering, but understanably this is an alpha, so imsure this will be worked on. But i tend not to use assists, only using it untill i get used to the game, having been used to forza.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								More than a game, a simulator. Assetto Corsa is still in alpha/beta and it's already setting standards in the racing fanatics' community. Having a wheel with this game is a must, as is having a screen as large as possible if a correct and accurate FOV is desired. A triple monitor setup is highly recommended.The physics are absolutely amazing; they set the bar for other racing games for sure.Cons so far: relatively few tracks, but more are in the way. Please add classic tracks like Laguna Seca, Eastern Creek, and Nurburgring Long, Kunos!Also, the car roster needs to be expanded. But Kunos is hard at work licensing more cars, as far as I'm aware.Finally, a ""con"" for many people would be the very fact that this is a simulator. It is very unforgiving to arcade racing ""technique,"" like flooring the gas pedal during curves or overshooting curves. That is, of course, if your pride makes you turn off the in-game assists, since this game is really easy for casual/newbies if you turn on assists.Thanks for reading, and yes, I highly recommend this game to racing fans.

								I feel compelled to write this having just attempted to play GRID...Assetto Corsa is the next best thing to actually owning a Ferrari 458, BMW Z4 GT3 or a Lotus Exos. Now, I haven't actually driven any of the cars included in the game in reality, but the fact is the feel right. I play this with a Logitech Driving Force GT and I used a simple gamepad before that, and even then it felt like driving, plain and simple.The handling, sounds and feel of the game are fantastic. You can really feel the difference with the laser scanned tracks and every little bump is noticable. Cars behave and sound like cars, and the interiors are gorgeously detailed. There are a few issues with it at the moment since it's currently in beta (I had my car once do a forward flip after I braked heavily and the nose went into the road) but things are improved every patch.I can't say enough good things about this. It's a true driving simulator and it's hours and hours of fun, though I would strongly reccomend using a wheel with this.Note: If you're after a ""game"" this probably won't enjoy you. Try the aforementioned GRID or Need for Speed or something.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												i still remember the first day i bought assetto corsa, it was a tough times sincei'm really struggling to drive in this game, either the car is understeer or oversteerbut after i look up on some guide and tips, i finally can enjoy driving in this game.it takes a while since i'm using a controller to get used to it,while also i learned how to tune cars. i almost regret buying this game but,that feeling change as i play through the gamePros:+Awesome physics+Variety of car,track and app mods+Great Optimization+Beautiful engine sound (especially mazda rx7 engine)+Simple Graphics Cons:-Online experience is not good enough-Menu Interface kinda look boring-Not a lot of cars to choose (can be fixed with mods)i also heard a lot of people said that this game is unplayable with a controllerand you have to get a wheel set up, howeveri wouldn't say its unplayable,i would say if you wanted to enhanced your experiencein this game , buy a wheel setup and it is playable with a controller, its just you haveto get used to it, if you are willing to give time to practice with a controlleri'm really sure you can do it, if you still didnt trust me you can see the video below of me driving in NÜRBURGRING with a controller (i know i'm not the best driverbut just to give you some proof)


YouTube™ Video: Assetto Corsa-RedBull x2010 @NÜRBURGRING Track Mod (hotlap) 

			Views: 177		

			Video of me doing a hotlap in Nurburgring, it was fun and challenging at the same time. still need to improve the time though, sorry if my driving skill is not good enough time: 5:11:64 Assist: all...		

Conclusion: i really recommend it you to buy this game if you really wanted to learnabout cars and willing to give sometime especiallly the ones with controller, its not easy but it is possible. if you dont, i think you will be bored in a shortperiod of time, as for those people that have steering wheel, i highly recommended itto you. i'm still in 100+ hours, planning to keep continue playing this game andhad a plan buying a wheel setup one day.

												Assetto Corsa is by far the best driving simulator I've ever played, and as far as I can tell, is _the_ killer app for VR. I can't entirely explain why, but driving in this game is an exhilarating, gratifying, relaxing, wonderful immersive experience. Pair it with good hardware, and you won't regret this purchase at all. Caveat: Oculus support is still marked as beta, and it _has_ frozen up on me a couple times, so it's not perfect (yet).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Being a fan of racing sims and having years of real driving experience, I've always been looking for a game that allows me to feel the car and the road as close to genuine driving as possible. Assetto Corsa absolutely delivers the real thrill of being behind the wheel of a car. There aren't so many vehicles and tracks to choose from yet, but the ones that are available at the moment - are recreated with maximum detail and with true passion. And more downloadable content is on the way! As to the physics, only iRacing can compete with this game in my opinion - the driving is simply phenomenal. The fact that the development team uses real performance data from car manufacturers puts the experience to a higher level, you can easily lose yourself in this simulation for hours straight. And the graphics are gorgeous, especially if you have pc-horsepower to crank up all the video settings. Cockpit cam is superb, the quality of the interiors is second to none. I recommend playing it in 3D with a good FFB wheel. In a word, this is a must have for all racing fans. And if you are not a racing fan - play Assetto Corsa and you will undoubtedly become one ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Also has proper triple monitor support at any angle / distance you like with the in game calibration app.  Not as pretty lighting / reflections and effects as Project Cars, but it feels and drives more real to me, which I think is most important.

												This is a game, like many, constantly encouraging me to get a computer upgrade (This game is the only one where I've gotten zero frames without the game crashing). But, to be honest if you have the specs, BUY THIS GAME! It's amazing, and as a racer I know exceptionally well about realism. This may be the most realistic racing game ever made. There's always those driving sims that claim they're the best, but none will ever beat this. The graphics and gameplay are amazing too. Bottom line, BUT THIS GAME!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game is so realistic and so satisfying that achieving your first clean flying lap will be a fist-pumping accomplishment. It's so good that it convinced me to buy a full wheel/pedal/shifter controller set, *for this game alone*.The track selection, despite being somewhat limited in early-release, lets you get a real taste of different racing styles. Classic 60's Monza, for white-knuckle high-speed straightaways. Tight, technical Magione will feel familiar to autocrossers. The drift circuit, for all the drift pigs to play on. And the sweeping curves and elevation changes at Vallelunga for the sheer joy of motoring.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Assetto Corsa attempts to strike a balance between simulation and casual racer. The team at Kunos Simulazioni have a passion for all things automotive, and it shows with AC's eclectic mix of road vehicles, lightweight sports cars, open wheelers and full on track machines.This is a beta release, so much of the content and features are still to come. But the cars, tracks and challenges available at this point in the development of Assetto Corsa should keep armchair racers happy for a while. The game feels like a gentleman's racer, a laid back title with a subtlety not usually associated with a racing sim. Think Chris Harris rather than Clarkson. When you start the game, no one is shouting at you to drive this and race that with a soundtrack pounding you steadily into submission. You choose what you want to drive, where to race and whom to race against. Menu design is intuitive and is easily navigable. It's a welcome return to when interfaces had function to them with icons and text used to great effect.Pick your car. Choose your track. Go Race. The fun is learning the nuances of each vehicle and trying to exploit them trackside. The Ferrari 599XX EVO is a vastly different beast from the Abarth 500 EsseEsse for example, but each offer their own challenges and provide their own rewards. Take your time to appreciate each car in its own right and you'll begin to enjoy racing for fun again. Driving a lightweight Lotus around a tight, twisting track is as much fun as fun as piloting a GT3 racer around Monza, possibly more so.To get the most out of this title, you will need a wheel but the game supports other inputs and is easily playable using a 360 controller. I use a battle worn and rather creaky logitech G25 and the default force feedback settings work really well, with only some minor adjustment made to the gain. You can of course make many adjustments to your chosen method of control, but I was happy with the out of the box settings.Cars are a joy to drive. I always feel in control and that I can correct any minor mistakes without the rear swapping ends, but I know if I push too hard I'll be barrier bound. AC never let's you feel complacent, it just challenges you to drive as fast as you think you can and lets you feel fantastic when you hook up that record lap. The recently introduced AI is decent but not perfect, especially in large fields. Every update brings improvements and thankfully the days of backflipping BMWs and pirouetting Paganis are thankfully now gone. Small fields of cars with similar performance on appropriate tracks will bring the greatest challenge, with more believable behaviour from your computer opponents. Those wanting multiplayer will have to wait a bit longer for that update though.If you wish for a grown up racer then Assetto Corsa may just be for you, but remember that it's effectively a work in progress and many features are not available at this point. But what there is is at the time of this review is a great indication of what is to come when Assetto Corsa goes final.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								good road feedback, excellent force feedback support, awesomely detailed cars and tracks.Can't wait for more tracks and some AI thrown into the mix;for now it's a driving simulator with very high standards!------------------update: AI has been added, more cars and tracks; excellent sim, was well worth the early purchase, we're not at release candidate status, meaning it's just bugfixing now.they added DK2 support (Oculus) which makes this the best racing sim on the planet (for now?), immersion is top notch, the details on the cars is insane, you can walk around the car, explore the cockpit and you really have the impression you are there!Even with the modest resolution of the DK2 (1920x1080) seeing the road and apex of the corners is very much doable, although a step up in resolution would really make this a killer software title for the Oculus Rift.can't wait for the official nurburgring nordschleife to be added, for now I'm using a converted track and just copied into the AC tracks folder, works wonders and very enjoyable!the AI can be tweaked with a simple 0-100% slider, they are clean racers and overall offer a good challenge for slower pilots like me, I'm pretty sure seasoned race veterans will leave the AI in the dust, but they offer enough challenge... much better than the AI in GT5 and Forza :)best sim/racer out on the PC? Yes sir!------------Update May 2015. Assetto Corsa is now past 1.0 release and it's still going strong; Career option has been added, giving it a good single player experience, although I still miss the ""garage"" of GT5 where miles are tracked and cars need maintenance (even minimal is fine) for top performance. Further more the Nurburgring is now completely inside the game, 20+km of glorious roads, although this update (and some nice extra cars) costs extra (DLC), worth the money? if you're invested in the game: sure; A must buy to enjoy AC? Not really.VR integration hasn't changed since release, still the same menu troubles and absent UI elements; a few hotkeys can be mapped to restart race, reset car. and since latest patch you need to tweak .ini files to get exposure working correctly (otherwise it's too bright); with DK2 using SweetFX to increase sharpness does a lot to get better immersion. Overall in combination with Virtual Deskop, AC with DK2 is very much playable			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is incredible! The bmw is a blast to drive, the ai is a tad bullish but nothing like (shift or project cars) they actually have a bit of survival instinct. The feel of each car is of its own and the gas pedal does bite on the high enders. But can be brought back into control under some light feathering. Finally something besides iracing that doesn't feel like plain ol line between slip and grip sims. you can go from slip back to grip with some refined pedal and wheel work! Just feels great! worth every penny. One early access you know will give back versus some developers that get their money and done. anticipated 10/10 if the community is their to support the multiplayer side of the game.

								Assetto Corsa is one of those games that make you stand back and marvel at its brilliance. Well, it is almost there at least. I have wanted to get into sim racers for some time and when I saw this on the Steam Store I brought it. The selection of cars in the game is a good as there are several types of vehicles to choose from, these include open wheel, street and track cars. There is a small selection of tracks with some tracks just be variations but each track suits different cars. You can play this game with a Xbox 360 controller but to get that immersive feeling like you are in the car and driving it you would have to invest in a wheel and pedals. The graphics are actually very good, they could do with a polish but they are great for now. A few little tweaks with the car sounds can make it feel a bit more realistic.As for the current state of the game it is absolutly brilliant. Hopefully AI will be introduced soon and it can make the game one of the best racing games I have played (to be honest, it already is). This is a must for any boy (or girl) racer out there that wants a solid sim racer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As far as PC gaming gets, I've yet to encounter anything that commands my focus and pulls me in as much as this game. The visuals are just stunning, the physics are spot-on, the controller support is just fantastic... I sometimes have to remind myself it's just a game. Singleplayer is very open for mods, so there's no chance it'll ever get boring (Reliant Robin on a Mario Kart track, etc..) Multiplayer is great, but you'll need quick reflexes to avoid aggressive or inexperienced drivers, as they're pretty common. This game is not as much for people who like casual driving games, and I highly doubt this game would be playable without a proper racing wheel. So if you love hardcore simulation, this is your game. My only realy gripes are the often-lackluster AI (losing control in drag races, getting stuck on walls) and shaky connections online, but those are just minor. tl;dr great driving game, very realistic.

												As far as PC gaming gets, I've yet to encounter anything that commands my focus and pulls me in as much as this game. The visuals are just stunning, the physics are spot-on, the controller support is just fantastic... I sometimes have to remind myself it's just a game. Singleplayer is very open for mods, so there's no chance it'll ever get boring (Reliant Robin on a Mario Kart track, etc..) Multiplayer is great, but you'll need quick reflexes to avoid aggressive or inexperienced drivers, as they're pretty common. This game is not as much for people who like casual driving games, and I highly doubt this game would be playable without a proper racing wheel. So if you love hardcore simulation, this is your game. My only realy gripes are the often-lackluster AI (losing control in drag races, getting stuck on walls) and shaky connections online, but those are just minor. tl;dr great driving game, very realistic.

												So that i don't write a wall of text I will just point you to video that was made by Assetto Corsa devs. And it is explaining what you get in the game.


YouTube™ Video: Assetto Corsa - Built For Racers Trailer 

			Views: 29,332		

			Built by racing enthusiasts, for racing enthusiasts... Assetto Corsa will be released on August 26th (EU) and August 30th (NA) on PlayStation® 4 & Xbox One. Pre-order NOW!		

But if you want my opinion. I can only say its realistic physics,laser scanned tracks,every car is different handling. And All in all enjoyable feeling.I was driving Lamborghini,and when I got used to it I was like I will go drive Ferrari and loaded up in Ferrari first corner i was off the track :D then I saw you really need to learn each car and master your skills.When you play multiplayer opponents are respectful they are some who still don't know how to drive and they are ramming etc. but it is a game just try to win :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is, by a large margin, the best simulation I've had so far. Everything is realistic to a point where cars feel exactly as in real life. Drifting the 458 is just as difficult and with the same feeling as the real thing (I'm an automotive engineer).The preview is pretty much a full game. I completely recommend this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Assetto Corsa does a lot of things brilliantly, but does fall short in a couple of aspects:Beautiful & Laser scanned tracks 10/10. Track atmosphere should feel more alive i.e. added crowds, cheering etc on race day.Accurately detailed cars 9/10. Sounds 7/10.Visuals 9/10. Good content and vast selection of both cars (street & race) and tracks 8/10. Ever expanding with well priced & free DLC's.Good FFP, physics & simulation aspect 7/10. Still missing some key elements such as simulated pits, car systems such as brake temps etc.AI still needs improvement, and the team is always fine tuning & updating their behaviour 6/10.Massive modding community, and lots of quality content to be had 8/10.Over all, and as a package, this is one of the most complete Sims on the market and it will consistently reward you for your driving efforts. If you are racing fan, and have a racing wheel, Assetto Corsa is a must.9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is a game I was waiting for a long time and its finally out and better than I hoped. If you are looking for a lifelike handling car sim with up to date graphics and have a fairly up to date and powerful PC. This will blow your mind if you have reached that point where arcade-like games just aren't fulfiling.I recommend that you buy yourself a racing wheel to enjoy this game properly. It is very easy to drive with an XBOX360 controller asuming you have the right settings first.I would rate this game in the following aspects:Current Content  26/11/2013   : 4/10Full Release Content                 : 8/10/Future use (mods)                    : 8/10Graphics                                   : 8+/10Handling                                   : 9+/10My hardware :CPU : Intel ivy-bridge i5 3570K@3.4GHzRAM: 8GB DDR3GPU: nVidia GTX 660 Ti - Driver : 331.82Rez : Full HD 1080p@60HzOS  : MS Windows 7 Ultimate 64 Bit""My racing simulator""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm more a rally person. Ok I've grinded Gran Turismos on Playstations.. But on PC and sim racing, rally has been my no.1, thanks to Richard Burns Rally.Now I see myself enjoying more and more of driving on tarmac tracks. Driving Assetto Corsa. I've tried iRacing and pCARS etc. iRacing was good but I don't like monthly subscription system.. I guess it is worth it, but still, my gaming is seasonal. Back to AC. One reason for it is Ferrari F40. 90% of my playtime so far is trying to handle that beast. Really handle. Not to drive like my grandma. No more comments on that atm :DPS. This review is for players with decent wheel controller. I'm going to buy pedals with clutch soon.. Thanks F40 & AC.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game is okay - controls and response from my controller seem sluggish and delayed, which makes it hard to play. My biggest complaint? The fact they just released a $15 DLC pack, and the main game itself has such a tiny collection of cars. on top of that, there is no menu music, the buttons don't clearly state what they are so you're kind of left guessing in some parts, and the controller support only works during a race and not for any of the menus! Why would I want to put my controller down and grab my mouse/keyboard for navigating the menu? In conclusion - game has a lot of potential, but come on AC team. Get your prirorities straight, and deliver us a good complete game before you go fishing for more DLC money...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love driving in this game. The physics are difficult but once you get over the learning curve it's very rewarding. The graphics are outstanding, as is the sound. But that's all this game has going for it.The career mode could not be more dull. It's a very simple, linear game. And since there are hardly any cars or tracks it gets repetitive. There is nothing to work for. No currency to buy cars, no ""tournaments"" that you can only enter by meeting certain qualifications, no licences. I'm not even sure why they call it a career mode. The experience of being a carrer racing driver is not there.Coming from console gaming, and in particular playing the Gran Turismo series, this game is a huge letdown. I am hoping somebody comes out with a decent sim eventually because there's not much to offer on PC right now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly i had so much hope for this Sim... the Problem is that its nothing more than a hot lap sim .... the Career mode sucks, no pit stops, no quali, the damage model is a joke, no night racing, no endurance (nothing more than 30 lap race), NO WEATHER and news that the game is going to be ported to console. The game isn't even ready on PC let alone porting it over to a console. Get a grip Such a shame because as i say it has got a lot of hope going for it. Why on earth they made DLC is madness in my eyes. Also there hasn't been a patch since April.... we are in July now. I pray to god they get there act together. At least the game isn't as bad as Project Cars. Its nowhere near as good as ISI or Reiza Studio games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Il explain my experience here. And a few absolutes. After switching on most games you get to play them However that was not thecase with  AC. I havent managed to play it yet. The General User Interface (GUI) is in one word... Diabolical. It is set up like a website and not very clear what you have to actually do to get it to work. I set the screen at 800x600 because that is the only way I could get it to display the whole thing. (its usually 1280x900/720).Then when I get on the actual track its not clear how to get the car to actually move... Then when it eventually does move, its undrivable with massivve oversteer (not very realistic at all). But if that was the only problem I wouldnt have commented here. I would have sorted it but to be frank this game will never get played. The whole experience of it is as mentioned Diabolical. I like to pick up my controller and press the buttons and play. This requires constant use of a mouse which to me makes it unplayable. If I could get my money back I would. Its terrible. And will never play it.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The best Racing Sim/Hard+software engineer RPG ever made.Want to race beautifully rendered high powered cars around outstanding laser scanned tracks from around the world? Hells yeah! Want a really excellent car set-up ability that really feels like it makes a difference? This game really does have all that in spades. Okay the career is a bit boring, but online racing is good. The cars really handle very differently to each other and the laser scanned Nurburging Nordschleife is an absolute joy to drive.Then a couple of times a year a patch comes along +/- DLC. This is where the game suddenly becomes RPG. You've proved your metal on the track, you've fine tuned those racing machines to your perfection...now have you got what it takes to do the same to your PC and the software? Before you can get back out on to the track you must cut your way through another field of hopefuls, all floundering in the sand trap cos the FPS drop sent them there, desperately trying to find the fix to get them out of the techno babble hell they've been sent to. My fellow hopeful asked a simple question on a forum (the guy had about as much knowledge as me...not a lot) and got this reply....'26% total core load, yes but what are your individual core loads? You might have one core being hammered to the point that it affects the proceeding cores causing a bottleneck.' FANTASTIC! Possibly the worst good point I ever saw on a gaming forum. I've been stuck in this RPG phase of the game over a week. Sure I've learnt some stuff about hardware and software, but really I just want to drive a racing car in a video game. I don't want to be going into game files and changing numbers or spending 20hrs in forums after every patch.If I was to score out of ten, 5 for the drive sim, 0 for the RPG. 5/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do you enjoy Forza? Looking for something similar, but that you can play on PC? Hoping to use an Xbox 360 controller or something similar because you don't have $300-$1000 of disposable income to buy on a racing wheel? Look elsewhere. I bought this because I have played all kinds of racing games over the years, but hadn't really found a good PC racing game. This looked like the answer, but after a little over a half an hour of skidding into walls while trying frantically to saw at the wheel in a vain attempt to regain control of my vehicle, I realized that this is not the game for me.Realistically, in the ""Requirements"" section, a racing wheel should be listed. If you're going to say that you support the Xbox 360 controller, then I shouldn't have to futz with the settings just to finally get it to a point where the most minute of movements doesn't have the driver spinning the wheel frantically from side to side. Honestly, this problem has been SOLVED. Turn 10 obviously is aiming almost exclusively for the 360 controller, but these developers basically just shoved in some nonsensical presets and called it a day. It appears to respond as it would to the analog input of a wheel, which is ridiculous. A wheel has wildly different affordances than a 360 controller, yet the default presets make the game unplayable with said controller.Not to mention the fact that the game crashed multiple times on me in various settings menus. I'm very disappointed with Assetto Corsa. As a racing fan, I was hoping that this would be the answer for my craving for a solid racing game to replace Forza. What I received was a buggy game that only appears to be enjoyable if you've got a racing wheel. Which is fine, but I wish I had known that *before* I dropped $60 on the game. Now, because there is no refund policy for games that you instantly regret buying, I get to look at this game resentfully in my library every time I open Steam.If you've got a pro racing setup already in your home and you're a racing sim veteran, then this review really isn't for you. However, if you, like I was previously, are looking for something to fill a Forza-sized hole in your PC library, look elsewhere.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Only game physics that compare to this is live for speed and this is better and it  looks stunning. Cant recomend it enough. Cant wait till the AI and multipayer come.

								I've been playing console racers and sims my entire life and always stayed away from PC sims. I loved Gran Turismo and never experienced anything that would tear me away from it. This, however, made me fall in love with cars and simulators all over again.The cars look jaw-droppingly beautiful and handle like a dream. It takes some time getting into if you're coming from console sims, but it's worth the effort. I use an XB360 controller and after getting the settings right it handles great.Assetto Corsa is the finest simulator I've ever played			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								If iRacing and rFactor had a baby this would be the outcome, the AI is still a bit dodgy and sometimes doesn't acknowledge you're right there with them but they keep improving it and can't go anywhere but up. The feeling of the sim is pretty much right on point (using G27 wheel) being smooth and not overdriving is key or you'll end up scrubbing speed and losing time, once you get the feeling and get accustomed you'll start to see the rewards this sim will give you for respecting it. This is no arcade type sim, so don't buy this if you plan on driving it like you would on forza or need for speed.  Can't wait to see what they come up with once it's fully released with online, this will give iRacing a run for its money especially when Nurburgring Nordschleife is on this service.

								My computer is under the minimun requirements (AMD Athlon II X2 255, 4Gb RAM and an Asus HD 5450 1Gb) and I've got a 90º wheel from Trust.After getting and testing the non-steam version of the 0.2 pre release and seeing that I can run the game at playable FPS (~30 @1280x720) I couln'd wait to play the 0.3 version. The release day for the 0.3 passed and I was checking so many times a day to see if there was a non-steam version of the 0.3 alvailable.After 3 or 4 days I couldn't wait anymore and bought the game on steam. 11/10 would buy again. My next move is going to be a Driving Force GT.Can't wait for what is to come - AI, Multiplayer, Asian and American Cars and new tracks. Keep it up Kunos!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hands down my favourite racing sim on the market. The only bad thing I can think of about this game is that the sounds are not up there with the likes of Raceroom Racing Experience. But then again not a lot is. The physics are really good imo however some people do not seem to think so. Also the FFB is really nice and gives you a good sense of how the car behaves and where the limit is. It is a highly moddable game with hundreds of mods already available from early access. I would highly reccomend this game to any with a keen eye on racing. You do not have to have a racing wheel to play this game but I would strongly suggest you invest as it is a comepletely different experince and one that is worth the money that it costs. So overall, go purchase this game right now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm starting to love this game, though you need to put some work into it (both in terms of driving and setup). Here is a 4 step guide to get you started:1. Run the LUT Generator to (vastly) improve force feedback and then check for clipping.2. Set pre-rendered frames to 1 in nvidia's profile inspector to get rid of the steering lag (if you have any). Tweak some settings while you're there.3. Install Bridgehampton and Caterham Academy.4. Lean back and enjoy. Wait, I mean, DRIVE DRIVE DRIVE!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Only game physics that compare to this is live for speed and this is better and it  looks stunning. Cant recomend it enough. Cant wait till the AI and multipayer come.

								I read the review from Gamer Muscle and it made me laugh and because of the detail of the review tempted me to purchase it. So I bought it and I am not disappointed at all. It's a brilliant game especially concidering the fact it's in BETA mode. There are only a few cars available and there are also only a few tracks, but it's still good fun. To play it I have a Thrustmaster Ferrari Edition Racing wheel which is not listed in the pre-configurations, but that's okay! You can easily configure the controls easily. It took me about 1 minute to set it up correctly. I did have to invert the throttle and brakes because they were the wrong way around but that's also fine.The gearbox is impossible to change to manual. I want manual and you cannot change it; although you are allowed to interfere with the gearbox in-game and change up/down at will, but if the game detects it's too early then it changes back to what it thinks it should be. Hopefully this will be fixed at some point...Another problem I have found when using my racing wheel is that the steering is really poor. I turn about 2 degrees and the wheels lock up and I jjust spear straight off. This is with all of the cars I use and it's really annoying because it's ruining the game for me. I have tried adjusting the sensetivity of the steering but so far, no luck... If anyone can help me with this then that's great, I'll test it out and let you know. Otherwise I would like to see it fixed. The game for me is set of maximum settings and it runs perfectly... Very well optimised. This is my setup and it works great on maximum everything.CPU: Intel Core i5 3570KGPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 680RAM: 8GB Corsairetc.The game overall is extremely good and I can't wait for the finished product! Despite the fact it's in BETA mode and it will have regular updates I fully 100% recommend this game to everyone! It's brilliant and in the short time that I have played I haven't found any bugs whilst in the game... Just a few setup issues as mentioned before.If you're looking at my recorded play time and thinking ""why should I listen, you've barely played it!""; well, if I'm writing a review without having even played an hour and I'm extremely impressed with it then you can imagine that I'll be playing a lot more in my spare time!EDIT: Since the review I have found how to adjust the gearbox to manual! It was right in front of me all the time in the realism settings! I have also adjusted the steering sensetivity and deadzones etc. for ages and it's still awful. And no, I'm not trying to enter a corner at 500 MPH. I'm doing it at a range between 60 MPH (100 KPH) down to ~37 MPH (60 KPH) and at both speeds, it's awful!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Assetto Corsa is a game for sim racing and fun racing enthusiasts alike. While a representative of neither niche is going to be fully content with the state the game is currently in, the developers work hard on giving the player the best possible physical behaviour of the cars they implement. So far, they have acquired licenses for various brands of makers of road, sports and race cars, a more sophisticated ruleset for races and management tools for server administrators are still somewhat lackluster, but in the works. What this game can definitely deliver: Beautiful graphics, realistic physics, and an absolutely awesome modding community which helps to make the game feel more complete. The developers take kindly to creative approach and sometimes even include the work of the community in their game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I would highly reccomend this game. It has been a suitable replacement for rFactor and iRacing.  The car list is a little short at the moment, but don't let that turn you down, because the few cars in here a very good cars.  The sounds are great, the driving dynamics are great as well, and the customizable UI is revolutionary, becuase you can have it set to exactly how you want it. The only thing I can think of that it needs is so more street cars instead of having it be all race cars, and the skid force on force feedback could also be worked on. Overall, well worth the $40 dollars instead of paying monthly afor iRacing and having to pay for individual cars and tracks.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great sim with a deep understanding of the underlying physics that effect handling and weight transfer of anything with four wheels.

								Been playing this game whenever I have time, I bought this little 10 dollar mini foldable controller and have been playing this game for weeks now. I originally bought it earlier this year but had forgotten about it(lol), I would recommend this game to anyone who is into car physics, great resolution, and competitiveness. Could use a few patches here and there but it's in alpha state, I say this game will be close to flawless once launch hits.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Best racing sim i've ever played on PC. Few things i really like. The slow motion when watching the replay, the FFB on my G25 and 27 feels like the car is on the road and not floating unlike other racing sims. Graphics and engine sounds are good as well.Only thing is that this game has few cars and tracks at the moment. Cant wait to play the complete ver of this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I recommend this game with a real Driving Wheel and gas pedals.Otherwise, the turn radius with controllers are very large, and forget about Keyboard and mouse.The sound assets are purely amazing, with good headphones you feel the engine shake in your ears!This game is only for serious racer, it is NOT an arcade game like NFS or Burnout.Caution: This game is heavy in graphics, I suggest a decent GPU (R9 270X or GTX 760Ti and higher) before buying this product.

This review contains spoilers!Kunos Simulazioni has put in very hard work to create something like this especially in early access or alpha version. I think the game will advance after every single version developers will made so that Assetto Corsa will become a perfect PC simulator game. I also love that the developers have included 114 Steam achievements in the game so far.Overall driving physics and especially drifting is amazing, I have not enjoyed something like that before. Sound also is mind-blowing. I recommend it to everyone who loves sports, simulation and racing games.By akuustik from Latvia. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								If iRacing and rFactor had a baby this would be the outcome, the AI is still a bit dodgy and sometimes doesn't acknowledge you're right there with them but they keep improving it and can't go anywhere but up. The feeling of the sim is pretty much right on point (using G27 wheel) being smooth and not overdriving is key or you'll end up scrubbing speed and losing time, once you get the feeling and get accustomed you'll start to see the rewards this sim will give you for respecting it. This is no arcade type sim, so don't buy this if you plan on driving it like you would on forza or need for speed.  Can't wait to see what they come up with once it's fully released with online, this will give iRacing a run for its money especially when Nurburgring Nordschleife is on this service.

								I have them all, every racing simulator on the PC, PS3 and XBox.  Even without AI or racing online, in this early stage for the simulator it is the best.This is the most immersive and realistic feeling simulator I have driven using my Fanatec CSR Elite and Pedals.If I had all day I'd write a detailed review but for now, all I can say is get it or you're missing out on a whole lot of fun and the best racing simulator about with Project CARS a close second.Apart from the fantastic driving experience, I love the fact I can dial down the frame rate and have my GPU running at 38 degrees centigrade vs. 78-82 degrees centigrade in some other racing simulators while the graphics remain as good as any other simulator.

								My computer is under the minimun requirements (AMD Athlon II X2 255, 4Gb RAM and an Asus HD 5450 1Gb) and I've got a 90º wheel from Trust.After getting and testing the non-steam version of the 0.2 pre release and seeing that I can run the game at playable FPS (~30 @1280x720) I couln'd wait to play the 0.3 version. The release day for the 0.3 passed and I was checking so many times a day to see if there was a non-steam version of the 0.3 alvailable.After 3 or 4 days I couldn't wait anymore and bought the game on steam. 11/10 would buy again. My next move is going to be a Driving Force GT.Can't wait for what is to come - AI, Multiplayer, Asian and American Cars and new tracks. Keep it up Kunos!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hands down my favourite racing sim on the market. The only bad thing I can think of about this game is that the sounds are not up there with the likes of Raceroom Racing Experience. But then again not a lot is. The physics are really good imo however some people do not seem to think so. Also the FFB is really nice and gives you a good sense of how the car behaves and where the limit is. It is a highly moddable game with hundreds of mods already available from early access. I would highly reccomend this game to any with a keen eye on racing. You do not have to have a racing wheel to play this game but I would strongly suggest you invest as it is a comepletely different experince and one that is worth the money that it costs. So overall, go purchase this game right now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												//Post-Release Update//Best and most realistic racing sim yet. It's like driving a real car. Never had that feeling in a game before.  And I really appreciate the mod support, because it is a nice counteracting force to the small assortment of cars and tracks. The graphical presentation is delightful with 4x MSAA +  4x SGSSAA. Caution: AC isn't made for people who wanna enjoy a career mode or race weeks, which is at least for me not a problem. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just bought this game and after playing for few hours,Its Awesome!If you like games like Rfactor Iracing and other Racing Simulation's.You will have a blast, and with mod support it can be a game to play for years if it all goes well.And if the devs keep supporting and updating the game.Finaly a PC Race game that has nice laserscanned-tracks, and good FFB exept Iracing with is to expensive if you want it all.The physics are very well done and you can feel the track grip verry good.And a big plus it the cockpit view that you can adjust on the go!It looks verry natural and with a higher res than 1920* it will look awesome.The car collection is not as big as in some other games but make up for it in quallity.And there are aready some good cars and tracks to download as mods.more DLC's still coming,So overall im very pleased with the game, and hope content will continu to grow.If you like sim racing games you must have this one in your collection!

												Superb racing simulation.  Playing the first 4 hours of the newly released career I was unable to put this game down.  I feel as if I have just driven 4 hours on a real track.  The steering feel and weight are perfect, the feeback through the wheel means you can push the cars to find the limit just as you would in real life.  There is no need to use the 'dotted racing line' on screen as you can feel the cars through the corners.  In the front wheel drive cars understeer is telegraphed and easy to feel as you reach the limit of grip.  More impressively oversteer in cars like the E90 M3 starts with a slight pull on the wheel in opposite to the direction of travel - an excellent simulation of the yaw effect which gives you plenty of warning to react and correct.  A simulation as close to reality as I've experienced, the cars feel properly hooked up to the track.  Well worth the money.Updated for the Steam Awards, Assetto Corsa deserves a shot in the Test of Time category because here is a game from 2014 that even today gets plenty of play time.  They've continued to improve the game and it remains a gem on the pc.VR support is also superb in this game, try the latest Porsche 919 for the full effect, incredible.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

My only complaints are of the mostly empty  mulitplayer, though this may be due to thew fact I perfer to play singleplayer only. If you are like me and have a vested intrest in cars or wish to get into sim racing AC is the perfect game for you and now is an exellent time to start as 2016 loooks to be the game's biggest year development and content wise and with support like that I'm bound to enjoy this game for years to come.

												I tried many driving sims. I started with F1 GP2, I love LFS, rFactor, I also bought Project Cars. But this..., this is f...ng amazing. Driving model is brilliant, graphics are almost photoreal, no unnecessary eycandy. Tracks are laserscanned, cars are licensed and feel and look great and very convincing. Steering wheel is absolutely essential for this title. With keyboard or controller You' ll only get frustrated. Well, it's realistic so pretty damn hard, but if you're dedicated petrolhead go for it, it's worth every money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Brilliant sim. Its only getting better in my opinion, with more tracks and cars being released all the time.There are a few flaws though, like the Career mode, Force feedback and the online multiplayer (Although that is still in beta.) There is no 'Host' multiplayer button in game on assetto corsa, you have to run your own dedicated server which can be a pain with some routers. Dedicated servers are really good, but i would like to be able to play in private servers with my friends so we dont have to race against people who are likely to hit you off etc. The career mode is in my opinion pretty poor. Its just like a challenge mode, there is no type of series or championships like you would get on other games. There are just time trails, 5 lap races on different tracks with different cars but its really boring and i dont get any sense of achievement even when i do get the gold medal. Im hoping for an improvement so i can play single player, and actually enjoy it! The FFB is okay, its improving but there can be some dodgy moments where you feel like the car is stepping out on you, but it is not and when you go to correct the car, it simply spins the other way. I dont know if thats just with the DFGT Wheel but it certainly can be annoying. However, driving on this game is brilliant. The cars all feel different to eachother, the graphics in the cockpits look real, you can even change your on board settings to fit the 1st person view to where you are comfertable. When you get your wheel settings right, there is literally 0 input lag, so when you move your wheel, it moves in sync with the onscreen wheel perfectly giving you more precise controls with the car.It has a selection of amazing tracks, like Silverstone, Spa, Nurburgring, Imola and you can also add mods to your game which expands the variety even more. The more i play the game, the more i like it and with future DLCs and more mods i can only see the game going forwards. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Asseto corsa is a game were you race. But not only that you can drift and also do missions and other things that I never rember(I never try them). This game is also mutiplayer which is really nice to get those tandoms:). Also this game has very good wheel support. And let me tell you. Having a wheel in this game is like having food. Not saying that you have to have a wheel to play but it helps. Also there are mods. Sadly no steam workshop but there are still mods. I do recomed this game to people who like playing with friends, drifting, and just driving in genral. So what are you wating for? GET DRIFTING!!!!!!!!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a really great racing game. The cars feel like cars, or at least as close as a game can get. They handle as a real car would, the way they shift, and RPMs hit is bang on. This is almost as fun as actually tearing around in my actual car.However, this is not a game for causuals. It's difficult, especially if you're only using a gamepad like I am. Handling this realistic without actually being in the car is hard to manage. You can't feel all the minor bumps, and the G-force, and the wind like a real car. You feel like you're driving an actual car, but disconnected.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awesome game, definitely worth the money for what you get. Although there are still things that would be good to have, it has a very nice physics engine, realistic graphics, options like triple screen/occulus rift/full analogic pedals-steering-handbrake etc.New versions some times have downloadable free content like a new car or track.

												Playing this with an Oculus Rift DK2 and a Thrustmaster TX wheel.This is a really thoughtful, polished, restrained car sim. No, there aren't a ton of tracks. But the ones I've tried so far are fantastic. There aren't a billion cars, but every one I've tried feels exactly right, looks great, and they're extremely diverse. You can drive Niki Lauda's Ferrari 312T around the Nurburgring. And it'll feel like it.They're still making major improvements, too. Like, brand new race AI? Brand new tire model? Sure! Makes an excellent tarmac companion to Dirt Rally. Much, much, much more enjoyable and of consistently high quality than Project CARS.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I only have a few hours in so far, and it's still in Early Access, but i have nothing but great things to say about Assetto Corsa. I have put thousands of hours into the Gran Turismo games, and i was hesitant to start playing a new racing game. But with a new computer build i felt like i had to try it out. This game is great, great customization of the controls, especially with the steering wheel, i have a Logitech Driving Force GT, and i can customize everything about the wheel, making it feel very realistic			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Outstanding driving simulator. Easily the most realistic physics and car feedback through the wheel I have ever felt outside of a real car. I own a BMW E30 with sports suspension, and handling of the ingame E30 M3 is absolutely spot on. The FFB effects using a G27 wheel are accurate, subtle, and give the feeling of being connected to a real car.Even at Beta 0.2, with loads more content and improvements yet to come, I can happily say this is the driving simulator we have been waiting for. Here is a formula proving how good is: Live for Speed x 10 + real cars and laser scanned tracks + nice graphics = Assetto Corsa = Driving Sim Nirvana			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Assetto Corsa is a visually stunning racing simulator. With graphics backed by solid physics and a fully customizable UI, this has the chance to revive PC racing sims. The contiually increasing selection of cars and tracks provide a variety of racing experiences. From normal curcit racing, to drifting, to drag racing, Assetto Corsa offers huge replayability. However, this game does have some things wrong with it. The AI are both too aggresive and not aggresive enough. Often, AI will come speeding down a straight into the back of anyone who happened to brake too early. Other times, they will refuse to pass someone they could easily overtake. The AI are racing on a two-lane road. If two cars are taking up the lanes ahead, the AI won't try and find a gap, but will instead follow angrily behind. Overall, Asseto Corsa is looking like it will be the game that revives PC racing sims. But it has quite a few things that need to be worked out before this can become a full game. I would recomend this game to die-hard racing fans, but wait for a full release for casual gamers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off, the necessities:1) You WILL need a proper wheel. Think Logitech G25/ G27/ G920, Thrustmaster T300rs/ T500rs, Fanatec CSR etc. FORGET about using the keyboard or even a controller.2) You WILL need to learn the very basics of going fast. Wide in, tight through, wide out; Do most of your braking before entering the turn; Learn the braking zones.3) You WILL, most likely (depending on your previous experience with racing sims or real racing), experience a very hard learning curve before you're going to be able to compete for 1st place. And this is only the AI, I haven't experienced online racing yet so can't comment there.4) You WILL, eventually, start fiddling with car settings to gain a fraction of a second in your laptimes.Now then, with that out the way, here's the rundown on the game itself: It is, in my experience, probably the most fun racing sim you can get as of right now. There is a satisfying selection of cars to choose from, with more being released in the form of reasonably priced DLC.This is a racing simulator, pure and simple. Do NOT expect this to allow you to customize cars in-game a la Gran Turismo or Forza. Again, this is a racing sim. You get in your car, you practice until your arms are numb, and then you practice some more.If you like racing, whether you're an actual racing driver, a weekend racer, or just always had aspirations of becoming a racing driver, get this game right now. You will likely love it to bits.If you're more into picking up a controller and just be able to compete straight away, this may not be the game for you. Even if you happen to fall into this category though, I would still recommend getting this, borrowing a wheel if you can, and just trying it... It's that fun and that addictive.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the best sim out right now!  I'm having a blast with it!  The physics of the game feel very natural, and so do the graphics.  So many mods to play around with, super easy to mod, and I have even created a number of tracks for it using Race Track Builder.  I mostly use this sim for rally play (with mods of course), because AI is average at best.  I prefer RF2 for curcuit racing, because their AI is far far ahead of anyone.  I can't speak much about multiplay, as I generally don't play it.  My Fanatac gear works great!  If you like sim racing games this is a must have!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								very good sim but still has its flaws  such as braking on non-ABS cars is just plain stupid  and needs refinement especially for ppl using 360 controller. loading up suspension to cut back another direction  in an S-bend will not work and actually causes you to lose grip. another ""BS"" moment. Also, really the level of car's grip on slow turns in this game is  just plain pathetic and almost laughably wrong even if following a race line.my truck handles better in real life than the M3 on this game so that should say something. i also believe the ""feeling of acceleration,speed, and decelleration is basically non existant. and makes me equate this game to driving as a i would assume a blowup doll might be to sex .  you may also care that all units of measurements in this game are metric so no MPH for us USA guys or girls. but overall a great game and possibly the best SIM on PC or console ,but Id really like to see it improved .

								Assetto Corsa offers an outstanding and unforgettable experience in the Oculus Rift DK2.  VR is the future of sim racing and if you have a VR+wheel+pedals setup you'd be crazy to not own AC.  Aside from its VR support, it's still quite solid in other areas.  Graphics, physics, sound, and UI are all good.  Multiplayer support is fair but improving.  Car modeling is very good on all fronts, especially the interior modeling.  Support for third-party content is excellent.  Even just one of the best third-party tracks is worth the (quite modest) purchase price of AC alone.  Seek out those tracks and you will be handsomely rewarded!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								To really find enjoyment in this game, you have to like racing games, and preferably own a wheel. I, unfortuantly, do not own a wheel, so this review comes from a gamepad standpoint. Overall, this game is brilliant. There isn't a better way to put it, and to get it for $20 was even better. I really appreciate the level of detail in each car, and each track. Driving them though can be annoying and not too entertaining. Get everything right though, and it's a memorable experience.The controls are the biggest drawback here. Like I said above, unless you own a wheel, you are not going to have a great time. I spent quite a bit of time just tweaking settings trying to get everything to an acceptable level. Even now I am not thrilled with the control layout and feel I currently have. Back to the cars, and the game. The menu can be a bit confusing at start, and the depht of cars isn't great. Tracks suffer the same thing too. The cars though are models very well, although I cannot comment on the accuracy of the physics models behind each one. If you are looking for a good racing game, Assetto Corsa is one that has a lot of potential, but don't expect to be immediatlly thrilled by it. It takes time, and a lot of tweaking, to really make the most out of this game. Once you get past that though, there is a lot of fun to be had.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is an okay game. It could use a better SDK and the ability for players to modify already released cars so that they can drive them with different specs from the default, but otherwise, this is an okay racing game. It needs some music, and has some twitchy controls with steering wheels, but supports practically all steering wheels even the driving force GT steering wheel.-- Content Creation --If you are like me and into content creation. You can make your own tracks using the Assetto Corsa track, make car retextures, create a custom car based on the Formula K car that Assetto Corsa comes with and more. I've only done the car retextures and gotten tracks that other modders have made. This helps to make this among the best racing games out there in my opinion. Especially since there are a lot of modders out there trying to make content for this game.-- Steering wheel controller --Works mostly with the Logitech G27 steering wheel, but the steering wheel's shift indicator doesn't work... (( Look below for solution to this )) It's okay, though kind of takes away from the feel of the game for me. The game with this steering wheel will shift in such a way that allows you to use the manual shifter (H-pattern) when in a car that has an H-pattern shifter, otherwise you're restricted to the paddle shifters for those cars that have that. I prefer the H-Pattern shifter, but there many cars in the game that don't use that shifter. -- Other issues --Currently no career mode, and when its added hopefully it won't force people to drive all manner of cars... Currently some cars are very twitchy if you accelerate oddly quick. This is mostly something from the high horsepower cars.-- Solutions to problems above --* Steering wheel issue with G27 and no LEDs use. Download FanaLEDs program, In FanaLEDs program do File - Open Settings, open Global, change revledtype to 1, then save, close FanaLEDs and reopen it. Now you can set up the RPM percentage you want to start counting at, for me this is 60%. And it will count up each LED on the steering wheel until about 500 RPMs before red line and at red line it will start flashing the LEDs to indicate that you need to shift up. I love Assetto Corsa now that this feature works, maybe they will make it so we don't need to use FanaLEDs to get this to work in the future.*** UPDATE as of Release Candidate 1.0.1 ***The game's cars don't act like the real world cars anymore. In particular, the production car ones. They feel too twitchy and act more like what you'd expect on an arcade game instead of being something like you'd get on a driving simulator game like GT5. Hopefully, they'll fix this for the actual release.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game is wildly fun and has levels of fun and complexity for virtually any player. The physics in the game are unbelievable, and it's a blast to play. Game is playable with a controller, (not very well in my opinion, I just don't like using my xbox controller) but I use a g27 with the pedals and the H-Shifter. Wildly fun, and still being updated regularly! Patches come quickly and the game developers actually seem to care about their product. If you can get it during the next steam sale (or now if you really want to), PICK THIS UP. There are tons of cars to choose from, many different tracks, and you can tackle the game with any skill level. As of right now, the developers are working on making the AI in the game more suited to race people, as sometimes there are tiny problems in the code causing a few cars to immediately pit and stay there, something or other--don't let this stop you though. The game is still in late alpha and this is to be expectedTl;dr - Game is still in late alpha, 100% playable. Can be played with a controller, I prefer a wheel. Cars, tracks, general improvements and rebalancing of cars as well as AI are still in progress. Physics are incredible, I've never played something more realistic on steam. PICK UP THIS GAME ASAP IF YOU'RE INTO DRIVING SIMULATORS THAT HAVE REALISTIC PHYSICS AND CAN BE PLAYED BY ANYONE!!! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I'm new to actual racing sims, having only played Forza 4 and F1 2012. I don't have a steering wheel and pedal set. I play Assetto Corsa with a PS3 gamepad. The game is early access and is, right now, a very good time trial simulator. The way I played it, being new to racing sims, was to pick a car and a track, and play the hell out of it (I picked the E92 M3 and Silverstone GP). I also tried the other cars a bit but my main focus was this car/track combo.If you are also new to racing sims, this is the right way to play, because you want to find out quickly if you can't enjoy racing sims. That is, if you can't enjoy playing the same car and track over and over, slowly eking out an extra second or fraction of a second through gradually better perception of the car's handling and of the track's quirks (because even simulated driving of cool cars on awesome tracks is always enjoyable). I found out I do enjoy racing sims. By now, I've played it well over a day of real time, have considered buying a wheel and pedals setup, and regularly read up on the cars' and tracks' real-life counterparts along with articles on how to drive faster and tune cars for racing. I consider myself obsessed with motorsport now, and I'm sure that when I get the wheel and pedals it's only going to get worse (better?). NB: I also went back and tried Forza 4 and F1 2012 for comparison. It is much easier to drive fast in Forza but I'm pretty sure that's the more forgiving physics model. Assetto Corsa is less forgiving but I feel it is more realistic and therefore I get into it more; it seems like I can make some rather serious mistakes in Forza and they won't matter. To me, F1 2012 actually doesn't seem that bad compared to Forza; it seems like the cars act like they do on TV. There is a fair amount of skill transfer to the Formula Abarth in Assetto Corsa, and F1 2012's video run-through's of tracks also help.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								One of the best simulators I've played. Im using a Logitech G25 and the compability between this wheel and the game is awesome. The looks of the game looks stunning aswell. Can't wait until they get more cars into the game and some new tracks. So far I have loads of fun ahead of me. Definetly worth the money!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Considering its half built this an awesome game for the motor racing fan, its got a lot more compelling now you can race the cpu. I thoroughly recommend it for the sim fan, and if your an arcade racer, give it a try as its cutting edge in terms of graphice and sounds plus it allows you to choose your difficulty level.

								very good sim but still has its flaws  such as braking on non-ABS cars is just plain stupid  and needs refinement especially for ppl using 360 controller. loading up suspension to cut back another direction  in an S-bend will not work and actually causes you to lose grip. another ""BS"" moment. Also, really the level of car's grip on slow turns in this game is  just plain pathetic and almost laughably wrong even if following a race line.my truck handles better in real life than the M3 on this game so that should say something. i also believe the ""feeling of acceleration,speed, and decelleration is basically non existant. and makes me equate this game to driving as a i would assume a blowup doll might be to sex .  you may also care that all units of measurements in this game are metric so no MPH for us USA guys or girls. but overall a great game and possibly the best SIM on PC or console ,but Id really like to see it improved .

								I recommend this game! I am a hardcore iRacing fan, and this game has the best physics ever! The cars are awesome to drive, and the sim can be hard at times. If you like hardcore sims, buy Assetto Corsa!!9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												BUY THIS GAME, surperb game every update it just gets better, and the game allows modding, multi player works great, drive a whole track right beside your mates and rub paint on their cars, it doen't send you all flying through the air, lap after lap of bumper rubbing fun. And now with PorscheDLC, this is the only game that impresses me day after day release after release.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game is EPIC. You want a real simulator game with epic graphics? You got it right here! This game is simple magnificent! The graphics are sublime and the cars seemed passed on a scanner so much they are real! The handling are realistic so are the assist in the game. You can turn on and off ABS, and Traction contrl (and on some car have different settings) while racing, making you have tail happy fun without quitting your session. The photo mode is Spectacular!!!! You can change everything in it!, change the daylight and sun position, making it perfect for simulating morning pictures, This game is spectacular, i have only a very short time on it for now, but ill make a new review as i go along. This game is worth every dollar. I paly with a gamepad, so my experiences isnt the best but its drivable. best would be a G27 wheel.10/10!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I've been playing for a little while now and the driving mechanics are awesome. The only reason I bought this game was because of the support for Oculus Rift Dk2 and then came to LOVE AC. I drive the lotus 98T without any driver assists except ABS and it gets my heart pumping and hands start to sweat when racing with others online. In the rift you can really ""Feel"" the G's as the car goes into a corner or when doing an inertia drift. I play this over Project Cars because of how the cars feel. The lotus 98t is much more manuverable in Assetto Corsa and even sounds awesome with the turbo spooling up and down. If you buy it you wont regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								It is the best racing game I have ever felt with my racing wheel, it is just SO GOOD. I don't know if i have ever felt so synced to a game like in this one, it just feels amazing! I've had all Gran Turismos and played Forza loads of times and I have always wanted a game similar to Forza on Xbox or GT on Playstation and I think I finally got it. The Menus look ASTONISHING! The GUI on this is just awesome and I can't wait for the multiplayer and for more cars to be released. I am really looking forward for this, by far the best racing game on PC whatsoever.-Fatal1ty.
