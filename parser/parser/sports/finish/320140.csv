												Tokyo Drift? Initial D? VDrift? If anything of this appeals to you, this might too.In any case, this game's remarkable. It's challenging, exciting and unforgiving. But let me tell you, it's just as satisfying once you get a feel for it.You start out in a minimalistic world, sitting in the infamous Toyota Trueno AE86. Your destiny? Drift. A brief tutorial follows, which will probably result in you crashing into walls a lot, but that's fine, as nothing else really is needed to understand how this game works! The game then releases you into a free-roaming environment with a few missions you have to do to unlock more stages. You can then also select stages, cars and tracks once in Free-roam mode, a bit like in NFS or other racing titles.As you get more familiar with the controls, the stages get more exciting and challenging/longer. They also come in several formats: Lap-based drift-tracks, Driftkhana, which is a highscore time-attack inside an arena, or mountain sprint tracks. The goal is always the same, drift gracefully, score points, interact with objects such as poles to drift past or boxes to shatter, add that up to the final score and remain away from hitting walls or losing your combo. Sounds easier than it is, trust me, the Japanese themed tracks and names will kick into your curb at first.That said, car handling is the key, each car has their own way of handling, so finding what suits you most will be the way to go. Ontop of that, drifting's the deal, so going fast won't always be the key to success either. Manual or automatic shifting? How high should be the turning sensitivity? Well, all these factors will help you optimize your driving style, making it possible to reach up to be the drift king.I personally had, and will have a blast with this title in the future. It's been a while since I found an appealing drifting/racing experience and I can safely say this game has done it right. Now go... Go... and be the next Drift-King.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's spinning drifting time! Pros:+ 6 different cars to drive+ Has achievements and trading cards+ Controller support, with smooth controls+ Fitting soundtracks to add to your ""Leet driving skillz"" + 3 game modes to play for leaderboard lovers with 24+ levels+ Free roam is interesting and fun, featuring themed levels, range of missions and good level designNeutral Points:> No multiplayer, which is a shame because I feel it would be fun> Difficulty, getting used to the drifting is not easy, can be frustrating when trying to get that high scoreCons:- Price tag is too high for what the game offers- Game is short, offering roughly 3 hours of content- No replayability, boring after you've completed it all- Controls are sensitive, spinning out or losing control is commonRandom totally (not) true notes: None of the cars have cup holders, blue shells from mario kart have a slight chance to appear from another dimension and mess you up, and drifting doesn't mean drift to sleep (I learned that the hard way and spilt my coffee)Download Size: 421mbTrading cards: 6 cards in the setAchievement Difficulty: Moderately difficultHours to 100%: 3+Rating: 7.5/10Recommendation: Grab it on a big sale for a couple hours of driving, sliding, crashing and attempted drifting. I'd recommend a controller too. Not worth the full price howeverMy opinion:Interesting and entertaining, it does what it sets out to do well. It is ok for one playthrough but is boring after, plenty to do if you like getting your name on the leaderboards but the drifting takes a good while and some practice to get good with. Difficult without practice but once you got the drifting down getting all the achievements are easy. Levels are nicely designed and the free roam is fun to play, the 3 other modes are somewhat fun but more for the competitive types trying to get the highest scores/times. For the full price tag of £8.99 it's not worth it in my opinion, best get it heavily discounted. I feel it would of been nice to have some multiplayer, maybe then it would be worth the price.

 PROS++ Great aesthetic with superb use of minimalistic design and an awesome sound track+ Drifting feels realistic and responsive, helped by the inclusion of both manual and automatic modes+Free Roam and tutorials teach you everything you need to know in order to work towards mastering the game CONS--No ghosts for event mode, something I consider absolutely essential in any game focusing on trials-Will be very difficult for those unfamiliar to the realistic racing genre way of drifting-No multiplayer, nor is there likely to be multiplayerAbsolute drift may not be for everyone, but those looking for a realistic drifting racer experience will enjoy this game immensely. All three modes in the game, Drift, Driftkhana, and Free-Roam teach you the skills required for drifting in addition to providing dozens of hours of replayability for those attempting to get the best scores possible. The game is incredibly challenging, and posting top scores to the leaderboards for the event mode levels will be reserved for only the best of the best as the skill ceiling for the game is incredible high.

												Let me try to describe how I feel about this game. In fact, let me swoon over it, let me drool all over my keyboard. This game feels absolutely perfect. Surely it is not a perfect game as there should/could be still some content added like maybe a simple map designing tool (with workshop support?). This game actually looks very simple, the surface is white and each of your tyres leaves skidmarks to see how smoothly each of your four wheels cleared a corner. Important things are coloured red. I am not cutting to the chase, but the feeling of ""Absolute Drift"" is just great. this game lets you peacefully control a car sliding around a menu-like open map with objectives to do and areas to unlock. There are special tracks for each gamemode which can be entered. The atmosphere is well-rounded with an electronic soundtrack, subtle tyre squealing and rich car sounds.I like to drive the car of my family in real life and I got experience with racing games like ""Live For Speed"", ""SHIFT 2 Unleashed"" or ""BeamNG.drive"". So before I tried this game I already had some drifting experience (using a steering wheel), which most likely helped me get into this game quickly.If you are not sure, whether you like the game mechanics, you can check for a demo on indieDB, though it is by far not as developed as the final game.So should you buy this game and support the developers? Definitely, yes!Well, given that you are into going sideways, but if you are looking at this, you probably are.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Absolute Drift is a *gasp* drifting game. Of course the most important part of a vehicle game of any sort are the controls. I will admit that the controls in Absolute Drift are quite tight while the driving itself does feel a bit too slippery, but as you might guess it’s not a big deal in a game where your only goal is to slide stylishly. Absolute Drift also boasts a unique Japanified minimalist aesthetic, paying homage to one of the origins of the drifting motorsport. It isn’t all roses but let’s not hesitate to pop the hood and see what we got, this is Absolute Drift.Free Roam mode serves as the Story Mode, and will serve to introduce you to the controls as well as different challenges and events. After spinning out a few times and learning the art of counter-steering you will begin to grasp what the game is really all about and because there is very little hand-holding, conquering a world challenge or topping the global highscore for any track feels like a great accomplishment. Absolute Drift has a total of 23 tracks to enjoy; 10 circuit Drift tracks, 9 open-world Driftkhana courses, and 4 one-way Mountain Drift tracks, so you can find the event that suits you best.While the world challenges and events have as much variety as can be expected, I find that it still isn’t quite enough. Drift around this, drift between that, it isn’t until the last stage that things start getting really interesting. All I’m saying is I wanted to jump on a few more roofs. Car customization is limited to 6 body-types, which all have a slightly different feel. You can also pick a color and a decal, but nothing beyond that. I would really like a chance to fine-tune my engine and shocks. Stripped-down customization and lack of real-time damage are gigantic missed opportunities.I enjoyed my time with Absolute Drift, with its low-key dance music soundtrack, inoffensive looks, and high degree of mastery. Lack of customization and content hurts replayability, but the difficulty curve and global scoreboards means it still has quite a bit to offer. The story mode can be completed in around 2 hours, and if that’s all you’re buying this game for then $12 might be a bit overpriced. It is a bit of a one-trick pony, but it does that trick extremely well. If you’re in the mood for a score-attack drifting game, give Absolute Drift a try. Though it might be worth waiting for a sale. Big thanks to Funselektor Labs for the review copy! We at IGB hope to see more quite soon.Gameplay:    Controls- 8/10    Fun Factor- 4/10    Difficulty- 3/10    Replayability- 8/10    Innovation- 7/10Aesthetic:    Graphics- 7/10    Music- 9/10    Sound FX- 6/10    Story/Lore- 1/10    Level Design- 6/10Final Score: 59/100 for replayability, controls, and music.Summary: Minimalist drifting simulator with a large degree of difficulty, and a rocking soundtrack.Verdict: A bit of a one-trick pony, but it does that trick exceedingly well.

So, here it is. My review.At time of posting, I have all the achievements and have 50 hours in the game.First of all, just a general comment: I love this game. It has a great, smooth game engine and the controls are fairly easy to me. It wasn't too hard to pick up, and learning some drifiting from Assetto Corsa and driving my Miata IRL, I can say that the physics are very realistic and it's easy to apply those skills into this game.Here's a list for the TL:DR, and it's at the top (you're welcome):Pros:- Smooth Game Engine- Difficulty Settings are Spot On- Controls on Every Difficultly Setting are Great- Music is Great (Especially C41; sorry Nyte, your music is still great, lol)- Colors are Great- Online Leaderboards- Fairly wide selection of Maps- Driftkhana, Drift Tracks, and Mtn Drift settings are awesome to choose from- Game is Updated at a Good Pace- Game as a Whole was Tailored for a Wide audience- Wide Range of Adjustable Graphics Settings to Fit your Performance Needs- Different cars fit different people, but aren't too unbalanced in terms of full capabilites.- Free-Roam. Yesssssss...- Less than 500 MB (currently)- Very Fair and Rewarding Point system that pushes you to try harderCons:- Non-customizable Controls (Steam Controller's Reprogramming Defeats this Con)- No-multiplayer, yet (for reasons)Otherwise, this game is perfect in my opinion.Okay, now the novel:Personal CommentsI have owned this game since August 2015 and have really been off and on with it. I can tell you that once I got a Steam Controller, everything changed, and I loved how the game played with it. Honestly, I couldn't play it on anything but the highest difficulty. PhysicsThe physics are phenomenal. I don't think I have ever played such an arcad-ey styled game with such realistic physics. It totally replicates real life (or damn near it) and the developer did such a great job with it. From what I have seen, there are no current bugs in the game's physics and I see no reason for the physics to be modified at all.GraphicsThe graphics are great aswell. I think that the color theme is perfect for the (not so much) ""JDM/Dorifto"" and (but more) Japan feel. It is a little brutal on the eyes when you're in a dark room or are very tired, but otherwise, it is very fun and keeps you alert. I really enjoy how the tire marks work. They really help when you are drifitng if you need to see if you're angle is going too far (genenrally more than 90º), and they look cool. The graphics, in general, may seem a little bland at times, but it really keeps you focused on what you're doing. Plus, this game isn't really about looks, it's more about the gameplay.Gameplay/ControlsAny kind of controller (I use a Steam Controller) is nearly a must. Keyboard is simply not enough to fully enjoy and get good at this game, but it is still playable. It really sucks that you can't change the controls in game, but the Steam Remapping or something like motioninjoy could help with that. The actual controlling on all difficulties is great and accurate to their names. The hardest difficulty feels butter smooth and is what I use all the time. If you take your time, you can really learn the game and get good with a car that fits you. I personally work well with ""The Original,"" but who knows what you might be great with. Also, there is always a mixture of challenging yourself, the music, and the map you're on that can give you different moods within the game.This game is also very fun and easy to get back into and keep with. I think that in general, it may get boring after you completely master (rank 1) all of the maps and finish the campaign, but it would take a long time (probably no less than 150 hours) before you get to that point. At least for me, the game pushes me to try harder and be the best at any map I try. I am currently, as of this review, number 4 on Mt. Nikko with about 300,000 points to go to number 1. It's taken me about 15 hours to get to that point and I don't plan on stopping until I am at number 1.Last WordsThis game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. I don't even think curse words can explain how awesome this game is. I think that the game has come a very long way in the past 9 months and I think that it has amazing potential. funselektorlabs deserves a lot of credit for the creation of this game. I can't wait to see how this game evolves because it would be a shame if it were to stop where it is. However, it wouldn't be horrible because the game is already amazing as-is.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Points SystemThe point system is very fair and I think I have it figured out, in general. Here's my thoughts:- Depending on drifting direction, a sideways-sliding score is given, and it's when the most rear wheel in a drift (if you're going right, it's the rear right) is farther out than the forward wheel (if you're drifting around a right corner, it's your left front, and vice-versa):- This is the general ""drifitng score.""- The wider the angle up to a 90º drift is more points- You get a multiplier based upon how long you have been drifing ""continuously""- If you're going too slow, the points stop adding- If you go over 90º, the points stop adding- If you hit anything, except bonuses, your points are summed in the total and you lose your multiplier- If you stop drifing for too long (I think about 5 seconds), your points are summed in the total and you lose your multiplier- Extra points are given when you go around a bonus pole:- The closer you are, the more points you get- The faster you are going, the more points you get- If you're too far away or ""aren't drifitng"" near one, it doesn't count- If you hit one, it doesn't count, but doesn't get rid of your score or multiplier- Extra points are given when you hit a red block:- If you hit it you get points- If you don't hit it, you get no points- Faster and more Sideways you are, you get more points- Extra points are given when you go around a donut circle (driftkhana only):- If you finish the donut indicated with the increasing red circle, you get more points- Faster and more Sideways you are, you get more points- If you hit it, you get no points- Extra points are given when you spin in a ""spin-zone"" (driftkhana only):- If you finish the spinning indicated with the increasing red circle, you get more points- There's really no downside to these...- Points are inceased exponentially (I don't know how much the curve is) if you stack bonuses in one ""continuous"" drift:- If you keep getting bonuses, they'll exponentially increase- If your current score is reset, so does your bonus stack			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Absolute Drift is one of the best drifting and car related games ever made. If not THE best.  The game is incredibly simple at face value, which lends to the game being both aesthetically and mechanically perfect. Its top down perspective and simple visuals work fantastic together. You get a broad view of your canvas, allowing you to cut amazing drifts and prepare where to go to create the best line. The cars to choose from (including a BMW, an AE-86, a Supra, all made as generic cars with nods to their real life counterparts) are incredible. Again- all this is due to its simplicity, and the simplicity was very goal driven by design. When you look at your car- it gives the same feelings you had with your Hotwheels as a kid, they all control as people expect them to (The AE-86 is so well balanced it's essentially all I use, just like the the real life Toyota is percieved to be) .... They perform as your tool to navigate the perfect drift, and at the same time they are the tip of your paint brush that is marking the canvas laid out before you- painting the world in black ink as you weave and arc your way around- the sound of your rev pinging and tires squeeling as you yank the E-Brake and swing back the other way is spot on. //Drifting as an art.That's the beauty of this game. It gets Drift culture better than any other video game before it. It doesn't slap you in the face with popular culture, icons, brands... It bleeds the emotion and style of Drifting, and that's it. The only real world reference beyond the cars themselves, are the Torii that dot the landscape, which are the gateways to the next chapter in free-roam... And the japanese chimes that play as you make your way to the next level. (Remember their use in this?

 ...Fantastic)  The Japanese imagery and use of a paint-brush on canvas visual style bleeds Drifting as an art form. A pure form of expression through controlling a car. It's respectful to the art, but mechanically this is incredible as well. //Pitch perfect Drifting mechanicsThe game will start you off and tell you how to drift- it puts you through a simple tutorial before letting you loose on this clean playground- a playground with real world objects... Ferris wheels that make me think of the pier in LA, train yards and other construction type objects that help me to imagine drifting in big open back lots late at night. It's all so clean and perfect that  much like reading a book, it allows you to fill in the blanks with your own perception of the craft. Just the way it should be. But again, the craft itself is just as important- and the tutorial gets you on the path and then drops you in to learn the rest yourself. The other major part of pure drift-culture is failure and success. Learning your car, learning physical limitations, tinkering with your setup (in this case the controls to match your comfort, turn sensitivity and ""difficulty"" which to me is more of a way that the car acts- try medium and hard as well, as you may find the car acts a bit more like it should in your mind) ... Failing and trying again until you learn how to drift and master a course. That's the thing about drifting and people who actually do it. It's a comradery thing- it's something you don't learn over night, it's not all about showing off and looking ""hella dope"" ... It's about mastering something with a deep learning curve and perfecting it. It's about risk and reward. For a top-down arcade style racer, this game allows you to do just that, while still BEING A VIDEO GAME and not a NASA-sponsored sim of the craft itself. I can't say this enough, aesthetically and mechanically this game NAILS the art and culture of drifting better than any game before it, and likely after it too.//Presentation is everythingAnd present it does. It is effortless here. No obnoxious menus to slog through. You can go back to the main menu from a course in free-roam nearly instantly, and the music doesn't change either. That's a BIG thing too. The music is perfect ambient EDM tracks. All majorly chill. They all fit and hit the modern car-culture perfectly and enhance your driving experience while doing it. The first track to start when I loaded up the game the first time was perfect- with an awesomely simple title splash that slides perfectly into the game as you hit Enter... The game feels perfectly put together. Every piece fits seamlessly... And as I swap to a different mode or back out and the music doesn't suddenly cut or change- that helps to make the package feel that much more ""whole"" and perfect.Simplicity here is key. The game doesn't use simplicity to hide faults it possibly could have if they added more- it uses it so that you notice and gravitate to the things you SHOULD while playing it. The mechanics and ink-brush style of your drift. It's zen. Absolute Drift is Zen. Fun to play for a couple minutes while waiting for your friends to get grouped for a dungeon in WoW or Competitive CS GO. Fun to play with your coffee while you wake up. Fun to just play for hours with no interest in doing anything else- just to top the leaderboards or channel your inner DK. Absolute Drift is just that- Absolute Drift.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""Buddha & drifts""This game is brillliant. As if micromachines is revived and some devs that have watched too much Fast & Furious 3:Tokyo Drift. The graphics are minimalistic like in Mirror's Edge. White surfaces and only the important objects are marked red. In each of the 5 total levels you have to complete little jobs like drift under tubes or jump on top of houses via ramps. Basic shops are spreaded over the map with paintshop service or car model exchange. I liked most ""the Super"" and ""das Whip"". You can also find all event race tracks during your playthrough. The jungle soundtrack is fast paced drum& bass or jungle music. Lateron I figured out you can even change your car from automatic to manuell gears and deactivate steering suppport. Which can be useful for pro players. What I've seen I can't believe my eyes. They perma-drift through all levels and gain much more than 10 mio points on it. I was lucky with my 2 Mio for the last achievement.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've had tears of joy playing this game to completion, which is a rarity, I will say.Absolute Drift is a top down, minimalistic stunt driving game. Your goal: become a master drifter, by refining the art of spinning out and smashing into walls controlling oversteer and burning rubber.For the aesthetics: it's low poly, simple graphics, with most buildings and roads left white and untextured. Objects of interest are coloured red, blue or yellow. Your car leaves behind skidmarks wherever it goes, whether you slide or not, which allows for impressive drawings on tarmac, or a nice spiral when you catch some big air.The soundtrack is a relaxing, upbeat electronic and DnB by Nyte and C41 respectively - which fits the near zen-like atmosphere of the game. Cars have simple, but distinct engine noises, with more subtle transmission whine or turbo flutter.The gameplay is the purest I've seen in modern driving games. It's you, your car, your skills and the track. Whether free-roaming, doing driftkhanas or mountain drifts, almost everything revolves around getting your back end slideways and very, very smokey. You have a selection of 6 cars to choose from, each performing differently from one another - some are heavier, some are more stable, some are more tail happy. All can be repainted and given a little livery. You'll spend most of your time smacking against walls drifting in an open-ended hub world, peppered with missions to perform - stuff like ""drift between this and this"" or ""donut around this"". Finishing the campaign takes around 1.5 hours, but you also have specific tracks - the aforementioned driftkhanas, mountain drifts and circuit drifts, containing Steam leaderboards that will push you to improve your scores.Let's not beat around the bush; the game is hard. The handling is intentionally challenging. Unless you're careful, it doesn't matter whether you use the gamepad or the keyboard, you WILL spin out and hit walls, and the game knows it. There are several difficulty settings to pick from, which change how grippy your car is, but above all, mastery of counter-steer, weight transfer, grip limit, torque and gearing is paramount to any decent drifting in this world. This results in one of the most satisfying moments I've ever experienced in videogames: the flow of stringing together perfect drifts through a tight and twisty track, losing as little momentum as possible and rocketing to the top. The execution of the handling is absolutely STELLAR.The game has finally been upgraded to the Zen Edition, bringing forth a new event type - Midnight Drifts, which are really really challenging! In addition, you have Event Challenges to unlock said Midnight Drifts, REPLAYS and GHOSTS on the tracks! This is the kind of free content that will exponentially boost the game's longevity, even if a level editor or proper multiplayer still don't quite exist yet. I'd liken this game as the Portal of driving games: a clean art style, a short campaign that doesn't overstay its welcome, if it's not over too quick, a dash of humour and one of the best (top down, minimalistic, very very slideways) driving experiences I've had in my long years of driving/racing games. I f-ing love it!Get it ASAP if you like/love cars, but even if you don't it's worth a try for the experience and the challenging but rewarding gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

├Professors Review┤Overall Score95/100Game Pros • Clean and simple menu • Nice Drum & Bass and Electronic music by C41 and NYTE • Diversity in tracks (Becomes availble as you play through free roam) • Automatic/Manual transmission • Diversity in cars (Unlockable through free roam) • Challenging (You wont be a pro right from the start, takes time) • Leaderboards (Global/Friends filter) • Full controller support • Ghost cars and replays • 3 Game Modes: Driftkhana, Drifting, & Mountain Drifting with 24+ levelsGame Cons • No multiplayer (Drifting in tandem would be incredible) • The noise you get when you lose your combo is pretty loud compared to game audioRelateable Games  • N/A ConclusionAbsolute Drift is an incredible game. I've spent hours playing a single map trying to get the highest global score (Currently in the top 40 on the Oval track). When I dont feel like playing anything else, or im just in the mood to make some sick skids, this is the game I go to. Don't get discouraged if you crash a lot in the start, follow the tips and youll be a drift god in no time.(If you found this review helpful, consider giving it a thumbs up!) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Yeah this is hella fun! Although there is quite a learning curve, in my opinion - which I like. At first everything feels fairly 'icy', but ya just got take it easy with going full throttle and learning to over/under steer.Pros:+Beautiful minimalistic graphics+Easy to learn, hard to master+Cool meta levels, sorta reminds me a bit of Tony Hawk+I like how leaderboards give you statistics about what percentile you rank in compared to the public at large+Music is pretty awesomeCons:-Feels fairly icy, and requires some time to get used to (could be a 'Pro' depending on how you feel)-Some of the 'challenges' on the meta levels are kinda dumb and can be cheesed to achieveTotally worth it, IMO, if you like racing games.

""Absolute Drift"" Review *Disclaimer: This game was purchased for personal use, not provided by a developer. Absolute Drift, herein abbreviated as AD, is essentially a minimalistic casual driving game. You play from a 3D, third person “top-down” perspective, as you traverse 7 worlds completing various drifting tasks. The goal? Become a master drifter, sliding over water and doing donuts around Ferris Wheels. Here are a few things worth noting. Art Style The elegant contrast of white landscapes against bright red obstacles is the key idea behind the art style of AD. The graphics look gorgeous with their minimalistic textures and subtle physics. As you drive through stacks of blocks, you’ll be blown away at how the particles just seem to fall away without hesitation. The soundtrack is perfectly suited for the game, and huge props to the artists for their great work in that department. Difficulty The game seems simple at first – get your car sideways, countersteer, and you’re set. It’s not quite that easy. In free roam you will learn how to stay in drifts and exit the drift whenever you need to. Meanwhile, you can use various events to hone your skills on-track. There’s no difficulty toggle here – in events you are ranked against other players in global and friend-based rankings. Length, Story, Etc. One of the only gripes I had with this game was the length of the free roam world. There are seven “worlds” you go through before having to resort to replaying tracks over and over just to beat your own times. I would love to see a co-op or even online 1-on-1 game mode in this, and it would definitely give it a bit more reason to play beyond free-roam. Performance AD runs phenomenally on my rig, as I expected. However, as with all my reviews, I tested the game on Intel Integrated Graphics to see how well it would do for casual gamers. It ran at a solid 35 or so fps, definitely within a playable range. You could likely push it to 50 by playing 1280x720 windowed.Do I like this game? Absolutely. (Pardon the pun) I would recommend it to anyone looking for a game that they can complete with 100% achievements in less than 5 hours.

												I didn't know anything about Absolute Drift before buying it, but I knew I liked racing, drifting and that this game had a large portion of positive reviews. So I thought, ""why not?"". Here's what I think of this game after a few hours of play:Graphics: I've always been a huge fan of minimalist/subtle designs, and Absolute Drift pretty much nails that. Everything has a low polygon count. The track is white, the important things are red and the death zone (water) is blue. This very small color palette is great because you can very quickly understand any situation you are in, but it also carries a message that, I think, translates the game well: ""No BS, just drifting"".The black skidmarks felt kind of strange at first because they are here even when not drifting, but then I understood they were here to serve as a visualization of your driving, because they contrast the pure white track. By simply looking at the skidmarks, you can judge how well your took that last corner. More simply, it just looks nice.On a more technical aspect, at the time I am writing this, the game is very poor. The graphical options are very limited: no custom resolutions, no V-Sync and the graphical quality is limited to a few presets, which means you can't set the anti-aliasing, texture filtering, etc. on your own. Then again, the game launched very recently, so I have faith the developer will add those options later.Audio: The cars sound good, you can really feel how powerful they are when accelerating and the hissing sound of the tires when drifting is satisfying. The soundtrack blends in very well with the game. It's all electro music (like Drum & Bass), but all of the tracks are very calm. It was a good choice to make the soundtrack relaxing because the player will spend a lot of time failing and retrying, but the tranqulity of those tunes help remain calm.Gameplay: Here comes the most important part, and fortunately, it's the best. The control scheme is pretty much what you'd expect in any driving game: Left-Right-Accelerate-Brake-Handrake-Gear up-Gear down. Learning how the game works takes two minutes at worst, but knowing how to handle the cars themselves is a harder task. You cannot make a normal turn in this game, you will always slide. On top of that, the cars feel very heavy: even when you think you're going pretty slow, drifting will barely make you deccelerate and you will very often end up in a wall because of that at the beginning. When you get the hang of this, however, driving becomes a very smooth experience. You can easily chain multiple drifts and properly gauge acceleration/decceleration.The developper made the very interesting decision of only giving the player an isometric point of view instead of the good old 1st/3rd person cameras you can find in other racing games. It's quite useful because it allows the player to see further ahead than they normally could, and plan their drifts in consequence.Content: The game is split in two modes: Free-roam, where you drive in open spaces completing missions (which usually are ""drift near this"", ""donut around that"", etc.) to open new worlds where you complete more missions, and Events where you can choose to play on either Tracks (with 3 laps), Driftkhanas (small, open spaces where you must score as many points as possible in 2 minutes) and Mountain Drifts (tracks where you drift downhill to the end). There is, at the time of writing, 5 worlds and 24 tracks. The 5 worlds can be completed in about an hour or two and each world also unlocks various Events and one car.Something unfortunate is that all cars are, unless I have not played enough to realize the difference, model+sound swaps. It would have been nice to give all cars a different handling, but perhaps the dev will add this in the future.The good thing about Events is their replayability and the presence of a Leaderboards system. If you want to climb that ladder you will have to master every corner of every track, which is not an issue given how good the cars feel. The large amount of hours sinkable justifies, I believe, the price tag.One thing I would really love to see is the addition of a map maker (perhaps with Workshop integration) in order to enhance the lifespan of this game.In conclusion, I would definitely recommend this little gem if you are the kind of person who likes spending a large amount of time on a single game in order to master it.

												I bought this game while it was on sale.  Me and my friend beat the game 100%.  It was mostly my friend though.Its a good game.  The game's sole focus is drifting.  Its not about upgrades and such, its all about drifting.  Theres no enemy AI to race against or anything like that.  Pros:fun gameplaylooks good in its own wayvery satisfying game to be good atyou can drive manualeasy with controller (I didnt play it with mouse and keyboard so I cant say how good it is with that setup)Cons:-Engine sounds could be a little better.  They sound kinda like cartoon versions of real engines and they're always freaking redlining.  It gets old.  -Not a lot of customization available for cars-not a whole lot of cars (like 7)-No NPCs.  (good and bad. nobody to bother you but also nobody to race or drift with)-Challenges can be very difficult.-Automatic transmission is garbage.  Im not saying that because Im a manual douchelord. No, I tried it.  I gave it a chance and theres no way you can drift with it.  You have to play manual.  IF you dont know how to play manual this could be a big negative.Overall, I got my money's worth out of this game.  Even if I would have payed full price I would have been satisfied.  It's worth a buy. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A simple concept beautifully exectued. Casual and relaxing but also competetive if you're in that mood. The minimalistic graphics and relaxing music creates a very likeable atmosphere (Mirror's Edge comes to mind). The controls are fluid and the physics surprisingly good, which makes the game challenging but also rewarding when you nail a run. There are some annoying bugs, but nothing major. The sound goes wonky sometimes but a restart of the event fixes it and for some reason the car is in reverse at the start of a race occasionally.""Story mode"" is very brief and contains tutorials for the different race modes and simple missions. Missions are repetitive (spin here, do donuts around that, drift through here) and you'll spend a lot of time driving around trying to find the last ones to unlock the next area. I wouldn't recommend this game for the price if you're just going to play through the free roam mode as the content just isn't there. But if you enjoy perfecting your skills there's a lot of replay value and leaderboards to climb. There are three modes: track, mountain pass and gymkhana and quite a few locations for each.Unfortunatley there seems like some cheating or exploiting exists as some high scores on certain tracks are outright impossible to achieve (I've seen scores ten times higher than second place) but unless you're able to score in the top 3 or so this won't affect you much.Still, overall a very enjoyable and well executed game. I hope to see more from the developer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Absolute Drift is butter on toast.. Smooth afDriving is similar to the early top down GTA games, in that the camera doesn't sit behind the car so steering becomes inverted at times. The cars themselves, handle as if fine tuned to float like sand bags on an ice rink.It's a little like the 'Skate' games in that you'll be finding areas of the free roam map and then sessioning that area, only instead of a curb or a rail it's a docking crane and a lamp post.The ""5 Worlds"" are pretty big, each with a couple dozen drifting challanges (tricks highlighted in red) that need to be completed for the bridge to the next zone to drop. Once all zones are connected they form a rather epic playground, diverse and beautifuly crafted. There is no loading between zones so free roam is exactly that.The ""Events""  are Driftkhana, Drifting, & Mountain Drifting (foremost being a timed freestyle session, the others being un-timed single/3 lap trials respectively). All masterfully crafted, resonating a 'hitman GO' kind of ambience.There are another two dozen of these, and I found everyone of them enjoyable.The Events, were rather challanging while the free roam challanges known as ""Missions"", were far too forgiving. You could half complete a spin twice and it would register as succesfull, for example.The Soundtrack is exceptional and worth the price of admission alone. I'm not being facetious, growing up in an era where albums sold for £15/$25 I would have happily dropped a tenner on this score. The music is perfect, sliding through a ceramic China town to C41 - On my way, everything just comes together. Worth noting that while the game isn't in a pre release state the devs are still actively pushing out content and patches, the creator has said this game was a labor of love, and it shows.9/10Could use more content and maybe a way to save and share footage. But what is there is a masterpiece in top down drifting and game design.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Inspired by Ken Block’s Gymkhana series the best way to describe the game is the driving view point of micro machines, the score system of the trick sections in Project Gotham racing, the progression system of an N64 era platform game and a fantastic drift system that takes an age to master but always makes you feel it is your fault if you screw up.The game sees you progress through a number of worlds that act as the hub to complete missions. These range from performing stunts around obstacles to performing on tracks to gain points and get a world ranking.There are 3 types of events Driftkhana, Drifting, & Mountain Drifting but all are essentially a playground to gain as many points as possible. Controlled best with a gamepad the game takes about 5 minutes to understand, 10 minutes to become competent and even after several hours of game play I still did not feel I had truly mastered it.Visually the game is minimalistic but lovely to look at and run at a solid 60fps. The music soundtrack is also filled with tranquil base numbers.Now the game is not perfect. Relatively short I finished everything in a few hours and while trying to get higher up the league tables offers the game some replayability I feel that this will not be for everyone. I also felt that a more detailed tutorial to give tips on how to perfect drifting at the start as it took a lot of crashing into walls to really get the difference between how brake and handbrake acts.I enjoyed the game a lot and for the low price of £9.99 of your regional equivalent it is hard to not recommend but this isn’t a game which you will be playing for ages unless you really are a score attack gamer.Check out our video review here http://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/game-tutor-grades/150731_game-tutor-grades-absolute-drift ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simple idea, done well. Pleasing physics and an easy-to-learn, hard-to-master gameplay style. Reminds of those old Micro Machines games on PS1.Remember how in GRID if you bump the wall you lost your entire combo? Not here. You just bank what you've accumulated so far but lose your multiplier.Mirror's edge color scheme is always nice, although the music isn't as atmospheric. Car sounds are suprisingly well made, with boost dumps every time you let off the gas, and the satisfying sound of the gears whining.Made it to World 2 in my pink hachi-roku and loving it so far, although £8.99 is quite steep.

												This is an excellent, laid back game about drifting through life with a chill soundtrack in the background and some really interesting physics-based gameplay in the foreground. Keep in mind that mastering control of your car through a drift is the primary gameplay loop here, so if you simply can't stand ice levels this is probably not the game for you. If you can get past that, though, there's a beautiful open-ish world (segmented off by challenges) with a wealth of things to drift around, through, in and over - as well as special levels that challenge you to drift through a course, or score as high as possible in an arena with a time limit. There's even a lighthouse named Donut!

A Screenshot of Absolute Drift

At this point, the game's even taken its special anti-nausea edibles - so if you were put off by the camera in older Let's Plays (particularly during spins), give it another shot. One thing I would like to see is a bit more interactivity throughout the open world - sure, there's challenges you can accomplish and ramps you can jump off of and stacks of blocks you can knock down, but there's not much you can do to change the layout of the levels; it would be neat if you could (for instance) trigger a crane to raise a wall by doing a donut around a lever, or create a ramp by knocking over some of its supports. That sort of thing would be really cool, but it would just be an enhancement on an already great game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably the best drifting game on Steam right now, this little one man made indie will bring back the time where you thought you were good at Race Driver GRiD. Easy to learn, hard to master, a simple but very complete drifting game with a good variety of events (various race tracks, a free roam map, some Gymkhana) that will make you cry when you see the leaderboards after a ""great"" run.The mechanics and physics are very good and, even though I tend not to use them that much, a few cars with subtile control differences are also available with a couple of customisation. Nothing too fancy though, just a color swap and some very basic skins.The music is pretty good too, with interesting and quite fitted electro from artists Nyte and C41.If you like scoring based driving games with well done drifting mechanics, you're here for a treat.Well done Funselektor Labs Inc.

Absolute has a really simplistic ""indie"" art style with a very Mirrors Edge color scheme, that just works and looks beautiful! For me this game filled a hole for a drifting game after Rockstar ruined GTA5's driving mechanics and didn't allow for drifting of any kind.Pros:- Best soundtrack in an indie game since Minecraft- Best driving mechanics in any PC game EVER- Realistic and awesome vehicle sounds and crash sounds- Beautiful art style and color scheme- Global leaderboards make for endless replayability!- Good variety of vehicles, from a classic 180SX (missile) to the powerful WRX Wagon (hooniwagon)- 5 worlds full of fun ""missions"" as well as a helpful tutorialCons:- Only 5 worlds, even though they are all quite large, I would like to see more added. I would pay $10 for a DLC pack with 5 more worlds.- Scoring mechanics are kinda iffy, often destroying your built-up multiplyer even when you are constantly drifting or just because you barely tap a wall.9.5/10, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! For only CAD$12, how can you go wrong with a game like this?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly, there is little reason you shouldn't have this game in your library. Initially I bought this game to fill short amounts of time in between other games or to take on the go with me, but in the end I find myself playing this game more than any others in my library. PROS -Able to play for short or long amounts of time without feeling repetitive-Steep learning curve, but ridiculously fun once you get a hold of it-Options for manual and automatic transmission -Simplistic, yet beautiful art style-Easy to run on the most potato of computers (I can run it on my 1.7 ghz travel laptop for reference)-Decent soundtrack but amazing to turn off the music and jam to anything you want CONS -Terrible keyboard controls, in my opinion, so I recommend a controller-Needs a little more customization-Pricey at 12$ but if you have money burning a hole in your wallet, just buy it-NO EUROBEAT seriously like wtfIn conclusion, a must have for the Racing (or any other, for that matter) demographic			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Full grown man playing with hotwheels on the kitchen floor: the game""I mean this as an enormous compliment. I'm only a couple hours deep, but this game really wears its heart on its sleeve. If you've ever played any top-down racers or classic grand theft auto, you'll understand the controls immediately, and they feel good.Now, the point of this game is stressed explicitly several times, it's not about speed. It's about control. Your performance is scored by how well you can control your drift down a straight away and through turns. The concepts and controls are very simple, and the early levels are very welcoming to new players. That being said, the skill ceiling is actually quite high. This is definitely a game of skill. If challenge doesn't interest you, or if you've been beating your head againt the wall on a difficult course, there is a free mode that lets you loose in a sandbox with ramps and obstacles to play with. This is the section that I liken to playing with hot wheels on the kitchen floor (it's exactly as fun as it sounds).I would say this game definitely has an appeal to people that enjoy high-skill game play that has a rapid loop of retrying until you get it perfect (ex: Trials, Hotline Miami, OlliOlli, Dark Souls)I just compared playing with Hot Wheels cars on the kitchen floor to Dark Souls.....

												Nice game, with good minimalist graphics. Finished in less than 2 hrs, the rest was farming cards (thanks Idle Master!).EDIT (Aug 16th) - After the Zen Edition update, challenges were added to the events which will extend the playtime beyond the initial 2hrs of the Free Roam mode.

												Absolute Drift is an interesting top down car game, that focuses much more on drifting and the control of the car, rather than racing. You'll be doing your best to drift around corners, doing donuts, and fish tails in order to score as much points and to accomplish as much tasks as possible.

			Absolute Drift: Impressions (Drift driving adventure game, indie, gameplay, and review) Absolute Drift is an interesting top down driving indie game, that focuses on drifting more than racing.		

Once in the game you'll be thrown into a somewhat open world where you'll be doing various tasks, such as ramp jumping, donuts, fish tails, and other drifting and driving challenges. Once the section of the map's tasks are complete, it'll open up new areas of the game. While exploring this semi-open world, you'll also be given the opportunity to enter one of it's many mini-missions where you'll be aiming for high scores on the leader board. The game also features multiple car models, and colour and pattern customization as well.The biggest hurdle to Absolute Drift is it's learning curve. It's not an easy game to master and make little concession to beginning or even intermediate players. The controls are difficult at first, as the car feel very differnt from other driving games, and the ground feels something like ice. Spinning out and losing control of your car will probably be your first 30 minutes or more of your experiance. This might prove frustrating to players who don't play a lot of driving games (like me) but when you start to get the hang of things, and the small amounts of progress that you make in your driving ability really does feel rewarding. How ever, if you are a fan of driving games, it's focus on high teir play may very well be an attraction to you. The game also looks great, as it's polished and clean look catches the eye, with it's minimalist design, with great music that suit the game's look and feel. Infact, the game's OST was one of the main motavators to push through the initial frustration of the controls. I just wanted to keep playing so I could keep listening to the amazing sound track.Overall, Absolute Drift is an interesting car game that I mostly enjoyed. I loved the presentation, I love the music, I love the concept. The only thing holding me back from enjoying the game to it's full potential is my sucky driving in combination with the game's extremly high learning curve.Pros- Great visuals- Amazing sound track- An interesting concept- High teir driving fans would probably love the challenge levelCons- Extremely high learning curve- Frustrating at times			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Before we begin, let me first clarify my play time. At most I could say I got about 15 minutes of amusement before I became dreadfully bored. In the end, I was obsessed with completing a perfect game. Additionally my desire for achievement hunting came only after a 3hr idle for cards.**EDIT**Just happened to notice that I no longer have a perfect game thanks to an update...Luckily enough time has passed that I feel no urge what so ever to return and reclaim my perfect game. Further proof this game as little to offer. And before you post - Yes! I am a little salty because they stole my perfect game >.< **END EDIT**I'll condense the rest of my review to just the cons as you can read positive review for the pros.Problems:Aside from the repetitive ""challenges"" the game has no real focus other than drifting and comparing you score to other players. I guess that wouldn't be such a bad thing, especially if that is all you want, but for me I like interactive game play that goes further than a global score board.Lastly I want to say that I am not a fan of the drift mechanics. Now I am not saying I am any form of an expert on how drifting truly works, but I can state that for some reason I didn't find the drifting in this game fun. They're O.K. - just not for me. It felt like I had to learn a whole new set of drifting rules for a game I am never going to play again.Provisos:I would change my recommendation for the following type of gamer/situation;Perfectionist - Achievements were easy to get. (EDIT: Recent change/update stole my Completion)HUGE fan of any form of drifting - Drifting is in the title after all.Fan of Indie Games - For an indie game, it is not that bad.Massive sale - Anything $3 or under.

												This game is a masterpiece.Takes a bit of getting used to...Try Manual Transmission... First Couple Drift Tracks can be done on 3~4 gear...+Controls are smooth, almost perfect (with controller).        However, from what I hear, there'll be some slight changes soon, nothing too drastic. (Unity 5 PhysX)+Game has you ""preview"" new mechanics you'll have to learn to continue in the game.+Attention to detail        The developer put a ton of effort into pretty much everything and is still tweaking the game.Not the fast-paced or realistic type of racing... It's that Minimal Initial-D/Ridge Racer in-between that you can enjoy.Just try it and don't expect to pull off cool drifts at first...It's an art. You have to perfect your craft first.tl;dr versionYou can't drift like you've been chugging sake yet. Keep it slow and enjoy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Product received for free
												Drift and crash a lot No, not the game, I mean you. Absolute Drift is a game all about Drifting in a minimalist 3D world.If you like your drifting, then this is absolutely for you... (assuming you can get used to the controls first.)If your the racer type and don't really like tight corners... Then stay away from this game, it's probably not what your after then.Zen Edition adds in some additional content such as more challengers and drift stages to conquer! You will have to ofcourse wait until the official release for Zen Edition before you see any of that though... But there is loads of other stuff you can do before that time so get yourself stuck into it and get have fun!Your always stuck in the one birds eye view angle point of view so you will need to get used to that pretty quickly as well. With a little practice, you'll be soon hitting the leader boards in no time. Have fun with this one ;) Now drift your heart out, because your gonna crash, whether you like it or not! XPI would recommend you get this game on a SALE. I got this as a gift from a friend, so it was worth the look at and I enjoyed it for the most part.My score: 8.5/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very cool game. Free drive takes a little more than 2 hours to beat but then you have about 24 maps (laps, freestyle, downhill) to get your best score on and compete with friends. Some may not find it worth the 12 dollar price tag, but definitely a must buy for everyone on steam sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game features 3 level types: A-to-B mountain tracks, freestyle drift courses, and 3-lap race tracks. The free roam map has additional missions you can perform only once, such as donut around a light pole, drift between buildings, jump over a river, etc.I was pretty terrible with the drift controls for most of the game, but finally seemed to start figuring it out near the end. (The controls work just fine; I am just not very good at drifting.) Despite repeatedly crashing into walls, I really enjoyed playing this game. I enjoyed the game even more once I finally figured out how to drive and drift. I particularly loved driving around the map in free roam and discovering new missions to complete. The minimalistic art style and varied environments provides for a beautiful game that keeps you coming back for more.Pros+ Beautiful minimalistic art style+ Many missions to complete+ Large soundtrack with ability to skip tracks whenever you want+ Ramps! Launch your car into the air and spin out of control+ Customizable car body and paint jobs+ Controller supportCons- Not much replayability once you've completed all free-roam missions- Difficult learning curve for controls- Only three types of levels gives feeling of repeating the same thing over and overThe game trailer video perfectly shows a taste of what you'll experience playing this game. If the video makes you even remotely interested, then buy it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
