								It's a really cool concept, but the gameplay is just bad.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I don't know if they are still working on this game but I would not recommend this game in Early Access.The idea is nice but at the moment the game is nearly unplayable and you should better wait for more updates on this game.Could be a nice Arcadesoccergame but I think there is still a very long way to go.

								I played a round and thought this game had very interesting concepts and design. Two teams of players wearing futuristic suits face off in a soccer match with no rules, where fighting and fouls are allowed. I would strongly recommend a controller to play this game, and I feel this game has amazing potential and hope to see how it develops and grows.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Graphics are ok, and I know this is early access, but currently it's just unplayable.Often the auto player switch would DESELECT the player I needed, and yet sometimes when I pressed switch player it wouldnt do anything until after it was way too late. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I really enjoyed my time playing soccer rage, is a sort of hybrid soccer game with combat system, in which you can play soccer as you know or simply kick your rival *****. The game is still on early access, so it has limited content, I hope the developer will continue working on this.Pros:- Is really funny, most if you play with friends.- Graphics and music are ok, animations are neat and effect display correctly with low end cards- Has potential.- Very kind developer.Cons:- There is still a very long way to go, the game needs more content.- The ai need improve.- Awkward controls.

The general idea is a pretty good one! undoubtedly has potencial, but suffers from bad gameplay and repetitive boring fightsPros:- good for a time waster- nice music and ambient sounds- simple graphics that run fine on average computers- the design of the team uniforms is awesomeCons:- awkward movements and fight mechanics- dumb AI 5.5/10  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								A very good concept, good work (until now) but it has so many flaws that the gameplay is not entirely good.I'm expecting too much from the developers.You won't regret getting this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
