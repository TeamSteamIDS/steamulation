								Only 5 hours in and I'm already considering this as one of the best purchases that I've ever done. Kudos to the creator!			",18,2,0,3,0,1,0

								Bought as soon as released. Considering this is in Early Access it's a very polished game. Attention to detail is amazing, jump-floats, floats, digs, sets, it has them all. Heck even the referee gives the correct hand signals and my AI partner gave me a pat on the back for a good Spike.If you like Beach Volleyball, buy this game.If you don't like Beach Volleyball - It's high time you started. Buy the game! p.s.Unlike real BVB players these players don't get injured. Get well soon Laura Ludwig.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								if you like volleyball and want a volleyball simulation game look no further i tend to be skeptical and weary for early access games but this game was a ace right out of the gate and i can only see it getting better			",49,13,0,30,27,4,11

								This is an incredibly solid game. It's almost like you took what made DIg and Spike Volleyball great for the SNES and made it for the modren era. If youre looking for a great volleyball game this is it! Be sure to play the hell out the tutorials as they are critical in your playing the game well. Kudos to you Mr. Developer for making a great the has so much depth and getting it so right. Thank you thank you thank you!			",16,0,0,3,0,1,1

								I wanted to play this game for a few hours before leaving a review.Positives:-Not very graphic intensive, so you dont need a beast computer to play it. -Feels good when you get good kills or make nice plays-Very fun and addicting-As a former professional volleyball player, this definitely scratches the itch of wanting to play for real...lolSome negatives/improvements to consider: -The AI of your teammate is not bad, but there are movements that need to be ironed out. There are times when the ball is coming towards you and you try to pass it, but nothing happens. You expect your teammate to block at the net while you play defense, but sometimes he awkwardly stand in the middle and doesnt play defense and the ball literally goes thru his body. I'm sure that will be fixed in final release-There is a command where you can tell your teammate to either play defense or block at the net. (A button+directional).   However, during a rally, you're running around using your directional and your A button. So half the time youre telling your teammate 3 different commands and it just gets messy...especially during transition. -Some people say the menu is clunky. While it could definitely improve, I dont think its that bad...I'd rather the developer forcus more time on the gameplay and iron out the bug/glitches.-I hope down the road, add some more game modes such on multiplayer of some sorts.Overall:I recommend this game even during early access. The developer sure did put out a solid game for us to play early on. I'm really excited to see how this game develops			",5,0,0,1,5,1,0

								Needs a lot of polishing, Especially on the passing, setting, and hitting machanics. But other than polishing things up and fixing clunky systems, the game is better than I could of hoped for. It is very entertaining and fun to play! This game would be fun for people who don't even play volleyball in real life!! I am really looking forward to watching this game progress and be able to play the finished masterpiece one day!

								I took my time buying this game really, reading all the opinions and they were all right! this is by far the best volleyball on the market for sure. Gameplay is almost perfect with the comp AI mostly on a very high lvl. So far the thing that i find most ""inaccurate"" is the sound when u hit/block the ball (it doesnt sound realistic to me). But thats such a minor thing its not even worth mentioning ;)			",16,1,0,0,2,1,2

								My first review ever. Long Story short...Simple Controls, satisfying and funny gameplay, low requirements, less than 2 GB storage, adequate price, graphics ok. You can create own Players and earn experience points to increase player skills during career mode (I'm a big fan of these options).Fans of ""Fifa 17"" or similar titles may be disappointed about the simple gameplay, details or possibilities, but it's definitely worth playing. I usually don't play sport games, but i like this game.If you like Volleyball, you will like this game too. Otherwise it may not kill you to give it a try. There are much more disappointing titles in the endless space of the Steam Store...			",144,15,0,11,6,1,9

								Worth every cent to purchase. Runs smooth graphics are just fine. The AI is incredibly smart and the stat system actually matters. You can definately feel changes as your raising your stats. Very large progression throughout the seasons with National and World rankings and tournaments reflecting your current rankings.			",127,12,0,40,5,1,5
