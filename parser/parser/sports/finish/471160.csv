												This game is great, the crazy shots you can take if you get creative is amazing. You actually feel like you're standing in space. The controls feel great as well.			",418,72,6,66,31,5,49

												It's a cool concept there is just very little here. Decide for yourself if 5euro/dollar is worth 20-30m of fun.			",252,90,6,39,52,3,55

												very charming take on mini golf. Could use more content updates and some tweaks to the camera control but this is a very fun blend of mini golf and angry birds			",95,38,4,7,39,2,19

												Chet Faliszek was right: You had no idea you wanted this, but you do. It's five dollars! If you ever spent 5 dollars on miniature golf, this is the better deal. It's a new showcase game for your friends, too! It's fun to just grab a planet and spin it around (thanks to the very good haptics in this game).Is is perfect? Nope. Is it overflowing with content? Nope. But it's one of the coolest concepts the Vive has. Two thumbs up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is how God would play golf. You chuck the ball across a planet's orbit to reach a hole on the other side of the planet or floating in space on a moon or asteroid. For $5 you get 18 holes, and each one is a unique planet with various different comic obstacles. You can finish the game in under an hour, but it'll take multiple playthroughs to actually get under par. Then there's ""Pro Mode"" where you get a much smaller indicator of the ball's arc. It also comes with achievements.Check out my gameplay video:

												This is a neat little game. It has a few areas where I would like to see some aspects added, maybe a global scoreboard and multiplayer is always a plus. Aesthetically, the holes look very nice and the gameplay is really intuitive to figure out.I managed to get through both courses in about 45 minutes, granted I would need significantly more practice to reach par on even the easy course, but I hope they have one or two more courses planned and a few more nifty mechanics to keep it interesting. That said, I spent more for lunch today and I ate it faster than the time I put into this, so well worth the entertainment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Neat little game. Nice style, very simple (needs no explanation to play) and cool physics. Sure, there are other games that are ""better"" for 4 or 5 times the price but 2 maps and 2 difficulties per map for $5, this isn't a bad value.			",180,31,3,20,31,4,8

												I myself like different kind of golf games. It don't matter if it's a mini-putt game or a straight on regular golf game.This one, has a twist that I really, really love. Space. It is so rewarding to see the ball fly through space and act as expected. The sad thing is, I'm not good at golf. Brilliant game this!

												Excellent puzzle game that could not take place outside of virtual reality. Even the VR cynics I've had try this game admit it: it's a blast to play through the challenging courses in this game. It also has shades of Super Mario Galaxy, which is a pleasant trip down memory lane.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
