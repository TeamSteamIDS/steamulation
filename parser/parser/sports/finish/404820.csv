												This is a fun game to play localy. The keys are simple yet it is quite hard to combine a few normal steps together :). I myself bought the game because I have seen it in this video ->

												Dude...this game is amazing. So challenging yet so rewarding. I said it in my review below along with other points, but if you screw up your race 9/10 times, the 1 time you get it right...it just feels so great.

The only con I have is the tutorial should instead give you feedback per your step. If I press the button too early by a millisecond it ruins the continuity of learning by making me fix the mistake.The daily challenge is sweet, the levels are perfect, I would just want more events eventually!Great job!

												OMG! This game is fantastic. It's fun as hell and it has a quite nice learning curve.I do admit that this game has already made me frustrated couple of times, but in a good way... unlike QWOP.Alright; lets get to the actual game:As the title of the game says, this is most of all a running game where you have to press and release buttons with right  timing to make your athlete move properly. The game itself has various running distances for you to compete on and it also has jumping sports in it as well. Unlike in QWOP; in Ragdoll Runners you can actually move FORWARD...without FLIPS.The game has online best times list and you can compare your times with your friends on steam as well... AND...the best part: LOCAL SPLITSCREEN MULTIPLAYER (up to 4 playes I think)!!!!!! PS. no online MP [atleast atm]If you have the gamepads and you know that you have friends coming over, then on less than 5e price...THIS IS THE MUST BUY GAME !Pros:- Splitscreen multiplayer- Good learning curve- Cheap- Fun as hellCons:- Skipping work to play- Playing at work- Beating your boss on the game on worktime making him mad10/10 - Would get boss mad again			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really just got this, so I can't say much about the replayability of this game yet... But learning this game is actually a lot more fun than I expected it to be. I'm not quite there yet but there is definitely a nice feel to the physics and controls. Although it can be fun watching you crawl over the track like a baby seal the game invites you to master the skills and improve your records. Having the masterboards adds a bit to the challenge. 5 euro's is not cheap, but I think a fair price. I think this game has potential for something a bit bigger and more polished, but for now I'm enjoying it quite a bit, as I said it is more fun than I expected.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
