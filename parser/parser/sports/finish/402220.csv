YouTube™ Video: Apoch Plays w/ Dana and 'Lift It' | Humor Play (Early Access)

			NOTE: This video was initially 45 minutes long. I cut it down in hopes to at least turn a boring video into something humorous, but still gives you an idea of what playing this game is like.		

Trolling/jokes aside: This could actually be an interesting reverse RPG title. I commend the developers for doing something different, however the execution is too basic to really be fun. Everything looks the same, not to mention like it's the PlayStation 1 days once more, there's no variety in training other than mashing the up button, the battle controls seem archaic... there's just little fun to be had in such a basic title with honest-to-goodness anti-RPG ideas that genuinely seem fresh in a world of RPG Maker titles.The other big issue is the cost. Nearly $10 for this title is just too much. The comedic ""so bad"" value of the Johnny Bravo simulator is lost once you realize the island is populated by the childeren of the Sega Dreamcast's Seaman creatures, leaving you to regret such a high priced title. $4.99 US is even pushing it, but would have been a little more justifiable to the game's shortcomings...**EDIT: At some point, the price for this game dropped from $9.99 when not on sale, to $7.99. Just pointing this out, as I have no idea when it was done. I think it's still a bit too steep (I stand by my $4.99 suggestion), but it is a little more tantalizing a price point than the earlier $9-$10 ticket for admission.**			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
