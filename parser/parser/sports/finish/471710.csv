								I finally decided to leave a review of this game after seeing the AMA on Reddit, because I want to support these guys any way I can. Everything about this game makes you happy. Everyone's always smiling (because your character can only smile), other players are extremely friendly (its totally normal for people to compliment you or congratulate you if you hit them in paintball), and the devs are just as feel-good as the game itself. They are extremely responsive to the community and really have a way of making everyone feel special. I sent Against Gravity an email recently, and the response I got came back less than six hours later not from some intern, but from the CEO. And in the AMA, when someone asked how they could support the company financially, the response was to instead to make a donation to charity and to ""tell 'em coach sent ya"". They're small gestures, but it really shows that they care.In a world where it seems like we are constantly being bombarded with negativity, and where everyone is divided, this game is like a haven of positivity. Much like the reviews, the game itself is ""overwhelmingly positive""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I seriously wish more people knew about this game, I just discovered it and what a ♥♥♥♥ing laugh it is. Honestly one of the best VR titles out I believe. Please try promote this game! Post it everywhere! It's got such a little player count but It's honestly amazing! Nothing worse than an amazing FREE title with no players :( 110% One of the best VR games on the market, and you don't even have to pay for it. Please give it a shot!EDIT: (Never really explainied why it's such a good title, so here it is!) So far I have 25 minutes in it, yes it's not a huge amount of time but to leave that kind of review ^ after 25 minutes is what every dev should be aiming for.You spawn in a mini 40s tutorial just telling you some basic things, how to move and your inventory system type thing. It then tells you to proceed through the locker room door behind you. Man was I blown away, If you've ever played The Division, when you run out the first tent and you're greeted by players? It's exactly like that. One simple mechanic that I love. I walked through and had 3-4 people surround me waving etc, what a warm welcome! Bunch of lovely people playing around with basket balls n frisbees which I stayed with for a good while! I then went into Paintball to give it a try, what fun it was!! 2v2 due to small player count but god It was awesome! Wasn't in very long cause I joined near the end but I managed to capture a flag and get a sneaky kill. At the end of the game I was beyond amazed at a parcel floating infront of me, to find out this game has UNLOCKABLES! The one thing EVERYONE looks for in a game is a goal, and this game has it!! Never been so happy to come across a title in the store in all my life, and thank god I tried it. I certainly won't be leaving this game anytime soon. See you all in there :)			",68,6,9,3,12,1,3

Get this game and you will not regret it.  This is what VR is good at.  I have never felt more like I was actually socializing over the internet than before...that might sound sad, but it is really frickin awesome.I want to add that the dev are hard at work on this game!

								I'll put it simply - RecRoom Paintball is the best online multiplayer game that I've ever played in my entire life (and I am 40 y.o. game addict). I played it already for 400 hours, and I keep coming back every day. I would pay for it even a couple of houndred dolars if I had to. Honestly, for that amount of fun it would be worth, without doubt. So, grab and enjoy it when it's still free!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Recreational activities in virtual reality... a very simple concept, that is much more fun than you might expect! Controls:The controls in Rec Room are very simple and intuitive. Touchpad = Teleport, Trigger = Grab, Menu Button = Menu. That's literally all that you need to know to play this game! Graphics/Animation:The graphics in this game are very cartoonish and simple, But that is NOT a bad thing. The game is very polished and detailed and contains everything you would want from a VR title. The animations in this game are wonderful! They were very well thought out and designed. Everything moves around smoothly, and there are lots of little details that make this game great!Physics:The physics are great, until they are not, but when they are not, there were not supposed to be. All of the games physics work perfectly and smoothly, except for the darts. That's where things get fun. In the main lobby, throwing darts onto objects causes some weird things to occur such as making the object float, or spin. This is all apart of the fun though! The few physics that don't work, don't need to work, and if they did, the game just wouldn't be the same. Multiplayer: This is the main feature of the game, and it is portrayed PERFECTLY! All the small aspects of this game is what makes it so great! Want to join a party with someone? Give them a fist bump! Don't want anyone to hear you sneeze in real life? Put your in-game hand over your mouth to mute your mic! Genius! Most people that play this game tend to be pretty nice. Remember though, this is still the internet, you WILL run into some pretty impolite, no mannered, idiots occasionally. Prepare for explicit language and sexual content. If someone can say it/do it, you can hear it/see it.Customization:You can make your Rec Room avatar look any way that you want it to! There are many different items and accessories including; Shirts, wristbands, glasses, hair bands/bows, gloves, sweatbands, and more! Lots of hair style options are available, and you can change them to any (Natural) hair color. Skin color is also an option!The settings page lets you change just about everything to make the game perfect for you! Resolution too low? Turn it up! Someone talking about something you don't want to hear, or even screaming in their mic? Mute them. Simple. There are TONS of options for voice chat. This even includes a voice changer! Three different options are included for when you want people to hear you. Always On, Push-To-Talk (Grip Button to activate), and Off. Graphics and mic customization are just a few of the settings Rec Room has to offer, so play around with them until they work for you!Games:6 games are currently available to play in Rec Room; Dodgeball, PaintBall, 3D Charades, Disc Golf, Soccer, and Paddle Ball. All of which, are not only as fun as the real thing, but as REAL as the real thing. Each game is totally unique and fun in its own way! None of these games can be played by yourself (while still having fun), they all need two or more people to really complete the experience. (They are multiplayer games in real life after all.) All 6 games allow you to use your mic to communicate with each other. Whether your joking around and having a good time in 3D Charades, or Talking with your team and strategically planning your next Paintball round! Make sure you try out all of the different games, as they are all very fun, unique, and competitive (If you want it to be!).Tips and Tricks:1. You can reorientate your room by squeezing the grip button on both controllers!2. While holding an object with the trigger, you can press the top menu button to lock it in place. Now you no longer have to hold the trigger down! Rec Room is updated almost weekly with new features! It's a free application, which honestly feels like I am scamming the developers of their time and money! Please download this game right now, you waisted time reading this review when you could have been playing the game already! :)9.5/10EDIT: After 50 hours of playtime, I have to change my rating...10/10			",32,24,4,0,25,4,2

								I'm really surprised. I never thought a FREE Virtual Reality game would be one of my favorites! It says it's in early access, however it is more polished and have dramatically more content than most paid VR games. The way you can meet and interact with people is amazing in a huge locker room with tons of things to do. This game also includes 5 different minigames; Dodgeball, Paddle Ball, Disc Golf and my personal favorites 3D Charades and Paint Ball. I think my best virtual reality experiences comes from this game. The community is awesome, keeping this game alive. If there was one thing I did not like about this game... is the servers. There is a noticeable delay in everything you do and interact with people. For example: Throwing a ball feels off, table tennis is difficult due to the ball ""lagging"" ect. If the developers manage to fix this, this might be the best multiplayer virtual reality experience.If I were to give this game an IGN rating it would be, 9/10 Too much fun. -CyberHaxerUPDATE: The game has improved a lot since I wrote this review. Tons of new content and ways to have fun. Level system is pretty awesome and rewarding boxes with costume pieces after leveling up/playing games. Graphical upgrades and new maps and updated maps makes the game shine more than ever before! Not to mention, servers has been improved by miles! This game is THE BEST VR EXPERIENCE I've ever had. It deserves a 10/10 from what it is!			",127,15,7,7,23,2,6

This game is worth the price of owning a Vive.All by itself. And considering that it's nominally a bunch of toys, that's saying something.What makes this game awesome is the community. You step out of your ""dorm room"" (starting area) and you find yourself in this open space with a bunch of other real people chatting, goofing off, and generally just having a good time. As a bit of a socially awkward nerd, that same ""twang"" of anxiety I get when walking into a new space with a bunch of strangers? That happened here.Except there were no real people. They were all pixels on my Vive's screen.Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's the future!The games are well executed and are a lot of damn fun. VR Charades (performed with a 3d painting tool) alone will cause giggles, let alone the playing around in the common area. Developers are often online, playing games with people, chatting, and generally just having a good time. The Paintball game is probably the single best shooter on Steam as I write this, and there's plenty of other fun stuff too.It's free. If you own a Vive, drop what you're doing, make sure your hand controllers are charged, and download this NOW.			",212,37,2,23,26,5,38

								Turns out I suck as much at VR sports as I do real life sports. Maybe more.I recommend a fair amount of room to play this game in. I'd back up to the back of my space in dodge ball and still end up hitting things when I whipped it as hard as I needed to to make it go anywhere.Somehow my racket broke (I mean literally broke, the handle fell off and I couldn't pick it up off the floor and I don't even know why this happened) in paddle ball, but the guy I was playing with was cool about it and just dropped his and we played with our hands.It's a load of fun, but damn, if you're self conscious about how uncoordinated you are, this won't do you any favors.

								Rec Room is one of my favorite titles for the Vive.  There are always plenty of online friends to start a game with.  The controls are extremely easy to master and because there's so much to do, the replay factor is extremely high. Paintball is my favorite mini game by far, but one of the coolest aspects of the game is the lobby, where you can hit a speed bag, shoot some hoops, play darts or just mess around.   Definitely a must-have for Vive owners.			",68,26,5,1,19,8,4

								Probably my favorite VR game currently. As of right now, the community is nice, and its really fun to play. Hope to see more activities in the future.EDIT: The developers have been pushing out major updates incredibly frequently so far, introducing two new activities since launch and a few other changes. The game seems to be getting better by the week and the community is still just as nice and friendly as ever.			",147,19,4,15,15,3,7

								This game is Amazing and it just keeps getting better the developers actually listen and improve the game regularly. The community is friendly and it feel just like hanging out with your friends. all the games are addictive and very playable my favorite is Paintball but disc golf is also up their. Do you need to own this game? If you have a VIVE then the answer is Yes is the best game out there.  ",60,23,1,0,14,3,1

								GEnuinely the most fun I've had so far in VR. The graphics are simple and cheerful but colourful and bright enough to overcome the Vive's screen door issues and, within minutes, you are totally immersed.My first adventure was just pratting around in the Rec Room lobby - a social club with various physical items you can throw around, a couple of games to play and the avatar design room (as of July 2016 - I preferred the old system as the new one calls for a little too much walking and turning to select items).After a little time meeting new people and chatting I tried out some of the minigames. During one, I turned round after hearing my name, and my friend was standing spectating me. Formed a party and then off to play the brilliant (but too short) Frisbee Golf , followed by the also fantastic 3D Charades. My high point was in 3D charades where, in order to describe James Bond, I drew the opening credits iris and then used my avatar to walk into the centre and turn and shoot just like Bond. They got it eventually but it really made me feel that this was a game where anything goes and you can do pretty much as you please.The latest addition, Paintball, is hands down the most fun I've had in VR, the most action adn teh best multiplayer.Sneaking up to the opponent's flag base and then leaning through the windows and round corners to clear the way before a flag steal is just amazing. For a £20 game I would be impressed. For a FREE game, I'm beyond stunned. Rec Room deserves to be a huge success as it's truly fantastic and a must have for any VR owner.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Consider for a moment how life was before celluar phones and broadband internet, if you wanted to do something with others, you would generally find yourself slumming it at the local recreation center. That's what this game brings you back to, spending time with strangers doing social things. And this way you don't have to worry about seeing that old guy naked in the locker rooms, or wonder if you might get kidnapped by that creepy guy with the trenchcoat. Not to mention the wide variety of games for everyone: Charades for those times when your word is Robin Hood, and everyone in the room keeps guessing a camel because you're awful at drawing; Paintball, for all those times you wanted to know how poorly you'd do in a real fps; Ping Pong, because it wasn't frustrating enough in real life so now you get to chase a ping pong ball accross two floors; Dodgeball, so you can experience what it was like to be the fat kid during PE. Now the servers don't seem to have the greatest connection sometimes people's voices might lag, or they'll slowly start to drift off into the sky, but this is the new generation of chat rooms, and it looks... very positive. With vr you get this extra level of communication, though rudimentary, there's real body language being transmitted, and that's honestly very cool with such a positive community in this currently. This is the Wii sports of VR, as in, this game by itself, makes your purchase feel worth it.			",205,47,2,28,19,3,25

								Great game!   Very social and fun.   I have one suggestion though.   I thought the 3D charades was really fun at first but then after 1.5 hours I realized that the words started repeating CONSTANTLY.  Pretty soon it became fairly easy to draw and guess other people's drawing because you are already familiar with all the words.   The word list they use must be really short.   I strongly suggest the developers increase the word list so that the game can be fun for more than 2 hours.			",17,21,4,1,12,1,2

								I tried the game, got familiar with it and then I had a glorious idea.There was a table, so I aligned my couch, sat down, back turned to approaching people. Then I wanted to uhm calibrate my controllers by making a fist and swinging a bit in like.. let's say belly area. Let's face it, it's mandatory.After one or two dudes came by, seeing my back, then my front and thus inducing some laughter, a seemingly funny nice guy sat down beside me, joining my joke.So me, my cone and my new friend who offered to give me a hand sat there, laughing, blowing, giving me a hand as mentioned. I got myself a video camera trying to film ourselves, but I couldn't manage to get a nice take. (Selfie Stick DLC 5€?)Nevertheless, after some time I took a look at his profile, turns out he's gay. My girlfriend laughed at me, cause I had pseudo-gay-vr-cybersex. Talk about future.10/10Sidenote:You're a genuinly nice guy, I'd be happy to see the videos you took. I miss you.

								Fun to hang out with friends and make new friends. Puts your VR abilities to the test.One other thing that is put to the test when in this game, that is your nerves :).I have been in and out of the recroom for weeks now, all has been great until my lastvisit. Be warned that this game being public and free that language and vulgarity canbe present. I was online with a friend recently and we could not detect where or whoit was from. Hopefully some type of control of this type of behavior takes place.Main defense for now is turn off the sound and quickly get into a game instance.Should the sexual vulgarity and language continue, I know of 3 gamers that willmove on. The game is great, would be ashamed if it turns out to be a new placefor perves. I do need to add that there is an option in place to vote a boot of anabusive player. The issue was that when there are so many players in the lockerroom that it is hard to find out where or who the abuser is.			",31,13,1,2,16,3,1

								PAINTBALL! We all know and love it. This is a great VR representation of the sport. I really find it hard to believe this is free!It's a real workout: kneeling, squatting, dodging, peeking around corners, and keeping your arms raised through it all  There are two main playstyles I see for it so far:The more skilled/seasoned players tend to just teleport as rapidly as possible while shooting very accurately. Sort of abusing the teleport mechanic because it's really hard to keep track of much less hit them; you'll be flanked often. This works because the average skill level of players is very low. I just think the game is so new and the market is so small still. If everyone understood what was happening you wouldn't be able to play that way anymoreThe other playstyle is like the real sport. It's how I think the devs mean the game to be played. Using trees, every piece of cover, even the grass. Movement matters more. Putting paint down range and pinning players or covering friendlies is more important. It sets up team play and makes it feel like you are actually engaged. It's SO FUN!And the cost of gear is close to the real sport. They really ticked all the boxes on this one haha :]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I don't think I've laughed so hard while gaming in quite a while. Great Wii Sports flavour and it just brings out the inner sense of fun in everybody. Exciting to run into the Devs!The in-game camera is outstanding.			",185,22,7,12,28,6,8

								This game could be utter trash and I would still recommend it mainly due to the game itself only being part of the experience. Some people say that paintball is the best part, some would think charades; I feel like the community is the best part. I've played with 4 year olds and 24 year olds and the game doesn't change, everyone is so nice and wonderful. There's no bullying, there's no harassment, just genuine fun. I spend a lot of my time playing charades and hanging out in the locker room and there's just something about chilling out and having fun with other players that immerses me into the game a lot more than any other VR title I own. Easily a 10/10, and it's free!Just be careful playing charades at 4:00 AM, it gets dirty ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)			",219,23,12,14,17,3,11

								Rec Room has been one of my top 3 games to play in VR ever since I got my HTC Vive!  For the price, you get a heft amount of content plus I love the incentives you have for coming back such as the allure of new items.  I noticed the locker room area also has some renovations coming soon so it's nice to see the devs adding more content.  The basic gist of the game is that you have a few main areas: Your dorm room is where you customize your character and just fool around getting used to the controls and such.  The locker room is the lobby of sorts where people from around the world congregate and fool around with basketballs, frisbees, darts, ping pong, punching dummies, dodgeballs, boomboxes, etc.  You can talk to people if you like and it's nice to see features such as being able to mute yourself and others just in case things get a bit annoying.  The other areas are the main meat of the game which are the Rec Room activities.  You've got various things to choose from: dodgeball, disc golf, 3D charades, paintball, shield soccer, and paddle ball.  My favorite activities to play are dodgeball and paintball, they are both great for a workout because of all the dodging and ducking you'll be doing!  The games themselves, from what I've seen, typically have very friendly and fun people playing them so there's no need to feel socially anxious about joining a game with strangers.  There is one last area which was recently added and it's a private lounge which you can relax in alone or you can invite friends and other players.  Inside the private lounge, you'll find a dart board, ping pong table, dice, a card table, a boombox, a conference room complete with whiteboards, and a 3D charades stage.All in all, this is one of the best examples I've played as far as AAA virtual reality games are concerned because the polish and attention to detail is high with Rec Room and the replay value is very high especially due to the social aspect of it since it's online.  If you have a VR headset, Rec Room needs to be in your library!Checkout my playthrough of a couple Rec Room games!

								This is by far the best experience I have had on the Vive. I'm not usually one for role-play games where you have to make your own fun, but this game was an absolute blast. The controls, while a lot to get used to, are surpringly fluid and intuitive. The models are incredibly buggy, but frankly that just makes the experience that much more fun, since it gives every one in your room something to laugh at or talk about. The games themselves are actually pretty fun as well (minus dodgeball, which is clearly lacking). All in all, I would absolutely recommend giving this game a shot. Props to the devs and keep it up!

								Rec Room is important.VR is an important thing.  Those who are excited about it all have to become used to defending it.“Oh, it’s too expensive”“Oh, it’s a gimmick”Let’s answer those concerns.This game is free to play.  Spend 30 minutes in it.  It costs you nothing.  I recommend 3d charades.  Paintball seems the most popular, but there’s something special I think about 3d charades.  This game is the one that pushes every boundary, while taking every risk (it’s free folks).			",103,32,1,17,10,1,24

								Edit: This game just keeps getting better! Since I wrote my review there has been many quality of life patches and even a new game added! The newly added Quest mode is quite amazing. The devs have outdone themselves once again, now including one of the best Dungeon crawls at the moment for VR and the only one as far as I'm aware that includes co-op. The update also brought tons of new clothes and accessories!/editDefinitely one of the most polished and fun multiplayer games on the Vive right now. To think that it's free too!The paintball mode currently is one of, if not the most, fun shooters at the moment.Honestly the rest of the modes are either not very fun or not played at all but that's fine by me.It's neat playing with people from around the world, the game does a good job at making player interaction immersive. For the most part the community is civil too which is nice.			",657,212,8,100,43,5,63

								Lot's of content for a free to play.Paintball is not good. Obsticle models are oversized and players just exploit teleporting to the MAX. I am not sure how to address this issue in VR but I can say that this developer got it wrong... Map scale does not correlate well with gun play mechanics and neither does teleporting to team spawns and setting up a tent.I would recommend only becuase its free. But hey lets be honest if the mini games were solid we would probably have to pay 35.99$ to experience a lower level of dissapointment...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This was my first multiplayer experience, within minutes i had changed my outfit and got chatting to people within the lobby mature friendly people who were good for a laugh, we went through the games and played together before getting some 3 vs 3 going in the dodgeball with people dropping in and out. I now have friends who have VR and am looking forward to more multiplayer experiences.There are some minor bugs such as the camcorder disappearing when you drop it sometimes, the balls in dodgeball disappearing and im not sure what caused them to vanish. I believe going back to the lobby fixes that.The game itself is super intuitive, if you find another player and you guys want to hang out as a party you can either go through the menu or bro fist each other which is a great touch!

								Lot's of content for a free to play.Paintball is not good. Obsticle models are oversized and players just exploit teleporting to the MAX. I am not sure how to address this issue in VR but I can say that this developer got it wrong... Map scale does not correlate well with gun play mechanics and neither does teleporting to team spawns and setting up a tent.I would recommend only becuase its free. But hey lets be honest if the mini games were solid we would probably have to pay 35.99$ to experience a lower level of dissapointment...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is definitely one of the most fun games out right now for VR, especially considering the price (free). That helps bring in more people, and the lobby and games are so much more fun when there are people around.You can put buckets on people's heads, throw darts at them and have them running around with a dart in the back of their head, play ping pong, and the set games are pretty fun. There is work that needs to be done, but the game mostly works as intended. Recommended for everyone to try.			",170,56,5,11,28,6,25

This is as social a game that you can get (ignoring something like Pokemon GO, which just fools you into going outside).I can't believe this is free.  Just the little starting area where you can toy around with basketballs, customize your character, and hang out with people is fantastic.  Then you have things like dodgeball, disc gofl, and their new beast of a paintball game!  Seriously, if you have a Vive, download this just for the paintball.  As of this moment, it's better than Battle Dome.Lots of updates, great polish, and it's free!  Absolutely no reason to not try it out if you have a Vive!			",246,29,10,19,25,4,7

								I'm not a social gamer, so when RecRoom was mentioned positively on reddit I took my time before trying it.It's been a great experience. With the always on mic(by default), friendly enviroment, active player base, and cartoony avatars I find it really easy and fun to interact with other players using speech, as well as various body and hand gestures.The bulk of RecRoom is made up by it's minigames.. things like the ever so popular Paintball and Charades. The social part just acts as a fun multipler in most cases.Be advised that there is an age limit, though you'll likely to see kids under that age limit regularly (just because the content is very apealing and accessable to all age ranges). But be aware that people will likely ""sexual harrass"" you, though really it's all in good humor. I've yet to have any negative social experience in this game.I have had the HTC Vive since the start. As of now RecRoom has taken the honor of being my most played VR game. Increases my level, abilities in games, getting a solid carido workout in, and finding new cosmetic items all keep me coming back for more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Firstly, I want to say I love VR everytime I take off the headset now I expect to run into one of my walls with the chaperone thing showing my boundaries xDBut onto the review, this game is amazing, the community for now is nice because it's a small playerbase, but thats most likely because it's new, I guarantee there will be hundreds of people playing this because it's basically what everyones wanted, a place where they can interact with other people who have a Vive, the only thing relatively close to this is Hover Junkers, and thats simply because it has multiplayer, did I mention this is free? well yea it's free WHICH IS A GOOD THING again I'm comparing this to Hover Junkers, but let's say you Just bought your $800($900 with shipping) and you want to just relax and talk to people, the only game that does that before this one came out was Hover Junkers, and it has a $35 price tag, no one want's to spend another $35 when they just spent $900, that is what's going to make this game popular, it's free, and it's a social game, now I'm not a person to review things in detail but this game deserves it, I recommend this to anyone with a Vive, or if your planning on getting one.

								A few par-for-the-course early access bugs notwithstanding, this is an impressively polished and super fun social VR title! The environments, soundtrack, and the aesthetic of the avatars all set a playful and welcoming tone. Fist bumping to party up with others is charmingly intuitive, and who doesn't love high fives with confetti?! The integration of equipable video cameras is a clever addition to a social space like this, adding another way to interact beyond playing the game modes proper or tossing around toys.Of the games currently included, my favorite is paddle ball. It's ridiculously fun getting into a heated one-on-one volley exchange. Make sure you're secure with your chaperone and have cleared plenty of space for exuberant swinging, as the matches do get intense!The only issues I've encountered so far have been a bit of judder in the lobby occasionally, and some minor glitchy behavior related to avatar customization. The sports themselves run remarkably solid though, with no noticeable lag or major physics weirdness. Voice chat is clear and loud, perhaps working *too* well with more boisterous chatters in the area, but individuals can thankfully be muted. Teleportation is nicely implemented, with an aiming arch and helpful preview of your avatar's warp location.If you have a Vive, don't hesitate to give this one a go. At its current price of FREE you are getting an incredible value. I'd have unquestionably thrown some cash towards this, and still would as it becomes more robust with time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Rec Room is still my go to VR game... specifically paintball.  It is for me, the most fun I've had in VR yet.  It's the game I play almost every day.  Yes, there are only two maps. When you get a few good players in a match it doesn't matter - the magic happens!  Maybe it's the teleport mechanic that makes it so interesting.  You have to be very quick and time things just right - teleport behind people, that sort of thing.  It's works for me but as all things VR go - YMMV.It's free, which honestly I still can't believe.  Honestly Devs - I don't know if you are taking donations but I feel guilty with all the time I've spent playing.  I'd be happy to contribute a few duckets to the cause!   I've only scratched the surface of the other games so I can't really speak to them.  The small amount of poking around them was fun though.  If you have a VR headset you should at least give this one a whirl- IT IS FREE.			",126,46,4,11,16,3,23

								One of the best (free) multiplayer VR games out there. I personally like paintball most. It is a pleasure to shoot fellow players and hear their responses right after i have shot them. Sometimes we do high fives or just wave afterwards. Charades and locker room are great to socialise with other players. I want to give my thanks to the developers. Recommended!			",38,23,1,1,21,1,1

								First of all, I think Rec Room deserves a nomination in the current STEAM AWARDS!I have nominated Rec Room for the WHOAAAA, DUDE! Award.This is why:The social aspect of Rec Room is beyond belief, so many games I've played have been terrorized by socially challenged and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ players, the so called ""Toxic"" player communities. In Rec Room, this is completely different.The ability to talk, have a chat and interact with the playerbase is awesome and I think it's all because of the way you made this game: Positive!This whole game shows positivity all around, it's all fun and games, party and laugh. The player base copies that positivity and it shows, I have yet to meet another ""Troll"" in Rec Room.The fact that this game is free I think deserves and award, I would totally pay to play this, but I don't have to!Keep up the good work!I honestly hope Rec Room will receive an award, even though unlikely comparing the playerbase of VR to the normal games, but here's one vote from me anyway!

								Easily some of the most fun I've had in VR.Rec Room is a wonderful social experience where you can meet people from all over the world, group up, and play games together.  3D Charades, messing around on the disc golf course - blocking people's shots or helping them, throwing darts at each other, or just hanging out in the lobby (and much more)... Rec Room really showcases how amazing VR can be when playing online with others.It's truly a must have for VR, and for it to be free to play is phenomenal.			",140,36,2,11,27,5,8

								Extremely entertaining for a free game.  EDIT: I am 20 hours in and still having fun.  Looks like I bought a Vive to play a free game every day.  Experience varies based on active playerbase.  Sometimes you get stuck with duds and sometimes you find people who are fun.Paintball, charades and dodgeball are a ton of fun.EDIT: Had to break from all non-work related activities for over a month.  Returned to update this after launch Rec Room for the first time in a while and playing the newly added co-op theater gamemode.  I didn't think Rec Room could get any more impressive for a free game but I was proven very, very wrong.  Most fun I have had in a long time with three random VRers.			",392,123,11,54,60,9,69

								At first I wasn't that impressed with this game but they do so many updates that are very well thought out. An example is the recently introduced mute yourself gesture which is covering your mouth, something that is intuitive and immediate. It's really nice to see the developers listen to people's concerns and strive for balanced updates that are help most and don't hinder people that otherwise might feel constricted. This is going to be a powerhouse VR company in the future.			",36,18,5,0,20,3,3

								Quite honestly, this game is not for me. I can't really get into the whole social-VR thing with absolute strangers, so I can't recommend rec room for people with that same mindset. Close knit stuff like bigscreen or VRChat are more what I'm after, not to mention the incredible ratio of children running around in rec room dicking around. All that said, don't take my word for it, its free! Just give it a shot, even if I don't recommend this.			",96,20,2,7,18,1,4

								games such as dodge ball are broken. Hitting people and not being resigetered. Blocking balls with your own works some times but will often get you resigted as being hit, despite the fact that it hit the front of your ball. Other mini games also have their own problems. Once they fix the issues they are having i could see my self coming back and playing hours more but i do not seeing this happening since this game was released in may.Get ready to be spammed by kids, alot of none english speaking asians, the vast majority of these asians will be women that cant play for♥♥♥♥♥♥ and finally, morons that cant breath properly and decieded to keep their mics on at all times.

								I've had some fun with Rec Room in the past, but now the recent update says that children under 13 aren't allowed. Part of the fun of this Wii looking game was watching my son experience a VR sandbox. It's a shame that it's come to this because there have been plenty of tools to create parties or mute offenders. The games play so loose anyway that it's hard to believe anyone takes it super competitively.For that reason it's now uninstalled for good on my system and I no longer recommend it. To me it was a great example of a family game, but with that expressly forbidden, there's no reason to play this game as there are better versions of the fun stuff to be had with other apps that do it better.

								Pretty boring gameplay, but now contains virtual safe spaces, which is childish.28.07.16: Tried the new Paintball mode. Easily the best part of this ""game"", but still quite flawed. Nonsense like spawning right in the line of fire. Spawning at a random location with no way to determine which way you're facing relative to the enemy. Spawning without a weapon, sometimes but not others. Invincible players.Worth trying only for the paintball.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I'm not much for the free games on steam. Especially one like this that seems to be marketed towards kids. But the game is wildly entertaining. It's as if a bunch of my friends and I broke into the school and took it completely over. There's a whole mix of age in there. I've played with people that I swear could be 4 years old and others that are middle aged. So it was weird to join a game where it was more ""adult"" humor. Then join the same game 5 min later with nothing but children. The game is free and there's quite a bit of games and nonsense going on. It's worth a try. If you don't like it, at least you didn't spend money on it.			",260,34,3,30,25,3,16

								This game is where I've spent most of my VR time as of writing this review, the best way to describe it is as a YMCA in VR.  You can drop in and out at any time with friends or other internet strangers to play painball, shrades, or even a mocking but very adorable and amusing dungeon crawler.  The games are very fun with controls that feel natural and intuitive (with the Vive Controllers) as well as the graphics being very stylized so that the entire game is easy on your hardware, but also easy on your eyes and good looking.All the games within Rec-Room require very little playable space, with the exception of the ""shield soccer"" minigame where you may want more space to avoid punching your walls or furniture.Overall, its free, its fun, its a great way to meet other people with VR hardware, its multi-platform (supporting both the Vive and Rift, which is always a great thing to see, since limiting the VR market and making games headset or OS exclusive is the worst thing for VR right now) and it's got a taste of a wide variety of VR experiences.

								When I first got the Vive, I pretty much downloaded every free game available. I tried most of them out, but needless to say,Rec Room earned a special place in my list of favourite VR games. It's the perfect combination between a social hangout and an action-packed game. I've had as much fun derping around in the lobby and doing virtual bottle flip challenges with people as I had playing the actual games. VR Paintball? Heck yes! Zero-G ball tennis? Awesome! Frisbee golfing? Totally! Throwing pointy darts at eachother? Of course!Positive points: Multiplayer Lobby shenanigans Creative gamemodes Friendly family-based design FreeNegative points: Weird body physics sometimes Few gamemodes Teleport ability during Paintball and DodgeballPeople say this is a must-have for any Vive owner, and to be honest, they are totally right. The friendly social vibe that hangs around this game makes me see it more of a place to be, than a program to start up.			",55,7,2,8,27,1,0

I cannot recommend it enough. The graphics are simple, but highly effective compared to a majority of Vive titles currently avaliable, the multiplayer latency is very workable, and the collection of games (which will only continue to grow) are quick and immersive (expecially dodgeball)!

								If you own a compatible HMD get in there, It's Free and it's a lot of Fun!! It is still early days and it does need some tweaking, I had to enable reprojection as soon as i went in as my old i7 950@ 3.7 and gtx1070 had a lot of frame loss with all the people around the punching dummy,  but from what I have read there are Lots of updates on the way and I am really looking forward to them. I would really recommend you have your chaperone turned on full or you may well end up with some thing broken as the games can make you get a bit carried away ;=} I am really impressed with AltSpaces sound setup and would love to see the Dev's implement some thing similar here, I am past my prime and hearing is not as good as it used to be ;( so  being able to hear those close to you as opposed to those across the room is really a nice feature.This is the first multi-user experience I have been in that comes close to being a possible Altspace killer in the future.Great job Dev's keep up the good work.

								I saw this was one of the most popular VR games but put it off thinking that the multiplayer would ruin it and it would not be fun. Despite not having any friends to play VR with I managed to meet a lot of new, cool and interesting people who I made friends with and play with on a daily basis. This is a really great place to chill, the only con is the fact that you have to deal with a damn wire tripping you up which isn't even the games problem.PROS:EverythingCONS:Nothing			",146,26,1,15,17,6,8

								The best Vive game out there. One of the hassles about vive is you have to spend 10 dollers on every game when the game is just about one thing, Rec Room has a ton of games you would have to pay 10 dollers for for free.Each game is fun in its own way and your never waiting for more players to join so you can play.  My favorite part:As soon as you enter the Locker room you are greeted by tons of other players hanging out, talking, and playing catch, pool, ect.			",178,14,6,15,26,2,10

								A great fun game to play, I only really play paintball in it and it's OK. However the lag nowdays (from the UK) sometimes means, you hit someone, it pings and then then shoot back. Something not right, in other instances people are floating across the playing field or they seem to move a lot quicker than you can, I can only imagine it's the lag. I'm using a pretty high spec PC and the internet connection is an ADSL line so not sure what the problem is. However it does make the game a bit unfair at time.			",10,4,2,0,3,2,0

								I've not tried any of the other games yet, but the paintball alone is worth a download.Easily one of the best VR free to play things I've tried. Easy and self explanatory controls and interactions, Great design over all. Just a standout game. Figuring out you can toss your gun in the air and then catch it made me giggle.It seems like the devs are updating it pretty constantly, which is great, but honestly for a free game the paintball alone is blinding. Such a simple concept made into endless fun by virtue of VR!			",483,170,13,79,51,4,79

								Rec Room is one of the top VR experiences right now.  The mini sports games are certainly fun in their own right.  But what differentiates Rec Room from the countless other VR games out there?  Rec Room has truly created an excellent environment to interact & play games with other online players!  As such, the extent of your fun will vary depending on those players around you.  But with a great lobby system, customization & various games to play, there is plenty to do & ways to be entertained.  Kudos to the developer for making online playing incredibly fun in VR and I look forward to seeing what they will add in the future!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								A few times since I got my Vive, I have had what I would call ""transformative experiences,"" which made me realize all of the amazing things this new medium has to offer. My first few hours with Rec Room were, without question, the strongest such experience. This game shows how powerful VR can be as a social medium, challenging the classic perception of gamers as anti-social introverts. The graphic style of the game reinforces it's core idea: casual fun. Chat with people, play ping pong, toss a frisbee around, or go for one of the more formally organized games. Meet people. Talk to them. Have fun. It's hard to capture the magic of Rec Room, so just go download it.			",110,59,2,4,22,2,12

								Surprisingly fun. Graphics are simple but the art style kind of promotes this playful mindset which is rather nice. The music kind of just promotes this fun atmosphere as well. Frisbee golf and Paintball are the highlights with some of the other games seemingly fun as well even though there weren't enough people to play them, Shield Soccer in particular looks like a lot of fun if you can get a team together. Customization options are really nice too. You can be all creeds and colors with some pretty zany atire. Overall, a lot of fun, and for the price-tag(free) you can't beat it. Grab a buddy, grab some beers and just have a good time.			",410,73,4,26,14,1,26

								This game wins out in the social VR gaming space! Fun customisation, solid physics, and regular updates makes this a must play. A key highlight is the way the devs try and allow you to do everything without using a menu - I can party up by fistbumping, mute myself by covering my mouth with my hand, and record my favourite moments by picking up a camera in game.There's a few early games to play, including Dodgeball, Disc Golf, Paddleball. Real highlight is Charades, which is basically 3D pictionary. I don't think I've laughed that hard in a long time.Do yourself a favour - download this game and just start making friends. Vive kits are few and far between, so this is a great place to meet other Vivers to then party up with for other games!			",368,104,12,24,60,13,31

								A very enjoyable social hangout and multiplayer game hub.It should be noted that the fun of this game relies on its friendly, welcoming and non-toxic community. Shout out to you guys for following the rules and being nice. I hope increasing publicity for this game won't attract any unwanted visitors, but we can only hope.There is a good amount of customisation for your character that I will leave you to discover. Throughout the building are lots of interactives and toys to mess around with. Play frisbee from the attic or Beer Pong with basketballs! I made friends with a random guy following a dance-fight frisbee bout that included head balancing, teleporting and many a spin.The many games, including Dodgeball, Paintball, 3D Charades and Disc Golf, are all stable, fun and balanced.I had some trouble with finding how to configure Push-To-Talk mic settings, rendering my ability at 3D Charades inert.Overall, I strongly recommend this game to people looking for a pastime, social hangout or fun games.

								Threw darts at a guys stomach and balls. While he removed the darts i put a bucket on his head. BlindPlayed some tabletennis with a nice french lady when suddenly i got teleported on a paintballfield. Well okay, ran around the field with some screaming people and a kid. The kid was so small he couldnt watch over his cover. I kneed down besides him and laughed at him. When suddenly someone shot me from behind and waved at me. ♥♥♥♥erAfter the match i got teleported to some dodgeball. Played some dodgeball with someone who clearly was living with a vacuum cleaner on his head when suddenly the french lady appears nearby, waved at me and watched me winning dodgeball so we danced some macarena afterwards.Get back into paintball for another hour, ♥♥♥♥ yea			",149,27,3,5,10,2,13

Between the social aspects and the simple but fun mini-games, Rec Room hits the mark and shows the true potential for VR.I'd be willing to pay upwards of $20 for this experience but for now, its absolutely free.

								I'll first start with the fact that I've never left a review for anything, and so this is in part also a praise to the power of the Vive.So the short and sweet: I love this game, and like so many have stated, its ONLY IN ALPHA! I cannot recommend it enough. The graphics are simple, but highly effective compared to a majority of Vive titles currently avaliable, the multiplayer latency is very workable, and the collection of games (which will only continue to grow) are quick and immersive (expecially dodgeball)!

								If you own a compatible HMD get in there, It's Free and it's a lot of Fun!! It is still early days and it does need some tweaking, I had to enable reprojection as soon as i went in as my old i7 950@ 3.7 and gtx1070 had a lot of frame loss with all the people around the punching dummy,  but from what I have read there are Lots of updates on the way and I am really looking forward to them. I would really recommend you have your chaperone turned on full or you may well end up with some thing broken as the games can make you get a bit carried away ;=} I am really impressed with AltSpaces sound setup and would love to see the Dev's implement some thing similar here, I am past my prime and hearing is not as good as it used to be ;( so  being able to hear those close to you as opposed to those across the room is really a nice feature.This is the first multi-user experience I have been in that comes close to being a possible Altspace killer in the future.Great job Dev's keep up the good work.

								Wow. This provides proof VR is going to revolutionize gaming.AND IT'S FREE!!!Paintball in Rec Room is the first game in VR that has me going back for more. It's the first VR game I've owned where I sit at work and think ""I would love to just get home and play some paintball right now"".... and this is after 2 weeks of playing it!The devs are awesome. They listen to the community like no other. They are in an interesting position right now owning this piece of software. They may not be making money now, but as soon as they implement any official way of paying (be it in game purchases or whatever they choose) you can bet I'll spend some just out of principale.

								Rec Room is easily the most fun I've had with my Vive so far, which is espicially impressive consdering that it's free. The game modes are well done, and there's lots of little things to love. The video camera, for instance, is a great idea. You can pick it up in game and use it to record videos to your computer, using it just like a real handheld video camera. I also have to say I really love the locker room. The locker room is the area where you choose which game mode to play, but it doubles as a lobby/sandbox area. There's dodgeballs, darts, water bottles, and much more. It's amazing how much it can be to just mess around in there with strangers. Speaking of strangers, Rec Room is a great place to meet people. I imagine that a lot of people are like me, and know either none or very few people that also have a Vive. I've made a few friends playing Rec Room that I can now go and play other VR games with, thanks to it's social design. I have only run into the rare glitch, and nothing too bad so far. The main thing that bugs me about it is that the game needs more content. For example, paintball is great but it only has one map and two game modes (team deathmatch and capture the flag). More maps is a must but it would also be nice to maybe see a free for all mode or others. There are a few other matters of polish and quality of life that could be addressed also. For example, between matches in paintball a single player can start the next match almost immedietly after the first without any sort of vote from other players. At the very least they should impliment a minimum time between matches, even if it's fairly short. I also think it should pop up a box asking you if you want your mic to be always on or push to talk when you play for the first time. Few people expect their mic to be hot all the time by default.Overall, great game, but I want more stuff! I wouldn't mind paying for some DLC if it had good content.			",230,34,9,21,69,4,58

								This game is probably the most fun ive had with my vive since it was released. I can't beleive it is FREE. Their are so many different things to do,  and it is one of the best social games on the vive as well. The paontball is an absolute blast to play!                I can see myself getting many more hours into this game. Its pretty rare to want to play something for 2 hours straight in vr the first time with no breaks.			",65,5,3,6,12,3,1

								Surprisingly fun. Graphics are simple but the art style kind of promotes this playful mindset which is rather nice. The music kind of just promotes this fun atmosphere as well. Frisbee golf and Paintball are the highlights with some of the other games seemingly fun as well even though there weren't enough people to play them, Shield Soccer in particular looks like a lot of fun if you can get a team together. Customization options are really nice too. You can be all creeds and colors with some pretty zany atire. Overall, a lot of fun, and for the price-tag(free) you can't beat it. Grab a buddy, grab some beers and just have a good time.			",410,73,4,26,14,1,26

								Some games are better than others, and some games are way better than others. This is one of those games that is way better than others. First off, this game is amazing. I cant say enough good things about it. It is so well put together and everything just clicks. so far in my 7.5 hours of playing this I have nit run into any glitches or crashes. (except for when my friend unplugged my Vive) I can tell that every part of this game has been thought out and created with percision. And for me one of my favorite part is just hanging out talk with otehr players. So in all I definetly recommend this game.p.s.   i nominated this game for the ""just 5 more minutes""  award.

								Rec Room is quite the social experience.  You get to hang out in the waiting room with other people, play some casual ping pong, even pick up a camera and record gifs.  Then you get to move into gaming areas.  By far my favorite game was paintball.  The teleport function has a cool down so you're not zipping across the map, and the shooting has a really good feel to it.  It's quite the experience getting to the edge of a wall and blind firing around the corner at the other team.  Considering this is free, I would have gladly paid for the experience it offers.

								I just did my first couple sessions in rec room playing paintball. I really enjoyed the cover focused level layout that made the teleportation movement and firing machanics shine. The game is a lot more social than I expected and that made it easy to find people to play with in the locker room hub. I'll be checking out the other games in rec room as I get more time with it.

								A great fun game to play, I only really play paintball in it and it's OK. However the lag nowdays (from the UK) sometimes means, you hit someone, it pings and then then shoot back. Something not right, in other instances people are floating across the playing field or they seem to move a lot quicker than you can, I can only imagine it's the lag. I'm using a pretty high spec PC and the internet connection is an ADSL line so not sure what the problem is. However it does make the game a bit unfair at time.			",10,4,2,0,3,2,0

The Paintball mini-game is my top 3 favorite VR Games! Well done to the creators of ""Rec Room"" it has been a very fun experiencing Rec Room in general! Great add on! Thanks alot! I love it!My ideas/thoughtsIt would be cool to make a similar game with realistic looking graphics & instead of just see'ing the upper body, designing the whole thing kinda of like ""Vr Raw Data"" did, but hopefully better.

As soon as you enter the lobby or ""locker room"" you are talking to and interacting with other people. The most fun i've had with my vive yet is staying up till all hours of the morning playing 3d charades with random people in rec room. Plus paintball, pattle ball, frisbe golf, and dodgeball are all great games; totally free.			",68,32,1,12,20,2,20

								GEnuinely the most fun I've had so far in VR. The graphics are simple and cheerful but colourful and bright enough to overcome the Vive's screen door issues and, within minutes, you are totally immersed.My first adventure was just pratting around in the Rec Room lobby - a social club with various physical items you can throw around, a couple of games to play and the avatar design room (as of July 2016 - I preferred the old system as the new one calls for a little too much walking and turning to select items).After a little time meeting new people and chatting I tried out some of the minigames. During one, I turned round after hearing my name, and my friend was standing spectating me. Formed a party and then off to play the brilliant (but too short) Frisbee Golf , followed by the also fantastic 3D Charades. My high point was in 3D charades where, in order to describe James Bond, I drew the opening credits iris and then used my avatar to walk into the centre and turn and shoot just like Bond. They got it eventually but it really made me feel that this was a game where anything goes and you can do pretty much as you please.The latest addition, Paintball, is hands down the most fun I've had in VR, the most action adn teh best multiplayer.Sneaking up to the opponent's flag base and then leaning through the windows and round corners to clear the way before a flag steal is just amazing. For a £20 game I would be impressed. For a FREE game, I'm beyond stunned. Rec Room deserves to be a huge success as it's truly fantastic and a must have for any VR owner.			",12,1,4,0,2,1,0

								Used to absolutely love the Frisbee Gold that came with PlayStation Move, so finding a VR version, for free no less, was fantastic. This would get a recommendation from me just for that but this has loads of other games and great social features too. A lot of VR software is really very overpriced for what it is, so it's great to see a developer treating customers with respect rather than basically charging people to be their guinea pigs as so many seem to be doing these days.

								Rec Room is currently my favorite application.  I haven't had this much fun playing a game in years.  The collection of activities enables any type of user to hop in and simply have a great time.  If it's just haging out in the locker room, guessing whatever it is that squggly line is supposed to be in 3D Charades, or going at it with anohter team in Paintball, you are bound to have a plain wonderful experience.  Currently the other users are friendly and helpful.  They help bring this application to new levels of enjoyment.Not exactly child friendly, although most users are considerate enough to take manners into account.Can't recommend this enough!!

								The videos and screenshots didn't appeal to me, but I decided to give it a shot. As soon as I was in the first room where you customize your avatar, I already heard voices and at first I thought it's pre-recorded stuff. Turned out it's real people. So you get into the ""public social experience"" aspect of this head on, there's no tutorial, and I think it's great that you jump straight into it. The other people immediately taught me everything that I didn't figure out myself. The whole multiplayer experience was seamless and instantaneous for me. I quickly found my way to the paintball area and played a few matches of capture the flag. Again, you just jump right in, and learn as you go. I quickly stopped noticing the simplicity of the graphics and was just playing paintball. You teleport around a lot, but it still felt like regular paintball tactics worked. The ""gun"" could use more vibration for immersion, but otherwise I can't see any obvious flaws. Great experience so far!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The fact that this VR game is free, is beyond me. THIS IS THE FUTURE OF VR.It may be unpolished and thrown into the mess of early VR gaming, but don't judge too quickly, this game has the most potential of anything available. The following game mechanics are listed in the following order from 'perfect' to 'needs work':Frisbee - Needs no work, feels super realistic!Boxing - This is mostly due to the collision detection with the dummy, feels perfect! Now just needs a boxing match game with friends!Ping Pong - Collision detection is mostly true, some false hits/game breaks ever-so-rarely.Paintball - Hitbox is great, paintball needs more velocity, a reload function is a need with too many people spamming paintballs, esentially, ""making it rain"". I also have had been hit before without it counting as a hit. Pisses off other players and myself. Ball - Ball feels too heavy, gravity is pretty strong on it, low bounce. Dodgeball needs these improvements.Overall-Graphics: 7/10Gameplay: 8/10Multiplayer: 9/10Side note: It may be just me (my connection or my tracking?), but players seem to drift and float away every 5-10 seconds then return to normal. Happens in-game and lobby. Difficult to play a game of VR paddleball and paintball can be frustrating.  ",69,14,3,1,17,1,2

								There's no better game available to introduce friends to VR. The social component and breadth of games available, which seem to be expanding on a daily basis, make this one of Vive's premiere titles. There's more value already than many $30 games, and it's pretty astounding how rapidly the devs have been adding experiences. Not only my most recommended free game, but my most recommended Vive title.			",83,24,1,8,10,2,21

								Incredible experience and shows the potential of VR. The ability to interact with others in a way that is embodied makes it a joyful experience with others. The ability to be total goofballs with strangers, to interact and have an absolute blast, that's what its all about. The games themselves are great, with the paintball being the best multiplayer shooter experience the vive has to offer. I'm also partial to the disc golf, as it feels just right, just as a disc should when you toss it. Amazing.			",120,18,1,7,3,2,7

								In the past two months, I have broken an overhead light jumping for a frisbee, almost knocked myself out running into a bookcase lunging for a soccer ball, put two Vive-controller-shaped dents in my wall by reencacting scenes from The Matrix in paintball, and had more fun with VR than I ever thought possible.Plus, if you care about this sort of thing, according to my fitness tracker I burn as many calories per hour in Rec Room as I would playing kickball, backpacking, canoeing, or shoveling snow. That's a nice bonus.This game alone has justified my purchase of the Vive. I seriously can't recommend it highly enough.			",94,29,2,23,26,2,4

								Used to absolutely love the Frisbee Gold that came with PlayStation Move, so finding a VR version, for free no less, was fantastic. This would get a recommendation from me just for that but this has loads of other games and great social features too. A lot of VR software is really very overpriced for what it is, so it's great to see a developer treating customers with respect rather than basically charging people to be their guinea pigs as so many seem to be doing these days.

								A few times since I got my Vive, I have had what I would call ""transformative experiences,"" which made me realize all of the amazing things this new medium has to offer. My first few hours with Rec Room were, without question, the strongest such experience. This game shows how powerful VR can be as a social medium, challenging the classic perception of gamers as anti-social introverts. The graphic style of the game reinforces it's core idea: casual fun. Chat with people, play ping pong, toss a frisbee around, or go for one of the more formally organized games. Meet people. Talk to them. Have fun. It's hard to capture the magic of Rec Room, so just go download it.			",110,59,2,4,22,2,12

								The best multiplayer experience for Vive, so far. That's a bold statement, what with Hover Junkers floating around (no pun intended), but this game is not only free, it ups the insanity to 11, and provides so many enjoyable things to do.My personal favourite is trying to throw long-shots through the hoop, though instead of using balls, I use whatever items I can find lying around the lobby. The best part? There are others in the lobby as well, and they'll see what you've done and often laugh and cheer.You can customize your character's appearance, all looks being pretty entertaining and ridiculous, then you can jump into the lobby and from there choose an actual game to take part in. The lobby has all sorts of fun little activities, but there are actual fields for each competition, from paintball to dodgeball, there's a little something for everyone. And for those who just want to raise a little hell, you can even throw darts in your own face and walk around with a face full of darts. Rec Room is pure magic.			",210,61,8,44,61,3,19

								Without question this is the most fun I've had in VR.  I'm addicted to Paintball!To the Devs:  Turning the world (driving the bus motion) is EXTREMELY difficult.  It's either too sensitive and spins about uncontrollably, or hardly moves at all.  When you do finally get it where you want it, the mere motion of lifting your finger off the pad is too much motion to keep it in place!I recommend making it less sensative, or perhaps scrapping the technique altogether.Also, it would be helpful to be able to spin the world in-place, without the possiblity of accidentally teleporting. Many times I've been in a comfortable shielded spot, tried to spin the world, and ended up away from that spot out in the open--where I was promptly ghosted.Great game guys, keep up the good work!

								Very polished work with great mini games !The dev team is very active and making this the best VR game so far... paintball itself is already the only enjoyable multiplayer FPS on VR!The only drawback could be the simple design of the characters it seems there are a few customisation options only but I'm sure it will grow soon. This kind of game can keep you entertained for hours without sitting your fat*ss on a chair, nice way to take gamers back to sport ;)			",45,16,0,3,15,1,14

								I was able to play with people from all across the world in the same room! And the best part is I got to do that for free. Well I guess not actually free since I had to own a vive. But still! Then the unexpected happened( well I guess it's actually expected because well we are humans lol) we started being childish, and I'm sure you know what I mean by that ;) ... Although the first lobby I joined there was a 10 I think year old girl from the UK in there and I didn't know how to feel because it's a video game and I'm playing with a kid.... But in a VR world. *Shower Thought*Are you a creep/predator if you play with a child in VR...			",258,37,5,19,24,4,10

								Have only played 7.5 hours so far, but is one of the best games in my library. Most physics are fantastic  but if you try to abuse them, they can break. If you put 3 darts on a frisbee and try to toss it, the frisbee can float in the air. I haven't found anyhing that makes the game unplayable, just a few odd physics that makes the game more fun. All of my experiences with players in game have been great, no one cussing or yelling at each other.			",37,6,0,6,7,1,1

								A simply MUST HAVE. I can't believe you can actually start playing this for free. It says you get more when you become a member and I'm assuming without reading that they want munies, but damn man shut up and take my money already. So many garbage VR games on sale for 10, 20 even 40 dollars and they are just bad implementations of somewhat good games. This.. Now let me tell you about this game:You start off in your safe room where you can get to know the game alone which I thought was cute, a soft ease in if you will.. After that you enter something of a lobby where you can hang out with others and oh yes your mic works too. I found it really fun just to high five other people and throw balls around - really basic stuff. But then.. oh yes, but then:I went into a gameroom and chose paintball, and boy was it on. There were capture the flag and deathmatch modes rotating and it was unbelievably fun to play. Even picking up a sniper rifle with an actual scope you had to look through - granted the scope was large but oh that priceless moment when I realized to get to a high ground and go prone and just snipe people from afar.. No one touched me. I hope you force yourself to download this if you own an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. DO NOT PASS IT UP even íf you had to pay for it. It's just that good.			",33,6,0,1,6,1,0

Rec Room gives you a bunch of virtual reality mini-games to play with your friends and strangers, all accessible from a central hub (or lobby). This game allows you to customize your character extensively, hold your hand over your mouth to mute if needed, take photos and video to record moments and even play charades. Dodgeball, disc golf, paddleball, paintball and more will both give you a workout and a ride.			",68,9,1,5,9,2,3

								This is my favorite game for VR.  I was not expecting the social aspect to be so much fun and engaging, especially with charades.  I could stand in the lobby upstairs throwing the discs into the basketball goal downstairs all day long. I cannot wait to see what they have in store for the future... and this is a free game!EDIT 7/20 Okay so this is now the best game on VR hands down.  Paintball came out today and it is team based capture the flag with pistol paintball guns.  The physics of the paintballs falling work so well and when you hit someone it makes a ""ding"" noise and they reset.  All the controls work the same as the rest of the game as far a sholding and grabbing.Dont forget charades, I have had some hilarious experiences with that.  It is so much fun hanging out with a group of randos playing charades and one of them pulls the card jellyfish but draws a giant weiner first and then draws an elegant jellyfish off the tip of it.  Try this game.			",172,44,11,19,26,7,24

If you have trouble finding a game with someone already in it, choose the quick game mode to meet new people and play a new game too. The disc golf and voice interaction were my first experiences. Being able to talk to people in vr and interact on a social level is exactly what this new style of gaming deserves.			",158,37,1,18,23,1,2

								This is a GREAT collection of games for free. The best part though is the that the whole thing is pretty much a multiplayer experiance. As soon as you enter the lobby or ""locker room"" you are talking to and interacting with other people. The most fun i've had with my vive yet is staying up till all hours of the morning playing 3d charades with random people in rec room. Plus paintball, pattle ball, frisbe golf, and dodgeball are all great games; totally free.			",68,32,1,12,20,2,20

								Rec Room is easily one of my favorite experiences to date.The multiplayer functionality is unmatched so far in VR, as well as the breadth of options and games to play. All for free!The humor that emerges is fantastic, albeit sometimes dark and adult, is my favorite part about it. The interaction with others in a virtual space as if we're in the same room really takes me out of reality.I highly recommend this game. I've made 3 videos on this game if you care to check them out!https://youtu.be/cEcF0BP50WY?list=PLZqFOPcnRD2JMkvPuatP_ASJHLaUR8vcXhttps://youtu.be/lEfSK9oblFM?list=PLZqFOPcnRD2JMkvPuatP_ASJHLaUR8vcXhttps://youtu.be/K7UvPeRgNbc?list=PLZqFOPcnRD2JMkvPuatP_ASJHLaUR8vcX ",482,121,10,45,79,5,46

Anytime I allow him VR time he instantly go's to this game and starts laughing and having fun and interacting with other players.....it is such a joy to watch him having so much fun where otherwise he would just be watching some crappy tv show or bla....fantastic game! For the price of free this might possibly be one of the best VR games in the free price range. DEFINITELY get this one! It is updated so often with new features and games			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								One of the best / most fun games for the Vive so far, and its free, so go get it.Paintball is great fun, so is pictionary, and then theres even more to do (like soccer, pingpong, basketball, etc etc)As a bonus you get to point and laugh at Oculus users playing a time limited demo of this trough their own store ;)Edit: By the way for anybody wondering, you join an existing game (pictionary paintball or whatever) by fistbumping a person thats already playing, when you do that you will be assigned to the red or blue team, else you stay in the white team and are just a spectator.

								There's no better game available to introduce friends to VR. The social component and breadth of games available, which seem to be expanding on a daily basis, make this one of Vive's premiere titles. There's more value already than many $30 games, and it's pretty astounding how rapidly the devs have been adding experiences. Not only my most recommended free game, but my most recommended Vive title.			",83,24,1,8,10,2,21

								Rec Room is currently my favorite application.  I haven't had this much fun playing a game in years.  The collection of activities enables any type of user to hop in and simply have a great time.  If it's just haging out in the locker room, guessing whatever it is that squggly line is supposed to be in 3D Charades, or going at it with anohter team in Paintball, you are bound to have a plain wonderful experience.  Currently the other users are friendly and helpful.  They help bring this application to new levels of enjoyment.Not exactly child friendly, although most users are considerate enough to take manners into account.Can't recommend this enough!!

								In the past two months, I have broken an overhead light jumping for a frisbee, almost knocked myself out running into a bookcase lunging for a soccer ball, put two Vive-controller-shaped dents in my wall by reencacting scenes from The Matrix in paintball, and had more fun with VR than I ever thought possible.Plus, if you care about this sort of thing, according to my fitness tracker I burn as many calories per hour in Rec Room as I would playing kickball, backpacking, canoeing, or shoveling snow. That's a nice bonus.This game alone has justified my purchase of the Vive. I seriously can't recommend it highly enough.			",94,29,2,23,26,2,4

								Incredible experience and shows the potential of VR. The ability to interact with others in a way that is embodied makes it a joyful experience with others. The ability to be total goofballs with strangers, to interact and have an absolute blast, that's what its all about. The games themselves are great, with the paintball being the best multiplayer shooter experience the vive has to offer. I'm also partial to the disc golf, as it feels just right, just as a disc should when you toss it. Amazing.			",120,18,1,7,3,2,7

Rec Room is in my eyes the PERFECT example how a VR Multiplayer game has to be and how social VR can be!I have made a gameplay video of the game, you DON'T HAVE TO click on it!

								To be honest, at first it felt a little strange and awkward to virtually be near people of who you could see their head and hand movements so clearly. But after some getting used to I started to see how awesome it is to play games in virtual reality with and against other people. It feels awesome when you shoot a blob of paint in someone's face and he/she laughs and waves at you. It's really an experience.			",325,94,10,29,40,6,32

								Great game. Everyone who has tried VR loves paintball. The sports and social interactions are amazing. Not for complexity, but everything in this game just works, which shows polish. A lot of vr games lack polish and social interaction and this game does both to a high degree so it really shows anyone who tries it what the future of polished VR gaming could look like.

I played for 3 1/2 hours straight my first time in and had an absolute blast! Met some great people, played all kinds of sports, and had some hilarious experiences and interactions that had nearly everyone in the room bent over or rolling on the floor laughing uncontrollably. If you want to have a grand old time buddying up with people to play a variety of recreational games and generally just mess around in a VR sandbox environment while reminiscing about the light hearted joys of childhood, play this game!

								I'll first start with the fact that I've never left a review for anything, and so this is in part also a praise to the power of the Vive.So the short and sweet: I love this game, and like so many have stated, its ONLY IN ALPHA! I cannot recommend it enough. The graphics are simple, but highly effective compared to a majority of Vive titles currently avaliable, the multiplayer latency is very workable, and the collection of games (which will only continue to grow) are quick and immersive (expecially dodgeball)!

								If you own a compatible HMD get in there, It's Free and it's a lot of Fun!! It is still early days and it does need some tweaking, I had to enable reprojection as soon as i went in as my old i7 950@ 3.7 and gtx1070 had a lot of frame loss with all the people around the punching dummy,  but from what I have read there are Lots of updates on the way and I am really looking forward to them. I would really recommend you have your chaperone turned on full or you may well end up with some thing broken as the games can make you get a bit carried away ;=} I am really impressed with AltSpaces sound setup and would love to see the Dev's implement some thing similar here, I am past my prime and hearing is not as good as it used to be ;( so  being able to hear those close to you as opposed to those across the room is really a nice feature.This is the first multi-user experience I have been in that comes close to being a possible Altspace killer in the future.Great job Dev's keep up the good work.

								When I first got the Vive, I pretty much downloaded every free game available. I tried most of them out, but needless to say,Rec Room earned a special place in my list of favourite VR games. It's the perfect combination between a social hangout and an action-packed game. I've had as much fun derping around in the lobby and doing virtual bottle flip challenges with people as I had playing the actual games. VR Paintball? Heck yes! Zero-G ball tennis? Awesome! Frisbee golfing? Totally! Throwing pointy darts at eachother? Of course!Positive points: Multiplayer Lobby shenanigans Creative gamemodes Friendly family-based design FreeNegative points: Weird body physics sometimes Few gamemodes Teleport ability during Paintball and DodgeballPeople say this is a must-have for any Vive owner, and to be honest, they are totally right. The friendly social vibe that hangs around this game makes me see it more of a place to be, than a program to start up.			",55,7,2,8,27,1,0

								This game is where I've spent most of my VR time as of writing this review, the best way to describe it is as a YMCA in VR.  You can drop in and out at any time with friends or other internet strangers to play painball, shrades, or even a mocking but very adorable and amusing dungeon crawler.  The games are very fun with controls that feel natural and intuitive (with the Vive Controllers) as well as the graphics being very stylized so that the entire game is easy on your hardware, but also easy on your eyes and good looking.All the games within Rec-Room require very little playable space, with the exception of the ""shield soccer"" minigame where you may want more space to avoid punching your walls or furniture.Overall, its free, its fun, its a great way to meet other people with VR hardware, its multi-platform (supporting both the Vive and Rift, which is always a great thing to see, since limiting the VR market and making games headset or OS exclusive is the worst thing for VR right now) and it's got a taste of a wide variety of VR experiences.

								The past hour in this game was genuinely the most fun I have ever had. That either says a lot about this game, little about how exciting my life is, or a little bit of both. Either way, Muting my mic and being the child/pet/toy of the room and having objects stacked on my head with everybody around me laughing and having fun fealt beyond a game or VR. Even for that one hour, it was like a closed group of stranger-friends that you are with for an hour and then you leave.And I don't even have to interect with humans in the real world!The future is now.

								Downloaded this game on a whim bc brookhaven stressed me the f--- out:). But im glad i did. Loads of fun even tho this is still early access. Physics with some things are off but im sure itll get better. Frisbee golf is amazing hope we get more than 4 holes. Dodgeball is great altho somewhat dangerous. Also love the freedom u have. 1st time i played someone asked me to play hide and go seek. 2nd time i played we put buckets on the pingpong table and played beer pong. As long as the devs give us more real games and more toys/props to make our own fun this will be THE app to get. 1 request to the devs-maybe make it easier to add friends u met in recroom to ur steam friends? A fist bump/hi-5 would be so much easier than searching for names on steam😬			",41,31,2,6,20,4,0

								A simply MUST HAVE. I can't believe you can actually start playing this for free. It says you get more when you become a member and I'm assuming without reading that they want munies, but damn man shut up and take my money already. So many garbage VR games on sale for 10, 20 even 40 dollars and they are just bad implementations of somewhat good games. This.. Now let me tell you about this game:You start off in your safe room where you can get to know the game alone which I thought was cute, a soft ease in if you will.. After that you enter something of a lobby where you can hang out with others and oh yes your mic works too. I found it really fun just to high five other people and throw balls around - really basic stuff. But then.. oh yes, but then:I went into a gameroom and chose paintball, and boy was it on. There were capture the flag and deathmatch modes rotating and it was unbelievably fun to play. Even picking up a sniper rifle with an actual scope you had to look through - granted the scope was large but oh that priceless moment when I realized to get to a high ground and go prone and just snipe people from afar.. No one touched me. I hope you force yourself to download this if you own an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. DO NOT PASS IT UP even íf you had to pay for it. It's just that good.			",33,6,0,1,6,1,0

								I was pretty nervous when I heard about this game.I expected it to be wrought with social anxiety and violations of personal space, but VR Multiplayer is a dream and the community in this game is pretty fantastic.All of the games in here are uniformly great, and the paintball is one of the best free shooting games I have ever played in my entire life. I cannot wait to see what they do with the close-combat minigame they have in the works.There are occasionally a few idiots here and there who harass people or violate your personal space, but you can kick them or ghost them. I have only met one such person in my time spent playing this game. A report feature would be much appreciated, but I understand that would mean dedication of hours of time on the part of the staff to validate each report, and with such a small team for a free to play game I don't know if that's feasable.

								This game can be quite freaky for the first time you try it out, the whole 'social' idea of being able to talk to a bunch of people all over the world while they are walking around in front of you is quite overwhelming, but once you get the hang of it this game is probably one of the best for the Vive! The whole game comprises of minigames, ranging from Paintball to a family game of Charades. Although I suck at drawing; Charades is probably one of the coolest in the pack! Watching your peer break down in front of you with a terrible 3-year-old painted picture for you to guess from is all fun and games, until the game decides its your turn and you are having 5 people shouting at you. It really is a lot of fun though!I seriously reccomend this, I feel like ill be returning to it every now and again to earn new apparel for my virtual avatar, I'm still trying to process that this game is free (because it is better than a lot of the PAID shovelware currently floating around the VR store)			",86,19,3,10,17,1,7

								The magic of this game happens when people meet to play good oldfashoined games with all the additions that VR can bring.  It's fantastic fun, and at the time of writing the crowd is also friendly and helpful. It's also a very stylish production, feels like a truly complete VR game (some sports play better than others, mind you - Paintball is perhaps the best atm).  This game goes a long way to justiy the price of your expensive VR system all on it's own.  If you own a compatible system, you need to try this.  Give it a couple of hours, and dont be afraid to interact with others.  It's a eye-opening experience of what VR can be.			",65,17,1,7,13,1,2

								I'm not much for the free games on steam. Especially one like this that seems to be marketed towards kids. But the game is wildly entertaining. It's as if a bunch of my friends and I broke into the school and took it completely over. There's a whole mix of age in there. I've played with people that I swear could be 4 years old and others that are middle aged. So it was weird to join a game where it was more ""adult"" humor. Then join the same game 5 min later with nothing but children. The game is free and there's quite a bit of games and nonsense going on. It's worth a try. If you don't like it, at least you didn't spend money on it.			",260,34,3,30,25,3,16

								I usually dislike social events and mingling among strangers, but I can't stop telling people about this experience! I played for 3 1/2 hours straight my first time in and had an absolute blast! Met some great people, played all kinds of sports, and had some hilarious experiences and interactions that had nearly everyone in the room bent over or rolling on the floor laughing uncontrollably. If you want to have a grand old time buddying up with people to play a variety of recreational games and generally just mess around in a VR sandbox environment while reminiscing about the light hearted joys of childhood, play this game!

								I'll first start with the fact that I've never left a review for anything, and so this is in part also a praise to the power of the Vive.So the short and sweet: I love this game, and like so many have stated, its ONLY IN ALPHA! I cannot recommend it enough. The graphics are simple, but highly effective compared to a majority of Vive titles currently avaliable, the multiplayer latency is very workable, and the collection of games (which will only continue to grow) are quick and immersive (expecially dodgeball)!

								If nintendo made a VR game, it would be just like this.Fun, smooth and very well presented.Whether just looking in the mirror to change your look or in the main area messing about is a very pleasant experience. The most surprising element was that its one of the only multiplayer games where the community is not toxic.High fives, fist bumps and waving to complete strangers really gives a breath of fresh air to modern day gaming.The only downside is getting the rest of the family off it so I can have another go xDWhilst the game is free I cannot recommend it enough, hopefully it will stay this way to help keep the community active. It would be nice though if had a small optional payment for say custom skins to wear, as it would be nice to give these devs something back and to help keep development ongoing ;) ",872,282,53,68,99,6,115

There are fun daily challenges to complete as well, and they are forever updating it.  Each game forces social interaction as well so it's quite a bit of fun.Did I mention it's free?

So I use the Oculus app instead.I've met some awesome friendly and funny people. This game is on my ""most favourite games of all time"" list.And they're adding new content and really listen to their community.So there are many updates.I would love to see a bowling area inside the game.Thanks for reading this!Overall rating: 10/10.

								Wow, this game is the most fun I've had in VR so far! I've owned a Vive since release and so far haven't played much of the game that are on steam but this one, am I glad I installed. It got me back the desire to play games in VR. In my 2 hours of playtime I met and befriended 10 people amd they were all super nice to me.Want to just go chill in the main lobby and talk about games or other things. Check.Want to go play a variety of sports including paintball (so far the only activity I played) and have a blast pretenting you are in a real paintball game, lobing grenades or goof around by yelling suppressing fire and gunning like a mad man? Check.Want to attempt trick shot like hoops from across the map or flipping a water bottle and yelling I AM THE ONE, THE ONE TO SEE... Check!This game is a blast and would recommend to any VR owner to play. Especially given the price ;) haha. I don't know why they made the game free but I am very happy they did.

								A highly polished game with plenty of activities to do. There's lots of players who are talkative and will make the game  much more fun to play. Best of all of this is free, I'd gladly pay for it.			",364,102,8,38,53,6,51

								By far the coolest and most entertaining VR game I have played so far!It is very immersive and fun! You have some awesome interactions with people from all around the world, it is unbelievable that it is free to play!!! So many games that costs a lot of money are not even close to be as cool as this one!Recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Have fun with 12 year olds and 80 year olds, and even if they don't speak your language, you can still gesture plenty enough to form a kickass dodgeball team. It's like recess, for everyone, without falling off the monkey bars.9/10, needs monkey bars.			",95,40,3,5,23,2,6

								This game is fantastic, the developer could have easily priced this game at £10-£25 and it would have still been worth every penny however, it's FREE!! This is insane, it's like all the cool activites in real life have been bought into VR pain and exhaustion free, I can now play paintball without having giant welts, I can play dodgeball withou ever having to run! I can dab and due to it being in VR everyone thinks it's actually funny!All jokes aside this game is great, the paintball mode is a must try, you get all sorts of different things like sniper rifles, shields and grenades! This is Wii sports on pro mode.			",86,2,1,6,7,1,5

								Where have you been?This is one of the first titles that I downloaded then dismissed it after trying it for 15 minutes.I finally got around to really playing this and it's a whole lot of fun. Devs are still very active and the community is great.My only CON is the parents that let their kids play this. It's rated 13+ but there are some pretty young ones online. There's something for everyone here.Sports games like Dodgeball, Racketball and frizbee golfAction games like Painball and QuestSocial games like 3D Charades and hanging out in the main lobby.Totally customizable avatarsGreat physics Daily challenges ",54,18,2,1,7,2,3

								Rec Room is a mystery to me. It is a fantastic game with a ton of polish and is updated relatively often... yet it's free... like really free. Not free to play that gets you hooked early on and then you hit a wall of extreme difficulty or build timers or anything like that. It's just straight up free. How the Hell do these guys make money?Anyhow, it's great. Packed full of so many sports, from frisbee golf, to paintball, to dodgeball, or paddle ball, and it even has charades which is surprisingly fun and addictive with friends. The also added in a dungeon crawler game to it which is extremely difficult and requires some solid teamwork to get through. Then there's plenty of mini-games and such in the locker room area and really shows a cool social element to the game as you can chat with people and party up by fist-bumping other players. Players gain XP throughout all events and you unlock loot boxes that you actually get to unpack and they unlock new clothing and accesories to where on your avatar. 5/5 Seriously, how/why is this amazing game free?
