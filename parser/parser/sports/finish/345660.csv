												STAY AWAY FROM ALL MILESTONE GAMES.  THEY NEVER FIX THEIR CRAP, AND BEEN DOING SO FOR YEARS.  MotoGP14, MXGP, RIDE are all games awaiting patches, and none in sight.  And more important, don't buy MOTOGP15 that will be released soon.  They need to go bankrupt asap and stop ripping people.10/10 I would trade this 55$ crap for any 5$ game if I could.

												Ride Review - see under Ride discussionsAs a keen bike owner, racer & gamer, previously having played Super Bikes Riding Challenge, I am not very happy with Ride. I have done a more lengthy review of Ride which you can find under the Ride discussions where I have discussed only some of all the problems with this game. I have since also started a Ride protest page which reveals other peoples frustrations with this game under same, which most probably like all the others in my Steam unplayable games library, will most likely not be fixed. I strongly advise against buying this or other games on Steam until such time Steam are able to support them properly			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is unfinished, and from the looks of it will not be properly supported. despite my pc being above the ideal set up that they recomend, the game will not hold 30fps on the lowst settings and its framerate is all over the place, the physics that they claim are ""realistic/simulator quality"" feel like a joke compared to  that of old ps2 games, the front breaks never lock up even if you turn in fully and mash the breaks all the way.  then we get to the ai which is terible and lazy, they hardly holde a proper line and do not respect you, they will break late every corner and then some, and somehow be able to out accelrate you on the exit of every corner unless you use proper early breaking and early acceleration, (this is on the default easy setting in the first set of cups) the ability to change setups involvs using sliders which have arbitrary numbers between 1-5, never giving you enough values to properly tune the bikes to the course, and most of them fail to offer enough of a change even at max deviation compared to what they should provide. after looking up the game and its forum, I can clearly see that the developers will not support this game, nor do they care about its success and as such I can not recomend this to anyone.  if this was a early access game I might be willing to give this a wait until release, but, as its already out. skip it.

												WARNING!!!!!!!!Ride will delete your saved data at some point. It's guaranteed. The game autosaves, and you can't manually save. You can create a rider, play a quarter, maybe a half way through the season, and the next time you start the game, EVERYTHING will be lost. Like to start over from the beginning a hundred times? If so, this is the game for you. Otherwise, STAY AWAY!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Milestone set out to succeed playstation 2's Tourist Trophy as the modern motorcycle racing simulator. It however falls very short of that goal. Graphics are last generation quality that somehow taxes modern video cards. The only positive things I could say about the game is it's selection of bikes and gear. But it falls short from there. It feels very shallow and geared towards the casual gamer/racing fan. Short-comings in on track riding is what ruins the game the most. It is the same arcade style simulation (an oxymoron) engine as the previous MotoGP games. Trailbraking deep is ridiculous and offers no feedback when the front wheel is at it's limit. The reactions of the bike to too much throttle is the same for every bike. Turning into the first corner is always the same even if the race just started and the front tire is still ""cold"". Then there are the small missing details. No clutch lever use even on the older bikes. The throttle hand works but the brake lever is never used, never mind the rear brake pedal on the right foot. There are ZERO braking markers for non-track circuits. Only occasionally is there a reference point like a tree or a fence, but the rider is left with nothing to judge the approach most of the time.Then there's the ridiculously aggressive AI that has no qualms of ramming passed you because somehow collisions only penalize one bike. The AI will insist on it's line even if you're in front of it and worst of all will not brake if you plan on braking earlier than it. The AI is also on a very suboptimal line The set up of the game progression is obviously an afterthought to Milestone as there is NO QUALIFYING SESSION. YOU ARE ALWAYS 8TH. Leaving you with having to deal with the 7 AI-controlled bikes that will slow you down. Then there's the classification of the bikes into races. Some are beyond lazy such as grouping the MT07 with Ducati Monsters and Triumph Street triples because they are all below 700cc. WHAT?! That's a very ignorant way to classify a class race. The MT07 MAY have a corner speed advantage, but that advantage is completely blown away on circuits with straights. Why even bother having that bike? There was no beta testing for this game. Then there's the customization for looks and performance. The biggest mistake Milestone has in this area is completely ignoring the significance of a rear shock. The whole customization is an insult to any enthusiasts who love to customize their motorcycle's performance capability. Front forks are all stock upgrades. No chance of changing oil, springs, or even valves. Seat height, wheelbase, sprocket size, rotor size, handlebar vs clipons, removal of DOT required parts like lights. Milestone also only includes a very small amount of tracks despite having the license rights to the tracks in MotoGP15. None of those tracks appear in this game. Some tracks are ridiculously unfit for racing. Miami circuit being the most obvious because the street is too damn narrow . All in all RIDE is a game made by a casual company  meant for the casual gamer. If you want a game that shows the dedication to the sport like Tourist Trophy did for the Playstation 2, you will be very disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've probably sat here for a good few hours wondering whether to leave a positive or negative review. I think I've made my choice now.This game could of been so much more. I was so excited to play it on PC when I had a go at the Yamaha Demo at the MCN show in London. It was really looking good, but my heart sank when I purchased this at full price and recieved something I wasn't quite expecting. Pro's. -Really good customisation of Bike and Rider. -Pretty realistic movement.-Has quite a number of my favourite bikes. But I would lke to see some more earlier models.-Realistic Wheelies! (You don't pull wheelies by pulling on the handlebars like a bicycle.)-Stunning graphics and models.-Pretty awesome Multiplayer. Con's. -Only a few early models. Mostly generic modern bikes.-Only a handful of tracks.-Very random FPS drops that cause you to crash. (No, it's not my PC. My specs are on my profile.)-AI literally don't care. They just crash into you all the time.-Obvious signs of the game being unoptimized. (Laggy menu screen. Long loading times.)-Community pleads are ignored and unanswered.-Audio is pretty poor. (Lags when shifting gears up and down. Sometimes doesn't even play a sound, it's just ""Brruummm. -Silence.- Brrruuuummmmmm. -Silence.-"")-♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC. ""Yamaha Historical Bikes"" = R1, R1, R7. What happend to the FZR 750? Thundercat? FZR 1000? FZS 600? All in all, I really wish I could thumb it up. But it needs some serious patching, I feel like I'm playing a game in Early Access.

												As a motorcyclist and an absolute bike nut I love this game, but I've consistently gotten huge problems with the game crashing mid races, crashing when trying to set up an online race.If you can live through that then it's a great game and you'll love it.If you can't deal with that then you're gonna have a bad time.

												First of all the game looks nice. It presents a lot of options in terms of customization, but only just touches the surface in that area. The physics are below average. Bikes doesnt react to surroundings correctly, and the man himself desperately needs a ragdoll effect, which cant be that hard to make since we've seen that in lesser good games like Flatout, Flatout 2, Motocross game from 10-15 years ago. Milestone doesnt have any real competition on the Motorcycle game market and therefore do not feel the need to up their game at all. Same physics and controls as the last 2-3 MotoGP games. Poor network options - that rarely works, and when you succeed in connection to your friends, the game lags out and people disconnect with each other leaving you alone with bots.The WORST thing about MotoGP through ALL the years and now also RIDE is the quality of sound. Computer sounds, made by what obviously must be people who havent heard the real thing IN REAL LIFE. The sounds these machines make are worse than car games 15 years ago. You have the rights to MotoGP, you dont have any competition - GO out and record the ♥♥♥♥ing machines to deliver it to us when we game it. Most of the purchases unfortunately done of this game, is by people riding a motorcycle, so we KNOW the sounds. My first machine was a Yamaha MT07 with an IXIL exhaust on. That doesnt exist in the game but Akrapovic does. Its looooud like a beast with Akra on IRL - but ingame it sounds like the engine sound comes from an iPhone.Disgustingly bad :).If you can come to terms with having to mute your game, because having no sound will annoy you less than having the sound on?! - then its STILL almost a waste of money.Now RIDE 2 is on the way. People are ALREADY in the comments to RIDE's trailers and also RIDE 2's trailers writing ""WE WANT REAL SOUNDS"" - if they ignore us, us being the ones who pay for the damn thing, one more time.... i HOPE it will have consequences. Or at least give another studio the ide to start making Superbike or MotoGP bike games again!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												+ Lots of motorcycles to unlock+ Rider view and detailed dash+ Acceptable physics, good feeling+ Variety of categories and events+ 4 cylinder bikes sound decent+ Replay mode lets you take good screenshots+ Wheelie control can be turned off for more fun- Unrealistic amount of grip, even on grass- Many bikes aren't competitive in their category- Most 1, 2 and 3 cylinder bikes don't sound right- AI difficulty spikes- Minor visual odditiesThis game should be played with a controller. If you ride a motorcycle, if you are a motorcycle enthusiast or if you enjoyed the SBK/MotoGP games, you will enjoy this game. Just make sure your PC can handle it.There were reports about data losses, so keep your save files (%appdata%\Milestone\Ride) backed up!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is great but it keeps losing my data so i lose all of my rep this has happened twice to me. + The physics are good you can lose the front and you can highside so that keeps you on your toes not like tourist trophy. + The bikes feel like they have a weight to themn to pull them down to the apex requires some skill with no assists. + Allot of content I have around 30 bikes and have compleated about a quarter of the game in total not including losing my saves.+ There is a good amount of licenced parts for the bikes and for your riders gear.+ Runs well with everything at the highest and AA on x2 my 270x runs most tracks at 60fps and some like the road tracks I get around 50 avarage. The juddering from the demo is not in the final game. + AI is clever enough to make well thought out overtakes I have not once been t boned by a wild AI.- It deleted my data.- It did it again.- I'm not sure it will stand the test of time like Tourist Trophy but im sure if they added the TT mountain course then it would! Overall its a great game but the save issue needs to be sorted out ASAP.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Forza with bikes pretty much. A very nice feeling bike game, which is extremely rare to come by. Last enjoyable bike themed games have to be Tourist Trophy or Moto GP2, but this game has the ability to live up to those titles.Only trouble ,for me atleast, was picking the Yamaha MT07 as a start bike, as I found it a bit difficult to get off the ground due to the ai competitors being on faster bikes. Once I got round that though, I managed to get a good bike out of a decent lineup, and have a blat round a few of the tracks, which have really amazing design/quality. Will require a pretty powerful PC to run efficiently however.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wanted to like this game, but I can't. It has fundamental flaws that make it unenjoyable for me.This is a shame because the content (the tracks, bikes, music etc) is all really good. I also got decent enough performance (outside of the load times).The worst problem is the handling. I think I figured out what the main 'cause' is, and this seems systemic of all Milestone bike games I've played:The tyres float across the track. You can see this even when not moving. Just lean left and right and look at the back tyre, it glides right and left respectively across the surface of the track when it should remain in the same place. This effect only gets worse at higher speeds, with the tyres gliding left or right by almost a whole foot when leaning.This isn't just the contact patch moving to the side of the tyre, its the whole tyre sliding as if there is no contact patch, and its not a power slide (it happens all the time), and it seemingly affects all 'modes' (pro and the rest).Overall this make the bikes horrible to handle.It's like there is no physics between the tyre and the track surface, as if the pivot point when leaning is somewhere in the middle of the bike instead of at the contact patch of the tyres. This is absolutely not a 'simulation', it's an arcade game (and, imo, a very flawed one at that).Also, some of the rider animations/'physics' are super messed up (like a crazy 'superman' somersault your rider will do during endos).And annoyingly there appears to be no practice or quali sessions, so to practice new tracks you have to go to Time Trials, which involves going through a bunch of slow loading menu screens.The other issues I had are mainly UI related:- Terrible loading screens throughout the menus.- Split time between riders not shown in-game.- Best lap time not shown in game.- Being unable to change controls in-game (have to exit out to the main menu first).- Being unable to un-assign controller buttons (so nothing is mapped to it).- Being unable to assign multiple buttons to single actions.- Unnecessary confirmation screens, like having to click proceed instead of backing out after a race, or having to re-confirm your bike (when you select a race your bike is already chosen, then get a loading screen, then have to choose your bike again - even if you only have 1 bike, then get another loading screen).- Game trying to 'sync' and failing, causing an error message you have to confirm. You can switch 'sync' off, but it re-enables itself each time the game is restarted.- Having to manually re-purchase enhanced oil after every single race.- A second or two delay between model updating when changing visual stuff (like helmets, leathers, bike parts etc), making custimising a time consuming process.- Key prompts always being for keyboard keys, even when using a controller.Some of the above may seen like nit-picking, and it is, but each little inconvenience adds up.Maybe some of the above has fixes and I missed it, but if I did its not obvious to me where it is.A real shame. So close to being a great game, yet so far.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
