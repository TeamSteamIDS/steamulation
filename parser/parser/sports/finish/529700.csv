												finally TEW 2013 has found its way to Steam. I've played this game hundreds of hours before it was released on Steam.You run a wrestling company as either the owner or head booker and book the shows, sign wrestlers etc.Booking shows is as easy or as detailed as you want. You can let the AI book your shows or do it all on your own. There are basically no limits, pretty much anything you can think of can be done. You can also create your own Match types or angles.The default fantasy database that comes with the game is pretty good, a lot of people prefer it over real world databases. Speaking of real world databases: there are lots of top notch fan created mods available on the official forum: http://www.greydogsoftware.com/forum/showthread.php?t=525274So yeah, from someone who played every TEW game and also it's predecessor EWR: this game is highly recommended if you're looking for a quality wrestling managing game.

												Ive been playing these for many years and they are fantastic.  Some of the most in-depth simulation games to date.The learning curve is steep though, and this is certainly a niche game.  Hardcore simulation fans that like the business end of wreslting will find it amazing, the casual gamer will immediately refund it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
