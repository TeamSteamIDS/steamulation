Early Access Review
								I watched a lot of football this season so this was a nice fix for me. It was even a little addicting, for a VR game at least. It's one of the few games I actually went back to to have ""fun"" and not just record another YouTube video. I can't wait until the Vive has glove-like accessories where it feels like you're actually palming a football. The modes are few and simple but it's still really fun. You can throw spirals based on when you release the ball, so it seems. The price is about right I'd say as well. I recommend it to any football fan since there are pretty much no football related VR games out there. My overview:
