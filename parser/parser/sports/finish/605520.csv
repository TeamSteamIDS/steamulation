												    Let's start with the presentation. It's garbage.    Character models look like pre-made assets, animations and sound effects are very artificial, and the flashing LED colors get harder to look at the more you look at them. There are also these strange transitions that cut the music when you navigate through the main menu, pause during levels, and when you die.    The gameplay is incompetent, too. Compared to something like Geometry Dash, which this game is imitating by the way, your hitbox is so thin that it makes precise platforming less forgiving than it should be. Also, Geometry Dash at least gives you the occasional moment to stop and breathe during stages. But here, you don't get one of those. Even after checkpoints. With these two aspects combined, as well as the previously mentioned flashing colors, just retrying levels gets tiring fast.    But hey. At least this game has official controller support...ONLY when you're jumping! I tried every button besides A on my controller, and none of them worked. Playing on a keyboard and mouse is at least functional, but    The final nail in the coffin is the nonexistent replay value. You get 40 levels to go through in this game. That's it. No collectibles, no cosmetic options, no multiplayer or extra modes, and you can get all the achievements just by beating the entire game normally.    I highly recommend that you stay away from this game as much as you can. Even at the low price of 99 cents, I felt ripped off by this. How did it get past Steam Greenlight? HOW??? ",15,2,0,2,0,0,0

												it's a sausage that wants to survive and not to get in hotdog. it's pretty fun and frustrating at the same time, all you do is click to jump as the sausage runs by itself. Can't go wrong for the price!			",118,13,3,15,10,2,7

												I love this game. Its the best game ever played. Wish more levels their where. Got this from a friend. Wow this is bright. What is my life. This game gave me hepatitis C. I also might be deaf in one ear. that might be the sausage trying to escape from his box of color though. Legit this game is meh, Click controlls suck should have been space or the up arrow or even W would have worked. Game is way to bright and it really hurts my hepatitis C that i recently got after playing this game. kidding but im not. this game is just not really optimized i guess... Click controlls to many really bright colors it honestly hurt my eyes.Side note What the ♥♥♥♥ is hepititis Im going to google that now.Sider noteHepatitis C is an inflammation of the liver due to a viral infection. So now we all learned something today.			",28,5,0,3,2,0,8

												Fast pased platformer game where you are playing for a running sausage that need to avoid obstacles to pass the levels. Game is rather fast, you should be very precise - as when you jump to early - you fail, when you jump too late - you fail. when you fail you start again, but - the game knows its not quite easy, so it counts attempts for you (i stopped after 100 failed attempts) and you does not need to start a level from a very beginning, just from some checkpoint close to the place where you failed.Pretty playable, bright and colourful levels design, funny sausage character, quite not expensive - why don't try?
