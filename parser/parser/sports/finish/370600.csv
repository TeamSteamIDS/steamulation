												Have you ever dated a person for a really long time?  Like, since 1992?  Maybe their name was something like, Mario Kart?  And you and Mario Kart got along fine, sometimes you'd argue, sometimes they would drag you to a movie you didn't want to see, maybe you didn't love their taste in music, but things were ok, right?  But, you've been dating for twenty three years at this point.  Maybe you start to hate the way they laugh, the way they cough, the way they don't put the cap back on the toothpaste.  Maybe you hate how Mario Kart can never decide what to have for dinner.  And all these little things start to build up in your mind, they start gnawing away at you.  And maybe one day you meet another person you think is kind of cute.  And you end up leaving Mario Kart for this new person, maybe their name is something like Hello Kitty and Sanrio Friends Racing.Mario Kart doesn't even get mad at you, they don't throw your stuff out of the window, they just look sad and disappointed as you walk out the door.But after you spend one day with your new partner, you realize what a terrible mistake you've made.  Hello Kitty isn't charming or clever.  Hello Kitty doesn't get your jokes, they don't seem to have any sense of humor at all.  Hello Kitty falls asleep in your bed, then immediately begins to fart and pick their nose in their sleep.  Hello Kitty only ever wants to eat at Applebee's.  Hello Kitty believes in Bigfoot and says incredibly racist things when your friends are over.  Hello Kitty hasn't read a book since high school, and has no opinion on any current event, other than thinking Donald Trump would make a really good President.  Hello Kitty might have looked cute, back when they were just something you daydreamed about when you were with Mario Kart, but after just one day you realize that Mario Kart was the best thing that ever happened to you.  Mario Kart understood you, and loved you, and you walked out on them for... for _this_.  You threw away the only good thing you had in your life for someone who has innumerable clipping errors and someone who has no quit option beyond pressing Alt+F4.  You threw away the best kart racing game for the worst.  And as you sit there on the foot of your bed, smoking a cigarette at 3 AM, staring into the darkness, you realize what a fool you are, as Hello Kitty farts loudly under the sheets.You know Mario Kart will take you back, they will forgive you.  But deep down, you also know that you no longer deserve them.			",1074,410,34,118,106,13,136

												Hello Kitty and Sanrio Friends is a racing party game developed by Scarab Entertainment releasing on Steam in July 2015. Let me first point out that I have no interest in the Hello Kitty franchise (thankfully) so went into this game purely as an outsider wanting a casual kart racing experience. Game play for Hello Kitty is extremely basic compared to other kart racing games. There are only three buttons you need to use, accelerate, turning and your ability button. I expected the gameplay to be simple given that Hello Kitty SHOULD be aimed at the younger audience so I can’t fault the simplicity of the game at all.  I played the game purely as a multiplayer experience as that is all I want out of a casual racing game like this. I think if I was to play this game solo I would not have had anywhere near as much fun as I did playing with my partner.Graphically the game is again, very basic. No real amazing graphics on show. There is a little laziness when it comes to textures and general modelling. Some of the carts wheels will be sunk into the earth as they don’t align with the ground properly, just little things that mount up to make the game not look as crisp as it should.  There is very little in terms of animations, the characters are pretty much static the whole time and the only movement you get is when you activate abilities and even then it is very minimal.  The soundtrack…oh god the sound track. It is quite simply the most upbeat music you will hear. It had me and my partner having a rave with the subwoofer turned all the way up. The sound effects are nothing to rave about though, just very generic samey sounds. Hello Kitty is not a hard game by any stretch of the imagination. I came first in every race we played in without having any difficulty. I mean, you get an achievement just from launching the game… My partner on the other hand was not so lucky; I will touch on why in the technical section of the review.  There are 16 courses to play through, and 90% of them are all extremely short. You can complete your three laps in less than three minutes sometimes.  Whilst there is a bit of variety to be seen between the courses, you do get the feeling that it is the same map just in reverse sometimes. The environments are varied to a good degree so it is not glaringly obvious. As this is party game, you do get plenty of replay ability and you will probably not want to play this game on your own. The fun of this game certainly comes out when there are more than you. We have played for over an hour so far and feel like we’ve had our hit of it, will we play it again? Possibly, it is certainly going to be a game I keep installed on my hard drive so we can play it again when we have friends over. Technically we ran into a few problems, first of all as I mentioned above my partner had a number of issues which made playing the game more troublesome than I did. The main issue was that the controls are not responsive for anyone but player 1. You can move fine, but as soon as you want to use your ability, the game will just ignore the input. Secondly, the menus are EXTREAMLY hard to navigate and even harder to actually get into a game. If a child were to play this game, they would simply not have any idea how to get around the menus and play this game; we had plenty of problems even getting it to work. To sum up, Hello Kitty and Sanrio Friends Racing is a poorly executed game that you will only get some enjoyment out of when playing with more than one person. The poor controller issues and bland graphics don’t do the game any favours, but as with all party games, you tend to have more fun poking fun at your friends messing up in the game rather than the game itself.  Sadly the game is priced extremely high for the production values on show, £14,99 is way way too high to even consider this a worthy purchase. If you can get it for less than £3, sure it’ll be worth it just for the comical value, but other than that, stay away.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

												What is there to say about this lovable, hello kitty themed racer. Other than it is an unfinished game? There are several incomplete maps,  with textures jutting out from side to side the water doesnt even touch the walls of the map so there are just gaps, your racer is constantly being drowned by water. They are selling this for $20 keep that in mind. Are you familiar with other games being sold for the same price? like Fallout 3 and New Vegas GOTY for the same price. Now enough of the textures, we can forgive that, its a kid game, kids dont know quality from crummy. How about the AI, is the game challenging? Well to answer that no. Most of the maps the computers just get stuck to a wall and stop moving. Alright whatever you want some easy wins that's fine! Now lets review the carts, I have played every single one of them and I honestly cant tell the difference in any of them. Pretty much as long as you hold the gas pedal and turn you will win, no need to break no need for power sliding, thats it. The music, the sounds in the game were lackluster, if stock audio existed this game features it, and you will most likely only get two items while playing this Cones or Cupcakes, Cones being the equivilent of a banana, or cupcakes which are reminiscent of green shells that cant bounce off walls. You will only get two items because you will always be in first place. Seriously it is nearly impossible to be in any other place unless you go backwards. I am sure there are other items i've just never gotten one before.Some of you might be interested in the achievements, I know I was excited for them. Spoiler they are all as unrewarding and unfulfiliing as you might expect. 90% come from finishing adventure mode, which you complete by collecting 99 apples within a timelimit, sounds riviting right? Others include starting the game pretty difficult I know and the infamous ""Everything is better with Friends"" Which is achieved by completing local multiplayer, I have a active discussion thread if you want to check out the details on that atrocity. A great aspect about the game is after launching it you cannot change the settings, you have to EXIT THE GAME in order to configure controls or graphic settings. Why is this a thing? I spammed all of my friends with ""The Hulk 10.25"" Huge Dong Flesh is now playing Hello Kitty and Sanrio Friends Racing""  just trying to figure out how the hell to play this game. Sure that might seem like a conclusive major problem but it gets worse.... oh does it get worse.You better finish this game in one setting because if not you will lose almost all your progress. Yeah, not like you will be playing it twice since there is no replay value, all the stages are almost identical without any creative tracks. This game will last about an hour and a half, the reason for the extra 1.2 hours was trying to configure controls for the local multiplayer. (Good luck on that one)I could go on and on about mechanics and maps but I know none of you are going to read this entirely through, for the tl;dr this is an incomplete game that is actually liscensed by a franchise that has made BILLIONS in profit. The development team has said they are ""looking into problems"" however no work has been put forth. Unless this title sees a major decrease in cost don't buy it. I tried getting my little cousin to play this game, but she walked out after one race.			",71,2,2,13,5,1,7

												I've decided this is aimed at children due to the simplicity and the ease of the gameplay.  Having said that, one of the things that frustrates me is ""partial controller support"".  This game makes a fine example of this.  Creating a new race requires going back and forwards between gamepad and mouse, seemingly having to use a different input method to configure different parts of the race.  Not perfect for children.The game itself isn't awful but there are some annoyances.  The cars do move at a slow pace and are easy and responsive to drive.  The AI of the opponents leaves a bit to be desired.  The first thing I noticed on my first race was the lack of any shadow from the vehicles, the game was zipping along at 700-800fps so I'm sure a few shadows wouldn't have had much of a performance impact.The biggest crime this game commits is that has no online multiplayer mode.  I presumed (my bad!) that I'd be able to race against friends online but it is local co-op only.The devs forgot to put in an option to quit out of the game when you're done.  This is just sloppy.  So you're gonna need to use task manager to exit or use some other ghetto method.You get to use three different vehicle :- Cars, boats and planes.  The planes are actually quite fun to fly!   When the boats go around a sharp corner the sound effect is of car tyres screeching...IF they patched the game to fix a few of the shortcomings and added an online mode I'd be able to give this a tentative recommendation, in its current state the asking price that it is being sold for is an insult.I can only conclude this is a mobile port that received no effort to make it a good experience on PC.

												First of all, yes, I know this game is made for little kids but after everything I experienced in the game (and out), I can not give this game a positive review.The vehicles in the game, while varied, all feel awkward in the worst ways. Cars grip the road too tightly (and wheels clip through the floor), Boats are way too floaty making challenges involving them much harder than necessary, and Planes move fairly well with a controller but makes weapon powerups mostly useless.Powerups in the game in general are a mix of too weak or overpowered. Each powerup is the usual Mario Kart-esque powerups you tend to see in kart racers, green shells, mushrooms, bullet bill, banana, and lightning bolt. The Lightening Bolt, Shells, and Banana powers are fairly weak and don't help give as much of an advantage as the speed boosts given by the other items and on a 3d plane with the... plane, dodging non-homing weapons is too easy making those powerups completely useless.The game also offers controller compatibility, well, kind of. To use controller, you must turn on Gamepad controls in the settings, the issue with this is that the controller works in races but barely works on the menu screens, sometimes working, sometimes half working, sometimes not at all. The bigger issue with this is the fact that the game looks like it might have been ported almost directly from a console version as all the menu's show Wii-esque ""Press B to go back""  messages. Feels like a lazy port to me especially when my first completion of a tour was not actually saved in the game.Stages are also a concern in my opinion. For a kid's kart racer there are a lot of twists and turns which is not a concern to me but the fact that they had the chance to use nice popping colors for a Hello Kity but instead make everything look bland, and in one case hard to tell which was the race path, an opportunity was missed there. Another missed opportunity is the fact that one of the first stages has a waterfall that pushes everyone towards a wall to show off the possibility of physics in the game, albeit it is not very clear that the waterfall is doing it and it just feels like the rocks are magnetized, they don't ever use the physics creatively again. Even the ice in winter levels doesn't feel like ice. Also there are again issues with clipping everywhere, the cars in general tends to clip their wheels through the ground but most starting lines and speed boost pads float above the ground.The difficulty curves based on tours in the game, or rather that is what it is supposed to do. Each tour is like the next step in difficult AI drivers. Problem is that the final tour which should be the hardest ended up being the easiest due to glitches. On 1 stage, one of the AI continuously drove in circles near the finish line which also was a map with very hard to dodge iceberg obstacles but what was worse was that on another stage, the road had a very large invisible wall that stopped every racer, once you figure out where the invisible wall ends, the final race of the game ....is against no one. I finished the entire race before any of the AI finished 1 lap because they were trapped.And my final complaint about this game...I uploaded 7+ screenshots of my gameplay. Of these screenshots, the 3 screenshots of actual in game gameplay and not just Huds/Menus were flagged by Valve and caused me to receive a 3 day ban from posting to the community. Hello Kitty screenshots got me temprarily banned from uploading screenshots.This game is not worth even $5.P.S. There is no button to exit the game.			",3487,1328,137,337,465,38,476

												I've always been a fan of Hello Kitty and I was excited to see this game up on Steam. I did read some negative reviews but decided to purchase the game anyway. As much as I love Kitty, I regret purchasing the game.The biggest issue for me is that the game will not save. Whenever I shut down the game and load it back up later, nothing I ""unlocked"" is still unlocked. The cars are relocked and so are the characters. It's as if the game isn't saving anything. What's the point of a game if our ""progress"" is going to be reset every time we close down the game? It makes the game a waste of the money I spent on it. It upsets me honestly.The game overall is decent. It's a fun little game, almost like Mario Kart but with Hello Kitty characters. The controls for the boats and planes can be a bit wonky but as you get used to them, it becomes a lot of better.I would have given this game a recommendation but seeing as how my progress has been reset twice already, I can't rightfully recommend this game until that is fixed and updated. There is also no button to exit the game. It has to be done manually which isn't too big of a deal but is still a bit iffy.			",3,5,1,2,2,0,0

												It's pretty obvious that there wasn't any testing done on this game and they just wanted to fire it out as quick and cheaply as possible. There are 16 tracks spread across 4 cup events as well as 20 skill events to complete a lap quickly or collect items with the entire game being completable in around an hour. The racing takes place in karts, boats and planes depending on the selected race. Although this game seems to be aimed at a slightly younger audience, you can get Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed for the same price and it's a much higher quality product.Positives:+Bright and colorful tracks+Many characters and vehicles to unlock+Catch up mechanic helps keep the races close if the player falls behindNegatives-AI gets stuck or lost in every race-Tracks and assets are reused frequently -Massive invisible wall in the middle of one of the tracks-Controller support is intermittent and doesn't work properly in the menus-tons of clipping issues-objects and vehicles can appear above or below the track instead of on it			",1129,292,53,138,120,21,148

												My 8 year old daughter likes this game and we have fun playing it together, but good gosh what a lazy port. The controllers work in-game most of the time but using them or even the mouse on menu screens is hit-and-miss and ... THERE'S NO WAY TO EXIT THE GAME short of alt-tabbing out and then right clicking on the taskbar!If you want to charge £15 for a game then the very least you can do is make sure we can navigate the menus, choose characters without guess-work and then leave the game when we want to. Very very shoddy and lazy.I'd recommend it for kids except they'll get frustrated with the menus not working properly. Fix that and you can have a thumbs up.			",107,15,16,5,3,0,2

												A generic kart racer that is outclassed by almost every game in its genre. Its status as a Hello Kitty game gives it a bit of novelty, but the loose controls and sparse content will bore you very quickly. Want to see more?

												Let me just start by saying that I really wanted to like this game. I really did. However, the difficulty of the AI (easy), the ambiguity of the controls (I had to use the opening Unity dialog to figure them out, which I've never had to do before), the poor controlling (you press a button and it takes you, like, 10 minutes to turn) and even the lack of an exit button (I mean, really, come on guys) lead me to dislike this.Hey, at least the game's kawaii. It has that going for it.			",2704,1050,91,278,376,30,369

			here is the review for this game on steam http://steamcommunity.com/id/blinkdoggie/recommended/370600		

2/10 broken but good for lolzThis is a not so great Mario kart like racing game. not sure what that is?You do laps on a race track and collect power-ups to help you or hinder your opponents.The game has 3 modes of play, adventures: where you collect apples, go though hoops, or do a fast lap, contests: where you play 1 of 4 sets of chosen maps and the player with the most points after the last race wins, & free play: here you can play any of the levels in contest by its self.It has 1-4 player in local co-op and you can play as hello kitty or 9 other friends to race in cars, boats, or planes with 10 different models for each to play in 16 levels (some of the plane ones are reused cart ones).With powerups like cones (place on track or drag behind you), cupcakes (shoot at other racers or drag behind you), stopwatch (slow other racers), rainbows (super boost&maybe invincibility), boosts (3 small or 1 big), & a shield. The games not very hard and there are a few bugs like objects being a bit off the ground, your boat taking on water, and some levels the ai will get lost.It's not worth $20 and only good as a joke as i feel only a small child, being drunk, a youtuber, or a die hard hello kitty fan could enjoy this.

												The game is fun in short bursts if you don't take it seriously, it's obviously a cute & light-hearted racing game for kids & presents itself well as such, but gameplay is just buggy & lacking when you get down to it.Nothing particularly innovative and it doesn't even do the stuff it does well.AI dumb as bricks. There's easymode for kids and then there's whatever this is.The AI doesn't cut corners or seem to ease off the acceleration at all for turning so it's very easy to just pass them in the first 1/4 lap. AI frequently gets stuck on random parts of the map.eg: In a boat level I played, Hello Kitty ran into a wall from overacceleration and then started going backwards for 1/3 of a circuit until she got stuck in a corner for the rest of the race. She didn't complete a single lap. The dog, Purin, in 10th JUST STOPPED MOVING in the middle of the course after its first lap. http://i.imgur.com/RC1wC1E.pngYet somehow, despite me being first the entire race, Purin has a lap time ~20s faster, and HK inexplicably came in 2nd despite never finishing a single lap.The scoring system is remarkably bogus.Another race: http://i.imgur.com/KBNGkzG.jpgAI stuck on a hill since the first lap.While you can turn on controller/gamepad support within the game, analog stick/dpad doesn't work for menus.No exit button to close the game as other people mentioned.Powerups don't overwrite if you have one picked up already. Particularly frustrating if you get the 3-shot cupcake equivalent of green koopa shells.Boat controls in particular are pretty floaty but the car handling wasn't terrible.By no means worth 20 bucks.

												This could be OK rally game for younger children, or Hello kitty fans. Unfortunately it falls short on execution. The key bindings has to be done outside the game and adjusting them just right is a bit of a proble.Actually it is impossible to get them way I wanted because accelerlation and brake can't be adjusted on Joystick axis.It means that, yes I can play with my driving wheel. And no, I can't use the peddals. And this is huge problem, since kids would love to steer with a wheel, but using buttons for going forwards is a bit hard task to do. If the driving wheel could be completely supported I would give thumbs up. No it falls a bit short and it's thumbs down. - and obviously this is only for children. If you are looking for serious driving game, this obviously isn't for you.			",332,111,29,52,91,13,80

												I wanted to really like this game...really wanted to. The graphics and game play are what you would expect for the targeted age group. There are issues with the envrionment graphics, however, as you can ghost into walls while driving and the boats, especially, don't always drive/float above the track/water. Interestingly, this does not seem to affect gameplay. My biggest gripe, however, is the horrible controls with a keyboard. The boats and planes taking a second to turn is understandable and more realistic but make it near impossible to complete some of the addtional challenges. No matter how the keys were defined, I was unable to use any power-ups or protections. This last part was not as much of a hinderance since the AI is targeted to a younger demographic and it is possible to finish with the maximum number of points by simply flying/driving smart.I received this game as part of a bundle. If I had not, I would be displeased with its purchase. Once the keyboard issues are solved, I would recommend this game to any casual racer. Until then, I can see this causing frustration.

												I liked the game, but I managed to get it for $2.00.The controls could use some work. There are tracks that are bad enough to get the a.i. stuck or going in the wrong direction. There's no online multiplayer. There's only 4 cups with 4 tracks per cup. There's only one difficulty. The menus have bad controls, sometimes you can use your controller, sometimes you can't. Considering the base price is $20, its a better idea to buy Sonic and All Stars Transformed. ",1216,364,66,167,107,11,151

The game simply looks adorable and was a lot of fun to 100% =3*click more info to read more about review and check out some screenshots*Maps, Customization and more!- You can outfit the characters with different clothing styles!- There are different rides (boats/planes/cars) to pick from and you can even change those colors as well. Really makes it a unique experience!There are 4 tours that I can so far play.4 Maps that are available and what you can use on the map as follows.* Hello Kitty's Happy Town- Cars* Chococat's Tropical Island- Boats* Little Twin Stars Galaxy- Planes* My Melody's Ski Resort- CarsThe game also has an [Adventure Mode] thats a series of mini games on the original main maps. In this mode you do a lot of fun things like race through a time countdown while collecting cupcakes or apples. Sometimes  your task is going through as many hello kitty gates before time runs out. You are challenged to do these things on different maps and different vehicles as those I listed earlier.


Adventure mode. One of the games is to collect all 99 apples before time runs out but if you collect most of them you still win.

- The controls feel alright, there isn't any difficult and its the usual WSD format.I recommend controller since I found it more fun and simpler but either way its still easy to control.


My 1st race! Controls are easy, learning the map and its advantages and using them in your favor is another thing.

- Maps are really cute and also simple to maneuver on and learn.


You can pick up random items and boosts in order to help you stay ahead in the race!

- Graphics in the game are not amazing but are cute. Nothing high end. - Music in the game was alright. Side NotesI am not a crazy cat person or anything but was so excited for its launch that I was almost crying! Finally Hello Kitty is on steam! Am in love <3Just got 100% on this game after 2.1hrs I had to plug in my controller which made it even more fun and even more easier for me.My Final thoughtsIn the end I feel the game isn't polished enough to be worth $20 so I recommend picking up this game while it is on sale. I would of expected this game to be worth $10-$15 maxA must get for Hello Kitty fans! #Cats4Life			",1036,432,37,88,124,11,111

												Even though I'm an adult, I can still enjoy childrens games. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy this one due to the lack of difficulty.What I liked Graphics are fun and colorful.  You have several vehicles depending on what race you drive. Boats, cars and planes. You can also choose what color you likeNeutral  The music is fun and bouncy, but after a while it sounds very samey.  The tracks are quite short and just like the music, feels quite the same in regards to design.   A minor petpeeve of mine, but the result board lies about when the AI finishes the game. They are always listed 3 seconds behind you, even if you are ahead of them by at least 30. The airplane stages get a bit tedious, because there's no indication of when the plane hits a wall. Sometimes you can be quite far from them and it still counts as bumping in to them.  The game feels like a poor Mario Kart look a like. Even the item boxes look the same (question marked hidden in a rainbow box). There's only a few items though.What I disliked From what I could gather from my gameplay, there's no difficulty setting. This is my biggest gripe with the game, because the AI drive slower than you. Unlike Mario Kart where the other players will at least sometimes catch up to you due to the bungeecord effect, in this game you end up catching up with the AI who are still on the previous lap. I see no reason to leave out difficulty, I played Mario Kart on the SNES when I was just 7 years old. If the only setting on that game was easy, I am sure it would have flopped. No option to exit the game. I had to Alt + F4 to get it to close. No voice acting or any emoting from the characters.  The rainbow stages. My eyes hurt after playing them.  Only partial controls. You can drive with the joystick, but can only select the tracks and game mode with the mouse. ",172,366,6,57,34,3,40

												I'm the biggest Hello Kitty fan I know and even I didn't buy that game but got it as a gift.Better don't buy it if you want a proper, functioning game. If you need Hello Kitty eye candy on Steam - this game is for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This racer is easy, very easy, way toooOOoooo easy.  Perfect for kids though any normal gamer will get real bored real fast.  Music is awesome with real colorful worlds and a variety of racing types from car races, boats, and airplanes.  There are diff modes from getting cupcakes to time trials but their all very very simple. This game could have been great for all players with 2 simple fixes.  Adding a difficulty setting, and adding online racing.  Without those there is no challenge for regular gamers.  Controller support is wonky, works in some menus while not in other menus.Rating For Childrens:  10/10  Value:  $9.99Rating For Everyone:  01/10  Value:  $0.99			",2654,1119,101,266,362,29,398

												As someone who has three-starred all the challenges under the ""Adventures with Sanrio Friends,"" I have to say this is one perfectly designed game! The game itself, while coming off as something that should be played by a child, is actually a true work of art. The game is challenging, and not due to the fact the controls are sticky and unresponsive at times. I believe the proper placement of apples, cupcakes, or rings are what truly defines the difficulty of this game. While you played Dota 2, wasted your time on League of Legends, I three-starred the challenges in Hello Kitty and Sanrio Friends Racing. --Do reccomend. Pick this up, you will not regret throwing a Andrew Jackson at the screen.			",76,15,3,10,6,0,3

			Views: 13		

			Rev up your motors for 'Hello Kitty and Sanrio Friends Racing' and put the pedal to the moderately slow metal.		

I know very little about Hello Kitty and the Sanrio associates, but I do know kart racing games.  This game has a lot bugs that weaken the product and the basic kart feel is slow and plodding.This might be a game for children.			",1292,572,45,182,173,17,247

												For such a racing archcasual as I am, this game is exactly what I need: simple, fun & easy. Must admit that it is somewhat underdeveloped (and probably never be improved), but it is still playable and enjoyable. I don't regret time spent on it.			",252,119,7,36,19,4,38

												I was rather surpirsed that there was an upcoming Hello Kitty game whilst surfing the ""upcoming releases"" section. This game is very simple but yet very fun. You can do single races and tournaments worth of 4 races each, variety of quests, characters and options for costumes/accessories for them which is very cute. As you proceed in the game, the more you unlock. Great thing about this game is that you can play up to 4 players but with those in front of your screen. So far, this game overall is wonderful and is a must get for those who love racing games like Mario Kart or Sonic Transformed, Hello Kitty fans or those who just like anything cute :3Hopefully the game gets more content and updates in the future as it would be nice if there was an online mode, story mode, maybe a CG Gallery worth of images to unlock too, trading cards/emoticons for the Steam Market and possibly a save button since I don't think there is one.. xDOverall, I really like the game the way it is right now and for a first day release, I am amazed that there are barely any bugs or issues except that player 2 choosing in multiplayer doesn't seem to work as in... we got the character but no confirm button for player 2 :( oh well :3			",166,58,7,17,21,2,15

												This game is a little slow paced compared to Call of Duty and other FPS's, but this game is by far the best military simulator with extremely large maps and a huge variety of vehicles and weapons to choose from. Singleplayer is not so great but all of the fun and action comes from the co-op missions online. You won't get anywhere in this game without an organized team which is one of the many reasons why this game is so fun. Highly recommended. Blows any competition out of the water (Op Flashpoint: Dragon Rising, CoD, MoH, etc.).			",49,1,1,4,2,0,1

												its hard to review this game and give the right thumb.The Game makes realy fun, its a bit like playing mario kart on a pc in hello kitty and friend style.The levels are lovely done but sadly mostly the same in all 4 stages. only a bit changes, some times you can drive with a car or fly with a plane or use a boat. there are 2 typed of gameplay, race agains computer or local friends and collecting cakes or other challanges without other players.The other site, the boring one is, this Game has a lot of glitches and a gamebreaking bug on stage 4 lap 4. Controller also don`t realy work. (xbox360)A lot of things on the map looks like they would fly, what is realy sad because it makes the game realy ugly and no one like to drive on a glitchy bugged map.Computer Players are realy dumb, they race agains walls and cant turn back or try to finish the race, they also race sometimes on the wrong way.For me the game was also a bit too easy, no real challange again computer, no way to change from easy to hard or like on mario kart from 50 to 150. You only can clear Stage 1-4 but its always the same grad.For 20€ the game is overpriced as hell, I bought it on a groupees bundle for 2$ amd that was a worth price for me, i dont know if I would pay more then 5$. Maybe if it had an online Multiplayer and not only up to 4 player local multiplayer.I rate this game 50 from 100, I give it a thumbs up because it can make fun for a short time and with friends or family at home, also i realy love Hello Kitty :)Pro:- nice graphic- up to 4 player coop (only local)- playes like mario cart on easy - hello kitty and friends- its on PC and runs good on Win10- maps looks funny - funny cars, plains and boatsCon:- No Online Multiplayer- Xbox360 Controller doesn`t work good so that you still need your mouse- too buggy with a game breaking bug- too easy, no mode to change from easy to hard or normal- levels are often the same they only change with what you can drive- computer player are broken or realy stupid- too expensive for 20€, maximum should be like 5-10€			",2141,1017,108,240,350,29,298
