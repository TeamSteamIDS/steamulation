												If you like Surgeon Simulator, or QWOP for that matter, then perhaps this game is for you. Not for the impatient, this game has you using several keys to align and aim a shot, nock an arrow, and ""attempt"" to hit a target. Simple concept, not easy to execute. If you're willing to sit for a bit twiddling around your keyboard then maybe you'd be able to get the controls to at least shoot after about a half hour. When your patience runs as thin as mine, you'll find yourself rather frustrated rather than entertained. For those who can perform a fun run of QWOP, then go for this game because I'm sure if you can get that down, this should be a piece of cake. If you're impatient, skip it. Now excuse me while I bang the last ten minutes out of my head by smashing my head on my desk repetitively. 1/10			",165,106,8,26,37,3,19

												This game- can make you beat the cr*p out of your computer. it's an awkward FPS. And if you think the game is easy, well, it isn't. You have to manipulate you wrists, shoulders and elbows (and shoot, obviously).  Although the game becomes easier once the commands are mastered and lacks replay value, Probably Archery is effective in achieving its goal: applying a cumbersome control scheme to a skill-based shooter.  PA features a lot variety of gamemodes (including shooting a horde of muscular apple-headed men running towards you,training mode,some multiplayer gamemodes,etc). Once you master the controls a bit, you can find the game quite funny.7/10			",201,40,8,11,12,1,10

												Probably Archery is just that, a game about archery. It seems like it's some sort of simulation, but I'm not quite sure. The controls take some getting used to, and hitting targets takes a lot of practice. The key element, fun, is missing here. There's no fun to be had, and it's all thanks to the controls. The controls are so awkward and unnatural that it takes longer to hit a target than it should. The graphics look fine for an archery game but they won't blow anyone away.I personally expected a more casual experience here, but I guess I should've known better. If you don't shy away from difficult games, then this might just be for you.[Rating: 55/100]			",1658,633,69,221,194,16,225

												Tried to shoot a target. Shot through the air instead. Tried to nock my arrow..the arrow ended up on the wrong side of the bow (making aiming impossible). Tried to shoot an apple off a guys head while he was sucking down liquid bravery....I killed he and his cronies...never quite killed the apple. Tried to eliminate a flying egg infestation....knocked over a table, destroyed a bunch of china, got three of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s! I then got hacked up by a warrior before I could nock an arrow. Hence the Probably in the Probably Archery title. You probably can do it....if you practice, practice, practice, lol. Try not to hurt yourself in the process.One of a number of games that feature wrist, elbow, and shoulder controls or the like (Surgeon Simulator and Ampu-tea are a couple other titles like this). So, it can be frustrating, but the results are better when you fail miserably lol. I intend to keep letting the arrows fly.Yet to be rated. Probably ends up a solid quiver full of arrows with a few broken shafts.			",2039,1022,52,316,205,18,280

												I'm sad other reviewers don't recommend it due its difficulty. If you buy an archery game and you mean only to shoot arrows like you do in Skyrim, TF2, etc, then archery isn't for you, don't buy it.This is an archery game where you take control of every single move you make:Left upper armLeft forearmLeft fistRight upper armRight forearmRight fistYou take an arrow, put it on the bow, aim and shoot, simple as that but it isn't simple.It's like Surgeon Simulator, I'm a bread, QWOP, Octodad but with bows and arrows.PROS+ Kinda unique+ Fun+ Hard, but not THAT hard.+ Nice theme (well, I've always liked archery)+ Various game modesCONS+ Bad models, you aren't even a person :/+ Takes some time to fully understand how to properly control it.+ Not taken very seriously, it had potential.It isn't great but it isn't bad either, I liked it, it's a casual game 7/10			",643,125,29,70,59,8,47

												I was challenged to play this game for at least 15 minutes and then write a review. Well, after 15 minutes I still couldn’t effectively draw an arrow, knock it and successfully shoot it anywhere near the target. The controls are like trying to sew a button onto a silk shirt with square hands. This game has your hands all over the keyboard.  So I moved onto another mode after failing at target practice. I found 10 modes, such as; the berserker, Noose, Zombie Soccer, and more. Since I never could master nocking an arrow and aiming, I certainly couldn’t play any of these panic style modes.  I wanted to write a witty review for this game, but I just want to be done and far away from it. 3/10, would SteamTroll			",117,20,4,11,6,1,9

												This game is absolutely zany.  I'd recommend this for people who like to tinker or concentrate *REALLY* hard on playing a game well.It's an archery simulation from a FPS view, where you have individual control of each of the shooter's arm joints.  You can only control either left or right wrist/elbow/shoulder at a time, not simultaneously.At first, it is confusing as hell.  Then shortly after, it becomes a little sensible but still extremely difficult to control.  With time you can learn to shoot rushing bad guys, moving targets, or even cut a rope from a person who is about to be hanged, Robin Hood style.Check out a few videos, like this, before you purchase.

												MY GOD THIS GAME! It took me almost two freaking hours to complete target practice, eight simple still targets. I can't even think about ADVANCED targets where they actually move around. The controls are god awful, half the time you're struggling to nock the friggin arrow because even though my hand is right on the string it says my arrow is too far to nock, because apparently your balloon head can't send the appropriate brain signals to your sack of potato body to complete a simple task! Then if you miss (witch you will, many many times) it's such a pain in the butt to draw your arrow and line your arms up correctly, and make a sad attempt at shooting. I could keeping going on on how bad the controls are but, for the sake of this review I'll leave it for you to experience. The game was meant to have bad controls after all.Despite how much I wanted to shoot myself with an arrow and end it all, I can't help but love it. I love the charm of the game and the feel of it, the sountrack is great, and it's a very humorous game.As much as I wanted to rage quit I persevered, and it felt so rewarding when I finally beat target practice. I could live in peace knowing I wasn't a failure at life. Once you think you get the feel for the game you are challanged with a whopping 10 game modes! (including Target Practice, Advanced Target Practice, The Berserker, Don't Miss, Warband witch is my personal favorite, Eggsterminator, The Noose, Zero G, Zombie Soccer, and Multiplayer). Each having their own unique premise and challanging your archery skills to the max!Do I recomend this game? Surprisingly I do, but that is IF you're up for the challange and how well you can handle rage inducing controls. Like I said it feels good when you manage to beat target practice or any of the others, I mean can you blame your potato sack for being such a horrible archer? Seriously if you're looking for a game that offers a challange look no farther. 7/10			",89,29,1,5,14,0,9

												I've played this game since the 7DFPS version and trialed the demo when it was on Greenlight. The concept of the game is unique and interesting, but the execution of the full release leaves a bit to be desired and seems to be a stray shot.Getting the hang of the controls is half the fun. However, once you understand how the bow and the arms work (as a veteran of Probably Archery, and probably a real-life archer), the challenge is significantly diminished since repetition of the correct technique is not at all difficult. Unless you're going for pinpoint accuracy and high scores, you can beat all the minigames within 20 minutes.The minigames need much more depth. There are several shooting gallery-like levels, with the more interesting ones including the charging Berserker and the Warband, and the need Eggsterminator one is a chuckle and the most fun. The problem is that these minigames are single-level experiences, with the exception of the Berserker, which only has four very quick levels. I don't imagine it's difficult to code in different levels for each minigame (different target layout, more challenges, etc.). Unfortunately, you'll get the feeling of ""Wait, that's it?"" when you complete a minigame.I can't get into any multiplayer games. I don't know whether it's because not many people are playing it, or not many people around me are playing it. Nonetheless, that seems to be where the most replay is, with Team Deathmatch and Horde Mode with multiple waves. But it'd be nice to have single-player versions of those too.I have no idea why Zombie Soccer is part of this game. It feels like a side-project tacked onto the game to add value. I haven't been able to actually play an online match, but it otherwise doesn't look or feel good.Basically, the game has good mechanics but poor replay value. There's simply no depth to the minigame experience. Most of the time spent in the game is figuring out how the controls work, but once you've mastered that, it's not something you'd probably go back to. In some ways, the free Greenlight Demo was more enjoyable -- and free. To pay ~$10 for this game, I'd expect more replay value.			",194,12,2,26,36,2,43

												""Hospital Park Trespasser: Surgeon Became Archer Edition""Concept is good but controls are awful.

They have to change the both-hands-elbow-shoulder-controls to something else. Otherwise this is literally bull♥♥♥♥.In the real life, this is easier than this. Because you don't need to think about what key to press to use your respective muscles.I don't expect them to change controls but if there will be good update about controls, i'll try the game again and edit this review. Right now, not recommended.EDIT: Still, I don't recommend this game but since the last update, there are simplified elbow controls and nock assist. At least developers still updating the game and listening demands of players. Good to see this, keep it up guys.			",760,134,28,65,41,11,74

												If you feel you'd appreciate a game where archery isn't just aim-slightly-higher-than-the-target then this is for you.It lets you do stupid things like notch it at the top of the string and draw the arrow out sideways (instead of directly away from the bow)!Obviously this level control begets difficulty, but with practice the controls become usable.I don't think I'll ever get swift at it, but competency isn't impossible.That said the humour is excellent and they have included an array of gamemodes (including a few multiplayer types).It's not a ""long game"", and for some it will just be for the novelty.Great to see someone making this kind of stuff.

												I have never negatively judged a game as quickly as I have Probably Archery, and I hope I never get another game that gives me the same reaction as this game has.I'll preface this by saying that I don't own any of the Sungeon Simulator-type games, so maybe I'm not the target audience for this game.  I received a coupon for the game and gave it a shot. While I've had buyer's remorse over games that delivered with content I wasn't expecting, this the first game I bought where I felt I was ripped off based on the underwhelming content-to-price ratio.What this game has is promise and premise. That's where the beauty of this game ends, and the ugliness emerges. I'll start by saying the controls are not user-friendly or intuitive at all. Some games, especially games that require reflex controls, have a higher learning curve to fully get into the game. I don't think this is one of those games. I would go as far to say that it feels like the controls were selected arbitrarily, without any real feel to the mechanics.This game, like QWOP, is a testament to how over-burdened controls hinder a game's potential, unless it's a cult-favorite. Judging by my experience, and others, this game doesn't qualify as a cult-favorite.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game oozes with realism. Just like in real life, your wrists, shoulders and hands move independently. And better yet, you basically can never hit any targets, so when you do hit one it feels pretty good. Easily a 10/10 and the worst game I've ever played.			",224,41,14,30,17,2,31

												<h1>Absolutely Terrible</h1>This is not a good game at all. I honestly don't understand why developers would waste theirs and everybody else's time with things like this.It basically has the same cumbersome controls as Surgeon Simulator but lacks any funny consequences. So instead of accidentally cutting someone's spleen open, you (get ready for the excitement) miss a target. Wow. The fun to be had...Overall, I got 3 minutes of gameplay out of it before it was boring. Actually I'm lying, those 3 minutes were boring too.			",39,8,4,6,16,0,3

												这游戏很让人无语，首先第一个难题在拉弓，左手拿弓右手拿箭，可以移动肩膀，手肘和手腕，右手的位置必须正好移动到弓弦才能拉弓，拉弓就得调整好久。第二个问题，拉弓之后弓与箭就是一体的了开始调整射苹果还是靶子还是什么的。箭射出去那个抛物线很怪异，很难命中很小的目标。最后一个问题，每次射完箭你还要花十秒甚至更长时间调整两手位置再拉弓，总之这是个很没有意思的游戏，没看出来什么亮点。晓星我就是个游戏白痴啦，我是玩不惯这种游戏，调整位置实在是很繁琐。完全不是体育类的风格。			",2124,877,92,327,314,27,405

												Intuitive interface. Almost like QWOP, but actually playable.Surprisingly, this is one of the most enjoyable games I've played as of late. The hassle of attempting to control all of your joints, and fire a few shots before getting utterly obliterated, is an absolute blast.Worth it. Even if it's still in development, it can only get better at this point.			",92,2,3,0,10,0,9

												I played this game for about a half hour.  Or rather I tried to actually put the arrow on the bow for about 5 mins total.then I adjusted my bow and arrow for 23 mins total. I acutally shot the arrows for about 2 mins. I hit one target by carefully aiming and  resetting the bow and trial and error. I hit another one outta pure luck. I guess if you like the frustrating nature of these kinds of games, you will have fun. Or have OCD. I may be a little bit of column A and a little bit of column B.			",966,216,24,89,60,8,98

												Damn is this game hard! Three seperate sit down sessions before I was able to hit a single target, but it was such a satisfying feeling when I did. I think nocking the arrow is the only real difficulty for me, but it may be simple as pie for you! Great game, would buy it again.			",98,18,0,10,23,0,8
