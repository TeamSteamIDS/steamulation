												So, what makes this vehicular football game so great?- Great gameplay- Marvelous graphics- Very competitive- Alright singleplayer- Tons of customization- Easy to pick up, hard to master- Up to 4-player splitscreen (!!)- Cross-platform+ Much more to experience for yourself!Cons:- Servers were pretty bad to begin with, but that's fixed now tho', so this should not count as a con.Everything else that I would have written as a con, is currently being added, so I have no complaints about this game at all.''Just one more game'' - everyone.

Rocket League has one of the best progression systems I've ever seen in a video game before...Rookie - You can't hit♥♥♥♥♥♥ You are a disgrace to your team and the game.Semi Pro - You can now sometimes hit the ball. Don't even try to hit it in the right direction or think about your positioning. You're only Semi Pro so you can just go ahead and hit that ball! You also made a bicycle hit that one time but yeah nah you're still♥♥♥♥♥♥Pro - You have learnt how to shoot the ball accurately from the ground. You're the best! Late into Pro level, you would have likely looked up advanced tips for Rocket League. Worst mistake of your life. You now know what aerials are. You think you can fly. The ball comes up high and you go for an aerial. Once you jump, you fly straight into the ground and continue to do frontflips until you land on your back... What the ♥♥♥♥ happened there? Oh. You're using keyboard. Yeah nah, time to get a controller,♥♥♥♥♥♥head.Veteran - You now have a controller and go for terribly unlikely aerials. You think you're good. You can hit the lower aerials consistently and you can now be considered an addition to your team. Congratulations!Expert - You can now consistently hit aerials accurately at any height. This game is now your life. You can also score off a wall every now and then. Good times.Master - You are now a god to every level lower than you. You have perfected the art of wall shots. You are an extremely cool person. A nice little bonus is that everyone under the level of Pro will now spam ""Sorry!"" every time they do something wrong to you.Legend - The most badass-looking title you can have. ♥♥♥♥ Rocketeer. You probably now have an extreme case of false confidence. Once you get used to the badass title, you'll wreck anything and anyone with ease. You can also pull off freestyles consistently. Nice job! Also be sure to prepare for an endless stream of ""You're not good enough for Legend!""Rocketeer - You can now 720-freestyle-backflip-reverse-backwards-aerial-air dribble off a wall with ease. You probably boosted for that Rocketeer tag, but if you didn't: Still prepare for another endless stream of ""You're not good enough for Rocketeer!""But in all seriousness, I absolutely love this game and I'm sure anyone will.

├Professors Review┤Overall Score: 95/100Game Pros• Highly Addicting• Frequent updates• Split Screen Multiplayer • 60 FPS (Its capped, but unlockable if you really want more frames. But 60 is just swell)• Supports In-game voice/text chat• Low ping (Make sure to select your region in the server filters)• Clean Interface• Cross platform (Optional) • Smooth Gameplay • Customizable cars (You can even give them hats!)• In-game replay recorder (Just hit ""save replay"" after any match)• Incredible visuals• Crates (Unlock valuable items using microtransactions)• Diversity in game modes • Controller support (The game suggests to use a controller, but honestly, the keyboard works perfectly. All preference)• In game training editor (Create and practice your own shots!)Game Cons• ""Report"" button basically does nothingRelateable Games•  Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Power Battle-CarsConclusionRocket League is an amazing game. You know those games that you play while you should be going to bed? That's this game. Only 90 minutes into the game, and i've already had so much fun with it. I would honestly reccomend this game to anyone. Unless you REALLY hate soccer, and you simultaneously REALLY hate cars.(If you found this review helpful, consider giving it a thumbs up!)

												Rocket League is a perfect game for short breaks. 5 minutes of flying and exploding cars, then I can continue doing whatever I was doing before. (To be honest, it usually ends up in ""one more match"" multiple times. That's how it's good.)The game is easy to learn and just fun to play. Making the perfect aerial shot, passing to a goal, saving the ball from reaching your goal at the last possible moment, failing hard and scoring an own goal... These are all moments you will see in Rocket League.Are you in a mood for tactical game? Play 2v2. Do you want chaos? Play 4v4.I love car customization. Who doesn't want to have a car with sombrero and rainbow trail?

												Rocket League is less of a ""sports game"" and more of an actual sport. In FIFA or Madden you have a ""pass"" button, but to make a pass in Rocket League you have to drive your car into the ball at the right speed and angle to send it over to where your teammate is going. You have to create the pass yourself, and it can be anything, from a hard bounce off the back wall to a soft lob over the defender. Passing, shooting, dribbling, tackles, jukes, they're all in the game, but you  have to make them happen yourself, not just press the right button. At first, just driving car to ball is a challenge, but as your skill grows, the freedom to create any play you can imagine and execute is unlike anything you'll find in a ""sports game"". Together with the mechanical skill to do what you want with the ball, you'll have to develop positional awareness and learn proper rotation and game sense. There are very few games that are consistently rewarding for hundreds or thousands of hours, that can keep challenging you as you improve, and improve, and improve beyond what you ever imagined you'd be capable of. In fact, this is the ONLY one I know. Best.Game.Ever.			",205,58,3,30,55,4,36

												Edited as of: 21st July 2015 01:00Pros:+ Its a football/soccer game that contains rocket powered cars (added soccer because of americans).+ It is purely a skill based game and everything the player does matters.+ (in my experience) my game seems to run at a stable 60FPS after turning off the frame limiter.+ Graphics looking quite nice.+ PC, PS4 cross play is possible.+ Its easy to learn, Impossible to master.+ Ranking system currently works well with score gained or lost each match.+ There are a lot of friendly players in the steam community.+ Save replays after matches and edit them to your hearts content in the editor+ Full xbox 360/xbox one controller supportCons:- PS4, PC cross parties are currently non-existant- You can unlock a lot of things in such a small time, I'm level 20/30 and I have 100% of the items- Some people have crashing issues (mainly NVIDIA DRIVER ISSUES, I run AMD so I do not have these issues myself)- Lower ranks may take a large time for even skilled players to get out of due to solo 3v3 treating everyone the same- You cannot communicate to PS4 players except for a small amount of pre-determined chat commands- Voice codec is rather terrible, so advice is to use out of game communicationMiddle:= Servers are pretty much sorted now, the occasional lag spike will happen at peak times though= Currently no spectator system= NO PEER TO PEER, so even private matches require servers to be up= 4v4 is the limit, (some people see that as good, some as bad)= Any controller other than xbox may require some outside support or some other sort of executableThat is as fair as I can be to it, if I missed anything out, tell me.TL:DR, I think its a good game from my experience :DGET THE GAME HEREEDIT 1: Thanks to everyone for voting this to be the most helpful review for rocket league, to thank everyone, have this as a reward: REWARD[www.omfgdogs.com] have a great day guys :DFor those of you who asked for my PC specs, they can be found HERE[uk.pcpartpicker.com]EDIT 2: Last of all, Shameless plug for my Rocket League group you should TOTALLY join if you own the game because why not, lets play some games.

Product received for free
												I received Rocket League from a friend who swore by it that it was fun and addicting. Following that, I proceeded to play with him and some other friends; but we sucked...bad.700+ logged hours later....I am in the top 1% of all players in ranked and am addicted to this game!--------------------------------------Rocket league is a game that you can pickup for the first time and be terrible at, but have that feeling that if you fixed a few things, or made a few different moves, you could have done much much better. It is a fast paced game where:-The idea of the game is simple-The controls are exceptional! (For real, the cars all react to your controls exactly how you think they should.)-The skill cap is insanely high-Every single time the ball goes in the air, you feel like it is possible to make an insane goal off of itRocket league is the type of game that I can pickup for a few games and put back down, or I can just delve deep into an 8 hour session and keep trying to rank up and fix my mistakes I had last game.------------------------------------Psyonix (The developer) knows how to run this game. They are constantly pushing out new updates, patches, and content; most of which is free!They allow you to customize your vehicles, so no two are the same. Or you and some friends can team up, create the exact same cars, then be a three man wrecking crew of flying vans!Psyonix really thought of everything with Rocket league, and they keep adding more and more great content!------------------------------------All-in-all, Rocket league is a great game, cannot recommend it enough, and is totally worth even up to a price of $60! (Even though I got it for free!)So have fun in rocket league, work your way to the top, and...Calculated.Calculated.Calculated.			",74,4,5,4,4,0,4

												If you're even just slightly interested in arcade racing games and/or football, then you should check this out...well, actually, even if you're not ;)In Rocket League, you're playing football (or soccer) with cars, with the addition that you have a speed booster and you can jump, which can make for some great moves and aerial shots.You can choose from 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 or 4v4 Matches, so it's nowhere near as much players as in real football, but that's actually a good thing, even with 4v4 it can get pretty messy and chaotic...then again, that can be fun as well ^^It's rather easy to get into the game, as you have tutorial for the basics, like handling your booster, doing aerial shots, defense etc. But that doesn't mean there is no challenge. To do those insane aerial maneuvers, you'll need quite some training.The Main Motivation comes from being a competitive game, either via ranked games or normal matches against other players. There is also a single-player mode, but that's more for practicing and getting into the game than a selling point for the game.You can also unlock stuff for your car, like hats, booster color, tires and patterns to put onto your car.I've never been a big fan of either genre, yet Rocket League manages to pull me in and gets me excited about every match i play. Even if you're playing with random people, it's not that bad and you can have quite some fun, though having a good team which is working good together would be the most fun.So, hope to see some of you on the field :)			",315,208,6,26,27,4,18

												IF you've never played Rocket League, like many other good games you're probably going to be dog♥♥♥♥♥♥when you first start. You'll first join the tutorial and start touching the ball, yea it feels good we know. Then you decide you'll give online a go, REAllY see what this ♥♥♥♥♥ is about. You're first game online you get 2 clears and a center ball, pretty raunchy. You decide to tax yourself on another game and press rematch. You give a great pass to your team mate, wou lose 1-2. You continue to play online even though you have no idea what the ♥♥♥♥ you're doing but for some reason you can't stop playing it. Then you start to progress and get better and learn to manipulate the car and the ball in ways you've never seen, and fly(Did I mention you could ♥♥♥♥ing fly). You then start to forget about where you came from and whether or not you even liked the damn game to begin with. You slowly then being training every day before work or school, practicing aerials and dribbling in free play mode. The ball slowly becomes a part of you. You become the rank of ""Pro"" and you're feeling pretty damn hot right now♥♥♥♥♥♥ even scalding. You slowly climb the ranks and descend into the madness that is rocket league. Then the itch starts. You'll be at work or out running errands thinking about how much better time could be spent playing rocket league. When you see a subaru on the road, it's not a subaru to you anymore it's now a Takumi. When you go to bed you dream of Rocket League. Now we go back to the original question of whether or not you would like this game? You'll ♥♥♥♥ing love it, too much. The developers, Psyonix, are incredibly good at listening to what the community wants. Each update they continue to push out more and more content and the game is growing everyday. So many funny options to decorate and customize your cars, from toppers to antennas. You can unlock items in game and craft rarer, more exclusive items from those. You dont have to good at rocket league to like it, you just have to be better at having fun. I have made so many memories off this $20 purchase. Like how the hell are they only charging $20 for this game its incredible. I Have put more time and heart into this game on PC and Xbox then any of the main AAA titles that I used to play, and I probably won't stop. Buy this game. Play this game. Love this game.

												Rocket League is a vehicle based football game developed by Psyonix. In Rocket League you get behind the wheel of one of a number of different cars and face off against up to 4 opponents in an effort to hit a giant football in to the opposing team's goal. Enjoyable in solo play, local multiplayer and online matchmaking you can either play 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4 and even unbalanced matches! (only available in offline exhibition mode).+Great graphics and visual effects+A wide range of customisation options unlocked as you complete matches+There's a season mode if you wish to play solo so you don't have to just play exhibition games repeatedly, the season mode is actually pretty good and features a number of different options which make it more interesting+Local multiplayer supports up to four players (providing you have enough controllers)+A number of different maps, each with several time and weather variations+Cross-platform multiplayer with PS4 players (though the party system currently doesn't work when doing cross-platform matches)+Rocket League features some quick messages which get assigned to your controller's hat switch allowing you to communicate quickly with your teammates+You can save the replays of your matches to watch back later+Obviously it has full controller support for 360 controllers as well as Xbox One controllers and the controls are fantastic+It's even entertaining for those of us who aren't keen on playing sports games+Your car's top speed is considerably higher on a pitch made of tarmac compared to a grass pitch, it's not a major feature but it's certainly a nice touch+As mentioned earlier you can play unbalanced matches when playing offline exhibition, they provide and extra layer of challenge and are great fun when playing local multiplayer+/-The game's bots aren't great but this game is best enjoyed by playing multiplayer anyway-Solo play gets pretty repetitiveVerdict:An Essential Purchase (9.5/10)Rocket League is an incredibly good multiplayer game with great visuals, lots of customisation options and a number of different maps. If you're looking for a new multiplayer game or just something a bit different, you've come to the right place.No drama, Just Reviews.El K.			",670,170,24,76,100,6,76

												Fast-paced game where cars play football carball. A great concept backed up by its great gameplay!Everything on this game is just spot on; The steering, the map sizes, the game lenghts, where the boosts are placed at...This game has also alot content to unlock. There are no real advantanges what car you are using, except some cars have a bit tinier or larger hit box. I honestly like this, because I can use the car for the looks and not for the advantage.No matter if you play mostly FPS games, MOBA, mmorpg etc. this game will be perfect for you. I can honestly recommend this game for EVERYONE. I am pretty sure that I will spend hundreds of hours on this game.Buy this game, you wont regret it.			",86,22,5,10,7,1,5

In the 80s and 90s, this is what everyone thought video games would be like in the future: rocket cars playing virtual sports; TRONxSpeed Racer, with the international appeal of soccer. You're jacked in to this new thing called the Internet, where you can play against people the world 'round. You're a weakly 13 year old midwesterner named Billy, but when you're jacked in, you're Tom Cruise in Top Gun, no, Days of Thunder. You're the best there ever was.Stay on target, stay on target... click, blarp. You're out of rocket fuel! You click again just in case, like a last desperate pull of an empty gun's trigger. The clock ticks downward as you swerve towards a boost pickup... you grab it... seconds left on the clock... the ball appears in front of you as an angel out of the blue... you jump, squeeze the last bit of juice out of your machine and soar heavenward... AND IT'S GOOD! BILLY FROM THE MIDWEST HAS DEFEATED THE RUSSIAN MENACE!!!!Every second you play the game is the last five minutes of every sports movie ever made.			",429,114,8,38,41,9,50

												Rocket League is a great game. The core mechanics are fun and very well executed. Currently the servers don't work and I haven't been able to play online. I would easily reccomend this game for the single player alone. The only real concern I have is that it may not offer enough content to keep the community alive for any significant length of time.  Edit* Servers are working now. For a more in-depth review watch my video review here:

												Rocket League is an excellent game and one of my favourites. It's very easy to understand but hard to master.Optimisation is great, and graphics are fantastic. The game also has a full controller support, but you can play with a mouse and keyboard as well, so it's up to you how you want to play. I more prefer the controller.After the first launch of the game, you will hear a fantastic music on the menu. After that, you can choose your car. Play a tutorial, and finally, you will be ready to play your first multiplayer game.In the game, there are a lot of cars, and you can also buy paid DLC. Cars from DLCs are technically the same. The only differences are hit boxes. According to developers, all of the cars have the same stats. Vehicles are customisable. For example, you can add an antenna, change your wheels, colour of the car, etc.Like I wrote above Rocket League is very easy to understand because, in the main mode, the game consists of control the giant ball and try to score. To put it simply, it's just football with cars. You can choose between 1vs1, 2vs2, 3vs3, and 4vs4. The main modes are playable on casual and competitive modes. But there are also game modes which are more advanced like for example ice hockey, basketball and my personal favourite 'RUMBLE'. In 'RUMBLE' rules are the same, but here, every ten seconds the game draws for you one special ability. For example grappling hook, a tornado and a freezer weapon.As I mentioned above, here are competitive matches. After ten games, you will get your rank. There's  15 ranks: PROSPECT (I, II, III, Elite) CHALLENGER (I, II, III, Elite), RISING STAR, ALL-STAR, SUPERSTAR, CHAMPION, SUPER CHAMPION, GRAND CHAMPION.The game rewards us in the form of points for all sorts of tricks, like aerials, bicycle hits, etc.The VerdictRocket League is a unique game with simple rules. If you haven't bought this game yet, do it. You won't regret. My final rating is 10/10.If you found any mistakes, something isn't right, or you just don't like this review. Instead of giving me a thumbs down, tell me what is wrong. Thank you.			",48,4,0,1,7,1,4

												Buy this gameBuy this gameBuy this gameChat disabled for 4 seconds﻿You'll find yourself playing hours upon hours with Rocket League. It's a must have game, and just about anybody can play it. I'd have to give Rocket League 9 - 1/2 out of 10. only because I don't like the match making system. I think it's a little broken to be honest.You'll have a good amount of vehicles to choose from the get go with coustom paint jobs, stickers, hats and other crazy things. (DLC's) are worth getting too.An amazing soundtrack. The music in this game gets a 10/10.It's an awesome game to just have fun with with friends or family and is well worth buying.Edit...As of today, I can honestly say ranked matches are foocked! I'm sick to death of going in to a match with awesome team mates one game and to then go into the next match with AFK's and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's a never ending cycle. Within the last fifty matches, I haven't moved up or down ranks at all.  The game is still awesome, just stay in unranked if you want to enjoy it.			",538,131,54,52,62,7,48

 Very addictive and entertaining game. Rocket League is a game that always introduces new aspects to you and never lets you get bored. It is definitely a 'just 5 more minutes' game but amazingly entertaining at the same time. The trading community is excellent and finally getting an item you always wanted can leave you feeling so accomplished. The car customization itself is an awesome feature that offers so many different customizations. As you progress through the different skill levels there are new techniques to learn and playstyles which are awesome to know. The competitive scene behind this game is getting larger and it is so fun to watch such high level players play!All in all, i'd completely recommend this game to anyone, whether you're a casual player or very competitive!

												edit: I wrote this prior to becoming an employee at PsyonixLet me start by saying that I have been playing the preview of this game since June 26th, I also was a part of the alpha in 2014 and part of multiple betas.Simply said, this game is the most fun that may ever exist. You find yourself constantly saying 'Just one more game' over and over and over again because you literally cannot just put it down. It's simple: a car arena like showdown on a soccer field with one giant ball and a bunch of boost to fill your rocket powered dreams, but don't be fooled because this game is much deeper than it will originally look. Psyonix takes a very simlpe core idea and allows us to do whatever we want with it because of its purely physics based gameplay. What does this give us though? Let me tell you. Satisfyingly tight controls, action packed multiplayer, awe inspiring aerial goals, sniper tactics, competitive and casual matchmaking, hours of laughing and enjoyment, TONS of explosions (Mr. Torgue aproved), an incredibly balanced game, all future maps will be free, PC to PS4 crossplay, over 150 items for purely cosmetic customizations, and over 10billion of said combinations. I can really only say so much about the game itself (partly because English was my worst course :P) but what I really cannot stress enough is that you won't be staying for just the game alone. You'll be seeing Psyonix as one of the only developers left that actually understand what we want as well as falling in love with the community. The community of Rocket League (and SARPBC for that matter) is probably the most open, friendly and supportive community I have come accross. Of course this is being said before release and I really hope that you new players please uphold our standard of ingame complements, willingness to help out anyone that wants to learn, and general good sportsmanship. If you find yourself running into a few bad apples, don't worry about it, as you climb up the ladder into the ranks with the rest of the long time players you'll notice the warmer atmosphere to say the least :)Now I suppose I should say that within the last week I've apparently played nearly 90hrs and that's just playing private matches with the same people constantly. Some would think that I'd be bored after that, but you'd be so so wrong. I can play all day, get into bed and watch some Rocket League videos, and then immediately want to play more (I may or may not be addictive :| but don't think you're immune).Anyways, I'm going to play some more Rocket League. I hope to see you on the field, and remember... Nice shpt! And never let the ball touch the ground (Rule #1)			",129,26,6,12,22,3,10

												Rocket League is one of my favorite games.  Why?The game's system is the best that i can imagine. Your advantage over other players isn't measured by how many hours you have, how many dlcs you got, or your level. It's measured by how much you've learned and perfected.You start as a derp car that can't hit a ball 20ft above the ground. Then you keep playing against people of the same skill, until you see someone who can do some cool/pro/funky/op stuff, then you see his goals and you think: ""Wow, look at that shot, i must learn how to do it!""              Then in a matter of time, you learn how to do it and even do better. One step closer to become a Rocketeer.                                                                         some more training and you can hit the ball wherever it is.                                                    even more and you can aim the ball wherever you want.The controls are great, comfortable and very easy to learn. If you use a controller, you will not have an advantage against who uses a keyboard and vice-versa.The graphics are nice, you can play it with a microwave using low graphics, or a medium computer on max graphics with a solid 60 fps. They could be better though (?)The levels normally represent your skill very well if you aren't a lot above-average or below-average, with a Rookie playing like a rookie and a legend playing like a legend. (The level ""Pro"" is just wrong, you probably aren't pro yet if you are there)The matchmaker does its job well. Rather than your level, it takes your ""skill"" in consideration, so you will often play with people only slightly better or worse than you. This isn't bad, it is actually very good for you to learn and get better.Can i say anything more?NO item in the game gives you advantage over other player, all cars have the same speed and the only thing that changes is the hitbox, not a big deal when you learn the controls. The DLCs don't make you better or anything, too.			",166,20,5,12,17,0,12

												OK first of all its a shame that most negative reviews are based on first 2 days after release where the team of devs had some problems with the servers. They worked day an night and now everything is working fine at least for me.So, i played this game on Beta on PS4 and i was pretty hyped about the launch. It didn't disapoint. I have it for free on PS4 and bought it on steam to play with friends.The game is a ton of fun. The gameplay is easy to learn, hard to master.Graphics are pretty nice and cars come with a ton of costumization options (FOR FREE).We can face AI opponents with diferente skill levels (that can make a huge diference) or we can play vs players usually with simillar skill (sometimes u can face players really better than u but their in game rate is the same or lower than yours).There are several game modes but the only major difference is the amount of players and ranked match or not.Its great to play with friends. Hard to quit playing even if you're really tired.I seriously recomend using a controller. I use my DS4 with Bluetooth (using inputmapper) and it works perfectly. For ppl using other controllers i recomend x360ce (helped 2 friend who were using a ds2 and a sega saturn controller).A word also for the devs that seem to work night and day to fix problems. Keep up the  good work.Great game. One of the better for sure to release this year.			",55,7,0,8,3,2,6

Rocket League ReviewGame DetailsGame: Rocket LeagueGenre: SportsDeveloped by: PsyonixPublished by: PsyonixRelease Date: 7 July, 2015Metacritic Score: 86 (Link[www.metacritic.com])Game Review""Lets play some Carball!""Rocket League is a game which combines soccer and reckless driving. It is a sequel to the game SARPBC, Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars and it is produced by Psyonix. It includes cross-platform play between PS4 and PC, having an huge playerbase currently.GameplayYou will have lots of fun with this game guaranteed! The controls are ultra-simple to use, you will get used to them in a blink of an eye. I play the game with a controller, which for me it is the best way to play it, but it is enjoyable to play with the keyboard + mouse too. The game itself is ultra fun! The ball physics with the rebounds and all feel impressively well, as the cars handling. It is incredibly easy to play, yet extremely difficult to master. You also have to use strategy in this game in order to win the matches, much like regular soccer. If you are just a ball chaser you will have difficult times winning, you have to think about your positioning and timing very well. You can also do incredible trick shots and jump shots due to your boost, which are incredible hard to master, but after some time you will start to get the hang of it. The worst part are some camera angles and the bots AI, but unless you plan on only playing offline games, the AI wont be much of a problem. It feels so good to make some incredible plays, even when you fail you will have tons of laughs. It is a very simple game with simple ideas, yet they work perfectly and make this game a blast to play for both casual and professional players.LongevityThe longevity of a game which relies on an multiplayer-focused game can be debatable, but in this one I am sure you will spend enough hours to compensate the money you spend in the game. At the moment I have spent 35 hours and intend to spend many more. You have tons of cars, paint jobs, hats and other customization stuff to unlock during the game that will keep you entertained for the first hours (I unlocked everything in around 20 hours). You also have 4 different game-modes (1vs1, 2vs2, 3vs3, 4vs4) which give some good diversity since each one of the modes has its own strategies to follow in order to win them. You also have an offline season mode available to play, but it is kind of boring in my opinion given the multiplayer options you have. Practice mode is also available, a great place to tune your skills up. The ranks and leaderboards system will also entertain you, it is great to climb up against your friends in the diverse list of leaderboards available.Graphics and PresentationOnly have good things to say here too. By the moment you enter the game you will know you are in for something special. Slick menus with an ultra easy interface plus amazing songs will make you excited right at the first time you open the game. You got plenty of voice commands to use in-game which is definitely a plus presentation wise. Now the graphics. Another win in this spectacular game. Great graphics for a game this simple. All works really well, the colors, grass, car details, everything looks great. The level of detail in the cars and their customization objects is great too. These are some impressive visuals, even though the main focus of the game is definitely not the graphics.Music and SoundsThe soundtrack in this game is amazing. I was totally not expecting it, there are really some great songs in it, got some of them stuck in my head. There are only around eleven songs in it, but most are awesome and don't get old. The various sounds in the game are also great, from the sounds of the different boost types, ball hits, drifts, crashes, everything works really well.MultiplayerThis is the big deal in this game. And oh boy, how fun it is to play it with or against friends. You will have tons of fun making the best goals ever as well as the biggest fails in history. It really gives you tons of laughs. You have also the option to play ranked instead of casual games, which make for some more intense, fun matches! The playerbase is huge, around 100000 players are online in most of the time, so you will find games in a matter of seconds. The community is in it´s majority very friendly, but like in all multiplayer games, you will find some toxic people playing the game too. You also have different server regions to choose from so you can play without worrying about lag. Unfortunately I did have some crazy lags in some european servers. It is rare to find a laggy server but it happens and can get very frustrating, specially when you are playing ranked. Yet, I am sure the devs will fix most of the server issues soon, so no worries about that.SummaryPros:Newcomer-friendly gameplay, yet difficult to masterGreat controlsAmazing soundtrackGreat graphics and presentationAmazing multiplayer with lots of fast-paced, intense matchesCons:The Bots AI is pretty weakSome connection issues in multiplayerMy personal score: 9.0/10If you enjoy high octane reckless driving and the world's most popular sport, Rocket League is for you. It is one of the most fun multiplayer games released in the last years. The base price is great value for the game you get, which will get you hours and hours of great fun! Embrace the latest gaming trend in Steam and PS4 and have a blast playing this soccer-meets-cars gem!			",814,226,41,97,55,8,123

IntroductionI've often found myself with little pockets of time in which I've wondered, ""What should I do now?"". You know, those moments in time where you have too little time to play a really lengthy, story-driven game (or League of Legends), but way more time than you can feasibly sit and idle. It's as if our prayers were collectively answered with this fantastic game from Psyonix; Rocket League.Take out your controllers boys & girls, we're playing football....with cars.GameplayI've been playing games like Fifa and PES from the glory '98 days, but eventually my interests changed. After all, it was simply a game of football. There is only so much you can do with human players. Apparently Psyonix thought outside of the box. What they delivered was simply a stroke of genius. Gone were the human players we were accustomed to. Instead, rocket-powered cars jetted their way across the map in record speeds. This wasn't enough though. They altered the map, super-sized the ball, and set each player in control of only one car at a time.This formula gave birth to the high-intensity game of Rocket League. Your goal is to hit the massive ball into the opponent's goal. Sounds simple enough right? Wrong. With rocket jumps, speed boosts, rocket-propelled flight and the unique map shapes, you'll find yourself in an endless chase at breakneck speed for possession of the ball. While this game is absolutely beginner friendly, it has an insanely high skill-ceiling. In other words, no matter how good you think you are, there is someone who is leagues above you.Each team can have up to 5 players, though the 3v3 format is the standard mode, and has a nice balance between chaos and fun. The potential teamwork between players is definiely one of my favourite aspects, and promotes friendly behavior for those epic goals. Don't be surprised if you get called out for accidentally hitting the ball away from the opponent's goal, or worse, hitting it into your own.Quick-chat commands are rather peaceful, but after seeing 3 censored swear words, you'll probably get the idea. The sarcastic tones of ""What a Save!"" upon scoring a goal always gives me a chuckle, and the genuine compliments from opponents is a welcome breath of fresh air, and pride.Car selection & customization should probably be a mini-game on its own. With a wide variety of colours, hats, boost trails and decals to choose from, you'll likely have more than a few saved presets that you'll cycle through. With an ever-growing roster of cars and cosmetics, there's plenty to appeal to everyone.Speaking of appeal, there's much more than your classic game of football in Rocket League. Games such as basketball and hockey have found their way into the ever-growing list of game modes, and I often find myself cycling through them all quite frequently. Hell, even my 5 year old cousin loves it. Think you've got the skills to make it higher? You'll be happy to test your skills in the competitive mode. To be honest, I haven't really played much of this, since I prefer the other modes so much more.VisualsDon't let its colourful nature confuse you, rocket league is one beautiful & optimized game. I was pleasantly surprised to discover how easy it was to run on even some old potatoes, and its ability to be quite visually appealing on higher settings. The explosions and particle effects are both colourful and beautiful. The cars are nicely detailed, and the animations are right on point. AudioIf you for some reason haven't listened to Rocket League's soundtrack, get it...now. I find myself upset that it's not on by default while playing, but there are plenty of workarounds to really listen and enjoy the music all year round. The tracks are entertaining and insanely high quality. Soundtrack aside, the regular SFX are no less impressive. Vehicle sounds, explosions, and the 'fake crowd' cheering are just a few of the many things this game has to offer for your audiophile needs.Summary & ConclusionWhether you've got only 5 minutes to spare, or an entire afternoon, Rocket League offers hours of addictive fun that never seems to grow old. This unique spin on a timeless sport is sure to appeal to a very wide audience, and you can be sure that your experience is likely gonna be a great one.For $20, this game is worth full price, but you can always get it on sale pretty often.I rarely grant this one but,10/10 - Just simply fun, addicting and worth every penny.Props to the devs for showing that an independent team could release such a big hit without submitting to the horrible DLC practices of modern gaming.======================================This endorsement approved by The Reviewers' Union,providing better standards for reviews and reviewers.====================================== ",391,84,26,36,18,4,41

												Amazing game.This game is so dynamic and energetic, not a second is spent bored. Non stop action with your team, always edging to get the game deciding nudge, whether it be defense or attack. You spend hours, upon hours, getting addicted and mastering your skills. This game will make it to the massive multiplayer leagues. Rocket League will improve once they get proper class ranks, gained through playing ranked matches. Rocket League also features in depth customisation, allowing the user to ultimately customise their vehicle. This allows uniqueness, and a great ton of laughter.Graphics of this game are amazing. If your computer isn't the best then you'll have to turn down the graphics a little, but your PC doesn't need to be expensive to play the game on great graphics. Decent laptops can even play this game decently.This game is honestly a 9/10. Rocket League has the graphics, the dynamic energetic gameplay, the competitive experience in multiplayer and more.

												Rocket League is a Football(Soccer) inspired sports game made by Psyonix. In this game you use a car to hit around a large ball into a goal, pretty much Football(Soccer) with cars. It might be the best game I've played this year so far.There are a few different game modes, including online, Exhibition where you play against bots or your friends in local play, and a season mode where you play as a member on a team and you try and complete a season and win the championship. The game modes are fun, but not very different from each other. I do wish the Season mode was more like a Franchise mode in something like Madden, being able to control all the little things of your team, and having more stat tracking would make it a lot better, but its still worth a play or two.The gameplay in this game is perfect. Once you figure out the flow to your car, how to use boosting properly, and how to track the ball, you'll realize just how addicing the game can be. Against bots or online, the game shines in its fun and addicting gameplay that adds a unique twist on the game of Football(Soccer). Learning the game comes quick, but mastering the techniques could easily take 30-50 hours of gameplay. You have a large selection of cars and different things you can design them with. The speed and hitboxes are pretty much the same, so there isn't an optimal car to use, which is a great thing. All the different customization is basically cosmetic that does some minor stat tracking. I'm really happy they went this route, because you don't feel obligated to build your car based on some kind of metagame, you can customize it however you like it. Besides the season mode being kind of lacking, the only other complaint I had(notice, had), was the online. The first day I had it I couldn't play online at all, it just didn't work, and apparently until Saturday the online was pretty much broken. Thankfully, its been pretty much fixed, but I thought it would be an important point to mention. It is good that the developers showed commitment and actually fixed the problem, though.Rocket League is an amazing game with addictive gameplay. I don't really get the people that say they don't like sports games, a lot of the gameplay and stat tracking in them is great, and this game is no exception. If your looking for a game to play with friends, or even by yourself that is very competitive based, or even if your just bored and looking for a game to risk $20 on, Give Rocket League a shot, its one of the best games to come out this year. Pros:-Strong gameplay-Easy to learn, hard to master -Plenty of car customization-No car building meta, you can customize without worry-Encoranges teamwork-Reasonable asking price($20)Cons:-Lacking season mode could use more stat tracking and player control Buy At Full Price  ",405,96,7,66,41,4,42

												This game doesn’t really need another “thumbs up” but I feel obligated to write a review since I spent 100+ hours playing it (by the way, that’s a lie! I only played a couple of matches!) It doesn’t matter if you are a racing/football fan or not. You’ll love it. This game appeals to both casual and competitive players. You will suck most of the time and sometimes score amazing goals and it would feel incredible! This is one of those games that is easy to learn and very hard to master. I am still horrible at it after 100 hours. The good thing is that it is still entertaining even if you are losing more often than winning. So is it a great game? Hell, yes! Do I recommend it? No, unless you want to get sucked in and get addicted to this devil’s child of a game. I got it for free with Steam hardware. At this point I am ready to pay $20 just to get rid of it. I am uninstalling it tonight. I am just going to play one match real quick. Ok, maybe two... Addiction Level: Crack cocaine / 10.UPDATE: I now have 300+ hours in this game. Please send help.UPDATE 2: 500 hours... whatever, keep my soul, Rocket League!			",1582,794,33,163,160,17,190

												As a competitive gamer, it's not often I'm able to find a game that continues to be enjoyable while I'm getting getting completely dominated; but Rocket League delivers that perfectly. I've played for almost 400-hours and I have yet to figure out why, exactly, this game is so fun to so many different people from so many walks of life. But whatever the reason, Psyonix has delivered a near-flawless hybrid cross between a Single-Character-Controlled Sports game (Soccer, Hockey, Basketball), a Racing game, a Flying game, and a competitive multiplayer experience.Pros:- Replayability is consistent.- Servers cover /many/ regions. (Most of the world.)- No single Battlecar has a distinct advantage in all fields over every other Battlecar. (There are pros and cons to every Battlecar.)- Battlecar customizability feels endless.- Fun for casual gamers.- Fun for competitive gamers.- Quick 5-minute matches so you aren't forced to risk losing after 45-minutes.- Split-screen playable Local OR Online.- Psyonix listens to players and integrates desired features.- This Pros list could go on and on.Cons:- Not the easiest game to just pick up and play.-- New players may become discouraged by having difficulty hitting the ball at all. (Don't give up! You'll get it down relatively quickly!)- Online players can be incredibly rude (as with any online multiplayer game).- It takes a LOT of time to become a skilled player.- In-game voice chat quality is unbearable. (Most players use third-party VoIP programs to avoid this issue.)It has been years since I've found a game that has me as addicted and dedicated as I am to Psyonix's Rocket League. This is a game I'll be playing for a long, long time.9.5/10EDIT: Paid DLC is not completely cosmetic, as DLC Battlecars have different hitboxes and turn radiuses than base cars. This, however, does not make any paid DLC Battlecar specifically better than base Battlecars. Every Battlecar has its pros and cons between hitboxes and turn radiuses.			",303,69,20,18,25,8,30

												To give you an idea of how good this game is - I currently have 511 games in my Steam library, and this is the only one I've gone out of my way to review. SARPBC (the PS3 predecessor to Rocket League) has been a favorite of my friends and I for... years. Literally years. We've put thousands of hours into it. It's one of those incredibly rare games that all of us are always keen to play because it's always fun. Rocket League, I'm happy to say, is SARPBC with improved graphics and gameplay, better accessibility for new players, plus a ton of added options that give the game an extra layer of character. It's going to comfortably replace SARPBC in my top five games, all-time, across all genres. It's also replacing SARPBC as my absolute favorite multiplayer game - online or local. Positive+ Fun, deep, brilliantly fast-paced gameplay+ Games are long enough to mean something, but short enough that a loss is never too frustrating.+ Games are almost never over until the final buzzer. Results can turn on a dime - and when they do, it's always because a player or team has stepped up, rather than any fault of or flaw with the game itself. + The learning curve is fairly smooth, but the skill ceiling is also incredibly high. Despite the aforementioned years playing SARPBC, I still see players in Rocket League pulling off moves that I can only dream of.+ There's massive flexibility in how you play, more than any other game I know of. Offline with bots. Offline split-screen. Online. Online split-screen. Online split-screen with bots. 1 v 1 if you don't feel like playing on a team, or 2 v 2 / 3 v 3 / 4 v 4 if you do. And the game is just as suited to mano-a-mano matches as it is to team play, which is (again) a very, very rare quality.Negative- The one slightly disappointing thing I'll mention is (at launch) the lack of variety in maps. SARPBC had a bunch of quite inventive, distinctive maps that forced different play styles and tactics. Rocket League's maps are aesthetically different, but structurally uniform. Luckily, word is that some 'crazier' maps will likely be arriving in the forthcoming free DLC.  I'm still thoroughly enjoying what's already there, but some extra variety in that regard will definitely be welcome.ConclusionIf the idea of fast-paced soccer (sans rules) with cars even vaguely appeals to you, get this game immediately. It's one I fully expect to still be playing - and thoroughly enjoying - years from now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Rocket League is one of the most unique, innovative games around.

												This game is as addicting as FIFA soccer is. I do however recommend it with prudence. This game is action packed but can be seen simplistic by a few.I've played the game back in alpha and didn't much care for it. I like it now more than previously, which is an extremely good thing.Rocket league is a soccer game played with RC cars. Obviously, the goal is to get the ball into the opponents net. Cars are given a few abilities to mix up the game. They can easily scale and drive on walls, and even up side down on the roof for a period of time (or longer with enough turbo). Boost or turbo is another feature in game. To acquire turbo, players must drive over small hot spots spread throughout the terrain. Some hot spots give minor turbo boosts while others will fill up the gauge all the way. Boosts when timed correctly, can produce a power hit on the ball. Some boosts when held down for a certain amount of time engage in some sort of ultra speed. When going this fast and if a player is in your way, you have the ability to literally run through and destroy the opponent. I am a huge fan of games which feature double jump, and rocket league has it! The first jump is a bit of a slow jump, while the second provides for another boost upwards, forwards, to the side or in reverse. While in the air, the player has quite a bit of flexibility to move about. This trick comes in hand when attempting to defend or attempting to knock the ball in an awkward angle. It can look pretty cool when done right. There are no power-ups within the games so this fact alone may turn a few people away from the game... this is only of course if you play competitive. Non-competitive games feature power-ups. None the less, the devs took a simplistic approach to keep the game engaging. The matchmaking that is available is organized very neatly and local co-op is an extremely appreciated feature. Matchmaking is a bit funny to me in the sense where if only four players are available, it will add two AI's instead of allowing for a 2v2 vote. Again, it's not a big deal as empty slots are filled up with AI's (sometimes extremely annoying AI's that score on themselves). This however only applies in non-competitive mode which for the most part is ok. A neat feature is there is an arrow that indicates where the ball is off screen. Additionally, there is a circle marker on the ball to show where and how far up in the air is the ball. Players can press Y to change the camera view off the car and toward the ball. The player can also choose to toggle the lock button for the camera.Graphics are well done and nothing seems cut short. You can optimize for performance or quality (whoot whoot)! There are different stages in the game but they are limited (or I should say were limited). A few more ""out of this world"" stages have been added for free which is greatly appreciated. The customizations regarding the cars are absolutely well done. From custom paint jobs, custom wheels, to even custom hats (that for some weird reason keep your goal count). My only complaint if I can have one is the DLC purchases for new car skins... but hey, who am I to judge. The menu's and the UI was also well done and everything is kept simple and neat. The music and sounds in game have improved since it's start. I love how different boosts all have a different sound and some even play music. This is really paying attention to detail. The sound tracks in general are pretty catchy. That could be part in fact I've also heard them numerous times.The game is quite exciting and cars seemingly fly everywhere. It's enjoyable when everyone crashes into the ball, but it is even more delightful when people start calculating hits and play positions.For future Rocket League DLC's or games, it would be nice to see some mini-games! The main part of the game is excellent, but imagine adding some modifications to it. Perhaps adding power-ups could give an alternative to matchmaking.Overall good game, and I would recommend it to most people. There are a few friends that are reluctant to get into it, but for the most part it has received positive reception.***Dec 2016 update : there are new game modes that involve other sports such as hockey or basket ball. I think this is a neat step as it creates many new opportunities. They are not available in competitive mode, but are still very fun to play. You're essentially a flying projectile whenever you wish. When you get the hang of flying, this game's opportunities start flying wide open. Very simplistic game but you can definitely see the skill range of some players is phenomenal. Unlike FIFA where you would get discouraged, I'm sure you'll start challenging yourself when you see some of these crayz stunts.RATING : 8.1/10 Gameplay A Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability A Overall  A-ScreenShots :  Riding upside down on the roof. There is an arrow to the left of my car to indicate where the ball is Usual start to a rocket league game  You can use your boost to fly through the air. You can also modify the color and type of boost that comes from the car Coming in for a one timer at full speed  Ain't easy being the best  ",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

Rocket League > League of LegendsRocket League is the best League-----------------A stranger once said to me, in response to the above statement:""oh yeah, thats why in twitch you can see more than 200k viewers on lol and 50k on rocket""To him, or any other who has similar remarks, I proclaim the following words:""Greatness is not measured in viewer counts or player amounts.Greatness, my friends, is measured in leagues""Truth be told, there is no game that can compare to the glorious, magnificent experience that is Rocket League. This masterpiece is truly in a league of its own.Furthermore, before any of you cast forth accusations upon me, I can assure you, I am not in league with those who developed this supreme, rocket-powered work of exquisitely coordinated, flashing pixels.-----------------Ok you know what? forget the formalities and proper grammar. Imma shoot straight with you. If you thought you could just buy the game and top the leaderboards in a day, you. thought. wrong.The journey's gonna be harder than that trek from a toilet-paperless dump to that stack of extra rolls in your basement in the middle of the night with the lights out.Most of the ppl you meet will be way out of your league, and its gonna take guts, practice, and a controller if you want to make it anywhere. So Stand Tall. Stand Proud.So Sit Down. On Your Butt.Idle In That Menu.Listen To That Soundtrack.Join That Game.And Get Rekt Make That Ball Go Boom.			",177,16,6,5,9,3,16

												I love this game!  Soccer/Football in RC cars with jets strapped to their back and an exploding ball.  The controls are tight, the action intense and it's a pulse pounding thrill ride even when you lose.Don't get me wrong, just like with real soccer/football it's easy to play but difficult to play well.  But the training gives you the tools, you just need to practice. Highly recommended for anyone who likes action packed games with high speed thrills and crazy crashes.  Remember when you were a kid and you were practicing catching high fly balls?  How you had to practice getting under it and timing it just right?  Get ready for that with jet cars.

												I don't like soccer. I don't like cars. I love Rocket League!Even with no interest whatsoever in the theme, I find Rocket League excellent as a game. Easy to learn, hard to master. It doesn’t start dull, it is fun right from the start as a beginner, and it only gets better as you improve.It involves a very wide range of skills which gives the gameplay a lot of variety by constantly engaging your different abilities. I don’t mean variety as in different environments or doing different things, rather the variety applies to the ways in which the game demands your participation both physically (mechanical skills, accuracy, timing, consistency, …) and mentally (spatial awareness, intuition for the game’s physics like momentum or bounces, team coordination, …), pretty much like a real sport. This makes it one of the most fulfilling video games to play.Rocket League is the video game that feels the closest to real life sports. It involves the same kind of skills and provides the same kind of fun. Absolutely recommended to everyone!			",140,23,4,3,10,0,26

If you want to end up going bald because you're all stressed out, then this is your game. If you want to rip your skin off since you're always saying ""one last match"" but you keep playing against the same ♥♥♥♥ers, then this is your game. Long story short, you're going to absolutely love this game even if you want to commit suicide at the end of every match.			",192,92,9,15,19,3,13

Rocket League is a well-made mix between racing and soccer genre. If you are subscribed to any of gaming Youtube channels or websites, you are probably already familiar with the game and you know that there is quite a lot of hype about it. And that hype is not unjustified.If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end. What is happening in the game:You are in control of a car and your mission is to score enough goals to win the match with other players. You can play multiplayer (with actual people) or singleplayer (with bots). Also, there is a freeplay mode for you to sharpen your skills.Pros: The way this game looks is astonishing. Grass, cars, turbo effects, the ball, the arena ... they really look good. I mean, look at the Store page screenshots! Multiple game modes for both online and offline playing (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4). Ranked cannot be 4v4, however. If you play on ""Unfair"" difficulty against bots, you can also play 1v2, 1v3 and 1v4. There is a tutorial in this game and unlike some other games, you can actually learn stuff from this one. For basic playing, there is a short tutorial just explaining how to move and jump, but if you have time and will to take your playing technique to the next level, this is taken care of by more advanced tutorials. This is probably one of rare games where you actually want to play tutorial multiple times. Car handling is near-perfect, it really goes where you want it to go. Also, you can drive one the walls, fly and even drive upside down on the arena ceiling for a short time. A very special thing in this game is so-called ""Ball View"", where camera is always pointing towards the camera. You can turn it on and off at appropriate times to maximize your efficiency while trying to hit the ball into opponents' net. Car customization content is absurd. You get hundreds of wheels, antennas, hats, car types ... you are guaranteed to find a combination that suits you. Next thing about car customization is how you unlock parts. This is the best way I've seen it handled: you get something for every single match you play. Yes, you've heard right. No matter what you play, with bots with real people, 1v1, you always get something. After playing every match, you also get a chance to save a replay of the game you have just played. These saved games can be then watched from perspectives of all players, there is also a free camera mode. Matchmaking seems to be working well, I've never been in a match that would be completely unfair or unbalanced. The soundtrack is amazing, it consists of 11 songs that are also available on Amazon[www.amazon.com] and iTunes[itunes.apple.com]. You get XP even for playing with bots, but you get only 50% of you would get with playing online. Still, it's a great way to encourage people to play more. You also get some XP for losing. This thing runs great even on old computers and you don't even have to have all the setting set to low! The community is really active, there are almost five thousand threads created on Steam Discussions, there are tons of Youtube videos and streamers playing it.Cons: Only occasional lags when playing online. Also, sometimes servers are dead for a minute, but that only happened twice to me. Not a problem at all. There is PS4 support, but no Linux and MacOS? Come on!The final verdict:With practically no bad sides and tons of good stuff in this game, I certainly recommend it to everyone, not just fans of soccer or racing. I'm not a big fan of either of them, but I enjoy this game a great deal. You can customize your car in more than 10 billion combinations, the game really encourages you to play and the feeling when you play is amazing. This is certainly one of the best games released this year. There are so many people playing all the time, there are streams, Youtube videos, tons of discussions, simply amazing. You can't be sure how long is this going to last for, so try grabbing it as soon as it gets any discount or even now, as it is certainly worth the full 20$ price tag.Greetings,BirdCuteNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

												ABOUT THE GAME :Rocket League is a Soccer inspired sports game made by Psyonix. In this game you use a car to hit around a large ball into a goal, pretty much Soccer with cars.

												This is my experience after playing the game for the first time with a friend:- got game, made party, got into a casual 2v2 match- 2 a.m., window wide open - forgot- start match- 30 minutes of rage/joy/fun/screaming- someone starts bashing on my front door- figure it's downstairs neighbour- go silent, ignore- still bashing- still silent/ignore- almost breaks down my door- have to open, see who it is- see cops, jail imminent- panic- open door, act nice- cop says he heard me down on the street in his car with his windows closed- start ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting him, I say the neighbour usually warns me first before calling the cops- cop says it wasn't the downstairs neighbour who called, but the one in the BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET- almost start laughing- cop asks WTF was I doing- start ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting him again- he asks why I have the window open- say I totally forgot- he asks: ""What game are you playing?""- he knows.- I ask: ""Is that a serious question?""- he says: ""Don't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t me, I've been a gamer for 15 years - what game?""- I say: ""Rocket League.""- he gives me a slight smile/nod of approval/understanding- HE KNOWS.- gives me back my ID: ""Keep the noise down, goodnight.""911/10 would be arrested again.

												What I thought was the worst concept EVER (really? Football and Cars together? Come on.. anyone?) ended up being one of the most addictive games I’ve come to cross around.PROS-Everyone is on the same page. There is no difference in XP, Cars, Skins or anything. SKILLS are everything-Very fluid-No bugs (at least I haven’t found one)-Multi-Platform-Coop and Local CoopCONS-NO OFFLINE LAN. That kind of sucks… really. This would be a reason to NOT RECOMMEND a good game, but this game is pretty great, so I still give it a recommend (Oh yeah, I wan’t to hear those brats from US and EU talk about how everyone got internet now and we don’t need LAN Anymore, and this is a stupid complain.. please go ahead) -Servers give a connection problem all the time. I asked a lot of people, and I am getting the same answer from at least 40% of the people. Maybe is just here in South America, and playing with servers outside the ping goes over 200. The good thing is that the game does not become totally unplayable, especially for new, not all that skilled players (like myself :D)-No the best Match Making system ever, but this is not a Con per say… just not so great yet I thinkBut really. Awesome game. Worth the full price. Tell your friends and Rocket!  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rocket League...The game that took the gaming scene by surprise. Personally, I don't enjoy car games, racing games, or sports games. Especially not soccer. Then why does this game interest me so much?I have no idea. Nevertheless, I haven't been able to play hardly any other games for my newfound love for thrust sticks attached to what look like toy cars. You'll start out jump-flipping into the ball, and being amazed at how you hit it just right to make your first goal. Then you'll experiment with boosting after you jumped. ""I hit it!"" you say. Finally, you were able to touch the ball while it soars 50 feet above the ground. As you cascade to the field, you realize that the death-defying acrobatic maneuver was just enough to tip the ball into your goal ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I couldn't recommend this game any more if I tried. Buy this game right now. You will never regret it.This is one of the most entertaining, fun, and addictive games I've ever played. Just like its predecessor, this game provides hours upon hours of entertainment. The physics are superb, the gameplay is easy to pick up and thrilling to master, and it looks beautiful. It's a game that definitely gets better as you improve, which makes it more and more fun as you play it. There's something extremely addicitve about playing football/soccer with cars, and with the addition of boost, acrobatics, and flying, it just never stops being fun. It's one of those games where you always say ""one more game"" over and over again. There's plenty of different gamemodes to play, including season mode, drill training, online ranked, unranked, private, split-screen, split-screen online, and a bunch more. Pros: The game looks beautiful The physics are spot on, so the game relies entirely on your own skill, with no automatic passing and shooting. You're on your own, which makes making saves and scoring goals so much more satisfying. It's so addictive...like really addictive...like ""oh my god is it 5am already?"" addictive. It's incredibly well optimised, as evident by the generous system requirements. You don't need a fantastic PC to play this game on high settings, but it still looks and plays beautifully at 60fps with not-as-good PCs There is a bunch of customisation features, including body types, skins, hats, boost trails, tires, and whatnot. Rank-based matchmaking, so you actually play people of similar ability, rather than being bored getting thrashed or thrashing other players There's cross-play with PS4 users It's a fantastic party game to play with your friends on split-screen, or online The gameplay is flawless, making it really easy for new players to pick up, but allowing for an insanely high skill ceiling where the top players can really pull of some amazing skillsCons: It will ruin other aspects of your life, such as your social life and work life with its addictiveness.Score: 11/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rocket League is a rare example where the execution of a simple, absurd idea is so strong and so engaging that it doesn’t need a ton of extra features around it. The rush of ripping across the pitch at full turbo to deny a shot on goal with a clutch bicycle-kick is enough to bring me back time and time again for just “one more match,” even without meaningful progression systems. Rocket League is a great, goofy, easy to learn and difficult to master action-sports game which demands that you grab a few friends and play a few rounds			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												you know the game is worthy when it's on r/placeThe rocket league life - 1 You purchase the game, very skeptical and maybe you might refund, it's just a soccer game with cars, right?2 You play a few matches and whiff 75% of time even when the balls not moving. You also have terrible camera settings, camera shake, and whatever else enabled.3 Someone tells you about kronovi or jhzer. 4 Your whole perspective on this ""simple"" car game changes, ""what the hell is an aerial? how did he do that?""5 you learn new tricks.6 you strive to be the best.7 you continue playing for many, many, hours and get angry when you lose8 you exit the game one day after a few months of playing and notice you have 800 hours. repeat from 5 and multiply the hours by 2Wow!Wow!Wow!Calculated.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(natively from xbox, and proud to say it's my most played game on console.)but, console doesn't do justice with locked 30fps on a game like this. Once you play this with 60-144+ fps, you'll never be able to go back to 30fps without feeling like every car is a Merc.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Everything is perfect about it, I wouldn't change a thing about gameplay, it's that good. Amazingly fun game to play but even more fun, to me, is watching pros like Dirkend, Law, Tree, Kronovi, Gibbs, and sorry if I missed anyone that streamed beta/preview and actually has shown what are the game's possibilities. With that being said, I think and really hope that this game will become one of next E-sports big things, it certainly would be lots of fun for the audience. I'll give it 10/10 for the game, rate a lot lower for community because people that are leaving games a lot, but hopefully that will get changed.Definitely recommending it			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You never know how much fun a game can be until you actually try it.  Yeah, you hear all the glowing reviews, but sometimes you need to experience it for yourself.  So I bought the game, on sale for $11.20 (USD), and was able to quickly find a friend to play with.  The first thing I did was try the tutorial, which impressed me on how tight and responsive the conrols are.  That was a really good sign for a sport where control is necessary.  Next we jumped into an match with easy bots and I scored a goal in the first 4 seconds.  OK, I was not expecting that to feel so satisfying.  That was the exact point that the hook was set.  It is not easy to score goals.  You wait back at midfield for the right time to speed burst towards a centered pass only to see it go wide or deflect off another player.  You circle back and try to attack again and again.  Time goes by, and then you find yourself colliding with a teammate and happen to bump into the ball that trickles just fast enough to cross the goal line before the opponent can fly over to stop it.  The feeling of triumph floods over you and you cannot stop your grin from growing over your face. I am not even 2 hours in at this point and I already see the promise this game holds.  The potential for great fun with friends is there, and that's the key.  I find myself looking forward to my next match.  I can't wait to get out there and drive around like a crazed lunatic and smash some buddies into the wall.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Cars playing soccer/footballBut wait! There is more:Even though on the first look this game's concept appears simple and goofy, the depth of gameplay found here is insanely high. Rocket League is one of those games which allow you to do amazing plays and moves if you dedicated time and effort into it, but at the same time provide a lot of fun while played casually with friends.What to expectThis game is the sequel to the PS3 game Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars from 2008. Therefore the game idea isn't new and the gameplay doesn't differ a lot. But since the same developer Psyonix stay behind Rocket League, their experience allowed them to address problems and improve the game (as well as shorten the name :P).Rocket League provides fast 5 minute rounds inside a box-shaped arena. The edges of the arena are curved to allow players to drive up walls and even on the ceiling. The team size can range from one to four players on each team.The gameplay is fast and because of the playingfield's small size goals can be scored from the other side of it, since there are no obstacles in the way other than a potentional defending player. Blocking the ball and doing a counterattack right afterwards happens within seconds and can turn an entire game.The carsThere are multiple car models to choose from, but their handling or top speed does not differ. Only the hitbox of the cars are slighly different - which creates some tiny variation in the ball interaction. However the main purpose of having multiple cars is to customize it without interfering or imbalancing the gameplay. This works very well and choosing a car is a personal preference rather than a statistical battle to determine which car is the best. The car customization comes with color, surface type, additional decal, wheels, antenna, goofy hats and particles for the rocket trail.""Rocket trail?"" you may ask. Well, in Rocket League every car has a Rocket Engine attached to its back allowing to boost itself to greater speed. The best part is that you can jump and shoot yourself into the air with it and being able to fly. This creates gameplay in all three dimensions. Instead of just dribbling the ball on the ground, you can launch yourself into the air and hit the ball before your enemy can. It is not easy and adds a decent learning-curve to the game.The experienceThe game is very polished. The options menu allows key rebinding serparatly for keyboard and controller, very in-depth adjustments to the camera position/behaviour as well as a large choice of grafic options for the Unreal Engine 3.Textures are very detailed, particle effects very well made. The grass on the ground is fantastically animated. Even though the arena/stadiums are the same, there are four different theme versions, ranging from a raining indoor park to a full blown stadium with thousand of people cheering.The cars handle very well, can turn fast and stick to the ground unless you want and tell them to drift. Once airborne keeping the control of the car or wanting to do what you want is difficult but not impossible. The physic engine of the game does it's work very well. The ball itself is predictable and doesn't behave random at all.You unlock new parts for your car customization after completing each game - no matter the outcome of the match. The account progress is ok, but nothing incredible or important. This game shines when it comes to it's gameplay.The sound effects as well as grafical effects while playing or just driving around are incredible enjoyable. Boosting to full speed makes you feel powerful, ramming people and even destroying them creates satisfing explosions. And when scoring a goal the ball explodes and creates a shockwave on which you can ride on with your rocket launcher. Directly afterwards you get a replay of the goal in slow motion. At the end of the game you can save a replay of the entire game and watch it whenever you want.Setting up goals and blocking the ball also feel rewarding by the system and on a team-spirit basis.Since the game has high skill ceiling, experienced players can crush any other ones. The matchmaking system works very well in that regard, that you get matched up with equally good players and even indicates if it doesnt find them and slowly extends it's skill range in order to find players as fast as possible. You can group up to play together in normal and ranked games.You also have the choice of selecting multiple regional servers such as Europe, Oceanic, West- and East-America, as well as queueing up for multiple modes (e.g. 1vs1 and 3v3) at the same time. The game will put you in the first fitting game it can find for you.The game also provides a singleplayer campaign against the AI, as well as tutorials and training for various parts of the game such as defending the goal and scoring goals. For those who just want to get used to the controls or test can hop into the sandbox mode.I also like to mention that you can queue up for an online game from any menu or singleplayer gamemode. So while searching you can play around in sandbox mode.Downloadable Content (Supersonic Fury DLC Update)As announced by Psyonix, the first major update hit Rocket League. I first was disappointed that they want to go the DLC route. Not because i dont like to pay for content, but more because of the bad reputation the word 'DLC' has nowadays, fearing that Rocket League gets looked down for doing this markt strategie. But my fear should vanish.The first DLC just includes two new car and customization items for a small price. The real update includes free stuff for everyone. New map, new specator mode, better ranked play, improved main menu background, and so on. With the new update the 20€ i pay for the game are even more worth it. And Psyonix plans are to keep going, maybe even into the direction of modding and crazy maps.So yes. I am excited for every upcomming Update and DLC.ConclusionI recommend this game to everyone. May it be casual players, those who play in a group to have fun together as well as the ones who like play competitively. Playing this game has the perfect fun/frustration balance and great learning curve.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
