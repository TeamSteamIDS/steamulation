												This ""game"" is terrible. There is no menu screen, you just spawn and the same 3 or 4 aliens keep attacking you. The teleporting doesn't work half the time. The guns are ridiculous. There doesn't seem to be a real objective. Once you die, you respawn somewhere else and the cycle starts all over. This isn't a game. Its just a bunch of non-sense.It seems like something a student half built in algorithms class and uploaded it to steam thinking it was good enough.Its not even worth the $1.79 I paid for it.			"
