								Super fun! We just take turns trying to out do each other. This really feels like you are flying through the air.  The mechanics seem to reward you for precise launches and height of jump. We have put lots of our friends through and everyone enjoys it. Nice work.			"

								The concept is good but it needs more work to add some competitiveness. There are a few bugs too. Its promising but honestly i would wait for more content, a few game modes and the bugs to be fixed.			"
