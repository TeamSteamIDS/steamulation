												Extremly simple physics based 'ball' game. The presentation is neat, but that's about all going for the game. The game itself is bland, very bland. You control three Adorables that can shoot in a direction of your choice in turns. Your opponent has another three Adorables that do the same. There are three modes that are essentially the same: Soccer, Ice Hockey and Beach Ball. Then there's Last Man Standing and Mummy (which are basically the same thing). The last mode is capture the flag. All modes play almost the same and there are no specials to lighten up the rather boring game play.If you like very simple turned based physics games this might be worth to pick up in a sale or a bundle, but otherwise I wouldn't bother to get it.

												It might be fun if I played it on my smartphone while being bored in a bus. It is no fun at all playing it on Steam.There are 6 minigames in total in Adorables: soccer, beach ball, hockey, capture the flag, push off opponents to water and running away from a mummy. Soccer, beach ball and hockey can be considered as one minigame since the only difference is a friction of a ground (the ball and creatures moves faster or slower). Scoring in these requires more luck than skills. Capture the flag, pushing off and mummy are slightly more interesting, though after a moment it is way too easy to win.Yes, AI sucks badly in this game. Opponents follow blindly ball putting it to their own goals or in case of a hockey, they stuck behind goals unable to move. If you actually want to spend 2,99€ for this game, I strongly recommend getting it for absolutely free from Google Play.			"

Boring game. It's like a mobile game that I won't even play on a mobile!The gameplay is extremely boring. There are two teams of three players each and you just have to click on each of the members of your team and choose a direction. Then click the Play button and the members will move in the said direction. Keep doing this over and over again till you complete the goal of the game three times where the goal depends on the game (Ice Hockey, Capture the Flag, Soccer, etc).Very repetitive.Even the music is so repetitive that it becomes irritating.Also it requires like 9hrs to get all the card drops.

Cute carrom-based strategy game for all ages- You control a team of 3 players, where the aim is to beat the other team. You do this by specifying in each turn, how you want your 3 players to move. - There are a few different game types to choose from: e.g. soccer, ice hockey, capture the flag, escape the mummy, knock your opponent into the water, etc, and you can choose to play in practice mode, online vs, hotseat, world tournament, etc. - The goals of each game differ depending on the type of game you select. E.g. In ""capture the flag"", you must get to the other team's home base, steal their flag, and bring it back to your base, while making your own flag isn't captured first. And in ""escape the mummy"", you must try to make the mummy turn all the players on your opponent's team into mummies themselves, while making sure you have at least 1 player still alive on your own team.Game mechanics- Movement is free anywhere within the game board as long as there are no obstacles in the way.- On each turn, you can specify 1 linear direction in which you want your player to move, as well as the amount of force.- You can also choose not to move any of your players per turn.- If players bump into objects (i.e. game board items and other players), they will rebound. - I had no problems at all playing this game using my mouse, on my laptop.StrategyWhile kids may enjoy the cute graphics & sound and appreciate the simple physics involved, more mature players soon realise that, in order to win, you have to take into account how the other team is going to move, and also in which direction all players will ""rebound"" when they hit stuff. Different game types require different methods of strategising. E.g. In ""capture the flag"", you may find it beneficial to not move 1 of your players and have it permanently stationed at your home base instead.ConclusionAdorables operates fundamentally like carrom, but with more options and a variety of interesting contexts.This really is an adorable game that I would recommend to both kids & adults alike. I can see kids enjoying the colourful, cute characters and interface, and adults having fun thinking up various strategies to beat each game type.   Disclaimer: Game received for free, thanks to my dear friend Unpageable. :)  "

												This game has everything! For 2.99$ you will get much fun. I recommend this,it's better with friends.Thing i don't like is that,soccer,hockey and beach ball are almost same. And there could be music when you play a match. Other things are good,customization is good.It would also be good if you guys add some more maps.			"

												This game is good.The gameplay is good. You can be happy because the game is funny, but you can be mad easily because sometimes/always the bots go face to face so you can't move. And the worst one is the ice hockey because bots never go for the ball if that is behind the gate so you have to go there, this is the gratest disadvantage of the game.And you can do all achievements but you have to play a lot because you have to earn money in the game.And you can get trading cards.

My playtime: 9h (based on steam)Grindy Achievement: yes (6h+)Developer Response: ~1 weekIntroAdorables is a collection of 6 mini games which starred a group of cute creatures called ""Adorables"". The game can only be played with a mouse although you can use keyboard to navigate through the menu.MusicThe music sounds pleasant and reminds me of world cup's song. Maybe this is influenced by the game which has a lot of ball games in it (and one mode with Europe cup theme).GraphicsThe graphics are decent, although the settings page can be quite annoying. It took several clicks just to go back to main menu after you buy eyes, mouth, or hat parts. Although you can costumize all of your Adorables appearance (even its body shape and color), most of the hat parts cover the Adorables' face although i love seeing their cute faces. More variation for the hat parts which doesn't cover the Adorables' face would be appreciated.The gameThere are several modes in the game, which are:- Practice, where you will be playing with CPU in 1 round- Continental Contest, where you will be playing soccer game in a bracket preliminaries mode and then moving to tournament mode in 7 rounds total- Tournament, where you will be playing single type game in a tournament elimination mode in 4 rounds- World Tour, where you will be playing all game in 1 round each, totalling in 6 rounds- Online, where you'll be playing in multiplayer with internet connection- Hot Seat where you will be playing with your friends locallyAlthough there are lots of game mode in this game, you'll mostly play either Continental Contest or Tournament because they will give you coins which can be used to customize your Adorables.The Online feature is terrible as you have to input the host IP to join a game. It also lag endlessly when i try to host a game, which forces me to restart my computer.There are several games in this game, with 3 being ball games and 3 being non ball games. The ball games work the same way like each other (move the ball to the goal), except that the ball has different size and weight with a different goal placement. The Ice Hockey game can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥because the AI will act weirdly whenever the puck is going behind the goal. The small puck size also makes the game to be hard to finish, as the game will be finished whenever a team scored 3 points.The game is played in turn, where you will be given a chance to move your three Adorables by using your mouse to drag them to move to the said location with a certain speed (the longer the line you drag, the faster it will move). After you finished positioning them, you can confirm your selection and the round will start. The game will keep on continuing until one team scores three points first (or based on time limit, if you are playing Continental Contest in bracket preliminaries) for the ball game. For the non ball game, the objectives will depend on the game. For Last Adorables Stand, you'll win if your team is the last one to stand. For Capture The Flag, you'll win if you place enemies' flag in your place before your enemies do the same thing with your flag. For Mummy, you'll win if at least one of your team survive from the mummies.If you think that the turn based move is too slow, you can activate a speed mode, which will remove the turn based mode and change it to real time based. However, you'll get a disadvantage, especially in ball games, because the AI will be able to move three Adorables at once while you only can do once (unless you can figure out how to click and drag at three different points in the screen at once). The mechanism that your Adorables will get stunned if they are hit by other Adorables also can make it worse. However, the game will end faster in this mode, which could make the game to be lively.Although the game might be frustating at first, it will be enjoyable as soon as you learned how to play it. However, the game can be boring soon after that because it mostly will do the same thing (especially if you played it too many times at once).Pros:- 6 game modes- 6 game types- Customizable Adorables- Speed mode to fast things upCons:- It can be boring when it's played too oftenConclusionThis is a bunch of minigames with cute creatures on it.Should you buy this game?Yes.That's if you like to play minigames. If you are the type who got bored fast, you better skip it. If you like minigames and planned to play this not too often, you can buy it. However, i'll recommend you to buy it when it's on sale. "

												At first 15 minutes I though ""wow, this game was for free and it's not total crap"".But!I played more and I realized it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mobile game. All you do is with mouse.Music is very annoying and during match the sounds are terrifying - it's very 'noisy' (like white noise).There is no multiplayer online, so you can't even compete with your friends.Also - for such easy game it has many bugs - wrong displayment of country (when pointing the flag). Broken timer (0:09 time would be shown as 0:9)...Sorry, but game is not worth playing in this state! Do some changes and maybe I will change my mind and review.			"

												Adorables is an uninspired phone game ported poorly to the PC.It's a turn-based physics game, but even with its asynchronous ""Speed game"" mode it has little to offer. Half of the available sports based gamemodes are essentially identical with varying goal rules and friction, and the rest are CTF and last man standing versions of tag and pushing opponents out of the map. You only get a single map per gamemode and all units play the same. There is a wide selection of cosmetic items to pick from, but that's where your ability to choose more or less ends. The graphics are bland and characters only have two frames of animation at best, sound design is minimal to non-existant, controls an UI aren't changed much from its mobile counterpart and the SteamOS, Linux port is, akin to the game itself, very half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥It's forgivable for the trading cards or to grind for easy achievments, but considering how unfinished it seems, it's hard to recommend this at any price.

Lots of customization, achievements to keep things interesting.   All in all a fun little diversion. A surprising thumbs up!Edit - I have had the game crash a few times in the World Tour mode, not consistently though.Edit 2 - I've had a few more odd bugs occur, a little annoying at times but usually clear up with a game restart.  Also, some of the achievements will take a looooooonnnnng time to get; but I still find the game a good diverson, easy to play a short while and I feel like I will come back to this every so often for a round or two.

												(Ignore the time spent on this game.  A minimum of 15 of the hours spent on this game were spent idling for the trading cards)(This game has been suggested by Zaraki Snakenoman and provided by ""Original Giveaway Group"".  Thanks, guys.)Just like Boring Man, this game's name redefines the game's namesake.   This game is ugly and boring, simply put.  Yet another free game that's overpriced on Steam.What are you in store for you in this $3 game?  Here are your modes in a nutshell:King of the Hill (Push the enemies off the platform)SoccerIce Soccer (Hockey)Beach SoccerCapture the flagAvoid the infectedThere are two ways to play, normal (which requires you to strategically predict or sabotage your enemy's gameplay) and Speed (where your moves are live time).Don't let this ""Variety"" fool you, it's boring.  Very boring with easy achievements (...unlocking cosmetics is going to take a LOT of grinding though).  What are these cosmetics?  Hats, eyes, mouths, and shapes give you achievements.  Colors can also be bought, but they won't give you any achievements.  Keep in mind you only get about 70-80 gold per victory...Is there any reason to recommend this game?  Not unless you just want easy achievements (albeit grindy).1/10			"

												Adorables is a very simple physics ball game with nice graphics and cute little ""Adorables"". You can change the color of your characters at the beginning of the game. After you've won some money, you can change the shape of your adorables , buy a different eye and/or mouth and also buy a hat, bow or horns. There are severals different sporting events, Soccer, Beach Soccer and Ice Hockey. There is also Capture the Flag, Last Adorable Standing, and The Mummy. Your 3 Adorables are controlled by assigning each a direction in which to launch via an arrow attached to them. The speed and distance in which the Adorable will launch is decided by how long or short you stretch the arrow. They can also be banked off the sides, knock each other and the ball around, kind of like playing pool. Its a fun little game, but can become repetitive. If you like very simple physics games, I'd wait to get it on sale or in a bundle.			"

 #LittleLycanOnSteam   Hello Reader  , If You Are Reading This Review, Don't Keep Your Hopes High As It's Not A Review As Such But My Feelings About Any Games Including This One. I May Have Played Or Not Played This Game, Still I Will UpVote It As I Know How Much Efforts, Blood And Sweat Is Used To Make Any Sort Of Game, Irrespective To Big Or Small, Branded Or Small Devs. I Personally Do Not Have Time To Play All Games, So I Just Idle Them, No Offence, Just For The Cards But I Know That The Game Is Worth Shot Even If Not Worth Our Time As It Requires Tremendous Efforts To Make Even The Simplest Of All Games. God Bless All The Game Developers, You Guys Are Great Because You Guys Make Games And Games Are Life For Gamers And Stressbuster For The Working People. Thank You!- #LittleLycanOnky #January2017			"

												This is some kiddy game where you play soccer or hockey or volleyball but they're all the same weird ""fling your body at the ball and hope for the best"" thing. There are like six modes and they're all more or less exactly the same except for one where you are a mummy. It's dumb, it's pretty obviously for kids and doesn't try to hide that it was originally a mobile game. And let's be real here, this would be a subpar mobile game.Or in other words, this is a bad game because most mobile games are complete trash and this is a lower tier kind of trash. It's like old food that you'd find under a dumpster. Not the food you'd actually find in a dumpster. Less than that. (honestly if you had a kid they'd probably enjoy it on a mobile device and it would make them stop talking about cannibals and pirates or whatever kids talk about these days.)

												It's very fun! It's simple, the only mechanic is to litterally click on your 3 Adorables and drag a direction where you want to go, sorta like angry bird (As in the swipe). The actual games are very fun. You got Soccer, which is basic soccer, CTF, which you just capture a flag, Ice hockey, just ice hockey, mummy, if you touch the mummy you get infected lose control over that character and if you touch one of those the same happens.A few more that I can't remember so ok then.I got this for free, I am very happy I got this free.

												A cute little remake of Cestos (which itself was likely a remake of something), but flawed in its current state.Like Cestos, the basic thrust of this game revolves around sliding little blobs around on a playfield and bumping them into each other. One mode - Last Adorables Standing - is exactly like Cestos, in that you're trying to knock the other guy's blobs off the edge of the playfield, except there's only one map here, which is a bit of a disappointment - it's not like these playfields are terribly complicated to come up with once the basic engine is written.Three of these modes (Soccer, Volleyball, and Ice Hockey) involve a ""ball"" and a ""goal"". The only difference between Soccer and Volleyball is that in Soccer, the ball is slightly smaller, and your players can be knocked through the goal and off the map. Ice Hockey reduces the friction a little and puts the goals slightly closer together to create some ""dead space"" behind each goal, but it's generally the same concept.The two remaining modes are a bit different: Capture the Flag is, well, Capture the Flag, where touching a flag-carrier in the central section of the map ""steals"" the flag. ""Mummy"" is best described as ""Zombie tag"" - an AI-controlled Mummy tries to knock into both players' blobs, and once a blob is touched by the Mummy it becomes a Mummy too, targeting whatever blobs remain. Unfortunately, the asymmetrical map here gives one side a permanent advantage. The Capture the Flag map is also asymmetrical, though it's slightly harder to decide which side is favored.Games can be played as ""practice"" (skirmishes), a ""World Cup"" event where you play the Soccer mode using World Cup rules (group stages, then I assume a tournament), a ""Tournament"" mode where you can choose the game mode, and a ""Story"" mode which is pretty much just one skirmish after another. Online and hotseat multiplayer modes round out the bill.So, that's the basics, so far so good, for the most part. However, now the problems begin to surface.There is no matchmaking for online play. I don't just mean that there's no ELO or similar system to organize balanced matches - I mean that there's not even a server browser. Unless you and your friend(s) share your I.P. addresses, there's no way to play anything other than single-player or hot-seat.Single-player is also flawed - for the most part, the A.I. just simplistically charges at the nearest valid target. In some modes (particularly Capture the Flag), this is randomized a bit, but it's still pretty basic. With such a variety of game-modes, many of them organized around the concept of ""teams"", it would seem natural to vary things a bit - some teams aggressively charging, other teams focusing more on repositioning themselves to secure an advantage. As far as I can tell, this isn't happening, and each A.I. team plays pretty much the same.Customizing your little Adorables is done from a separate menu at the start of the game, with various cosmetics unlocked with in-game currency earned from winning matches. Customization is nice, but I think it's a bit of a missed opportunity - my Practice Soccer team will look the same as my Tournament Volleyball team, and changing the looks requires backing all the way out to the main menu. I think it might be more interesting if the non-practice modes had their own separate player-teams, so a Story mode team starts off as just a bunch of generic Adorables and earns their own unlocks separately from the default team.The sound is atrocious. A five second loop of background noises (birds for soccer, crashing waves for the ship setting of the Capture the Flag and Last Adorable Standing modes, and so on), with occasional sped-up ""oh no!"" ""goal!"" and similar vocalizations.The GUI is a bit finicky - you navigate by clicking on a ""<"" and a "">"", but the hitboxes for those symbols only cover the intersection. If you click too far to the ""open"" side, you just end up selecting whatever mode is currently highlighted. Probably just as bad on the touchscreens this game is clearly designed for.Finally, as far as I can tell, none of the longer modes saves your progress. If you want to play the World Cup mode, I really hope you love soccer, because you're going to have to play a crapload of matches in one sitting. Does your friend want to play a quick match? Too bad, you can't start up a quick multiplayer game without losing all your progress.The individual modes themselves also suffer from various less-obvious game-design flaws - for instance, the timed modes run off an actual continuously-running timer, rather than a set number of turns, which has the consequence of encouraging players to not actually click ""ready/end-turn"" and just wait out the turn limit timer so they can milk the game clock. I imagine this would be really tiresome when playing online multiplayer. The ""speed mode"" tries to alleviate this, but really just turns the game into frenzied clicking instead, desperately trying to set move orders - any move orders at all - in the tiny window of time you're allowed. Really, a turn limit (game ends in X turns) rather than time limit (game ends in X:XX) is the way to go with this.All in all, there's potential for fun here - especially for those of us who loved Cestos back in the day - but it's still a major update or two away.

												Adorables is a mixed, yet leaning towards yes, game in my eyes.It's a lot of fun to play from time to time, yet not vey fun in long bursts. As fun as it is, it's very easy to tell that everything but the visuals was done very low-budget and was rushed. The game plays fine, but somethig about it just fells like it could and should be done better. maybe it's that animation feels stiff or unfitting to the gameplay, maybe it's that the pacing of the game is just really slow, maybe it's the mobile buttons all around the game, there's just something about it I dont like. However, this game has variety in SPADES. wanna play soccer? sure! Wanna play some CTF? They got you covered! Wanna play some Last Man Standing games, both Player vs Player and Player vs Environment? Boom. Add in World tour, Tourney, and both LAN/servered and local multiplayer and you have a decently solid game.PROS:Dumb FunAmazing graphics and cosmetic designVariety to an insane degreeCONS:No dedicated serversnot much AI progression in tourney mode""Something about it feels lazy:Feels like a mobile port at times.Overall this game gets a 6.3/10 for me. Wait for a sale or it to be free, and for this price point, maybe just get it if your looking for a few hours of fun, but not much more.			"

												It is what it is. A simple yet enjoyable game for young ones and adults. The game mechanic is also simple but really fun, and the controls are easy and responsive. For this price it is a very good buy. If you live a stressfull life like myself, it is a miracle sometimes just relax and play a cute, simple, fun game. Like Adorables.			"

												When there are no sounds (just the goal), there is no way to change the volume of the music just turn it on / off, you have the 3 star rating system, you can disable phone rumbling, there are no tutorials, graphics settings bug out and there is no exit button... You are looking at a lazy mobile port! Again.At least it's cheap, still there are better games (PC games!) for 2.24 bucks. Buy it when it's even cheaper, and fixed. Otherwise not recommended.			"

												After the events of the great World War III, humans and the illuminati set in an conflict that would never end.Both sides tired of all the dead they both had (even after a mass nuclear explosion they experienced), they decided that every conflict would be solved in a game of life and death.The winner, would honor their nation and get all the ♥♥♥♥♥es he wants. The loser, not only would burn to death but would see all of his family getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by the opposite side.And it has been like that forever, on this universe the mutant creatures don't even take the games serious anymore unless it is a really good oponent and some are just in to punch each other with no clothes at all (which led to most of the creatures turning themselves homosexuals)Features:-Fast Paced Intense 4k 60Fps gameplay-Loads of gamemodes like ""Team DeathMatch"", ""Last one standing"" and ""Steal the virginity""-Local play with xbox360scopes support-Hard Achievements for hardcore achievement hunters (pros only)-Loads of quickscopes for you to try-Rekt supportCons:-Too much blood on the screen, kinda takes out the mood-Soundtrack is too intense-No killcamOverall a great game if you're into arena fast paced shooters.

												Adorables:~~~~~~~~   Let me ask you this question ladies and Gents . . . what has a round body shape, cute little round limbs, small mouth and one huge eye? Well. . . come on, what is it? It is the Adorable of course, and they are just waiting for you to come and play with them.Adorable is a casual/strategy/sports/online game for all ages. This game will offer you five modes to test your skills with these adorable creatures across three different sports: Capture the Flag, the Last Adorable Standing, and the Mummy Events. The sporting events are Football (Soccer for my Aussie and American friends), Beach Football and Ice Hockey. In these sports you have to score three goals to win the game. You have to capture your opponent’s flag three times to win in the Capture the Flag game. In the Last Adorable Standing (please use a slightly Austrian accent when reading it), you will be on a platoon and you will have to get rid of the three adorable opponents by sending them off for a swim. In the Mummy Event, all you have to do is to make sure your Adorables are not touched by the Mummy. How do you control your Adorables? Well, it is like a turn base setup. Let’s take the example of the Football. Each turn you will assign each Adorable in which direction they will travel via an arrow attached to them. You can choose how fast your Adorable will travel by stretching the arrow as fast as you can toward the direction. When you are ready to end the turn, all Adorables (yours and your opponent’s Adorables) will launch themselves towards their specific directions and you might think you are playing a game of billiards.  Every time you win a game, you will be awarded with coins which you can use towards customizing your Adorables, from body shape, mouth and eyes to different colours.  The only option missing is the ability to save your progress or just have auto save.The graphics are cute and adorable. Catchy music (cute) and the controls are easy to use and master.  Positives:~~~~~~~  -	Adorable graphics-	6 modes to play including online-	Fun customisation-	Fun and addictive -	Good price point-	Achievements and trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~  -	No Saving options-	Repetitive  Adorables is a fun, addictive and casual game for all ages! 7.5/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

												Cute little time waster that's worth the money. Adorables is a turn-based stragety game in which you launch you little adorables in a direction for a cirtain reason like pushing an opposite team mate in the water or pushing the ball in the goal ect.. I myself recieved this game for free but I'd say it's well worth the money. Its a cute little time killer and actually pretty fun. They update it frequently to make sure there's always enough content to enjoy. I'd say its a well worth game that's good for a little waste of time or a little fun. Keep up the good work developers!			"

												Adorables is a physics-based sports game. It features six dfferent gamemodes: Soccer, Beach Ball, Ice Hockey, Capture the Flag, Last Adorable Standing, and Mummy. You control a team of three ""adorables"" which must complete varying objectives depeding on the gamemode.  In Soccer, Beach Ball, and Hockey, you have to move a ball (or puck) into the enemy team's goal. In Capture the Flag, you must take the enemy's flag and bring it to your own flag. In Last Adorable Standing, the goal is to push the enemy team off of a platform. In Mummy, the goal is to avoid touching an AI and let it kill the enemies.Pros+Bright and colorful+Fun gameplay+Great concept+Trading Cards+Variety of modes to playCons-Sound effects/music are very loud and can be annoying-Glitchy at times-AI dumber than dirt-Some redundant gamemodes (Soccer, beach ball, and hockey are slightly different versions of the same game)-Stalemate-y gamemodes (hockey and CTF)As someone who recieved this game in a giveaway, I'm surprised with the level of quality in this game. At only $3, you'll get your money's worth of fun out of this. Not perfect by any means, but for its pice tag, it's pretty good. "
