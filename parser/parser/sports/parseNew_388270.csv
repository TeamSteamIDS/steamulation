												I have/had Baseball mogul 99 and 05. The 99 was awsome, the 05 version was pretty similar but ok.When i opened the 2015 version, i had to check if i havent started my 2005 one.If you take out the 1, the expansion draft team, (that featured is pretty nice. You can take any expansion team and do the drafting if you want to) and the database for season 2006 to 2015, well its almost the exact same game.Same UI, same good for 99 A.I but way to weak for a 2015 game. Very limited managing options.Basically i paid for an update roster of my 2005 version. Yep feel pretty dumb for it.. Even worst if yourelike me and loving to play oldies team. Meaning that update roster from 06 to 15 really means nothing.If you want an easy to beat and learn baseball sim for cheap this is for you.If you want something more serious do yourself a favor, spend a few more bucks and go getthe last or next to last OOTP. I only have the 2011 of OOTP but its still a much, much better sim than this last Mogul.One day i'll learn to do some research before i jump on a title even at 60% off.. :)			"

												I bought several (non-Steam) versions of Baseball Mogul over the years and have likely spent thousands of hours playing this game over the years.  While it isn't as deep or as realistic as OOTP, it is easy to pick up and play and still offers a deep simulation of MLB starting in any season from 1901 through 2014.  If you want to actually pitch, hit and field, Baseball Mogul isn't for you but if you'd rather run the team and want a game that allows you to do exactly that without having to worry about all the complicated details, Mogul is for you.  In Baseball Mogul, you can play 10 seasons in a single setting, set your lineup on a daily basis or manage your team pitch-by-pitch.  You can even simulate 500 seasons at a time with the Play Multiple Seasons feature.  There's plenty of depth in Baseball Mogul to keep those of us who enjoy the statistical side of the sport playing for years.			"

												Start an expansion team.  Get myself one of the top 5 pitchers in the league, Spend way more focus getting good itching together than anything else. Two years into the franchise and my team is the same as it was year 1.  As long as i dont sit and watch the computer play the game out i have a chance to win.  If i do watch, my top pitcher is guaranteed to give up several runs in the first two innings, 90-95% of the time its a home run, gives up ground balls 68% of the time.  You can set a watch to it its so consistant.  Its a 95% chance that the other team will score multiple runs in the first 3 innings regardless of wh is batting or pitching.  I was really hoping for a game that would reflect the abilities of the players on the team but it does not appear to be the case.  I can have the best team in the league and if i take them over and just watch the game, they will at best end up 500 for the season.  There are a million adventure games out there that i can play if my goal is to end up♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off  and frustrated.  This is another piece of toilet paper that escaped the flush.			"

												This is a pretty sweet game, very complex and offers a ton of hours of play time. If you prefer management type games instead of simulators, this will definitely get you hooked up into baseball.			"

												This is my first baseball sim game, honestly i haven't had much experience with baseball games, but i found this one easy to pick up and play, not too complicated to learn, and i had fun playing it, would recommend to anyone that wants to try out a baseball management simulator that isnt too overly impossible to get into.

												I can see alot of longevity here. What it doesn't do right is miniscule. The system is outrageously intuitive, the sport of baseball explodes out of it in all honesty and complexity that make the sport amazing. The trick with these types of games is in capturing the authentic feel of the sport. BBM is very easy on the eyes and boils everything down into digestible nuggets.Of course nothing beats being at the actual events in real life, the excitement and  realism offers dramatics in so many different ways. In Baseball Mogul you get to see the nuts and bolts of a franchise, introspective never suggestive. The peanuts and crackerjack are what you bring to the table, contemporary as fantasy, imagination. Like listening to a game on the radio but behind the scenes and making the calls down to the science of it all. You are in control, at what level is up to you. Sure other games offer deliberations of options, this game includes any way to play with infinite replayability. Power in simplicicty. The algorithyms used here are freaking realistic and darn deep, such as player friendships and pitchers teaching pitchers different new pitches. Players can be happy in a big city or be more country boy and would play better on other ball clubs. Money and budgets for stuff like TV rights and concessions and more. There is nothing cookie cutter here but if there is and it works than use it to better your own franchise!Presentation = AwesomeThere are no cons, except I haven't found how to warm up pitchers during a game and something else but I forgot because I have been so immersed.Easily moddable game to add player photos or your own team logos. Use your imagination, its all based on the real league. Rosters are so in depth with scouting reports on every single player since 1901. Pitch location and batting sweet spots are all calculated and saved. Player ratings are agreeable and actually fluctuate and mature.Do yourself a favor and get your baseball fix with this program. It is very easy to utilize.**As a side note and simple yet stunning occurence in one of my franchises is this and lets things speak for themselves about the realism - A certain now retired major leaguer who held home run records, career has suprisingly fallen short of its real life counterpart, suspiciously around the time that he started taking steroids. SO sorry kids, this game does not take into account steroid usage in its algorythms.			"

												Awesome Game! If you like baseball. I highly suggest! I use this program for a fantasy baseball league. You can make pitching matchups like Nolan Ryan versus Babe Ruth and more! Awesome game. But I suggest getting the newer version			"

												A fun game, if you are into manager games and like baseball. Although baseball is not my favourite sport, it is a pretty complex manager game. I will try it out some more and come back with a more detailed review, but until now, I find it fun to play.			"

												I was a bit skeptic regarding BBM15, but it turned out to be alright. It's an alright price/value, especially if you buy it on sale. As you can imagine, graphics are not that great, but it gives you a lot of in-game choices and it's a lot of fun playing it; I just wish I'd have more time to dig into it.			"
