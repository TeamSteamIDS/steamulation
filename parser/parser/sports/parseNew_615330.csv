												I was pretty happy about the penguin models and animations used in this game (my primary reason for purchasing). Overall the gameplay is pretty straight forward (bat the penguin as far as possible and guide it along its path), but the game is still rough around the edges. I hope the dev finishes this because the design is nice and it just needs a few tweaks.Good  Good penguin models and animations.  Batting controls feel about right.Neutral  Took up most of my play space (2.4m x 2.4m) to go from bat to penguin diving board.  Noticed some infrequent ASW/ATW/reprojection while using a 1080ti.Bad  Desperately needs some kind of explanation on how to play. (A menu would be nice. There currently isn't one.)  Controls are confusing.  Some details feel rushed. Application icon was the unity symbol in steamVR. Name was ""now_playing_string"". No easy way to exit the program. "

												My overview: 


YouTube™ Video: PENGUINS ARE BASEBALLS IN VIRTUAL REALITY! | Happy Penguin Gameplay (HTC Vive VR)

			I didn't have very high hopes going into this VR game but it's actually not that bad! A little clunky here and there but nothing that a little patching can't solve!		

The game is better than I thought it would be. I thought it would be only batting penguins. But after you bat them you get to guide them in flight via a glider, and when they land on snow via a snowmobile! You get item upgrades that further increases the travel distance of the penguins. I ran into a few hiccups here and there. I felt like the rings were a little too low. I always found myself flying higher than all of the cool stuff down below. It still exceeded my expectations and is good all around fun. Could see this being a great game for kids.			"

												I found myself bored on a rainy Saturday and as I was browsing through the Steam VR store one particular game caught my eye - Happy Penguin VR. The game is similar to Angry Birds in the sense that you have to fling a penguin in the air and then navigate it to hit certain bases and rings. The game is meant for the casual VR gamer as there are no levels in particular and the content is pretty limited.Gameplay 3.5/5Price 5/5Replayability 3/5Full Review: https://thevrbase.com/happy-penguin-vr-review/ "

												First I was disappointed. I expected a realistic penguin hitting simulator, but the game is clearly not realistic at all. The physics are all wrong, and penguins don't wear hats.But while continuously hitting penguins, it hit me: This game was never meant to be realistic. It was meant to be philosophical!What is all of this about?Where do you want to go?Do you want to sacrifice everything for a brief moment of ultimate happiness?I was deeply touched by this game and it made me ponder the deeper meaning of life. Definitely recommended!			"
