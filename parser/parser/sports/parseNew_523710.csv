												As someone who regularly trains with swords in real life, there is a near infinite amount of things I could say about this game. I'll try to get it down into a simple pros / cons list with a bit more detail.PROS:*The cutting and blocking feels absolutely amazing. You can almost feel the weight when you parry or land a proper strike.*The armor system on the enemies makes every fight challenging and unique. You can only attack an enemy where he has no armor, something very rarely seen in games.*The developer seriously listens to good suggestions. Just in the couple of days I've been talking with him about some realistic facets of sword combat, the game has become a LOT more balanced, and hopefully it will continue to improve.*Has a low graphics mode that enables the game to run on really bad PCs. I have a single 660ti and with low graphics on, it runs flawlessly. One of maybe four games that I can currently run at full FPS in VR.*Simple. This may sound like a con, but not in this game. It is a PURE, unclogged swordfighting game. No nonsense. Pick up a blade and fight. There are other games like Raw Data and Spell Fighter that feature sword combat, but this is the only one where that is the entire focus of the whole game, and therefor can be made far greater than any other.*Complex. Yes, I'm just doing this to mess with you now. Just kidding, but this game has so many nuances to succeeding that a seemingly simple game can be made very complicated. The different sized blades sacrifice realism for balance, which while unintuitive, is completely needed to keep things fair. Example: The greatsword has a six-foot reach, deals two damage. Combat knife has only the reach of your arm, deals six damage. And there are blades of every size in between, all with their own stats. Some are far better at thrusting, some at slashing, some have an edge on each side and can be used in powerful combination attacks.*Music sounds a lot like the Japanese Godzilla theme, which is a pro in any situation.Alright, now for the unfortunate and hopefully soon to be fixed CONS:1: Animations are terrible. I'm sorry, there's no other way to say this. Especially in the defensive circle-walk the enemies do, they're holding their swords through their own chests. I would suggest changing the animation for that walk to something like what is seen here: http://i.imgur.com/XTvLMM9.jpg - With the sword held in front of the shield, ready to lash out while still keeping defenses up.2: Complete lack of sword physics VS the enemy. I understand that this may be a matter of opinion, but it is my belief that if I strike an enemy, without enough power to deal damage, the sword should slide along the targets body, weapon, or shield instead of just phasing through them. It would be a lot easier to tell if I'm just hitting too lightly or missing completely if the swords had actual physical rigging as seen in Raw Data or the guns in H3VR.3: Give us an option for an off-hand shield :-DAnd a final suggestion, unlockable skins for weapons. Only once all the big issues are ironed-out, of course. I'd love to see a medieval dagger skin for the combat knife, a Zweihander skin for the greatsword, perhaps a copyright-friendly lightsword skin for the katana? All up to the developer. If only I knew how to create this stuff, I'd make a skin unlockable for every level beaten and give them all to Eric.Anyway, that's the end of my review. With the very few downsides, buying this game is a resounding ""MUST."" It is by far the best melee combat game released for VR at this time, and with continuous improvements and expansions, that title could last a very long time. Master Indie has a monopoly on this right now, and I deeply hope to see him take full advantage of this. "

												The closest I have got to smashing a controller.  Luckily my knuckles took most of the damage.  My play space is on the minimal limit, so I find myself concentrating on ensuring i'm not about to plunge my controller weilding hand into the wall as much as combating the knights themselves.It's a credit to the game that even with that restriction it plays well.It gets tough quick, which I find is a disadvantage with less space.  I pretty well have to stand my ground, parry and jab.  I have also found the scimitar and broadsword are too short for such tactics.I would love to play this game with masses of space, but the minimal space requirement is still well worth the entry fee.  I shall be returnung to this game on a regular basis.Edit:I bust my controller:I unlocked skermish, which was great, but when dealing with multiple enemies I took to the tactic of smacking a knight's shield with my sword so they back away - past my play area.A brief check of Youtube, the purchase of a T5 Torx screwdriver, and half and hour of fiddling the controller's back in action. But......Once bitten, twice shy. I have decided that even with the minimum required space I cannot safely play this game as it is intended. It would be nice to see some refinement of single combat adversaries for us persons with limited space (or the Brits, if you prefer).I still recommend the game though, but be warned if space is minimal.

												As it is right now, it's just WAY to easy to just go in stabbing under the shield to score kills. Currently a deal breaker....that being said, the developer seems VERY open to suggestions and making improvements! I really get the feeling that the necessary improvements will be made and that the game will continue to be expanded upon.For that reason, I will not be ""returning"" the game, as I want to support the developer, because I can see where this could  eventually be a GREAT game.I look forward to updating my review to a ""recommend"" in the near future, hopefully!

												So before I start, I'm going to say that I acknowledge the game was just released. Though, the store page does not mention any ""Early Access"" like I'd hope to believe, I'll keep that in mind.Therefore, let me get down to the principles of the game.Basically, you start out with a single sword, and you progress through levels in which you parttake in combat against AI enemies with armor, shields, and swords. It obviously gets harder as you get through, setting up for a breath of relief as you finish that last level.However fun it appears at first, the further you get in, the more you notice just how terribly horrible the hit detection is--how utterly frustrating it is to try and hit an enemy.Your sword will constantly skip out on hitting a specific part of their body and just hit the armor. Your sword will also give multiple hits at once if you repeatedly stab back and forth with your weapon--even if it's still inside the enemy.Maybe it's just my personal experience from it, but the swordplay in this game is nothing more than hope that you don't register hitting their armor and try not to hit your bedroom walls--even though the enemies linger outside of it at all times.I do not recommend to anyone who's ever been frustrated with bugs in games.

												You can ignore the usual ""Awesome! So cool. I'm exhausted!"" reviews from the Kool-Aid gulping wide eyed, fan boy types. They would have fun dancing around their bedrooms waving a toilet brush with a bucket on their heads shouting ""Take that foul demon!""I gave this game the benefit of the doubt, watching the dev videos for a few months and reserving my opinion until trying it. Unfortunatley it plays just like it looks and it looks a little disjointed. I get the feeling these are store bought art assets. This results in a jarring mix in the quality of models, textures and animations so it feels more like a tech demo rather than a finished product.Regarding gameplay the enemy characters hover just outside the bounds of the chaperone which means of you are going to be swinging your controller full speed (as it requires you to do) at them.  The potential for controller smashing and loved one assaulting is terrifyingly high. Games like ""Thrill of the fight"" handle this style of close quarters combat much better.A Vive labour of love that suffers from the problems of developing with limited outside input.Maybe following the ""QuiVr"" dev model of community testing through development would have helped iron out the gameplay kinks. It is however well priced and robustly coded, the art and more importantly gameplay on offer, are not to my taste.			"

												Sword Master VR is just another name for sweating all over the place Simulator. I have played this straight for 2 hours with my brother in taking turns and we already reached lvl 9 plus 5 expert medals. The gameplay is getting extremly challenging but also satisfying as you progress. Dont loose hope when fighting 4 opponents at the same time. You´ll get used to it. Balancewise i´d say the Rapier is way too strong compared to the slashing weapons. Thrusts are pretty effective but hard to land. Strike, guard, dodge all while keeping possible other knights in check. Breaking guards to get a moment of time so you can thrust forwards is a great way of taking down the bigger guys. If you are used to Swordfighting or have a hunch on how diffrent Swords should be used, you´ll find yourself in a big advantage. Neverless the game is still very challenging. Pros: - Music. The Soundtracks fully add to the envoirement and combat- Diffrent types of Swords gets you a lot of diffrent approaches on how to defeat single or multiple enemys. Reach over damage? Thrusts or Slashes? Short range versus long range? Why not try dual wielding to mix it up a bit?- Expert levels aswell as a Survival mode makes it interesting in long term- Pretty accurate hit boxes. Sometimes it feels like it could use some work but most of the times its working splendid- Intimidating models of the knights add just fine to the setting of an Arena battleCons: - Animations really could use some work- At higher levels it feels like the knights are trying to overcome one with numbers instead of technique. Its more a sort of defending against mashing instead of getting the upper hand by experience. Let them knights attack a bit faster maybe?- No replay button. Once you died thou shalt click thyself through the menu to start a match anew- I want more. More maps, more weapons, diffrent enemys, coop!The game is dirt cheap for what it is. Take the warning and get pets, kids or whatnot out of your room. And if you are any sort of interested in melee fights. Get this game. You wont be dissapointed.			"

												LOVE THIS GAME!!! Before my Achilles gave out I used to love fencing, so I'm always excited to try another sword combat game in VR. While no game can compare to actual fencing, this one really feels like sword fighting. Yes, the AI is simple, but having multiple opponents circling you adds enough difficulty to make up for that once you get to expert level. Also, on expert level this is the best game for exercise I've yet played. Holoball and Holopoint are right up there too, but this one beats them for getting my heart rate going. I'll compare this to my second favorite sword combat VR game, Vanishing Realms (With the new update that gives you Warriors Challenge Hard Mode). The sword combat in Vanishing realms is pattern based, like the original (I'm dating myself here) Prince of Persia, or Prince of Persia Classic on the Xbox 360. I really enjoy it, but your opponents just stand there for the most part. If the opponents moved around you more, like they do in Sword Master, then I would have to consider that my favorite sword game because the patterns are more complex and some of the attacks are faster.To the developer: I would like a mode where the opponents don't forecast their attacks so much, and that attack is faster. This might up the challenge without having to have 3 guys surrounding you.Also, I would love to see a duelist mode that was more like fencing. To avoid the challenge of making a sword game work in a situation where you cannot apply force to the player’s hand when their sword is supposed to be deflected you could use a right-of-way convention like what is used in foil and saber fencing. The first one to begin an attack gains the right-of-way and, if they land the hit, will score if the opponent dose not parry. Parrying gives the opponent the right of way. The player having lost the right-of-way can no longer score even if they land the hit unless they first regain the right-of-way. Missing with an attack also causes you to lose the right-of-way. So, if your attack falls short your opponent can immediately attack and will score even if you strike again and you both hit at the same time. Not sure how do-able it would be to program this but I would love to see something like this in a sword game.			"

Alot of the hits you'll get will magically be blocked evn if you clearly hit the guy. This would be better if it was more one on one with smarter AI as you progressed. Not just adding a bunch more of the same thing each wave			"

												I've been waiting for this for a while. This is a very fun, but also quite challenging experience. Be prepared to sweat and inch your way through the numorus stages, but don't let the difficulty discourage you. Finishing a stage feels fantastic and with each enemy beaten, you'll feel that much better as a VR Swordsman. The sword fighting mechanics are pretty solid, but certainly not 1:1 with real life. They're very close however. The animations give you a good window of prediction and the reactionary animations of the enemies are pretty realistic and don't feel canned.It's also worth adding that I have a smaller than average playspace and while I can get away with playing this, it can be difficult at times. If you have a small playspace, make sure to stand where you can swing with your arm extended all around you without hitting anything. If you can do that, you should be alright as long as you don't walk much. Just be careful because you can really get lost in this experience.			"

												I usually won't post a review without a lot more time in game. However, I hate seeing a game's reputation dragged down by negative reviews from players who played less than half an hour. Honestly, the game does have some hit box issues and weapon balance needs to be addressed. The dev has said as much, and stated he's working on it. With that out of the way, the game is more than worth its price tag. Nothing in VR has gotten my heart racing like trying to hold off three dual wielding opponents with a rapier. As others have stated, you will be sweating and out of breath in minutes, but keep coming back for one more round.			"

												Wow, this game is grueling in the best possible way, especially when you have four Ring Wraith looking mofos surrounding you. There is a lot of movement – furious movement – inherent to this game. Imagine bobbing, weaving, attacking, parrying, riposting, spinning and lunging all in the space of 20 seconds and you will have some idea of how physically intense this game really is. On top of that, throw in dual wielding swords, and you can double your pace. I felt this game working not only the muscular endurance of my arms and shoulders, but quite a lot of the back muscles as well, specifically the lats, traps, and scapula. Expect to feel this game in your core muscle group as well. If you want a real challenge, try out the Survival mode. I took out 32 baddies until I finally succumbed to total exhaustion and got stabbed in the face. I’ve since been settling for working my way through Novice level 6-10 to get a good 20-minute workout that doesn’t leave me uncontrollably weeping. Just restrained weeping.			"

												the game has pretty good graphics,and it seems the developer has invested decent amount of time to make the game as good as possible.The game suffers(more then any other vr game i played) from the fact we do not yet have wireless hmds. The AI of the opponent is a bit wierd,he woud simply walk in to me with his shield and that would break the VR immersion.I could hit his shield with the sword but in the real life that would seem pointless to me. It would have made much more approachable VR game if instead of fighting shielded opponent,who is most of the time behind his shield(not even able to se you and who throws hits once every 10-15 sec),you were fighting 1 sworded opponent,who would be constantly attacking you with combos,while playing safe,reacting to the player's moves and keeping distance himself.

												I can't praise this game enough (tldr from 0 - the dev owes me money to 10 - transformative experience I'd put this at 8.5)  so I'll start with negatives:Hit detection can be fiddly until you puzzle out the system/adapt to it.On higher levels enemies don't get harder so much as numerousIt's best enjoyed in a larger play space (I found I kept lunging into walls in a 2x2m area)If you're someone who can't resist cheesing, lying down on the floor and jabbing the legs is a guarranteed if slow way to victoryOnto praises:Enemies are huge and intimidating, the red screen -> hit again -> death mechanic works really well for keeping the pressure on you while forgiving small mistakes, you can parry, shield block, shield bash or just plain stab them in the throat before they hit you.The game rewards finess over random flailing. It's extremely rewarding to see youself skill up to the point where enemies that used to stress you out can be dispatched with a few casual flicks and a lunge. Unlocking new swords and playing with them gives the game high replay value, especially once you get duel weilding and can mess with lots of combos (10/10 would bring knives to a sword fight again).There are a lot of different ways to crack the enemy, from massive chops with a heavy sword till they stagger to quick oppertunistic jabs with a rapier. I found myself lunging, ducking and doing whatever the neo backwards lean is called. Getting surrounded by 3 enemies while cowering behind a shield is an experience you just have to try.As a bonus this game is quite enjoyable to spectate/take turns with, the 3rd person camera view for mirrored screen allows spectators to call out warnings (say for an enemy behind you) while still fitting with the overall theme of the game/not breaking the fourth wall too hard.I'm currently sore all over from playing this and honestly haven't had this much fun since I was a kid, it's not quite as polished as say vanishing realms or space pirate trainer but in my opinion is a lot more enjoyable that SPT. If you're looking for nonstop, sweat pouring off you action that rewards real player skill check this game out.Would shout ""are you not entertained"" again.			"

												Was fun at first, right up until I realized all I had to do was hold my sword in their gut under the shield until they died.Honestly I've been dying for a game like this for the Vive but this one just doesn't feel complete. Here are a couple of things I would recomend:1) enemies need to move their shield to block your attacks a bit more. (right now they just let you stab underneath until they die)2) the hit boxes for the lower torso and legs needs to be adjusted. (seems like half of the time my sword just goes through the character model)I wouldn't ask for a refund but I do hope to see the game get tweaked a bit before I would play again.			"

Only thinking about when I can play again, and that I'll definitely do some warmup first.This is true VR sports. And so much fun.Up until now Space Pirate Trainer, Holopoint, and Thrill of the Fight were my go-to VR sports games. But since I prefer swordplay and am especially motivated by the unlockable swords and fighting styles, this has become my favorite game of them all.Excellent game and I really hope the developer will continue working on it and keep adding more maps, enemies, weapons and fighting styles. I'd happily pay for some DLC since the base is already excellent and could get even better with some more content.It's definitely a gem, my favorite VR sports game and among the best you can get for VR. Highly recommended.			"

												Extremely underrated. This is easily the most intense and exciting VR experience i have had so far. You really feel like you have become Link from Zelda and  yo uwil lcatch yourself doing heroic poses, shield bashing, ducking slashes and performing every over the top sword fighting technique you remember from much loved game characters. And they all work! It takes a game like this to focus on such a simple premise, sword based combat in a small arena, to make something perfect and truelly brilliant. Because of the way that the arena space is always visible, the way the AI moves within it and the lack of a need to move past those bounds limit the times you will accidentally clip a wall. Theres no other game where you will be moving this quickly and violently while knowing that its extremely unlikely you will hit a wall. No teleporting, no motion sickness, just you, moving around your room holding your sword, with a guy in there with you that wants you dead. Amazing, amazing game.			"

												You know what?  No.  I’m sick of thisThe HTC Vive came out in April of last year.  Development kits came out before then to give important community members/developers an idea of whats possible with the technology.  This game came out in early access 5 months after the official HTC Vive release.We should not be seeing this kind of trashy tech demo’s at a price of $10 anymore.  The unity personal splash screen is here, it looks to be using store assets(bad ones at that, I feel like I’m in VR Quake 2 style graphics here.), and is even more basic than Wii Sports Resorts sword fighting on the Nintendo Wii, which came out back in 2009.  Ill admit that isn’t a fair comparison due to the devs involved, but Im saying I wouldn’t spend $10 on that either, let alone this.  This should have been free.  I am noticing a lot of shovelware/paid tech demo releases in VR; you know what it reminds me of?  The video game crash of 1983.  Just a truck load of games of varying(mostly crap) quality with no assurance that your getting what you paid for.  If this keeps up, VR is gonna pass away as a fad.As far as the game itself, I’ve already mentioned poor looking graphics.  The assets are used repeatedly throughout the game.  I could probably count the number of available models on my fingers(excluding the individual player sword/shields, which have been added over time and do nothing really).  The sword fighting is very simplistic, involving wagging your blade in the general undefended spots of your enemy and hovering your blade in front of an attack, no matter how impossible it would be to actually defend with your chosen stance.   Blades seem to act instantaneous, polarized magnets when clashing.  They fly far off with no respect to strength of a swing.  That might be acceptable if you are looking for an arcade style experience, but it gets worse.  The animations of your opponents will change drastically to try and mix you up when you try and defend.  They can go from preparing a tall vertical slice to an awkward spin attack in an instant.  It would almost be comical if it wasn’t obvious this was meant to make them more difficult because the dev couldn’t make an intelligent AI.  It doesn’t feel impressive to fight these strange moving grunts, and that’s unacceptable whether you are going for realistic or arcade style gameplay.This is the third game I have requested a refund on steam for; the 2nd one was also a VR cash grab.  PS: Don’t act like I’m not supporting VR by refunding this/not buying trash VR games.  I already bought the hardware.  A decent developer isn’t going to judge the success of his game on how these unity cash grabs are doing.  They might raise an eyebrow if that’s all that shows up here though.			"

												Tons of fun. This game reminds me a lot of boffer fighting. Highly recommended! Be aware that the needs a decent amount of totally clear space. I have a 3mx2.5m room and I'm hit or backed up into a wall multiple times and I've not yet finished novice.			"

												I've tried a decent amount of the more popular titles for VR and some not so, but this is the perfect VR experience. The game reads your movements like a book, looks top notch, the sound is great, and the fighting is as smooth or as choatic as you want it to be, and the AI will respond accordingly it feels like. For the price tag it would be foolish not to get this.			"

												Not a bad game at all. The controls are simple and work well, wouldn't mind having a shield in the beginning or dual wield. Hit detection works relatively well although it gets a bit choppy when the characters crowd you. A few swings at their shield or sword will force them to backstep though. This will give you a really good workout swinging your arms around and stepping around in your box.			"

												This is such a workout! I think the only other VR game on par with this level of exercise is probably Holopoint. Highly recommended if you are looking to break a sweat while have fun doing it.Cons:1. Since you are required to swing weapons at high speed, if your playing area is very small, or if it's surrounded by hard walls or fragile items, you will want to be extra careful. Consider turning on one of the more invasive chaperone.2. The enemies' animation quality is not very good. More realistic and varied animations would add to the immersion.Pros:1. Although the weapon selection is not huge, the characteristics of different weapons promote very different strategies and playstyles.2. At higher difficulties, precision becomes essential to success - the speed and angle of the strikes are essential. Real swordfighting tips such as avoiding overswings also surprisingly become relevant.3. As mentioned early, really breaks quite a sweat, and time passes fast while doing it.			"

												I really wanted this game to be good, with people calling it a ""VR Dark Souls."" I guess they said that because it has swords and skeletons in it...One of the things I LOVE about the prospect of swordplay in VR is that, as someone that practices HEMA (Historical European Martial Arts) myself, I'm experienced in the mechanics of swordplay. Knowing how to defend, proper stances and attack routines, knowing how to simultaneously defend and attack in a single motion.This game pretends to take these concepts into account, but does so very poorly. The enemies leave themselves wide open, yet even a clean cut to the undefended abdomen usually passes right through the enemy's body, or they'll somehow parry attacks that came nowhere near their shield or sword. Meanwhile, enemies will routinely step outside of the play area and wait for you to attack, which becomes more of an issue when there are two of them. It makes it feel as if the developers didn't anticipate people playing this game inside of a house.A good idea, but very, very poorly executed. Poor hit detection, annoying AI, and sub-par performance all plague this game. Even at $10, it's too expensive, because there are a lot of VR titles out there at that price that are far superior.

												Played on Oculus / TouchTechnically the game worked well with the touch. No issues at all.I couldn't get into the game at all unfortunately. The lack of feedback which is just in the nature of touch controllers and the overall ""cheapish"" look of the game didn't do it for me. It might be a cool demo occasionally but i got bored very quick. It has not alot to do with actual sword fighting and i guess it's a cool agility game but there's almost no content here.One thing that's worth mentioning is that the videos depict it like it matters wether you swing your sword in a ""realistic"" slow speed, i didn't see that at all in the game, you can be jerky and quick like blade runner it doesnt matter.

												It's easy to underestimate this game, until you play it.It really does make you move (parry, swing, jump back) in order to beat 2 bad guys at a time.The sword/shield dynamic has not been really fun in the other games I've played. This one is all about that dynamic, and they have done it well. Fighting one enemy at a time is not that hard, but when they add more than one, it becomes hard to attack and block. Get ready to sweat and have fun doing it!			"

Product received for free
												I was given this game for free by the developer even though I had full intentions on purchasing it and playing it myself. This game is intense. I found myself swinging on the floor for dear life trying not to die! The sword combat is fantastic and the unlockable weapons kept me coming back for more. You really have to be precise with your attacks and block with your sword at the right moment to defend. The physics are pretty good for a VR Sword-Combat game and I can't wait to see what else is done with the game!Check out the Let's Play I did and see for yourself how intense this game can be!

												Overall the game could be fun but there are a lot of things holding it back at the moment.con.:- unbalanced (the knife pretty much one/two shots everything on every difficulty)- hit detection is not that great considering that enemies, especially the dual-wielding ones, barely touch you and you take multiple hits - AI is also not that great, since they close in way to much and pretty much give you free hits behind their shieldspro.: - the idea is pretty neat and there are not many good meele combat oriented games out there as of yet  So yeah I refunded it after I beat pretty much 80% of the game without any effort or that much fun except the moments where you just wreck your enemies with your tiny tiny knife.I can't recomend to buy this product AS OF YET because despite it being maybe a promising title it has way too many flaws in my opinion.

												I have only played this game so far on Novice difficulty level. On novice, I feel this is a physically intense game and can be punishing for me because I am the type to tunnelvision under stress. At times I would have to focus on defending myself from all attacks and tunnelvisioning on trying to maneuver into a better position to keep my 3 opponents within my field of vision. I can't remember now if there have ever been more than 3 in the arena at once, but I do appreciate the ability to shift the odds a little more in my favor by giving me a more tactical view of the arena, this way.The first 4 or 5 stages of novice are kinda easypeasy whatever, but keep pushing. Once I encountred my first dual wielding opponent, and consequently became capable of ambidextrously waving around two of my varied collection of swords and a machete?, each with their own set of stats to consider for dealing damage in a way that works with my playstyle, I knew I would be putting this VR game onto my favorites list. Thanks to the devs for putting this together!			"

												I didn't get this game at first- it seemed very easy and slow.  I also didn't understand why I didn't have a shield, nor why I would need one given the pacing of everything.  Expert mode makes it all click, and and least for me, made me feel like everything else was just preperation.  The frantic action in expert mode is super fun and a great workout. Make sure you have the room space to thrust and swing- scuffed my hands a few times while lost in the moment!			"

												If you’re looking for a VR sword fighting arena game, then Sword Master is definitely worth the asking price of $9.99. That’s not to say it’s without problems though, so make sure you know what you’re in for before you commit the cash. I hope this video will help in your purchasing decision:

												One phrase to sum it up... JANKY WII GAME! Not sure I have ever refunded a steam game and i'm refunding this... Very disappointed at how incomplete this feels and how I feel totally misled by the trailers. There are number of things wrong with this and i'l try and cover them here. Ultimately it feels like a Wii sword game where you just flail at the right time to win.1. OMG the hitboxes. These are completely messed up and ultimately what makes the game feel like a Wii sword game.... The shield has a hitbox the size of his mom. It doesn't matter how far you reach around you will most likely hear the clank of the shield even though you are no where near it. I'm not sure why they even have feet because 1 out of 4 times will it actually even register your hit (same with his back and really most all of him). 2. Not accuracy but timing. It's not about how accurate you are but WHEN you swing. If you don't wait for his shield to go down then why swing at all. You can try and be agile and swing under it but while your sword will perfecly cleve through his body you will either hear the clang of the shield or nothing will register. This is infuriating as you will feel you are robbed time and time again!!! I'd say it registered a hit 25% of the time when I carefully planned and swung and saw my sword cleave a major body part in two.... no damage (oh and by the way now you are vulnerable and his sword has touched you accidently and hurt you since he clipped into your body)3. Save your time and money and go get GORN for free.			"

												In short, it's really unpolished. The enemies are cartoonishly large, and get up in your face to make up for how incredibly tiny the player sword is, which makes it impossible to see anything or prepare for an enemy attack. This renders the game basically unplayable.To expand on that, the enemies are ""cartoonishly large"" because they're probably orcs or whatever the dev wants to call them. They do get up in your face, and the bigger ones with huge tower shields will put those right in your face to completely obstruct your view. I do believe it's because if they stood much further away, you could not reach them with the tiny sword you're given. While the swords you're given are realistically sized, it leaves you at a disadvantage when the enemy is armed up with 4+ foot long blades and shields as big as they are. Just lengthening the sword and keeping the AI at a slight distance would fix the entire problem and get me to cancel my refund. Another good addition would be movement of any kind. It's upsetting to be stuck in one place constantly, especially since this leads to me moving in the real world and smacking into every wall in my room. Movement would fix that for players like me whom don't get motion sick often. Until further notice, I cannot recommend this game to anyone questioning it. (For the record, I have about 2.6m x 2.2m of space.)			"

												Great game UNTIL...you get to Expert Level 9. The game is a really enjoyable play with satisfying blocks, parrys, slicing and stabbing. The enemies seem to react naturally and keep their distance until ready to strike. Makes sense. TL:DRAt Expert Level 9, the game seems to abandon every law of physics, nature, and invades my personal space. If the developer were to fix only one thing, please prevent anything in the game from occupying the same space. How can I defend agains an attack when the enemy is litterally occupying the same space I am standing in.The Longer review:Novice levels are quite fun and although the shield blocking by the enemy seems realistic, blocking their incoming sword attacks needs help. I know this is difficult since when I swing my sword it doesn't bounce off, but I think this is where games need to suck it up and let the player win. If I swing my sword the NPC's sword has to deflect. We'll never have a battle a clashing swords stuck togther and players battling to win via brute force. Just get over it. Any contact by a player's sword the the NPC needs to react. I think this may also help the 9th level issue.Each win in Novice mode grants a new sword. Great selection, althought I dont think the attributes reflect the sword types, except for the knife.Expert mode was actually easier than Novice. In erpert modes you start winning shields and once you have a shield the battle becomes less hectic. Crouch a little and you're good. I found that once I had a shield, the knife became a lot more usefull and all I have to do in block/parry and then a quick knife to the armpit or ribcage does the trick. Just like real life! Right!However all this falls apart when the enemies bum rush you and ignore the fact that they just got stabbed in their ""no-no"" place. I think they were even ignoring my shield. It ai run into someone with my shield I expected them to at least take a step back if not get knocked over. They guys qual wielding also frequently ingore the fact that I slammed there front sword out of the way. I've actualy walked into them the their sword punctured my shield. I wasn't hurt, but the sword was still there. Kind of weird...So to sum it up:Really fun, but at the more difficult levels, the game breaks down.My personal suggestions:1. Prevent objects and characters from occupying the same space.2. Make the interactions of objects more real.3. If an NPC gets hit, he should react accordingly.4. I'd rebalance the weapons. How does the largest weapon not do the most critical damage?, maybe the chance to crit is lower, but critical damage should be high. It should also have the strength to knock away shields. 5. Explain if the critical/stabbing/slashing bones stack on top of the base damage.6. Don't make the player back out to the main menu everytime.7. The entire play area should be accesible. Why do enemies get a safe area to back into!?! I HIT MY WALLS SO MUCH DURING THIS GAME!!! "

Hopefully i'll have a bigger space soon!-The difficulty level is definitely there.. It's a lot harder than i initially thought. There are tricks but you'll have to figure them out for yourself.-That end-boss is intimidating.con:-The animations really need some work. when you kill an opponent he goes into the most insane positions and stays like that, like trying to do yoga whilst dying or something. funny but a bit unrealistic.-Sometimes they hold their sword through their own body. didn't notice that at first but yeah, i feel like that should not happen.-You can slowly put your sword inside their body but not hit them, makes sense but the fact that your sword in in his chest and has no effect is weird.-When you finish a few levels on novice you can play them all instantly on expert mode aswell. I feel like when switching modes you should have to start from level one again.. but that is personal preference i guess.-When staying low it is quite easy to evade most attacks exept for a few. It would be nice if they could detect when you are staying low and adjust their tactics.-Enemy's tend to only have a few different attacks. Sometimes a new surprice attack would spice things up!Don't get discouraged by these cons. It's basicly nitpicking and details! The amount of fun you have is well worth the price. Get this game.			"

I feel like when switching modes you should have to start from level one again.. but that is personal preference i guess.-When staying low it is quite easy to evade most attacks exept for a few. It would be nice if they could detect when you are staying low and adjust their tactics.-Enemy's tend to only have a few different attacks. Sometimes a new surprice attack would spice things up!Don't get discouraged by these cons. It's basicly nitpicking and details! The amount of fun you have is well worth the price. Get this game.			"

												Amazing game. I love the vatiety of swords it gives you, and the different tactical options they allow for. Every sword is played a little different, with different reach, stab damage, slash damage, etc. This game also forces you to think about not only when to strike, but where, and if your sword is oriented correctly. If you attack with the dull side of your blade, then it's not gonna hurt.			"

												To start of with, Yes  i do recomend this game, but please note some of the cons of this game below When i first started playing this game i was simply amazed how fun it was to practice actual sword techniques against enemys, it was extremely refreshing.However after about 50 or 40 minutes into playing this game i started to notice some glaring issues with this game, although not enough to make me not enjoy it but something that needs to be looked at.-Hit detection, i say this because i tend to use a single weapon and to hit the enemy you need to bash the shield away from them and go in quick with a slash to the abdomen, however when i do this the game does not register this and insteads says either i missed all together or the sheild registers no hit at all and doesnt move. And before people say to me ""you need to articulate your swings better"" I actually broke one of my controlers while doing this due to the size of the space im playing in, so thats a thing. -Difficulty,  Although on the expert modes it can be quite challenging, but lets not mistake difficulty with enemy spam.I say this because on expert i was faced with a rather difficult enemy, although easy enough to fight them on their own, when 3 of them are spawned it becomes a ♥♥♥♥fest of attacks and half of the attacks which they send at me shouldnt hit (which they do anyway so wtf?) -Play Area, Although it does quite obviously state in the games description that you require a specific space to play this game, there is almost no reason for it because you can quite easily just stay where you are and fight them there. This game is a good game, although these issues take away hugely from the success and the fun from this game  "

												Contrary to many others, my opinion of this game is that it works suprisingly well. I was worried about not feeling the weight of the sword but after a short while it didn't really matter to me. It is fun. Having said that, you do need to watch your playspace as you will likely put a controller into a wall.Clearly, there is still some work to be done. The character models are a little bit ropey, but this actually makes them quite menacing. The AI feels a bit odd at times with them just walking at you, and you can just slide to the side and stick your sword in under their shield.We are still in early days of how VR controls are best handled, and this means that there is still a ton of experimenting to be done. Games like this (warts en all) will shape the way games are done in the future. So this makes me excited for what is to come.For 7 quid I'd recommend giving this a go!

												Best sword fighting game on VR without a doubt. There was certainly enough variation in enimies to keep me on my toes, there seemed to be a number of different ways of tackling the issue of 'Oh God, please don't kill me'. I found myself mostly fencing with the enimies, but as the game went on I found different ways of stabbing their squishy bits. Knocking shields and swords away seemed very natural, I would definately recomend getting this game.			"

												Quite an intense sword fighting experince.  While in game the menus and enviroment may seem a bit lacking, the experince you get when actual in the vr game, is quite different.  I found my heart pounding and my body sweating after playing this game.  It is fun, dangerously entertaining and has a variety of unlockable weapons. Only complaint about the game from the amount I played so far is that I'm stuck using 1 handed swords with my off hand completely open compared to your opponets who have giant shields to protect them.  As of now I am unsure if shields or duel wielding are unlockable abilities but if they are....I kind of wish they were available ealier on to cater to people's different play styles, and if not....why isn't this in the game.Though I have some complaints this is definetely not a reason to not purchase and experience this game.  I'm just being greedy and want a slice of cake and ask for more toppings.  Grab it and play it already.			"

												The game, while imperfect, is a lot of fun, and certainly worth the price point at which it's offered.  For its strengths, it really forces situational awareness, fast moving and fast thinking. It's also quite the workout. If you have the free play space available, getting wrist weights can really add to the burn and provide the heft of some of the smaller blades.  Having different positives and negatives for different types of blades is also a very nice touch. You really do notice a difference between them.For the negatives, any force-contact games are going to suffer the physics limitations where reality doesn't translate well into the digital world. It's not uncommon to be able to exploit that by thrusting or slashing with the controller behind the opponent's shield. To be fair, that's some hard physics to try and work out. Also, blade movement and animations of the opponents are a little off.  Sometimes their blades are passing through their own chests, and sometimes they seem to count a hit against you in situations where the blade is in a guard position but the enemy animation is simply rotating in place, causing what would be a feather light touch to count as a hit.All told, I'm definitely pleased with it.  I hope a multiplayer variant where you can duel your friends happens!			"

Normally I do OK, but I guess you should expect to need a lot of room for any game involving VR mele combat ;)The camera angles on the monitor output are AWESOME.  It gives your friends the chance to see you as you see the combat.The AI seems good, but I'd like a litte more polished animation and graphics of the fighters.

												Overall it is a pretty good game. Its difficulty increases each level, and you will find yourself sweating alot. If you want a standard hack and slash, then this game is not for you. You can flail your blades all you want, the opponents have alot of armor and very few weak points. This game tends to favor strategic and swift strikes. All in all it met my expectations. You will need a good amount of space to play in. I hope the developer will add more to it, I am curious to see how far it can go.			"

												I cant recommend this in its current state, although I wont refund it, I got it on sale and I think the price I paid is fair for the content, and I'll hold onto it in the hopes that it evolves to be better. As it is, if you want some nice sword fighting action, I recommend spell master vr, it has better sword play.Pros: Its a sword fighting game in VR, vive room experience works pretty well (although not perfectly). It starts out easy but gets successively harder. The dev keeps on updating it, so there is hope it will become as good as it intends on being.Cons: Its not realistic at all (which is what the game purports to be), so this is my major disappointment. The actual fighting can be won by spamming the enemies with repeated stabs. The physics is non-existant (its all animation based, swords pass through each other etc). Everything feels weightless and floaty. I reacll thw sword play in thief 1 (from a million years ago) is much better. The arena doesnt shape itself to your playing space (missed opportunity). Its not fun. :(			"

												Now if only this game had cutting physics.. Better collision, and less stupid scenarios where you have 3 people surrounding you (This would be fine if it was Full-Dive VR, but due to how clunky our current VR Is, it's basically a fight against your cable and your surroundings to even turn around rather then those 3 guys you're trying to perfect strike but fail to understand how to properly land one) this game would be perfect, oh and a bigger map. If you can even call this a ""map"".If you used this fighting and implemented it into a decent stat point traditional RPG, it'd be perfect.Also different opponents with different fighting styles would be nice. Wouldn't it be nice to fight a cat warrior who keeps jumping around and stuff in really flashy ways, or a huuuuge muscly tank guy.A skilled Swordsman.A puny woman with a dagger..Etc.. Not just a bunch of masked big dudes that don't even get cut and just die out of bleeding after hitting them enough times.			"

												I got this game during the Winter Sale and at that price point, it's worth it. Definitely not worth ""full"" price, even though it's admittedly already quite cheap. This is more like an advanced tech demo than anything else. I think it's good for the ""gee whiz"" factor and for introducing people into what can be possible with VR. The gameplay is simple and easy with blocking and poking working mostly as you would expect. Sword swings don't seem to have much weight and swinging faster/harder doesn't seem to cause more damage. The art assets are okay, but nothing to write home about.The game is fun for what it is, just don't expect too much from it. This is meant for killing 10-15 minutes when you don't have time for a longer VR session but still want to play something.			"

Probably the most polished sword-fighting game with a particularly good difficulty progression in the evels, and the price is very good too!  Also excellent for a workout. See my play-through here:

												One of my favorite VR games! Fun, yes, but such great exercise! It's rare that I play and do not end up covered in sweat. I do have a problem tangling the cord and yanking out the cables from time to time, and I'm trying to learn how to keep in mind I'm really not in a medieval arena with huge knights and double sword wielding ninjas trying to slice me up! Novice levels are pretty easy, but when you get to 3 on 1, you really have to operate at a high level of intensity to stay alive and conquer. This is the only game I have ever played that has inspired me to raise both hands in the air (holding swords masked as controllers) and scream, ""YEAH! YEAH! YEAH!"" at the top of my lungs. My neighbors think I'm insane lol			"

												Only picked this up today and haven't played much yet. Based on first impressions, the graphics are a bit shoddy, with lumpy looking opponents and skeletons standing around the side clapping, apropos of nothing. Enemy movements are wooden and fairly predictable, and the hit detection is iffy. To be completely fair, slightly iffy hit detection in sword combat is not a problem unique to this game.But despite that, for the price I still think it's not a bad proposition if you just want to bash something with a sword for a bit. Whilst something like Vanishing Realms is overall a much more polished game, if you just want something you can fire up for a few minutes here and there and smack some lumpy looking knights around, for a few quid this is perfectly fine.
