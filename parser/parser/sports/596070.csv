Early Access Review
								Update:Leaps and bounds better than the previous version, but still has a ways to go. Physics aren't there yet. AI is non-existent (but that's to be expected at this stage). Puck control isn't a thing. Goalies are somewhat animated pylons. That said, what you DO get now is an enjoyable experience. It's not like playing hockey, yet, but it's fun. You can skate around and hit people, which is hilarious. Not hockey like hitting, just slashing people who immediately go ragdoll. I'm not the type to become nauseated, so I don't mind the simple locomotion. In short, I'm still excited to see this develop.Original Review: Nothing here worth paying for, yet. Controls are beyond cumbersome, physics don't make sense, animations are tacky and entirely unrealistic, and the UI is unintuitive. There's a brilliant idea here (one that I've been waiting ages for, in fact) but the execution just isn't there yet. It was only $1.99, and it's obvious that the developer purchased some assets to make this... so I don't plan on asking for a refund here. Dude deserves to make his money back, and hopefully this will become something more. Advice for the future: Build your gameplay first, then buy your assets to suit. This seems like a case of cart-before-the-horse. Not that nothing good can or will come from this game. Just noting that, in it's current state, it's not playable. Best of luck, man. I really wanna see this turn into something amazing!			"

								There's no game I want more on VR than a proper hockey simulator. And by that, I really mean a hockey goalie simulator. And while ""Goalie Challenge VR"" is a lot of fun, it doesn't scratch that urge of being a part of a full game of hockey. I want to watch plays develop, stop breakaways, and be an integral part of a full game from start to finish. The latest update for this game attempts to do that, but it does so poorly.You can tell exactly what this game is just by watching the video on the store page. The physics are wonky, the sounds are monotonous, and the gameplay is just silly. Being a player is nauseating, unrewarding, and it's impossible to see where the puck is and where it is going as a goalie. I understand that with the limitations of the current technology (i.e. no leg/body tracking) it's challenging to make anything close to a realistic sports game, but this is not the solution.That said, I do appreciate what the developer is trying to do. It's unfortunate that this is the only full hockey game VR experience, but someone had to start somewhere. I think that the developer is being too ambitious with his limited resources. If he starts from scratch and focuses on just one aspect of hockey (like Goalie Challenge VR), I believe he can create a more complete and fun experience. In its current state, I cannot recommend ""Skills Hockey VR."" I hope that he will continue developing this game, and I look forward to seeing a better product in the future.			"

								Long long way to go before its worth buying, even if it is only Â£1.59. Pretty much unplayable in its current state.			"

								$2 bucks is not worth this title. The puck is the size of a dinner plate and grabbing a stick should not be centred but at the handle. This is nit picking. There is nothing fun about this game. The menu is frusterating. Teleporting works randomly for some reason there is no pointer from the controller and the menu system is near the ceiling. It took me 5 minutes to figure out anything. Once I got in and played goalie all I could do was laugh at the little hobbit of a player shooting pucks. If you want to try a good hockey VR experience try VR Goalie. It's free and actualy feels like a hockey game. Pretty obvious who ever made this has never played hockey. One nice thing this game does that VR goalie doent is snap your goalie stick to the surface.			"
