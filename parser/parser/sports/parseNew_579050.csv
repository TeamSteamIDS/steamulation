												I was sceptical at first, but it's free so I tried it anyways. I'm very surprised with how immersive this was. It's experiences like this that reassure me that VR is the future. It literally brought a smile to my face.			"

												This VR experience has tremendous reality.The reason is that the drawing balance of waves and ships is wonderful.I was able to taste the real feeling that the ship was really shaking.It is a wonderful job.			"

												Very cool! I really get the ocean sailing feeling. This is only a tech demo (a really good one though) and cant find any road maps for the game. I really hope the plan is to develop this demo into a bigger experience.			"

												A fun diversion from yer landlubbin life, arghhA VR simulation of a sailboat, with basic controls (not that I could tell the difference), the water looks very good, and it's fun to sail in the 3 different conditions they provide.And it's free!  Thanks Developer(s)!			"

												It's surely interesting enough to give it a try and I like the water animations. The storm animations need a lot more sea foam. Also it would be nice to have the option for the boat to behave realisticly as currently the boat is fixed in its position and everything else revolves around.Played it on the rift with 2x pixel density and touch controllers.

												This is a cool, immersive sailing simulator. You can choose between sailing during the day, night, or in a storm. You can steer, though you're not really going anywhere. The waves move the boat realistically and greatly add to the experience. It would be nice to see a mode with calmer waters, but that's just nitpicking.When the sail swung, I thought I was about to get whacked in the head! It felt like I was really there. It was neat to sit down with my back against the wall and look out of the back of the boat. Good experience!			"

												This VR app is really a great start. I am a sailor, and I swear I could feel the boat moving under me. Three BIG things I'd like to see added:1. (and most importantly) Telltales on the shrouds. That way you could really see which way the wind was blowing. It was difficult to tell if I was on a beat or on a reach.2. Functioning main sheet to pull the boom in on a beat or let it out on a reach.3. A binnacle or other compass arrangement so you could see your heading.Great start...I love it.			"

												I would never be sailing the open sea in real life - I'm scared of open water, and oh, there are sharks out there - so this is a good way to experience that. There's not much to do besides changing the weather conditions and steering the boat: you should keep the latter to a minimum to avoid motion sickness. The water animation looks nice and it's immersive enough if you are just looking for a change of scenery.			"

												Literally nothing in this game...You get placed on a well modelled boat with a nicely animated ocean around you and the ability to awekwardly turn your boat... and that's it. There's no wind simulation to teach you sailing, no meaning to turning around, no difficulty with weather.			"

												More shovelware for VR users. It's hard to complain about something free, but this isn't a game at all. You stand still and a boat rocks around on waves. That's it. No other boats, no land, nothing to see. Much like the real activity, this is boring and is a massive waste of time.The graphics are pretty nice, so there's that. It is well modelled. But unfortunately, it's not a game at all.			"

												I live on an island (Galveston, TX), so I've been on boats before but never had the coastline out-of-sight. I have always wondered what the isolation feels like, and this VR demo allowed me to experience it. Of course there is no wind or ocean spray, but a box fan and a spray bottle could remedy that, lol. Great demo for showing off what modern VR can do.			"

												The water in VRSailing is beautiful, in VR it looks a bit more polygonal than in screenshots but it's gorgeous to see. It's a free experience, and I hope sincerely than this is a demo of something bigger to be developed.Closely to VR Regatta, here the overall detail seems bigger, but there is almost anything to do or to explore. This game implement three different weather, with strong see in almost all of them. In fact from the comfort side, it's surely a bit tough, not because of locomotion issues but because it drives me what it looks exactly some sea sick (that I suffer also in real life). Pretty impressive. VR Regatta is more comfortable, but also less realistic and especially the sea is more calm than in this one.Except from the feeling to be there, this is just an experience and there is anything you could or need to do. But is free and it's something you need to try if you love sailing. VR sailing could be a big thing, as soon as someone will build a full game or simulator around it.			"

												Also a sailor, from racing dinghies to cruising yachts. I feel the sounds could be worked on and the jerking of the boat looking aft makes me feel I am not infact there in real life but infact in a game. Never sailed a racing vessel this size but from my understanding it's what I expected to feel like when I grabbed the tiller. Main sheet and sail trim would be nice and I agree with Donald in his assessment in wanting shroud tell-tales and or wind instruments possibly under the glass sprayhood. If it kept me interested longer there may have been more issues or interesting cool things. Still thumbs up it's free.Pros: 1. It's free, someone has took the time to make a game and not put a price tag on it so no one can complain.2. It will give you an idea of what It looks like and feels like at the tiller while doing from what I can tell about 15-20 knots.3. graphics not the best but not the worst.Cons:1. Didn't feel like I was there due to the jerking of the stern and over all boat not been smooth.2. The ability to only control the tiller makes it for anyone wanting to learn sailing highly limited.3. Sounds I feel they didn't sell me and the spray didn't get anywhere close to realistic for the speed of the vessel and wave hight "

												Here's my first time gameplay video:

			Still a bit sick so sorry head of time about my voice. I never thought about how perfect sailing games would be for VR until I tried it out!		

I also review other games on my channel: www.youtube.com/c/thefishstick This game is a fanastic VR experience for something that it free. The fantastic graphics was the first thing that stuck out to me. It's very casual so it's not a sailing training simulator; you basically limited to steering the ship and thats about it. There are three different areas you can sail in (Day, Night, and Stormy). All are visually stunning. Great game for friends to try out in VR.			"

												Meh, well worth a v quick look, no land, no birds, no whales, no other ships, the waves look like the ones from super mario, BUT when the sea crashed under the yaught I swear I could feel it in my feet and the sway and the peaks and troffs of the stormy sea. And mind that main sail			"
