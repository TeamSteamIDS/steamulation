												Pros:- Realistic shots. Shoot the legs, that'll disable and/or slow them down. Shoot the head? instant kill. There's lung-shots, heart shots and much more. The animals can also bleed out! Sometimes you even have to put them down...- A truckload of already-available guns for you to use in your leisure.- Heavily customisable maps, weather, types of animals that spawn, and more!- Tents to hide away in! Enough said.- Would make a good game if it was ported to mobile/tablet devices.- Bullet-cam options!Cons:- Minor bugs, though they shouldn't really have too much effect on the game, mostly AI-related. Nothing serious like crashing or resolution errors. They actually make the game a bit easier at times! This can be a good or bad thing, depending on the person. The animals running around endlessly in a circle is a notable bug.- Graphics are a bit dated. Though those who really want to play the game are probably going look past it. Think a ""late-2000's era budget game"" graphic style.- This may only be a problem for, or only be noticed by a handful of players, but the profile name text input bar is controlled by the left and right keys. Not a very popular UI design to some.- Vehicle controls (horse and quad bike) In short, if you enjoy hidden gems like these, I'd say give it a try. I reckon it's an 8.5/10.			"

												Hunting Unlimited 2010 is a rather fun virtual hunting simulator, designed to allow you to hunt from the comfort of your computer. Various locations around the world are available, as well as various types of prey such as; Deer, Elk, Bear, Lions, Elephants, and more. I, myself enjoyed the simulated hunt in the Northeastern United States with a 30-30 Winchester Lever action, which also happens to be the same type of rifle I own and have hunted with in real life. Various scents, lures, blinds, and more are available to help you in your hunt, as well as an array of various weapon types from Rifles to Crossbows, designed to let you make your simulated hunting experience unique to your style. I have played hunting simulators in the past and this one ranks up top with the better ones, for its realistic feel and approach. The landscapes are varied and immersive, the ambient noises are a nice touch and the graphics, while not great, aren't so bad  you can't enjoy the game. If you enjoy realistic hunting simulator experiences, I would recommend this over one of those Cabela's Hunting games any day.			"

												Hunting unlimited 2010 is a good game for $10.I am not really a great fan of hunting games or games like that but i had it in the past on disk before i started racing so i thought lets take a trip down memory lane and bought the game.The graphics are better than i remembered,they are not to bad,but the animals run around in circles most of the time,when i got the game i was hopping they would have updated it for the steam edition,but no such luck.You can drive a horse and ATV in this game,the driving physics for the ATV are horrible,but its a hunting game not driving simulator.You can hunt in all hunting conditions and the locations and firearms are plenty.I definitly recomend this game,it has never crashed on me it could be more realistic when the person dies,that sound a bit bad but when u die in the game the screen just goes red.I dont have any thing bad to say about the game,i definatly recommend.

												This game is amazing.  On the surface it may look like a simple, boring game where you spend ages walking around ugly scenery trying to find a specific animal, like a video game in which one searches for a needle in a haystack the size of a planet, BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE!!!!This game is really an epic story of love, betrayal, retribution as well as deer slaughter.  The main character is actually a deep well thought out character who's constant silence is reflective of the inner turmoil within his very soul, who's feelings are expressed subtely and beautifully in his every step and every slight shake of his constant companion - his gun.  This story is expressed through a series of well thought out missions in which the player has to accomplish goals as part of his quest through the in depth world in which this epic is set.I cannot recommend this game highly enough, it is so good it is the last game you'll ever need to buy with it's never ending replayability. 10/10			"

												It was 82 degrees on the afternoon of October 10th, 2011. I was debating if I should go out deer hunting or not. There was a particular stand set that my friend Dave and I hung in June that I had not been to yet this season. Most of the times the wind was not right or it rained and I did not feel like getting wet. I don't like the heat either but I knew cooler weather will be coming in the near future. I still had to attach a pull rope to this stand because I forgot to when my friend Dave and I put the stand up. Even though it was pretty warm out and it is still early in the season the wind was perfect for this stand setup. We had an east wind.I decided to go. I jumped in the shower and used my unscented and bacteria killing soap. Then I got dressed and sprayed down each layer of clothing. I drove out to my hunting spot and sprayed down my outer layer of clothing quite liberally. I have always wanted to put a stand in this spot over the years but never have due to the walking distance. I know the big boys are in here but I just didn't want to take the time and put a stand here. Times have changed. I get more serious about my hunting every year and strive to shoot only mature bucks. I carry an extra bottle of cover scent with me at all times. Even though I took my time and tried not to work up to much of a sweat walking in, I pretty much was dripping with sweat by the time I got to my stand. Once I arrived at my stand I sprayed down very liberally again to try and cover the stench of my sweat. I then climbed into my stand, attached the rope and then hoisted up my bow. I then sprayed down a third time. Now, it was 4:30pm and finally time to start hunting.I was quite surprised by the number of squirrels I saw. They appeared to be out in record numbers. I sat in the stand watching and listening to the squirrels until about 6:00 pm. Out of the corner of my right eye, I caught movement that was not a squirrel. It was a nice big doe. I talked to my son Mitchell (Deer Slayer on BGH) and told him I will not be shooting a doe tonight unless it was an albino or a piebald. We have seen an albino doe on the property in years past so we know the genes exist here to see another albino sometime. This doe and her 2 fawns were coming from a pond that is down over a hill. They must have got up from their beds, got a drink then proceeded to come up past my stand which is in a corner of a large oak grove. There are multiple trails coming and going in every direction in the corner where my stand is and there is water down over the hill and acorn and hickory nut trees that litter the hillside where my stand is. The doe and her fawns walked past my stand on the right. I had an easy 25 yard shot on her but chose not to take it. They then walked on and came up the trail 15 yards right in front of my stand. As the big doe was walking up the trail it looked as if her eyes caught mine and I thought I was busted. She only looked at me for about 5 seconds then continued on without any signs of worry. The doe turned broadside again and I chose not to take her again. This second opportunity was very tempting but I was able to hold off. I was there to see what would come out of the bedding area just as the light was fading, if anything at all. She walked down the trail a little way and she gave me a perfect quartering away shot. Again, I chose not to take the shot. By this time 15 minutes had passed and it was now 6:15. The next 45 minutes except for more squirrels was uneventful.It was now 7:00 pm. The canopy of leaves in this area is still pretty heavy. Light was fading and I was going to give it about 15 more minutes. At 7:02 I heard a loud snap of a branch straight out in front of me. It sounded to be about 50 yards or so away. I intently was looking for what made the sound of that branch snapping. I was hoping it would be one of the big bucks that I know lives in this area. I saw a glimpse of brown passing through the trees. I now knew it was at the least a deer. I kept an intense stare on the area I knew the deer was at. It moved again and this time I saw antlers. At this point in time though I was still unsure if it was a shooter or not. The buck was continuing towards and about 30 yards away I finally had a full view of his rack. I knew at this point he was definitely a shooter. Right now he was walking straight at me and was about to walk up the same path the doe and her fawns took earlier. When he came up the embankment he stopped short of the top and looked in both directions. He decided to turn left and walk around to my right side. There was a number of trees lining the embankment so I could cautiously turn and hope he would not catch my movement. There is a large double tree off to my right and I would position myself for when he stepped out from behind this tree I would let him have it.He kept slowly walking and stopped right when he was behind that tree. I was thinking to myself I need you to take two more steps and stop. The buck must have read my mind because that is exactly what he did. I didn't have to stop him or anything. I couldn't have asked for a better scenario. I had my crossbow up and pointed already and now it was just a matter of making a small adjustment until I had the crosshairs of my scope on the kill zone. The buck gave me a 15 yard, slight quartering to shot. I pulled the trigger on my Horton Legend crossbow and let the Easton XX75 arrow tipped with the Rage 2 blade broadhead fly. I watched as it hit it's mark. I thought ahh yes!!! It was a perfect shot. I watched the buck take off like a freight train. He ran down the embankment across a flat little area back up another hill then out of sight.Once he was out of sight I began counting until I heard him crash. One thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three. Crash, crash, thrash, thrash, I heard the buck now rolling around on the ground and then I heard this deep aaaarrrrrgggghhhh. I call that the death growl. I knew he was dead. I shot him at 7:05 pm. I texted my son Mitchell at 7:06pm and wrote BBD BABY BBD JUST NAILED HIM!!!!!. My son immediately called and asked me the details. I told him at the time I think he was a big 10 pointer but I didn't look at the rack too much and I wasn't sure but I definitely knew he was a shooter and I heard him crash and he was down. I told him I would find the arrow and then call him back. I then called my friend Dave and told him and he asked me if I was sure I wanted to pursue him or wait until morning. I said I heard him crash and I heard the death growl and I knew he was down. I got down and went to the point of impact and could not find my arrow or see any blood. I walked the way the buck ran and looked for blood and any part of the arrow but I did not see any at all.My son called me back and was wondering why I didn't call him back. I said I couldn't find the arrow or any blood and I was starting to second guess myself on pursuing the buck any farther. He asked me again what happened and I told him the details. I was positive the buck was down but just in case I was wrong I did not want to push him. My son said wait and he would be out to help me find him.By the time  my son and I got back to the stand site 45 minutes had passed and it was now completely dark. But, with the help of the flashlight I won in a BGH grand slam contest I knew we could find the buck. This flashlight is awesome. It lights up everything. We walked the way the buck ran. Scanning back and forth looking for blood. Finally about 60 yards from the point of impact I spotted a drop of blood about the size of an apple seed. The blood was bubbly. The further we walked the drops were getting closer together and bigger. We reached the top of the hill where I last seen and scanned the area. We walked about another 10 yards on the blood trail and I scanned the area again. I said I see brown. My son said be careful but I knew he was dead.			"

												Nothing beats crawling for 45 minutes on the ground, easing closer and closer to two big ol' turkeys.You want the one on the left, because he is naturally bigger than the one on the right.As you move closer and closer, your heart pounds.You notice the turkey on the right is moving closer to you preventing you from moving, he is within 30 yards of your spot in the thick grass. You see the trophy tom on the left moving away from you just out of reach of your longbow. Spooking the Turkey on the right could end the hunt empty handed.You decide to go with it and ease toward the bigger tom, and as you get within 25 yards,You Draw the bow.You have to be quick before the turkeys fly off, all the practice you put in at the range with your bow leads up to this point. You released the arrow, and it flies right over the turkey's head and lands behind him.You quickly try to get in another shot, but it is too late. Both turkeys fly off as you stand up, in complete and utter frustration.over an hour spent moving like a turtle, leaves you empty handed, only to be mauled by a cougar a few moments later.9/10 would get mauled again.

												The graphics are not THAT bad, at least for being 6 years old it was ok.  Horse was pretty good, killed some bears and an eagle.  A bit boring, but it is a hunting game so the pace was sort of relaxing and the in game sounds had potential to be immersing.  Messed around with the map editor, places a ♥♥♥♥♥on of angry grizzlies in the middle of a circle of mountains, with only my double barrel shotgun and some bear bait, it was an exciting challege at first.  The AI was a bit weird, the bears circled me and bit me a couple times but it didnt kill me.  Moments later, with dozens of bear carcusses around me I was a bit disappointed that it felt easier than it should be.  Jumped off a cliff, didnt die. Touched a waiste high deep stream, instant death. Game dosen't let you kill the horse. 7/10. Buy it on sale, it might be worth a few laughs, besides that the page isn't really misleading you should know if it is something you would like or not, its definitely not for everybody.  But to scratch an old hunting game nostalgia itch it does the trick			"

												This isn't my kind of game, at all, but I still recommend it. Why? Because, on one hand, it is easy to see exactly what you are getting and whether it is a game for you. Also, on the other, it is very affordable, and, despite not being my kind of game, is actually still kind of fun. The graphics aren't great, to be honest, but aren't terrible for the time when the game was released, and at the same time are probably the biggest weakness, which is saying something. The game is stable with no issues running in Windows 10, has a variety of weaponry and game settings/locations available, and even the mechanics programmed in for animal behavior and such are realistic and stable enough so as to make the experience fairly engrossing. The big downside to the gameplay is that, quite simply, you do need to be the type of person to actually enjoy playing a game simulating hunting. That is, the (sometimes tedious) search for and slow stalking of prey, long periods of simply waiting or slowly crawling into position, etc. If you're the type of person that enjoys more constant activity in your gameplay, then this probably isn't a good choice. On the bright side though, it is a means to go hunting when you're unable/unwilling to do so in real life, and do so for a very low price for what is being offered. Even just the built in shooting range aspect, to get a feel for the various weapons, is far more fun than I was expecting - largely because of the precision targeting and fine tuning of your aim that the game makes both possible and necessary. While the hunting itself can generally be done without quite so much precision being needed, there is a deep satisfaction that comes from getting one's aim just right to hit the most distant bullseye with your chosen weapon. For the price, it's a great choice.			"

												Pros - Definitely the best, most realistic hunting simulators out there. The gameplay is very enticing, the physics work, and most importantly, it feels like I am actually hunting.Cons - Has some (MINOR) glitches. VERY MINOR stuff. For example, the framerate can sometimes max out at 30, 45, or 60 depending on how the game feels. THIS IS OKAY and let me tell you why. It's okay because the human eye can only see about 24 frames per second. Also, you cannot swim in this game, but who needs swimming? IT'S A HUNTING GAME. Whoever does not like this great simulator can go suck PETA's ♥♥♥♥ some more cause this game is here to stay.10/10.			"

												This is a decent hunting game but kind of has the feel of previous hunting games. The graphics look old, but the gameplay is there. Its fun if you like to explore different lands in different scenarios. The lions really get you jumping in your seat, you just got to wait for the prime time to shoot. There are a wide variety of guns and weapons to choose from, all have their strengths and weaknesses. This is a fun game to play around with and mess around with the animals. I do recommend this game to any hunter just looking to play around for a bit because you will be satisfied as to how simple it is to hunt the specific animal you are searching for. As in the previous games you have various modes of transportation while traveling across the terrains. This is a great casual game and I recommend it for and old school shooter that wants to hunt animals for fun.			"

												3/10 - Hunting RTS.. Not good.Even for 5 year old graphics this it's bad. Basically, you place decoy animals, huts, traps etc. to catch the object. Good idea... but not really. I hope I didn't pay real money for this. Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more. Free Keys and Reviews weekly!

												This is the best game ever; I am surprized this game has not won game of the year yet! Without a thought this game is the best. The story line tells one more epic then Fallout,Skyrim,Assassins Creed,and Runescape put together. There are more guns in this game then I think were ever created by man. This game would make your great great great grandfather turn over in his grave. I cant even come close to tell you how well this game makes me horny. I am not sure how I went to bed at night before without this game. I love this game. If you dont like this game you should not be alive. I love you Hunting Unlimited 2010.... I love you.			"

												game from 2009 with the name 2010 and the graphics from 2000... for someone who grew up with duck hunt for the NES, this might be a good game, (ok if i think about it, duck hunt was actually more fun...) but for everyone else its probably outdated and boring after a short time.positive is that it has a good tutorial, a bunch of weapons to choose from, different gamemodes and also a wide range of animals, different environments to play.the arcade like music is also good.the hitbox seems a bit weird to me... you can shoot down several birds in a mission, without proper aiming, but its easy to miss a grown deer.what could be a reason to buy this game? well you could say a steam sale, or the desire to get a computer hunting game!  -> BUT:unfortunately we live in the year 2014, and if you want to play a great and entertaining hunting simulator, there are much better and free alternatives.  ( for example:  www.thehunter.com).			"

												Horrible game, shame I can not get a refund.The run is the worst part, if you use a quad or horse the animals flee, if you run then you need to put a weight on the 'W' keys as it takes ages to get anywhere.Deer Hunter 2005 was much better.			"

												Um, there was a moose, it ran around in a circle. I shot, it missed, and the moose ran around in circles.There was a deer, my crosshair refused to go on top of it.Every second playing this game felt like I was playing a hunting mode in Call of Duty.4/10, Don't buy this game, spend your $10 for a better game, or spend a little more for a better hunting game.

												The biggest piece of crap I've ever seen. If I was in a room with this game and a fully fueled chainsaw and had to pick between cutting my toes off or playing this game, I'd ask for a second chainsaw and saw off both feet to save time.Don't let this game near me ever again.			"

												This game allows you to kill innocent animals which, as a vegetarian, is quite frankly sickening and disgusting. However, the game also includes the option to drive around on a quad bike which I consider to be a highly redeeming factor.Much recommended.			"

												If you can get past the low graphics there's a very relaxing game here. The game goes like this:1) Select your target animal(s), location and equipment.2) Track your target animal(s). You can use an RV or a horse to get around the big maps, and binoculars/calls to figure out where your target is. You can also use decoy animals and scents to bring your prey to you. Most animals will smell/see/hear you from a long way off so you have to hide yourself well. You can bring a tree seat and hide up in the branches, set up a camoflagued tent or just lie down in some nearby bushes.3) Wait. This can take ages so it's a good game for audiobooks/podcasts. Occasionally make a call (not too often or you'll scare it off). When your target gets close enough, bring out your weapon (there's a variety of rifles, shotguns and a few bows/crossbows) and shoot the bugger.4) If you hit it in the right spot it'll die instantly, sometimes it'll run off and die of blood loss so you'll have to track it down. Tag your animal and it goes off to the trophy room.There are also a lot of missions if you want something more structured, but there's a good variety of environments and animals to keep you occupied. You can also go to Africa and hunt elephants/lions for some reason. There's a modpack that adds new equipment, skins and weapons: go get that too. If you enjoy sniping games or enjoyed the hunting in games like Red Dead Redemption you might enjoy this.			"

												Hunting Unlimited 2010 might be the most pointless game ever developed, and I cannot heartily enough recommend it. If you've ever wanted to shoot an elk with a crossbow through the ear, this -- and this alone -- is the game for you.After hours of pointing rocket launchers at enemies with poor to nonexistent AI, there's some part of the gamer's soul that just wants to shoot some animals with no clearly existent AI whatsoever other than running in a random path and occasionally dying if you hit it enough times. It's such a brilliantly pointless experience, and every moment seems to say to the player, ""why are you doing this?""From arrows that get lodged in the side of the invisible wall at the edge of the map to the cars and buildings that exist as uninteractive setpieces, every element of Hunting Unlimited 2010 beckons the player to think about the absurdity of the entire game. ""Is that animal a ghost?"" asks the player character. Yes, JohnDoe. Yes it is. Isn't it a beautiful ghost?			"

												I used to have this game on disc before it was released on Steam, it was a VERY fun game. I could no longer run it on disc for about 2 years, then I bought a $50 dollar game card and I was looking for hunting games when I found this! In my deepest thanks, Steam. Thank you for adding the HU franchise as purchasable games.			"
