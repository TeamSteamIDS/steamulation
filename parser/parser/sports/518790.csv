It's completely relaxing just to hear pines waving on the wind somwhere over Rotwald area, listening to rain, storm, forest, just close eyes and have that short break on digital nature during day. For real it's best audio-video application for PC and when it comes to give true nature feeling  Call of the Wild is beyond any competition for years. It's great to turn this game on for a few minutes during workday and relax. Not to mention You can easily spend hours and have enormous fun during hunting here.Night hunts or ability to seamless walk/trek/hunt/ in 24 hour cycle is great and going after wounded animal through dark forest is da bong. Especially when you chase wounded 400 kg wild boar in dense forest around midnight...Feelings , presentation and realism are above perfect. If you have ever been on real hunt just buy it. Game have some UI bugs in menu but it will be fixed with 1 or 2 patches. No other problems.Shooting and tracking are real - it works exactly the same in Real life - some hunts are very easy some are long and no outcome - but for real hunter most important is respect for nature and harmony with it - this game as only one in pc gaming history gives that well.

Night hunts are just thrilling - imagine rural field after harvests at midnight , full moon and you on the hunting tower watching pack of wild boars roaming the field after mouses and seeds .Yes You have head lamp and if You miss vitals or hit [like in real life] big boar it can run good hundreds of meters after.Searching for animal at night are just amazing! Check my uploaded screenshots to understand !YES YOU CAN TURN OFF ALL HELPERS [ very detailed and lot of options to  choose from ! ] and act like in RL.To say more i just forget after few minutes that im playing a game [35 years old here] and feel like in archive movie from one of my hunts in real life. All works the same - animals reacts different , depends when bullet hits, etc. Together with video-audio work of art presentation it makes amazing job. No one ever bring so much real poetry in digital gaming presentation of nature than Expansive Worlds did here.

This game have so many features that it will be very hard to describe them all. And all of them are well tested and realized in the game. If You ask yourself ""is that feature is here?"" - answer YES it is. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885844967 If you are looking for ethic game about hunting to interest your kids or friends with hunting it's best title ever released. There is no better PC program that can awake love to the nature than this game [and please all eco terrorists who don't even know what real hunting is about just shut up and keep chains around trees still  as simplest hunter did more to ecosystem and nature than band of ecologist through whole their life] .Details are just breathtaking ! Shoots are dependable by range, wind, position, after unlocking some skills and perks [ great by the way , very good mechanics and very real too ! ] . Someone really knows how to present real hunting!And if you only have occasion just listen to Pines waving on strong wind at Rotwald mountians at first reserve. Did i mention that leaves flying from trees depend on which driection wind is flowing? Good. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885526048 Forget about The Hunter - just sink into this title and beg Devs to develop it further [its just great joy to simply walk in this game] - personally i will pay for all DLC for it , and im sure we get some free dlcs too.You are like on real hunt here in Call of the WIlds , im playing on I5 Haswell, 16gb Ram and 1060 Geforce , all on ultra and high - and trust me - stable FPS around 50-60 , and DAT FEELING along with excellent sounds [you will hear very high range of nature sounds, different for each bush, plants, grass, day and night or even part of day or night ] . There is NO DIFFERENCE in visual or sound presentation with normal, real life hunt.Im completely shocked - Light in this game works like in real life too , you will almost feel wet cold mornings, warm sunsets, scary storms. Just like in real life simple walking through woods [hello no one generic fragment of land, each is handplaced and designed like real life, no boring terrain all over the map].About bugs - i havent noticed any in game about what is essential - hunting , tracking, playing .There are small and very minor buggies with UI but it will be easily solved by small patches so really screw negative reviews. If You are hunting in real life, if You love nature, if You hunted long ago, if You are interested in hunting, if You are looking for best looking game on PC , if You are looking for intelligent and enormous hunting application , if You are looking for enjoyable multiplayer hunts [not so embarassing like in the hunter online - all is really better here ] - JUST GO BUY and THANK Devs for realizing every hunter dream ! http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885651194 ABOUT ""BUGS"" : Shortly: Leave bugs to vegans and keep hunting and eating meat instead.Longer:And please stop listening people about shooting - it works exactly like in rl life - not only shooting [wind guess [after perk - eralier by observing nature], magnitude setup [after perk] but a way of the bullet mechanics after the hit.If someone never shoot on real hunt he just simple can't understand that hit which lands on ""soft"" part of the animal only wounds it and make a lot of pain and hunter is obliged to track it even 2 days with dogs. If You want to score animal learn to shoot and read some hunting books. Devs here are one of most dedicated and involved in gaming industry and their fame for long supporting of titles is well known, just look at older brother theHunter Classic.And i bet this wonderfull game, Call of the Wild will become it's successor.There are many ""headshooters"" from stupid fps games around here , who never hold and fire from real gun. Trust me this game is as close to real shooting and hunting as it can be. Not only visually [dat scopes GOD! almost smell rubber near eye] , but what is most important from shooting mechanic. There is Bullet drop, wind , calibre and power incorporated and very smart and real hit system.  SO ALL OF YOU COD/CS SONS GO SCREW YOURSELF KIDOS.See You in the wilds !!!Developers please keep this game supported and developed in next years as it's best and most realistic hunting experience ever created. I will gladly pay for future DLCs, and remember about some freeLC too. Just give us more of eveything in next years and we have a deal!			"

												This is my first review of a game, but I though this game deserved a review as it's been getting a lot of negative reviews that are unwarranted in my opinion. I live in South Africa and have been hunting a couple of times before and it's something I enjoy. What I enjoy about hunting is that you go out into wide open spaces of beautiful nature. You have to patiently stalk your prey, following spoor (tracks), looking at their dung, checking that you're not upwind. It's not easy, and some days you can go the whole day without even getting close to having a shot at your prey.So in context of this game, I never thought I'd ever find or enjoy any hunting game that gives me the same thrill as I get in real life. But I was wrong. This game does really well in making you feel like you're in this beautiful nature reserve with some of the best graphics and sound design I've seen in a game. It really is stunning. I often just stare at a beautiful sunrise or a strong gust of wind blowing leaves off the trees around me. The beautiful world you get to play in alone is worth the asking price for this game.The actual hunting part has been done extremely well. In this game I've felt like it really is quite close to hunting in real life. Patience is key. Checking wind direction, following tracks, listening for your prey's sounds, looking at your prey's dung etc. has been really well thought out and implemented. It can take hours to find and hunt the prey you're looking for, but it feels worth it. I've seen a lot of people complain about bugs in their reviews, and I have seen a couple, but none of them were game breaking in my opinion. If that is what is holding you back from buying this game, then let me assure you, it's not that bad. The bugs aren't that major, and I have to say that it runs extremely well on my machine. My settings are all cranked up and I'm running a GeForce 970, 8GB RAM, Intel i5 2500k processor, and have experienced no lag or crashes.If you want a game to get lost in, that takes time and patience, that is beautiful and realistic, then give this a go. I hope they bring out an African map in a future DLC!			"

												Let's get something straight right off the top here... this is, by far, one of the most graphically beautiful simulations of an outdoor environment currently available.  Period.  I've been gaming for over 30 years, and this game, with it's accurate global illumination and sunlight simulation, is one of the most immersive experiences I've ever seen thanks to their Apex open world engine.  This is the kind of thing that the next Elder Scrolls game NEEDS, and it's almost worth the $30 price just as a walking simulator alone!  Yeah, it's THAT good.  Even the audio is fantastic... realistic bird calls, buzzing insects, breezes blowing through the trees, etc....it feels like I'm actually walking through a woodland setting.  It's awesome!Note: you need a reasonbly good PC to get all the eye candy at anything above 50-ish fps and people with lesser machines have complained about poor performance.  I can max out all details at 2560x1440 and get between 50~60 fps.  (See the bottom of my review for system specs.)But anyway, the graphics and sound goodies are where the list of awesome things about this game ends.  I really WANT to be able to recommend this game, but the rest is a mixed bag of bugs, broken features, and insanely baffling design decisions that leave me not only nearly speechless, but also more than a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off.  Back on release day, BluesNews.com posted an article that said that this game had been release as Early Access, but the article was in error because it was, in fact, a full release with no mention of Early Access.  However, that's EXACTLY what this game feels like, and if you haven't been to the forums or read a lot of other reviews yet, you'll see that plenty of other players say the same thing.  Normally I'm pretty forgiving of bugs and whatnot, but in this case, I just can't cut this much slack.Some bugs have been fixed with a recent patch, but it's far from enough, and some of the worst bugs still remain.  Some of those most obvious bugs involve the animal AI, which is ironic considering the fact that it's a core element to the entire purpose of the game,  For example, it's common to encounter animals that don't seem to notice the player and will stand completely still as you walk right up to them.  It's like being in a ""West World"" kind of place where the animals are robots and they sometimes malfunction.  They also get stuck in terrain and rocks, causing them to run in place indefinitely.The whole game has a ""console-ish"" feel, like it's made for kids or something, compared to Expansive Worlds' other game, theHunter Classic, which is much more comprehensive, although doesn't look as good.  Pretty much everything in the game has to be unlocked by visiting points on the map or shooting certain animals or whatever.  You have to earn cash to buy lures, ammo, weapons, and everything is laughably expensive.  I suppose this is a viable method of giving the player a reason to keep hunting, but it also lends to an ""arcade-like"" experience.  They claim the game went through beta ""testing"", but if that's true, then their beta testers were far less competent than they needed to be.  Or maybe the testers reported the bugs and the devs chose to ignore them.  Either way, most of the problems this game has are inexcusable and could not possibly have any sort of intelligent explanation as to how they made it into the final release.Other issues that drive me nuts... - Placing a waypoint on the map does NOT put a marker on your HUD or the Hunter Mate device, which requires you to keep opening the map to make sure you're heading in the right direction.  100% useless feature. - The compass is supposed to allow for ""free"" or ""fixed"" rotation, but it's always on ""fixed"" regardless of the setting. - The Hunter Mate randomly stops showing the track directional cones while you are tracking animals. - Keyboard & mouse players cannot move slowly which means you're always making maximum noise.  (You have to use a game controller and the analog movement stick to ""sneak"" successfully.) - Occassionally, a random deer or two will come out of nowhere, running in a perfectly straight line, and hit you at full speed, causing health damage as they continue off on their merry way.  Frightening. - Animal tracks sometimes double back on themselves and then disappear, even though you don't actually see the animal cross your path as the tracks indicate. - Animals often give ""warning calls"" to let you know that your presence has been detected by either sound, scent, or sight, even though you're A.) not making any noise, B.) down wind, and C.) visually obstructed by hundreds of meters of solid earth, otherwise known as a hill or mountain.  There's some debate as to whether or not the animals actually have the ability to detect you or perhaps their behavior is mostly random.  (It seems random to me.) - Even though the visuals are stunning, the water reflections are CRAP.  I mean, absolute garbage.  You'd have to see them to know what I mean, but I find it absurd that so much of the game's engine is so beautiful, and then they totally ♥♥♥♥ up the water reflection shader.  The water looks much better if you just turn off the reflections.  Not as realistic, no, but still acceptable. - Rain sounds rapidly cut off/on while standing near any body of water.  (Sort of sounds like the ""whop whop whop"" of helicopter blades.) That's not an exhaustive list by any means, but if you want to get an idea of the other issues people have discovered, head over to the discussions and check out the Bug Reports section.  Sure, the game is still playable, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't get some entertainment out of it despite all the times it has made me cross-eyed with rage, but if your'e the kind of person who expects near perfection from their games and is easily annoyed by really obvious bugs, I would avoid this one, for now at least.  Maybe check back in a few weeks or so and see if the game has been patched up some more, but as it stands right now, I can't recommend this game.Specs:  (no overclocking)i7-6700KGTX 107016 GB RAM500 GB SSDSoundBlaster Z			"

												This is from the perspective of someone who has been a huge fan of theHunter: Classic for many years and have quite a bit of time and money invested in it.Call of the Wild is a beautiful game environment and solid hunting mechanics; which will feel familiar to veteran Classic players and not too daunting for new hunters to the 'series'.I've seen a lot of people ask if this is anything like Cabela's. I would have to say that CotW is FAR superior to Cabela's; but still maintains a 'casual' hunter feel to it. There are still a few launch issues and bugs however, which really should have been ironed out from the Beta before retail release; including some issues that aren't dissimilar to what has or is being experienced in theHunter: Classic (specifically MP issues). Pros: -Gorgeous graphics-Great sound design-Reserves are very well designed and visually interesting.-Dynamic weather system is well implemented.-Smooth animations and weapons feel like they have weight.-Players can jump! This might sound ridiculous to put on a pro's list; but it's one of the biggest features I wanted in Classic.-Stalking animals is MUCH easier. This could also be listed as a Con.-Progression system with XP, Money and Weapon skill, that will keep you striving to improve.-MASSIVE hunting reserves.-Similar game mechanics to Classic, that makes the game familiar for veteran Classic players. -Good tutorial and hint system for new hunters. -Much further render distance for all the long-shot enthusiasts.Cons: -A few UI issues (unable to click some elements, or non-responsive elements)-Experienced a couple of crashes due to entering the System Settings menu. (work-around is to change settings, then restart the game. Another suggestion is to disable cloud-sync in Steam).  -Animals aren't as 'hard' when it comes to Spook range and flee distance from weapon firing. -MP has a few issues. Most noticeably with desync (shooting animals that aren't actually there). -Joining an MP game can spawn you out of bounds, or with 0 health. (This isn't game breaking from my experience as it respawns you near the host. )-Can't quit to Main Menu - only to Desktop.-Can't progress your characters environment/lore/tower unlocks in MP. -No in-depth stats tracking and weapon skill progression compared to Classic. -Progression flow is a bit off (Receiving missions and being advised to use specific callers; which you can't yet unlock due to level or money requirements)-No truRacks system.-Some may find the game too grindy to unlock new weapons and itemsAll in all, I would still recommend this game in spite of its launch issues; if you can tolerate a few bugs. If you are expecting a 100% flawless release, then perhaps give this title a miss until the developers have ironed a few creases out. I'll happily update this review in the near future to accurately reflect any developer changes to anything listed above; or anything new they introduce.I hope this helps!			"

												Ok so, here I am. One of those guys who's going to give the game a positive review. I've read many of the negative reviews and most of them are actually fact based and have legitimate complaints (instead of people who just hate hunting games saying they hated it.  If you're listening, don't play warcraft if you hate elves and dwarves, and stop playing grand theft auto if you hate cars.)   So, yes, the game has many issues which need to be fixed ASAP and many others which we would all like to see dealt with over time. Having said that,  this game was a great way for me and a close friend to spend some time walking through the woods, when we are too far away to do it in real life. (not to mention, regulations on hunting here are a bit more strict than in game where you can bag 6-7 deer in one evening haha)  The scenery is great, its well done, has a ton of variation, and lots of space. Its also pretty simplistic in its design, not a ton of gimmicky stuff that isn't needed... Have you been way out in the woods before? Its a lot like this game shows. The feel of the firearms is good, the sounds (when they work) are good, the animal behavior is above exceptable, the game offers challenge as well, since you don't start playing, and an hour later have every piece of gear available. I like the ""grindy"" aspect of it. Maybe others don't but I call this a bonus. The game is quite relaxing and slow paced, perfect for when you need a break from the typical ADHD shooters of our current time or bucket-of-ice-cold-water to the face pvp most online games throw at you.  I like to put this one on the big screen in the living room with a fire going and an ice cold lager, and take my time looking down those fields and wandering the woods. Definitely a relaxing, low stress title here.  So, what needs fixing? well...Plenty.   I'll write more about it in suggestions, and hopefully some Devs can take a look at what I have to say!TL;DR    Yes its not perfect, but with some work it easily could be one of, or even THE greatest hunting game title (depending on what you're after)  Is it worth the cost?  I'm going to say yes, but only with the stipulation that they continue to work on it, and provide the community with more content and bug fixes without asking for more money.EDIT:   wanted to include what i posted in suggestions.Ok, so I've only played about 10 hours so far, but I thought I should write this while the thoughts are fresh in my mind.  I'll start by saying that I gave this a positive review in steam, and suggested people take a closer look at it.  I spent quite a few hours last night having a lot of fun playing multiplayer with a close friend of mine.  We talked a lot on discord and discussed a few of the issues people are complaining about, as well as some of the bugs and issues we encountered ourselves.  I think this game is really good already and potentially will be amazing.  Having said that, here are a few things I would like to draw some attention to (in no particular order);1. Option of ""exit to main menu/home screen""  I really think this should have been here already, and many agree.  Exiting to desktop is a bit annoying, especially for people on my friends list who see ""mike is playing, mike stopped playing, mike is playing"" lol.  Lets add a ""quit to main menu""?2. In Multiplayer, only the person hosting is able to interact with the (?) on the map. As far as we could tell last night, only the host is able to fast travel as well. This is a huge disadvantage and also makes no sense. It would be nice to say ""hey, lets all meet at the lodge/outpost for a moment and restock and regroup"" or something. It can take a while if you get separated to walk all the way to your friend!  Not to mention, wandering up to a landmark or lookout and not being able to do anything, or being unable to build a blind, etc.  Lets make it so anyone can use these things!3. Money.  So, I have no huge issue with this but I wanted to add a few personal points here. I think the money system should be scaled a bit.  I'm going to use $, so please euro players, etc, bear with me (i'm canadian but I'll use USD).  A box of ammunition doesn't cost 300$ in real life.  and the normal hunting rifles a regular person buys (i'm talking AVERAGE here) are maybe 2000$ or even less.  (I bought a browning for 800 once, and it even came with a scope).  I think charging 30,000$ is a bit high. Perhaps have the money earned cut down a bit, and then scale the cost of things for a bit more realism.  I'd suggest 20 rounds of ammunition for lets say 45-50$4.Sound issues.  Some people don't have this, but a few I've spoken to do. I don't know about you but for me, there is nothing worse than waiting an hour for that perfect tag to show up (deer, etc) and lining up your perfect shot and then ""silence"" when you pull the trigger.  It's quite anticlimactic when that happens. Not to mention the calls sometimes being silent, or rain sounding a bit buggy, etc.  I hope these sound bugs are eliminated soon. Not a deal breaker for me, but should be addressed.5.Here's one I haven't seen anyone mention. Why do female characters run like the flash? Friend of mine literally leaves me in the dust when we're moving together (and yes I triple checked, i'm running, not walking)  She ran about 85% faster than my male character. Is this a bug or intentional? Do male characters get some other bonus like carrying more weight or something? (not being sexist, just asking)  Is there a point in playing as a male when you can essentially speedwalk as a female?6. Wildlife changes.  Bird hunting should be added (and forgive me if it is but I haven't unlocked it)  if you're going to have shotguns in the game, there should be geese, duck, turkey, pheasant...whatever.  As far as I can tell this isn't really a thing. Can anyone confirm? I've not read anything definite so far, but some have told me there is no such gamebirds added. More wildlife would be nice too, but mostly just the bird hunting (a favorite of mine in real life) is something I'd love to see.7.Group activity.  It would be fun in multiplayer to have some quest/challenge that is co-operative. Maybe a party system or something where if 2 people collaborate on a kill, they share the rewards, regardless of who pulled the trigger. 9.I've heard this mentioned before but,  seasons.  Would be kind of interesting if you could make some selections when starting a multiplayer like winter, rain on or off, night only, day only, fall, spring...etc.  Some other maps/terrain variations in general would be nice (sort of goes along with that)  Just vague ideas I'm throwing out here. 10. Firing range, practice. Something like that might be useful for those who have never hunted or shot in real life, or are new to these types of games.   Well, that's all for now, I welcome any comments and bumps.			"

												Updated review after 52 hours in and 4 updates.TL;DR: this game should be marked as an EARLY ACCESS GAMEWhile I can understand the dev's motivation to urge users to report bugs, I cannot fathom how they can release this game as a ""finished product"" but treat their customers as early access testers.Bugs I've encountered:- Animals get stuck and stand still. They cant run away. You can pet them.- Sometimes you get stuck in a bush and then die of falling damage.- Trashiest, clunkiest and buggiest UI ever. Even after the patch you have to (at least) click twice on stuff and pray for it to work.- Apparently not only the wildlife, but also the UI buttons require a hunter's precision. If you don't click on a specific area within the option you want to navigate through, the game won't recognize your click (UI is absolutely buggy and has ""hidden hitboxes"").- Map doesn't center around you when you open it. First few moments upon openning the map have to be spent on zooming in/out and finding where you are.- There seems to be no consistency regarding the ""loudness of the sounds"" you create. Crawling through bush X in this area is silent. Crawling through bush the same bush in another area is suddenly loud. Also wind and rain seem to not have an effect on your (displayed) sound-level.- After playing some time with your Phone (ingame item that helps you tracking) out, your fps start to drop from 50+ to 13. Only happens when the phone is out. Then the next bug kicks in...- Suddenly all tracks vanish and don't ever appear again. Renders tracking impossible. You have to restart the game. Going into the menu and back ingame is not possible, since there is no button to return to the menu.- The scope on the rifle bugs out as soon as you start using a bow. Use a bow and your rilfe's scope will be rendered useless (don't use a bow).- Not receiving skill points all though I get notified I got one (?)- Not receiving perk points all though I get notified I got one (?)+ Many more bugs OTHERS discoveredTechnically not a bug, but simply bad design:) You can't walk through some bushes (which is fine in itself), but in some areas they are placed en masse which turns said area into a maze. You have to navigate your way through hip-tall bushes that in RL you wouldn't even need to bend but here they are WALLS. Try to jump over them and you die of falling damage (that is a bug though).

												Alright guys, so after playing this game for a bit,  I find a lot of good things.  The graphics are outstanding, the hunting is fun,  however I feel like there should be some more content in the game,  its good but could use some trap/skeet ranges or something,  maybe some more guns,  and FISHING,  the devs should add fishing.

												I would say in its current state don’t buy it unless you really like the original thehunter. Right now there are a lot of bugs and glitch’s. This game should have been an early access to be honest. Overall the game is pretty fun, the graphics are fantastic, the side missions are fun yet challenging and the overall realism is pretty good. I would say after 3-6 months this game should be in a good state for a purchase but right now I would say wait a bit. 7/10			"

Tl;dr:This game looks absolutely gorgeous, the performance are great (i5 4590 and a GTX 970, 40/50 FPS at Full HD with Ultra settings) and the gameplay is fun albeit slow paced, suited for both casual and hardcore gamers.There are some bugs to be ironed out but I haven't found anything gamebreaking yet.The most annoying thing is the inability to select the walking speed with mouse and keyboard (it's possible only with a controller) but it's already been worked on. - Fixed with patch 1.2I've also found out that for now some achievements can't be unlocked - Fixed with patch 1.2No crashes on my side but I've read reports of freezes/continuous crashes from Windows 10 users, so if you're not a Win7 user I'd advise caution buying right now Pro: Beautiful graphics and sceneries, really good audio compartmentWell optimized: an i5 4590 and a GTX 970 are enough to play at Full HD with everything maxed Ultra settings* (maxing Shadows causes FPS drops in various places) with 40/50 FPS stableFun (albeit slow) gameplay, suited for both casual gamers and hardcore hunters: the game helps you find tracks, downed animals and even collectibles, and you can tailor your experience by enabling/disabling each option individuallyNo microtransaction or additional fees Con: The UI is pretty buggy and not clear to read, especially the ingame map and manual UPDATE: after patch 1.2 the map is still kind of glitchy but the ""noise/visibility meter"" has been fixed and now works properlyIt's currently impossible to select the walking speed using mouse and keyboard, which means that you'll always make a lot of noise scaring animals. Devs have announced that they're already working on it and should be addressed with the next patch - Thanks to patch 1.2  is now possible to do so even with keyboard and mouseThere are many other generic bugs but the devs are really active and have already released four big patches to address most if not all of the gamebreaking onesWildlife's AI has some flaws but I haven't noticed totally unnatural or crazy behaviour - UPDATE: 15 hours in I've found a single case of animal stuck in place, besides that the AI feels really natural (shot a buck, almost been charged to death by him while the other does of the pack ran away - it was awesome)Around half of the achievement are bugged and can't be unlocked, mainly the trophy-related ones - This is now fixed and every achievement unlocked but not awarded due to the bug has been credited to me as soon as I loaded my savegame "

												This game should have been an early access title.Random crashes, bad multiplayer, bad AI, wonky menus are just a few of the problems I have with this game. With that said, I'm still having fun with this game. But that is primarly because of the people I play with. The game does have a good base, but it needs a lot of polish and expanding.Simply put: This game needs the Early Access tag for me to recommend it.Edit: Removed ""very slow progression"" from my list, since they fixed this in the latest update.

												My review is based on how the game is NOW and not what it COULD be.The game is stunning, i have everything set at max and its awesome id love to see a VR version. The sounds are great infact the whole FEEL of the game is really nice.Im not a hunter, never have been and never will be and at first i had no idea what im supposed to do in the game. There is no TUTORIAL and the basic guide at the start does well in starting you but i needed to watch a few youtube videos to help. I played for around an hour just wondering around in crouch wondering why i cant find any animals. Found a rabbit and killed it, felt awesome but nope rabbits dont count. At that point i was going to quit but i stook with a little longer and i finally found a deer. Boom headshot, but wait it just ran off. Ok so apparently headshots arent the best way to kill an animal. So i followed it and managed to get another shot at it and managed to kill it with one more shot. Went upto its body and harvested it and was presented with a screen which showed an xray of the animal and alsorts of cool info and that was me hooked.The game does have quite a few BUGS, i wouldnt say they were game breaking bugs but they can be pretty annoying. Id have a look in the TECHNICAL ISSUES discussion to see more on bugs but overall ive enjoyed the game.So why am i giving this a NEGATIVE REVIEW. Well its mostly because the game feels like an early access game right now. The DEVS seem to be fixing bugs and hopefully will listen to the public and make a few changes and add a few things. There is also talk on PAID DLC which id prefer them to focus on the main game first but this game does have serious potential and i will change my review accordingly.In short the game is playable and very enjoyable if you can stand a few annoying bugs. If your the kind of person who hates any kind of bugs id suggest adding this to your watchlist and checking back in a few weeks/months. Unfortunately there is no NEUTRAL option on here so i have chosen NEGATIVE.			"

												POST 1.21 PATCH:LOTS OF GAME FREEZES... STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME.Post 1.2 patch:None of the big 3 bugs fixed, disappearing tracks, crashes and Zombie slow walking after interrogating lots of tracks.They have managed to 'balance' the cost of ammo (ie now costs 3 times the amount.)Seriously, did anyone other than the 'realism above fun' brigade ask for this?   Animals freezing, getting stuck on terrain and ignoring running players that's what needs fixing, not trying to stop players buying all the gear due to getting ingame currency.Fix the animal AI, that'll add to the realism.  But therein lies the problem, they know how to raise the price of ammo and not a clue what to do with the animal AI, otherwise it would have been fixed in the Hunter...Just thought I'd share my last hunt with you:Killed a coyote for a mission, but it didn't count, found the answer on the forum, you have to hold the .270 whilst harvesting it.  A fixed is promised.Start again, shot a deer with the bow, harvested it.  I found a coyote and tried to use the .270 Huntsman, but the scope wouldn't work, because I'd used a bow first... a known bug .Start again, made sure I looked down the rifle scope first, to stop the  bow bug.  Shot a nice Stag for a mission with the bow, the game locked as soon as I shot it. Had to restart my computer, otherwise it will lock up again.Immersive, Realistic?  I'll leave it up to you to decide.Updated 28 Feb. 108 hours!As Stefan asked to let let him know how I like it after the 1.1 patch, I'll post on what bugs are still extant after 1.1 (along with the new ones it has caused):CONS:1. Game can crash and lock up the pc with loud audio, no 'COTW_F stopped working message'.   This didn't happen for me before 1.1.  The program needs to be stopped with the task manager.This happened to me within a couple of minutes in game and kept happening until the pc was restarted.  Happened yesterday to a friend I was in TS with.2.  The Zombie speed bug is still there after you interrogate a lot of tracks, having to select HM then a weapon, to get around it, is a pain.3.  There seems to be a finite amount of tracks, a few times in a long hunt, animals I have shot and killed have left no tracks, it was pure luck I found the body. (I tried using the light in case it was a day/night problem.)4.  UI still clunky, .270 hollow point ammo still locked even with sufficient rifle skill, unlockable Stands... STILL!5.  Animals stuck in trees, rocks and the animation where the animal freezes and does a slow piroutette is hilarious.6.  Animals reacting to callers, regardless of species, if you don't have a certain caller, use anyone, it'll work.  Both predator callers use the same sound file, but there again a lot of animals use the same warning calls... still not fixed.7.  Animals in groups ignoring shots, allowing the entire herd to be killed. (Not sure whether this should be a pro!)PROS:1.  It is very pretty, which is the main theme of all the positive reviews.2.  Positive reviews make a great deal of how realistic and immersive it is, if you have frozen, 'rotating on the spot' animals where you hunt, then this game might be considered realistic!I'll say it again, this could be a cracking game... I'll post more after the next big patch.Another update, 53 hours in, but first, some quotes from positive reviews:'There are still a few launch issues and bugs however, which really should have been ironed out from the Beta before retail release; including some issues that aren't dissimilar to what has or is being experienced in theHunter: Classic (specifically MP issues).It has some buges, but I believe those will be patched soon.'There's a plethora of <10 hours played positive reviews coming out, it's just a shame the IP addresses aren't displayed ;)Ok, on with the review:A few crashes, but not enough to make me give up on it yet, Ooh I'm stubborn!Today's highlights:Thanks to the posts in discussions about how to change map without restarting (Kudos to the OPs), I went to North America.  I had difficulty walking without treading on animals, so different to Hirsch!  I could see for miles and levelled up so quickly, it made me look as though I knew what I was doing. (Which my TS mates know to be untrue.)Problems with North America:Some buildable items don't appear on the map and aren't buildable.Shot some animals which don't leave tracks (this was just before the game crashed.)Some of the animal audio clues are very slow or looped, actually I rather like this, it made me laugh to hear a 10 times slowed whitetail call, talk about a wet F**t!Thank you to the people who've added me and asked me whether to buy it on the strength of my review.  I'm new to this and I'm trying to do it as honestly as I can.Update after day 2:A positive note!I only had one crash on startup and zero crashes whilst ingame.. I believe in giving credit where credit is due and the hotfixes appear to have lessened the crashes for me. (As they did in the beta hotfixes.. so why weren't they included in the release version?)I am, however, amazed by the state in which this game was released... this is the official workaround for being unable to change key bindings ingame:'Disable cloud saving on Steam (Properties -> Updates -> Untick Steam Cloud Synchronization)Go to Documents\Avalanche Studios\theHunter Call of the Wild\Saves open your save folderOpen “keymap.json” with a text editor of your choice (e.g. Notepad)Manually adjust keybindingsSave file and start the game (keeping cloud save disabled until you have started it once)'Quick question... this is a release version and not early access?  If something as simple as keybindings is screwed up, then it doesn't bode well for the game.Ok, into day 2's review:I played this game a lot today, 30 something hours in (including it's older sibling - the beta!)A few observations, it would be nice if:1. I could go to the map and not have a random view nowhere near where my player is, at a scale where I could see where I am.2. Red Deer, Roe Deer and other animals didn't share the same audio for warning calls. (Reported in Beta)3. The hit boxes worked (even some of the EW affiliated tubers made mention of this).4.  I didn't sink into the ground in open fields at night.5. Squirrels and rabbits didn't sound as though they weighed 20 tonnes ingame, they are the loudest animals when they are running around.6. When you brush against foliage ingame, the sound comes from roughly the same direction of that the foliage is in... otherwise it could be a 20 tonne squirrel.In summary... despite all of the above, this could be a cracking game, what's letting it down at the moment is the shooting side of it.  I had great fun running round and unlocking stuff and doing the odd mission, but as an immersive hunting simulator - forget it.Day 1:It's the Beta, stuck animals, COTW_F crashes and, as an added bonus, if you've been a member of the Hunter for a while, you get the chance to buy, with ingame credits, an extra rifle and ghillie suit... hardly a bonus.I'm so disappointed with myself for falling for it yet again, when will I learn?  Answer... when the first DLC comes out.			"

												I am a fan of thehunter classic and invested a large amount of money into it, so I was eager to play this new game. They have the right idea but honestly it should have never been released in the current state. There are bugs everywhere from clipping through the ground if you go prone, to a graphical glitch with the scope to animals acting in total bizzare ways/ bugging out all together. I regret the purchase. My advice would be don't buy it and wait to see if they actually fix the game. If everyone runs out and buys this it will only encourage the company to release unready games in the future as part of some sort of money grab. If they take pride in their work they will fix these bugs. It looks like the game need another month or two of work on it before it was ready for release. The game may be worth picking up in the future but only if they fix these issues because its unacceptable when I come across several bugs within the first hour of play alone.			"

												In germany we have a saying: ""Der Fisch fängt am Kopf an zu stinken."" which roughly translates to ""the fish rots from the head down"". You can feel that talented and passionate people are working on this game. It´s just a shame that someone decided that the game had to be released in a barely finished state. Overall the gameplay is great but there are quite a lot of litte things and glitches that add up and can be frustrating. From stuck animal herds, to crashes, broken scopes and unresponsive menue buttons you´ll see it all. I really miss a better highscore system or trophy room of some sorts. You have a list with your scores but it´s really basic.   It´s hard to recommend but I still enjoy the game. The two, beautiful maps are huge and the gameplay is for the most part quite solid. The game just feels rough around the edges. Also it is good to see that the developer moved away from the awful free too play model of their previous release.			"

												This one hurts... I was really looking forward to it, but it lets you down hard. It has the potential to be a really good game, but unfortunately it's way too far from finished. For every reason to play, there is, at least for the moment, two not to. I don't even know where to start, but here goes.The bugs... this game is so broken.Disappearing animals, disappearing tracks, the photo missions are a bloody mess (the patch didn't work), sometimes your scope sights work, at other times it just looks like you're looking through a tube on top of your rifle. Over and above that, I've experienced three complete system crashes. Just not good enough. The walking... oh my good gods, the walking.If you're looking for a game that's more of a hiking simulator than anything else, you've come to the right place!Everything is so bloody far away and while you can fast travel between base camps, you still have to discover them. Walking 4km to a mission is not fun - even if you can shoot a few things along the way. This is especially fun when you've walked more than 3km and your game crashes. Giving me an achievement that I've run an ultra marathon doesn't help either. This isn't called The Marathon Runner. Progression... making me work my ♥♥♥ off for something that's worseFirst of all, skill points and perks. Their effects are nominal. You don't actually feel like you've progressed at all. The ability to judge an animal's weight doesn't work, because the developers never really got around to sorting out the whole kg/pound conversion thing just yet. Then, of course, you have to choose whether you want to range your sights, or judge the windage of your shot (the windage often differs significantly from the general wind direction, because, you know, deer farts and stuff). Secondly, the progression of firearms. THIS! I worked my way up to the .338 - they don't say whether it's a .338 Lapua or Winchester. Regardless, both of these cartridges are renowned for their accuracy. Not in this game though. 0 accuracy. 0. Nought. You work your way up to the best (and most expensive) rifle in the game and it can't shoot straight.Lack of contentTwo maps, each with their own animals. But it gets old quickly. The missions are all the same, the amount of weapons are ridiculously small and the ""balancing"" (I presume) between damage and accuracy just means that one is slightly less crappy than the other. Having said all of this, it does have a few good points. The hunting is fun and it'll keep you entertained for a few hours. The game is beautiful - the terrain is awesome and the animal models are pretty good. It seems that the developers are pretty keen to improve it, but I'm extremely disappointed that it was released in this state. This game is not finished and letting people buy it so that they can help you pick out the bugs is total BS (even though it is an often too common thing these days). Again, this has the potential to be a really great game, but for the moment, I'd steer clear.			"

												EDIT TO REVIEW:So I've been watching this game closly and the devs are very very active in fixing and tweaking the game. They've fixed some issues I've expressed below so I now have high hopes for this game. It's not perfect but the patching makes me hopeful. My experience with this game:-Decide to try stalking a deer-Follow closely behind on although never getting to see it because it can hear me crouch walking through foliage made of old sun chip bags-Crouch walking for an hour at least, get acheivement for tracking 50 tracks for one animal-Another hour later finally see deer glitch humping a rock, I could walk up to it and it would keep glitching-Decide that wasn't rewarding so move onto another deer-20 minutes later hear one mating call-Crouched and moved toward it-Rinse repeat 50 or so tracks later I have a clear shot-Aim scope, a third grader could hold it more steady-Decide to try prone, my guy must of grabbed a handful of foliage and duct taped it to from of scope-Take a shot from crouch, headshot-Deer runs away like nothing happened-Figured ""Well it shouldn't take long to bleed out""-Investigate blood splatter ""flesh wound""-Stayed stationary for 10 or so minutes, had cup of coffee-Track blood trail-50 or so blood splatters later decide to let it bleed more-I go to town, shop at the mall, go on real hunting trip, shoot deer in exact spot as on game, it bleeds out within 15, carry deer back to truck, drive home, gut deer, hang meat up, smoke a good amount of it, go to college for 4 years, get married, have kids and realize I left game running, go back to check it-Track 50 more blood splatters, finally find deer-Take another shot, body hit-10 mote blood splatters later finally find deer body, victory-Rifle skill +1-Can't buy anything useful from shop without genociding all deer-Any real hunting equipment you need 40 hours of gameplay to actually get toActual Review:-Weapons: It takes far too long to level up to the point of unlocking a new weapon, and even longer to get the cash for one. It seems like when I earn enough for one weapon I've unlocked the next one and have to choose to earn enough for that one or buy the lower weapon class one. I realize using different weapon classes provides an integrity bonus, for example using a lower calibur bullet on smaller game gets you more cash. I'm not sure if I understand this entirely not being an avid hunter.-Codex: Very bare bones for information. Doesn't quite explain the most important issues like how to use certain equipment and why the highest calibur rifle has an accuracy of 0. Looked for a wikia and didn't find much. But I shouldn't have to use google to have a base understanding of a game.-Callers: Very very useful, almost to a fault. I've been hunting only a few times in the real world and callers have not worked so well for me. It seems like I just sprint through the forest, hear a warning call, use the correct caller and wait. Seems like the other methods of hunting in this game are much more difficult and I find myself using callers to farm money for hours just to buy a new rifle.-Leveling up: Extremely slow leveling progression. I have 35 hours and about 150-200 animals hunted. I'm a total level of 15. Very few skills I can get and very few perks. I understand hunting is a time consuming activity and a simulation should be as realistic as possible, but it seems like grinding levels takes the fun out of it.-Glitching: I've experienced many glitches. I press ESC and it sends me to another reserve, after taking a shot with the perk to stay scoped it shows me down the barrel of the gun instead of scope, serveral several animals are stuck on rocks and trees, [E] Inspect stays until restart of game, certain items requiring 0/0 skill remain locked through entire game, animals remaining upright after death, after coming out of aim it auto spins me 90-180 degrees instantly and animals shot over ~300m don't take off running.It is a beautiful looking game and has a lot of good aspects to it. But the gameplay seems underdeveloped.			"

												Ok，I am from China. BUT want the developer can see my evaluation , I will write in English .  I think we only experience hunting from this game . BUT the hunters life not only hunter , they will be  tired or hungry .  I think this game can divide  into the survival mode and hunting mode .   Someone may just like hunting and have fun can play hunting mode . The other players want to experience whole hunter life  can play survival  mode .  The  cooking and make clothes from animal fur may give players more sence of achievement .It's a good game , it's make me quiet  by  call of the wild .			"

												Update after 60+ hours:I decided to quit the game for now, it is simply unfinished, too many issues. For many people, including myself, the game randomly freezes which is equal to crash. Two weeks passed, 4 patches came out, but this issue have never been adressed. I've had enough. Yesterday I  returned to the store GTX1080, which I bought specially for this game. I was hoping to enjoy it as long as the original game. But it is very far from enjoyable. I mean, in 4K it looks stunning, easly the most beautiful game I've seen. However, after the excitement of graphics faded, there was nothing left that would have forced me to play. I'm not even talking unique antlers, leaderboards and competitions, you better forget about it. I mean everything in the game is unfinished or broken. Weapons, callers, animal AI, sounds, menus, descriprions, every aspect of the game works wrong. And this is a very serious obstacle to immersion and fun. A few patches that are released, do not fix anything. I know these developers since classic. You can ask them for months to fix autoreloading... Here is a new game, and again the same problem! 7mm/.338 auto-reloading after each shot, not allowing me to follow wounded animal with sights.  Deer bleat caller has slow-motion behaviour, and is imossible to switch to another item. While jackrabbit caller for some reason can be interrupted instanlty, but the sound continues to play. Map is terrible and slow loading, focusing at random point instead of player. Waypoint doens't work. Even when you need to mark a spot you standing at, it's impossible to do. Weapon and ammo descriptions lie, penetration/expansion is mixed up. Another insult to common sense: 45-70 caliber in this game is so weak, it's the same as .243,  both ammo are class 2. Animals follow calls like a zombies. I made a video shooting deer with an bow, they all come back to call in a minute, even wounded ones! I can go on forever....I know most of this issues will be fixed in a couple of years. But I'm not going to wait this time.EW_Anna, this is all just words, the fact is that you released a poor quality product that should not be allowed to Steam. When the game started to freeze every 5 minutes, I asked for refund, which was declined. You all knew the game is unfinished, full of bugs and not tested properly... I can't respect decisions like this._____________________________________________________________Original review:Extremely bugged and bad optimization(GTX980 1440p 40fps). The game wouldn't save some settings after restart. Have to click 60 times to decrease mouse sensitivity from 80 to 20, why there is no SLIDER?! Still mouse moves too fast, and the game resets setting for me every time! Sometimes it's impossible to exit in-game menu (only to desktop), pressing the button does nothing. Once I lost the progress on the map, and so on.. Considering return because of that.Graphics look good, especially close vegetaion and foliage. But on the distance not very impressive. Reminds me the same old classic hunter, which I have played for more than 1000 hours total..I disabled all arcade elements I could. Still there are signs and pointers flying everywhere. The game is very easy, the main goal is to kill everything that moves(or stuck). In the classic game I enjoyed walking a long distances through beautiful environments, searching for a monster buck, trying to avoid other animals, almost never shot does and small bucks. There was a leaderboard, daily events, personal galleries, trophyshots, and we could discuss our trophies, and so on. For me this was the main point of the game. It was fully focused on quality, not quantity. Here we have another story - kill 'em all, this is how you get xp and money to unlock unlocks, so you can unlock more unlocks even faster. All antlers look the same, there are no unique racks, no scoring system, no trophyshots, no reason to play after everything has been unlocked. I'm not interested in just shooting the same animals over and over again, when there is nothing to discover.Wouldn't recommend at this point, at least because of bugs. As for the gameplay - may be they will improve it later, but I doubt it.			"

												As a hunter that hunts in Louisiana and Mississippi this game does an amazing job at giving off the vibe of hunting, but it needs a lot more things added to it. I was pretty disappointed in seeing that the game did not have the REMINGTON R-15, SAS Rage bow, or the Taurus Raging Bull... Seeing that the devs launched what they call a ""full released game""  instead of an ""early acess game"" i find it hard to believe they will add a lot more new things into the game (PROVE ME WRONG DEVS).. Really enjoying the game but the 30 bucks it needs more things in game. The game sounds are SPOT On and done very well. Some minor bugs, but nothing to gamebreaking. I give it a 7/10 for now. LETS HOPE THEY DONT GO HUNTER PRIMAL ON US AGAIN!Pros-2 Big maps that take place in 2 different PLACES-Single player game follows multiplayer gameplay aswell-Fast travel system -ieach district of the map, you'll have 1 or 2 spots in which has some type of hunting stand in which you can build an assemble.- Little collectibles hiding around the world-Outpost in which you can buy ammo, scents, callers,guns, and clothing-Scoring system for the animal you killCons-Game store does not sell any kind of feed causing you to explore the world to discover a feeding spot that the animals go to.-Cant climb the ladders -Game has no tree stands-cannot deploy your own stands nor buy your own stands  (The game has pre built foundations for you to build in certain parts of the map)-Scents, callers, guns, and clothing are TOO OVERPRICED-No Vehicles???? Atleast give us ATVS-Can only have 1 profile on game-Lack of firearms inlcuding bows, rifles, pistols, and shotguns-NO Crossbows AT all-No turkeys, No Alligator, No Mountain Lions to hunt			"

												I have to say that this is perhaps one of the most beautiful games I've ever played. The scenery and the level of detail from terrain to lighting effects is amazing. I am running it on maximum setting. Visuals are absolutely stunning. There are couple of things I'd like to see addressed: 1. Addition of a vehicle would be welcome. The area is expansive and talking simply takes too long to get from one area to another. Of course, the point of the game is to walk the vast terrain, to observe the pray and scout locations. It's a simulator in the true sense of that word. But having a vehicle to quicly reach a hunting area would be great. Yes, there are check points with fast travel, but it's not enough. 2. Walking noise could be improved. You have to move very very slowly to avoid making noise. That's also a very realisting idea but taken a little too far in my opinion. 3. Tracking animals is unreliable. At times the track simply stops as if the animal was abducted by aliens. At other times it reaches a point where it goes in a circle. It's a little frustrating when you track game for a good while only to reach a dead end. 4. Some bugs. Although the developer seems to be very engaged. It's a minor problem at this point. No crashes or anything. Just weird visuals. Once I shot a fox that was standing next to another fox and the second animal didn't even move. Just stood there. I could walk up to it and shoot it point blank. Odd. Unless he ""froze"" on purpose which I doubt. Overall, very unique experience. Visually stunning. First hunting game I bought. It really is great and I would recommend it. Happy Hunting!			"

												Don´t buy it just yet. It has still the same bugs as in the closed Beta and the game runs horrible on an up-to-date highend machine. When your game crashes just because you go into the menu you know the game had no quality control at all and people already reported this stuff in the Beta. I will change this review when those bugs are fixed. But until now safe your money, since this game is not playable at all. There are early access titles on Steam which run better and they claim to be an Alpha while this piece of junk here is a full release.Edit: Managed to play the game with lower resolution. Then it´s not crashing in the menus and runs fine. It seems to have a fundamental problem with 4K. Besides that I encountered several bugs within 10 Minutes of gameplay. Animals who are stuck or have an AI Error seem to be normal. Have a look for yourself, i found those animals who got stuck and I am using the vanilla version of the game without any tweaks. http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/80340029170473272/191B82F70B8DECECE8F02BD5E88E89C6B8F1EFBF/http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/80340029170472927/744691DE65F8235912E1489D4FE6D4A4EA41CB17/This, the broken menu, the tiny content and the simple but broken AI shouldn´t be in a full release like this. It´s not even branded as an early access title but has more bugs than most of them.			"

												It's hard to give this game a thumbs down. There's a lot to love, but there are also an unacceptable amount of bugs and some missing features (fowl hunting, mobile outpost, equipment variety). Now that they announced the development of versions for PS4 and XBone, PC gamers are concerned how dedicated EW will be to fixing their broken product. They claim they won't give up on us, but only time will tell.			"

												The game itself is absoloutely amazing and breathtaking, and if it worked correctly it would definitely be worth $30, however, it is so buggy that its almost impossible for alot of players to play.I have never in my history of playing almost exclusively early access games seen a game so buggy, and this game is considered full release. SLI isnt working properly, and going into 4k causes mem leaks and crashes, that and there isnt a way to go back to main menu from the game that i can see without exiting the game. There are tons of other bugs, wait till they iron them out before you purchase because this developer is kinda notorious for leaving things unfinished (looking at the hunter primal).			"

												Give it a chance, I actually refunded this after 2 hours but something drew me right back.I have played just about every hunting game since the mid 90's and out of all those games, this has the magic of some of the very best. (BTW - you can disable most HUD popups and the ""Deer icons"" are only tutorial, don't be like me and think it was a full time feature!)For an ""Arcadey theHunter"" - as many (included myself) branded it - it certainly does not feel like it when you dig deep. It is not a shooting gallery, dont expect deer to just wander past you - in some aspects its even more realistic than Classic.For example -- View distance is FINALLY increased meaning that looking into the distance is actually important now.- Night hunts - call them unethical all you want, but get out there with your headtorch under the stars, the moonlight glowing on the ground and the beautiful sounds of owls hooting in the distance makes it an unforgetable experience. I actually prefer to hunt during this time.- Animals actually have a more believable routine (Wild boar are rarely seen  out in the open during the day, only venturing out after dusk etc) You also have feeding spots and bedding areas which they return to.- Graphics - wow - honestly I cannot work out how some people have slated the graphics as merely ""OK"" because the visuals are simply mind blowing at 4k on ultra. It is so inviting you actually want to explore the (HUGE) map. Walking speed also feels more realistic and not just a geriatric shuffle.- The little things - bushes actually make noise now so it effects how you stalk your prey. The grass becomed flattened behind you and animals, leaving a very realistic looking path. An IN GAME mission journal. The majority of threatened animals can harm you if cornered. Animal tracks last longer than a few hours. The sounds are beautiful, the animations are fluid and there is ample map to explore and discover.One of the best things is the sense of progression this game gives you. You do not start with all the gear, you have to unlock it with ingame money and levelups so there is an actual goal to play towards. The downsides are - - Generic deer antlers - I can only hope the devs listen to the pleas of fans and change this.- Some optimization issues for some but they said from the start, this is a HIGH QUALITY game - do not expect older machines to max it out.It is far from pefect, needs a bit of polish and bug fixes but my god, its a fun game. Whine all you want about it ""not being a finished game"" - while it may not have the amount of animals or the sophisticated TruRACS system, its certainly giving me alot more enjoyment than classic ever did.

												**This Review has been Updated****Update: Since the update, I have noticed that the small animals(ie, rabbits and squirrels) are no longer wearing rain jackets, and thus no longer sound like they are running through empty bags of Doritos. However, when tracking a moose that I shot, I completely lost the blood trail randomly. I don't know if this is a new feature or what, but the moose circled around in the area of an old trail, and while I found plenty of tracks, I found no more blood trail which is key to finding a wounded animal and keeping on the right track. That could have been an issue on my end, I suppose, and I'll have to look into this a bit more in order to determine if this is some sort of bug. Also, it is obvious that the crouch-walking works better now in this new update, and you get spotted less frequently when you are crouched and moving. On the downside though, you walk painfully slower when traveling this way. But I suppose that's supposed to be realistic, so that's fair.**Is it worth buying at this point? That's for you to decide. There are both positives and negatives about the current state of this game, keep reading. Starting with the Positives about the game: The settings are great. From the visuals in the scenery, to the audio with raindrops and the wind blowing through the leaves, the background really is pretty stunning. You don't have a wide variety of animals to shoot at this point, but those that you can they look very well done. The animals also sound really good, and often behave like wild animals. If you don't get good shot placement, you can very much rely on having to track a wounded animal for some time until you can either finally put it down, or it eventually succumbs to it's injuries. The little stories in singleplayer and missions are also pretty neat. And on to the Negatives: Why do the squirrels and rabbits sound like they are wearing little little rainjackets when they run around? While the game animals sound fairly normal as they walk through the grass and brush, the smaller critters sound like they are wearing plastic as they romp about the trees and meadows. Nothing breaks the immersion as you're sighting in on a large buck as you suddenly hear a pair of squirrels wearing windsuits dashing about the boulder you've perched on to take your shot. And as you suddenly look around to see what is going on around you, your buck notices the movement and shoots off like a rocket into the safety of the forest as you silently curse the creators of these squirrels. Also, at random times, the game suddenly decides that it's done playing nice. And your leisurely stroll through the meadow as you search for a black bear takes a sudden turn as you notice that you are now walking in slow motion. So you switch for your tracker to a rifle so you can walk a bit faster for a bit, but soon you're still forced to a virtual crawl as your walk becomes visibly slower. And so you have to restart the game. Sometimes, you come across an animal that is stuck in some way. Sometimes it is stuck between a tree and a rock, for example. At other times, it's stuck in a loop, walking or running in a sort of circle. And so you fire a shot at the stuck animal. Sometimes you'll kill it. Sometimes you'll just scare it, and it will run faster even though it's still stuck. Now and again, it'll take one hit, but it won't kill it, even though it just runs faster and faster and as you shoot at it over and over again-at times you'll see the shot take effect and it stumbles to the ground-it'll get back up and refuse to die. And you'll have to restart the game because you're never going to kill it. Sometimes you'll shoot a stuck animal, and no matter how point-blank you shoot it, the bullets magically fail to hit their intended target. Other times you'll clearly and visibly hit the animal, and it'll eventually run off. But when you come up to find the blood trail, you'll see that there is no blood. Even though the animal clearly fell the ground and got back up to run away, there's no blood. You may have hit it three or four times, and there's no blood trail. And when you eventually give up, you suddenly notice that you don't see animal tracks anymore, and if you fire a shot at something, it magically misses(although it does expend ammo). Sometimes this can be fixed by fast traveling to an outpost. You might think that the negatives outweigh the positives. Or vice versa. And that's up to you decide. For me, even though the game is currently frustrating at it's present state, I still enjoy it. The visuals are well-done, the animal movements are excellent, etc. But it's also frustrating and a little buggy. The immersion breaks at points(especially when you or a small animal moves through the brush and grass), the game crawls at times, and you sometimes can't hit what your aiming at even if you could literally touch the animal you're shooting at. Would I recommend this game? Yes, with the caveats that this game is currently buggy, but I do believe that the developers will get it fixed. The makers of this game have done well with other games in the theHunter line, and there's no reason to think they won't get these problems fixed. For that reason, I do recommend this game.			"

												tl;dr  I like it, but it is a $30 USD Open Beta at the moment.The things that work in the game are good.  It feels a lot like theHunter Classic from several years back, but without subscription fees. That's the best thing about the game.  There's more here at launch than the Classic game had at launch, which is also a plus.The problem is that it is absolutely riddled with bugs, poor design decisions, and a lack of certain features which made the Classic game fun to play for so many years.  It easily could have used another 6 months to a year of development before release. Or at the very least, released it as an Early Access game, because that's essentially what it is at this point in time. The Good:  1. The hunting is great.  Aside from a few bugs and other minor annoyances.2. Graphics are really nice.  Easy to immerse yourself in the world. 3. No subscription fee. I've been waiting for a subscription-less Hunter ever since the Classic game released.4. No microtransactions or other real money purchases. All the weapons and equipment are able to be bought in game without having to pay real money for them.5. Xbox One controller support.  Seriously this is great. With as much walking and creeping around that you have to do, it's nice to just use the controller and sit back relaxed.  And you can still use the mouse to shoot if you want. I've been using the controller to move, and the mouse for precision shooting. 6. The game is self-contained. No more having to go to theHunter website to setup your hunt and launch. The Bad:1. Bugs. Bugs everywhere.  From sounds not being played, to hunting structures not allowing you to build them, to animals getting stuck in the scenery, it is absolutely riddled with bugs. 2. Progression system feels poorly designed.   It takes forever to acquire enough ""experience"" to unlock new weapons and gear.  13 hours into the release version, I'm level 9 and have unlocked 1 gun, a bullet type, and maybe a caller?  The perks and skills system could use a reworking as well.   Apparently at least one perk doesn't seem to work for anyone.3. No global leaderboards or competitions.  What's the point of harvesting a great trophy animal, if you can't see where it ranks compared to other people, or enter it into a competition? The competitions are one thing that really gave the Classic Hunter such longevity. 4. The missions.  One of the first missions you get is to ""photograph"" a deer for a woman's book.  I want to hunt, not take screenshots. Adding to the frustration is that it seems like you have to do this in a very specific area, and at a very specific distance from the deer. Apparently you get more photography missions later, that get even more specific.  Maybe this could have been more fun if they actually modeled the camera like a real world DSLR set up for wildlife shooting. Instead the game's camera is basically the HUD removed, and replaced with a grid. No zoom controls that I could see.  So basically your smart phone from 5 years ago had more features in the camera than this one.I'm pretty much ignoring the missions right now unless I accidentally trigger one.Could be Better:1. A lot of things could use a bit of rework or tweaking.  One thing I'd like to see added is more fast travel options. If I build a hunting stand somewhere, I'd like the option of fast traveling to it like you can do with the outposts. If the devs don't abandon the game, and continue working on it, it has a lot of potential.  I mostly like what is here now, and I could potentially spend a lot of time with this game.  It wouldn't take a lot to flip the thumbs down to a thumbs up. Mostly fix the glaring bugs and maybe tweak a few of the systems in game. That's not asking much.  I just have a hard time fully recommending the game in its current state.			"

												Ok I dont normally write reviews but for this one I felt I had too based on others negative comments as I nearly didnt buy this game as a result of those negative reviews...If your like me and you always read reviews before buying a game and are normally put off by negative comments about system performance but accept that a new game will always have some bugs then this is aimed at you.I run an I7 6700K 16GB 980TI and have no issues running this game at max settings.The visuals and sounds of this game are simply great and the size of the open world is huge. If your worried about those saying you spend a lot of time walking about doing nothing, yes you will spend a lot of time walking around trying to find animals only to never find them as they see \ hear you coming before you see them and scare them off. Or you find the animal your tracking it sees you and then runs off... But isnt that the point... Its a hunting game its about tracking and not being seen, its about a slow methodical approach, its not supposed to be easy and if it was we would all moan and say its too easy and arcady...In summary I would say you need patience to play this game, practice to get better and yes a few bugs to be patched by the developer. But while your doing all that you will be walking through lush amazing enviroments thinking wow the grass and trees actually move with the wind in the right direction and I need to pick my path so I dont get heard stomping around unlike other games.As for bugs I have encountered three so far:(1) GAME DOESNT ALWAYS LET YOU LEAVE A MENU WITH ESC LIKE YOU SHOULD. For this I found choosing another menu topic and then hitting ESC works fine.(2) MAIN MAP GOES FUNKY OR DOES NOT START CENTERED ON YOU. For this I simply zoom out then back in again or exit and re-enter main map and it is fine then.(3) DIFFICULTING SWITCHING WEAPONS & ITEMS FROM STORAGE TO BACKPACK. By far the biggest bug I have found and only way to resolve is keep entering and exiting storage until it will let you select and drag an item to your back pack and only do one item at a time before exiting and coming back. THIS IS STILL NOT A GAME BREAKER.....			"

												I've refunded the game for now, I will repurchase it once the issues I currently have with it are addressed.- No bullet entry/exit wounds ""I'm speaking of dynamic decals"".- Unrealistic bullet penetration, bullets cannot even penetrate the neck of a small deer not mentioning torso shots.- No bullet impacts on any material, also known as splash ""useful for seeing how far you missed your target"".- Performance isn't the greatest 55 fps average on a gtx 980ti msi 6g OC edition and overclocked i5 to 4.2ghz.- Cannot get points for shooting rabbit/birds with shotguns. - No ability to zero your rifle.- Animals do not seem to interact with each other.- Animal AI bugs out making animals run in circles. - Automatic bolt cycling ""It should be set so you have to manually manipulate the bolt to cycle the action"".- Tracking on the map is very buggy. - Animals are capable of running very far distances even though they are seriously wounded and catch some amazing speeds considering their condition.- No ability to change the walking speed to aid in sneaking ""developers check out the system escape from tarkov have implemented into their game, it would be IDEAL for this game, no seriously check it out"".Now to the things I do like about the game.- Amazing audio.- The graphics are very very nice indeed however they start to lack at a distance and leave a lot to be desired in contrast to the up close visuals, up close is truly gorgeous besides the floating rocks.- A decent selection of weapons but something that should be expanded upon.- The weapons feel very nice compared to thehunter: primal.

												The Game is really cool and fun, im not sure if there is an option to put out your own blinds and feeders, it would be really awesome if there is an option to do so. THe graphics are great, the framrate has micro stuttes for me, but im getting constant 60 fps, ultra 1080p with my gtx 1070 and my i7 6700. I wish they would add a vehicle like a atv or utv to make getting around easy and fun. This is the most impresive hunting game i have ever played and really excited about the potential, these devs really know how to make a good sim hunting game. I would definetly recomened geting this game if you are at all interested in hunting/fishing, amaizing experience all around. This is my very early thoughts of the game as time goes on i will most likely write another, im new to ""The Hunter"" games i dindnt pick up the f2p classic because of the micro dlc, i love the one time pay.

												The Hunter was and is still the most realistic hunting sim with the release of Call of the Wild. You can start in one of the two gigantuous reserves, in the 2 hours I've played so far I've just seen a very small part of it. The whole game is about waiting for that right moment to take your shot and is very zen like to play overall, since you have such beautifull surroundings.I was really hyped when I saw the upgrade in the graphics compartment and even more important NO MORE LICENSES!!Where is this review coming from you wonder, well I used to play the original and really enjoyed it with many hundreds of hours. Don't be alarmed by all the negative reviews, since the game is still under development. The game is surely no arcade shooter do not be silly everyone, the ingame helpers are great for newer hunters and can be turned off accordingly under the gameplay menu.For 30 euros you cannot go wrong here, since you have full access to all the species and stuff you need to hunt them. 9/10			"

												This game has a lot of bugs, needs serious polish, and feels like a beta.  That being said, this is the 1st decent hunting game released since theHunter, the market doesn't really have any competition.  Cabelas, hunting unlimited and games like that are too casual to be taken seriously.  This game has potential, its still fun even with all the bugs.  If your a nut for hunting games like I am this game is for you.  If you don't like hunting games, or like arcade hunting games, this isn't for you so don't buy it.			"

												An early game review:So i think most people reviewing this negatively are being way dramatic about the state of the game. It's a bit buggy but it's nothing that cant be fixed with a good few patches.This game is one of the most beautiful games out there right now, runs fine for me personally, quite well really.Points starting from bad to good:- Yeah there are bugs, for sure. Menu buggitude, people sayin bears are bugged a bit too. And whenever i would harvest an animal my game settings would get reset. Im hopeful these things can get fixed pretty easily tho. As far as stuck animals go, as a game developer, problems like this can be really difficult to solve and are common in a ton of games. I think they should maybe look into it but im not going to blame them too hard if i see the occasional stuck animal. i only encountered one stuck animal in my play time and it was just a dinky rabbit.Edit: After some more time i have noticed a few more stuck animals which is unfortunate but not game breaking really, id say youd end up seeing one stuck animal per 2 hours or so of gameplay. Some more bugs as well such as scope clipping and bugged animation on scope zoom, some fps drops wen tracking animals long distances using the phone thing, and game freezing occasionally, sometimes recovering other times not. - Some people talking about the game being too easy and too many animals but id like to know what game they were playing because for me, trying to get a good shot and then not being able to and spooking the animals and then having to track em down for like an hour without seeing anything,, i dont think the game was too overflowing with animals. However there are a lot more animal calls sometimes it seems, which i think is fine and turning off the audio visualzation is good idea as well.Edit - A little more detail on this: Sometimes there can definitely be quite a few animal calls, a lot more than were in theHunter classic. Personally i dont really have a problem with this as they are just calls, and they arent distracting if you have the vocal visualizations off. While running around you are likely to never actually see any of the animals calling unless you run into a field where there may be a few animals grazing (but this doesnt feel unrealistic to me at least) but it does hark on to my point about sound where animal calls are louder than they should be really. Maybe putting the calls on a seperate audio slider or something. Its also important to NOTE: if you hunt out an area and scare off animals its totally quiet out there. So in all, i still dont feel there are ""too many"" animals as the likelyhood of encountering one is not astronomically high or anything.- I've seen some people say its lacking content? But from what i can tell the maps are huuge and vary pretty good in the areas and there are a fair number of animals to hunt right now, as well as a fair amount of weaponry. The game is not like a full price AAA release, its half that in fact, and, if you were to compare it to theHunter classic, this game is a bargain. If you wanted to do any of the stuff in this game in classic youd be paying for a membership and paying real money like $5 per weapon. The game has plenty of content for $30 with more to come in dlcs. -This game however, does not have a lot of the features that classic has in terms of competitions and leaderboards and community. I think this is intentional and likely to stay that way. Both games serve a purpose, and the purpose of this game is not to be exactly like the last one, but a more standalone experience not tied down to microtransactions and a separate launcher with community stuff and accounts and all that jazz. This may turn some of the more hardcore hunters off, and if it does, then i dont think this game is for you.- Does not have free look to detach look direction from walk direction. That would be a veryyy nice thing to have and i dont know why it isnt in already.- Uses a progression tree in terms of weapon perks and various skills. This is a highly subjective way of doing it but i think it is a fine way to do it. I dont think its anything special and is highly debatable but i dont think it should be a turn off. It just allows for progression of the game and your character, which by the way, theres just about no character choice options... this easily seems like one of the most underdeveloped things. but eh.- Sound is very immersive and well realized. Ive seen some people complain about the sound being bad somehow but this is crazy talk if you ask me. Maybe im just not hardcore enough of a hunter to really understand but i think some people are just babies.Edit: while i still think sound is very good, some things ive noticed after more time are music cutting out randomly, bear calls being cut short, and sounds of russling and animal calls being a bit too loud.- A quick graphics review: The game is gorgeous. Hands down the best nature ive ever seen in a game. If i had to gripe about graphics at all as a hardcore graphics enthusiast, shadows are pretty blocky, but they can get away with this because there is a ton of foliage to break up the shadows so that you wont notice unless you reeallyyy look at them. Still a higher res shadow option could be nice, but i think they used resources freed by using lower quality shadows for more impactful features elsewhere. The clouds if you look at them too hard are obviously just moving textures in the sky but whatever really the game is about nature not clouds and they look pretty good when not viewed under scrutiny. Water reflections are a bit low res.. i know reflections can be intense but at least an option for some higher quality reflections would be nice. Also about reflections, and this can be an issue with water effects in a lot of games, around edges of objects where water is in the background there is a weird halo around them, not a super big deal but very noticable. No option for anti aliasing??? this is a weird one but i guess there is AA applied somewhere at least, maybe tied to quality setting, but not cool at any rate. That being said, i havent really had any issues with aliasing, its not a jag fest like some games are. And you would think this would be too with all the foliage. And don't even get me started on the foliage, its so dense and detailed and even reacts to animals and players to the point where animals leave paths through the grass as they walk, easily the best foliage ive ever seen in a game. Overall, Beautiful game.I think that covers most things.Conclusion:The game is pretty good for the price. A must have if you like walking simulation and hunting experiences.Perhaps hold off for a month or two until some of the more glaring bugs and finicky-ness is sorted out if that kind of thing bothers you.

												I so badly want to give this game a good review but in it's current state I can't.  At first everything was great, but the longer i've played, and then stepped into multiplayer, the amount of bugs, gamebreaking bugs is staggering.  Its almost as if the 90% of the development time went into making the game look pretty (and it does).For one, deer can very easily get stuck or spawn being stuck.  Out of the 12 deer I have found 4 have spawned into an object making them a free kill, and 2 have wandered into a wall or rock making an easy kill.  The animations are equally bad, there is many times where animals are doing their moving animation when they are standing completely still, it just looks really ... out of place when you see an animal moonwalking.  They can also be quite dumb and not even notice you shooting at them.When you enter the systems menu it says press ESC to quit but you can't, it doesnt work, you have to click on options again to re-enter options to escape.  On the main map the waypoint you can place down is invisible on your huntermate (and completely invisible in multiplayer to everyone else) and doesn't show up till your very close to it.  You can't exit back to the main menu (to join multi) you instead  have to completely quit the game (same with switching from multiplayer to single) ...Then into multiplayer where is when more bugs appeared.  One of my friends for literally no reason moves at slower then everyone else when we do the same thing (has nothing to do with weight, he is a starter character too).  You can't join friends game as you spawn under the world when you try to join from friends.  You can't unlock any locations or waypoints or outposts in another persons game (only the host can).  Sometimes there is large dysync issues between the animals.  The textures and animations for player models are all over the place its hilarious at times, one of the characters shoe textures are linked. Switching from bow to rifle causes your rifle to be unable to zoom in on your rifle so you have to relog to fix it, making it impossible to use your bow and rifle at the same time.Like I can go on and on, this is stuff that shouldn't even pass alpha yet it made it into release, its extremely troublesom that a company cares SO little about its product its willing to release it in this buggy and unfinished state so mass amount of people will return and downvote the game ... what the hell were you guys thinkingI will still play this game because I am enjoying it, but I am downvoting it because you should avoid this buggy mess till its fixed (and i'll change my review then)			"

												Great game, but it has more bugs than dayz did 2 years ago. A lot of which are pretty game breaking, making the game feel very incomplete. I cant say how many times my game has crashed after spending a good chunk of time trying to bag a nice bull moose and then seeing it dead, game crashes.			"

												So in it's current state I can not recommend  theHunter: Call of the Wild™. Right now the game is a bug-ridden mess with terrible UI. The whole experience has a very early access feel to it.Other than that the graphics and the scenary are really pretty. But that shouldn't be the reason for a purchase.I say just wait for now and don't buy. Wait few weeks. Maybe by that time the game is going to be patched and some of the nasty game breaking bugs will be fixed.			"

theHunter: Call of the WildGameplayIt needs to be out of the way first, theHunter: Call of the Wild is about hunting wildlife. If you are okay with that, then the game is going to be pretty much what you expected. I played the original Hunter quite a while back and I was not able to get into it for some reason. theHunter: Call of the Wild seems much more streamlined than the previous game which was pretty inviting for me as well as new player to the series. theHunter: Call of the Wild puts you in the boots of a Hunter in a huge open world with the prospect of hunting virtual wildlife. That is pretty much all the story that is present in the game, because even after the narrator telling you a few lines and giving you some quests, it is pretty vague. Do not go in expecting a brilliant narrative adventure out of this game. Now, how does the actual hunting holds up.For the most part, the hunting in theHunter: Call of the Wild is pretty solid. You get all kinds of tools at your disposal to hunt down the surprising less diverse wildlife. From noise maker to sprays to attract your prey towards a location and then putting a bullet through their lungs, that is the game. theHunter: Call of the Wild does falter in the skill tree it uses to unlock all these fancy tools and you really need to grind your way by murdering quite a lot of fauna.  This requires a lot of patience and time and might frustrate some players. You can unlock Far Cry 3 like towers which show you points of interests on that particular part of the map. The gun recoils are nice and feel quite good to use.Don’t expect to go in all bullet blazing though like a Call of Duty game. theHunter: Call of the Wild requires you to be patient and wait for the creature to be at a perfect position when you take the shot. The animal can even run away wounded and you will have to follow its blood trail to track and hunt it down. theHunter: Call of the Wild is at its best in these moments, I remember trailing a rare bear for some time following a blood trail it left and finally catching it a water body it came near to drink. It keeps you immersed in these moments and truly feels like something special. The wildlife is also very quick to react and they make the world a living breathing one. But in theHunter: Call of the Wild you’re basically like a god. It is nigh impossible for a creature to kill you unless you stand right in front of a bear. Even the fall damage from a high outpost isn’t enough to actually kill you. I felt bad for these poor creatures who were just waiting to be preyed upon. There is no food requirement, nothing that can force you to tense up. You can go hunting in the night and there will be literally no other danger. While there is plenty of wildlife to hunt, the diversity is pretty low. More often than not you will run into yet another bear or deer and it gets very repetitive after a while. You also have to walk a lot which is expected but it won’t please most of the audience. It is not helped by the fact that theHunter: Call of the Wild is extremely buggy. I can’t recall how many times a creature clipped through the trees, my bullets just whizzed past the animal’s lungs without hurting it and the constant crashes are enough the annoy anyone out of their wits. While the multiplayer works fine when playing with friends, it seems that this game is not really made for it. Too many hunters spoil a game and it is very much true here. VisualsVisually theHunter: Call of the Wild looks stunning. From the god rays of the sun to the gentle breeze flowing through the forest, it is one of the prettiest games I’ve played. The animal models are also really stunning and the game just takes your breath away quite some times with the beautiful vistas it presents. There is a fair amount of visual pop in and there are some really hilarious visual glitches which might break your immersion sometimes but overall it is pretty beautiful. What is a letdown though are the human models in multiplayer. They look like someone put a bunch of dolls in a jungle and that does help the game.SoundExcellent. From the animals sounds to just the rain pattering on the leaves, everything is done beautifully. The only trouble is when you walk through a water body which is when your shoes make more sounds than a bear who is ready to mate. But overall it has an excellent sound package.OverallI can’t help but like theHunter: Call of the Wild. It has its problems and it does certainly feel like an early access game but if you want a proper hunting game, theHunter: Call of the Wild should be your choice. It needs some polish and more content but as it stands, it is a solid hunting game which sports outstanding visuals and excellent sound design. It is not for everyone though and you should keep that in mind if you are purchasing this game.

												It has the most beautiful forest I have seen in a game yet.Multiplayer works pretty well (2 players).Walking trough the forest feels AMAZING. Not only the graphics, lightning and weather effects but also the bushes trees and grass, which react to your and the animals movement. Hell, I could play this game just walking around in the beatiful environment. In high grass you can clearly see where you or animals have traveled, as a path will be visible. The sounds of the animals are spot on as well. If you turn off all the help such as highlighting of spotted animals or trails, the immersion is pretty good. However, there are some bugs, for example the attacking animation of european bisons seems to be a bit broken. Some time the multiplayer might crash as well (I had one akward moment where i coulden't see any more prey or animals downed by the other player but bloodtains and stuff were visible, or one time where the headlight went on and i coulden't switch it off). And in multiplayer its seems like only the host can discover places and build stuff. They will be marked for the other player in his session but he cant get XP from them or fast travel to newly disovered huts, only when he visits those locations in his self hosted games he can that.Still, the immersion, the graphics and the gameplay feel spot on and I can only recoomend this games to players who enjoy the tension of searching for a target and don't mind spending much time walking in a beautiful virtual environment.Sure there are some bugs but restarting the game always helps and within the 14 h playtime on clock they diden't happen that frequently (maybe 4 restarts needed and 1 crash). Which I can forgive as they still continue working on the game.			"

												The game is in BETA status atm. I would like to give a neutral rating if that would be possible. I had and have fun with the game, but there are tons of bugs and problems atm. On the other side this game has so much potential. If u like the Hunter and hunting aka slow paced gameplay overall and have a good pc and can live with a not perfect game you can buy it, especially its not expensive. The Devs can turn this into a Hunter Primal 2.0 Fail Game or they can make the best Hunting game out there. Lets see and hope the second thing happens. "

												Its very ovious now why so few was allowed to beta this game.  But as it goes with these companies is... Why have a Beta and release the game with nothing done to the bugs that was reported?? How is it... You can be walking around hunting and all of a sudden your Rifle just leaves your inventory?? Sound quits for no reason.  Game loads with no sound. Game loads but forgets the Resolution you had set for the game.The folks whom bought the game here on Steam have the option to get a refund before 2 hours played. Others whom got it from Amazon are stuck with a half full glass of dirty water. approached as a cash grab and hope it all gets forgotten.			"

												with a price tag on this game, i cant recommend it as it is now. its is wayyyyyy ""early access"".problems i have been facing in the 8 hours i have played:1)Randomly, after opening and closing the map everything becomes sluggish and wont return to normal unless i pull out the GPS and put it away, not everytime, but still. also, you have the option to place a marker on the GPS map, but nowhere on your HUD does it display the marker, not on your compas or on your gps handheld, so everytime you want to make sure you are still heading in the right direction, you have to open the full page map and check. this is why the sluggish bug is annoying, because you are constantly opening and closing the map.2) invincible animals. I have put multiple rounds into multiples animals and they wont die. I mean, 6+ shots into the vital region of a moose with no effect. a straight up vital shot on a bear, it charged me, stopped and sat down after clawing me, shot it in the head (not joking) and it ran off and procceded to waste over 45 minutes scouting a blood trail until giving up. this is beyond frustrating. I do not know how the mechanics work of an animals health and vital regions, but they are clearly broken. a white tail deer cant be gut shoted 4 times and simply walk it off.3) killed animals dissapear before i can claim them. I have had multiple times were i succesfully dropped a target at a great distance and it took me so long to walk to where i shot it it wasnt there. mutliple times. kill a deer, bear, moose, elk.... spend over 30 minutes REAL TIME walking to it (was on other side of massive lake) for it to not be there.4) weather makes no sense, had a thunder storm with clear skies. constant fog off on all day. rain with clear skies. yes hunting season (fall) can have crazy weather, but not every damn day is a storm of the ages. tune it back a bit please, or give us the option to turn off weather effects5) store inventory is weird and buggy. no notification of a transcation. just asks ""are you sure"" gives yes or no option, but the yes or no option stays up if you click yes and nothing tells you a purchase was made.6) there are still mechanics in this game from when it was the free-to-play. you can rest at a cabin to fast forward time, it has a cooldown if you use it often, but has option to spend cash to override it, didnt remove any of my game currency when i used it, so i think its still left over from f2p. this might also be why the marketplace is all goofy, still havent transitioned over from their microtransactions.7) some of the ""immortal"" animals"" show back up dead after a fast travel. but its beyond annoying. a huge part of the game is tracking, when you claim an animal it removes all the tracks and blood spots of that animal. but witht eh above problems it makes tracking a shot animal impossible. you have an entire traits tree you can invest in for it, but with no animals dying when shot, or disappearing, it leaves massive amounts of previous tracks and blood trails that constaly overlap fresh game trails, ruining the game.8) guns haveing confusing stats. i hunt, so i have some knowledge about calibers and which you would use for what, but i doubt everyone who buys this game does, and the stats for rifles dont really have a ""firepower"" category for the less gun savy people. or atleast a ""recommended use for the following animals: x,y,z"". and with how grindy this game is to unlock and purchase guns, it sort of needs that to avoid wasted purchases and just user friendly UI9) all animals are the same model, there are no ""big"" or ""small"" bucks, all look like monsters until you go and claim them and see the points givent. this is a hunting game, there should be spikes and two pointers and all that.at the end of it, id play the eff out of this game if where fully complete, but is far from it. i have 8 hours logged, and about 5-6 of those hours are tracking down blood trails of immortal deer or hiking to dead ones that aren't there. ultimately save your money and see if it comes on sale for a summer or winter steam sale, because they have months of patches they need to do before its ok to play.

												Just hit 84 hours, and I think it's time to stop.This game looks incredible, I've found myself taking tons of screenshots, especially for kills I was proud of. Let me be clear here, I don't like hunting, I don't agree with hunting, but this game is SO good that I've put 84 hours into it. The positives outnumber the negatives, but unfortunately the game has one whopping failure. So the game itself looks incredible, I've found myself reminiscing about holidays I've been on due to the realism and immersivety. The sounds fit in well with the setting (even if a few things could be worked on) The maps are huge and have some incredible points of interest that have clearly had a lot of time spent on them. The animals are difficult to hunt and you have to be mindful of many different ways in which you play in order to stalk an animal and get up and close. This is great! Going from scaring everything off in the vicinity to being able to get within 20m of a deer feels like great progress. The guns seem fairly priced, the missions tell you stories that are pretty interesting. You can choose whether or not you want to do a mission - you'd probably spend a good 50 hours walking round and exploring if killing isn't your thing. The game really is incredible. However, 84 hours in I'm here typing a review for a game that I don't recommend. So let me explain. About 20 hours into the game a friend asked me if it was worth buying, and I told them absolutely. 5 minutes later, my game crashes. My entire system crashes and I have to restart my PC manually. Frustrating, a waste of ammo and time, but no big deal. I reload the game, 5 minutes later, it crashes again. I get the frozen screen, sound loop, I can't alt-f4, I can't Ctrl-alt-delete. Again, I have to manually restart my computer. Turns out it's not just me getting this issue, so with the help of the discussions I try what seemed like 3000 different settings changes just to see if the game is playable. Next time I start up the game, I get 4-5 hours out of it then stop playing, seemed like something had worked. Load up the game again, crashes within 30 minutes. To this day I am still dealing with crashes that seem to have no correlation to any setting, any part of the map, any animal, anything. I've changed so many settings at this point that I'm literally just playing inbetween crashes and every now and then it'll crash so many times in such a short space of time I just give up.This game is literally incredible. I've had crashes ever since 16 hours and yet I've still put up with it up until now. But I cannot recommend this game. It's not badly priced, but this game desperately needed to be released as an alpha or beta. It's just not ready. There are some other bugs (floating guns, weird arm twisty thing, animals getting stuck, rocks killing you for absolutely no reason) but these do not break the game. They're few and far between and they're absolutely bearable. Sitting at my PC for 2 hours and having a game crash 30 times within that time frame is absolutely soul destroying. TO SUM UPIf you're patient, love hunting, fancy a walking simulator or even a fantastic hunting sim, then maybe give it a shot. If you want the game to run smoothly and want to play with friends, really really avoid this game. 84 hours and I don't think I'll be launching this game any time soon. I will say, the developers seem hard working and eager to fix the issues but this game was clearly rushed and isn't in a fit state to be released yet. I really hope they can fix it soon because it's such a great game, and has such great potential.			"

												I usually don't do reviews however, I seen some of the reviews and decided that I should give my input. As an original ""The Hunter"" player I had high hope's for the game. I wasn't disappointed. Overall I think they have some issues to work out but I am having alot of fun with the game. I only have a little over an hour and a half into but I'm having fun.I seen a review about the amount of animal spawns and in which case they are correct...Theres ALOT of animals to start off with. HOWEVER, if you read through the tutorial you will read that the more you hunt the more pressure you start putting on areas. Therefore, hunting will get more difficult as you play.The only bug I have noticed is sometimes when killing bears they don't like to ""die"" they just stand straight up untill you ""trophy"" them. I'm sure theres lots of fixes and updates to come...I can't wait to see what's out there! :D			"

												  i miss playing cabela's big game hunter (2002) on the ps2.  This game needs a lot of work and i really hope it does get fixed because its beautiful and mulitplayer will be fun. But all i saw was a deer running beside a bear and then they both get stuck on a tree and the deer takes 7 shots to kill then i kill the bear, then you get xp for both kills. it's poachjing not hunting :D. then after that I was trying to creep up on a elk but it saw me and ran away but it ran to a cliff and fell off and died which was pretty funny but then i jumped off the cliff as well and only lost 25 HP -.- then collected the animal turned around and saw a deer running away from me.  you run into animals way too fast and i even turned off all the hints and tracking stuff so i could be relying on my calls and sent but i still found animals no problem. I just think if they added that you have to buy tags for the animal you want and fix the AI making them not get stuck on ♥♥♥♥ and spread them out it will be a great game but for now i say wait			"

												[Edited 20/02/2017 1711hrs]I'm not usually inclined to write a review but i feel i ought to for this game, i will do my best to keep this updated as time goes on.For those of you that have played thehunter classic i wouldn't recommend it, for those of you that havn't played thehunter classic i still wouldn't wholeheartedly recommend, there are far too many things that the classic has or did better that dont exist in this new release to make it worth buying. A visual representation of where my view on this game is at the moment. I don't recommend  | I recommend[--------------------------//-|--------------------------]Pros:- Jumping! brilliant feature! Having the ability to jump up onto rocks above open terrain, go prone and wait for unsuspecting prey is a brilliant feature, personally i much prefer looking at terrain for firing positions than using the pre determined structures.- Not having to use your Huntermate to track animals, although it does aid you with an easy to follow cone of direction, you can quite happily walk with your rifle in your hands and track animals which helps dramatically in reducing the time to take the shot, nothing worse than cresting dead ground to find the animal standing mere metres away, with only your phone in your hand.- Having Need zones on the map - whether it be drinking, sleeping  or eating, you are given a time period in which animals of that type will use these need zones,which helps dramatically at ambushing prey and also giving them a less random feel, they live somewhat structured lives.- A few different ammo types per weapon, allows you to pick and choose which type of arrow or round you would prefer to use, Softpoint or Polymer.- Easy to see and understand unlockable skills, this gives an RPG feel to the game as you feel you are progressing toward something, it also gives you the choice in which areas you would like to progress, whether it be stalking or ambushing, and perks for the type of weapons you use most.- Vast expanse of land to hunt on, this game truly does feel vast with two large reserves to hunt on, both with different landscapes.- The sheer amount of animals on each reserve is staggering and i doubt you have to go particular far in any direction from any position in order to find them wandering around.- Animals regularly herd together, the most i've seen so far was about 30 odd whitetails wandering together at the foot of a valley, it truly was a sight to see.- Hunting animals in the same area means animals will start to avoid that area until it has ""cooled down"", animals with their skittish nature will avoid areas in which they feel threatened, you will still see animals in these areas just less of them, and the more you hunt in the same spot the less animals will wander into it.- When walking through particular thick vegetation/trees you hear the sound of your nylon jacket, which is incredibly immersive, however rabbits running through the same vegetation appear the make the same noise, i didnt know rabbits were made of nylon (i will admit that after several years of neglecting ear defense this may just be that my hearing is shot and that the two sounds appear to me as the same sound)- There is a guide available by Daniel which shows you how to make your game less blurry and sharper, im enjoying the game more now that i have wiped the slober out of my eyes.- No microtransactions - probably the biggest selling point of this game.- Heart rate and stances effecting weapon sway, this prevents you from being able to run and gun accurately (not that you would neccesarily want to but a good game mechanic to have)- When in the prone position grass and foliage infront of you inhibits sight picture on target, personally i love this, it requires you to either crawl forward to flatten the grass then crawl back in order to optomise your firing postion, or move to a spot where grass wont effect your sight. - The ability to turn off tutorials / mission system / multiplayer nametags / downed animal highlight / spotting outline / audio clue visualization / spatial tracking cone / Points of interest / need zone icons / track effects. Turning everything off gives you the ability to hunt with your own hearing and sight.- Animals leave ""channels"" in long grass and brush, this helps when stalking or chasing down a wounded animal as an almost perfect trail is left behind.Cons:- Graphics, the graphics are OK but are incredibly hard to run for those with dated PCs, i would go as far to say it is heavily unoptimised. Even with the ability to max any modern released game you will be pushing 30 - 60 FPS with medium/high settings in which the foliage will look less than realistic.- The horrible grind to unlock weapons/lures/etc in the shops - you have to harvest an outrageous amount of animals in order to unlock even the most simple lures or weapon of choice, i feel you should be able to buy any of the kit from get go.- Animals very rarily spook, you can shoot and harvest one only to walk a short distance and repeat, gunshots/running for the most part dont have a very large spook radius.- Fast traveling is virtually non existent which is a pain as you have to take time to travel to need zones or particular favourite spots, the ability to put down tents in TheHunter classic sorted this problem.- No ability to errect your own structures, such as tree stands, 360 stands, ground hides etc, the fact that TheHunter classic has this feature yet the new edition doesn't is a real shame, it feels like a real step backwards.- By Comparison to TheHunter classic there is very little equipment/weapons/lures available, which i hope with potential future DLC will be expanded upon, again a step backwards.- The game states that clothes do not have any effect on whether animals can detect you, this again is a feature that is included in theHunter classic with the addition of Ghillie suits, 3D sneaky clothing etc.- The bugs although not game destroying are rather annoying and with some fairly simple bugs i am astounded that this game was released with them, and that after days after release they still persist is mind boggling.- According to the games sound indicator, you give the same amount of sound crawling slowly as you do running.- No ability to range your rifle to anything other than the pre determined 100m.Overall i feel this game is headed in the right direction but as it currently stands lacks some pretty major components of a hunter game, i feel a mixture between this and TheHunter Classic would be ideal, bring back some of those core gameplay elements whilst also bringing in better optimisation and bringing the grind feeling down to a nice enjoyable level and giving the player more freedom on what to hunt from the get go.Having said all that i still feel a burning urge to make this review even longer and do a side by side comparison of the two games which would show you just many features/gameplay aspects have been removed for the sake of improving the graphics, there are so many!

												This game is great fun, plays just like theHunter classic. I haven't had any issues with crashes like most others are complaining about, but then again im not playing on a potato.There are quite a few bugs here and there but nothing they can't patch pretty quickly.The only issue i have is the ammount of animals on the Lake map is way too high, im getting warning calls left right and center and im not even moving. I feel like the sound element to it or sight is not working as intended.But in all the game is amazing, looks amazing and runs amazingly.P.s who the hell done the UI design lol? an apprentice?EDIT: They have fixed quite a lot of bugs now with the latest 1.1 Patch.

												The game is glitchy, buggy as heck, continuous frame drops and I have a newer Graphics card and system so that isnt the issue. The sound clips out where either its too loud or all togther you cannot hear any sounds in the game for a bit such as gun shots or animal noises or even the environment, and all together it just was not what was expected which was a major let down. It was upsetting as I wanted to get by and just say ♥♥♥♥ it to the fact that the frame drops happened occasionally and the sound wasn't the greatest but not the worst just more of an annoyance. But when I could not harvest my kills from the obnoxious plethora of animals that would just be stuck running in the same spot or not responding at all, It made it feel unplayable. I had looked forward to this game very much as I was a fan of the orignial TheHunter but this was a major let down and in no way an exeperience like its predecesor. Sadly I would not recommend this game as I thought I would have. 4/10			"

												This game has alot of bugs, don't get me wrong it is playable but damn it has so much bugs.This is the reason why I dislike the game and it is the only reason:Furthermore the developers want to bring this game to the consoles which means that there will be less support on the pc version and on the other hand a extremly bugged version for the consoles because this developer team is really small.

												So, before I get into this, for some unknown reason it is showing myself as having far less time than that I have clocked on on AMD Raptr.... I have tons more hours and have been playing a fair bit!So let us dive in by starting with the basics!Graphics: The graphics off this game are amazing! Seriously they are so good that you can only wish you can play on max to truely enjoy the game for what it really offers, thankfully I can so on this basis I would say the graphics alone are 9.5 out of 10 because they are that good!Audio: The guns sound good, the animal noises are good, rain, thunder, wind all are good but there are problems.  Example, you can hear the rain hammering down when walking but turn around and no rain sound at all, face forward and raining.. It's spinning the mouse to get different sounds which is amusing but a bad bug from my point of view, so I would say here 7 out of 10!Controls: The controls are simple to get used too, but the menu system controlling is horrible and buggy I found, the same as my wife and close friend.  Controlling through the menu is buggy and glitch as hell but if you are rating the walking, moving, gun, swapping etc, it's spot on so I would say 7 out of 10!Gameplay and everything esle:  Now the game! Yes, this game has it's fair share of bugs and problems.  Some are more problematic than others, while some are just pure annoying!Right now as I write this review, if you start a solo game and want to change to multiplayer, you have to physcially close the game down and reopen it and select multiplayer... The same the other way around! Once in a game there is no backing out to the main screen, silly idea!Walking and the level of detail though in this game is amazing.  The grass moves when you go through it, the same as tree's and the grass leaves an imprint on the path you have followed.  Seriously the level of detail is amazing!There are two worlds and not enough animals I found! One German world (Which my wife and I with a friend found this world to be the prettiest and hardest to do) and an American world which seems bland but both worlds seem to have barely any animals in them... I think if I remember correctly there are 12 animals in total in the game and it is 6 per world, which sucks.  The worlds on the other hand are MASSIVE.  It takes a long time to walk around and often get bored a little walking and side tracking to look for fun stuff.  You can fast travel to a safe house if you got them unlocked, but that is ONLY once you unlocked it.There are no vehicles in the game which sucks because they would be amazing to have I feel like many others and many others not, but then it is your choice if you wanted to use them!This is a slow paced game, so no run and gun.  Expect to take a long time, going slow (Which is often frustrating for me at times because it feels so slow I need to sprint)Would I recommend this game? If you are a big fan of hunting games and want something that is going to draw you in and keep you focused and enjoy a slow pace simulation style game then this is the game for you!I am swinging towards a 78% yes because it is unique and offers a fun amount of hours in the game! It is also multiplayer which is a lot more fun as we know with others.  Just the bugs are slightly annoying right now, no vehicles and limited hunting is a little off putting, otherwise good job!

												Lovely game, stunning graphics.Please do understand i love the game, i will keep playing but this should not have been released yet.We should be spammed with hot patches , but the patches are far betweenFull of gamebreaking bugs.- Tracks disappear when there is to many of them.- You can not save the game where you at, so it you have to walk to area where you was hunting again if you restart the game. (pitcha a tent and sleep trough the night/saving the game would be nice)-It did not run stable on my high end gaming machine, on my server i do get the +60 FPS in Ultra stable.-Some menu items doent stick and switch back to a previous or the default value,-Animals get stuck in trees, edge of the water or in some deadend parts of the map.Beside those there some annoying glitches and things.-Sometimes your scope glitches.-Sometimes your stuck in the ground comming out of the map (a jump fixes that) -You can buy one scope and fit it on multiple guns.-Animals sometimes act like idiots, just skipping about or not moving at all when a gun is fired near them.Some stuff also need work or clarification.-I spend more then 14 hours gametime to get a picture of two bears-The numbers for the gun and ammo specs do not make any sense to me.-An ingame tutorial would be much appreciated-Most hunting stands and blinds are in spots that dont make sense, some look out on a big tree or a rock. If you would go trough the trouble putting one up you make sure you have a premium unrestricted view.-The animals should interact more. I have seen a bear sitting and a dear bumped into him but he did not care at all.And last but not least;IT FLIPPING RAINS TO MUCH.This is a game, a single player game, let us choose if we want it to rain or not.It rains in real life, it is depressing, why would i durring my game time have it rain too?It is not even a realistic weather pattren, it flipping rains for 45 mitutes in an hour.If it would rain for a whole day in 1 in 15 game days it would be fine but how  it is done now is ridiculous.My faith in the ""no rain"" menu button that actualy sticks in a future patch is extreme high.Ofcourse it all going to be fixed and all will be honky donkey, but this should be tested before they relased the game.I do not want to participated in a payed betatest games anymore, this  game almost feels like a beta on the moment.Normaly i would have waited or not even bothered to write a review, but the review and the tumbs down maybe urges the Devs to put in some hours to fix the urgent things and keep us, the customers, informed.

												Game looked ok to begin with  , but lack of interaction with the developrer and the developers  recent  hotly contested  hs 2.0 in THC and rendering 20 plus weapons useless to those who bought them with no compensation  makes one question just how much they gonna actaully listen to the community here. With all the current issues existings on both thier games and some for several yrs on THC  i would have to not recommend this game till everything is resolved if they ever manage to do that. And no one has any idea what the price tag for dlc will be but given the insane greed of this company one bet it wont be cheap.			"

												This is my second edit of this review, this time I'm going to be bit more in-depth.The game is well worth the $30 price tag. The game is gorgeous and contains 2 massive, interesting, and varied hunting reserves. I have yet to even explore more than 25% of each reserve.In my opinion the game has enough weapons for now, I've yet to use anything other than the starter rifle. The ammunition prices could be a bit more modest but I suppose it does encourage you to conserve ammo and take safe shots.The game still has a few AI bugs and UI problems here and there but after today's (3/3/2017) patch, I haven't experienced any crashes and have had more success in-game as a result of the sneaking fix. This game is relaxing, even if you don't enjoy hunting in real life (I don't) this game is still very enjoyable. Take a break from hunting and go out and explore for some artifacts, lookout points, and lore points.A few things I would like to see in the game:-Portable Campsites - Pack a tent for a mobile outpost (does not have to contain shop)-Tree Stands-Jonboats or canoes for navigating the rivers, lakes, and ponds of the world.-Fishing-Able to complete missions and unlock outposts/lookout points in multiplayer.See you on the trails!

												I must say its a great game, best hunting simulator I have ever played. People are moaning that its got its bugs and the developers are working on that as they are bringing out patches quite often to fix this which I dont mind. Compared to the classic 'TheHunter' its a very big step up, much better game play and NO RETRICTIONs on the animals which you can kill. Some people may get frusted if they have never played a hunting game like this because if you run everywhere and keep calling the deers they will just run away, to those people I do say pace yourself and leave the calls to every 4-5 in game minutes for calls and before you know it you will turn around and have a whole load of deer surrounding you, I wish I was joking but  its happened to me multiple times now. TLDR yeah it may be buggy but its a damn good game. Buy it			"

So the grafics is indeed very good! But.... the game is full of buggs and tbh it dosent feel like the devs are doing so much. Tracks dissapere, animals get stuck and you might die when you are just taking a walk. There is 2 Maps in the game. Both are in the summer. Idk why they dident make the second map winter.. Been playing +40 hours Now and i continue to find bugs.. So for now i Dont recommend the game. Mostly becuase the say that the game is complete But its not!

												A game where genuinely there are some beautiful scenes, but patience and understanding mechanics are required. In this case, hunting expierence helps too.But don't not buy this game if you have never hunted. It is a beautiful game in itself. I find myself more looking at nature and enjoying the beauty of this game more than aiming and shooting at something. But then it can be difficult to get your target in your sights. But from my expierence in the woods, that's what I am used to.After putting a few hours into The Hunter: Call of the Wild, I enjoy it. I plan to put more time into it over the years. Visually it is a very beautiful game. If running around looking for the 360 no scope is your thing pass on this game, but if you are looking for a peaceful tranquil game where you can enjoy the simulated nature found inside this game give it a shot.

												This game had high promise but they have unfortunately decided not to fix any of the bugs from the Beta session several months ago and don't really make any indication that they ever intend too.In addition, there is still no ultra-widescreen support for this game which is unbelievable in 2017, multiple crashing issues and poor performance overall. Alpha release at its best... I would reccommend waiting until they put forth at least some indication that they intend on working on these issues.			"

												Short Review: The best hunting game I've ever played. It does have various bugs that do cause minor inconvenience at times. I simply haven't run into any problems that won't be fixed in a reasonable time frame. I can't play this game without stopping to appreciate the beautiful world they've created. I thoroughly enjoy the shooting mechanics in place for this game. I'd recommend this game to anyone who can appreciate a calm/casual hunting game with a decent amount of shooting mechanic depth. It's got plenty of content and land to explore. If you don't mind walking long distances and slow crouching for some period of time, you'll find this game to be quite relaxing! I expect myself to play a decent amount of this game before I get my fill!			"

												I bought this hoping it would be The Hunter 2. It's more like The Hunter Lite. It's a shooting gallery with pretty graphics. The difficult hunts that made the original so appealing are replaced with animals everywhere with no sense of self preservation. They call constantly and let you walk right up to them before they run.. And they even call several times specifically to warn you that they are about to run. So you can just run around at a full sprint and wait for the warning calls then stop and shoot them. Often times a shot doesn't even spook near by animals so you can lay waste to entire herds in a short time. The leveling grind also promotes this style of gameplay, needing to both earn ridiculous amounts of cash to buy new equipment as well as needing a ton of XP to unlock the ability to even purchase it. On the plus side its pretty, the landscapes are massive, the draw distance has nearly doubled and the shooting feels a lot better than classic. The game has a lot of potential but this isn't early access, this is a full release and they have no obligation to change anything. This combined with the history of Primal leaves one with doubts about the future of this title. Hopeful doubts, but doubts nonetheless.			"

												[[Edited for typos]]Disappointing and confusing.Great audio and looks gorgeous but the menus were a bit broken (Esc to exit does nothing) and forgot my settings every few minutes. I couldn't reliably reproduce this, it just happened occasionally.Whilst I understand the hearing capabilities of my prey, the Sound Meter at the bottom right suggests that crawling prone through soft(!) grass makes the same amount of noise as running and jumping around in the water or dry underbrush, with a few patches of grass as exception.Crouching makes the same noise level according to the meter, regardless of surface. I think we may be missing a 'creep' pace option, tippytoe style.Gun level mechanic from the last game was better, I dislike the level gated firearms and items (more on that in a sec) and currently I'm not sure what my character is even doing on a hunting range when he messes up his reloads, wasting valuable time. Bit odd.I can't fathom why I need to be level 33(? going off of memory here) in order to purchase wind direction detector spray when the compass automatically shows wind direction /and/ there's a perk for it already.The visiblity icon thing was neat, I suppose.I think I'll stick with TheHunter Classic.

												Absolutely loving this game!  Enjoying the fact that there are missions and you have to ""earn"" everything by gaining experience points which can be transfered to skill points to increase your hunting abilities, yes it is a little buggy but it is a fairly new game, the bugs will be ironed out eventually but aside from that it is awesome!

												Fantastic game. The visuals, when maxxed, are gorgoeus, almost photorealistic. Sure there are bugs, glitches, odd nuances that the game has. These can all be fixed by patches. The base game is fanstastic. The rush of killing a new animal, exploring the open wilderness. As long as they keep updating the game, this will probably be the best hunting game ever made. The game is really really relaxing, if you just wanted to relax before work or bed, hop into this for a little bit. I also hope they support mods, while I highly doubt it, it would be fanstastic to see people add new content. Overall, about 6 hours in, it's a good time killer, and the mechanics of the game are really solid, teh way you can see the kill shots and whatnot. Would recommend.			"

												With only 3 hours into the game as of writing it, theres only so much I can say about it. Currently it feels like a Euro Truck Simulator 2 game, where relaxing and walking around is really fun and enjoyable, the immersion is lovely but as people said below there is  a tiny thing or two that you may want to look out for.Firstly the game might be frustrating if you're new and thinking you can sprint everywhere and noscope stuff, well stop doing that and if you refuse to and keep on noscoping then back into the cesspool of Call of Duty.The game is buggy, quite buggy but it seems fairly optimized with a R280x and 8350 8x core processor, I've yet to see any crashes and i've done most of the three hours in one session so it seems to be pretty solid from my standpoint.Now would I recommend it? Well if you want a game that is just about walking around and hunting with full immersion like listening on trance at a sunday, then hell yeah go for it. But if you want alot more then I suggest waiting until they fixed some of the bugs and add some more content.... What? I liked it! Sorry if you didn't.. jerks..			"

												This game is AMAZING! I love how beautiful it is and how exciting it can be! I love how the skill system works as well as the item shop. Every animal encounter is so much fun. I already have 30 hours and can't stop playing. I haven't even explored 25% of one of the 2 maps. If you are into hunting or like exploring this is a wonderful game for you.However there are a lot of weird bugs in multiplayer and issues with the menu. Its pretty stable on my pc but I've had plenty of issues with not being able to collect my animal that I shot in multiplayer, as well as the shop menu having issues with the item pictures not showing up after double clicking an item. I kinda wish this would have been labeled as a early access because there are a ton of things that are not working right at times. I hate to say that because I don't want to take away from anyone wanting to buy the game... I love it and I really hope the Dev team don't stop putting out updates to fix these problems. I know I'll do my best to put in bug reports!But yeah worth the money in my opinion but that's me.			"

I just... wowEdit after actually playing some: Yep bug ridden, no where near the content of theHunter: Classic. what bugs are there don't usually break the game, the pricing system seems abit weird.Looks pretty, only redeeming feature.Still can't recommend either theHunter CotW or Classic, I'll still play CotW only because you don't get extored playing this even though it has ♥♥♥♥ all content compared to classic.Edit 20/02/17:After sinking some 18 or so hours into the game and discovering some things.there's more animals then i first thought just the leaderboard doesn't track every species (not that it updates your kills anyway -_- ) It's still very... just... bugs, some of them funny but some make you want to rage, forinstance. i spent about 30min heading north to get to a lookout to find where that aera's outpost was, the outpost was on the other side of a mission i had so i went into the mission aera and chilled out, called some Fallow to me. i went to go into my settings option to turn my sound back up (because wind and rain will blow your ears out if you have headphones) and the second i hit ""System"" in the menu (where options and exit to desktop options are) the game exited to windows without a prompt, so now i have about a 20-30min run back up to that lodge as i've got a mountain to go around. As it turns out there's a bug that when you press ""System"" instead of opening the side menu that lists Options and Exit to window buttons, it just exits to windows... ♥♥♥♥ my life.The animal pathing is messed up, they're always getting stuck on rocks and running on the spot. and they act like skyrim horses when they don't get stuck.Exibit A

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=867566516Enough said.Some of the things in the game aren't explained properly and some are just worded wrong completely for example, one of the skills you can unlock is called ""I'm only happy when it's raining"" and there's two levels and they go like this.Lvl 1: Decrease visablity when it's foggy.Lvl 2: Decrease visablity when it's raining.See the problem? (This is a perk by the way, not something that disadvantages you), if you don't then my point has been validated.Multiplayer, It's still kinda broken. people are having more luck joining games but as we found out pressing F6 i think it's the multiplayer options for the lobby leader, just pressing that button was booting someone at random from our game so that was fun.Another issue i have is if you join your friend in MP, you both walk upto the other side of the map hunting and exploring on the way. If you find a lookout, lodge, point of interest, You simply can't interact with them which pisses me off for lodges. if you want to unlock that lodge you have to go back to single player and walk all the way back to the other side of the map and press E on it in SP.Speaking of pressing E on things it's a fun little mini game at points of interest, some of them i haven't been able to collect/interact with, some have been fine, others i have to run around them jumping and looking into the sky to get the interact option... and finally how many times andwhat i've been killed by.Wild Animals: 0Skyriming and simply falling down sheer clifs: 0 (I do it allot, fastest way to get down the mountain)Other players: 0 (if you get shot in the face the bullet impact decal is actually cement so go figure, were's actually statues hunting wildlife in the game)Trees: 4, Yes i've been killed 4 times by inanimate trees the second most lethal thing in the game.Rocks: 15, This is encluding my encounter when i started playing which killed me about 9 times respawning me in the same place to die again over and over, other times i'll just be walking along and stand on a rock funny and I instantly die sooo.... yeah.The good :D yes there's actually good.. well kinda.The game is very pretty and being an AMD Processor user i was greatful to realise their new engine actually spreads the load evenly over all 8 threads of my FX8350 and i'm actually maxing out my GTX 1060 running almost everything on ultra.there is however a slight kind of fuzzy ness i think caused by the Anti-Alisasing (for the record i have no idea what i'm talking about but it seems that kind of blurry/jagged edge look)There's also some issues where i'll play along at 50ish FPS in 1080p and then my FPS just tanks to 15-20 and it's eyestraining to play forcing me to restart the game (ofcourse if i haven't gotten to that unclaimed lodge i have to do the walk all over again -_-"").Final Verdict:When this game works, it works in the most epic of fasions and i've had some rather intense encounters with Fallow deer. after following a herd i engaged some distance i finally found one that had dropped but i was then attacked by two cornered fallow, ended up using iron sites at 16m and lungshotting one that charged me while the other charged me right after and got away before i could get my bearings and get shots off in its direction.However in my opinion the game needs allot more polish and it should not have been released in its current state, I feel sorry for my fellow hunters who have to deal with the fustration of this game while it's being fixed and that's if it gets fixed. I've seen on a game news site they were responsible for Just Cause 3 and Mad Max, Mad max never had it's little niggles fixed like getting stuck and just derpy things and the short time i had Just cause i found it aweful to play, the controls and menus were just bad and poorly laid out and it shows how they've made the menus in theHunter: CotW.Edit for update 1.1:This game has become a boring walk around shoot ♥♥♥♥, by removing the work you had to put in to get the best stuff in the game they've literally turned their game into a feature bland theHunter Classic that looks pretty.

												Sorry bit of a long one The Hunter call of the wild is one of the most stunning games graphical I have seen  in a long time the views are stunning which gives the game a real feel I have spent a long time just walking around and soaking in the amazing views form the lookout points and just watching the day go by sad I know but hay paid my money my game to play.The gun physics are good not being a hunter in real life and not having any time around real firearms can’t honestly say what a real rifle should do whist crouching behind a tree trying to shoot a moose at 150m but for a game they feel nice the rifle recoil seem fair and the bullet travel seems fair what has to be remembered is that this is not a FPS this is a hunting game so no 360 no scopes here the game is trying to simulate a real hunting feel (as stated never hunted so what do I know lol)The animals look real nice even though their behaviour is some time is not realistic never seen a deer walk round in circles four times but on a whole they seem to do as they should solo walks and group feeding and resting Now down to the pros and consProsGraphicsThese are amazing great textures on the animals the map is first class the grass bends beneath you and the animals Weather The sunny days look great with the sun shafts coming though trees and structures, the rain affects look amazing and the thunder sounds kudos to the sound engineers AnimalsThe animals are modelled and animated to a level which cannot really be complained about the behaviour of each species is slightly different every animal will give a warning call just to let you know you are getting to close but the red fox will be gone before you can even see it the bison on  the other hand will stand they ground for a little longer and may even turn the tables on you with you get them cornered Equipment They is a good selection of weapons in the game ranging from rifles to bows you start off with a single rifle for free and the stock ammo is free to buy the other weapons unlock on a rifle score points system the news guns are expensive which depending on your view is a good or bad thing my view is that this is a good thing as this makes you weigh up the options whilst buying new equipment thing like new calls will bring in small less value targets but with the numbers you can harvest will bring your money back up but this will is countered by the problem that hitting larger targets with a smaller calibre weapon will mean you have to track a wounded animal further cutting down on the number of harvests on each visit Cons Weather It rains a lot in this game be this just that the sound engineer had to spend days getting rain and thunders sounds so they put a lot in to make in worth their while I don’t know but it just seem to  rain all the time Animals I have seen on a few sessions animals getting stuck on trees and bushes I know people will say easy kill but in a game that is so amazing to look at a black bear doing the running man at a tree breaks the immersion Other Just a couple of things that made me scratch my head when I saw that they we not in the game at release and sorry to the devs if these are been implemented after this review (as if they read this lol) track ir not supported this was supported in the last the hunter title but has been replaced not to much of a problem as this do’s not really affected the game play but would be nice to have the ability to look around whilst walking as in real life, also the trophy shot has gone which was a bit of a surprise as the photo with your kill is a big part of hunter sharing with friends and other hunters a like I have seen an option on the main menu for a gallery which i have to hope means that it will make a return in a later patch My view The hunter call of the wild is the stepping stone from the hunter we all wanted this is not a game for people that are wanting to just walk in to a field and shoot 15 moose and walk away With the success of the hunter series so far this game has the potential to have the same success and in 8 years time have a still booming fan base  "

												Okay ... so this are one of those games you want to take your time with and appreciate what this game has to offer.After playing an intense CS GO comp or some COD. You really want to immerse yourself into this game. Like trust me this game is really, really good. The graphics in this game is super gorgeous. If it was a girl.. I'd marry her.The hunting is superb. There is nothing more satisfying then killing a animal after hours of walking and tracking.And I don't mind the walking because I just love to take in the scenery and the rain and the sounds and the rest this game has to offer.The sounds are soooooooooo good. The rain wants to make me sleep. The thunder wants me to grab a blanket and go hidein the cubboard or somewhere. All I want in this game is vehicles. Would be cool to drive around and sometimes when you too lazy to shoot. Just drive over you're deer. EZ PZ ! 0_0 . Some glitches here and there but nothing too intense. Well done the developers!

												Ok where to start this is a senic almost perfect game. but thats where it end as of now multiplayer is bugged.you cant apply settings in game one example is the aim mode toggle you can change it but as soon as you shoot it goes back to default. the crashes omfg the crashes. the original the hunter had problems for months and i fear this game will be simular to sadly.the where looking for betatesters those surly did a great job well done picking them... over to gameplay this sure have a more arcade angle on the hunting compared to the hunter original. a good thing for getting more players in to it. animal behavior  seems to be really strange in this game compared to the original. the hunter pressure is not working as intended i noticed the more i shoot in a area the more animals i see and hear should be the other way around i think personally i dont like the whole level to get gear thing i think the game would be more enjoyable if i could get stuff ♥♥♥ soon as i had money for it. wounder if you should get the game? at the current state i would put the value to $10 so thats my answer.

												This is the first review im writing. The reason is because i was so dissappointed with the Multiplayer. This should have been a early access game in my opinion. First off, the game does not support resolutions above 2000x and widescreens. So you have to downscale and miss the whole graphic part.Seccond off. Everytime you join a multiplayer game you start at the same point, and the game bugs so you cant access the different traveling locations.Been bugged 2 times where im tossed 150 meeters up in the air and die when i land.Also, you cant hunt together with your friends, you actually hunt 1 by 1. If you help spotting the animal, you get no points, xp or credits. You have to hit the animal in order to get XP. "

												This game definitely wasn't ready for release. It's a (pretty bad) beta at best.After reading on the forums that Stefan, one of the developers, refuses to acknowledge one of the most game-breaking bugs (see below) and closes threads, I decided to request a refund.GraphicsThe game is pretty gorgeous looking, that's for sure. Good textures, day/night cycle, dynamic weather, wind moving leaves, grass, etc.I did experience a few minor issues though, like clouds flickering, the handheld occasionally being shown without its display (just the frame) or rain falling right through the roof of a deer stand (how there's still devs in 2017 not paying attention to something like that is beyond me).SoundSounds are very inconsistent in quality. Some sound very realistic with high production quality, others just sound terrible, with static noise at the beginning and/or end of the sound sample (at least when playing with headphones this was easily perceivable).I also repeatedly had issues with sounds ending abruptly (like animal calls or birds chirping) or stuttering, or ambient sounds like wind changing way too fast.Obviously issues like that are constantly breaking someones immersion.InterfaceThe menus are buggy, with buttons not always reacting to clicks. Some options like mouse sensitivity are also a pain to use, since you can only increase/decrease the value by clicking arrows to the left or right. There's no slider or a way to type in a value directly. Annoying, especially if the game doesn't save the settings properly and you have to re-do them the next time you launch the game. There's also no way to go back to the main menu -- you have to quit and restart the game for that (no joke).Several HUD elements don't scale properly when playing on a 16:10 screen. For example, the compass is oval, and markers on the map are oval as well. I suspect people with widescreen-monitors like 21:9 will be affected by this as well.There's also graphical glitches on the map, like terrain textures that aren't properly stitched together, and map overlays that are only partially visible.You can also disable certain aspects of the HUD (like tutorial hints or point of interest markers) or change how animal tracks are being visualized. Sometimes HUD elements can get stuck on your screen or behave strangely if you change the settings and don't restart the game afterwards.Animal AII'm not an animal expert, so I can't talk too much about this topic. But at least on two occasions, after firing a shot, deer ran away, just to come back several minutes later, walking right towards me, coming as close as 10 meters and not notice me at all. Well, I doubt any real animal would do that, unless they are suicidal.There's also reports of animals getting stuck, but I haven't seen that myself in game.Shooting/gunplayShooting seems weird. First I thought I'm doing something wrong, like missing vital organs, since I couldn't even kill non-moving small game from less than 50 meters. I then read in another review that someone was testing the shooting on stuck animals, and had to hit them with up to 6 rounds to kill them, from only a few meters away.A hunting game with broken gun mechanics. Awesome.PerformanceI'm on Windows 7 with an Intel i5-3570K (3.4 GHz, 4 cores, 4 threads) and a Radeon RX 470 (4 GB VRAM). I maxed out all graphics settings, only turned off motion blur. Resolution was set to 2560 × 1600 to reduce flickering of the foliage (native screen resolution is 1920 × 1200).I didn't measure the frames per second, but it was around 30. Which in my book is okay for a slow-paced game like this.ControlsMouse sensitivity is annoyingly low when using binoculars or scopes, even when set to 100 in the settings (the maximum). Maybe it's on purpose to make shooting more difficult, but then at least exclude the binoculars from that 'mechanic'.One severe issue is that you can't walk slowly when using keyboard & mouse, meaning your noise level is always at max when moving, no matter if you're standing, crouching or prone. For comparison, I tested it with my Xbox gamepad and it's fine there, but why would I play a first person hunting game on the PC with a controller?Now, as mentioned at the top of the review, several people have pointed out that issue on the forums, but it seems the developers just try to ignore it and refuse to acknowledge this being a major problem. Which led me to requesting a refund. Because it's bad enough to release a game in a state like this, but then trying to silence or ignore issues... I refuse to support stuff like that.If they fix all these issues (and there's a bunch more I didn't experience personally or forgot to mention) I'll gladly purchase this game again, but until then I recommend everyone to wait and see if the devs get their **** together.

												After 6 hours, as of right now, I can say that if you are interested, you should buy this game now. The occasional bugs are dont stop the game from still being enjoyable, and most of the ""game breaking"" bugs have been fixed, except for the crashing, which for me, I figured how to resolve. HOW TO FIX THE CRASHING: *at least for meAs soon as you start the game, immediately hit continue and dont spend time on the home screen. For some reason that worked for me, and I hope it helps other people. PROS/CONS:Pros: Animals are mostly everywhere making the game at a good pace, not to fast nor slow.Good sound designGood Graphics Wide variety of ammo types for each gunMaps are giantLots to explore INCREASED VIEW DISTANCECons: Cannot distinguish male from female calls unless you unlock the part of the skill treeFemale deer make male deer noisesAnimal AI is sometimes downright stupid, the animals walk in circles, get stuck in rocks ectNoise meter is full when crouching through short grassThats all I can think of right now, but I can say if you want it, get it now			"

												I really would like to give this game a good review. It's obviously made by professionals, and has a lot of potential. Unfortunately, it's just not possible to recommend someone spend $30 on this. There are too many bugs, and they're not just minor nuisances. It's irritating when the game starts up and the mouse cursor isn't locked to the screen, or you're just given the view from a player camera frozen in the air and you have to restart. I don't like it when you place a waypoint and it acts strangely, or the screen of your smart device disappears, or when you have to click a menu element five times to get it to respond. But when animals don't react to your presence, or when you shoot them and they freeze in place like statues that soak up your bullets, there's just no point in playing. The game's just broken, and you shouldn't buy something that's broken. Bugs aside, the only complaint I have is that the game is trying to be as realistic as possible, but geometry of the terrain is just generic video game terrain that doesn't even remotely resemble reality. They could salvage the game at some point, but right now, don't buy it.			"

												Awesome game! I love the whole concept of it, the graphics are really beautiful. For a game that run's an open world engine I can tell this one has been optimised well. The game always runs smooth and constistant, and the clever AI system really makes hunting all the more realistic. Please be aware that this game is also still buggy although the developers are still hooking us up with updates including fix's and so on. I've owned this game for 2 days and I'm already satisified with my purchase. If your like me and quite like the great outdoors but never really has the energy to do so, then I highly recommend this game. Cheers.			"

												Fantastic game. There are minor bugs, but I hardly notice them, the graphics are good, and I love the mechanics, such as tracking and AI. There are also the small things, like tall grass being flattened where you walk, that add so much to the game. It is well worth the thirty dollars, and I cant imagine exploring the entire map, it's vastness is overwhelming. My only complaint is that I think there should be more waypoints, I personally am very distracted by the smallest of things, and end up chasing a deer miles off the trail, making it almost impossible to reach my destination.

												Don't buy it unless you want to feel like you are in Pre-Alpha testing! Freezes, crashes, bullets often don't do damage, Animals will get stuck in bushes or hover over rocks. Setting navigation is awful and clumsy. Switching from an animal call to a weapon will almost always cause your character to get stuck on whatever item is equipped. The list of problems goes on and on.  The landscapes and graphics are amazing at times but ultimately the game is ruined when you track an animal for 20 minutes just to have the game crash or to be unable to switch to your weapon to shoot it.

												There are problems with this game don't get me wrong but isn't that the case with many titles out there. Take BF4 for example, that game was terrible are launch but it became through many updates one of the most played games out there. theHunter: Call of the Wild is a great game if you are looking to take a break from more mainsteam shooters like COD or BF. What other games allows you the track an animal and stalk it until you have the perfect shot that isnt from 2010 or requires you to buy licenses (sorry fans of the first game theHunter). I know this game has its problems but they have already released 4 updates and are listening to their fan base. The graphics in this game are out of this world and make you feel like you are right there in the action. Don't fall for the people saying this game is terrible for not having the best launch. I have enjoyed this game a lot and once they fix some stuff I will be playing it more often. Highly recommened this for the person that wants to try something new!			"

												It still has some work to do such as fixing sounds, animations, and quest. Besides what there is to work on this game as of release is very slow in pace for to unlock new items requires alot of time and effortAfter some time as I have noticed that the mission reset was from my own doing, for i was using the ""start new game"" option to switch reserves instead of using the map option too. As for my previous comment, the sound issues I have with this game are with the animals, in which i have experianced animals using mating calls as warning calls as well as female animals using the sounds produced by their male counter parts (ie. does grunting). As for my comments on the animations, they are bugged for example animals have delayed or unreponsive reactions to being shot (especially at longer ranges) as well some anmation issues with the callers. Other wise this game is fairly decent but can still use some patching for a better experience.			"

Original review 17/02/2017Positives: Sound is incredible. Environment is gorgeous. Weather is fantastic. Tracking seems markedly better (though the new huntermate is practically useless). Animals react to being hit instead of just running and are visibly hurt when running away. Bears attack deer (hilarious). Weapons feel nicer.Negatives: BUGS, EVERYWHERE. Animal behaviour seems to be much worse than Classic, though could be bugged like everything else. UI sucks, buggy and badly designed in places. Mission progress resets if you change reserve. Changing reserve allows you to fast travel to any outpost you want and claim the XP again. Scoped weapons can bug out and prevent you from being able to see anything. More bugs. Bugs all day.Feels rushed to production. Full of bugs. UI design is not great and the bugs in the UI make it even worse than Classic's UI. There's currently more wrong with this game than right, which sucks.UPDATE 05/03/2017Played a few hours this morning, seemed less buggy.• Menu works generally as expected.• Animals still run into trees and rocks and inexplicably turn and walk directly away from you all the time only to return when you call them. Still don't seem to have the level of intelligence they had in classic, either.• Scopes on rifles still buggy, even when you're not using a scope they can bug out now too. • Temporary hunting stands buggy with bows (arrows shoot into wood instead of where you're aiming), not sure about rifles.Tried to play this afternoon, crashed twice in 5 minutes. Still not recommended.One last point I'll make is that I've realised, even though now it's less painful than the first iteration, the progression system is infuriating. I'm not saying it shouldn't be part of the game but its current implementation makes the game boring and repetitive.			"

												It definitely has its issues, mostly related to bugs and some optimization issues, but I've had a lot of fun with the game.  I have no history with the series or hunting games in general really, but I find this game to be incredibly relaxing and immersive.  The visuals and sounds are awesome as well as you watch day shift to night and storms suddenly roll in with high winds and heavy rain.  If you are on the edge it might be worth waiting a bit for another patch or two to roll in and see if it fixes some of the bigger issues, however I took the dive myself despite seeing quite a few negative reviews and don't regret it.Pros:- Great visuals- Immersive sound design- It could just be because this is my introduction to his type of game, but it was a thrill listening for and tracking down animals to kill.  I look forward to some more difficult targets that will require more time.- Feels welcoming to players newer to this style of game with a bit more casual presentation.  This of course could be looked at negatively to veterans of this type of game or theHunter Classic.- Speedy loading times.  I don't even have a SSD, but this game loads from the title screen into the game world very quickly which surprised me considering how large the map is.- Various challenges, quests, and lore discovery locations are sprinkled throughout the map, giving some extra activities outside of general hunting.- The two hunting reserve maps are massive in sizeCons:- The biggest issue right now is that with mouse and keyboard controls you have little to no control over the speed of your movement in each of the stances (walking, crouching, prone).  If you have a controller and test the movement out on that, you'll notice with analog control you can move the stick varying amounts to control your speed and subsequently the amount of noise you make.  Considering how important it is to try and remain silent in a hunting game, this is a pretty big issue at the moment.  Either controller movement needs to have that disabled and rework the amount of noise each stance makes, or keyboard needs an keybinding to slow your pace to a level that makes minimal sound.- While I've had no crashes (Update: I have experienced my first crash, so this does seem to be a relevant issue for many players), I have had a performance bug which was causing framerate to drop significantly when I was tracking an animal's footprints a lot.  Having too many of these tracking markers will cause the framerate to drop after opening the map or looking at your Huntermate device.  It would fix itself by either putting away the Huntermate or if you killed the tracked animal and collected your trophy.- Semi annoying menu bug that doesn't let you back out of the menu with escape unless the mouse is hovering over one of the items on the side.- A few of the animals I've shot seemed like it should have been a clean kill, but they would somehow get away with just a minor wound and run off.  More often than not I found success with my shots though.- Animal AI was a bit wonky on at least one occasion with a fox that clearly should have been trying to run away, but instead was running circles around me like a friendly pet dog or something.  Perhaps it was being aggresive and trying to attack or something, but it seemed a bit bizarre with it essentially giving me an easy kill.- Right now it is limited to 12 different animals.  These do have variations to discover, but it would be nice to see some small game targets and birds as well.  I'm assuming we'll see this added down the line at some point when they add some of the planned free and paid DLC content.- The menus ui and control of them in general just feels like it needs a rework as they look and feel like a placeholder that has been in the game since an earlier state.  There are also some issues with the controls when managing your storage where it just seems to completely break when in that particular menu and you have to back out and open it back up to do anything.

Original review 17/02/2017Positives: Sound is incredible. Environment is gorgeous. Weather is fantastic. Tracking seems markedly better (though the new huntermate is practically useless). Animals react to being hit instead of just running and are visibly hurt when running away. Bears attack deer (hilarious). Weapons feel nicer.Negatives: BUGS, EVERYWHERE. Animal behaviour seems to be much worse than Classic, though could be bugged like everything else. UI sucks, buggy and badly designed in places. Mission progress resets if you change reserve. Changing reserve allows you to fast travel to any outpost you want and claim the XP again. Scoped weapons can bug out and prevent you from being able to see anything. More bugs. Bugs all day.Feels rushed to production. Full of bugs. UI design is not great and the bugs in the UI make it even worse than Classic's UI. There's currently more wrong with this game than right, which sucks.UPDATE 05/03/2017Played a few hours this morning, seemed less buggy.• Menu works generally as expected.• Animals still run into trees and rocks and inexplicably turn and walk directly away from you all the time only to return when you call them. Still don't seem to have the level of intelligence they had in classic, either.• Scopes on rifles still buggy, even when you're not using a scope they can bug out now too. • Temporary hunting stands buggy with bows (arrows shoot into wood instead of where you're aiming), not sure about rifles.Tried to play this afternoon, crashed twice in 5 minutes. Still not recommended.One last point I'll make is that I've realised, even though now it's less painful than the first iteration, the progression system is infuriating. I'm not saying it shouldn't be part of the game but its current implementation makes the game boring and repetitive.			"

												It definitely has its issues, mostly related to bugs and some optimization issues, but I've had a lot of fun with the game.  I have no history with the series or hunting games in general really, but I find this game to be incredibly relaxing and immersive.  The visuals and sounds are awesome as well as you watch day shift to night and storms suddenly roll in with high winds and heavy rain.  If you are on the edge it might be worth waiting a bit for another patch or two to roll in and see if it fixes some of the bigger issues, however I took the dive myself despite seeing quite a few negative reviews and don't regret it.Pros:- Great visuals- Immersive sound design- It could just be because this is my introduction to his type of game, but it was a thrill listening for and tracking down animals to kill.  I look forward to some more difficult targets that will require more time.- Feels welcoming to players newer to this style of game with a bit more casual presentation.  This of course could be looked at negatively to veterans of this type of game or theHunter Classic.- Speedy loading times.  I don't even have a SSD, but this game loads from the title screen into the game world very quickly which surprised me considering how large the map is.- Various challenges, quests, and lore discovery locations are sprinkled throughout the map, giving some extra activities outside of general hunting.- The two hunting reserve maps are massive in sizeCons:- The biggest issue right now is that with mouse and keyboard controls you have little to no control over the speed of your movement in each of the stances (walking, crouching, prone).  If you have a controller and test the movement out on that, you'll notice with analog control you can move the stick varying amounts to control your speed and subsequently the amount of noise you make.  Considering how important it is to try and remain silent in a hunting game, this is a pretty big issue at the moment.  Either controller movement needs to have that disabled and rework the amount of noise each stance makes, or keyboard needs an keybinding to slow your pace to a level that makes minimal sound.- While I've had no crashes (Update: I have experienced my first crash, so this does seem to be a relevant issue for many players), I have had a performance bug which was causing framerate to drop significantly when I was tracking an animal's footprints a lot.  Having too many of these tracking markers will cause the framerate to drop after opening the map or looking at your Huntermate device.  It would fix itself by either putting away the Huntermate or if you killed the tracked animal and collected your trophy.- Semi annoying menu bug that doesn't let you back out of the menu with escape unless the mouse is hovering over one of the items on the side.- A few of the animals I've shot seemed like it should have been a clean kill, but they would somehow get away with just a minor wound and run off.

												Its a beautiful game, the graphics are stunning.  However, it has many problems.The bad:1 -The animal AI is pretty bad, they just kind of derp around until they see you or you shoot them. I literally got headbutted by a moose that didn't even see me, it was just running and I happened to be in its path. 2 - The noise level your character makes is way to high by default, the only way you can move without spooking animals is to crawl prone, or mash the move button and take one step at a time.3 - Your character gets stuck on random things for no reason.4 - Theres no anti aliasing that I can find in the graphics.. like.. why?5 - There aren't tags, so its just kind of a ""wander around murdering animals"" simulator.  This is a plus for some people id imagine, but not for the hunting simulator croud. 6 - Your character moves sooooooooo slow.  Like its really annoying.7 - The only way to get other equipment is to collect animals, and you need to kill like 50 deer to get a new rifle/scope/ect.8 - The skill tree is very poorly done.  Like one of the traits is ""See 15% less during fog"".  Like... what?  How is that a perk?9 -Theres a bunch of pointless ♥♥♥♥ on the map.  Like theres just random pillars out in the wilderness that give you ""lore"".10 - There isn't much for a tutorial in the game.. it pretty much just drops you into the world.11 - Bad frames when foliage gets really thick.The good:1 - The tracking system is very user friendly. Although not realistic.2 - The map is very good looking.3 - There are 2 zones you can hunt in, and both are very large.4 - Theres plenty of action.  This may not be good if you are looking for realism.Thoughts:This game defintely has potential, but in its current state it seems unfinished. Theres plenty of stuff to hunt if you are looking for an arcadey hunting game, that's multiplayer. But if you are in the market for a simulator, I'd skip this one for now. 5/10			"

												There are problems with this game don't get me wrong but isn't that the case with many titles out there. Take BF4 for example, that game was terrible are launch but it became through many updates one of the most played games out there. theHunter: Call of the Wild is a great game if you are looking to take a break from more mainsteam shooters like COD or BF. What other games allows you the track an animal and stalk it until you have the perfect shot that isnt from 2010 or requires you to buy licenses (sorry fans of the first game theHunter). I know this game has its problems but they have already released 4 updates and are listening to their fan base. The graphics in this game are out of this world and make you feel like you are right there in the action. Don't fall for the people saying this game is terrible for not having the best launch. I have enjoyed this game a lot and once they fix some stuff I will be playing it more often. Highly recommened this for the person that wants to try something new!			"

												An absolutely stunning game in terms of graphics and even audio, just the sound of the wind gusting by or the stunning vistas, heavy rainfall and animal vocals makes this an immersive game set in nature.The map is enormous, the scale is just simply put insane, you can walk for hours and hours and it won't get repetitive as it feels like its several maps in one with the diversity each area brings.Not to mention the amazing grass effects, you could if you want track an animal by following the grass it flattened, and you can also see your own and other players their paths, ocassionally i also used this to get a clean prone shot where normally that wouldn't be possible due to the grass being in the way.But each game comes with its downsides and this game also has no shortage of those.The gamebreaking ones to me were:In Multiplayer only the host can unlock map objects, such as hunting stands / outposts (important one, they allow fast travel)Animals get stuck, from my 12 hour experience i would say i have seen 1 in 8 getting stuck, mostly on edges or rocks with bears being a big outlier as i have seen 1 in 4 of them getting stuck.The UI design is unintuitive, being unable to exit to menu and aspecially when it comes to loading ammo/scopes onto a weapon, it's also impossible to read some of the descriptions as the text moves offscreen, and in quite a few cases i saw what i can only describe as a alpha/beta-like placeholder text for some of the ammo/scopes.Some minor issues/bugs i had were:Some crashes when tabbing out and back into the game, i fixed this by adding the ""/Borderless"" in the steam launch options.Sometimes got a bug with my scope being off center forcing me to restart the game, the adjustment ontop of the scope itself became my crosshair, unequipping etc didn't fix it sadly.In Multiplayer when another player jumps its heard across the map, i suppose this might be an engine issue as it also happened in the previous hunter game with someone reloading.When you fatally hit an animal they sometimes do this weird freeze for up to 1 second and then start to ragdoll, i would love to see this changed / fixed so that you feel more feedback from the bullet impact and it kinda just looks awkward as it is currently.Animals don't spook enough from gunshots sometimes it feels asif they don't even hear the gunshot, i've been able to shoot up to 3 animals ocassionally before they even started getting spooked, i would like to see the range that animals get spooked by gunshots increased.Animals don't seem to interact with eachother, i would've hoped they would introduce something like this, i believe they added something similar to classic with the introduction of wolves so it would be nice if this could be added eventually.And finally theres just too many animals on Layton district, i would prefer it if they were a bit more rare or more easily spooked just recently i shot 5 bears within 10 minutes and before that about 3 within 4 minutes, one of which was stuck underneath a bridge, although Hirschfelden seems fine.It's also too easy to spot an animal by zooming in on where its call came from, it feels like its fine when you are scoped out and they callout as it covers a wide area but you can zoom in to get a pinpoint location on where it called out from, I'm not sure if thats by design or not but it makes it too easy, you can turn the call direction and other effects off in the settings, but it would be nice to have a middle groundI would still recommend the game to anyone remotely interested in the setting or who played the previous game, it does clearly have some bugs that makes you question why it was released so soon,But if they fix / change most of these issues, i can see this as one of the best games this year and i look forward to what content they might still bring out.All in all what is here is a gorgeous landscape filled with tons of animals to hunt, great gunplay mechanics such as bullet drop and organ hits, amazing graphics and audio, but also some of the worst UI i've seen in a while, and quite some bugs which hopefully get fixed soon.

												To start off with, this is an absolutely beautiful game. The environment is stunning and the texturing and animations for the animals are incredible. The sounds are amazing. They've definitely done an excellent job with creating a visually spectacular game. However, I don't want a hunting game that's just pretty to look at, and that's just about all this one is so far - pretty.It is essentially a very dumbed down version of theHunter: Classic. While they improved certain mechanics such as the tracking system - making it so you don't have to have the HunterMate in your hand in order to track animals - and a visual wind direction right on the compass, they drastically oversimplified others. Size/rack variations are practically non-existant from what I've seen thus far, small game other than coyote is present, but not able to be harvested, there's no trophy shots (although you can always just take a photo manually prior to harvest), skill progression is global rather than per-species, and is based on general XP gain rather than skill-specific XP, and many of the points of interest which say they grant skill/perk points do not actually do so.  Overall it feels like they've gone the way of a Cabela's game - going from a simulation heavy title to an very arcade-like experience.Hopefully a lot of those issues can be handled by an update. Until then, if you're looking for something close to theHunter: Classic, this simply isn't it.			"

												Sorry, but this game is UNFINISHED. And:The amount of bugs is unacceptable for a game costing 30€ and being not early access. Some of the bugs are not even bugs - they are just a sign that the game is not ready yet. Example? - No EXIT-button in the menu (it seems due to the fact this game is obv. a console-port from work in progress --> yes, you will play an alpha-version on PC from a console-port which is not even released yet in 03/2017)- menu is absolutely horrible, buggy, ugly and unfinished. It's a conundrum how to put sighs and amunition on a weapon --> as mentioned, it's obviously a rough console-port- menu stays open in the background - so during game you change options, map or even fast travel incidently when 'hitting' something with your mouse which is hiding behind in the hidden but open menu (edit: solved with patch 1.41)- sounds are missing, too loud, not playing sometimes or not fitting (for example in muliplayer you can hear callers extremly loud even when it comes from a player on the other end of the map)- descriptions for some amuntion and options is completely wrong or reversed or do not work at all- why the hell you can find a scope for revolvers in the section for riffles? This is no serious bug, but shows that the developers throw this pre-alpha-game on the market even without ironing out the most visible errors- crasehes to desktop are very common for lots of users. In my case I do suffer it accidently over a period of timeThe game seems very unbalanced. And I think, the developers know it. What else could be the reason, they changed for expample the price of amunition and DOUBLED it. This is no tweaking of the balance - this is reinventing the game settings. There is no possibility for changing the game hardness. For beginners it seems to be good, running in ZOO full of animals. But for advanced guys this is no fun. Too  much animals in the game. And part of the animals are completely AI-buggy. Example?I hunted down approx. 15 deers in the northern part of the US-map. They stood in shallow water and did not react when shooting on them or on they neighbours. Other animals stick in rocks or trees. Or do not react at all. Example (not my clip):

Sorry - but I can not recomend this game due to the fact, that CORE ELEMENTS of this game are messed up. Edit 11.03.2017:After about 60 hours playing this thing, it suddenly started to crash every 3 minutes. In both maps. With same PC-configuration, even without changing anything on the PC (it's the gamig computer). I regard it as completely unacceptable by DEVELOPERS and PUBLISHERS to release this game and/or not willing to give a refund. The problems did not start inbetween the first 2 hours of playing - so STEAM is not willing to take back this bug-feast.Edit 27.03.2017:Patch 1.4 and still no real progress. Players find NEW BUGS en masse, weappons are out of order, developers are still not able to ad a simple button in the menue, UI has still very serious bugs, animal-AI still extrem bad and for lots of players the game does not even start!But developers have a new information for us:THEY ARE WORKING ON THE CONSOLE-PORT to XBox and PlayStation! Great. They are concentrating on real important topics:Make MORE money! Do not listen to customers, or even try to iron out bugs. Make MORE money!Happy Hunting!Edit 29.03.2017 Patch 4.1:Small patch, UI ist still a mess and partly not functioning. Players report newe bugs or bugs beeing solved now reactivated (for example dying instantly on game start).Edit 31.03.2017:Now due to my repeated criticism in the forum I have been BANNED. But not even banned, ALL POSTS, ANSWERS (even very constructive to help players overcome bugs) have been DELETED. Everything without a trace. And I am not the only one...THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO OVERCOME BUGS. This is the way of censoring!			"

												While I would reccomend this game for the hunting enthusiast, I would caution casual or fast-paced gamers from playing. This game requires A LOT of time and effort to get anything done. Movement is slow, the game is quite demanding on moderate systems, and kills are very few and far between. Just today, I have spent almost four full hours of playing the game and have only managed to kill one deer. Yes, the game looks amazing and is very realistic, but it is certianly not something that the ""average gamer"" would enjoy. Where other games have long hours of grinding, where you're at least doing SOMETHING, this game has you walking (at an extremely slow pace to keep the animals from getting scared off) for hours on end with little-to-no signs of life for most of that time.While I commend the developers for making a challenging and realistic game, I would advise them to put options into the game to increase the spawn rate of animals in single player worlds and on multiplayer servers. To spend so much time in the game and get little out of it is not something that people enjoy. The game isn't difficult, it just discourages people playing it because of how little actually happens in the game.			"

												For fans of the subscription based classic, the new engine allows for a lot of previous shortcomings to be overcome. The draw distance has been extended and the vibrant environments are lovingly crafted and perfect to while the hours away in.However, a number of core features are sorely missing. The lack of an appropriate way to take photographs of trophies, no community wide competitions, and a lack of any trophy record keeping outside of raw statistics results in a game where every Buck is just a number.From the rushed and huddled menu design to missing fundamental features, this is a title with a lot of potential, but with a lot of confusing omissions.

												*Editing review*2017-02-19Okay so ive been playing non-stop for the past days since release, i am now level 19.COTW still runs great and the bugs really dont bother me at all, but after playing so much, the flaws in the gameplay really become an apparent issue.Too many animals, they are everywhere almost all the time, very rarely do you go 30 mins without seeing an animal (usually see 2 about every 10 mins) which for a hunting sim is way too much.Warning calls are BS and should be taken out of the game. I feel like its the whole reason it seems like there is so much wildlife. you hear them EVERYWHERE! Yes you can turn the blips off but youre just putting yourself at a disadvantage doing so...No fun in that either.Tournies, truRAC and leaderboards need to be added ASAP if this game wants to survive aslong as TheHunter Classic has. Of course only after the major bugs are fixed!as of now this is my personal opinion rating, if you disagree dont feel afraid to comment.Gameplay 6/10Sorry its just to darn easy, tracking is useless, unless it shoot the animal you are aiming for and there is almost no bullet drop.Graphics 10/10Its ♥♥♥♥ing gorgeous guys, seriously looks amazing, other then some muddy leave textures every once and a whileSound 9/10All the sounds are amazingly well done, Wind, rain and thunder all at once kills your ears and is way too loud. also rabbits OP!If youre a hardcore hunting fan just stick to classic unless you have money to burn, until they release patches.I am still reccommending the game, ive loved all my time in it so far! there are just a lot of gameplay issues!*release review* feb 14thCOTW imho should be at minimum labeled as ""Early Access""there are some annoying UI bugs, ive crashed twice over the span of 12 hours, which really isnt bad.Ive had almost no issues with the game, other especially with AMD have it bad i hear.The Hunter Call of the Wild is, is a lot of fun and well worth the 35$ for me. but its far from finished, right now there is no tournaments, and leaderboards which really makes hunting sort of meaningless unless youre in a MP server where you can see other players top score.for 35$ it has more than enough content for me until the patches (hopefully tournaments) start rolling in.Nice physics, great graphics, runs crazyyyy smooth, honestly feels like it runs smoother than classic version. and not a god damn cashcow like classic aswell. if you want more content, then play classic but its going to cost you a hell of a lot more than this game will. I can see call of the wild being amazing if they do everything correctly.			"

												I am conflicted leaving this game a negative review. For what it is, the game is very beautiful and is very well detailed. When you first start it up you will be impressed with the surroundings and weapon graphics. The phone UI is a little whacky. In fact the UI in general is kind of weird.The AI is bad... really bad. When you first start, the game introduces you to tracking and killing an animal. This experience is pretty amazing. Then you go off doing ""quests"" and you realize that the open world AI is just flat out stupid. Animals walk into things. Deer literally keep coming back to the scene of the crime using the caller, until you murder their entire family. Getting into a hunting blind is cool... until literally everything becomes blind to you. I was calling for deer and a bear just walked up and stood there. Shot it in the neck for an instant kill and got a lot of XP.Sounds are amazing, for a while. You hear wind, walking through brush, rain, and trees all over along with the wildlife. But it gets repetitive and it can get really loud when you are trying to listen to things. When you hear the fog horn sound of a warning call, you will wake up the entire house with a feminine scream.All in all it's a cool game. But it is buggy and lacks real content. It's just a grind with a small variety of things to kill around you. I think this game could be amazing, and with some content and patches it probably will be, but for $30 I would just wait for a sale or some fixes. So my ""negative"" review is just one in waiting. I will pick this up again for sure when it goes on sale or a DLC comes out to fix and expand on things.			"

That bow is awesome at close range.Problems I have had ...when i bought the fox caller my scope went foggy on the 243....go figure.The fox caller sometimes sticks and you can not do anything  but call foxes...easy answer...back up a bit and select a gun. The fox caller will start to work again.Seems likes foxes spook at 38m...regardless of what you are doing....seems scent spray is required.Great game ( the graphisc are awesome) and hopefully the devs will take note of this .  Got to  level 10 and hopefully will go furtherCheersDave			"

												In the games current state, I do not recommend.theHunter: Call of the wild was a HUGE dissapointment to me. Coming from the classic ""theHunter"", beleive me when I say, I feel cheated and as if no effort was put into it. theHunter brought more diversity and unique opportunities than this game. I can only hope in the future they plan on adding more, as in, treestands, blinds, and water game. Also in the original theHunter something as simple as having a trophy count and trophy shot/picture brought more to the game than call of the wild has. The initial realease was a hot piece of garbage as the menu was broken, animals being stuck, spawn system way too high in areas, and etc.They turned this game into your average objective based game while taking away the uniqueness theHunter had to offer. Pros:GraphicsCons:No diversityNo trophy system or trophy shotGame still in beta after initial releaseNo effortNot a simulationMultiplayerI can see great potential for this game, but I hope they make the necessary additions to help improve.

												So i've not played that much yet, but i think i've played enough to give it a pretty fair review.The game is great, it takes everything from classic and improves upon it and removes those damned microtransactions.I had a blast playing and it was thrilling and very rewarding to track down a level 6 black bear... except for it wasn't and the bear was actually stuck in som foilage. The game is pretty buggy right now and when i finally found another black bear the UI glitched out and i couldn't get my rifle back after I had tried to switch to a new one. The devs really went all in with this game and it shows. The graphics are beautiful, the sounds are realistic and easy to distinguish from the ambience, and the voice acting is really good. Give this game a try and you wont get dissapointed. The devs will probably fix the current glitches soon, but even if they don't it's still a great game and you should try it.			"

As of this post I am level 15, 20+ hrs, Several Weapons and 100+ Animals down... Never played the OriginalFirst Impressions: I love it, great game, somewhat unfinished but everything these days is. A lot of people expect a finished game upon release which I find silly... Expectations of games in the modern day is insane, people think every game is a AAA title will hundreds of millions backing it. While the game isn't finished and many bugs are still out there it isn't game breaking and I have had no issues progressing. I had to adjust playstyle to accomodate bugs, mainly making too much sound while moving in any kind of stance (this includes the lower noise perks).I think give this game a little time and things will iron out, not all bugs are going to disappear but they will fix the major ones or at least I hope they do.Animals: The Animals are great, a huge range to shoot at and the bedding/feeding/drinking zones make finding a required animal a lot easier. The movement is pretty solid along with the animations of reactions to bullet fire or getting hit. I see a lot of people complaining about not being able to down a deer with the starter rifle and sorry to say but you are just a terrible shot. A heart or decent lung shot is going to drop a deer straight away if not a lung shot is going to have them run an extra 50m then die, anything else is just punishment for a terrible shot. Leading animals also appears to work well, more often then not I am able to get a 2nd or 3rd shot in before the animal is in cover or I have lost sight.Weapons: These are fine, I never played the original but having a background in FPS I am able to aim the rifle and hit my target at anything under 200m pretty easily. The 223 is a neat little fox hunting rifle which I have used on countless foxes including my 48,000,000 score kill (another bug). I have recently unlocked the 270 and it will drop pretty much any deer with a chest/shoulder shot. Progression on weapons is fine, its not too slow and definately not too fast. I would like to see more customization however this could happen in the future.Progression: Currently I am level 15 and it hasn't been a quick ride, having explored 80% of the map and killed over 100 animals it hasn't been easy. With that said I do like the progression, it isn't fast and I really have to work at it to get the unlocks I want. There is no quick level option in the game (that I know of) so doing what I am doing seems to be paying off in the long run. I also like how you have to progress with the weapon of choice, instead of just having a level requirement to shoot the best gun in the game. On that note by the time you unlock a better rifle you should be a better shot with rifles.Graphics: Amazing, running a 1070 makes this game look noice. Having played a few open world games now this does look amazing. From what I have heard from others this does look better then the original game which once again makes a lot of sense.Bugs: There is a few, a few really annoying ones which have turned away a few people I know.... That is fair enough and I respect that... However... Coming from Classic and expecting a polished game with the ability to just jump in and shoot whatever you want with whatever you want is not going to go down well.Overall: I would give it in its current state a 6/10 with the opportunity to hit 8/10 if the main bugs are fixed. I love how the game plays, how it looks and the progression. I love a challenge and having to really work for those quality kills, I will continue to play the game and looking to get some of those later unlocks.TL:DR - Overall great game for someone new to theHunter series, also for those looking for a hunter sim, different from Classic game, harder to bring those on Classic in current games state... Definately potential if bugs are corrected.			"

												This is a amazing hunting game, it has very good graphics and sounds , its playability is very smooth , the map is so huge it seems endless , you start off with a low end bolt acition rifle which is meant for small game but it is possible too take large game down but you need a vital hit and a lil bit of tracking it down , but dont worry you can buy better weapons in time the game has ingame money that you earn from your kills , exsploring ,quest, selling certing stufff to a npc you may find on your journeys (note this on selling i havnt got to that point in the game but i heard that you can from a quest) and you allso get a reward by turning in historical artifact im thinking its pretty rare to find them i only found 1 myself , ok by doing all those things you gain XP so that you can lvl up your hunter you will get points to use for passive and your active tree perks.. im not saying this game is 100% prefect but to me it worth every penny for the amazing open world map .

												The Game has potential, but in this state, its not ready for full release I would say.It needs a bit more work, and to fix some of the major issues:* The Menu UI has allot of problems, and crashes often, very difficult to use.* The game Only runs 60 FPS on 1080p.* Capped to 30 FPS on 1440p and 4K. :(* No option for any AA (Anti-aliasing) The feel of the Game is much like the previous Hunter Game, but now feels a bit warmer to the new players with the Tutorial in the beginning, and the added skill and leveling system.I will keep the game in my steam game library, and give the Devs some time to fix the major issues, and check back later.

												Let's get it out of the way first - the environmental audiovisuals of this game are absolutely astonishing. Possibly the most beautifully realised and naturalistic open game world I've ever seen.Unfortunately the artistry, technical prowess and obvious dedication that went into the game world simply don't extend to the gameplay and UI. Quite simply the game should not have been released in its current state as anything other than early access, and the devs would be receiving a lot more support and understanding if it had been.Currently Hunter CotW is a hunting game where you can't quite trust that the casualised hunting mechanics are coming together properly. Bagging or losing an animal because the game glitched out rather than through your own skills or lack thereof kind of defeats the whole purpose. Numerous crashes, bugs, design flaws and gameplay oversights just add additional salt to the wound. I'll give it a positive review because even as incomplete and bug ridden as it is, the immersion from wandering around its incredibly realised world (and occasionally shooting things) is unbeatable. It just has a long long way to go to be considered a finished product.			"

												Feel like pro hunter!!This hunting game absolutely sandbox and open world. Though there are some mission to boost your xp and cash, you are not forced to do that. You can traveling around the map and kill as many animals. 90% of this game is tracing the animals track. Lurking at their ""needs"" area, hit them, and track them then get the trophy. Get the exp to obtain new skills and weapon perks. There are still many room for improvement in this game like, weapon type, tools and gadget. Hope the dev often release new equipment and map. 9/10 for hunting game. Best hunting game i've ever played. Pro : - Stunning Graphic, environment and sound- Animal AI overall is good- HUGE MapCons :- Still many minor bugs like suddenly slow motion (not fps drop)- Animal stuck at tree - Lack choice of Weapon and Equipment- slow weapon/equipment change. it takes 4-5 seconds to change from rifle to binocular (not a fps drop) "

												We know why you are here. Lets just get this out of the way right now. This has some of the most beautiful environments I've ever seen in a game. If you love the outdoors as much as I, then you where probably equally pained throughout the Elder Scroll's laughable attempts at wilderness. Skyrim's best just wasn't real enough for me. It all looked... unnatural, as if someone who had never been outdoors looked at pictures. The great outdoors got that name for a reason. This game understands. Freaking. Gorgeous. I play on Ultra with a measly 8gigs of Ram, GTX 970 and an i5 6400. It runs great. If the optimization is buggy, I havn't noticed.Next up, if you like hunting games, your options are fairly limited. The Hunter Classic, Cabela's Hunts, maybe Hunting Unlimited if you can stomach the ancient graphics and mechanics. Now The Hunter Classic is a favorite of mine, despite my low play time, it rocked. I'm currently getting into Bowhunting IRL, and when I play these types of games, I'm looking at Bows only. Make of that what you will.The Hunter Classic had a variety of weapons, animals, and reserves. In comparison CotW, is pretty underwhelming. TWO BOW TYPES!? WHAT IS THIS HERESY!? Not even a recurve, or a longbow, or more compound... just a beginner compound and a high end. A real shame, as I really like variety and the challenge that a recurve provides. Same with Shotguns, hope you weren't looking for a large variety here. Seems the devs liked rifles more, and it reflects in the quests, some require super long range shots... which rules out bows and shotties. You get a paltry two reserves.... but they are pretty dang massive. I'd say they are equal to ... the alaskan one from the Hunter Classic in size. Lots of little things to find, and things to do. Shed Hunting, Feed ground spotting, camp finding, dozens of quests, Animal variety is ... fairly small in comparison to the hunter classic. I don't think the game has Grizzly, Wolves, or some of the varieties of Elk and Deer. I also didn't notice ANY waterfowl, or turkey. Although the ambient animals are significantly improved. Lots more birds, rabbits, squirrels ( I think that's what it was.. scared the alcohol right out of me.)So what about the important stuff? The actual hunting? Its superb. When it works. The game seems to have alot more wildlife than the Hunter Classic, so you are in the thick of it pretty much every step. Hit that caller and watch a group of four just wander in. Its probably not realistic, but it gets you into the hunt much quicker. ...now if you don't have any experience with hunting games, you probably will make the mistake of thinking that the .243 you start with is somehow effective at hunting.You would be wrong.The .243 modeled in this game and the Hunter Classic is a pea-shooter, that probably shouldn't be allowed on Deer, I have no experience with .243 in real life, but if you don't make a perfect shot, expect that deer to run for quite a ways. Its a beginner gun, do not expect them to drop with one shot unless you hit the sweet spot behind the front legs kinda near the knee. God help you if you take pot shots at a bear... like I did. 4-6 shots to put down a charging bear is not pretty. You ideally want to upgrade pretty much immediately. Men use bows, as our anscestors did. Real Men use Recurves as god intended, but the developers are clearly not as concerned as I. Point is, the beginner rifle will give you a bad impression if you are new to hunting. Stick with it. ... then get a bow. ;) Nothin like taking that perfect bow shot up close, and watching that buck drop....oh and this might as well be a beta for how buggy it is. I have numerous screenshots in my 3 hours of play of animals getting stuck on vegetation. Really the only bug I've found. If an incredibly annoying one. You spook an animal it will sometimes just fly right into a bush or tree and get stuck. The Hunter Classic had some great bug fixing, so I'm hoping this gets fixed. We shall see. Oh and the tutorial is absolutely terrible. If you are new too hunting, please for the love of god youtube some videos. Animals are smart. You have to be to get them. Calls, Stalking, Tree Stands, and an incredible amount of patience apply here.FINAL VERDICT TOO LONG DIDN'T READ: Lack of weapons. Lack of Reserves. Fantastic game, gorgeous environments, pretty buggy, so unless you LOVE to hunt (Like me.) I would wait for a sale. That being said, I HIGHLY reccomend this game if you are into the hunt.			"

												It is good fun, and will be a good hunting game once the bugs are ironed out.I am new to this type of game. To be honest I had my doubts, but I'm really enjoying myself. It is very slow paced, peaceful, relaxing. No triple-A FPS shooter where you lose interest after the first playthrough, It is a nice change of pace. One good thing is the developers actively support it. In 2,5 weeks there were 3 patches already. Despite its bugs i will recommend this to anyone who will not be bored by a lack of explosions and action every second around every corner. Think of this more of a simulation than game, although it could do with a bit more realism for my taste.It is like this: do you prefer Need For Speed/Burn Out or Project Cars/Assetto Corsa? You say yes to the latter, than this game could be for you.Having doubts because of the bugs? I recommend t wait a bit. The next patch is on its way and will be out according to the devs in short time.			"

Some of the walking sounds dont match the ground you walk on.Maybe the ability to walk slower with keyboard and mouse? Maybe a guide arrow that points in the dierection of the pin you place?also what are the random blue location markers?			"

												I like this game.  But let me start with the cons:Slowest walking simulator ever made.  They need to increase run speed by about 30%,  as, when you're traveling at running speed, you generally don't care if there is prey nearby that will run.  You're just trying to get where you're going.  And as there are no real ""save"" points, you always spawn at the last outpost you were at.  It can take forever to get from one place to another and it just takes tooooo lonnnng.   Maybe make it so you don't need to jump to get over fist-sized rocks when climbing uphill, while you're at it.  I shot a moose, which glitched out- shot it again, then again, at point blank, then it rand at lightspeed away into the distance.  F that moose.  At one point I jumped near a small waist-height tree and immediately died.  Game is buggier than a termite mound.  I wish you could save at any point, and start where you left off, or maybe have it autosave every 10-15 minutes in case the game crahes, instead of at your last outpost.  They're miles apart, and take forever to get back to, so if you do die jumping near a tiny tree, you're going to cry when you respawn miles away.Pros:Apex engine is beautiful.  If you have the gpu/cpu to rock this at ultra, it's stunning.  Audio is gorgeous as well,  it puts you right into it's world with all of the ambience you'd expect from a living forest.  Tracking and hunting remind me of Witcher 3 without all the Noonwraiths.  I've only been playing the Pacific NW-ish map, and I really like the mission-giving walkie-talkie guy.  It reminds me of firewatch, but not as linear, with no plot.   This is a great game to play when you're tired of getting smashed in the face in For Honor or need a break from anything competitive or serious.  It's calming, slow, and patient.  I have an i5 4670 and an R9 290, and can play this at 1440p with most settings at ultra but a few turned down.  Apex engine is beautiful - but demanding.  Another thing I wish they'd fix is the cost of items.  The progression system needs skin unlocks or something to motivate you while you save 30000 for that one rifle.  Plus skins are cool!  People love skins!Overall, there's a LOT to dislike, but TH:COTW still has somehow won me over.  There's a lot of heart in this game.  And a lot of shooting things in the heart, I suppose.  This will remain in my rotation as the game I play to chill after a stressful day.  Overall, recommended if you're looking for something different and don't mind early access (because that's what this really is, feels-wise).  If you have the cash, it's a fun diversion.  They've been steadily ironing out the bugs, and I look forward to future updates.			"

Another thing I wish they'd fix is the cost of items.  The progression system needs skin unlocks or something to motivate you while you save 30000 for that one rifle.  Plus skins are cool!  People love skins!Overall, there's a LOT to dislike, but TH:COTW still has somehow won me over.  There's a lot of heart in this game.  And a lot of shooting things in the heart, I suppose.  This will remain in my rotation as the game I play to chill after a stressful day.  Overall, recommended if you're looking for something different and don't mind early access (because that's what this really is, feels-wise).  If you have the cash, it's a fun diversion.  They've been steadily ironing out the bugs, and I look forward to future updates.			"

												Contrary to what my profile shows, I have more than 10 hours experience to back up my opinion of this game. I am not ashamed to admit that I bought this game today, and that I trialed it with an illegal copy of the game. Point is I've bought it now and at the time of writing this have tested it on version 1.11. I'm not even one to play many FPS games, let a alone an FPS game that simlulates hunting and as such requires you to be patient while moving veryyyyy slowly and cautiously so that you do not disturb your prey.  This is something new for me as a gamer who needs relatively paced gameplay with action at least every now and then. I was drawn in by this game's graphics presentation and this ultimately led me to try out the game. To my surprise, the gameplay also started to appeal to me after getting the hang of it and now I am convinced that this game deserves a try. If you like survival type games, rather come to this with a fresh perspective and you may enjoy theHunter for what it is and not for what it isn't. Also, there are several glitches that I have encountered but none were too detractive of the whole experience. My only gripe with this game so far is the inventory management system, which seems to bug out a lot depending on whether or not I am using KB/M or a controller at any given time. Devs, you have surpassed my expectations of this game, please fix these issues and more people will come to realise the potential of what you have made.			"

												the game is fun and addictive, the graphics are great, a little buggy at times. there is a few things that I would love to seeI would love if there was other forms of transportaition.It would be nice if the doe had its own bleet call instead of using the same call as a buck for the mating call. like in real life lol.The animal AI should act more normal. Some of the walking sounds dont match the ground you walk on.Maybe the ability to walk slower with keyboard and mouse? Maybe a guide arrow that points in the dierection of the pin you place?also what are the random blue location markers?			"

												Quick review since I only owned the hunter for a day or so.. Pros-Great graphics-Great sounds-Pretty Realistic hunting experience-Multiplayer with friends is quite fun-Decent price-Has Potential-Devs care about our comments and reviewsCons-Menu/Exiting or changing servers can be quite frustrating. Possibly just my menu bugging out-Some animals act very abnormally (Shoot a moose and it runs in circles at 60km/h)-Buggy animals such as.. after shooting a deer it stays standing and alive but it's really dead.. animals getting caught on trees while running and keep running in place.. Shooting something 10 times with the right caliber point blank but it just walks away as if nothing happened.So far that is what I have experienced, I don't regret buying the game but I feel that it was released a bit quick, I see it more as a beta with alot of potential. The bugs have not happened very often to me yet so i'll stay positive because I feel this game has much potential. "

												The game is overall pretty fun,Pros:-Absolutely beatiful graphics and very well optimized. -Very realistic in all aspects.-Good value for what you get.-I think if you like hunting you will like this game.Cons:-In 10 hours the only bugs I found were with the sound of the game, the normal sounds are always there, but when it's music, sometimes rain, or even when you use a deer caller, somehow the sound gets glitchy, the deer caller I can't even hear it most of the times. This sound glitches don't often occur (besides the animal callers), but it can still be annoying.I think it's wise to follow the patches of this game, if the sound is fixed, it becomes an extremely good game for those who like hunting or wilderness.

												I really like this game, I think it's a great hunting game and can be full of surprises and twists, like hunting a bear for a hour and it charges you from a under brush that's really cool, but what I HATE about this game is the ridiculous game breaking bugs that are abound everytime I log in. Such as not being able to switch to any guns or calls, tracks that are stupidly inaccurate and a stick pile that my friend got stuck on and died in (check my screenshots), oh and I almost forgot the crashes. But this game is promising and is fun if none of those things happen to you and I really hope the Devs get on this game and make it as best as it can be. (I reccomend because there is no middle ground option if there was I would put this review there)			"

												This game has lovely graphigs a few sound bugs that are easily fixeble. Runs at a smooth 60fps, It can get a bit stale with all the wainting and tracking can get frustrating. But when you finaly kill the animal you have stalked for so long it is so satisfying. I give this game a 7/10, I highly recomend it			"

												It's as step up from theHunter: Classic in some areas and a step back in others, however it's a good platform to build on like they did with Classic.Pros: - Updated graphics, some of the best scenery you will see in any game. - Hunting pressure, new mechanic to make it difficult to hunt in areas you've already hunted.- Improved animal behaviors. Animals will give warning calls, mating calls, and can be found in large heards.  There was also the addition of ""need zones"" that you can discover such as sleeping zones, drinking and feeding zones where you can find specific species at certain hours of the day.- Night hunting, with the help of a headlamp. - CoTW replaces a membership pay model of Classic with a RPG system that makes you gradually unlock new weapons and equipment through XP, also has a pretty neat skills/perks system that really adds some flavor to hunting. Cons: - Lacks the diversity of theHunter: Classic. Only 2 hunting reserves at the time of launch, a handful of weapons and a pretty small roster of game to hunt. - Scoring system seems wonky, not a huge fan of the ""consecutive harvests"" idea. The game awards senseless killing and not being patient and selective like it should be. - Small features like trophy shots and trophy galleries not available at this time. Guessing in the future? Not sure why something like this would be cut from the game.- Performance issues, some people complaining about crashes/bugs. Latest patch addressed some issues though.-  No mobile tree stands, or tents. You have to discover outposts around the map and use them to fast travel.			"

												The most beautiful environment i've ever seen.. NOTE: This is the only review i've written on steam since i've found no game really in need of it.I started playing the old hunter game as an escape with one of my friends and it was all right but this one is one of the best games i've played. It's so relaxing so stroll around without any competition tracking down your prey and then taking a well prepared shot. The two maps that are available are huge and has by far the most beautiful scenery and environment that i've ever seen. Walking around the huge maps really takes your mind of everything in life, add some calm music and i'm in total bliss. The sounds made for this game are amazing and it's so much so that you might for a second actually believe that you're in whatever forest or field that you're currently tracking prey in. The game is so calm, the only thing that disturbs the peace is your bullet leaving the muzzle.I found this game awesome to play with a friends and ganging up on some resting bear that just happens to get shot 5-10 times it's just friggin' hilarious and also brings time to talk about other stuff that might not even be related to the game. Now on to the bad parts, the game in single player for me is running flawlessly on my setup and i have no issues at all really except for some minor bugs that won't really affect the experience.On the other hand, multi player is riddled with small bugs that actually stack up, one of my friends game crashes all the time whilst mine doesn't and i have almost the same setup as him. The mission system doesn't work in multi player, menu's will click without any warning and i have accidentally kicked friends from the multi player game by accident because of this. If you're the host you can still locate landmarks/cabins and get the experience and lore from interacting with them, BUT your friends that are clients on the server can't which hinders the experience on their part since they can't progress in the game world when they play on your servers. But this isn't really a problem if you switch between host/client from time to time. You're usually not even concerned by this since you always get sidetracked by prey.I can wholeheartedly recommend this game for those with patience with some minor bugs. I would agree that this game should still be in a Beta stage. But it is so immersive that i'm glad that i can take part in it right now.If you're constantly annoyed by bugs and can't let go. Then this game might not be for you right now. "

												Excellent hunting simulator... For the most part. Real hunting involves patience, and so does the hunting in theHunter: CotW. But that patience also has to be extended to the acquisition of all the gear, which requires a great deal of grinding to eventually access. Also, unfortunately, the game does have a few UI and menu bugs(like changing the FOV back to default after alt tabbing). But overall, I find it to be a relatively challenging and engaging hunting sim, with possibly the mosts realistic foliage I've ever seen, and it's always satisfying when you land that perfect vital shot into your quarry's heart. If you have patience, you will love this game. Otherwise, probably not.			"

Also, being a bow hunter I was disappointed to not have the option to use a bow from the start. 2.7 hours in, 3 doe down, and I'm still not able to unlock the bow.

												I don't understand as to why people are giving this negative review's. It's a really good looking game with really good gameplay. Better than other hunting games I have ever played.I just wonder what's the future of the game in term's of more weapon's, and other feature's. I hope they add thing's like ATV's and other offroad vehicles along with more maps that are bigger too. Aside from that the game is a worth a buy and is really gorgeous.--------edit review------------Ok so now I ran into some bugs, that being animals getting stuck on random terrain and weird spawn issues with deer. I came up on a hill and found like literally 15 fallow deer all just in one place and cant move. I went up close enough to actually be able to pet them. On the plus side, they look good. So far these issues seem to be something that is fixable in the near future.....but the forums don't allow us to post subjects. So this is a serious problem with communication.			"

												This review is for solo play only, I haven't tried online play yet.  The game feels like early access (particularly because of the UI being unresponsive at times) but it is in a highly playable state at the moment. I've spent 5 hours so far, and I've enjoyed the title. Other than the UI occaisonally taking two clicks instead of one I've only seen one bug, A deer was stuck in a tree trying to run away. Not exactly the end of the world, as you see similar pathing errors pop up in Bethesda games. The environment is very well rendered, effects like tall grass getting stomped down as you walk through a field were a nice touch. Probably one of the most relaxing games involving shooting I've ever played. Provided support and development continues, this is well worth picking up. Particularly if you enjoyed the original 'TheHunter' but were put off by microtransactions. Wait if you're worried about the title being dropped, otherwise give it a go.			"

												**DISCLAIMER** This is NOT going to be a serious, well structure review so if that is something you are looking for then you are better off scrolling on.Call of the wild is my first real hunter game I've gotten into, I dabbled in the free to play version but once you realise how much of a sting all the micro-transations are then it can be an instant turn off for loads of people, including myself. But then this beauty comes along, a one time payment, everything in the game is unlocked and available to use (Outside of the ingame currency earned) and there is room for DLC in the future. I really hope they don't take the mick with it though.Gameplay wise I find it very pleasing, tailing and calling in prey to be shot is really satisfying, especially if the kill is a beauty. Patience is a virtue in this game thats for sure.Graphically it is stunning, you can check my profile for some of the screen shots but this game really has some stunning moments in the game, all made available to capture through the ingame camera (for added feels). If it isn't the wildlife that grabs your attention it is the landscape!A few bugs I've noticed so far is sometimes the hitscan seems way off, I'll aim for the vital organs but when I claim the trophy ive shot right up the poop shaute.. Another is that the callers seem to bug and wont go off when used. I'm unsure if this is an audio thing or if it actually doesn't work in game when the item is used. Lastly I've had a really rare bug where I can't toggle to other eequipment. It isn't holdstered and the symbol in the bottom right will change but the character won't take out the respective equipment nor is it able to be used.Overall I love this game, and I am sure to have many more hours! As mentioned I just hope DLC isn't something that takes the mick over time.. Last thing steam needs is another Train Simulator DLC mockery!			"

												+10 hours since release and im enjoying the game so far. I havent tried the multiplayer yet so this is going to be mostly a single player focused review. For starters the game launched pretty sloppy for many, including my self, and many of the issues are still prevelent such as graphical glitches, crashes, and AI issues, sound issues. Since launch the game has felt like a unpolished beta rushed to meet a release deadline.The game over all plays pretty well for those who are a fan of The Hunter and already know what to expect. For new comers to the series It might be the only start to The Hunter they can enjoy since Classic has more of a F2P/P2W business model behind it and isnt very welcoming to new players since they are locked out of 95% of the great content in the game. If you are new to the series i would recommend picking this game up over playing classic first, if you are not a new commer to the The Hunter you might find this game a tad bit lacking in terms of equipment and features (dogs, tents, stands, tripods, scents, callers, birds, ducks, geese, blinds) so it wont fill those voids if you've enjoyed +100 hours with those features in your hunts. The game offers two reserves to hunt on and a wide array of equipment to use and animals to track and spot, Every animnal you harvest is awarded with XP and cash based on the difficulty of the animal, the weapon used and the shot placement and whether or not the animal died instantly or bled out over time. New features to the game are the new stealth mechanic, sight and sound now play an important factor as well as smell, the noob friendly meters on the HUD will show you how visible or how noisy you are in the environment, i found that the controller utilized these features better than traditional K/M. Progression in The Hunter is very different from other games and very time consuming, and given the unpredictiblity of many animals the game does not reward simple tasks and you will find yourself grinding or side tracked many times. A few new features to the game are ""need zones"", areas where animals migrate or congregate based on there needs at that specific time of day. NIght time hunting is also a new feature, hunting at night is alot more challenging than during the day you will find yourself wandering the game world following tracks since animals are usually quieter during the night. The new features in CofW are refreshing and a good reason to pick the game up if you like simulation or hunting games. Over all the core elements play well.  The game ran fine on a single Zotac GTX 980 on ultra for the most part with a Gsync display and Vsync turned on for many hours on end so its not a very demanding game if youve still got an older gen card in your machine. I have yet to test the game in SLi but for the most part it runs well without SLi.In review, The Hunter CotW is essentialy a bare bones experience of The hunter classic with an updated game engine and graphics and some unique gameplay features. I can see this game being polished and packaged really well in the future with a handful of updates and DLCs but for now you will only be getting a fraction of what The Hunter Classic has to offer currently.Graphics: 8/10Gameplay:7/10Features:7/10Content:6/10Over all: 7/10A solid game for sim lovers and hunters alike.

												Me and the family decided to take a camping trip but after buying this, I told my wife to take a friend. Btw ppl stop being so lazy, the whole point in hunting is it takes time like fishing, you can't just run through the forest hoping to spot one, take it easy walk slow watch your sounds.  Only bugs I've noticed are when pulling up the map, sometimes you get big letters but it fixes fast and I have seen 1 deer get stuck on a rock. Over all this is best tracking and hunting experience in a game so far.			"

												Very good hunting sim/game,it grows on you,give it time to get the most from it you won't be unlocking all the guns on day one,if you have a good pc you will enjoy.Yes there are a few bugs as others have said but not a deal breaker and im sure they will patch them,its a one time buy with more DLC to come.The wild life looks and sounds real and so do the guns.

												The gameplay is super fun and beautiful.  Unfortunately, this game has too many bugs to count.  For me, the bugs don't affect gameplay, but my friend has to completely restart his computer every time he wants to play for some reason.  However, this game is much better than the first game (theHunter) that was almost 100% pay to win.			"

												TL:DR - Its the most beautiful game you will ever see. The screenshots barely do it justice. Gameplay is pretty good, just what you'd expect from a hunting game. Multiplayer is very fun and easy to get into.-------------------------------------------Hands down, without question, THE MOST jaw-droppingly gorgeous game I have ever played. Turn your graphics up, your sound up, headphones on and just close your eyes. Its amazing. I moved out from the shadow of a tree into the sunlight and I would swear to you, I felt my arm get warm. THAT'S what kind of immersion this game delivers. You are going to walk around, ALOT. But once you come across the huts, you can resupply and fast travel between any you've unlocked. Hunting feels rewarding and frustrating at the same time. You need to move slowly, keeping an eye on your sound levels, but its only natural to want to ""hurry up"" and catch your prey. I found that after hearing an animal call out, it was easier to take up a good position, use my caller and wait for it to come to me. Multiplayer is very easy to get into and the fact that its up to 8 player co-op is pretty awesome. You can team up or go your own seperate ways and hunt ""alone."" You can even issue challenges and compete against one another. The mechanics themselves can be a big grindy. You need to make sure you try your best to take down your target with one hit so that it goes down quick and clean. You're pay for the kill will change depending on those parameters. It definitely takes awhile to unlock the weapons but everything is available ingame, no micro transactions.Shooting feels pretty good. Once you kill your animal and track it down (if you dont kill it outright) you can actually see where the bullet entered, what body parts it hit etc etc. Overall, I recommend it. Its absolutely gorgeous, 9/10 "

												After read so much evalutions and the developer replies, I decide to buy this game base on the actively developer communication. Most reviews had focused on the BUG and crashe problems so far, I hople that further updates could make this a  better game. Looking forward to edit my reply after hours of gaming time.------------------------------------------------------------------------------The first two hours of game: the first two animals I got was two female deers which was stick into trees and I walk to the in front of the deers and then aim, shoot.-----what a newbie treating!The third animal I got was a bear! I was little bit of scared of the first time hunting this big and wild beast! I aimed from 20M far, I was too afraid to get any closer. Left mouse cliking, I got her. Then the gaint wild beats stick into a rock and yet keep running away from my bloody gun. I walked into the bear slowly and give her more shoots-------what a newbie treating!------------------------------------------------------------------------------Keep looking forward to edit my reply aft more gaming time.

Makes one recall the time spent playing Deer Hunter 2004 in their childhood.Didn't really like the previous theHunter games as they were free but required microtransactions for anything to be accomplished, but thankfully there isn't a single one in this game. Everything is earned in the gameplay itself, which is bloody marvellous.Another plus one such as myself appreciates greatly is the single-player (there is an option for multiplayer), which as the name would suggest doesn't require internet to play. It's great for us Australians stuck with less than 50kb/s internet on peak. The story on campaign is fairly neat too, thus far.For the price it's currently at (AUD$40), I'd consider it worth it. If it's on sale, I'd highly reccommend grabbing it. Consider the game for it's graphics alone if hunting isn't your thing.			"

												The game is good.Pro'sAmazing Hunting reserves - Album for reference ( http://imgur.com/a/bo4jY )Major improvements over that of theHunter (often refered to as theHunter: Classic)The game give's a very informative UI display during your hunt.The Huntermate in the game isn't required for use in collecting and harvesting animals.Day and Night Cycle - to allow for any time of day hunting.Nice assortment of weapons for Hunting with a Rifle.Con'sIn game Economy needs alot of work (Not properly balanced)Items requires skill's or Certain Level to unlock in the StoreFew Animation GlitchesSkill tree for items needs to be resorted by the developers.Slow Progressions - Money, Skills, PerksAmmo is locked behind a Skill level to get different types.Till you progress enough in the skill's for weapons, your stuck hunting small game or attempt to hunt large game with equipment rated for small game, in the first week of game play.Exclusive Equipment requires Always online with steam for use.To unlock fast travel on the map you have to explore the entire map for all its outposts.The game is amazing it's got enough there to keep you busy for a long time, but the Dev's are still working to rebalance the game. I would recommend this title based on the reason the Dev's are working to correct all the errors with the game.If you would like to see a Sample of my gameplay  have a Series hosted on youtube (un-edited)https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI2m3FezFJ3ozUFbeKHVay7PwDqlfcqtAThe animal hunt is Fun and challenging, I welcome it better then I do any other hunting game, but understand I say if your looking to getting this game; It still needs some polish.

												Pros:-Beautiful game-Large Reserves that are very immersive-Levelling and Story line-12 varied species with different ai -No subscription model-No micro transactions -30$ base game-Potential for may awesome expansionsCons-Poor menu layout throughout, the store is tough to navigate. When I first started I did not know how to jump between hunting reserves for example (Maybe explained later in the story i dont know)-The bugs. Runs smoothly on my pc but there are bugs and glitches have yet to have a crash- Horrid score sheet. Seeing the 3d skeleton is cool but there was something about those old Boone and Crocket score cards that was pretty freaking cool.-Lack of trophy shot system, This feature was so cool in the Hunter classic it would be awesome to have it back.-No real trophy room or way to revisit old hunts or show off to friends. The persistance of theHunter classic was kick ♥♥♥.Bottom line is the game has great potential depending on where EW takes it. Hopefully it doesnt turn into a Money pit like theHunter classic. Great value for 30$Top priorities for the devs.1. Bug Squashing2. Ui Tweaking3. Make the hunts mean something bring back score cards and trophy shots.4. Meaty Dlc/Expansions- I will have no problem spending 20$ to get a well thought out reserve with 5-6 animals and a few new weapons and itmes. "

												Wow what an utter disappointment! The game was over-hyped and obviously rushed out in incomplete state. Numerous game breaking bugs and constant crashes everywhere! No matter how good it looks this is actually a downgrade from The Hunter Classic in terms of hunting experience. The Hunter CotW feels arcadey at best. no Trophy shots or display of any sort. Antler system is non-existant meaning you have dozens of deer clones running around, getting stuck in mid air...What an utter fail of a game launch. Out there with Arkham Knight dissaster for me!Refunding until the game is fixed!			"

												Over 40 hours on record. Still plenty of things to do.That's a good start for a review! :)So first of all, you need a pretty powerful machine to have this monster of a game run without crashes. I'm using an i7-7700 with a GeForce 1060 and 16 GB of Ram. Game crashed only once since I got it, which was after 6 hours of play and on patch 1.1, so a long time ago.The 2 reserves are amazingly detailed, and with patch 1.3, 4 and 5 the hunting part became more accessible. This feels great and immersive, and I have friends getting new computer equipment just to play this.Finding the outposts is one part of the game, which will get you on the road for quite some time. Outposts are still (unfortunately) the only way to fast travel, so to complete your missions, you will need them. Just finding one might get you more than 15+ minutes, especially without using cheat maps and going by all the lookout stations.The game, the animal tracking (dead rabbits to follow when going after coyotes since 1.5! Yeeah!), the shooting, rifles and bows, it's all good....Could use more animals to shoot...Ducks, Geese...Meh, even fishing could be cool in there...Enoy this version as much as possible, because I don't think the console version coming up has any chances to deliver.A good and solid 8 out of 10.

												I figured I would write a review solely base upon the mixed ratings.- This game definitely has it's bugs, but none of them have been absolutely game-breaking.- Expansive Worlds has made a step in the right, non-greedy direction.- You'll want a fairly beefy computer, but performance isn't as bad as some people make it out to be. (I'm getting 60 FPS on average, with the occasional drop to 50. Specs on my Profile)- Graphics are seriously phenominal. The game really looks like the screenshots. I haven't played a game of such large scale that manages to accomplish as much detail as this game.- Some story-mode/quest missions available that give the game a little more direction and challenge.If you want the game, I would recommend it.

												First off, to explain why I recommend this game:If you have been waiting for a hunting game to relive the old times like back in Deer Hunter 2005, this may just be it. However, if you are invested in theHunter Classic and have played that, you may want to stick with that for a while.As many have said, this game feels like a Beta title. The bugs are there, and while I haven't had anything game-breaking, they are still there. First, this game is beautiful. Just walking around, taking in the sights is a great experience that I find extremely relaxing.But, I have a few small gripes with the game in my playtime so far. For one, I feel like the animal AI is strange. The deer move at such a rapid pace, and trot around way more often than I believe is realistic. Even in the Hunter classic the deer were more docile and seemed to behave more realistic than this. I feel like tracking a deer is extremely difficult if not impossible. Granted, it should not be easy, but I feel like they just move too fast for you to effectively keep up.The noise mechanic is a nice feature of this game. However, I feel that the player character moves way too fast and makes too much noise. Sure, you must be careful and walk slowly, but I feel that crouch-walking the entire time is just not realistic/feasible. In real life, I can walk more carefully and tread lightly when needed. I know there are perks that can reduce walking noise, but it makes it hard to even kill anything and get to level up to get those skills. And then, since you have to crouch walk, you either cannot see the animals you are searching for, or you cannot keep up with a trail as the deer are moving away.I'm not saying we need slow moving, deaf zombie deer, but I think it still needs a little work.Now, I still recommend this game. I'm not a Hunter Classic player myself, but seeing how the devs have stuck with that game for so long gives me hope that they plan for this one to be around for a while too. I know tHuner Classic's subscription model might have been why they stuck with it for so long, so we will have to see. I do still have hope that they will fix this game and make it much better. The Hunter Classic 7 years ago would be laughable compared to what it is today. Let's hope they apply that work ethic to this title as well.If you're looking for a solid hunting game, that you can pay once for and get a full game, then I think this is your game... Once all of the wrinkles have been ironed out. But, if you're like me and just can't wait to jump in and scratch that hunting itch, then go for it! I will update this review as time goes on to see how well the devs keep up and fix the game, hopefully making it better!			"

												Not really. Can look amazing at times, then flat and boring at others. Performance is average to OK. I have a i7 6700k and a GTX 1070 and 16GB DDR4 and I get mostly around 55 fps on Ultra/high settings. A lot of my kills so far have been animals stuck in rocks and trees, one had even buired its head inside of a mountain side. Menus seem glitchy and I have had to restart once so far. The AA is pretty shocking and I'm using rehade to try fix it but things are still very pixalated. Fix the AA and blurrness and the game would look far better! As far as I can tell there are no leaderboards or comps or tropthy rooms, which is very strange and a wasted opportunity. The screenshots on the store page are in-game but are touched up to not look to blurry or jaggy. Needs a lot of work, and should of been a early access game.			"

It IS playable, just some bugs here and there, but it is somewhat arcade style atm. Im sure this is subject to change later on.5. Have a good PC.

												This should have been an easy recommendation. A lighter, better looking, more polished version of a great hunting game I've been enjoying for years. At first it seemed that's exactly what it was, but further playing revealed that the stealth system is totally busted, making it nearly impossible to stalk something using a keyboard. Prone movement on totally open grass should not be scaring deer into running off when they're over 100 meters away. Making as slow of movements as you can, avoiding foliage even, should not cause you to make the maximum amount of noise possible. Yet this is exactly what happens, all the time.If this problem is fixed, I'd love to revisit the game, but as it is now, it's just fundamentally broken.			"

												When it works it's great, huge maps, great graphics. However, the current state of the game is game breakingly buggy. The menu screens have memory leaks for some, the inventory screens don't work, freeze, and don't transfer items for a lot of people. As of right now, with almost 6 hours into my save, the inventory system has locked all of the ammo into storage, and since it's bugged out and I can't retrieve it, it's effectively made it impossible for my to play any longer without starting a new save game.I like the game a lot so far overall, but until the bugs are all fixed I highly recommend holding off on purchasing this. Give it a month or so.			"

												Waited a long time for this game and fortunately it turned out to be everything I hoped it would be. There are some bugs and issues, but none have been in any way gamebreaking for me. The important stuff works.So here's some of the things that are great:- The visuals and sounds are gorgeous in every way and there's nice variety in locations.- The chase gives you the same kind of thrills as when you go hunting for real.- Tracking is done properly and is quite enjoyable.- Player movement and gunplay is spot on.- The statistics info on the harvested animal is done properly.Some small things that still need some improvement:- The menu and keybinds have some problems- Gear needs a lot more variety, since now there's only a fraction of the items from the original. But I guess that's the DLC plan...- Sneaking feels a bit dodgy and the vagueness of the movement sound UI doesn't help. Makes it a lot more difficult to track wounded animals.- The animal AI sometimes does funny things like gets stuck on things.- Freaked out wounded animals run around way too fast compared to the real thing.- It feels like the bleeding mechanic also needs a bit of tweaking. If you miss all the critical target hitboxes, the animal always bleeds at the ""Very low"" bleed rate, even with clear head- or gut shots. Also, wounds bleed more if you run, so running speed should affect the bleed rate.- I would prefer vehicles (or a horse) over fast travel any day.Conclusion: A very enjoyable hunting game and I expect it only to get better.

												Shot a fallow deer 5 times, tracked it for over 1 real time hour, game crashed before I found it. 10/10 too much waterEDIT:TL;DR - Enjoyable, feels like a beta but very pretty with an iffy interface, less of a hunting game and more an animal shooting game. Bows are OP. No microtransactions.After putting more time into this, I feel I can write a proper and serious review. At the time of writing, this game functions like beta. That said, despite being riddled with bugs and occasional crashes (though your mileage may vary on bugginess) this game is a graphically superb and worthy sibling to theHunter Classic, and I don't regret my purchase. My only major complaint is that they somehow managed to be less realistic in this game than Classic with both the general feel of the game and with animal behaviors - I feel I can describe it best in the way that Diablo 3 is not a dungeon crawler like D2, but a very large loot run. Similarly, you are placed in the vast reserve (and I do mean vast, the maps are colossal) with free reign over a never-ending hunt. It doesn't feel like hunting to me, it feels like animal shooting. Veterans of theHunter Classic (or even other hunting games, I suppose) might understand better than someone fresh to the genre. Animals, particularly female deer, are still dumb as walking rocks with the added bonus of sometimes running you over on accident in their zeal to be the first to stand as close to you as possible. Bright side? They don't seem to magnetize toward you anymore - they go where the call was and stick around the immediate area. You're free to sprint like a madman with (seemingly) little consequence. In fact, it seems rewarding by the warning calls provided by animals, alerting you to their rough location. Just crouch and spam your callers. Move toward them for increased efficiency. Animals also seem to be very nonchalant about gunfire, even within ranges where they would probably reasonably hear it. They also seem to not mind returning to the same area where you butchered several herd members already. That said - the hunting pressure system seems to mostly work. Animals outside the group (if there was one) you killed from are very unlikely to enter the area when attracted to calls or scents. They do, on occasion, wander through to get somewhere else, though.So far, weapons handle reasonably well and have satisfying sounds and animations, though I personally find the kick-up of recoil to sometimes be laughably extreme as an avid hunter in real life. The .243 is not as woefully pathetic as in Classic, and will absolutely do the work you need it to (until you can get the .270. Get it.). However, I recommend polymer tip bullets when available. They are a pleasant step up from the standard soft points, but certainly not a critical upgrade. Bows, however, seem grossly overpowered at the moment. Flesh wounds will have deer bleeding out in times comparable to decent rifle shots.The interface is a bit cumbersome and lacks information (e.g. current weapon scores outside of the shop, experience until next level, return to main menu button) that I would like to have access to, although this is more of a personal gripe than a point against the game. Most of the nitpicky issues I have with menus and interface are personal beyond being unrefined. The map also has the tendency to find itself focused on anywhere except where you are when opened.If I sound harsh on this game, it's not because these are glaring faults that should dissuade you from buying. This is a good game for the state it's in, but realize that it does have issues. I can recommend this to veterans of Classic that want a more streamlined and immediate hunting experience without fussing through menus and launchers or simply want to support Avalanche and Expansive Worlds. It's more of theHunter, what can I say? If you're on the fence or new to this series, perhaps stick with Classic until this game is fleshed out more.			"

												I'll try to be as fair as possible with this.The Good1- Amazing graphics and great optimization. Even with my rig that was built in 2011 (GPU upgraded since then to 970), I can run the game on max settings and still get 40+ fps.2- The sounds. Everything is crisp and authentic. The ambient life is especially well done with a staggering array ranging from crickets to different birds like loons and kill dear (it's a bird). I especially love the wind through the trees sounds. It makes me feel like I'm at home and the rain sounds are good but lack a bit of beef.3- Tracking is pretty fun and an added bonus here is that you can turn off all visual tracking aids if you're feeling particularly masochistic. I nearly couldn't find a coyote in a bed of flowers even with the aids on.4- MASSIVE maps. You may only get two of them for now but these things can take you over 2 hours to walk from one end to the other. These are beautiful environments.The Bad1- Volume. Some sounds are just totally out of whack volume wise. Heaven forbid you get within 50 yards of a rabbit because if you do your ears will be graped with what sounds like dragging something across a gravel road. Walking through water is excessively loud as well.2- The UI. Repeatedly have to hit some buttons to navigate the menu. It's a pain in the bunghole to deal with.3- The map. The stupid thing opens to a random point and zoom level every time you open it and it's as stupid as can possibly be. Sometimes it opens zoomed out all the way. Sometimes zoomed in all the way and nowehere near your current point. Obvious bug I expect to be fixed sooner than later because it's so ♥♥♥♥♥ irritating so I'm not terribly worried about it but it needed mentioned.4- ""Nothing to do"". This is extremely important because right now the only goals in the game are to level up and spend skills and perks to unlock abilities you should have because realism. There is no trophy system that I can find. No way to go back and relive past kills or have trophies to look at. The only point of the game right now is to use your weapon more to unlock the next weapon and kill more things to get more money to buy the weapon. What does this mean? It means the game is a kill fest. There's no limit to the number of animals you can take home to feed the kids so you end up just killing everything that moves because you need the weapon skill to unlock the next weapon and you need the money to buy it. I once let a doe go because I had just gotten done killing 5 does. After it walked off I asked myself why I let it go. There is no reason whatsoever to let anything in this game live.5-Being harder to see in fog and rain are actually skills you must unlock in this game which reaches maximum potato levels. Sorry but you don't need training to be harder to see in these atmospheric conditions. Fix it.6- Wind only sometimes masks your sound.7- Rain never masks your sound.8- Kill data diagram is badly implemented. I'm talking about the xray image of the animal you shot with bullet penetration data. It's all blue and white so the whole thing ends up getting washed out and it's hard to see where anything is at. I definitely can tell where the lungs are at, but where is the heart? I don't know I can't see it because it's all white.9- Sometimes fall damage. Sometimes not. Just slid down the side of a mountain at top speed taking no damage and then it launched me off near the base and I flew forward like 100 yards and fell like 50 yards and didn't take a single bit of damage. Wat?10- Fog. Everywhere there's fog. News flash! The sun burns the fog away by mid morning. I shouldn't be walking around through a hazy wood at noon, especially with wind. Your light shafts and god rays are beautiful but cmon guys.11- There shouldn't be animal noises during heavy rain/wind storms. 12- No blood spray/spurt from animal upon shooting. No gutting the animal. No bullet hole or blood on animal despite spraying 1 gallon of blood out of its lung. I consider this a mortal sin at this point considering how realistic everything else is.13- You don't exist. When you wipe your phone your hand moves so far forward that you can see where it disappears. You are a floating pair of hands and that is also why you commit the greatest mortal sin in this entire game. YOU CAST NO SHADOWS. This is ridiculous. As tragic as loading up a $60 AAA title and realizing that mirrors don't have reflections. Also, being in environment shadows does not affect your visibility and neither does night time.The Neutral1- No bullet time. I know I know....not realistic. But I love bullet time and I've been spoiled with it from other games for years. Would be fun to have especially considering the only point of this game is to kill everything that moves whether or not you would take that animal in real life.Am I enjoying this game? You bet! But there is so much wrong with it that I couldn't in good conscious tell a buddy hey you should get this. Some of the bugs are rage enducing. Some of the features make me seethe. No blood or wound on the animals is as stupid as doing a hand stand and farting even though you have diarrhea.I have high hopes for this game and will continue to get high and have a super relaxing time playing it but just be warned about the negatives because in my opinion they far outweigh the positives at this point.

												I've been watching this game since it went into Beta. The graphics look great, but the developers just fall short on the basics...- 3440x1440 has message boxes showing up off screen. Only the edges can be seen, while all of the text and general data is offscreen. Making it much harder to tell what is going on in game. Wide screen and custom resolutions are just basic functionality that should simply work on ANY PC game. If you don't support custom or at least standard resolutions, then you can't really call yourself a PC game in my opinion.- Going prone on an incline causes a graphical glitch allowing you to see through the world. How did this ever make it through both QA and Beta? This is another bug dealing with basic functinality. How do you produce a game that allows for prone and crawling and never once notice the clipping? Either that or they were simply too incompetent to fix it, neither of which is a good sign.- AI got stuck in the water. Two deer were walking in the water and just got stuck on nothing. While this bug is a little more forgivable given that these types of bugs generally require very specific locations/actions, on top of other basic functionality it all just points to Devs who either don't care about the quality of the game, or who are too incompetent to ensure the quality of the game. In either case I do not recommend buying it, though I will say it looks beautiful when it isn't glitching out.			"

												First game I have ever refunded.  Tracking Simulator 2017. I am a seasoned hunting game player, but this game needs some tweaks.  Spent over an hour tracking a deer I shot in the chest.  Went in a 1 mile circle crouching, going 1 mph upwind and then the tracks started overlapping.  Waste of time.  Deer should have died within 100 yards.  Has potential, but no thanks.			"

												When it works it's great, huge maps, great graphics. However, the current state of the game is game breakingly buggy. The menu screens have memory leaks for some, the inventory screens don't work, freeze, and don't transfer items for a lot of people. As of right now, with almost 6 hours into my save, the inventory system has locked all of the ammo into storage, and since it's bugged out and I can't retrieve it, it's effectively made it impossible for my to play any longer without starting a new save game.I like the game a lot so far overall, but until the bugs are all fixed I highly recommend holding off on purchasing this. Give it a month or so.			"

												I was excited for this game, but it has been a huge let down.Reasons to not buy this game/delay your purchase until patches are released:- Terrible optimization (I have a powerful PC, even on the lowest settings it isn't great. I currently use a R9 390 so Gameworks is suspected to be the issue, no surprise there)- Game breaking bugs (spawning outside of the map, spawning under the map, being stuck on the world screen)- Buggy menus (half the time menu category buttons do nothing when clicked)- Broken sound (any items I use including the rifle make no sound at all, even when the world ambience is working fine)- Clunky animations (e.g. when reloading the right arm of the player model has a muscle spasm)I'm sure after a few updates these issues will be resolved, but releasing a product in a state like this shows that the Avalanche hasn't given Expansive enough time to release a functional game. Will update this review when the game has improved.			"

												I like it! Alot, actually. I haven't had any of the notorious crashes or bugs everybody's been talking about so far. Being an avid bowhunter our in the real world, there's alot in this game for me to like. So, let's get into it:Pros:-None of that monthly payment crap they did with theHunter classic, which I never played because of that.-Gorgeous game, period. -Good animal models.-So far, I like the animal behavior. It seems realistic enough.-The needs areas. It's about as realistic as you can get to areas where animals bed down and where large water sources are.-The hunting pressure system. Finally, a game does it. If you hunt out of one area all the time you're never going to find anything in there because it's all been chased out.-Realistic scent and sound mechanics. Keep an eye on the wind and watch your step. Keep your ears open for calls.-The sheer amount of space available to you. The reserves are large, to say the least.-It's ****ing hunting!Cons:-It doesn't say it's in early access, but it pretty much is. The lack of content shows, mostly in the weapons department. The game could use birds and more big game, too. -No traditional bows. I've used compounds all the way up to longbows. I use a recurve during the bow season, so the fact that it's isn't in the game bothers me. The compounds will have to do for now. -Bleed outs. The fact that the feature exists at all is excellent. However, they bleed out way too quickly. I get that it's a shot to the vitals, but they aren't going to run a hundred yards and just drop. They hole up and lay down, pretty much waiting until they die. Granted, it depends on how badly they've been shot, bow or rifle, but right now the distance run by the animals after the shot seems rushed and artificial. I can't speak for the bugs, because I haven't seen any yet, truth be told, but I like what I've played so far.Definitely a recommend from me.			"

												If your a REAL hunter or know how to hunt, this game is highly recommended.If you know nothing about hunting except that you got a gun and you have to shoot to kill an animal... Pass your way, Its not for you.Many people complain that this game is hard while they keep on running everywhere, so avoid using those reviews to made your descision.Pros: - Huge map, lots of hunting spot- Animal AI is pretty good (Simply need some adjustement, for now, they are too easy to aproach)- 2 huge map really beautifull- Couple of weapons, Riffle, Bow, Shotgun, Pistol (many of each)- Good variety of animal to hunt (They will probably add even more in the futur)- You can play with different play style, from tracking to waiting in a watch and calling for your big trophie- Devs work hard to fix bugs and will for sure, improve the game like they did with the Hunter.Cons:- Still got some minor bug, but nothing that will prevent you from having fun- No quad, for long distance travel- Animal are easy to approach and if you scared them, they come back real fast with the good call- Windows 10 not recommended with this game... So many people got problem with it :D (Im glad, Im still with windows 7 :D)So, If you know what you are suposed to do in this kind of game, then you will have a great gaming experience.Recommended for people that know that its not a new Call of Duty :D "

												I've been playing theHunter classic for several years. I was looking forward to CotW. It looks and sounds as stunning as the game as potential. That's about it.-It crashes regularly, to a point where it locks up your whole computer and warrant a restart. I didn't experience that for a decade.-The game only supports a handfull of resolution, god forbids if you have an ultrawide screen.-Animal tracks completely disapears at some point, for no reason and with no way to bring it down, at all.-Animals are constantly calling and pin pointing their location to the player, it's a shooting range-Game has better support for controllers than kb&mouse (no way to move silently with a keyboard, no matter the stance)-The starting rifle is a toy and will hardly even pierce a small roe deer or coyotee's flesh even at a good angle. The solution is to aim for the head which is a nonsense in hunting.-The UI is clrearly your generic usual console UI,  plagued by bugs and inconcistencies.-There are no antler's variety-The grind is realAfter that rushed released It's up to the devs now to reach the amazing potential of Call of the Wild. Hoping most customer's first impressions won't be the last I still cannot recommand this game.			"

												The menus are garbage. Like, seriously.The menus are the worst thing about this game. I would honestly not care if they went the simplistic route like you would find in theHunter Classic. The gameplay isn't bad, unless you decide you want to look at your skills and press ESC. Except wait, that will just close your game because it thought you clicked ""Exit To Desktop."" Then there's the fact that there is no leave game option, just exit directly to desktop. Why? Navigating to another tab (i.e. Skills, Perks, Map) will act as if you're double-clicking or just glitch out in some other way.My experience in game hasn't been bad, at least until the menus decide to frustrate me.

												So I've decided ro review for this game as I see the previous hunter game didn't get much recommendations.Firstly, this has to be the most beautiful game I've ever seen, it smashes any other game in terms of realistic colours and lighting, the sun bouncing off foliage is exactly replicated in this game and looks photorealistic when seen.Secondly, the sounds are absolutely perfect, running through wetlands, rustling through bushes, all the sounds are perfectly recreated in this world, you can even hear the equipment your wearing rubbing against the objects around you.Now I get onto the hunting, which is in it's early days and constantly being improved, the devs are hot on problems, and I no longer get crashes. There are few bugs, when playing for an extended amount of time, tracks and scents seem to stop being generated, making it almost impossible to hunt anything.The actual hunting in itself is pretty decent, there's a nice flow to tracking to stalking to then finally killing the game, animals will nearly always hear you if you walk or run, so following a ""fresh"" track normally means crouching and taking it slow, running around everywhere wont get you any results, so if you're impatient, or don't like waiting 20-30 minutes + for a shot, then you obviously have never been hunting! It's not all about stalking though, there are open areas where there may be drinking, feeding or resting areas, and near there, is most likely a chance to build a lookout stand, this is great fun if you dont want to be stalking, but requires patience as the area around you may only be visited at certain times of the day, so time management is key with sitting and waiting.Once you actually find something to shoot, it's not a matter of shooting it ""wherever"" there is an art to knowing where and when to shoot, shoot them in the wrong place, and you're basically being cruel and irresponsible. shoot them through the heart, you'll most likely get a clean and instant death, and PETA goes home happy.When you DO kill an animal, you'll get a reward based on the following, the animal you killed, whether it has a trophy rating, how long it took to die, the integrity of the shot (the right weapon choice) and obviously where the animal was shot. Getting a gold rating is always a big thing in this game, the ability to track, stalk and shoot an animal properly and cleanly, and this game graces the player when they complete this correctly.Overall, some of the things I would like to see in the future include small game hunting, as an Englishman myself, I hunt rabbits with night vision, and do alot of pest control, night vision sights would be a great addition to the game, but also small game hunting. another great addition would be birds, pheasants for the english, ducks for the americans, would be incredibly entertaining and I look forward to what the game brings in the future.I would recommend this game if you hunt in real life, if you don't this might be abit dull if you don't understand why this game is so good, but if your looking to buy something straight out rather than pay a subscription, this game is for you.

												This game absolutely has the potential to be the best hunting sim one could ask for. However, it should never have been released in it's current state.Right now, it's just too buggy overall. Animals getting stuck on rocks, mission rewards not paying out correctly, nonresponsive and generally sluggish menu, etc.I'm sure all the above issues can be fixed with some time, but I can't bring myself to endorse Call of the Wild for now. If the situation changes and bugs are fixed, I will of course change my review.			"

												In short:While theHunter Classic could be called more of a hunting sim, Call of the Wild is an arcadey animal shooter, which was released utterly unfinished. Don't let the pretty landscapes and cheap(ish) price fool you; Avoid Call of the Wild like a plague until it's at least technically fixed and then hope they fire whoever whose idea this 'new direction' for the game was.Pros:+ Super pretty graphics+ No microtransactionsCons:- Unrealistic: Too many animals, which are near impossible to spook- Buggy: Encountered tons of glitches during 30min of gameplay- UnoptimizedMy experience:I loaded up the game and - after fiddling with the settings to make it run even semi-playably - decided to head out and find some game. Literally one minute after leaving the cottage I heard the warning call of a bear. I looked at the handy audio direction indicator and there the bear was, casually strolling at me. WTF?? I decided to take a shot at it. The bear reacted by taking a few running steps and then getting stuck on an invisible wall. I shot at it again, and again it took a few steps and stopped. This time it turned to face me head on and stare me with its big, quizzical eyes, as if it was hoping me to end its buggy virtual existence. I did.Now, in the original theHunter, running around and shooting your gun tended to have the side effect of making you unable to see a single hair of an animal for the next ~30 minutes. Not the case with this game, it seems! Just as I had finished slaughtering the poor Pooh, I SAW A BLACKTAIL DEER LOOKING AT ME, COMPLETELY PLACID. AND HEARD ANOTHER BEAR. What is this? Russian oligarch hunting simulator with tame animals tied down for you to shoot at on your private ranch?Thanks for turning the only somewhat respectable hunting simulator in the world into a dumbed-down shooting gallery for the Adderall generation. A bold move, I would say, as the niche appeal of the original game was the only thing keeping it afloat. Let's see how it pays off.EDIT: It is entirely possible the game was bugged and/or the game makes sure you see an animal the first time you play the missions. Or I just got extremely lucky. However, I wanted to keep my playtime short to keep my eligibility for the refund program, after seeing the glitches and framerate issues. I'm open to trying this game again at a later date - but at this time I cannot recommend it.			"

												This is a joke, not a game. I paid 30 euros to discover it has just two maps...wtf ? It's full of bugs from day one. This one of them which comes first into my mind:I went to system when I was in the game to make some changes. Guess what, you can't change brightness, there is no button for such setting and because of that screen colors seem washed up, it looks terrible. When I wanted to resume game the escape key didn't work, even if it says press escape to go back. This is, as almost all the launches of EW a  ♥♥♥♥ed-up job, like Whiterime ridge map in Hunter Classic. Don't buy this game, it's a waste of money. And that is not all. The so called bonuses won't work, they are ♥♥♥♥ed up even if on The Hunter forum a it's silence, no one from EW, despite the problmes raised, is there to give us an explanation for this new screw-up .  At the hour I write this review I still can't have the three bonuses promised. (A rifle for the classic and two items for this game I review in this very moment)PS - And guess what, in its first day the game was cracked , it's for free for whoever wanted on the web. If I knew it was so bad, I would have waited this moment instead of wasting my money on a crap game. "

												The open world and scenery is simply amazing. While you maye need a moderately powerful computer to play this game to get the ""full beauty"", you  can still be left awed by the many sights. Are there bugs? Well yes, all new games have bug's. If you have ever let that be the reason you got fed up with a game and give it a poor review, thats not a good reason in my opinion.  Pros; open world, relatively cheap, no licenses for animals, infinite starter ammo, hud is easy to follow, and more.Cons; tracking at first is confusing, menus seem chunky and slow/freeze, small graphic errors/lag.With more time things will get ironed out and improved upon, making the game smoother and even more enjoyabe.  Just remember this isn't thehunter classic and plays differently but shares some simular key features. Most importantly be patient and have fun!			"

												Its a really awesome game ive been looking forwarth to a long time, but the bugs and glitches really show that its just released. I hope they fix the folowing things in the upcoming update:- Able to switch between single and multiplayer without restarting the game- Able to minimilize the game and open it again without crashing- Unlock outposts in multiplayer, cause a friend of mine unlocked a outpost which i cannot unlock, cause he did it before i       could in single player and now im not able to use it- Sometimes the tracks become invisable and u cannot track anymore untill u restart the game- The mechanics and accuracy for the bow and arrow- Animals being stuck and cannot move, which are easy money and exp right now :J- Some structure like lookout towers are glitched and cannot be buildBut like i said its just got released, but if they can fix the stuff above the game is absolutely great ^-^			"

												Many negative reviews.  I see one person review that is negative and the guy has over 600 followers.  He has given every game a negative review except one game...out of the 50 + reviews He has given all have been neg.The game has nice graphics, and is easy to learn and for the price..I am having fun.  If you looking for something to enjoy..Buy this game.  Its not super easy..but is quick to learn.  I am sure they will be adding more content.  I have not crashed one time.    Would be fun to try with multiple people in the game.If you like to Hunt and enjoy long walks in the woods...go for it...Adding to this review:Been Playing for a few days now..Still enjoy the game.  They just did a patch and I think it has even added to the experience.  I do wish they would put an ingame clock someplace so you could tell what time it is in game...some missions have time elements and that would help.			"

												March 6th 105 hours in...I have to say STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAMETHE BUGS ARE WORSE THAN EVER AFTER PATCHES.SO FRUSTRATING YOU WILL WISH YOU COULD SHOOT YOURSELF IN THE FACE. But you can't because one of the bugs is you lose your weapons. You cannot unlock blinds and towers. I wasted 5 hours doing that only to log back on and have all green question marks on the map again. Tracks, blood trails and animals keep dissapearing even after a fresh start. Low fps,Glitchy inventory which you can access once in awhile. It will move your quick access items. Have had crashes, Sound looping, and multiplayer games where some people can't see animals. The devs are busy changing prices on items making them 3x original prices, cause I guess its important to tweak game play instead of fix broken game problems. There is no quit to menu button, Animal Ai is horrible. We play in multiplayer just hoping to find a herd of buffalo stuck in the rocks so we can waste them as the bury their heads in the dirt with their hind legs kicking in the air futely running to nowhere. ITS A FKN HUNTING SIM. You think that animal AI might be on the top of your priority list. Also you cannot get some animal callers even 105 hours into game. That's great. Lets have prey running around you cannot call in. You can just randomly hope to run into one and kill it. RIGHT because most of the people buying this are going to play 100 + hours to try and unlock everything. Hence them changing prices and level caps etc. THEY HAVE NO CLUE WHAT THIS GAME IS. They boast about making it more arcade style so they can still support hunter classic. 100 hours into a game and still having stuff locked is not arcade stlye. You have no concept of what your own game is. The maps are so big and you have to run everywhere. No vehicles. You have to find the outposts before you can even jump to them. That would be fine if AUTO RUN didn't kill you half the time on your way there. I have tried to be patient with this game. BUT AS OF TODAY MY PATIENCE RAN OUT. There are MANY MORE problems with this game. Many of which existed from beta testing right through release. STAY AWAY FROM THIS UNFINISHED TURD!!!!10 hours in or so...updateOK This game just won me over!! Here's why I just had a great moose hunt. Learning only shoot one animal. you can track a vital hit animal for 15 minutes or more this game is not easy.  Then I had the best hunt ever. A black bear 100 yards out I shoot him. He's running I shoot him again at 200 yards he's still running I shoot him a 3rd time...all of this within 10 seconds. I go in to find the track. (oh don't forget to reload) I come in 300 yards I just get to where I last saw him...and out of the bush he charges BANG I shoot him again at 10 yards, gun recoils I'm shaking I cant see, he's still charging. I get my trusty ranger under control and down just in time to drop him with a 5th shot at 4.44 yards...I LOVE THIS GAMEI am now changing my review to recommend. If you love hunting this is a great adventure game.lets keep those updates and patches coming though ;)Editing as time goes on:After 6 hours or so I would like to update and add the following. I am a die hard hunting game follower having played every deer hunter back in the day, trophy hunts, cabela's and a host of others. In real life I am a hunter. (Harvested 3 whitetail this last fall).  This game is the best looking I have ever played. I have seen some cool things in this game. My first kill was a fox. I shot the fox he ran off. Narrator says he's not going far. And boy was he right. Out of the bush 2 black bears burst and grabbed my fox. I never saw it again...LOLThis is a good game. It has not crashed on me once in my 6 hours. The little bugs are just soooo annoying. I will change this review to positive when the bugs are ironed out.This game has POTENTIAL. As long as the dev is fixing and adding this will be a great game!Original reviewWell I have to agree with the negatives on this board. Too many bugs to play right now. We pay full price for this and its unplayable. Very annoying. Yes I see there are patches coming out and they are working on it. Why would you release this game with all of the same problems listed by beta testers. That's bad mojo on your part. I knew that coming into this and was so stoked to play the game I bought it anyway. Now I have faith that it will be fixed and sooner rather than later.bugs I found in my first couple of hours:Bought bow bought ammo. (3x) no ammo in inventory cannot use bow. FRUSTRATINGcannot zoom with controller setupcannot select menus with controller setupjoining multiplayer game issuesGame does not save sound menu changesInventory menu does not workHeadlamp will not turn offDeer caught on structuresdeer shot 4 times at close range would not die....just ran in circlesHunter stats are not correct. shows wrong number of shots and accuracy numbersLow FPS on high end machineOn the bright side:game looks and sounds greatlarge mapsdecent price for full gamesupport is coming (2 patches already)in conclusion you get points for support...but then I have to ask why did you release this game in such a poor state?

												Brilliant effort by the dev. Waited all my life for a really good hunting sim. Its been awesome to play a really rewarding especially those dam coyotes. Almost zero bugs now with single player, few minor UX issues with the interface, buying ammo and more visual inticators on what you just bought. Mulitplayer is great but it does crash at least twice in a few hours everytime still after latest patch. 2 people cant go in the same deer stand either or one of you die from injuries. I dont ever remember killing my friends in real life when we are both up in a stand lol.			"

												in a word, this game has a great idea--hunting in wild areas. But at the beginning, there were so many bugs:i had killed one prey, there were some still hanging around like nothing had happened;maybe because of the model of the map, more often than sometimes, a prey could been stucked among stones or sth, you could do it with a knife if you had;i had killed one, other preys have been scared, then they just runned around not away.the 3 bugs mentioned above appeared in the lake reserve(the 2nd) on my laptop.after installing patch 1.1, the frame number becomes higher, and i haven't found any one of the bugs appeared yet. so the experience is more comfortable. but harder to get to harvest...

												So, comming from the orginal theHunter, I can say, that this verison is a HUGE improvement.  One of the best things this verison did was remove all those damned ""Micro-Transactions.""  I greatly enjoy that I can take the weapon I start with and shoot at Whitetail, Blacktail, Moose, Elk, Black Bear, etc and not need ""a lience"" to do so.  Another thing I can say, the upgraded graphics is in a word, BEAUTIFUL!  It also is not heavy on the GPU or CPU.  Having a Octacore FX8350 3.5Mhz CPU and a nVidia FXF 960 4GB SSC GPU, it runs smoothly.  There, is of corse the bugs, however dont let this detract from the overall Experience.  I would recommend anyone into Hunting to purchase this games, as they have improved the engine, and removed some of the things orignal theHunter players have complained.			"

												Ok, devs released a 1.3GB patch today as promised. They seem to be willing to fix all those stupid little bugs. Because of that, thumbs up!Here is my old negative review. Note that not everything was fixed yet but as long as they keep working on it I am recommending the game:*********WARNING***********************WARNING****************Even when this game is supposedly to be considered fully released it has actually still more in common with an easy access title! The game menu, for once, is extremely amateurish and borderline infuriating! It is not possible, for example, to assume that the game would save changes you made to it like turning toggle scope on. It will work for 5 mintues but then for whatever reason will suddenly go back to default toggle scope off !!?? I think it resets options whenever you score a kill and open the trophy screen. Another example for the ridiculous game menu is the apply button of the graphics options tab which is not even 'clickable'! To top things off the game won't even save your graphics options which is really inconvenient when u restart, cause optimization isn't exactly CotW's strong suit.. But zealots will probably find an excuse here as well, huh?Once you reach the startup screen you'll be welcomed with the game character's hand, holding a mobile in first person only to see that vanish in a matter of seconds so that the camera can fly up into the air in order to show you the awesome landscape which happens all in the background of your startup screen where you can select options, start game etc.. Another easily visible sign that this game was rushed out of the door or for an early access title.. Once you fought your way through the pain-inducing game menu you will reappear in either the american or european hunting reserve only to get immeditely jumped by hordes of apparently sedated animals which barely care at all about your presence! My first experience was literally spawning in, seeing a deer, killing it, turning around, seeing another one, walking, tracking, harvesting, seeing another one and so on.. You barely get a chance NOT to immedaitely see another animal which is just ludicrous considering that you're blasting through the forest with firearms! That was my experience in the US reserve the european, however, has way less animals in it. Sadly, such animals there are just as stupid as the American ones.. Like me shooting at one and only a few seconds later some jerk of a deer thinks it's a good idea to pop out of the woodwork right next to me in order to get shot, too instead of being frightened by the shot and running away.. Animals sink halfway through the floor. Sounds animals make sound like they're right next to you even when they are actually way farther away than the sound suggests which is an issue in the hunter one and primal, too, by the way. There are no actual wounds animated on killed animals! According to other reports is there also no animal variety of the same type or in other words, all deer apparently look alike! Antlers apparently do not vary as well, only size but not the looks of it.. Some calls animals make are apparently incorrect, too.There's a ton more I could list here if I really wanted to but I think at this point you should have a good idea of what you're getting into!I will change my review to positive IF devs ever bother to actually fix all those issues! I currently like the game enough to go on a walk before I go to sleep in real life. The environment is rly quite nice and relaxing if there only weren't all those pathetic issues which basically scream RUSHED OUT OF THE DOOR!!!Here a graphics bug where only the frame of the mobile is visible:http://i.imgur.com/rPVtrTh.jpg "

												I have 380+ hours of theHunter: Classic under my belt so I think I've come to some conclusions after a dozen hours or so.I have had zero performance issues, crashes or the like to date and it runs slicker than dog poop on linoleum on my i5 and GTX 1060 6Gb. I don't find all of the claims of clipping and geometry issues to be any greater in extent than what I experienced in tH:C (theHunter: Classic, not THC). Is this a better game? Graphically yes and the gameplay is not far off of par in my opinion. They ruined the huntermate by changing a few things so that takes some getting used to. I enjoy the missions and perk points as a bit of a motivator to play and don't find the menu system to be all that difficult. Seriously so much salt over small potatoes.Yes, some of the animal behaviour is screwy and some of the calls seems a bit over the top but I would expect that with continual patching as seen to this point, some of this stuff can be tweaked.There are no micro-transactions or the idiotic 3 month license that tH:C forced you to repeatedly buy so this is a thumbs up for me.

												used to play this alot and when i did played the game find it little boring still do now, But i will say the graphic are simply great and better then when i 1st played the game on demo. So i know the graphic have change in game big time. and the feeling of finnly finding and shoting the animal that youve been stalking for the last 10 hours is just simply   boring thats prob why find the game boring. everytime kill  a animale from long distanes it disapers time you get there. STUPID !! But i will say i do keep playing trying change my mind on game. Also it is ashame that your limited in map and to go out in water and outside of map. But end of the day apart from the boring limited side and some times the things you kill disapers it the grathic i like think it has done well in that side of things. Has for the game it self yeah its ok but not worth 29.99 or more. The price need to be dropped BIGTIME.			"

												I've been a regular player of TheHunter (original) for about two years and absolutely loved it.  TheHunter:COW is now my new hunting addiction.  The main difference is that the microtransactions are gone, for better or worse.  You want to upgrade your rifle?  Better go out and bring home some bacon (literally) and earn that in-game currency for the gun.  I'm fine with this.I won't even mention the graphics; it's gorgeous.  Runs smoothly on my PC (< 1 year old) with no problems.The one area this game falls down on is missions.  I enjoy going into the woods to hunt, but I would like more purpose behind it.  The missions in the game currently are linear; so if you get a mission you don't want to do (i.e., bow missions), your quest line has come to an end!  I wish there was a random component here... ""Go harvest 5 wild boar for blah blah blah..."" -- this would just give the game a little more purpose.But overall, it's a great game.  I'm glad I bought it.  I will be spending many hours with it in coming years, I'm sure.			"

												I had previously made a big long review about how I wanted to love the game, but it was so unplayable that I just couldnt... Well, there have been several major updates since that review and I felt inclined to re-review, because I really do like the game.  Lets start there.. I really like the game. Its absolutely gorgeous, to start witt. The lighting and atmospheric effects are on point. The graphics on the tree does leave something to be desired   As far as a hunting game goes, its top notch. If you are looking for an Arcade Style hunting game where you just load up and there is stuff in front of you to kill, this is not that game. If you are looking for a game where you wander endlessly, sometimes with purpose, sometimes without and have to opportunity to stalk and murder a variety of animals while you do, then this is your game!!Best Walking Simulator of 2017.10/10 Will walk again.

												Let me get one thing clear straight away, I love this game! It hits all the right notes and I just hope so bad that the devs keep updating the game and adding new content. I played Classic but really didnt like how expensive everything was; as soon as I saw they were creating a one time payment game I couldnt wait.The graphics and the audio for the most part are fantastic, while I would like to increase the draw distance its not as bad as the TheHunter Classic. There are a few sound bugs every now and then, epecially when you are close to water and its raining, the audio starts clipping and looping. Also I dont know how AA works in the game but I would like to be able to change it as I can still see jagged edges everywhere when in 1080.Multiplayer is a lot of fun but this is where most of the work is needed; I have only played multiplayer for a few hours and there has been quite a few bugs. I have had a game where the other person couldnt hear or even see any of the animals that I could, another game where the other person couldnt get any of his items out even though they were in his inventory, and perhaps the worst thing for me with multiplayer is that only the host can unlock new camps, lookouts and anything else you can click on. Also we have to take it in turns to claim downed animals because only the person that harvests the animal gets a reward and there is no way to tell who hit it without clicking to harvest it. Apart from the above problems I really have had a great time playing this game, I love the feeling of tracking an animal through forests and fields only to finally get that shot you wanted and hope that the animal doesnt run off for miles while spilling blood everywhere. You get a great feel of acomplishment with this game and it can be very rewarding. The items are quite expensive and take a long time to get and levelling is very very slow which is a pain when your waiting for those new skills and perks you so desperately need.Things I would like to see added:1. More animals - a lot more, especially birds as currently you cant harvest any flying animals.2. More guns, scopes and other items like tents, portable hunting encloures, etc.3. Missions for multiplayer, not everyone wants to go against each other, coop missions would be nice.To me the game is still in early access but after some updates and new content I think this could be an amazing game. I know some of the new content will be DLC but I hope a good portion of it is free as the game does lack a bit of content at the moment especially in the flying department.If and when things change I will update my review as necessary.

I believe the game could have some kinda food system to add to the reason your hunting, you head back to camp to stock up and cook some food on the fire thats at the cabin to refresh your self then head back out for a good amount of time and repeat. would be nice.

												My TheHunter: COTW Review. Graphics: The graphics are very pretty and really well done but it is sorta a wool cover over our eyes on whats hiddenly broken about this game. Hunting: You have to either get a rare one hit shot on the game your hunting and take it down in that one shot but most of the time you will find yourself shooting an elk or bear or boar more than enough to take it down doesn't matter if you shot it in the spine or leg it well still be able to run. Also you can't hunt small game such as rabbits or other small critters same goes for birds you can't hunt those either. Also it would be interesting if they add fishing that is a form of hunting.Shop-Locker: You spend hours gathering enough money for that one rifle you wanted for some reason it's more than 1k but you buy it anyways just to realise that you just spent $42,000 on a basic looking rifle no carved animals on it's stock no gold or silver enlays nothing just wood maybe some cheap camo bullet holder on the side nothing fancy isn't like you just spent aton of money. Then you notice for $680 you can get a signle pack of 10 rounds for your said rifle. ""Side Note"" irl you can get a deer hunting rifle as cheap as $350 and for $20 you can get some hunting rounds for a scope it can be very cheap like the rifle or less or it can rack your price up to 6 times the price of the rifle. Menu: Just a basic menu nothing fancy and once in the game there isn't a exit to the menu only to desktop. Now this well probably be fixed soon but doesn't change that they placed a game for $30 on the market without adding a main feature into the game it's self. So ill keep this in the review. UI: Nothing fancy just a somewhat see through tiny box that tell you your ammo count heart rate a basic campos that's about it even your smartphone gps looks basic the one from TheHunter looks more well done and better. Now of course in time there might be an update where they make the ui look way better but as of now it makes me think our hunters we are playing have a pair of google glasses on that's how bad it looks maybe have a more realistic looking map or have a campos that looks like something a hunter or hiking has. Maybe the ammo count is a pouch or something so it's more realistic looking either way it doesn't look that great. Realisim: Now i know it's a video game but it's trying to be like a realistic hunting sim. I feel like just playing it these devs didn't do any research they were doing far more research in making the 2 maps look as realistic as they could or pretty as they could. Instead of going on irl hunting trips or just watching videos on it. Something that can give them a taste on what it is like. Also there's something called google all they had to do was look up hunting sites on how much hunting clothing cost same goes for all these weapons and ammo. Then how it is now in the game where it almost feels like a pay to win but you can't pay with real money only in game. Weapons: Where is all the 22's and air rifles. That's what id want to see people hunt with those type of weapons in Euro and Germany same with the west. Gameplay: You well be able to spend lots of hours hunting unlocking new weapons exploring messing around in multiplayer. Finding all the relics or easter eggs. Climbing up high places taking pics of animals. Just enjoying the view it's a very nice game if you always wanted to hunt or you just like the outdoors but you are mostly in doors. Updates: There well be updates soon or later that well fix these issues just wait and in time everything well be fixed also there well probably DLC's.			"

												March 6th 105 hours in...I have to say STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAMETHE BUGS ARE WORSE THAN EVER AFTER PATCHES.SO FRUSTRATING YOU WILL WISH YOU COULD SHOOT YOURSELF IN THE FACE. But you can't because one of the bugs is you lose your weapons. You cannot unlock blinds and towers. I wasted 5 hours doing that only to log back on and have all green question marks on the map again. Tracks, blood trails and animals keep dissapearing even after a fresh start. Low fps,Glitchy inventory which you can access once in awhile. It will move your quick access items. Have had crashes, Sound looping, and multiplayer games where some people can't see animals. The devs are busy changing prices on items making them 3x original prices, cause I guess its important to tweak game play instead of fix broken game problems. There is no quit to menu button, Animal Ai is horrible. We play in multiplayer just hoping to find a herd of buffalo stuck in the rocks so we can waste them as the bury their heads in the dirt with their hind legs kicking in the air futely running to nowhere. ITS A FKN HUNTING SIM. You think that animal AI might be on the top of your priority list. Also you cannot get some animal callers even 105 hours into game. That's great. Lets have prey running around you cannot call in. You can just randomly hope to run into one and kill it. RIGHT because most of the people buying this are going to play 100 + hours to try and unlock everything. Hence them changing prices and level caps etc. THEY HAVE NO CLUE WHAT THIS GAME IS. They boast about making it more arcade style so they can still support hunter classic. 100 hours into a game and still having stuff locked is not arcade stlye. You have no concept of what your own game is. The maps are so big and you have to run everywhere. No vehicles. You have to find the outposts before you can even jump to them. That would be fine if AUTO RUN didn't kill you half the time on your way there. I have tried to be patient with this game. BUT AS OF TODAY MY PATIENCE RAN OUT. There are MANY MORE problems with this game. Many of which existed from beta testing right through release. STAY AWAY FROM THIS UNFINISHED TURD!!!!10 hours in or so...updateOK This game just won me over!! Here's why I just had a great moose hunt. Learning only shoot one animal. you can track a vital hit animal for 15 minutes or more this game is not easy.  Then I had the best hunt ever. A black bear 100 yards out I shoot him. He's running I shoot him again at 200 yards he's still running I shoot him a 3rd time...all of this within 10 seconds. I go in to find the track. (oh don't forget to reload) I come in 300 yards I just get to where I last saw him...and out of the bush he charges BANG I shoot him again at 10 yards, gun recoils I'm shaking I cant see, he's still charging. I get my trusty ranger under control and down just in time to drop him with a 5th shot at 4.44 yards...I LOVE THIS GAMEI am now changing my review to recommend. If you love hunting this is a great adventure game.lets keep those updates and patches coming though ;)Editing as time goes on:After 6 hours or so I would like to update and add the following. I am a die hard hunting game follower having played every deer hunter back in the day, trophy hunts, cabela's and a host of others. In real life I am a hunter. (Harvested 3 whitetail this last fall).  This game is the best looking I have ever played. I have seen some cool things in this game. My first kill was a fox. I shot the fox he ran off. Narrator says he's not going far. And boy was he right. Out of the bush 2 black bears burst and grabbed my fox. I never saw it again...LOLThis is a good game. It has not crashed on me once in my 6 hours. The little bugs are just soooo annoying. I will change this review to positive when the bugs are ironed out.This game has POTENTIAL. As long as the dev is fixing and adding this will be a great game!Original reviewWell I have to agree with the negatives on this board. Too many bugs to play right now. We pay full price for this and its unplayable. Very annoying. Yes I see there are patches coming out and they are working on it. Why would you release this game with all of the same problems listed by beta testers. That's bad mojo on your part. I knew that coming into this and was so stoked to play the game I bought it anyway. Now I have faith that it will be fixed and sooner rather than later.bugs I found in my first couple of hours:Bought bow bought ammo. (3x) no ammo in inventory cannot use bow. FRUSTRATINGcannot zoom with controller setupcannot select menus with controller setupjoining multiplayer game issuesGame does not save sound menu changesInventory menu does not workHeadlamp will not turn offDeer caught on structuresdeer shot 4 times at close range would not die....just ran in circlesHunter stats are not correct. shows wrong number of shots and accuracy numbersLow FPS on high end machineOn the bright side:game looks and sounds greatlarge mapsdecent price for full gamesupport is coming (2 patches already)in conclusion you get points for support...but then I have to ask why did you release this game in such a poor state?

												I have 380+ hours of theHunter: Classic under my belt so I think I've come to some conclusions after a dozen hours or so.I have had zero performance issues, crashes or the like to date and it runs slicker than dog poop on linoleum on my i5 and GTX 1060 6Gb. I don't find all of the claims of clipping and geometry issues to be any greater in extent than what I experienced in tH:C (theHunter: Classic, not THC). Is this a better game? Graphically yes and the gameplay is not far off of par in my opinion. They ruined the huntermate by changing a few things so that takes some getting used to. I enjoy the missions and perk points as a bit of a motivator to play and don't find the menu system to be all that difficult. Seriously so much salt over small potatoes.Yes, some of the animal behaviour is screwy and some of the calls seems a bit over the top but I would expect that with continual patching as seen to this point, some of this stuff can be tweaked.There are no micro-transactions or the idiotic 3 month license that tH:C forced you to repeatedly buy so this is a thumbs up for me. Haven't tried MP yet. May update if I do			"

												To anybody that likes hunting games i would recommend this game to you, it was huge maps, a variety skills and perks, multiple ways to hunt, and the developers are working hard to fix any/all problems that people are having with the game. There are a couple of problems i have with the game so far.1. In multiplayer the only the host can inteact with everything your friends or other players cant interact with lookouts, outposts, and undiscovered points on the map.2. Its some times feels like you go really slow out of no where kind of like if you were in slow-mo but only you this includes reloading, running, using lures etc.			"

												Outstanding looking game with a lot of potential, but the game is basically an Early Access title. Lots of bugs that needs fixing and there are some problems within the game such as the currency system (takes like 4 hours of hunting to get 1 rifle that is barely better than the first one you start with), and the travelling in this game - oh man.. There are 2 maps in the game that are both vast and beautiful, but you have to walk/run EVERYWHERE. There is a fast travel option but you need to travel to the hunting lodge in order to unlock it. Basically everything in this game needs a slight tweak of some sort. The devs have been communicative and I trust that they will straighten things out to make this game what it needs to be.For now, I can't recommend this game until they fix some of the major problems and add much-needed content.

												An entertaining game, but more often than not, it freezes every 10 minutes or so.  Frustrating when you try to reach a destination or see a nice animal, and then it freezes, forcing you to start over from the outpost.  If they fix this game, it would be worth getting and playing.  Also, the game is missing a exit to menu button, which is like building a house without a bathroom.  Your only option is to exit to desktop, or let the game crash on its own.			"

												Buggy but brilliant. There are numerous UI glitches, an interface that is half missing when playing on 21:9 resolutions being the most noticeable for me, goven that the critical display of ammo, visibility and noise are off the screen. The map is very clunky as are all the menus.However, I have never felt so immersed in an environment. They are huge, gorgeous and full of wonderful ambient sounds and changing weather and lighting. I really hope the devs can bring the rest of the game up to the same standard but in the meantime I am simply enjoying the escapism of wondering through these worlds.			"

												This game is as enjoyable as it is good looking; exploring dense forest, wavey plains and steep rock faces all in search of that perfect deer. You've got a decent selection of gear to choose from, such as bows and shotguns, bolt action rifles and lever action repeaters, scents and callers and ammuntion focusing on either penetrating thicker hides or causing more damage to the vitals. You'll be using these against several breeds of deer, fox, bears, herds of bison, moose and wild boar, all of which spread over two large open maps. One map takes place in Northern America and the other in rural Germany.This game still has a few flaws, however. The animal AI can sometimes get caught on the terrian or get stuck in pathing loop. Whenever you go prone, the camera can clip through the ground, revealing the vast nothingness below. The sound glitches and crackles when there is a lot going on.It you can look passed a few rough edges, you'll have a great hunting game on your hands. I've paid full price and I do not regret waiting for a sale. It you enjoy hunting games or exploring vast open worlds, then I highly recommend this game.			"

												Visuals and sounds is theHunter: Call of the Wilds strongest sides, which contribute to the fact that the game actually feels like a proper hunting simulator. If your looking for that, before you continue reading, buy it. The minor bugs which remain in the game will not ruin the experience.But as a game it lacks in several aspects. When they released the game they had high requirements on weapon scores to be able to unlock the next (usually a more powerful) weapon, which gave you something to work towards. The weapon score demanded the player to carefully consider the shots you take in order to be able to score the highest possible. Unfortunately, two weeks in the requirements were removed as the community demanded it which essentially ruined the experience as a game for me, as I enjoy working towards a goal in the game.			"

												As everyone already said, the grafic is really really beutiful, and the shooting part is just lovely.. one bad thing, and yes I have tried to google an answer; will there be more content? if you compare Call of the Wild with the Classic game, there is only 2% as much content in THCW than THC... Of course there will be DLC and it will cost, but comon, why release a game that goes back this far in content then the first?5/10 toasters, the grafic and the flow in the game got a solid 10, but you know why I had to lower the score.

												Gameplay:Its not Call Of Duty in the Forest, where bears on steroids, 50 feet tall attacking innocent topless girls in mini skirts, and u save them - (btw I would love this kind of game) - this is slow paced, hunting simulator. My last hunt was tracking black bear for like 20 minutes, and then hit it from 250 meters in the head. It really was like real life hunting - you have shot statistics after hit, where did u hit animal and the score. Its really interesting. I can suspect there will be more DLCs like Alaska with Grizzly bears and stuff like this - which will make this game only better.Graphics are great, and you really have feeling being in the forest, moving slowly tracking your prey - if you like, slow paced games, where you have to think a lot, a truly hunting simulation - it is game for You.

												First i just want to say Its not my intension to bash or ""♥♥♥♥ talk"" this game!   I have a love/hate relationship to this game atm.  I had a good few hours in the online game before this came out and loved it.  This game on the other hand I'm still not to sure about.   I have played this game for 20 + hours the last few days and have made a little list of pros and cons.  There will be more cons then pros atm but that does not mean i dont like the game, i just feel like its not at its full potential.   CONS!  1: In the settings u can choose between toggle aim or to hold the aim with right mouse and this works for a few ""aims"" and its just reset to default again.  2: The waypoint system is either bugged or its the weirdest waypoint system i have ever seen in a game! When you place a waypoint on the map it shows how long it is to the place you want to go , but it also shows up in the opposite direction of where you want to go and its just confusing.  3: Animals get stuck in trees and bushes.  4: Animal trails disappear  5: When you og prone you can see under the map at some locations and that can make you shoot the map instead of the animal you are hunting.  6: Missions with taking pictures of the animals is so bugged and it took me 1-2 hours to  finish the mission! And i took more then 50 pictures of the deer! The mission where u have to take pictures of the 2 or more bears is impossible ""At least for me"" honestly i dont think the picture missions should be in the game... 7:  And then the most annoying bug for me at the moment is a shotgun bug! I used the shotgun to takedown a deer at close range and now when i shoot at any animal with any gun it says i used the shotgun, and that means i cant do some missions since the game thinks i used the shotgun at a mission where I'm only allowed to shoot with a rifle! 8: The maps is large! Very large! And that means a lot of walking around... It takes forever to get to the destination you need to be! This can be fixed with cars,atv,bikes, horses or any vehicle. It would help a lot!  9:Places to rest/sleep/fast travel to is just to far apart if u could buy a tent to take with u so u can sleep outside without having to fast travel to a camp it would make it way better.  PROS!  1: The game graphics is beautiful and feels well done! 2: The way you track animals is brilliant! The fact that u have to turn on your light at night to see the tracks just makes it even better. 3: Leveling system feels good and its interesting. U can choose from a large amount of skills and perks 4: Never had a crash or big fps drop "" You do need a ok pc to run at ultra "" 5: Missions is fun and a good way to make some cash to buy new guns and tools. 6: There is a good choice in weapons and tools to buy in the game. It can feel like a grind to get the cash to buy them at times but that just mean that you have to hunt more 7: This can be an awesome hunting game or u can just go on a killing spree if u want it up to you.  If u play the way i think its meant to be played it feels like a brilliant hunting game!  This game does not feel like its finished, not even close! BUT it is still an amazing game if u give it a chance. Its buggy at times, and i have to be honest i hate this game at times... But i know it has a lot of potential if the devs can fix some of the worst bugs and maybe add a few things to it. I'm gonna continue to play it and hope the game gets better.			"

												SooooooPositive :-Awesome graphics, really beautiful game.-UI is intuitive, and easy to use.-Finally getting the hit you want is highly satisfying.Negative-Half of my kills were deers stuck in rocks or trees, basically free kill. (I almost felt bad for the poor things)-Had 4 game crashes in 2 hours. (Most likely it will crash when you're about to get the shot you waited for so long)-On 3 occasions, I headshot a deer from a 50ft distance. The deer runs (it was probably frightened by the bullet going through its head).Refunded, too many crashes and bugs. Great potential though.			"

This game will rank higher than the previous game for me personally once all the kinks are ironed out and we start to see a steady flow of new content but it feels like that is a bit far away from now. Until that happens I can happily roam the gorgeous landscapes and relax for a while.			"

												I had just spotted my first decent buck in Layton Lake and observed, attempting to get closer for a better shot. However, he quickly spooked and bolted off into the underbrush. I tracked him, but eventually gave up and decided to head for a nearby observation point and take in the scenery.I'd like to say, this game has perfectly captured how it feels to be in the woods. I hike occasionally during the summer and this is the first game I've ever seen that had me convinced my character was actually in a forest instead of just a clump of trees. The underbrush is great and the topogrophy is excellent. The way the lighting interacts with the trees and brush is absolutely perfect. Back to ingame, I continued along a path leading to the lookout tower. Then my attention was brought straight forward by the warning grunt of a black bear. I quickly dropped into a crouch and raised my rifle. Though some brush, I could see a bear with a cinnamon coat quartering towards me, coming along the path maybe 45 yards away. I lined up the reticle with the front of his shoulder, held my breath, pulled the trigger. He took a few more steps along the path, so I fired again, dropping him in his tracks.This is what you get when you purchase this product. A convincing virtual world and a rewarding experience. At times it's a painfully slow burner, but when you finally get that perfect shot you know that the game didn't give it to you. You earned it. P.S. to fans of turkey hunting, waterfowling and upland birds: They aren't currently included in the game but I have a strong suspicion they'll make their way in at some point.EDIT: I should mention there did seem to be a large infestation of bugs when the game was first released but it has been patched multiple times since release and I have yet to experience any game breaking bugs, just a few very minor graphical glitches.

												TL:DR: Great game with loads of bugs, however not any gamebreaking ones I have found yet. However, before you buy try out the origiinal TheHunter for free, since the gameplay and concept are pretty much identical themselves,Pros:- Alot better graphics than the last thehunter. It makes the world feel much more immersive and gives sort of an ambient feeling when hunting. (which in my opinion makes it less boring)- NO MICROTRANSACTIONS! The previous hunter was a P2W game. If you are thinking of playing the previous thehunter because ""oh oh oh, i dont want to buy this game but I still want to hunt for free bah baah blah"" then you\re on the wrong track. You can unlock all species immideatly and can get better weapons by grinding them.- Night hunting. Nuff said.- This is by far the best (and one of the only) hunting game out there. Hunting simulation is a genre where currently, you do not have much choice.Cons:- Absolute garbage UI.- Multiplayer cons:   - Can't claim lookout points or outposts in multiplayer unless you are the owner of the server   - Server browser is absolute trash with very few filtering options   - Zones that appear that animals avoid when an animal is shot in the area do not match up with guests and the host   - Sometimes guests and owners see different animals (happens very rarely!)   - and loads of other small bugs- ALL OF THE BUGS! Seriously this and the UI is by far the biggest issue I have with this game. There are SO many of them and you will encounter them EVERYWHERE! They are not gamebreaking and do not exactly do that much, but this just feels like that the developers have not tested this game AT ALL or it's just a beta version (however, the game has already had a closed beta)- No trophy shots- No baiting barrelsSo, conclusion:If you want a hunting game, play the original TheHunter for a few hours and see if you like the waiting, the having to endlessly be careful not to sppok an animal and so on. If you do, buy this game! It's better than the original in almost every way (of course, except the bugs). It's a great game. There are none that compare to this. It's quite fun to play by yourself and even better if you play with your friends.			"

												This game is actually really good, the gameplay is nice, there is a lot of things to consider be aware of like wind, bushes, noise you make and i like the fact that you have experience and gain levels and have to place perk and ksills points.BUT this game is also full of bugs, full of unlogic stats.for exemple the starting bullets will have a penetration of 40 while the ""designed to penetrate"" bullets will have 20.When you unlock a active perk, you cannot use it because you cannot equip it.When you purchase bullets you cannot know how many you have unless you equip them into your gun.The bullets weight 0.02 but will still weight 0.02 if you carry a milion of them.And even more and more...That game should have the ""alpha"" tag actually.Still I really enjoy playing it.

												Been playing for a minute now and have noticed a couple things that bug me, first in multi player everyone can hear the bleet call as if they where using it when they dont have it out. it only takes one person to clear out a entire session. also when using some calls i notice where the clip for the audio begins and ends. this is only when im using headphones. but lastly the acuracy on some weapons is extrememly poor mostly the bow butt some rifles included. also i wish i had better audio mixing setting for example being about to turn down the volume for some things like the calls and the gunshots. but not effect ambiemt noises when doing so. more settings in general would be nice. also their is currently at the time of this post a bug that effects your scope and makes you relog when it happens in order to fix it.all in all this game is like a 6 out of 10. i really enjoy it but the little things irritate the heck out of me.

												Great game with great features. My fewcomplaints arethe incompatibility of the controller with the map and inventory and basically the whole menu ui. The lack of power the players that aren't host have in multiplayer, such as not being able to buy outposts or unlock lookouts. Also if they just added all the features of the free (the Hunter) like the guns and all the animals and maps. Which i hope in the future they will. This game would be a solid 10/10. For now its an 8/10 due to the lack of things to do after unlocking all the items. Waiting for the patch where they take everything from their other game over to this one.			"

												Everything about the game, graphics, scenery, AI and much more are 100% phenomenal. I have been complete emersefied in the game since purchase. I like everything about it and would recommened it to any one that loves hunting with a few exceptions as listed below. 1.) Sometimes the animals glitch out while walking/running or after being shot. 2.) So far i have discovered a few watch towers and 1 camp, which gives you rewards such as perks, cash or skill points. The one thing i have noticed each time is i don't actually recieve my perk points, has happened 3 or 4 times now and mainly on finding the watch towers and a couple other times on some other things. I do how ever receive them for leveling up though just fine. 3.) I don't know if it has to do with how im playing or not but there seems to be a bit of lack on animal species spawn rates. Out of the 16+hrs played i see an animal on average of 1 time every 45mins of real world time not game time. I do however know the game is different if a new game is started up again and i mean new as is starting all over at level 1. The first time there seemed to be more spawn rates. I only started a new game as i was only level 3 and the wife wanted to learn how to play as well.4.) Currency relative to game play builds and purchases. I feel the game is a little over priced on guns,bows and ammo as prices range from 10,000 to 60,000 for rifles and ammo starts as 350.00 for maybe 5 to 10 shells, as i have spent 1000.00 on ammo for the .243 (starting rifle) and received around 60-80 rounds. The building cost of the stands vs animal kill cash prizes and other world findings is a little high as well, say around 25% higher than i think it should be. Im all the time building stands and but that cost effected me being able to purchase better guns.			"

Product received for free
												This is both a great game, and kind of meh at the same time. My first impressions of the game is its beautiful - followed by - ""♥♥♥♥ me, this games setting has me hunting in europe? i've only ever hunted in the backwoods of the USA.... wonder what this will be like?"" followed quickly by a murdering rampage though the hills, :D.  in the span of 100 minutes I killed 5 Roe deer, 2 foxes, and 1 fallow deer.  But thats where the game starts to break down. The Good - This game is great for casual hunting, and by that i mean its a great pick up and shoot stuff hunter - not  much required in the way of getting started. You are given a decent set up right from the get go, you arn't required to buy hunting licenses or anything like that, and since the game is set up as a Arcade shooter - you can kill as manythings as you want - no bag limits :D. The Bad - For anyone looking for a more realistic hunting game this isn't going to be your bread and butter. This game is very beautiful however, it is not a deer hunter replacement. I never had to sight my gun, prep for my trip, buy hunting licenses, there was nothing in this game that made it feel like anything more than a casual arcade mode hunting game. Deer and wildlife are extreamly easy to track from the very begining since tracks light up and glow for you to track the game. The Ugly -  Its a bit buggy in a few areas - I got attacked by a rock and lost half my health walking down a steep hill :P. Another kind of disapointing feature is the scorecard system - For example, I shot a deer and missed its lung (the hold your breath is extramly short starting out) and shot the deer in the stomach - it didnt go down right away as to be expected and ran off and died around 200 meters away. Upon collecting the ""Trophy"" A score card is presented and then I was given a rather high score for botching this kill. Most anyone who hunts knows this was not a clean kill - the animal,  if this were in real life,  suffered immensly before dying of bloodloss and exhuastion.  I further tested this out and shot a deer resting in the face - Bang ""trick shot"" achievement - thats when it set in for me that this game was not going to come close to being a deer hunter replacment. All in all though - its a great game that seems to have a team deadicated to fixing the game and improving it - its just not going to scratch the itch of being a real hunting simulator to get you through waiting for the next hunting season.

												Not every game is a full on shooter, Not every gamer wants a full time shooter. I played the original Hunter game and the Mini transactions were a big put off. If you liked that game but not the transactions, then this one is spot on. This is graphicly a lot better and playwise, a lot more to offer. I was hesitant as the original one left me feeling like an open wallet and that the game would require constant funding. This is how it should have been released to start with.Definatly enjoying my experience now.			"

												POTENTIALLY AVOID THIS IF YOU ARE NOT INTO HUNTING OR HAVE THE PATIENCE TO HUNT - it can be tedious and boring.The graphics might look great - in fact they are great and very natural-looking graphics; however, this game can be incredibly boring and tedious to play - because it is an outright hunting simulator.Most of the gameplay involves following 'pretend' tracks of 'pretend' prey - you may have to do this for an hour.You may eventually see something and shoot it and it will potentially run off injured.  You then track its blood trail for probably up to an hour hoping to find it dead.It has single player; however, there are no real options to make the game easier.  There are no difficulty levels.The novelty will wear off fast if you are not drawn into the hunting simulation.There is no fun wandering around a landscape praying for something to hunt.I recommend it to people who like hunting games/hunting - but casual players will probably not enjoy this.If this game had difficulty options - spawn rates, etc, etc, for single-player then, yes, I would recommend it more readily.Patience does reward you uthough - as you gain experience, you can unlock perks and skills that help you hunt; HOWEVER, a novice would probably want that capability from the start.It's not all about hunting - there are missions to do in the two main areas.  Places to find and unlock, etc.A more customisable single-player campaign would make this more intersting for non-hunters or potential hunters.Possibly something to pick up on a sale if you are wary of this game.

												Using a GTX 1070 for this review.The game looks amazing! The best i've seen so far in gaming.. the atmosphere is nice and weather effects are really nice ( wind,rain )Hunting animals requires sneaking ( in a hunter game ) but that is obvious, this is no BF1 so don't run in the forest and don't expect any animals. So that's all good! Animals behavior is good ( beside some bugs on animals getting stuck )  but i guess they work on that.The bad things so far are the UI and Multiplayer UI. You have such a good looking game but the whole UI, shop, multiplayer score screen are really below par! I hope you will work on that developer! Graphics: 10/10Sound: 8/10Gameplay 7/10 ( -1 point due to animal bugs ) UI : 4/10Multiplayer: 7/10 ( multiplayer works, but the UI is bad, work on that )Overall: 7/10 and if they fix the problems i mentioned the game is 8/10.

												theHunter: Call of the Wild by Avalanche Studios, Expansive Worlds and astragon Entertainment might just be the “ground-breaking open world hunting simulator” you’ve been waiting for. The game implements realistic animal behavior, ballistics, and even weather cycles. There is not much of a tutorial and the player is dropped into the world with a gun and a map. Although there are initial voice overs and some tips, the player is pretty much left to their own devices.In regards to gameplay, the tracking mechanic can prove to be both frustrating and exciting. This is perhaps what lends it so well to creating an immersive experience that feels pretty real. While deer don’t have glowing prints, it is difficult not to feel excited when you realize you are getting close to one of the many types of wildlife in the game. It is also important to be on edge because many of the animals can turn and attack at a moment’s notice. It is hard not to feel excited when you finally line up that shot and pull the trigger. This game’s ballistics really alter the success of each shot based off of distance and trajectory so accuracy matters.However, I did find a few issues with the game. Due to the sheer size of the map and it being rendered all at once, the game is both beautiful and sometimes laggy. When prone I noticed that the grass does not connect to the ground, which caused clipping and obstruct the path at times. The most noteable glitch was a moose stuck in a hillside that would not die until it was shot five times. This is a big deal when ammo is limited and weapons are difficult to unlock in the beginning. There is also an auto walk feature, which is nice when walking great distances, but problematic when collecting trophies. This is because when doing so the game does not pause and you can walk off a cliff, be attacked by a bear, or both in my case.You can read the full review here {LINK REMOVED}http://bit.ly/GCypher7336 "

												Still crashes after 2 patches on a GTX 1080, 1440p G-Sync monitor.This could be a really good game but there's one issue which ruins it for mouse+keyboard users, the lack of being able to move slowly. If you want to move slowly without creating max noise then you'll need a joypad, even then it's not great as there's such a fine line between faster speed and no speed, you can adjust some joypad settings but no setting to actually adjust sensitivity for walking. It also feels dumbed down, sure you can make things harder by removing glow for the tracks but it still feels dumbed down, seems to be over populated with animals, there's also a stupid feature called ""warning"", basically the creature will hear you and make it's voice sound. Why on earth have such a stupid feature, it's like the developers have said ok how can we make the player find the various creatures easily, stupid. I mean a creature isn't going to shout out a warning if you're getting close because you made too much noise, stupid and dumbed down.The game looks really nice, much better than the 1st game and runs great at Ultra setting but does crash some sessions.You basically level up through xp, buy things, do missions. As for competitions, if you're expecting them to be like hunter classic, forget it. It's poorly implimented, noone bothers with them, they're not global.Multiplayer is pointless without well run competitions, noone bothers with them.If you've never played classic thehunter then you might like it, but for those that played the ortginal you'll be let down somewhat despite the great graphics.I'll continue to play it and hope they improve things soon but can't really reccomend it as a successor to TheHunter because it falls short in many ways.

												Overall...probably one of the best hunting games to date. If you are looking for a casual hunting game this is it. Expect a lot of walking, a lot of crawling, finding animals needs zones to hide out at for awhile, etc. Cons:It feels like its early access. Currently has a lot of bugs and some game crashes. I still consider it worthwhile though, even in its beta state. The missions are kinda dumb. But you can just bypass them and do whatever you want. For example: the missions are currently arranged in a way that makes it almost by chance to complete some of them...such as the take a picture of 2 bears in one pic. I personally hate the photography missions. This will most likely be fixed at some point.... but the animals sometimes get stuck on rocks, or freeze in space. This also will at some point be added: more animals and more content. Pros:None of that monthly pay crap they had in the first one. This is the reason i bought this one and nothing from the first one. Free roam. You can follow the story missions, side quests, or do whatever you want. Some scenery is so gorgeous it could be a background for your monitor.Huge enormous reserves. I havent even been to every location in almost 40 hours of gameplay. Bleed outs from animalstracking.......you can literally spend an hour in real time tracking an animal that you shot, it you hit the flesh and no vitals. hunting pressure zones. If you shoot an animal in the same spot, they come around less, if not at all. History. Their past game shows that they will work one this game for years to come. Adding content, fixing bugs, etc. etc.Realistic features.... sounds, smells, and visuals can give you away as a hunter.  "

												It's an excellent simulator of what hunting really is and should be like. There are some annoyances that I HOPE the developers keep in mind when releasing future updates, but for the most part the game is excelent.Pro's1. This game is beautiful. It is taxing on the system, but I am able to play on a steady 30 fps, and the textures are all at least 4k. Its amazing and I definetly applaude the developers for making it so.2. Realism of the process of hunting is outstanding. It goes through all the steps, and doesnt make it overly simplified to find prints or track animals.3. Animal diversity is also quite astounding.Con's1. The A.I of the animals needs a lot of tweaking. This is a problem that should be able to be remedied, but it is something that needs to be fixed in the future if the game is to be succesful. It kinda takes the realism out of the game when you finally track down a deer stuck in a tree, and shoot it point blank. Take collision with trees off at least?But other than that, the game is fineThere is not a whole lot more to a hunting game than what it already has guys. This isnt bass pro;s either, so they dont have an entire warehouse arsenal of hunting equipment for you to choose from. It's just the way it is and I can understand it.Overall 7.5/10, If the A.I is fixed 10/10			"

												I had just spotted my first decent buck in Layton Lake and observed, attempting to get closer for a better shot. However, he quickly spooked and bolted off into the underbrush. I tracked him, but eventually gave up and decided to head for a nearby observation point and take in the scenery.I'd like to say, this game has perfectly captured how it feels to be in the woods. I hike occasionally during the summer and this is the first game I've ever seen that had me convinced my character was actually in a forest instead of just a clump of trees. The underbrush is great and the topogrophy is excellent. The way the lighting interacts with the trees and brush is absolutely perfect. Back to ingame, I continued along a path leading to the lookout tower. Then my attention was brought straight forward by the warning grunt of a black bear. I quickly dropped into a crouch and raised my rifle. Though some brush, I could see a bear with a cinnamon coat quartering towards me, coming along the path maybe 45 yards away. I lined up the reticle with the front of his shoulder, held my breath, pulled the trigger. He took a few more steps along the path, so I fired again, dropping him in his tracks.This is what you get when you purchase this product. A convincing virtual world and a rewarding experience. At times it's a painfully slow burner, but when you finally get that perfect shot you know that the game didn't give it to you. You earned it. P.S. to fans of turkey hunting, waterfowling and upland birds: They aren't currently included in the game but I have a strong suspicion they'll make their way in at some point.EDIT: I should mention there did seem to be a large infestation of bugs when the game was first released but it has been patched multiple times since release and I have yet to experience any game breaking bugs, just a few very minor graphical glitches.

It makes the world feel much more immersive and gives sort of an ambient feeling when hunting. (which in my opinion makes it less boring)- NO MICROTRANSACTIONS! The previous hunter was a P2W game. If you are thinking of playing the previous thehunter because ""oh oh oh, i dont want to buy this game but I still want to hunt for free bah baah blah"" then you\re on the wrong track. You can unlock all species immideatly and can get better weapons by grinding them.- Night hunting. Nuff said.- This is by far the best (and one of the only) hunting game out there. Hunting simulation is a genre where currently, you do not have much choice.Cons:- Absolute garbage UI.- Multiplayer cons:   - Can't claim lookout points or outposts in multiplayer unless you are the owner of the server   - Server browser is absolute trash with very few filtering options   - Zones that appear that animals avoid when an animal is shot in the area do not match up with guests and the host   - Sometimes guests and owners see different animals (happens very rarely!)   - and loads of other small bugs- ALL OF THE BUGS! Seriously this and the UI is by far the biggest issue I have with this game. There are SO many of them and you will encounter them EVERYWHERE! They are not gamebreaking and do not exactly do that much, but this just feels like that the developers have not tested this game AT ALL or it's just a beta version (however, the game has already had a closed beta)- No trophy shots- No baiting barrelsSo, conclusion:If you want a hunting game, play the original TheHunter for a few hours and see if you like the waiting, the having to endlessly be careful not to sppok an animal and so on. If you do, buy this game! It's better than the original in almost every way (of course, except the bugs). It's a great game. There are none that compare to this. It's quite fun to play by yourself and even better if you play with your friends.			"

												Still crashes after 2 patches on a GTX 1080, 1440p G-Sync monitor.This could be a really good game but there's one issue which ruins it for mouse+keyboard users, the lack of being able to move slowly. If you want to move slowly without creating max noise then you'll need a joypad, even then it's not great as there's such a fine line between faster speed and no speed, you can adjust some joypad settings but no setting to actually adjust sensitivity for walking. It also feels dumbed down, sure you can make things harder by removing glow for the tracks but it still feels dumbed down, seems to be over populated with animals, there's also a stupid feature called ""warning"", basically the creature will hear you and make it's voice sound. Why on earth have such a stupid feature, it's like the developers have said ok how can we make the player find the various creatures easily, stupid. I mean a creature isn't going to shout out a warning if you're getting close because you made too much noise, stupid and dumbed down.The game looks really nice, much better than the 1st game and runs great at Ultra setting but does crash some sessions.You basically level up through xp, buy things, do missions. As for competitions, if you're expecting them to be like hunter classic, forget it. It's poorly implimented, noone bothers with them, they're not global.Multiplayer is pointless without well run competitions, noone bothers with them.If you've never played classic thehunter then you might like it, but for those that played the ortginal you'll be let down somewhat despite the great graphics.I'll continue to play it and hope they improve things soon but can't really reccomend it as a successor to TheHunter because it falls short in many ways.

												Multiplayer dosent have any feutures from single player,  all u can do is shoot animals and get money. So when ur ammo runs out u have to go back to single player to get ammo. And there is no return to menu option. So if u want to switch from multi to single or the other way around u have to restart the game.			"

												Overall...probably one of the best hunting games to date. If you are looking for a casual hunting game this is it. Expect a lot of walking, a lot of crawling, finding animals needs zones to hide out at for awhile, etc. Cons:It feels like its early access. Currently has a lot of bugs and some game crashes. I still consider it worthwhile though, even in its beta state. The missions are kinda dumb. But you can just bypass them and do whatever you want. For example: the missions are currently arranged in a way that makes it almost by chance to complete some of them...such as the take a picture of 2 bears in one pic. I personally hate the photography missions. This will most likely be fixed at some point.... but the animals sometimes get stuck on rocks, or freeze in space. This also will at some point be added: more animals and more content. Pros:None of that monthly pay crap they had in the first one. This is the reason i bought this one and nothing from the first one. Free roam. You can follow the story missions, side quests, or do whatever you want. Some scenery is so gorgeous it could be a background for your monitor.Huge enormous reserves. I havent even been to every location in almost 40 hours of gameplay. Bleed outs from animalstracking.......you can literally spend an hour in real time tracking an animal that you shot, it you hit the flesh and no vitals. hunting pressure zones. If you shoot an animal in the same spot, they come around less, if not at all. History. Their past game shows that they will work one this game for years to come. Adding content, fixing bugs, etc. etc.Realistic features.... sounds, smells, and visuals can give you away as a hunter.  "

												It's an excellent simulator of what hunting really is and should be like. There are some annoyances that I HOPE the developers keep in mind when releasing future updates, but for the most part the game is excelent.Pro's1. This game is beautiful. It is taxing on the system, but I am able to play on a steady 30 fps, and the textures are all at least 4k. Its amazing and I definetly applaude the developers for making it so.2. Realism of the process of hunting is outstanding. It goes through all the steps, and doesnt make it overly simplified to find prints or track animals.3. Animal diversity is also quite astounding.Con's1. The A.I of the animals needs a lot of tweaking. This is a problem that should be able to be remedied, but it is something that needs to be fixed in the future if the game is to be succesful. It kinda takes the realism out of the game when you finally track down a deer stuck in a tree, and shoot it point blank. Take collision with trees off at least?But other than that, the game is fineThere is not a whole lot more to a hunting game than what it already has guys. This isnt bass pro;s either, so they dont have an entire warehouse arsenal of hunting equipment for you to choose from. It's just the way it is and I can understand it.Overall 7.5/10, If the A.I is fixed 10/10			"

												Great game so far! I have never seen a game with this much atmosphere. I actually turned down the tracking highlights because you can actually track animals without them! The gras and terrain give clues and paths that animals have obviously taken. It is amazing! Great game. Definently worth the buy! They have GONE AWAY from microtransactions and have already added FREE DLC. NOW, there are a few glitches but they are definelty not game breaking. They also just throw you into the world which is quite fun and awesome to explore and discover all the amazing ♥♥♥♥ this game has to offer! for $30 this game is amazing.

												I picked up this game and started playing it on average computer. It was nice but I realized it was not running as it should. I was ready to give it up. Then I decided to buy a new gaming pc OMG this game comes to life on a good computer, gone is the slow hunter. I am the Ben Johnson of hunters!! This game is amazing in so many ways.if you are looking for easy go play something else. You have to treat this game like real life. Do you have a tutorial in real life?? I don't! You also won't start to enjoy the game until you get to around level 4. Have you ever been driving late at night and you are a little tired on a two lane highway? You know when your trying to stay awake and think ever bush is a deer or moose about to jump in front of you?? This  game does that!!  You swear that I'm the distance deer are bushes you squint your eyes trying to see but no that's just a bush not a deer!! Lol The people that say there are no animals? Just like real life the animals on this game are WILD!! Do you think they want to be shot and killed and eaten by me?? Heck no. They run and hide when they hear your noisy ♥♥♥ coming. They smell your old spice aftershave you splashed on this morning. Don't be stupid!! WILD animals are smarter than you!!You have to go slow, sure you can run to a place. But then your sure going to have to wait for things to calm down again after all the human noise you just made!!I myself have encountered very few problems with the game now that I'm running a 1070 video card and i7 processor. I'm on max setting on everything and it looks and feels like real life.The calls take a bit to get used to. Start with the small black one it travels further. The deer will come to you after awhile in the right location. When they get a little closer switch to the can call. I had one today come so close he was almost on top of me!!! Then I was so excited I missed from 5feet  away lol . Just remember if you kill something move on because that area is full of the animals dead smell now lol great feature, it makes you move on and explore more.This is bar none the best and most realist hunting game out there by far!!  I have much more to unlock and I am super happy with how it's going so far. I can't wait to see what else is in here!Great game with so many options on what you can do. Walk around or just find a place to bring them in. Buy this if you have the computer to run it! And they taste great too!!			"

Cooking your catch for meals to keep your morale up.3. A bicycle that you could style to move around the huge park.4. Fishing.5. Decorating your bunk with your hunt.6. Cleaning and maintainance to your rifle/weapons.7. Firing range for practises.8. Make clothing have progression, better gloves and better clothing / shoes for hunting purposes.			"

												This is the best game about hunting, since it best conveys the atmosphere of the forest which is the most important.The game lacks only transport for example - a mountain bike and even more diverse types of weapons, maps, animals, birds for prey and ideally add fishing.Optimization for such graphics is the best, - 15 FPS maximum deviation from the norm.

												First Steam review so bear with me...The Basics: A hunting ""simulator"" that drops you into a massive map with a gun in your hand a somewhat helpful voice in your ear. No real setup, just cuts you loose with some very basic and in my opinion decent enough tutorial messages. You could follow the missions that pop up on your huntermate or ignore them. As far as I can tell, nothing is gated behind the completion of any of them. So as soon as you start you can do as you please, unlock outposts, lookout points and other assorted collectibles around the land. Not to mention trying to land your first, of many, kills.Graphics: Game is gorgeous as hell. Dense forests that give way to open fields, lakes and rivers carving through the hills. Its just a treat to look at. Not to mention the animals are very well done also. Though if I'm honest (and that's the point right?) the animals could maybe use a second albeit small touch up. Nothing a non critical eye would notice. I can't help but feel like this is the way game maps were supposed to be designed from the beginning. It's so great walking through the bushes and branches hoping that you can get a shot on a deer you can barely makeout in the distance. There are a few low texture and blurry bits but I was too awestruck to notice until the five hour mark. Sound: The sounds are great and not great. Mixed bag. Mainly some are too loud. Some are recycled leading to confusion and some are kind of odd. The rain is an example of excellence. I absolutely love the rain in this game. It truly feels like I am standing in the forest in a storm, and when thunder occurs, I nearly jumped from my seat. Example of bad sound is when for instance, a rabbit takes off from a few feet from you. Not only is it loud as balls, but it makes the same sound as your polyester jacket scraping tree branches. Sounds like this being repeated led to me constantly wondering if a deer responded to my calls, a rabbit got startled, or I'm just molesting a tree. Another positive though, the voiceovers are quite nice. (at least so far)Gameplay: It's an incredibly simple premise done quite well. You go into the forest and shoot animals. Main drive is to bag the biggest and best you can. It's a very addictive cycle for myself. The game makes it very easy to decide whats worth you ammo. You get experience for better kills ie right tool for the animal, quick kills, and better trophies. You also level up your skill with a particular weapon or tool type which opens up new variants at an oupost. There are perks and skills that allow you to alleviate the difficulty in subtle and so far non game breaking ways.ETC: The main gripe here with most people is the grind. It takes a long time to begin unlocking things. Me personally though, the gun you start with is more than sufficient and games like these aren't about racing to the end, it's the journey along the way. Other issues are that when playing with a keyboard and mouse it's currently impossible to sneak effectively. No matter the stance you make hella noise moving through any kind of underbrush. And yes, there are reports of quite a few assorted bugs. Missing ammo, scopes not working, animals glitching out. I haven't personally experienced these but I feel for those who are. I trust that given a little bit of time, the dev team will iron these things out and build upon the solid foundation that they have laid. Even the early days of the Hunter classic were an ugly time.  TLDR: Buggy, beautiful, and fun as hell. When it comes down to it, this game at its worst is miles better than any other hunting game at it's best.  "

												After patch 1.5 I would recommend it. You get a LOT for 30€. Two Massive reserves with best representation of digital nature to date. It took almost 70 hours just to explore all points of interest, lodges, outposts etc. on both maps. While hunting in between of course. Enough different animals to keep you busy for a while. The game still has some minor problems and a few major ones for a couple of players. Devs are fixing bugs on a weekly basis. DLC's paid and free will come. A truly relaxing and beautiful game. Just opening a cold one while walking around and taking pictures takes the stress of the day off. P.S.You need a decent PC. Well done!			"

												This is for anyone who has yet to purchase TheHunter: Call of the Wild.So far I have clocked in over 10 hours + playing TheHunter and from what I have seen so far the game has a lot of good, bad, and broken in it.Bad points:-The menu doesn’t work half the time, doing something as simple as switching weapons can take me 10-15 min’s just trying to get it to work sometimes.-Frame rate drops from time to time.(I have a higher end PC)-Animals get stuck all the time, in my 10+ hours it has happened more than a few times.One time I wiped out an entire herd, just walked up to them and popped them all one at a time.-Can fall quite a distance with taking minimal damage, but fall a few inches next to a rock and you die?-The sound the game makes when you brush up against… brush doesn’t sound right to me. When I walk through brush I turn around time after time because it sounds like it's off in the distance and not me making the noise. Might just be me though but drove me nuts!-The most success I had hunting was running through the forest, not sneaking. It is still way more realistic than other hunting games, but I shouldn’t be able to jog up a road and drop 5 animals.-Do not try to switch keybindings or you might get stuck for a bit. If you already messed with the shoot button just scroll down to the bottom and reset everything and don’t touch it until patches fix that monstrosity.-Few crashes throughout the day.-Sound sometimes cuts in and out, usually when it’s raining.-Camo does nothing...The GOOD!-Graphics Look AMAZING, game does need to be optimized a bit though.-It feels like a new game but does keep a lot of the core components of the original game, If you played TheHunter Classic you will feel at home with this game.-MASSIVE BEAUTIFUL world.-I am satisfied every time I pull the trigger, and the animal animations are awesome.(when they aren’t stuck running in place from a rock,tree, or one foot hill) The game has a lot wrong with it right now, I have no doubt that the game was rushed out. A lot of the problems seem like they could be quick fixes, but these problems should have NOT been in the release. And testing for more than an hour or two would have pinpointed the problems easily. But with all of that the game is still great, I have enjoyed spending the whole day on the game and haven’t felt bored. So for a new buyer I would have to say hold off until they fix a few of the bugs. The game is not unplayable by any means but I feel like some standards need to be held, especially for a $30 game.

												I really want to like this game, I sent the devs an email and they reassured me that the game will get its patches. I can definetly see why people would be concerned about their commitment, the game is still in its extremely early stages and should be marked as so. This game has a ton of work that needs to be done. I will name off some of the things that bother me.  1st thing that makes me frustrated is how weak the weapons are, a Headshot with a 12 gauge shot is not enough for a deer apperantly. After still dumping another 4 slugs into it, the deer managed to survive with it only having a blood rate of low. Same thing goes for the bow. While I understand that their is a point to chase them down and finishing the job but having to do that everytime with any weapon but the rifle is a little excessive.  Next thing on my list is having to walk everywhere. you can only fast travel to the one campground so I try to avoid the missions because the map is so huge. While I understand that you should explore the map, it really bugs me having to fast travel to the one camp on the map after a mission to rest until sundown then have to do a 15 minute walk back to the same area from your last mission to hunt the same animals at night.  My final issue with the game is the prices of the items, while they lowered the cost of the actual firearms on the latest patch they raised the price of ammo making it ridiculous to actually get far. Once you purchase a weapon you barely are left with any money to buy ammo. It wouldnt be so bad but when animals only garnish ~$600 and you dump 5 out of 8 slugs into it you end not being able to afford it because you only get 8 slugs for $980.The good things about the game are the graphics, the sounds, and the generally calming expirience of hunting. The AI is pretty decent when they dont run around in circles or get stuck between the rocks.  Tracking deer is an exciting experience with the help of the phone, when its not killing your fps it really helps out. Not a ton to hunt from yet, the deer seem to be more aggressive than a black bear when shot. Not sure if thats %100 accurate. Also something to note, this game requires patience. Unfortunately you cant run up to any deer and shoot them willy nilly. You actually have crouch and crawl to get close, if they dont pick up your scent from the gust of wind. Weapon selection is decent, they start you from a rifle and after a couple kills you can afford handguns, shotguns and, bows. From there you can customize them by adding a sight or getting better ammo. If you do get the bow I recommend restarting your game if want you use your rifle with a scope, bugs out and doesnt work right.All in all its a great game but there is a ton and i mean a TON of work that needs to be done before this is even considered an actual game. At the moment as I write this review I do not reccomend this to anyone yet. Wait until a couple good solid patches are released. Until then my review will stay the same status unless they adjust it to an early access title.

												This is for anyone who has yet to purchase TheHunter: Call of the Wild.So far I have clocked in over 10 hours + playing TheHunter and from what I have seen so far the game has a lot of good, bad, and broken in it.Bad points:-The menu doesn’t work half the time, doing something as simple as switching weapons can take me 10-15 min’s just trying to get it to work sometimes.-Frame rate drops from time to time.(I have a higher end PC)-Animals get stuck all the time, in my 10+ hours it has happened more than a few times.One time I wiped out an entire herd, just walked up to them and popped them all one at a time.-Can fall quite a distance with taking minimal damage, but fall a few inches next to a rock and you die?-The sound the game makes when you brush up against… brush doesn’t sound right to me. When I walk through brush I turn around time after time because it sounds like it's off in the distance and not me making the noise. Might just be me though but drove me nuts!-The most success I had hunting was running through the forest, not sneaking. It is still way more realistic than other hunting games, but I shouldn’t be able to jog up a road and drop 5 animals.-Do not try to switch keybindings or you might get stuck for a bit. If you already messed with the shoot button just scroll down to the bottom and reset everything and don’t touch it until patches fix that monstrosity.-Few crashes throughout the day.-Sound sometimes cuts in and out, usually when it’s raining.-Camo does nothing...The GOOD!-Graphics Look AMAZING, game does need to be optimized a bit though.-It feels like a new game but does keep a lot of the core components of the original game, If you played TheHunter Classic you will feel at home with this game.-MASSIVE BEAUTIFUL world.-I am satisfied every time I pull the trigger, and the animal animations are awesome.(when they aren’t stuck running in place from a rock,tree, or one foot hill) The game has a lot wrong with it right now, I have no doubt that the game was rushed out. A lot of the problems seem like they could be quick fixes, but these problems should have NOT been in the release. And testing for more than an hour or two would have pinpointed the problems easily. But with all of that the game is still great, I have enjoyed spending the whole day on the game and haven’t felt bored. So for a new buyer I would have to say hold off until they fix a few of the bugs. The game is not unplayable by any means but I feel like some standards need to be held, especially for a $30 game.

												I really want to like this game, I sent the devs an email and they reassured me that the game will get its patches. I can definetly see why people would be concerned about their commitment, the game is still in its extremely early stages and should be marked as so. This game has a ton of work that needs to be done. I will name off some of the things that bother me.  1st thing that makes me frustrated is how weak the weapons are, a Headshot with a 12 gauge shot is not enough for a deer apperantly. After still dumping another 4 slugs into it, the deer managed to survive with it only having a blood rate of low. Same thing goes for the bow. While I understand that their is a point to chase them down and finishing the job but having to do that everytime with any weapon but the rifle is a little excessive.  Next thing on my list is having to walk everywhere. you can only fast travel to the one campground so I try to avoid the missions because the map is so huge. While I understand that you should explore the map, it really bugs me having to fast travel to the one camp on the map after a mission to rest until sundown then have to do a 15 minute walk back to the same area from your last mission to hunt the same animals at night.  My final issue with the game is the prices of the items, while they lowered the cost of the actual firearms on the latest patch they raised the price of ammo making it ridiculous to actually get far. Once you purchase a weapon you barely are left with any money to buy ammo. It wouldnt be so bad but when animals only garnish ~$600 and you dump 5 out of 8 slugs into it you end not being able to afford it because you only get 8 slugs for $980.The good things about the game are the graphics, the sounds, and the generally calming expirience of hunting. The AI is pretty decent when they dont run around in circles or get stuck between the rocks.  Tracking deer is an exciting experience with the help of the phone, when its not killing your fps it really helps out. Not a ton to hunt from yet, the deer seem to be more aggressive than a black bear when shot. Not sure if thats %100 accurate. Also something to note, this game requires patience. Unfortunately you cant run up to any deer and shoot them willy nilly. You actually have crouch and crawl to get close, if they dont pick up your scent from the gust of wind. Weapon selection is decent, they start you from a rifle and after a couple kills you can afford handguns, shotguns and, bows. From there you can customize them by adding a sight or getting better ammo. If you do get the bow I recommend restarting your game if want you use your rifle with a scope, bugs out and doesnt work right.All in all its a great game but there is a ton and i mean a TON of work that needs to be done before this is even considered an actual game. At the moment as I write this review I do not reccomend this to anyone yet. Wait until a couple good solid patches are released. Until then my review will stay the same status unless they adjust it to an early access title. I believe that this game has a lot of potential and can easily be the greatest hunting game ever but the devs have a lot of work on their hands. TL;DR Don't buy yet.			"

												Should be an early access game. Lots of unfinished descriptions on weapons. Unbalanced stats on tools and weapons. Broken hitboxes and bullet clipping (Shot a deer point blank in the heart, said I got his spine). Missing ""Return to main menu"" button (Lol?). Optimization needs some tuning. Ai needs some touch ups. But after all that, the game looks pretty in ultra, it has great potential, no micro-transactions, my entire map has become purple, get destroyed by three bears at once and can become robbin hood with my trusty bow. I suggest faster ways of getting around such as an atv or pick-up. Im sure devs are already on that. But overall I see great potential in this game.			"

If you go into this game without comparing it, you will appreciate and enjoy the experience much more.			"

												I really like this game and I'm glad I didn't let the negative reviews deter me. It does have some issues with the occasional crash and animals getting stuck, but overall it is an enjoyable experiance. The environment and sounds are incredible, by far one of the most immersive games I've ever played. It's challenging in that you can't just run around and shoot. You need to have patience and think about your approach when tracking. I've found that using a combination of keyboard/mouse for the interfaces and a controller for normal gameplay to be the best, but there are improvements that could be made on both sides. The interfaces do not work well with the controller, but the controller does provide the advantage of taking a slow approach when stalking.			"

												This game has met all my expectations and a little more even, yea it has bugs but the devs are working on fixes around the clock. first ill start off with the pros.PROS- Sound quality is extremly detailed and some of the best ive heard in any outdoor/hunting game (sounds just like real life imo)- The graphics are really good compared to classic- The environments and animals are incredibly detailed and super realistic- Animations look as life like as if you were actually watching a real deer- AI is decent although it could be better (for example the animals call way to often and ocasionally walk into trees and get stuck)- The missions are fun and keep you wanting to play more of them- The reserves are absolutely massive and it would definitly take a long time to have explored every inch of hunting area- One time purchase with no micro transactions whatsoever (A big improvement over TheHunter classic)- Leveling seems balanced although if you dont play some of the missions it will take significantly longer to progress- the animals act in the ways they would in real life (for example the elk are found commonly in herds of 15+ and stick together when traveling, the animals react to getting shot very realisticly too)CONS-The frame rate is a little low compared to what my pc should be getting ( i have a gtx 970, 3.5ghz 8 core processor, 16gb ram, 750 watt power supply and i get 50-80 fps on high)- It takes way too long to unlock new guns/equipment ( ive played 16 hours since release and ive only unlocked 1 new rifle after 80+ kills)-Their isnt as much veriety in antler variation as i would like (compared to classic atleast)- Its too easy to find large trophys, it should be more difficult to find the bigger trophys and smaller ones should be more common but instead its the other way around in this game- There are quite a bit of bugs as of now but they are putting out patches every day so its not a huge problemOver all i really have enjoyed the game and i would definitly recommend it to anyone who likes hunting or just wants a beautiful looking game to play. Sure its not perfect but its definitly worth the 29.99 and the devs are working hard on improving the game and are actually listening to the feedback they are getting. Cant wait to see what the future hold for this game!!!			"

												Update: It's now been revealed this is in fact a console port, an unfinished buggy console port sold at full price in a beta condition.This is the worst gaming experience I have had in over 20 years of gaming and this is the first game I have deleted permanently from my steam accounts, I am done with this game.Kudos to those who allow themselves to be treated this way, I am not one of them.The forums are run by fanboys who delete and ban people for the slightest criticism of their precious little game, I was unaware people this weak minded existed.So go ♥♥♥♥ yourself AlfTupper, should our paths ever cross in real life the outcome will be very very different of that I can assure you.It beggars belief how this game was released as ""game ready"", little has been fixed with the patching to date and the unfinished state of this game is apparent every time you try and play, each patch brings with it new bugs to add to the ever growing Big Bug Report Thread, If you're happy to spend £30 to join a Beta program then buy it.This game delivers graphically but is left wanting in all other departments, I suggest you read the current bugs/unfinished features list before buying.http://steamcommunity.com/app/518790/discussions/5/133258092257803156/Flawed AI, stuck animals, disappearing animals, broken caller animations, broken animal animations, missing animal animations, broken tracking, the sound balance and positioning is crude and undeveloped, The UI is an abomination of design and navigation etc, the list is endless and each subsequent patch brings more and more bugs to the game.Deathly silence in the forums from the Devs other than a few token ""marketing"" style posts, they are happy to sit back and watch the forum fall apart whilst spending most of their time on the review section posting ""damage limitation"" responses to negative reviews. 1000's of questions are asked but not a single one is addressed by the devs, the ""community"" is left to argue amongst itself.The forum moderators are hand picked from the original beta testing team so it's pretty clear where their loyalties lie, the forums are bias to the extreme, anyone criticising the game or it's developers are jumped on by the die hard fan base with calls of ""cryer"" ""whiner"" or ""your computers a potato"" resulting in flaming and threads being (conveniently) locked and posts being (conveniently) deleted.I can't for one second recommend anybody purchase this game in it's current state, yes the game looks good, yes it draws you in and immerses you into the environment, then it proceeds to slowly reveal flaw upon immersion breaking flaw to ruin the experience, If your gaming requirements are slightly above average you are in for a frustrating experience, if you like to run around a pretty environment oblivious of the bugs, shooting anything that moves, ""high fiving"" every kill and taking screenshots you will love it.Until I see active participation in the forums by the devs, I'm considering it a waste of time and energy suggestion improvements, these guys have their roadmap and everybody else is well and truly on it, just like their previous titles, do your research on Avalanche Studios and Expansive Worlds, put the hype aside and take a look at their track record with theHunter Classic, and Primal, these guys have a history of not finishing things.It's too early to give a detailed review because the game isn't yet ""game ready"".

												habe das game jetzt ca. 4 stunden gespielt. nur im Multiplayer mit Freunden... leider musste ich feststellen das der Multiplayer nur für den Host ""attraktiv"" ist. Denn es ist nur dem Host möglich, die einzelnen Map-Punkte (u.a. ""Aussenposten"" ""interessante Orte"" und ""Aussichtspunkte"") zu erkunden. Die anderen Mitspieler können lediglich Jagen und dafür Punkte bekommen. Apro pos Punkte: Diese werden auch nur dann verteilt wenn man auf ein Tier geschossen hat, wenn dem nicht so ist, bekommt man rein gar nichts....Fazit:-) Multiplayer sollte ausgereift werden - alle Mitspieler sollten Waypoint aktivieren können.-) Gemeinsames Jagen sollte verbessert werden - Belohnungen beim Jagen sollten alle erhaltne, nicht nur wenn man draufgeschossen hat.-) Falldamage anpassen, da nicht realistisch. Man kann von einem Aussichtspunkt hinunter springen und man erleidet einen sehr geringen Schaden! Beim Springen auf eine Holzbank ist man tot. usw.-) Zielfernrohr ist manchmal verbuggt - das zoomen bei der Waffe funktioniert nicht korrekt, man sieht durch das Zielfernrorh und sieht dabei seine Hände und das Rohr ist extrem klein!-) Menü funktioniert nicht korrekt: Eine Auswahl ist manchmal nicht möglich, man muss 2-3 mal klicken.-) Muitionskauf: Man kann diese zwar kaufen, aber man sieht nicht wieviel Munition man gekauft hat. Nur wenn man aus dem Menü raus geht und die Waffe auswählt. Im ""Lager"" wird die Munition ebenfalls irgendwann angezeigt...-) Kein Zurück zum Haupt-Menü: Man muss andauernd das Spiel beenden und neustarten.-) usw. - ich hoffe die Entwickler sehen diesen Beitrag und werden diese Bugs ausbessern.... leider ist es mir nicht mehr möglich das Spiel zurückzugeben, sonst würde ich das auch machen!Für mich ist es eine Alpha-Versiojn und überhaupt nicht ausgereift! - Unbedingt Updates notwendig! - Keine Kaufempfehlung!

												If you liked theHunter Classic then you will, for the most part, like this game. The sound design is great (with the exception of animals and players walking through brush. It just sounds off). The graphics are top notch. The game could use some performance tweaks. My FPS seems to be all over the place with an I7-4790k and a GTX 970.

												The game is fun in the begining then turns to garbage.   The gripe is after playing for a while the game crashes consistantly and often becoming unplayable.  From what I've read the issue is known but still in the works for a fix.  Save your money until they fix it.			"

												The slow pace of hunting, the minimalistic UI, the sounds, and gorgeous graphics makes theHunter an impressively immersive experience that manages to be pretty relaxing and thrilling at the same time. The gameplay is in my short experience pretty simplistic, which is probably a necessity given that it's a pretty unique game. You find a trace, you follow it, you shoot the animal, everybody happy. It certainly has depth though, and the world feels very alive, despite pretty much just being you, the land, and the animals. I would attribute this to the AI of the animals combined with the mechanics of the world more than anything, as they'll pretty realistically react to noises, sightings, et cetera.My main gripes with the game seem to be things that will hopefully be improved upon in later patches. Namely, the tutorial is more or less just text boxes popping up every once in a while. Even though learning through playing might work, there's a good few mechanics that just aren't explained all that well and given how this isn't a common/mainstream type of game, a proper tutorial would really make it easier to get into the game.Secondly there's a slight lack of polish in some areas. Menus are a bit clunky and there are some smaller graphical bugs. The positional audio could use some work too, it would be an amazing asset to the immersion but there's just something off about it in terms of volume levels and direction.			"

												theHunter Call of The Wild is a great game. It's beautiful and has a lot to offer. Hunting seems to be much more improved in this game than the previous hunter and it's nice that you don't have to pay monthly to hunt where you want and what you want. Although it's very hard to ignore the obvious bugs in the game. Sometimes your game will crash, FPS drops aren't common but they happen, your mission progress will get stuck and force you to restart your save, scope glitches when you fire making it difficult to track a animal after you shot, animals will sometimes get stuck, and tracks can completetly disappear forcing you to restart the game. The game is a lot of fun and has a lot of potential. Most definitetly a step up from the previous game. Much more improved mechhanics and several new weapons as well. If you're able to withstand the crashes and bugs this game has then I would definitetly say buy it especially if you're a fan of the previous game. When the game works as intended it's a blast to play and I don't regret buying it at all. Hopefully the devs keep to this game and don't abandon it like they did with theHunter Primal.			"

												A beautiful game, runs smooth as butter.(Although i have noticed a few minor bugs with tracking animals)  It definitley isn't the classic ""theHunter"" game, but for $35 it does away with the micro-transactions & season subscriptions to introduce a great reward/unlock system. If you have a large amount of time/money invested into the original stick with that, but if your new to ""theHunter"" this is your chane to experience the finest in hunting simulators>			"

												TLDR:The game is playable and enjoyable but riddled with bugs so much so you might mistake this game for an early access rather than an actual game release. The gameplay itself is simple but even then the AI of the animals is lacking in so many ways with pathfinding issues. I'd say that in my 300 ""harvests"" of animals that around 1/3 of those were from ""bugged animals"" which were either standing still, running in place or stuck on the terrain. I didnt buy a hunting game only to be shooting fish in a barrel.Running the game on Max settings GTX 1080 i7-6500 3.4Ghz 16gig RAM rig runs the game perfectly, suffer from random audio crashes that have yet to be fixed despite many people suffering from it.Single player missions are a joke, often asking you to take a picture of a deer but the quest itself is bugged and no amount of pictures or the distance you are to the deer will make a difference. With the latest patch the developers essentially ripped away whatever progression system the game has, the idea is that you hunt animals and gain EXP, weapon experience and money. The developers have made it possible to essentially have end game gear within hours of playing by drastically reducing the amouint of experience needed to unlock these weapons (seriously i'd say they reduced the amount needed by about 80%). So now i have the end game weapons and can kill animals easily from an enormous distance so now what? I could go ahead and try and hunt the biggest trophies in the game for the bragging rights on the global leaderboards like in theHunter classic? WRONG. There is a leaderboards amongst your friend list but thats it and even then it isnt even working right now and doesnt update itself often.The game is nothing like a hunting game, if you think you are going to be sneaking up on groups of animals, picking out the biggest trophy and taking it down then think again! The game as it is punishes players who just hunt for trophies as far as progression is concerned. It's actually more beneficial for to kill every animal you see no matter what size or gender than going for a trophy, the difference in rewards between a trophy and a crappy female deer is tiny, maybe a third less money and EXP, the game doesnt even punish you for killing an animal with the wrong weapon nor does it punish you for failing to track a wounded animal down and finishing it off. so it gets to a point where you just shoot an animal and if you find that its barely wounded your better off just leaving it and finding some other animal to shoot at.If the developers want this game to last longer than a few months then they really need to make some major changes to this game, which is a shame because it could be a very good game once they fixed all the bugs and actually made it feel like you were hunting rather than playing some arcade shoot em up with deers instead of zombies.WIll change this review once game becomes more playable but if anyone is reading this right now please save your money for now, watch this game and keep an eye on its updates and maybe even catch it in a steam sale a few months down the line.

												Hello everyone! I really hope this review can help you wether buy the game or not, so lets get into it.theHunter: Call of the Wild has the potential to become the best and bigger hunting game in the market so far...I've been playing it for a while and I'm not dissapointed for the price.HOWEVER, there are still many small and medium bugs that need to be fixed in order to give the customer a proper game experience.How is that? I will explain it now.Some little bugs like sound glitches such as choppy rain effect when you are anywhere near a lake or river (10 meters or so) or the scope dissapearing for half a second when you shoot (only 2 out of 10 shots)The bugs that I'm more worried about is that the game GUI is completely unfriendly. I mean, I cannot change the mouse sensitivity since the mouse/keyboard does NOT have an ""Apply"" button, and when it comes to the loadout it's a little bit confusing or even sometimes the mouse click does not work anymore, so you have to close the thing and re-open it.Sometimes the animals will get stuck and will be an easy prey for you, or even dissapear (2 out of the 30 deers I've hunted so far had completely dissapeared, meaning that the tracks are entirely gone after a few miles of tracking, and it is kind of annoying)You will also have to invest many hours playing it, so if you are a busy person I recommend playing something less time demanding, since the game itself it is ment to be played slowly, no runnin n' gunnin' here mates.Now it has plenty of good things aswell...the atmosphere of the game its outstanding, the graphic its astounding, the lightning its well made, and the places are huges and not repetitive. You've got a story mode that kind of reminds me to ""Firewatch"", the voice acting it's really good, and if you are looking for a game to relax, give it a shot, it has been worth my time.Overall the game its pretty playable, and me being some kind of ""lone ranger"", I've enjoyed my time with it...I will come back later to make an update and answer questions of the people who are intending to buy it.Many thanks for reading and don't be afraid to ask.Peace!

												I'm only about two hours into the game, but initial impressions are very positive.  The Good:Graphics are lovely, foliage density, lighting, weather--it's all on point.  I have brought my binoculars up multiple times checking if that movement in the distance is an animal, only to find a blowing branch or moving shadows. This really added to the immersiveness for me.  Branches and grass bend as you stalk past.  Playing the game with maxed settings (albeit at 1080p) with a constant 65fps, optimization seems solid, CPU/GPU temps both stayed well within reason.  intel i5 3.4GHz / gtx 980Sound is on point as well, highly directional, underbrush crunches, animals chirp, hoot, hollar and otherwise immerse you in the living environment.Core gameplay is solid.  Tracking, stalking, and shooting make for a fun formula.  I like that the hunting help (glowing tracks, directional assistance) are customizable, letting you play at the level of attention-to-detail you desire.  There seem to be plenty of progression options: weapon choices, different scopes, lures, binoculars; as well as a leveling skill/perk system.  And yet, the starting rifle feels plenty suitable for the game i've encountered thus far, so I don't feel rushed to level or worry about that stuff yet.The Bad:As some of the other reviews mentioned, the menu controls are kinda strange at times.  Either they occasionally hang so that you can't back out entirely, or there is some element of the selection that is somewhat tricky/unclear.  It hasn't caused me any major setbacks as a combination of escape and selecting the settings menu has allowed me to resume each time.  There don't seem to be many 'visual' character customization options.  Character presets  are pretty limited as are outfits.  This doesn't matter to me right now, but may become more important when I try out the multiplayer gameplay options.The To Be Continued:Haven't tried the multiplayer.  As that is the primary reason I was anticipating this game, I will have to update once I've had a chance to do so.   "

												Here is my opinion, after the first 10+ hours of the game.There should be no doubt that this game has great potential but currently lacks due to some bugs. Unfortunately, it's not something smallish and not so important stuff. Let me give an example. I have during my first few hours in the game already encountered numerous bugs where the animals are stuck in trees and rocks and keep running like they were on ecstacy, it might be fun to look at but after some time, you just get really annoyed about it. They might be easy to shoot - but they kill the overall feeling about being on a ""real hunt"". Another major flaw is the lack of greater depth in the multiplayer session. If you or your partner is the host of the server you play on, then it would be impossible for the other part to get certain spots on the map. Which again, unfortunately, sucks big time because of the distance between areas and places like ""save zone/fast travel"". They really need some kind of vehicle to reduce the distance to certain areas like this. Otherwise i think a lot of people would get tired of just walking/running from the other end of the map to another. Also I would like to see some more challenges online, not just those few they have right now, but something which could be a lot more interesting to do. Graphic wise, I think it look's really good. And the sounds are not bad at all. Small adjustments here and there would make this part of the game to be some of the best with The Hunter: Call of the Wild. Is it worth buying now? It depends on whether you are willing to invest in a product that possibly should have waited 2-3 months longer to correct some crucial bugs as the game crashes from time to time. (Something the dev's are working on right now). Even though this review seems negative, I just can't get myself to press the ""negative"" button. I think if some of those things i have written is going to change, then this game can get really good over time! At least im exicited to see what the future brings, hopefully more animals, new areas, easier level system, and vehicles.			"

												This game is a big step up from the theHunter Classic. First off you only need to pay once for the game, no other fees. Graphics are amazing, lots of details with the grass, water, and other things. Sounds are pretty on point and the timing of where you are and the noise level are pretty amazing. You still have a hunter score or leveling system(whatever you call it).This game also has some bad traits but, nothing that should turn away a person from playing this amazing game. Optimizing needs some work. I have an ok gaming pc, for example I can play Gta 5 online on high settings and do about 60 - 80 fps. This game I can only run on low settings and get about 20 - 35 fps. Animals do get stuck sometimes like on rocks on the side of a hill which gives the player a huge chance at getting the animals. The good news is all the downsides are pretty simple changes if they decide to do them. Another con is that when you shoot the weapon with the scope on, it will glitch out and you will have to re-aim which means if you got a bad shot on the animal then your probly gonna be tracking it for a while unless your fast and re-aiming and shooting the target. I still recommend the game because the experience is like no other game out there. Animal movements are pretty realistic and cool to see in a game. For $30 I recommend this game and this game just released, so many changes are going to happen. Keep that in mind!			"

												The scenery in this game is stunning. For the most part (release version), the game works and runs very well, and it is a great hunting game. There a some bugs that probably should not have made it past the beta stage, and I am sure the developers will fix these if they want the game to succeed. The GUI is functional, but not the greatest.Is it a bad game? No at all; a lot of effort went in the environment.Is it a great game? Not yet. It certainly has the potential, but there are some mechanics that needs to be looked it.Is this game for everyone? Hunting games are not for everyone, but if that is your thing there is no harm in picking this one up. It offers a great experience out of the ""box"".For people that expect a flawless release in every game they buy, maybe hold off for a few weeks until the devs plug the bigger holes.			"

If you liked theHunter classic but did not want to pay for a membership, pick this game up it's only thirty USD. This game is beautiful and realistic.

tl;dr – if you like huntin' and/or huntin' games...buy it!!You know what? So far, I like this game! It seems to be the start of the hunting game I've always wanted. I've over the years played a few, and I liked ""theHunter: Classic"" too. However, I always felt that ""theHunter: Classic"" was too bloated & bogged down with micro-transactions to get any real enjoyment out of it. This one though, I think has a ton of potential and I'm looking forward to what ""Expansive Worlds"" has in store for it. As far as all the hate and negativity – I'm not sure why, nor do I care to debate it. I may be in a minority, but I've had no issues with the game whats-so-ever. I say that, though, having started playing it after the patches began rolling out. So maybe it was pretty bad during the launch, I don’t know. I just know I can currently run the game on one GTX 1080, with maxed out in-game settings, at around 50-75fps. Graphics wise – (to me & my ""seasoned"" eyes) the game looks pretty nice. Wonderful scenery and grand vistas abound – both of which, I feel, can be pretty awe inspiring. When looking at the world around you, from both ground level and from an observation tower; you get a sense of how big the world you’re in really is. Sound wise – the voice acting, the music, and sound effects has been done pretty well. The detailed sounds of the animal living life & their movements about, along with the enviromental effects such as; the rain, wind, cracking branches, and the crunch of the ground under foot all add to the sense of immersion and brings to life the feeling of truly being in the woods stalking / hunting my prey. While the game is nice, it’s not perfect. A few complaints worth mentioning are: (1) Optimization could be a little better, and on the graphics front – I would like to see SLI support added. (2) Scene coloring, as well as the overall “crispness” of the textures could be better – perhaps a few in-game adjustment sliders could help with this? (3) UI wonkiness...like not being able to exit the settings menu without going to the map?? (4) Game pad support, even keyboard control binding could definitely be improved upon. The lag between trying to rebind a key, and the time the game accepts is pretty strange. Usually you have no idea if you’re currently rebinding or not, because we are given no confirmation and/or feedback from this system. Controller wise, I was unable to you the controller exclusively without using the keyboard to bail me out…I’m looking at you menus! For most this won’t be an issue, as many will probably not dare use a controller, but some of us (with semi-worn out joints) find comfort in using the gamepad from time to time.This game and others like it won't be for everyone. Overall though, I would, and do recommend this game for purchase! However if you're not a fan of the genre, but find yourself curious – I would suggest a ""buy & try"" during a sale sometime. That being said...Happy Hunting!! "

Sometimes your game will crash, FPS drops aren't common but they happen, your mission progress will get stuck and force you to restart your save, scope glitches when you fire making it difficult to track a animal after you shot, animals will sometimes get stuck, and tracks can completetly disappear forcing you to restart the game. The game is a lot of fun and has a lot of potential. Most definitetly a step up from the previous game. Much more improved mechhanics and several new weapons as well. If you're able to withstand the crashes and bugs this game has then I would definitetly say buy it especially if you're a fan of the previous game. When the game works as intended it's a blast to play and I don't regret buying it at all. Hopefully the devs keep to this game and don't abandon it like they did with theHunter Primal.			"

												Game looks Great and Ive had a lot of fun so far. I like the progession where you get skill points and money to buy gear.Hate the hunter classic pay model and this is way better. They do need a rack/trophy system as it is now the racks seem to be all the same without any difference between animals or each side. Seems to me people arent giving it a chance.. low game time and then bad review. Try playing it for a while. It is not the same as the hunter classic but then again the hunter classic progressed over years so to expect this game to be the same is just not right. The new engine is WAY better then classic. You can spot animals further out and tracking is good. I like how the grass lays down where you and the animals walk and the wind and weather is cool. If you played the classic and liked spotting animals in the wide open grass field because the engine couldnt hadle it and then walk up and kill everything without a challenge then go pay to play classic. I find this one so much more realistic. harder to spot animals and they spook at a further range making you actually stalk and come up with  a plan. You have to look at your surroundings and realize the area your in may not be a good spot due to limited view or bushes. not everywhere is a good spot like classic. JMO If you have a decent computer then its good. Ive had a couple of crashes on start up but never in game.			"

												I love this game played a few hours now all these bugs everyone is expiriencing i havn't had one. I dont know if this is caused by worse computers i have a really good cpu and gpu so that might be why im not having any bugs or crashes. its hard enough to be relistic but just easy enough to be fun. everyone is judging this game to harshly it just came out they havnt played much, you get what says it will give you an accurate hunting simulator.

												Yes it has bugs - yes it could've been better optimized.I've played The Hunter Classic, and the issues were the same.I really don't put much efford into judging this game in a negative way, cause I can't stop enjoying the gameplay.A very good hunter simulator, which can be played in a casual way - Which is just what I needed!Excellent graphics and the sound and atmosphere just grab me into continue playing.

												I'm only about two hours into the game, but initial impressions are very positive.  The Good:Graphics are lovely, foliage density, lighting, weather--it's all on point.  I have brought my binoculars up multiple times checking if that movement in the distance is an animal, only to find a blowing branch or moving shadows. This really added to the immersiveness for me.  Branches and grass bend as you stalk past.  Playing the game with maxed settings (albeit at 1080p) with a constant 65fps, optimization seems solid, CPU/GPU temps both stayed well within reason.  intel i5 3.4GHz / gtx 980Sound is on point as well, highly directional, underbrush crunches, animals chirp, hoot, hollar and otherwise immerse you in the living environment.Core gameplay is solid.  Tracking, stalking, and shooting make for a fun formula.  I like that the hunting help (glowing tracks, directional assistance) are customizable, letting you play at the level of attention-to-detail you desire.  There seem to be plenty of progression options: weapon choices, different scopes, lures, binoculars; as well as a leveling skill/perk system.  And yet, the starting rifle feels plenty suitable for the game i've encountered thus far, so I don't feel rushed to level or worry about that stuff yet.The Bad:As some of the other reviews mentioned, the menu controls are kinda strange at times.  Either they occasionally hang so that you can't back out entirely, or there is some element of the selection that is somewhat tricky/unclear.  It hasn't caused me any major setbacks as a combination of escape and selecting the settings menu has allowed me to resume each time.  There don't seem to be many 'visual' character customization options.  Character presets  are pretty limited as are outfits.  This doesn't matter to me right now, but may become more important when I try out the multiplayer gameplay options.The To Be Continued:Haven't tried the multiplayer.  As that is the primary reason I was anticipating this game, I will have to update once I've had a chance to do so.   "

												Here is my opinion, after the first 10+ hours of the game.There should be no doubt that this game has great potential but currently lacks due to some bugs. Unfortunately, it's not something smallish and not so important stuff. Let me give an example. I have during my first few hours in the game already encountered numerous bugs where the animals are stuck in trees and rocks and keep running like they were on ecstacy, it might be fun to look at but after some time, you just get really annoyed about it. They might be easy to shoot - but they kill the overall feeling about being on a ""real hunt"". Another major flaw is the lack of greater depth in the multiplayer session. If you or your partner is the host of the server you play on, then it would be impossible for the other part to get certain spots on the map. Which again, unfortunately, sucks big time because of the distance between areas and places like ""save zone/fast travel"". They really need some kind of vehicle to reduce the distance to certain areas like this. Otherwise i think a lot of people would get tired of just walking/running from the other end of the map to another. Also I would like to see some more challenges online, not just those few they have right now, but something which could be a lot more interesting to do. Graphic wise, I think it look's really good. And the sounds are not bad at all. Small adjustments here and there would make this part of the game to be some of the best with The Hunter: Call of the Wild. Is it worth buying now? It depends on whether you are willing to invest in a product that possibly should have waited 2-3 months longer to correct some crucial bugs as the game crashes from time to time. (Something the dev's are working on right now). Even though this review seems negative, I just can't get myself to press the ""negative"" button. I think if some of those things i have written is going to change, then this game can get really good over time! At least im exicited to see what the future brings, hopefully more animals, new areas, easier level system, and vehicles.			"

Their's alot that still needs to be done as their are still bugs with animal trackings and movements. When these are fixed then they can acctually introduce real content to this game so that it can meet its potential.			"

												I just wanted to write this quick review - I'm a slightly older gamer than average I guess, so tend not to buy new Games the moment they appear (i.e. I'm a skinflint and remember when Games were £5 new!)...anyway was convinced to buy this as I do a bit of hunting in real life.And WOW am I impressed - stunning graphics ( I play at 4k on a 55inch OLED and it's Fricking beautiful!)Gameplay is good,Animal AI seem pretty good, I've not seen ANY of the many bugs that people have reported from earlier versions.Weapons handling seems very realistic - two small improvements could be the ability to rest the weapon, i.e. stabilise it on a Tree or Rock or whatever with a bipod etc... And the fatigue that should set in for holding a weapon on aim over time... But apart from that, spot on.I've literally spent the last weekend ""Away on a Hunting trip"" and am embarressed to admit I cancelled a REAL shooting morning with my buddies on Sunday to play this.... sad eh !?Anyway if you're slightly interested in sneaking around in the bushes and a game that has a slower more organic pace, then I would recommend this one to you..Worth every penny !SJ "

												I was super pumped to play this game, but....When I launched it I knew something was off.  The game seemed fine and had a decent frame rate on high settings.  I started to play and could barely move.  The game was running well, but the character would not move fast.  All the animals were moving at normal speed as well, making tracking and finding animals nearly impossible.  Because the game involves so much travel, I decided to ask for a refund because my character moved to slowly to properly enjoy the game.I have checked online, and this appears to be a common problem.Also, I watched many youtubers play the game before deciding to buy.  They moved MUCH faster and the game looked like tons of fun.If the devs can fix this problem, I would happily play it again.  The hunting itself was great, but after this glitch gets fixed, it could easily be a 4 star game.			"

												This game certainly has some strong qualities. Great graphics. Excellent lighting effects, weather effects etc.Really large map. Nice weapons and accessories.Tracking system is not overcomplicated.But it also has some weak qualities. No vehicles on a ridiculously large map. You have to walk everywhere. All of the time. It's so boring sometimes when you just want to go from point A to point B.The level progression is insanely slow, to the point where it can take days to get a new weapon. No way to pause the game, literally, none. You can't rest without paying the money you earned from hunting. That's the dumbest thing I've ever seen in a video game. In the current state I do not recommend this game. It is good for just relaxing instead of going fast paced like in most games, but other than that it needs some serious improvements in those areas.EDIT: Still giving it a go. I just went up a tower to survey the land, with the intent on finding the nearest hunting camp afterwards. Fell off the tower, now I have to walk nearly 2KM to get to the new camp. All because there are nowhere near enough fast travel points. This is the main problem with this game. I hope things get better because once a few of these issues are fixed this could be one of the best games ever.			"

												So add my review onto the pile of negatives. I see most of the positive reviews seem to be in direct response to the negative reviews and the which weigh in heavily on the Buggyness of the game in its released state. And most of those positive reviews are basing their positivity on the assumption that all bugs present will be fixed. I can say for sure that this is usually not the case, especially for a game released in full. They already have peoples money, they cashed in on the product. so even if they did want to polish it. They have little tangiable return guarantee to do so. Everyone should review a game (especially a full release) in its current state, not for what is planned or what could possibly be fixed later, because those are NEVER guarantees.This is my first hunting game, I played a couple hours of thehunter: classic as soon as I got to the microtransaction part (I like to play games, not money syphoning tubes). The first 6 hours of playing this game was fantastic. I completely forgot I was in my room on a computer. 100% immersion. Then, I found a bear. Bears are completely unfunctional. its as if they put the bear model, its sounds and 2 animations into the game a week before release. Half of the pause menu doesnt work with keyboard controls or any of the button prompts displayed on the bottom of the menu, This is something you fix in the first few weeks of development. I returned today into my game to do more hunting and found that none of the tracking indicators were workint, not even the direction cone when you identify a track. I had messed around with the tracking settings in my previous play session but that was to turn them back on. Sure enough, they were all on. I switched them of and on and this changed nothing, I restart my computer and this changed nothing. so one of the core mechanics of the gameplay is now bugged and my next step is to validate my game files which I will update when I do. This game is beautiful and runs well on my computer (gtx 1080 I7 6700)For those who want a good disconnect from life and a trip through the wilderness, $30 is quite modest. But expect to encounter sub alpha levels of bug fodder. And for a dev team who has a history in this genre, Its a bit sad to see.			"

												For the few hours I have played CotW I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a hunting game and doesn't want to pay extra for Classic.For people new to the franchise, I would start with CotW. It is the cheaper alternative and delivers for its price range. While Classic may have more animals, gameplay and community features CotW is a more inclusive system. Not nessecarily easier as it comes with its own challenges but the learning curve is more user-friendly.For people returning from previous theHunter games I believe it would depend on what you want. In a way, CotW is closer to Primal than Classic. There are fewer animals, less trophy diversity and fewer game mechanics but the AI is more advanced and the species don't feel like the same system tacked onto multiple different models.As for bugs I have only experienced one major one that simply required a game restart. There are several smaller ones that are more annoyances than game breaking, which I am sure will be patched out in the following weeks.As for the things I don't like, coming from Classic was a bit of a shock and while I know some people would be upset for the change, EW was very upfront that CotW would not be what Classic is. It was sold as a game that would not compete with Classic and some people seem to have forgotten that, or never understood what that ment. After a few hours of playing I grew to enjoy what CotW offers at this moment in time, however, it does feel rather empty. Such large maps with so little diversity.Despite this, I do think this game is worth buying. Be it now, or in a few months. If you are worried about bugs and missing features I would wait but definitely come back every once in awhile to see how the game progresses.Good luck and happy hunting!			"

												Coming from somebody who plays a lot of open world video games, and has spent many hours in the wilderness, this game is super A+ #1 awesome.Honestly, a few bugs and glitches here and there, but nothing game breaking and honestly is barely took away from my overall experience. This is a game I will play for hours on end and not even know time is passing.Pros: -amazing environmental graphics and sounds (Trees/overall fauna is unbelievable)- Animal AI (needs just a little tuning but otherwise captivating)- Weapon physics/bullet penetration/animal penetration- Choice in weapons/ammo- Map size and scale, super realistic- Story mode and quests!!- Real sense of progression with skill and perk leveling systemsThings they need to improve:-Effectiveness of calls/scents are too high, they don't work that well in real life-Animal pathfinding/sticking on objects-UI needs to be smoother in the shop-Needs a buck point system-Prone positioning while on uneven terrain is super clippy. All in all, they can have this game vastly improved and damn near perfect with a few key patches. I recommend getting the game NOW, because it's very playable and immersive even with these minor issues, and by the time they have the game perfect you can have a leveled up character ;-)			"

												Keep in mind i really enjoy this game. But i'll say you shouldn't buy it due to the current state it is in. (not everyone can accept some of the game breaking bugs)Graphics and atomosphere are top notch in the game. You can easily get immersed due to the great sounds,lighting,and overall graphicsThe gameplay itself is pretty straight forward, you have a quest or two you can do if you want but overall you're just hunting which is great.Multiplayer is a mess, if the animals are not teleporting everywhere or invulnerable, they are running into trees and rocks and getting stuck ruining the fun of hunting. Many times you cant even harvest the animals you've killed.There are many gamebreaking bugs at the moment which leave me dumbfounded. Some of these bugs that i encounter all the time are        - Rifle scopes not working if you also have used a bow        - Waypoints have either not worked at all or will show you two places at once on your UI/HUD (lots of times both of them aren't even the spots you picked), also you can't delete them so you have to reload to get rid of them        - Tracking is pretty broken in many ways (leading you the wrong way, sometimes in a circle)        - Hit reg is really janky since the new update (double lung shots sometimes give minor wounds? wtf)        - Multiplayer is a mess Overall i love the game but I will never tell anyone to buy it due to the state the game was released in (patches have made it worse so far) "

												So with a lot of negative reviews I thought Id give my input on theHunter: CotW.Pros:Graphics are absolutely amazing.Realistc gameplayFun and chill game solo or with friendsAwesome hunting simWorth the priceCons:A few bugs (nothing gamebreaking)The menu's could be a bit betterConlusion:Game is worth the price and it's definitely fun, I picked the game up and played 7 hrs in one sitting and had a blast.  In the 7 hrs I experienced 0 crashes and 2 bugs (one being a bear stuck on a rock, and the other I wasnt able to loot a boar after I killed it.) I recommend this game, it will only get better with updates.			"

												hello random people of the world!i just bought this game yesterday, i have played for two (maybe a little over two) hours.. and it is HELLA fun, i sat with a friend and walked around trying to kill everything.the graphics are beautiful, it runs fantastic.. though i have a beast of a pc and it can run anything i throw at it.. so... for people complaining the game is super laggy, doesn't run well, and just giving it negative comments because your pc isn't the greatest, stop, sure, it doesn't run well on YOUR pc.. but everyone else doesn't have YOUR pc.have a good pc, this wont be an issue.the hunting/tracking is a lot of fun, very realistic. i love this game already, though i've always been a hunting game lover!it takes a lot of patience, so if you can't stand slow moving REALISTIC hunting, then move on.. this game will not be for you. i however, find it great.i have no come across any bugs at all, besides maybe one black bear who was ""stuck"" on pretty much nothing and running in place.. though that fixed itself in less than 5 seconds and he continued to run away..BY THE WAY, what damn black bear would rather run from me than attack me?! even coyote? no way in hell those would run from me.. come on now lolanyway, fantastic, beautiful game.. i can't wait to keep playing it. hella fun!

												Like alot of people have stated this game is pretty much a beta. there are alot of problems that need to be addressed. i was hoping for a no micro transaction version of the classic hunter but all that has improved from the classic is the graphics. there is a lack of variety in the guns and you have to put in a crazy ammount of hours to unlock any. the missions are in no way progressive and it doesnt seem like alot of thought has been put into them which is annoying since there doesnt seem to be a trophy system. you can just shoot anyhting around to get money and xp leaving you with no real want to pick your targets carefully. there are shotguns with birdshot but nothing to shoot them with.either way ive enjoyed playing it to a point but with bugs and what not ive been really put off playing for now			"

												For the few hours I have played CotW I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a hunting game and doesn't want to pay extra for Classic.For people new to the franchise, I would start with CotW. It is the cheaper alternative and delivers for its price range. While Classic may have more animals, gameplay and community features CotW is a more inclusive system. Not nessecarily easier as it comes with its own challenges but the learning curve is more user-friendly.For people returning from previous theHunter games I believe it would depend on what you want. In a way, CotW is closer to Primal than Classic. There are fewer animals, less trophy diversity and fewer game mechanics but the AI is more advanced and the species don't feel like the same system tacked onto multiple different models.As for bugs I have only experienced one major one that simply required a game restart. There are several smaller ones that are more annoyances than game breaking, which I am sure will be patched out in the following weeks.As for the things I don't like, coming from Classic was a bit of a shock and while I know some people would be upset for the change, EW was very upfront that CotW would not be what Classic is. It was sold as a game that would not compete with Classic and some people seem to have forgotten that, or never understood what that ment. After a few hours of playing I grew to enjoy what CotW offers at this moment in time, however, it does feel rather empty. Such large maps with so little diversity.Despite this, I do think this game is worth buying. Be it now, or in a few months. If you are worried about bugs and missing features I would wait but definitely come back every once in awhile to see how the game progresses.Good luck and happy hunting!			"

												This review is written on 4.5 hours of playtime:To start, I love this game. Everyone's biggest issue with theHunter classic was that you had to pay (real money) for weapons and items. In CotW, you earn money to buy them by completing missions and harvesting animals. I love using the camera to take photos of an absolutely stunning visual experience.However, there are a lot of bugs, almost too many to mention and probably some that have not even been noticed yet. This is not acceptable for a full release game, if there is such a term anymore. It's 2017, developers dish out patches left and right to make thier games better, and I have a hard time believing Expansive Worlds will just up and give up on this game that they have been so passionate about.Verdict: If you want a hunting game, and hate microtransactions, this is the game for you. Otherwise, stick to the 'free' theHunter : Classic version for now. P.S. EW has voiced that both versions of theHunter will be living on, and that they are to go hand-in-hand.-Review will be tweaked as play time and patches go on-			"

												Really good game WITHOUT micro transaction or PAY to hunt everything.ALSO there are as far as i notised no serious bugs or problems, and the game do not feel unfinished or like a Beta like many ""unserious reviews claim"".I think that many of the reviews sound kind of fake and are negative on purpose.( im so glad they desided to release ""the hunter"" game with one payment only, since the pay for this and that scared med away from the previous title ""the hunter"".ANyway im not expert in the past game the hunter, and i only played the new ""call of the wild"" for 2 houres.But so far i enjoy it and the changes.The game world is beautifull and there are many cool features such as the plants moving when a small animal sneak arround.The sound is really amazing and create a good atmosphere and will make you feel releaxed.THe game have a career/skill/perk system wich will allow you to upgrade different things over time such as tracking animals and shooting ect.I think this is nice, since you start as a rookie hunter and become better and better.I am not aware if you can start as a ""pro"" hunter with all perks and all guns as a kind of free world go hunting kind of thing, but the career thing i like so for me no issue.When it come to animals you can hunt there are like 8-10 big animals such as ""black bear, red tail, mose, fox, wild boar and other animals. And you dont have to pay to hunt them :-)Everytime you hunt down an animal you get awarded xp and money.The ingame money you earn can be used to buy new weapons, bullets and sometimes you even come across small buildings you can buy and use for hunting.The tracking of animals is like in the hunter, but i think it is a little more easy to see the tracks now.I think you can be hardcore and adjust the kind of help you like and how visual things will be.You can either go hunting on your own or with friends, and you also get  missions you can do, example hunt an animal and make a photo of it ( press p ).It effect the game how much you hunt in an area, and you can view this on your map as a purple colour, so try to not shoot everything you see, and do some different hunts all over the map.So far the only bug i found during 2 hour gameplay is that i fall down a mountain, and 5 minutes later I could not use any of my gear. But other than that, no big bugs that i notised.It run very good and smooth though the game world is huge and very detailed.Can i recommend this game.. YES i think it is really good, and I hope that they release some cheap dlc's in the future so people who like more animals or gear can buy example an weapon pack or animal pack.Ps. if you buy and do not like the game, then you can ask for a refund if you use the steam support system and play less than 2 houres.. So what do you have  to loose by giving it a try ;-)			"

This game is a Hunter Simulator set in european deciduous forests, made by Expansive Worlds, a quite experienced hunter-sim developer underpined by Avalanche Studios and their really astonishing APEX Engine. Multiplayer included.  Aspect Annotation   Graphics, Atmosphere and Scenery:
☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺OO 
 The new APEX engine is definetely meritorious, it offers some great visual feedback for the player: Wind Simulation, Falling Leaves, Curving Grass and Decent Texture&Draw Distance. Eveverything in the games looks real enough for the player to relish it.   Gameplay:
☺☺☺☺☺☺OOOO It's kinda meh. The whole gameplay spins around following the trails of animals and then shooting them dead with deficient variativity. It's a notably protracted and tedious process, especially in late game. The Character is also really flaccid, and there are no vehicles in this game, and that convicts the player to spend half of his time walking from point A to point B on a really big map with the lack of fast travel spots. Multiplayer mode makes it much pleasant and fun though, but it still won't last for long.   Stability and Online:
☺☺☺☺☺OOOOO It's really poor. There are lots of gamebreaking bugs and gliches from disappearing corpses to critical error crashes. Same applies to the multiplayer, where crashes and disconnects are a comming thing  Overall: 7.1/10 While TheHunter:CotW ensures some fascinating immersion and visual fidelity, the amount of systematic problems and a considerably wearisome gameplay mechanics might dramatically spoil the impression of the game "

												Ok not going to rehash all the other great reviews out there already but as of this time I have 82 hours in it and i havent even made it to the second reserve . I dont know how some of you justify bang for the buck but with that much game play in half the game its pretty hard to ♥♥♥♥♥ even with the glitches which are certainly better than when released and being worked on all the time. If you like hunting games bingo its a winner if you like walking simulators also spot on. The rare few who actually like both its about as good as it gets in that sense ,plus a level grind aspect that keeps me playing with a goal to achieve . The glitches mentioned before while annoying are not game breaking the disappearing tracks issue is the hardest to deal with but also getting better (my suggestion is to be dam sure before you let that arrow or bullet fly). I like many others have literaly spent hours tracking a less that stellar shot to make sure i keep my consecutive harvest bonus going and it just seems wrong even in the game world to just take pot shots at everything then let them die slowly out in the brush to rot. I find if i just pick an undiscovered spot on the map and walk ( not run sometimes even in stealth which seems agonozingly slow) there I will several chances to track seomthing or even straight out walk up on a clean shot situation.I dont find the hunting blinds all that helpful but they do work you just have to use the calls but it seems boring when there is plenty to hunt walking around. Running is only a means to get from point a to b not a method to travel and expect to hun. The wildlife will hear you before you even get a warning call from them and its like your on a deserted planet. If your a twitch pvp gotta shoot a hundered rounds an hour player keep walking this isnt your game. There is however plenty of beautiful scenery and simply walking to open up map areas is enjoyable if you have a 5.1 or better headset or surround system crank it up and head into the woods listen for warning and mating calls and stealth towards them its very cool. Keep in mind which way your scent is going as it will tip them off before anything else does many times. I love the direction this game is going and cant wait to visit the other reserve looking forward to some new reserve dlcs maybe a few more things to hunt would rock but still pretty darn good now. I would like the option to start a second data or more so as i go to a new reserve i can start from scratch while still having the option to bring my developed character to look for bigger game as well . I love the level asect of it for me i like to have a goal to work towards there is a good mix of xp grind and  money grind here to keep you motiviated. They cant give it all to you for free at the start or you'd get bored quickly. I do feel like having to start over from scratch on the consecutive harvest thing is a bit of a pain but not horrible. I mostly find it makes it impossible to jump in and play for short bursts because so much of the game requires you to get gold kills and that is ony going to happen if you have 100% modifier on consecutive harvest as well as quick kill and it needs to be basically mythical grade animal.Graphics are really nice sometimes i just climb a mountain to see the view from up there some of the waters edge shots you get as well looking out over a tranquil mountiain lake or river is beautiful. Dont judge it by all the negative reviews while the points are valid a lot of times, many have been addressed and i have found none game breaking aggravating at times yes but not gamebreaking. I have only had one or two animals that i got any sort of decent shot into that didnt result in a successful harvest with diligent tracking and patience.Almost forgot dont forget to try the bow I started this game thinking good lord I'll never get close enough to anything to kill it with a bow but you will and its a real sense of accomplishment when you take down a mythical level red deer lets say with your bow very cool. I hunt almost exclusively with it now but still break out the 270 as well ,sometimes you just want to make sure especially if your on a mission and have 100% harvest bonus and dont want to risk it.There it is all i can think of hope it helps i enjoyed this game enough that i didnt even mind buying it full price 30 bucks is not outrageous . I looked at the classic version and I would never enjoy it as much as this one even with the larger number of things to hunt micro transaction games just leave me with a bad vibe and the days of monthy subscription games are pretty much done. Thnx hopefully this isnt too gramaticaly borked a nice spell checker gramar checker would be handy here lol.  "

												I would like to start of by mentioning that this game looks beautiful, the sounds and feeling from the elements while going around tracking down game is something I have not seen in another game atleast not at this caliber. I'd love to give a really positive review, but sadly there are too many gamebreakers at the moment to try getting strangers of me to buy this game, unless you don't mind overlooking them.The first bug I encountered was the animals getting stuck between bushes and rocks, this one I noticed on my third kill of the game as a poor deer was running and running between a rock and a tree. After my current hours in the game I have seen this tens of times allready, but I wouldent call it gamebreaking, but it's a minus.In real hunting you rarly go for multiple shots towards diffrent games, but if you do in this game it seems like the tracking gets thrown of abit. Vital/flesh wounds on 'non' rare game not showing up & neither are tracks. A couple of times all tracks just disappeared all together and the only way I found to fix it was to reset the game, wich is a blunder when you are far of a outpost hunting(as in you only spawn in around the nearest outpost).The mission system is a good adition, but some of the missions are abit random to complete and some are better of leaving undone til you can afford and/or able to buy better equipment(ex. pictures of several animals of same race in a set zone). Some quests seems bugged, as they would not complete even if conditions are met(ex. killing deer at night).What I do like is how much of a grind it is to max your hunting skills and perks you can pick up.The real gamebreaker for me is the random and unexpected crashes, screen freezes with looping sound. Giving it a quick search just shows how many are affected by this and there has not been a single respons from the game developers about this yet. They seem to happen more and more depending on how much of a map you have explored, as I can play one of the zones without a crash for longer then the more explored zone(but what do I know). So for me when I am in the zone, focused to bring down game, take a shot and trying to track down the giant moose to see how big it actually was. And for it all to be a waste of time by a frozen screen and looping sound, meh I got better things to do then playing a non-finished game.My review of this game were from the last week intil today, 10/3-17. I might change my mind about this if there is a game fixing patch coming, but I would advice to wait to pick this up to see if they manage to change this visual pearl to a hour sandbox.			"

												First off i love hunting and do it alot. But this isnt hunting. this is a walker simulator with a gun in your hands, thats just it. Most of the time the animals dont even respond to your calls so you gotta go finding them, but their AI is so bugged they might run away while your a mile and a half away. The amount of glitches and bugs, this game should NOT have been realeased like this. they might as well have sold us an IOU note. The menus are janky and unstable, the AI is just bad, the guns break all the time, and the framerate is in the low 20 at medium. {Also an important note thats affecting me personally, The Discussion mods keep shutting me down for the stupidest things, like actually banning me for a question about a game mechanic i didnt understand. I asked in discussions about Zero Distance and what that is, and my post was deleted about 20 minutes after, than when i called them out on it they banned me for ""Causing a Ruckus""}All in all this whole thing is a pile of junk and i doubt it will ever get fixed properly. DONT BUY IT!			"

												This game has potential, but typical of an Expensive Worlds release, it's chock full of bugs. The hit detection is just awful.  Shots that would be kill shots in real life are flesh wounds in this game.  What is really frustrating is the misleading ""free gun and gillie suit"" promotion.  If you have both theHunter classic and theHunter: Call of the Wild, you don't get the gun and gillie suit for free, you get the opportunity to buy them.  Yes, you buy them with in-game money, but it takes a long time to earn enough to buy them.  As of right now, I can't recommend this game, and I wish I wouldn't have bought it.  Maybe after a few patches, and some more patches to kill the bugs they introduce with those patches, it will be playable, but right now, I'd stay away.			"

Price is bit much for an unfinished game. If you thuroughly enjoy hunting IRL, you might enjoy more than me.BEST PART:I saw in the distance, down a mountain, a beautiful Whitetail Deer. Bushes rustling near it, with a little bunny standing still. I crouched, waiting for the perfect shot. I get a spine shot, instantly if fell over, and the bunny somehow managed to die. I was excited, so I walked 5 feet foward to get a better view to remember their location. I fell down the mountain. I was going really fast. So fast the ground couldn't handle my body. I went through the ground at Mach speed.5/7 would mach speed the ground again.			"

												Pros:-Looks good-Sounds good-Feels goodCons:-Buggy-Unpolished-Very arcadey features that can't be ignored or turned off such as perks, skills, XP, some infuriating woman talking to you, weapon 'stats', icons everywhere, information like a health bar, and a sound meter on the screen not even on the hunter mate, compass is again on the screen when it should be on the huntermateWait until it's fixed, in its current state it is basically beta.I'm unhappy about the arcadey stuff. I knew they were going to make it more 'accesible' which is never a good thing with games, but hoped all the rubbish like XP and perks would be optional, so far some of the visual clues can be turned off, as well as the annoying missions and tutorial, but you can't get around the XP and perks.I would love the devs to have two modes. One game like mode like it is now, and another simulation mode like the Classic Hunter.Honestly if this is the beginning of the end for this game then it will be a shame because the engine seems great and the environments look stunning, it has just been rushed and they're trying to casualise it to get new players. I know I have a low amount of hours in the game for now but I've played enough of the hunter 'classic' to judge it so far.Wait until the game is fixed and polished, hopefully the developers will sort the bugs out and listen to the community.Update 19/3/17: I'm glad the devs are working on the bugs and releasing patches but the game still feels very unfinished, I would wait still.

												theHunter: Call of the Wild,I'd give her 5 stars. Not entirely sure what all the hate and absolute disgust is all about, I have found nothing but greatness in the product.Yes, sure there are a few issues here and there, but nothing that patches won't be able to iron out. Right, just a brief reason why I rate COTW so highly with a pro's and con's list below.Call of the Wild has some of the most beautiful, calming and pleasuring forests, plains, rivers and mountains to explore, the ambiance the game creates in that regard is utter beauty.The animals themselves are really great to look at and stalk. Sure the Buck do not have the hugest varity of Antlers out there, but i am curious to see what the future holds in that regard. Thus far each hunt has been majestic in its own way. Each hunt has brought about its own challenges and adventure with it. From hunting Red Fox to Various types of Deers, some animals are in a herd which force me to choose wisely and play my tactics carefully if i wish to leave with the best scoring animal, those that travel alone are often very sneaky and sometimes downright genius, though with enough patience and technique, the hunt will reward you with the sight of beauty and the pleasure of the one shot kill. (To which I have noticed a lot of people complaining about 3 shots to bring down a buck.... I have yet to have such an issue. 12 shots fired. 12 hits, 12 kills.Anyhow onto the Pro's and Con's list.Con's:1) Small game and Big game create the same noise while passing through foilage/bushes which is hugely missleading or should i say somewhat confusing, I have caught myself doing 360s with the rifle aimed, looking for that deer that made that racket while passing through the bushes, to see only later that it was merely a rabbit. Very odd for a Rabbit to make such a loud crash through the bushes.2) A couple of glitches while in Map mode, You have to constantly zoom in and out to see the borders of various places on the map, which isnt very helpful while trying to complete missions, but by no means a game breaker.3) A few animals are still getting glitched/stuck on various rocks and or tree trunks, Thus far has only happend twice out of the 12 animals i have had the opportunity of taking down.That is really it thus far.Pros:1) The beautifully designed Forests, Plains, Rivers, Mountains etc etc are a sight for sore eyes. I have no issues getting lost in them and just strolling through watching gazing Buck stroll through the wild. 2) The ambiance in the wild is fantastic, it really makes you feel as if you are in the wild, from the birds chirping, to the foxes howling (Squeeking?) to the birds flying out of the bushes while you hastly run past. The wind that blows over the plains and the odd time Thunder strikes the silent evening sky behind you. Its brilliantly done.3) The Animals are very goodlooking, From the Rabbit through to the various Deers (I have yet to find myself a Bear or any other larger Game, thus i have to hold that comment). They act very well, and I have yet to have issues with them spooking just to stop a few meters later. When they spook, my god do they run, and stop very very far away. Have had some fantastic 2 hour marches following those Tracks.4) The whole feeling to the game is great, It is not elite hardcore, but is by no means like a Call of Duty Hunter. I see tons of complaints that the game is far too arcade like, but I cannot seem to grasp what that means. The hunts are by no means easy, You can spend a very long time tracking down your prey, very easily spook him off and very easily miss your shot. (Unless ofcourse you are using your rifle like its a machine gun and shooting every animal in sight... well then you have no idea what hunting is about).Thats about it for now, I will ofcourse update the review at a later stage.All in all,I will be spending tons of hours on this beaut of a game.

												Welcome to beta testing 2.0/early access!!! (since we forgot to say that the first beta was just a joke and nothing was used from it!)This review will be changed when the game is patch to a playable state!!!!After playing the game for a fair amount of time i have had plenty of bugs and gliches.Con:- Crashing because who F***ing knows?!- ALT+TAB crashes.- Not able to claim trophys.- Not gaining money or xp from claiming trophys.- ""Spawning"" outside the map while still standing on campsites.- Tracks failing to appear.- Animal stuck on/in rocks/trees.- Scope not working on rifles when a weapon without scope is in your inventory.- Frame drops for no appearent reason.- Unable to claim an outpost in a multiplayer game (this fact is destroying my wish to play with friends since we can not all claim the same outpost only the host of the game can!)- No xp bar so its hard to know when you are going to level up next.- Falling to your death from a tiny rock.Pros:- The setting of the game is amazing! (PRAY TO RNGSUS everytime you bootup!!!)- Leveling isnt a must to kill pretty much anything in the game, a well placed shot or shots will do the trick.- Fantastic looking game.My pc should not have any trouble running this game on ultra. My pc specc:- MSI GTX 980 Ti- Ram DDR4 16GB 3000MHz- SSD 500GB 850 EVO- Intel i7-5930K- CPU cooler			"

												Week 3-4 update:  Looking like devs are making progress but the title still isnt fully polished.The game does run on some older machines but dont expect the world.  If you have crashes, its possible others are experiencing the same.  Devs had made it clear that if you document your bugs clearly & accurately, they will respond in return.   That may not mean your bug is fixed today, but you wont be ignored.I cant yet give this title a thumbs up, because there are still a number of bugs to be worked out.  Im hopeful, but not in a hurried kind of way.  In a couple of months, when its ready, the environments in this game will blow you away.------------------Weekend 1 review -- not reccomended.  Codebase appears incomplete and untested.  This is effectively a pay-to-play beta release, and it is quite broken.I suspect only the most elite high-end systems were tested in the undoubtedly brief QA cycle, and anyone using even remotely old hardware will be out of luck until many bugs are ironed out.For me, I have 2 systems that ran the orginal ""theHunter"" flawlessly at max settings, and i had hoped that with the same hareware at modest settings i'd be able to evaluate this new release.   But so far its no deal.  with my i7 2600k + gtx 570 the 3d engine will render 1-2 frames before it crashes. Pretty much crashes immediately after the logo screens.  Same exact result for my mobile i7+675gtx.This game obviously has promise and I'll be happy to give it a good reivew once its actually finished.  But for now, they appear to be funding their development cycle with pay to play beta shenanigans.Buyer Beware.			"

theHunter: Call of The Wild has the potential to be the best hunting game out there. It's a great foundation for the perfect hunting game. Unfortunately, that's all the game is at its current state. It's pretty much just a pretty landscape with everything else feeling rushed. When it actually works and you don't encounter one of the many bugs it's a really enjoyable and relaxing experience, but way too often do you find your immersion getting completely ruined by a visual bug or weird AI.Not only that, I feel like it lacks some critical content that you kind of expect from any hunting game. Here are two of the major things I think the game is lacking at the moment, to at least make it a complete hunting game and putting the glitches aside:1. Birds. You can hear them all around you. There are some oddly placed seagulls (or whatever they are) here and there that flies away by the noise you make. But there are no birds to hunt. I was really expecting this to be in the game at release, but knowing where the developers are coming from (the microtransaction hell that is theHunter: Classic) I'm guessing it will be a future DLC. Hard to say if the developers ran out of time or if this is an intentional decision. The shotguns are there to tease you though.2. Any means of transportation. The map is HUGE. It needs some kind of vehicles. And at the pace the character is running it feels even bigger. Sure, you can fast travel between the outposts but first you'll have to find them, usually by going to a lookout point to reveal them on the map and then walk to them to claim them and just hope that you don't accidentally stumble between two static rocks that somehow magically squishes you to death on your way there. Yes, that happened not only once, but three times. I remember playing Deer Hunter 3 back in the days and thought it was cool that you could get around with ATV's, snowmobiles and such. Guess this might be DLC too, concidering there are achievements for traveling ""BY FOOT"". Feels weird to state that unless they have some other way of travelling planned.Now those are just the features I feel that the game is currently lacking. As an addition to that it's riddled with bugs and some of the most horrible AI/pathfinding I've seen in a game. Which is a good way to completely ruin your immersion that you otherwise get from the stunning visuals. Squirrels gets stuck humping rocks, rabbits run in circles at the speed of light, deer gets stuck against trees and rocks and I've even seen a group of four different animal types running into eachother in a mess that looked like the queue line to the Noah's ark. I try my best to just ignore these derpy animals and move on but you see them way too often to just simply ignore them. I know it must be hard to code AI and especially animal like behaviour but I still don't expect to see these kind of situations in a full release of a hunting game. I've seen a whole pack of wild boars just running into an invisible wall forever. There doesn't seem to be any fall damage in the game, yet somehow you sometimes die if you get stuck between two rocks or try to climb them as I mentioned earlier. I even just flat out died walking on a flat surface at one point. The screen has gone completely blurry as if the field of depth was bugged and also completely red after I died once. These were fixed by just clicking ESC twice to bring up the menu interface (which can be a little bit disorienting at times when it comes to equipment and such) and then close it again. The smartphone is visible in some of the cutscenes, just floating there (sometimes upside down). I've found a hunting stand that was not buildable for whatever reason (surely the developers must have had time to test this once they put it down on the map?) and seen some weirdly placed street signs and poles. There was also this one pile of stones which gives you lore that had the trigger 8 meters underground so it was impossible to activate. I've seen some floating 3D sprites and trees that goes through rocks and some terrain deformities (with stretched textures), but usually you have to look really close for these types of minor glitches. The one visual glitch that occurs the most is the one with parts of the scope disappearing after you take a shot.With all this being said, I really hope the developers listens to the community and addresses these issues. I'm really looking forward to future patches and updates, it can only get better from here and hopefully we'll have our hands on the best hunting experience one can have on a PC. I tried to summarize my experience with the game so far in this review, for the developers and others thinking about buying it, just to let you know what you can expect from it at its current state. I have no complaints about the sounds nor the visuals, but as for now I'll give this game a rating of ""Not recommended"" until it gets some fixes.			"

												This really deserves a much higher rating from buyers. If you're even remotely interested in the title buy it. Honestly wouldn't put it past special interest groups to buy the game just to run the rating down. Anyhow I can't figure out what most of the bad review are talking about.Breaking down into pros and cons....Pros- ran 60 to 90 fps without any drops on 1080 custom all ultra- in several hours I unlocked 1/5 of the map and explored maybe 1/20. It would take weeks to explore just one of the two maps completely. It is absolutely huge!- Absolutely gorgeous open world environment. One of the best I've seen in any genre.- Better animal AI than i've seen in any game.- Great rpg skill building. No just running out and shooting rockets on the first day. (ok rockets is hyperbole)-quite realistic tracking after wounding. I made a bad shot on one animal and tracked it for over an hour in the dark. Unfortunately the AI did just what real deer do. It circled back on its own tracks several times till I couldn't tell which way it went in the dark anymore.-don't worry it's easy enough to make a good kill shot with even the .243 you start with. I read one report that made it sound like it happened every time. Not sure what they expect for a starter rifle? 475 h&h maybe? That was only one of many I shot that turned out that way.-No da*n bango music. For anyone that remembers the hunting games where you had the volume turned way up to hear animals and bam, suddenly you forget when you pause it blares frackn banjo music.-I started on the European map. Pleasant voice acting. Very well done.-And the list goes on, but I'll stick to the basicsCons - One time.... One time a deer got stuck....- The store interface just felt a little clunky. Not really bad or game breaking. Very minor update would do it. Really it might just be a matter of preference like ford dash controls vs. volvo.This is one of a very few games i'd say absolutely buy it. It's worth the $30. But hey if you're the next warren buffett or something by all means wait for a sale. (ok i seriously doubt he's a gamer... just sayin) "

												This game was released a little early for my liking. It feels like a Beta and there are quite a few bugs. That's the negative. The positive is that the graphics is really great and the gameplay, which may not suit COD fans, is slow and deliberate. This is as close to real life as you can get.Am I glad I bought it? Yes, the bugs will get fixed. DLCs will come out with new reserves and gear. Bear with it. It's still great game with more potential the classic version. It was relatively cheap. Don't curse the Devs, no-one can write perfect code. It was a rush to market, probably for financial reasons. It's just as frustrating as real life when you don't take the time to get a perfect shot. Lots of work ahead, but it's still a great game.			"

												If wandering through a wood seeing no wildlife is your thing....wander through a wood seeing no wildlife, at least you'll get fresh air and exercise. This game makes little attempt to gently induct beginners; it has a poorly designed ""tutorial"", which says things like ""you should see some tracks"". You don't. Then you wander aimlessly, with the game randomly selecting a gun,or  a lure or binoculors without explanation, until you stumble on where the map is and a blue pointer then magically appears guiding you to a target. But it leads to nothing. Not even with binocuours 2 metres away.The binocular vison is blurred and it's almost impossible to pan, as you inexplicably have to hold down right click as you look for...nothing. I never really got started with this but then there was nothing to get started on even after an hour - that's an hour of my life I won't get back but thankfully Steam's refund policy means at least I'll get the not inconsiderable price of the game back.

												This game would be very good, however the vast amount of glitches and difficult user interface makes it very unapealing im not sure who greenlit this to be able to purchase but they jumped the gun. The rifles are the only real weapons you can use in game, pistols are a joke because you can get close enough to even get a shot. The shotguns are pretty useless and they affer bird shot which there are not even any birds in game to use it on they just fall out of the sky and blow into a bunch of feathers as well are not even on the list of animals to hunt. the scoring is pretty usless as well, takes for ever to level up weapons, and again for the pistols good luck ever unlocking a new one because to get there you would litterally have to make skilled shots with iron sights and have to kill around 200 animals. For me and im not sure if it is for everyone else but i tried to do the first quest and it wouldnt let me advance through it. This game could have been great but it almsot seems as if they lost funding and just said screw it and released it with a ton of errors.			"

When you get a kill, the game gives u a generic score for each kill...... just a number that doesnt mean anything substantial to you because there is no comprehensive scoring system anymore..... incredibly dissappointing....3. NEED ZONES!!! AWESOME BUT OH WAIT I CANT PLACE A TENT OR A TREE STAND ................................................. wtf is the point of the need zone then....4. HUGE MAP.... YUGE!!!!!

Updated Animal Models (what i have been begging to have for years..)...... and got rid of the obsessive amounts of pay to play store items.... this game would be amazing, I would go out hunt animals earn xp do quests buy ammo and guns place my tents and stands and have a ton of fun..... >_< ..... so sad... i was waiting for this.... hopefully it gets better.....

I am deeply confused - what's this game supposed to be?Sandbox game? Hunting ""Simulation""? Arcade Hunter? Open World Adventure?First of all: Endless, purposeless tranquilityif you enjoy walking up a beautiful virtual hill for 15 minutes without any further purpose but to reach a viewing platform, then this game is totally for you and you should just ignore my review.Second: Oh my god, dem bugs. Others have mentioned it before, but this game is far from being ready for release. For early access the level of bugs and issues would have been acceptable, but still better to call it an open beta.The main problem I have with this, is that ExpansiveWorlds (Avalanche Studios) has a long-standing track record of releasing unfinished content and often never polishing it to perfection even way later. This is true for basically every update theHunter:classic received, but especially for theHunter:Primal - a game that was sold in some kind of beta-state (especially content-wise) and never made it any further.Third: Blimey, dem graphics!The game looks awesome! The vegetation, the scenery, the lighting, the animal models, the animations (well, besides the players hands, what the frog am I doing? Running in the praying mantis karate base pose?) - all looks terrific and stunning. The way you leave a trail of flattened grass behind is just cool. Ok, it looks like you're a Mafiosi that just dragged a concrete-cuffed rival to his favourite dumpster lake, but hey, it's still a cool effect. A shame that the graphics are the only outstanding part of this game. I am more willing to overlook less-than-perfect graphics than flawed game design or mechanics.Last but by no means least - the real review - what is this game meant to be and why did they get it all backwards?So you got theHunter:classic, a massive open-world hunting game with plenty of content and great game mechanics. It just suffers from a meanwhile rather dated graphic engine  (fair enough being already 8 years old) and a microtransaction-based business model that has met plenty of criticism. Yet the cash-cow seems still lactating, as they are still keeping the game alive.So what to do to lead theHunter into the future. Develop a successor and kill your cash flow of the old game? Much better to produce something slightly different that recruits new customers, fascinates your old clientèle and still doesn't stop them from spending on the old one. Much better idea indeed. If you're able to pull it off, that is.So why not make an open world hunting game like the hunter that still has a story line. Red Dead Redemption hunting themed, basically. Nice idea.But then why they got it all backwards? Why does the actual hunting feel like you're mowing down the imbecile cousins of some majestic animals you dreamt of hunting all your life? The actual hunting is no challenge at all, you just need to be in the right place, and the animals will be easy to harvest.The ""story line"" (in brackets, as I am not sure yet, there's any red line through the story - it might just be random bits) on the other hand is slow as a sloth. A couple of hours in and I haven't even proceeded much in the tutorial story line (it is supposed to be a tutorial, right?). All I did is wander lengthily through a beautiful landscape getting sidetracked by some dull hunting while trying to get to a lodge or view point or camp.I feel a good hunting game with a story line should be exactly the other way around: extensive, to some extend challenging hunting embedded in a faster paced, enthralling story line. That'd be an interesting cross-over game between an emersion-intense hunting game and a hunting-themed arcade/adventure game. This game is exactly the opposite. It got real dull real quick for me, and I am a sucker for a good hunting game.I'll probably wait for a follow-up of theHunter:classic. Or maybe even a similar product by a competent competitor that might be released in a rather finished state - one should be allowed to dream big.			"

												Do not under any circumstances buy if you're on an Ultrawide Monitor.  I can't attest to the actual gameplay because it's pretty unplayable at 21:9 ratio.  I got the UI to show up totally by changing my resolution to a differant ratio but it looked terrible.  I can't attest to the gameplay for those on regular resolution monitors so I'd check other reviews for that.  I can say that in the first minute of being in the game other than it looking terrible I was stuck being prone until I found a fix for that.  Not really a good start.  This is a game I still plan on playing but definitely not right now.  I requested a refund as it's unplayable.			"

This is no AAA title granted but we as players of the old game have been funding this progression. If you left this game 3 years from now then played it again a lot of people would have opposite opinions to what thay have now. If you give this game time to evolve like thehunter classic then this will turn out to be a top notch game. The same is going to happen with this game.

												Do not buy yet.  This is a beta game still.  Game runs great, no crashes, awesome graphics.  However, the reason I stopped playiing classic was the 220meter draw distance.  The new engine is suppose to draw farther, it does not.  You will get a mission early on to kill to fallow deer in some corn field.  When you look to the second field it is not rendered.  There are camp sites, rest areas, you will find and you cannot rest in them.  I assume we need a tent that is not in game yet.  WIth an up to date computer the game runs great, just paying $40 for a shell of a game is stupid.  I suppose they were out of money.			"

												Love this game. Quick to load,easy to play and damn hard to get a good kill with noobie gear. Lots of map space, POI's story line and quests. Lots of excitement every now and then. Gameply hunting wise is not linear, so you have no idea how long a low bloodloss  trail will last. You can run for ages after an animal and never get to it or it may just fall few 100m from the shot. Love watching Youtube clips on hunts and their comments / tactics. The main thing is its fun! Not a high stress game. Take advantage of bugs  where animals get sutck, guns and XP is not cheap. You pay for building of hunting lookouts. Ammo is not cheap! Few minor tweaks and it will be perfect. NOTHING beats the view and the fact that you can spot animals miles away! Sound is excellent but need few close-up tweaks.This is MY review, and I think this game is AWESOME! "

												If you plan on using mouse/keyboard don't get this game in its current state. If you use a controller you'll have a much better experience. Alot of the rage experienced is form mouse/keyboard users and I am one of those users. Luckily I can use my xbox controller on my computer when needed cuz the regular UI hates keyboard mouse. Besides that for gameplay itself its not too bad. there are some bugs, like I've seen animals stuck in terrain but it makes it an easy kill lol. Doesn't happen often but it does happen. A lot of things in the game have no tooltips or any explanation so sure you can tell me that I received no ""integrity bonus"" for a kill but without telling me what that is what am I supposed to do with that information?  Also avoid using special ironsights, they are auto unequipped anytime you switch out from holding the weapon which is all the time.  Game is slowly getting patches and it still fun, you can loose yourself tracking animals for ages but this game isn't meant to be a FPS where you lock and load, run into the forest and spray lead across a field and spend the next hour harvesting bodies. The is a patience game, a low key game. And it does that well. I can't wait for subsequent patches as it will make this game so much better. My only concern is if they release pay content before fixing the issues and interface.			"

												Awesome buy for $30 as is. Anyone that's ever done any actual hunting knows this is the best hunting game to date. Finally something better than Deer Hunter 2005 that isn't P2W. I'm hoping to see them implement a dynamic rack system, more animal types and models, and more weapons. But considering it's priced at $30 as a ""complete"" game, I'm not expecting much. Which is a shame, because a little more polish and this game could have sold for $50-$60 easily.			"

												Okay. First of all, really good game, I just bought and donwloaded it a few days ago and I've already logged over ten hours. Second, this game is a tad bit broken. It has crashed several times on me and I am worried that I won't be able to play this anymore if this continues. I'll say it again, this game is really good. So just fix the crashing problem, please.			"

Finally what i will say is buy this game, it may not be finished but in a couple months in i believe the game will have had all issues fixed and more things adeed, its a fantastic game and if you let stupid things like a poor ui stop your from playing it then you should probably just delete steam.

												It just doesn't make sense to have an amazing looking game crash, and have this bad of a menu system. Here is the break down:The game is beautiful graphics wise when you crank it up to Ultra everything but when there are so many bugs it becomes unplayable.There is only one player profile across the board. What you do online is the same as if you play solo mode. (example: I dropped a gun online, it was gone in single player as well. (I create a New Game, it just resets my spawn point of my other game but I have same items skills etc...)The Menus are just a developers nightmear. They never work and 50% of the game you have to move in and out of the menus to change guns, ammo etc... I found myself using my arrow keys and enter key to navigate, and that only works like 70% of the time, but a little better then clicking with a mouse. MENU SYSTEM MUST BE WORKED ON before you buy!There is no leaving a game! Thats right, you can't leave a single player game or a online player game and go directly back to the main menu... You Exit to desktop every time! So if i am playing single player, and my firend gets online and is like join my game... I have to exit the entire game to re-launch it then go to multi player. Multiplayer is a bit buggy, There lag system is broken. Peer to Peer style play. I was just about to bag a nice buck and bam the host left the game, Here is the kicker, The entire game shuts down, Not a crash it ♥♥♥♥ing shuts down?!?! No ♥♥♥♥s where given!Deer and animals get stuck in rocks and ♥♥♥♥ all the time.Single player is way to easy to play, every second there is a sound from an animal or a trailMutliplayer is much more..... its a bit real, animals are harder to find and you need your actual skills to find ♥♥♥♥. I'm not trying to bash this game its just not finnished, its more of a beta then a final game. Don't get me wrong, the game has its ups which would be graphics, I've never seen a deer hunter game look so great in my life. Till the game gets patched with the bugs and suggestions I made above... Its a hard hard pass.			"

												This game is visually very beautiful. I forgot I was there to hunt for the first hour and just got lost in the woods. When It did get down to the tracking and shooting an animal the game really stands out, as did the classic. It felt intense as you stalked your pray through the bush, finally causght sight of it, lines up your shot and dropped in with a nice hit to the lungs. 10/10 would forget I was not just there to look at the pretty scenery again.

												This is an exceptional hunting experience. The graphics in this game are truly breathtaking and the animations of the animals is detailed. This comes at the cost of performance but it is well worth upgrading your machine just to experience this game on ultra the vistas are jaw dropping.Theres a couple of clipping issues with some rare holes in the mesh where you can see under the terrain at the water plane. I ran into choppy audio but I've got a feeling this is my processor stuggling to keep up. The game seems to be taking up above 90 percent of my processors resources and my graphics card only has 2 gig of vram. To enjoy ultra textures you will need at least a 4gig card but it's well worth it. One thing i did notice though is when i shone my torch at the animal it didn't spook. I don't know if this happens maybe the animal freezes up in shock from the light. Maybe have it realistically reacting to torchlight is a feature you can add.Recommended!			"

												People say ""bugs"". Well what bugs are you having? Mind telling us instead? I'm enjoying this game very much. I'm having one problem that I don't know if I can call bug but, when you're standing on a track you've tracked, and you hear an animal call, you can't check that call because it will check for the track you're standing on. Instead you have to run away from that track and then check the call. That's the only problem I've had so far, everything else is good. I would totally recommend this game to those who like grinding a bit.			"

												Wow, 80 hours already. I think this is also my first Steam review.I enjoy theHunter COTW. At the core it is a hunting simulator, and in that regard it performs somewhat admirably. The landscapes in both playable maps are expansive and beautiful. The game engine really brings out the beauty of these hunting grounds whether it's a clear summer day or moonlit foggy night. Seeing the jagged antlers of the buck you've been intently tracking for what seems like hours shimmer in the sun while it trots within the tall foliage is quite the sight to see. The sun's rays sometimes glow through the trees, creating an ambience that causes you to stop and just take it all in. Through numerous patches that have come after the game's release, the game is in, at least for me, a playable state. As mentioned in many other reviews perhaps these bugs should have been ironed out before release. I won't get into that debate as it seems to be the industry-wide norm. Bugs are minimal now, animal pathing and AI seems to be working more reliabely (though with some major faults, such as herd behavior). I haven't spontaneously combusted by walking between two rocks or two saplings in a long time. Sure, there's still some issues with terrain and how the player/animals interact with it, buggy/misplaced things such as grass hanging in the air, etc. With a map this expansive there are bound to be some issues and animals will eventually get stuck. This is part of the process and is something I can live with. However, due to my aforementioned herd behavior mention, if an animal as part of a herd does manage to bug out on a rock and get stuck, the rest of the animals will circle voilently around it until it dies (or you get trampled). This can lead to some funny/fruitful opportunities but as a hunting simulator it greatly detracts from the immersion. Multiplayer is bare bones minimal. The single-player questing system is absent in the multiplayer version, instead replaced with competitions you can start with other players. These include hitting an animal in the heart first, bagging 3 fallow deer trophies, etc. While it can be a worthy distraction it would have been nice to be able to quest with other players. Especially with those difficult missions (high level photos, gold star ratings, etc.). There remains the issue of connected players to a host server being unable to unlock new landmarks/outposts, etc. I personally never join a server if I play multiplayer as I always want the option, so I host. It explains why there are so many servers with just 1 player in them.My issue is that this developer seems to be following the trend. A console release has been announced recently and with the lack of updates it will only get worse in my opinion. A guise of two separate console and PC development teams is their only defense - just take a look at the patch note comments. The sad truth is that development for the PC version will slow until they get their cash flow from the console release. The game takes a modestly beefy PC to render the graphics at their ultimate potential, and a lot of people don't have the pcmasterrace in them.  If they get a console version that runs at 30 FPS and has full game pad support, a lot of people might hop on that boat. Why wouldn't they release a console version? Lotta money potential. And that seems to be their game - hey, it's a business. TLDR - Console development is a money maker. PC development will likely slow. I enjoy the game, but I can't support the business model as a consumer. I understand it though. Try getting the game when it's on sale. Or, you know... Eat a citrus fruit so you don't get scurvy, matey... 6.5/10			"

												Though I am not a very good hunter  I still played  the Hunter a fashionable number of hours and enjoyed it very much, even though it had some quirks  and features like micro sales which I find unpalatable but still  it is lush and immensely enjoyable . So when I saw Hunter cotw I thought it would be  a very nice game to buy  and it was at first . I started a new hunter  and learned the rules through the lush wood of Hirshfelden  and grew quite fond of it  then I discovered  problems and bugs such as the animal falling  when hit ,  then starting up  again which prevented me  from  total immersion  animals caught in the textures and keeping running  through, stationarily  but ok  every games has its quirk and I should not complain about it  but still ... This game has a great potential and  is far from reaching it  and Sadly it is embedded in its structure. You have no save... let me explain  You have 2 hunting  territories Leyton lake and Hirshfelden  and you can't  use the same build  of character in the other reservation  worse than that. You'll have to start again in the previous one if you start a new game I was utterly dismayed  when I discovered it . When you  launch a game if you  level up through it  you usually know that your character is going to  be with you even if you start a new one or in the case of The hunter  you don’t lose anything when you start another game. I hope that  I made my point and  would like expensive world to add this particular feature (which is a save mechanism) in order to make the game really enjoyable  and longer lasting. Please consider what I said before buying it It is not a bad game of itself but it is  quite limited Have a good gaming and see you for my next review.			"

												Totally unfinished game. So many bugs and annoyances, that I don't even wan't to start listing. Graphics have gone better from original The Hunter, but everything else is major step backwards.Edit. Maybe I do some sort of list after all:Map is next to useless. You can't recognize anything else than the biggest topographical variations. I would like to see normal topographical map. Animal behaviour is dumb. Normally animals stand still for very long periods of time. Not here, they just wonder endless circels and rarely stop for eating. You can see bear and deer walking 10m apart happily not caring each other. If you wound an animal, its very difficult to catch them ever again, because they run like hell dispite the injury. Scenery is really nice and atmosphere realistic. I really like the sound when you are walkin on small rocks :)I have played original The Hunter for several hundreds of hours and can't understand why to create another gameplay where you boost graphics very nicely and f*ck up all the rest?I'm sure that more patches are coming and they are going to fix many bugs. At this point this game is only for real enthusiasts.			"

												Hi,I discovered this game yesterday on my personal queue, i was surprised the game was published today ! I bought the game for the environment design. Gorgeous landscapes. One of the Best vegetation in games i have seen recently.I apreciate the fact that the game doesnt force you into doing some scripted actions at the begining. You are free to do anything you want. If you like exploration, you are served.So i walked straigth for a few minutes, looking at the amazing environment, weather, everything, the atmosphere is just too good. You are there in the wild, and the camps are nicely positionned.Then i noticed some deer footsteps on the ground, so i began to follow the traces, a long time passed, 10-20 mins until i found a group of deer, im not even sure it was the original one that i followed i may have lost track multiple times and followed some new traces by mistake.This first contact with the animals was a great mess, missed the shots, scared them away. took me 30 more mins to find my first trophee. :pIve seen the post with the list of animals, for the moment i met a rabbit, a fox, some deers, a ram, i heard a boar, didnt see him, im definitely going to spend many hours and hunt them down.I used to play Far cry for the hunting/exploration part, If you like hunting, you should buy this immediately.

												Beatiful game and great fun aswell, but I can't truly recommend yet, until a few things is fixed. First of all there is quite a few annoying bugs, one is that after tracking a wounded moose for a full hour the tracks suddenly disappear. Tracks also tends to disappear altogether, you don't see any tracks at all. Another is hurting yourself for no reason, i lost 75% of my health after touching a tree with my shoulder and diend once after walking in to a firplant.Huge and beatiful landscape, but no vehicles? You can fast travel between camps but the distances are still great and makes the game a truly walk simulator. You can't enter the game menu after you start a game, therefor you have to quit the game and restart it to go to the main menu(Did the developers even try the game?). Multiplayer is fun but one really bad thing is that you cannot unlock any or use points of interest like hunting stands or look out towers at all if you join another players game.Animals stuck in the air is another ugly bug i a game with stunning graphics and enviroment. Resting in a cabin, wich you claim cost money. Sneaking without a controller can't be done unless you tap on W, an even then it's not working right(Once again,dear developers did you actually try the game?). 2 animals have spotted me, 19 smelled me and 1231 have heard me.That's pretty dumb when I believe the game is PC exclusive? Also the game tends to freeze or crash more and more often. Crash or freezes while walking, changing wepons, use lures, pick up lures. I got a constant crash situiation when running west from the Schonfield outpost on Hirschfelden.After they fix many of the bugs I will recommend this game to everyone, and for the love of god give us some kind of transportation and the ability to wait in hunting nests.2017-03-15 Update: Exit to Main MenuOur intention was to bring an “Exit to Main Menu” option to the game with today’s patch but it is unfortunately not ready yet. We are aware that this feature is requested, we just need a bit more time to guarantee that it works flawlessly.Yes, this is still a problem=)			"

												Having played over 1000 Hours in the orginal TheHunter game, I have to say this game impressed me,it has improved on many of the things we enjoyed about the original. Now they have also made skill trees and you level up to unlock the better guns to buy and the better equipment now. The graphics are beautiful and my rig get a stead 30 fps with mostly high and some ultra settings on.They do need to optimize the game a bit better, as the fps drops in some areas are worse than others.But hardly anything game breaking. Overall i would have to Recommend the game highly if you like Hunting games. This one is Best on steam for sure.			"

												Great game, will be chaning to positive as soon as moajor bugs are fixed. game looks GREAT its FUN been looking for a good hunter game for awhile BUT game crashes sometimes to desktop sometimes crashes pc which makes it unplayable atm, then theres 2 kinds of SCOPE GLITCHES have had them bot, 1. after you take a shot it goes to iron sight and then back into scope which makes it hard to hit a possible 2nd shot with the ""fast aim perk"" 2. you are looking into the scope from far away and shot will NOT be accurate, restart fixed that but appeared again another time. Last thing is it me or is there no back to MENU? have to exit to desktop to switch map? Also the inventory and backpack needs better layout it screams console.- cant recommend mainly casue crashes.EDIT : after patch 1.1 the crashes are far less 2 so far over 2 days, only to desktop no more pc crash caused. after 1.11 the scope bugs are gone, but between shots it still goes to iron sight for 0.1sec between shots with quick aim perk. still no back to menu option, still good fun and can def be played but still some really anoying small bugs hoping to get fixed in next round, rly wanna change it to recomended :)EDITEDIT: game still crashes just less frequent but still enough to not wanna play since it can happen anytime just as you about to complete something.

												Great Game!I don't think I to date have ever played a game with a more visually appealing and realistic representation of the great outdoors!In-fact I am frequently placed in something of an environmental ""uncanny valley"" as part of me actually feels like the wind should be hitting my face, and the smell of the forest should be filling my nostrils.It's going through a lot of growing pains which I feel confident the developers will resolve in time, but despite its buggy state will still gladly recommend this game, as it provides a hunting experience and atmosphere like none other in a game!

												Very pretty game, intense hunting sequences broken up by a beautiful walking simulator. Unfortunately, it's totally broken. Purchased weapons don't show up in inventory, and I shuffled inventory on my hotbar and the game ate my roe deer caller for my troubles. The store indicates that it's ""owned"", but it's nowhere to be found in my inventory and can't be equipped. Same with the .223 rifle and jackrabbit caller I've purchased. Plus, the sound is buggy as hell. This one needs significant work before I can recommend it, but I really really hope they get it together because 90% of an awesome game is already there.			"

												After 3 hours of playing i can say its a really great hunting game Are there bugs? yes most games out there have some bugs but the are fixing it ok :)  and if you shose not to buy because of that you gonna lose somting great when it comes to hunting game.Open world and scenery is beautiful i say just wow i run on ultra and high play around and find your sweet spot in the settings and give this game a chans. and remeber this is not thehunter classic yes the share some simular key features between them but this is a new game and veteran Classic players gonna feel at home :) Pros:  Open worldGorgeous graphicsGood tutorial and hint for new huntersNo licenses for animals, No pay to play for those that dont like thatand yes you can jump now i did missing that in classicProgression system is really nice with the xp and money and weapon skill thats how you become good in the game.You can run around for hours and just look with out hunting if so, and more Cons:  yes there are some bugs but the are fixing it thats great :)  tracking in game is  confusing first time you try it out but you learn how it works. small graphic errors/lag only have 1 so far but there are not much i can say that are bad about this game yes the are ppl that have some crash and bugs and erros but let them work even GTA 5 did have bugs from start those that give a bad review because of that thats worng in my opinion.

												It just doesn't make sense to have an amazing looking game crash, and have this bad of a menu system. Here is the break down:The game is beautiful graphics wise when you crank it up to Ultra everything but when there are so many bugs it becomes unplayable.There is only one player profile across the board. What you do online is the same as if you play solo mode. (example: I dropped a gun online, it was gone in single player as well. (I create a New Game, it just resets my spawn point of my other game but I have same items skills etc...)The Menus are just a developers nightmear. They never work and 50% of the game you have to move in and out of the menus to change guns, ammo etc... I found myself using my arrow keys and enter key to navigate, and that only works like 70% of the time, but a little better then clicking with a mouse. MENU SYSTEM MUST BE WORKED ON before you buy!There is no leaving a game! Thats right, you can't leave a single player game or a online player game and go directly back to the main menu... You Exit to desktop every time! So if i am playing single player, and my firend gets online and is like join my game... I have to exit the entire game to re-launch it then go to multi player. Multiplayer is a bit buggy, There lag system is broken. Peer to Peer style play. I was just about to bag a nice buck and bam the host left the game, Here is the kicker, The entire game shuts down, Not a crash it ♥♥♥♥ing shuts down?!?! No ♥♥♥♥s where given!Deer and animals get stuck in rocks and ♥♥♥♥ all the time.Single player is way to easy to play, every second there is a sound from an animal or a trailMutliplayer is much more..... its a bit real, animals are harder to find and you need your actual skills to find ♥♥♥♥. I'm not trying to bash this game its just not finnished, its more of a beta then a final game. Don't get me wrong, the game has its ups which would be graphics, I've never seen a deer hunter game look so great in my life. Till the game gets patched with the bugs and suggestions I made above... Its a hard hard pass.			"

												I will keep this simple and straight to the point, they say this is a fully playable release, it is not.The game crashes constantly, too many bugs to count off, and I mean game breaking bugs, walk into a tree, die, animals disappear, some even invisible, scope bugs, where you cannot use your scope at all, kind of bugs.Do not be decieved and fooled to buy this game, it looks nice, but underneath the nice plsatic advertisement wrap is a steaming pile of broken ♥♥♥♥ that they tried to pass off as a ""fast-track Alpha game"". This game should have been advertised as still in Alpha, and sold and advertised as such.I emplore you, do not buy this game, it is bad, bad in a broken, cannot play kind of way.I deeply regret buying this, the hours I spent stalking animals to not be able to claim them, follow them after they have been hit because of tracking bugs, and game crashing after you slaughter a herd of elk from long range, only to have all that time spent stalking and killing every last one, lost, because of a stinking crash.Be warned, be wary, and do research about the game you want to buy and play before buying.

												This game is absolutely gorgeous. Everything about this game excited me from the first time I saw it. Coming from the original theHunter, this is a breath of fresh air. No subscriptions. No penalties for wrong caliber. This is really an open-world hunting experience that can be sort of mission based if you choose, or not. Pros: Graphics, Animals, Realism, Map, ""Noccys"" (Binoculars).Cons:Bugs, Glitchy Animal AI, No ""Back to Main Menu"" Option.I feel that at this price point, this game is a steal. 30$ may seem steep, but AAA titles like Madden and FIFA release the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game every year, riddled with microransactions and ways for them to make money... ON TOP OF A 60$ PRICE TAG. This game is worth the money, and with a few patches, it can definitely become a great game. Have patience: not only in the game hunting a bear, but with the development team on patching bugs.			"

												I like it. I haven't played many other hunting games before but this game is pretty good. It has just been released so there is bound to be some patching that needs to be done. Animals might get stuck on a rock in rare cases or the sound when you sneak is louder than it should be (This is already fixed). The multiplayer is pretty good too, the large maps can let you have several friends and still be able to hunt by yourself. 8/10			"

												I am truly disappointed in this game so far. Looks so amazing yet the amount of bugs tells me they rushed to release. Not to mention the horrible gui. For gods sake get rid of that annoying beep while navigating the menu. Besides the game not being playable for me (buggy, not a system spec problem). While as visually appealing as it is. They have missed the mark. The entire experience is dulled by the Gui, and lack of customization. You start the game with no idea what to do. For me I was unable to see tracks at all until I installed on my other pc and then I was finally able to see the tracks glow. Then that quit working on that pc.  Sigh's after about 5hrs of gameplay I still have not found out how to buy weapons or change camo. Maybe part of this is because of my inability to play properly due to bugs. effects not working invincible animals etc.Or maybe just because the game has no proper gui and seems half done. If the dev's would read this then I would note that personally I love ""The Hunter Classic"" and have poored a large chunk of money into it.  So please, bring back ALL the things that made the original great...Things like the huntermate beeing used to track. An intuitive menu that allows for quick and easy access to all equiptment and customizations. All the amazing hunting types. Turkey, ducks, etc. With all that said, I think the reason I am so disappointed is because I feel very pationate about this game. I was hoping for at least what I was able to get from the original. Then after the failure of primal. I purchase a third installment and once again feel let down. Now at the game's current state I would not recommend this at all. Maybe a year down the road they may be able to get this working. Although so far they cant even get primal to save the game. So, yah for me you guys have close to $300 from me. I am am not likely to buy anything else unless I see some serious improvements in the direction of your games.			"

												The game is a huge upgrade from the original ""theHunter"". They turned the game from a pseudo pay-to-win simulator into a grinding game that makes you want to keep playing. The visuals are absolutely stunning and the general gameplay got oh so very polished.On a side note there are still quite a few bugs here and there, while not gamebreaking they are still a pain and will hopefully be fixed as soon as possible.All in all for a 30€ game, if you are a fan of hunting, I would definitely recommend this gem.

												With hundreds and hundreds of hours in the original I was a bit skepitcal about this at first. Glad I a took the plunge.It has THE best natural landscapes in any game I have played, as well as the BEST realistic looking lighting I have ever seen in any game ever. Even the way the forest is constructed looks incredibly accurate down to the stages of plant growth and variety. Top marks for that.The animals look and move MUCH more realistically then the original game, Although I have heard reports of terrible pathfinding from the AI and have wittnessed this myself on a few occasions, The most memorable was cornering an entire heard of fallow deer in a nook in a cliff face, all the deer ran in circles I moved in and just sat there shooting at them untill I had about all 8 of them down, it was figurativly shooting fish in a barrel. Only a few times have I seen other pathfinding fails. Mostly they run into rocks and spaz out. This doesn't really bother me as it doesn't happen too often.I have only seen 2 graphical glitches both are minor and not really worth mentioning.The ONLY BUG so far to cause me trouble is with the ammuntition, It takes rifle skill points to unlock different types of ammo, I have unlocked the .270 rifle and saved up and bought it, the ammo was unlocked with the rifle But when I go to buy the ammo it still say locked and won't let me get it... the rifle cant be used without it.I am totally happy with this game and how this series is progressing, PROVIDING this minor and major bugs are fixed reasonably quickly. It also shows my need to upgrade my aging GTX780 as High settings are about as good as I can go and get reasonable framerate.			"

												10/10 would track a black bear for an hour and lose it again This game is great. First off, you need certain traits to be able to properly enjoy this game, and most of all, you need certain specs to be able to run the game to its full capacity  to even be able to properly enjoy it the way it is supposed to be enjoyed/played. Right now, there are a couple glitches I've encountered within the game, but nothing worth writing a bad review over or even mentioning. This game is visually, one of the most beautiful games that I've ever played. The sounds of the forest, the rain, the sounds of the rifle, everything visually and auditory is breathtakingly beautiful.You can go an hour following tracks, and end up with nothing or a missed shot.. or you can see two black bears and two coyotes within an hour. It's hit and miss and makes for a great thrill when you finally find the prey you've been tracking. Overall, this is a great game with very minor glitches that don't change the game in the slightest. I definitely recommend buying this if you have the patience to endure it. It's totally worth it.			"

												Everyone else is covering the bad stuff, so I'll leave it at this - a few bugs, nothing that I'm not able to work around. I'm sure they will be patched out soon. Otherwise, very immersive hunting experience. Yes, there are lots of ways to find metric ♥♥♥♥ tons of wildlife. Why does that have to be a bad thing? It feels great to sit in a bush at a feeding ground and pick off everything that walks up with a bow. Since you need in-game money to buy new guns/ammo, the balance feels right. Every kill gives at least enough money for a whole box of bullets or arrows. Wait for it to go on sale maybe, then it will be definitely worth it!			"

												Although visuals are stunning and the sounds are really good, this game has a lot of problemsGame has a ton of bugs, especially in multiplayer. For example, 2 people can't stand together in a watchtower, as they both die pretty much instantly. The animals ""warning calls"" seem really random, sometimes triggering when standing completely still with no visibility.My friend could hear my deer caller from 2km away, and it sounded like it was 1m away. This got really annoying.To make matters worse, we found out my friend couldn't see a certain deer i wanted him to kill, not even after i killed it and showed him where the body was. He didn't see any deers for 1 hour before this which makes be believe it's because he COULDNT see them.Sadly i played for 4 hours, so i guess i won't be eligible for a refund.			"

												I never thought I'd see myself falling in love with a hunting game, but theHunter: Call of the Wild has its claws in me and I'm not mad about it. The thrill of the hunt is visceral. You have to rely on sight and sound in a way that few games pull off. Hunting with friends is even better than hunting alone. One person can post up while the other wrangles or lures the prey. It's just dripping with fun if you give yourself the time to get lost in its world. The maps are huge, beautiful, and varied, with plenty of nice set pieces to stumble upon.On the downside, the game is riddled with annoying bugs. Often they require a full restart, which is made worse by the fact that you can't simply back out to the main menu, you MUST quit to the desktop to exit the game. Ironsights will occasionally bug out, activating multiplayer quests will boot your friends from your game, animals will get stuck on geometry, netting you easy kills that cheapen the experience.All of that said, the gameplay is worth dealing with the bugs and it seems the devs are working hard to fix the problems.Pros:Gorgeous VisualsExcellent Sound DesignDamn Fun Gameplay!Cons:Bugs, bugs, bugs			"

And it's always the same with EW, they release broken stuff but they eventually get it working most of the times and I'm feeling that they will fix most of the issues they can.+Huge Maps+Lots of Animals+Missions are fun and some are challenging+Night Hunting+Multiplayer (- if you are not the host you can't discover new lookouts, outposts, lores nor build towers)-Lots of bugs-Optimization is not the best-Huge grind to get moneyIf you are not so sure about getting the game just wait a couple of weeks or until it gets a sale.

												Watch Out for this game.  I tried to return it but, I spent several hours trying to get in to work correctly and therefore listed as played more than 2 hours, and not eligable for return.!   thanks steam!So I worked my buns off trying to work with tech and was finally able to play but it is so full of bugs I FINALLY GAVE UP AND REMOVED IT FROM MY SYSTEM....  So disapointing .. that a game would be launched so buggy and unplayable most the time..   Thanks for protecting us from this type of crap Steam..    I am very disapointed in you ""STEAM"" as well.  not good. Hope I get better service in the furture Guys. "

												im having fun with this game. i never really played thehunter classic... only sometimes... but the real problem with thehunter classic was that u need to pay for so many things if u want to start big. thats why i never played thehunter classic but this game is just what i wanted. i can shoot everything if i want to... i dont have to buy a damn license... i just shoot them. Pro:you can kill every animal without any licensethe map (hirschfeld) is really bigthe exploring of new outposts is really nicethe graphics are nice too, i think this is a really beatiful gamei was almost killed by a horde of deers because i shot at them and they were running at me (lost half hp from 2 deers)etcthe game is well optimised (FX 6300 @4 GHz, 8 GB Ram DDR3, RX480 8GB) i play on high with 70 fpsneutral: there are some bugs (scope is bugged, you get sometimes random disconnects if u play with a friend and if u do u cant conquer any new outposts)SOME animals are bugged but mostly because they were bleeding and running away and got stuck at a stoneContra: all these negative reviewsSo if u didnt like thehunter classic because of all these licenses and/or graphics, you should give this game a try, its not that bad as all reviews say.

												Everyone else is covering the bad stuff, so I'll leave it at this - a few bugs, nothing that I'm not able to work around. I'm sure they will be patched out soon. Otherwise, very immersive hunting experience. Yes, there are lots of ways to find metric ♥♥♥♥ tons of wildlife. Why does that have to be a bad thing? It feels great to sit in a bush at a feeding ground and pick off everything that walks up with a bow. Since you need in-game money to buy new guns/ammo, the balance feels right. Every kill gives at least enough money for a whole box of bullets or arrows. Wait for it to go on sale maybe, then it will be definitely worth it!			"

												People say ""bugs"". Well what bugs are you having? Mind telling us instead? I'm enjoying this game very much. I'm having one problem that I don't know if I can call bug but, when you're standing on a track you've tracked, and you hear an animal call, you can't check that call because it will check for the track you're standing on. Instead you have to run away from that track and then check the call. That's the only problem I've had so far, everything else is good. I would totally recommend this game to those who like grinding a bit.			"

												This game is visually very beautiful. I forgot I was there to hunt for the first hour and just got lost in the woods. When It did get down to the tracking and shooting an animal the game really stands out, as did the classic. It felt intense as you stalked your pray through the bush, finally causght sight of it, lines up your shot and dropped in with a nice hit to the lungs. 10/10 would forget I was not just there to look at the pretty scenery again.

												The Pro's and cons + added comments on those leaving it a negative review.Pro's- The game is spectacularly stunning in places, the foliage itself isnt all that amazing but sheer quantity of it really help to make you feel like your in a primordial forest hunting for your dinner- Getting a killshot from any range is very satisfying - The Kill summary page is well thought out includes almost all information you'd want and is aesthetically really nice- Gunplay seems good, a little difficult as you dont have a shooting range but bullets are free so test away-Animals move and act realistically - Its not easy and that really is a pro, an easy hunting game isnt a hunting game, its an arcade game.- The missions as far as im aware are decent and offer the player plenty of opportunity to learn the basics of the game (even though the mechanics are barely explained)-Multiplayer is good it just needs more depth and fixing so its a bit more fluid getting in and out of games-progression speed and levelling seem balanced and cash flow also doesnt seem to be an issue - Variation of animals is good and the frequency at which you find them is also goodCONS- id like to start this section off by saying that these are menial issues, they arent game breaking, they dont make the game any less playable they are just tweaks that would make the game feel a lot more proper and less thrown together- The main con in this list is the fact you feel like a beta player, its not a case of oo this doesnt work its more a case of ♥♥♥♥ me surely this should be simpler or you'd think they would have explained that a little better- The menu's are poorly designed and feel like placeholders for a far more accurate model that was never made-The tutorial is basically non-existant (i think they expect you to get to level 3) and thats your tutorial over- The quantity of weapons seems rather small but thats easily fixed- The amount of time spent using each weapon to get its upgrade could be reduced as ive killed many things with my rifle and im not even close to the next one- a bit of logic wouldnt go miss in places, like why the next gun i unlock is of lower calibre when im already struggling with big game like bears-Some animals can be a little buggy such as getting caught on terrain or just generally freaking out-Also you give me a shotgun but no birds to shoot? i dont get it? yea i can kill vermin with it but ultimately if you got a shotgun, your killing birds!-The scoreboard and kill history are a bit ♥♥♥♥ as well, they need to completely remake those menu's so the player feels more proud of his kills, a review screen of the kill summary would be a fantastic way to look over previous kills and compare with a friend.- It has crashed on me once but im 14 hours in so it would be hardly fair to complain about crashes.-The level of sound you create is ridiculous it seems like there is only 3 options on how much noise can be made which to mean seems a little silly considering sprinting through a forest should be louder than crawling through bushes very slowly.OVERALL - In the games present state id say but it from cdkeys and save yourself the extra money because you are buying an unfinished product but that being said what you will get for the £20 is a fantastic hunting simulator with insane potential and an active helpful community. The fixes they need to implement are as follows - New (more proffessional) menu system with a more dynamic look at your own personal stats, Redone AI for broken animals such as the bear, simple sound fixes to stop music randomly cutting or animals calls not actually sounding out, they need to implement a whole firing range system that allows you to go and practice at various ranges and with various bullet types (for Free).They need to implement a full guided tutorial that explains everything because i myself had to do a tonne of guesswork. Finally what i will say is buy this game, it may not be finished but in a couple months in i believe the game will have had all issues fixed and more things adeed, its a fantastic game and if you let stupid things like a poor ui stop your from playing it then you should probably just delete steam.

												This is an exceptional hunting experience. The graphics in this game are truly breathtaking and the animations of the animals is detailed. This comes at the cost of performance but it is well worth upgrading your machine just to experience this game on ultra the vistas are jaw dropping.Theres a couple of clipping issues with some rare holes in the mesh where you can see under the terrain at the water plane. I ran into choppy audio but I've got a feeling this is my processor stuggling to keep up. The game seems to be taking up above 90 percent of my processors resources and my graphics card only has 2 gig of vram. To enjoy ultra textures you will need at least a 4gig card but it's well worth it. One thing i did notice though is when i shone my torch at the animal it didn't spook. I don't know if this happens maybe the animal freezes up in shock from the light. Maybe have it realistically reacting to torchlight is a feature you can add.Recommended!			"

												Review of the game as it is on 2017 March 12.First day when I bought it , it was amazing, played 7 hours straight , no crashes, encountered only one bug (animal stuck on trees). Was super hyped to play it more. The next day I played few hours and game started crashing. It wasn't too bad as I crashed few hours apart. The third day I couldn't play. Crashed almost instantly or after maximum of 10 minutes gameplay. I don't know if it's my computer problem or the game but as I played first day without any problems I hope it's the game and developers will fix it because I really love the game. Because of this it really sucks I can't play the game I payed 30€. Buy it with caution.			"

												Though I am not a very good hunter  I still played  the Hunter a fashionable number of hours and enjoyed it very much, even though it had some quirks  and features like micro sales which I find unpalatable but still  it is lush and immensely enjoyable . So when I saw Hunter cotw I thought it would be  a very nice game to buy  and it was at first . I started a new hunter  and learned the rules through the lush wood of Hirshfelden  and grew quite fond of it  then I discovered  problems and bugs such as the animal falling  when hit ,  then starting up  again which prevented me  from  total immersion  animals caught in the textures and keeping running  through, stationarily  but ok  every games has its quirk and I should not complain about it  but still ... This game has a great potential and  is far from reaching it  and Sadly it is embedded in its structure. You have no save... let me explain  You have 2 hunting  territories Leyton lake and Hirshfelden  and you can't  use the same build  of character in the other reservation  worse than that. You'll have to start again in the previous one if you start a new game I was utterly dismayed  when I discovered it . When you  launch a game if you  level up through it  you usually know that your character is going to  be with you even if you start a new one or in the case of The hunter  you don’t lose anything when you start another game. I hope that  I made my point and  would like expensive world to add this particular feature (which is a save mechanism) in order to make the game really enjoyable  and longer lasting. Please consider what I said before buying it It is not a bad game of itself but it is  quite limited Have a good gaming and see you for my next review.			"

												I never thought I'd see myself falling in love with a hunting game, but theHunter: Call of the Wild has its claws in me and I'm not mad about it. The thrill of the hunt is visceral. You have to rely on sight and sound in a way that few games pull off. Hunting with friends is even better than hunting alone. One person can post up while the other wrangles or lures the prey. It's just dripping with fun if you give yourself the time to get lost in its world. The maps are huge, beautiful, and varied, with plenty of nice set pieces to stumble upon.On the downside, the game is riddled with annoying bugs. Often they require a full restart, which is made worse by the fact that you can't simply back out to the main menu, you MUST quit to the desktop to exit the game. Ironsights will occasionally bug out, activating multiplayer quests will boot your friends from your game, animals will get stuck on geometry, netting you easy kills that cheapen the experience.All of that said, the gameplay is worth dealing with the bugs and it seems the devs are working hard to fix the problems.Pros:Gorgeous VisualsExcellent Sound DesignDamn Fun Gameplay!Cons:Bugs, bugs, bugs			"

												Dear Devs and All,  this is an engaging game.  The landscape, weather and environment are really very nice indeed.  It is however currently let down by several issues which affect gameplay and overall enjoyment which SHOULD NOT be in this post beta release.  Namely: you change the music settings to zero and yet it still plays loud music(!)  The interface is very ropey, more often than not clicking or pressing ''escape' on the keyboard to try and leave the interface (settings for example) does nothing >.< grrr.  Deer, indeed herds of deer, caught up running around in circles or up against the landscape ad infinitum.  Walking/squatting or kitten crawling seems to make little change to noise or animals awareness of you.  Gear is so expensive. But lastly the most annoying thing is, it takes ages, absolutely ages to get from one area to another... As has already been suggested - a tent or 'camp for the night' feature would make this all much more tolerable.Cheers!			"

												Very pretty game, intense hunting sequences broken up by a beautiful walking simulator. Unfortunately, it's totally broken. Purchased weapons don't show up in inventory, and I shuffled inventory on my hotbar and the game ate my roe deer caller for my troubles. The store indicates that it's ""owned"", but it's nowhere to be found in my inventory and can't be equipped. Same with the .223 rifle and jackrabbit caller I've purchased. Plus, the sound is buggy as hell. This one needs significant work before I can recommend it, but I really really hope they get it together because 90% of an awesome game is already there.			"

												Absolutely loving this game! I am not having any of the issues others have reported. I'm not having any backpack issues, store/storage issues, or not being able to escape out of menu issues. I do however have the issue of not being able to run the game in SLI yet. But that's not a deal breaker as it runs fine for me off of one GPU. Not 144hz fine but it's running at a steady 60fps fine, which isn't bad with G-sync turned on.As far as people complaining about not being able to escape from a menu, just click the map tab or any other tab to get out of settings and then hit Escape. Easy Peezy. Graphics are fantastic and the sound is pretty damn good as well. This game runs very nicely for the amount of detail in it. I am quite impressed. After reading so many negative reviews about bugs and such I was very skeptical going into this game. Well, maybe I'm just lucky. I have no idea, but I have been having a blast. No stuck animals yet either. Hell I tracked a bleading deer for about an hour and a half earlier. Would have been nice if it would have gotten stuck :)I would recommend this game for it's current price of $30. Oh and don't let my hours in game fool you. I have been playing quite a bit on my shared account as well.No graphical glitches on my end either.System specs for reference:i7-5820k @4.7Ghz2x Titan X SLI (Maxwell), can only use one card at the momentResolution: 2560x1440 @144hz32Gb 2400mhz RAMAMD systems may be the ones with most of the problems? I have no idea as I don't see specs in most of these reviews and I haven't tried playing this on one of my AMD GPU builds yet.			"

												I see alot mixed comments about this game. Has some bugs yes but not to bad, just launched so not to surpised. Graphics/Map. 12/10. The map is perfect. Allthough the placed deer stands and such, could have been placed better. Animals act pretty good. There is room for improvment, example. you fire of couple rounds the other animals are likely to come back after some time. Not likely in real life. The game needs more stuff added yes, Placable deer stands a big need! more scents, gun, Season added etc. For the money it is well wourth it. And with them having alot of stuff in there previous game free to play. I'm sure they will add plenty later on when they get the bugs out. Far as performance No issues at all runing the game. I am runing a 1080 Strix though Lower older card may have issue unsure. Been along time since I saw a huntting game wourth my time like 13 years long or longer. I gave it a shoot, And glad I did. I look forward to seeing how the expand to this game, The map just WoW all I can say! Best map ive seen in a game since I can remeber. I hihjly recomending Supporting this game. I'm not a big hunter fan And I love it. There things that could be improved like trophy seeing or bragging rights if you will. But for the money well wourth it..			"

												10/10 would track a black bear for an hour and lose it again This game is great. First off, you need certain traits to be able to properly enjoy this game, and most of all, you need certain specs to be able to run the game to its full capacity  to even be able to properly enjoy it the way it is supposed to be enjoyed/played. Right now, there are a couple glitches I've encountered within the game, but nothing worth writing a bad review over or even mentioning. This game is visually, one of the most beautiful games that I've ever played. The sounds of the forest, the rain, the sounds of the rifle, everything visually and auditory is breathtakingly beautiful.You can go an hour following tracks, and end up with nothing or a missed shot.. or you can see two black bears and two coyotes within an hour. It's hit and miss and makes for a great thrill when you finally find the prey you've been tracking. Overall, this is a great game with very minor glitches that don't change the game in the slightest. I definitely recommend buying this if you have the patience to endure it. It's totally worth it.			"

												I will keep this simple and straight to the point, they say this is a fully playable release, it is not.The game crashes constantly, too many bugs to count off, and I mean game breaking bugs, walk into a tree, die, animals disappear, some even invisible, scope bugs, where you cannot use your scope at all, kind of bugs.Do not be decieved and fooled to buy this game, it looks nice, but underneath the nice plsatic advertisement wrap is a steaming pile of broken ♥♥♥♥ that they tried to pass off as a ""fast-track Alpha game"". This game should have been advertised as still in Alpha, and sold and advertised as such.I emplore you, do not buy this game, it is bad, bad in a broken, cannot play kind of way.I deeply regret buying this, the hours I spent stalking animals to not be able to claim them, follow them after they have been hit because of tracking bugs, and game crashing after you slaughter a herd of elk from long range, only to have all that time spent stalking and killing every last one, lost, because of a stinking crash.Be warned, be wary, and do research about the game you want to buy and play before buying.

												After 3 hours of playing i can say its a really great hunting game Are there bugs? yes most games out there have some bugs but the are fixing it ok :)  and if you shose not to buy because of that you gonna lose somting great when it comes to hunting game.Open world and scenery is beautiful i say just wow i run on ultra and high play around and find your sweet spot in the settings and give this game a chans. and remeber this is not thehunter classic yes the share some simular key features between them but this is a new game and veteran Classic players gonna feel at home :) Pros:  Open worldGorgeous graphicsGood tutorial and hint for new huntersNo licenses for animals, No pay to play for those that dont like thatand yes you can jump now i did missing that in classicProgression system is really nice with the xp and money and weapon skill thats how you become good in the game.You can run around for hours and just look with out hunting if so, and more Cons:  yes there are some bugs but the are fixing it thats great :)  tracking in game is  confusing first time you try it out but you learn how it works. small graphic errors/lag only have 1 so far but there are not much i can say that are bad about this game yes the are ppl that have some crash and bugs and erros but let them work even GTA 5 did have bugs from start those that give a bad review because of that thats worng in my opinion.

												It just doesn't make sense to have an amazing looking game crash, and have this bad of a menu system. Here is the break down:The game is beautiful graphics wise when you crank it up to Ultra everything but when there are so many bugs it becomes unplayable.There is only one player profile across the board. What you do online is the same as if you play solo mode. (example: I dropped a gun online, it was gone in single player as well. (I create a New Game, it just resets my spawn point of my other game but I have same items skills etc...)The Menus are just a developers nightmear. They never work and 50% of the game you have to move in and out of the menus to change guns, ammo etc... I found myself using my arrow keys and enter key to navigate, and that only works like 70% of the time, but a little better then clicking with a mouse. MENU SYSTEM MUST BE WORKED ON before you buy!There is no leaving a game! Thats right, you can't leave a single player game or a online player game and go directly back to the main menu... You Exit to desktop every time! So if i am playing single player, and my firend gets online and is like join my game... I have to exit the entire game to re-launch it then go to multi player. Multiplayer is a bit buggy, There lag system is broken. Peer to Peer style play. I was just about to bag a nice buck and bam the host left the game, Here is the kicker, The entire game shuts down, Not a crash it ♥♥♥♥ing shuts down?!?! No ♥♥♥♥s where given!Deer and animals get stuck in rocks and ♥♥♥♥ all the time.Single player is way to easy to play, every second there is a sound from an animal or a trailMutliplayer is much more..... its a bit real, animals are harder to find and you need your actual skills to find ♥♥♥♥. I'm not trying to bash this game its just not finnished, its more of a beta then a final game. Don't get me wrong, the game has its ups which would be graphics, I've never seen a deer hunter game look so great in my life. Till the game gets patched with the bugs and suggestions I made above... Its a hard hard pass.			"

												With hundreds and hundreds of hours in the original I was a bit skepitcal about this at first. Glad I a took the plunge.It has THE best natural landscapes in any game I have played, as well as the BEST realistic looking lighting I have ever seen in any game ever. Even the way the forest is constructed looks incredibly accurate down to the stages of plant growth and variety. Top marks for that.The animals look and move MUCH more realistically then the original game, Although I have heard reports of terrible pathfinding from the AI and have wittnessed this myself on a few occasions, The most memorable was cornering an entire heard of fallow deer in a nook in a cliff face, all the deer ran in circles I moved in and just sat there shooting at them untill I had about all 8 of them down, it was figurativly shooting fish in a barrel. Only a few times have I seen other pathfinding fails. Mostly they run into rocks and spaz out. This doesn't really bother me as it doesn't happen too often.I have only seen 2 graphical glitches both are minor and not really worth mentioning.The ONLY BUG so far to cause me trouble is with the ammuntition, It takes rifle skill points to unlock different types of ammo, I have unlocked the .270 rifle and saved up and bought it, the ammo was unlocked with the rifle But when I go to buy the ammo it still say locked and won't let me get it... the rifle cant be used without it.I am totally happy with this game and how this series is progressing, PROVIDING this minor and major bugs are fixed reasonably quickly. It also shows my need to upgrade my aging GTX780 as High settings are about as good as I can go and get reasonable framerate.			"

												I am truly disappointed in this game so far. Looks so amazing yet the amount of bugs tells me they rushed to release. Not to mention the horrible gui. For gods sake get rid of that annoying beep while navigating the menu. Besides the game not being playable for me (buggy, not a system spec problem). While as visually appealing as it is. They have missed the mark. The entire experience is dulled by the Gui, and lack of customization. You start the game with no idea what to do. For me I was unable to see tracks at all until I installed on my other pc and then I was finally able to see the tracks glow. Then that quit working on that pc.  Sigh's after about 5hrs of gameplay I still have not found out how to buy weapons or change camo. Maybe part of this is because of my inability to play properly due to bugs. effects not working invincible animals etc.Or maybe just because the game has no proper gui and seems half done. If the dev's would read this then I would note that personally I love ""The Hunter Classic"" and have poored a large chunk of money into it.  So please, bring back ALL the things that made the original great...Things like the huntermate beeing used to track. An intuitive menu that allows for quick and easy access to all equiptment and customizations. All the amazing hunting types. Turkey, ducks, etc. With all that said, I think the reason I am so disappointed is because I feel very pationate about this game. I was hoping for at least what I was able to get from the original. Then after the failure of primal. I purchase a third installment and once again feel let down. Now at the game's current state I would not recommend this at all. Maybe a year down the road they may be able to get this working. Although so far they cant even get primal to save the game. So, yah for me you guys have close to $300 from me. I am am not likely to buy anything else unless I see some serious improvements in the direction of your games.			"

												I like it. I haven't played many other hunting games before but this game is pretty good. It has just been released so there is bound to be some patching that needs to be done. Animals might get stuck on a rock in rare cases or the sound when you sneak is louder than it should be (This is already fixed). The multiplayer is pretty good too, the large maps can let you have several friends and still be able to hunt by yourself. 8/10			"

												This game is absolutely gorgeous. Everything about this game excited me from the first time I saw it. Coming from the original theHunter, this is a breath of fresh air. No subscriptions. No penalties for wrong caliber. This is really an open-world hunting experience that can be sort of mission based if you choose, or not. Pros: Graphics, Animals, Realism, Map, ""Noccys"" (Binoculars).Cons:Bugs, Glitchy Animal AI, No ""Back to Main Menu"" Option.I feel that at this price point, this game is a steal. 30$ may seem steep, but AAA titles like Madden and FIFA release the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game every year, riddled with microransactions and ways for them to make money... ON TOP OF A 60$ PRICE TAG. This game is worth the money, and with a few patches, it can definitely become a great game. Have patience: not only in the game hunting a bear, but with the development team on patching bugs.			"

												The game is a huge upgrade from the original ""theHunter"". They turned the game from a pseudo pay-to-win simulator into a grinding game that makes you want to keep playing. The visuals are absolutely stunning and the general gameplay got oh so very polished.On a side note there are still quite a few bugs here and there, while not gamebreaking they are still a pain and will hopefully be fixed as soon as possible.All in all for a 30€ game, if you are a fan of hunting, I would definitely recommend this gem.

But the bugs I've encounterd has only been minor and simple workarounds will do for now. The game is exremely beautiful, the hunting is fun and sounds are creating a great immersion. The devs are active and working on fixing bugs, 1.2 came out a few days after launch which seams like a good sign that they are working hard.			"

												I'm an avid player of theHunter and was excited for this release, but I have to warn everyone to NOT BUY THIS! In its current state it's completely broken. There are dozens of glaring bugs which cause crashes, inability to join friends in multiplayer, animals glitching into terrain, the server browser not working correctly and many more issues.On top of that there are issues which are just terrible design and should be patched out immediately. There is no option of exiting a single player/multiplayer game to the main menu, you have to quit to desktop and reboot the game. The Lake District map is literally crawling with deer, it's like a shooting range. Animals don't appear to react to gunfire unless they've been hit with a bullet, you can shoot 6 deer without the others in the herd caring.Wait and see if they fix the game with patches before considering purchasing this.

												Hi all!i just want to write a quick review about the game. i play the game every day no crash issue at all graphic is awsome it's running on high and ultra settings as well whitout any problem i use high settings. Cpu: amd 8350 fx black edition 8 core, Gpu: XFX ATI 7970 3 GB, Memory: 16 GB G-Skill 1860 mhz No problems on running nice and smooth. the xp gain is all right im lvl 13 now the money as well i collected 80000 all ready after 3 days i think is good enough. Rifle score i like it because it's no easy and i can't unlock all the items after one day gameing. Sounds rabbites are too loud rain as well and sometimes just stack i know in next patch will be fixed. Animal groups i think have no any problem with that the game is not boring and if you have a look in the real life you will see the same 10 or even more animals in group i like it. All together i recommend for eveyone who like hunting it is not an FPS game where you kill everything what is moving on your screen Then this game is not for you. Bigger trophy more xp,money and rifle score as well and don't forget the distance longer shoot mor point. Finaly yes worthy to buy good job devs keep up the bug fixings i love the game.			"

												Alright the game has been out for just under a week and i already have >20 hours time played.  This is a great follow up theHunter original - i would say if you enjoyed that game and your computer can handle the new engine then you will also enjoy Call of the Wild.  The environment and graphics are incredible.  The sound stage is great.  The improvments to draw distance were so needed and really breathe new life into Call of the Wild (draw distance was why i stopped playing the original game).  Overall there are a few glitchy things but i think the devs still deserve credit for a solid release.  Reading through some of the other reviews and discussions i think some people are definitely blowing the issues out of proportion.  I can recall a number of AAA titles with a $60 price tag in the last year that have had far far far worse bugs (i.e. AAA titles with actual game breaking bugs: falling through maps, blue screen of death, etc.) and i have not experienced anything even remotely close to that magnitude with theHunter.  There are a few hiccups in the menus (both start and in game).  The animal UI is suitable for now but also has some opportunities around movement patterns, behavior on steep terrain, and fleeing.Sure, there are a couple of things that need to be ironed out but the potential is CLEARLY here.  I have already gotten more than $30 of enjoyment out of the game over the first weekend.  I'd love to see some refinement to the bow hunting in the future, some additional stat tracking, and the inclusion of ATVs for getting around faster than walking.			"

												This is one of the most immersive buetiful games i have ever played, Its almost photo realistic walking through these gorgous maps. Hunting animals is fun but its very very slow paced. The devs were aiming for a realistic hunting expierance. If you are the impatient type or play alot of call of duty this game wont be for you. Don't be steered wrong by the negative reviews, Yes there are some really bad bugs but its far from game breaking and im sure they will iron them out soon.  Also be careful with alot of these negative reviews. Apperently they made another call of the wild a few years ago with a cash shop and people that have invested hundreds of dollars into that old game ARE ♥♥♥♥♥♥ OFF They can't carry any progress over here, They are mad so they are slandering the game. If you watched the trailers of this and seem interested BUY IT! Its that good that you will overlook the bugs.			"

												After playing theHunter classic for over 300 hours I was excited to try CotW. Let me begin by saying that the current state of the game is that it feels unfinished. A few more weeks of testing and bug fixing was not a bad idea.So expect things  like ui not working, game crashing, sounds sometimes not playing when they should. Game mechanics not working,animals getting stuck...that sort of thing.However, I feel this game has great potential to be a very immersive and beautiful (the graphics look fantastic) hunting simulator. The sim aspects are familiar If you have played theHunter classic ,you will know how it works. It's basically the same,stay downwind, dont make too much noise and hear the animal call to llocate it.I had some good fun hunting but the game definitly needs more work and lets hope the devs are up to it. If they manage to sort out the bugs this could be a great game			"

												This is a working progress review. My first time playing a hunter game as my old potato laptop couldnt run the old hunter game. I have to say this game is really good so far. Ive only really hunted deer and foxes so far mind you.Pros: 1). The Graphics are amazing in this game from the scenary to the wildlife.2). The reserves are brilliantly done and are huge in scale.3). Sounds are brilliant also, from the natural ambience to the gun sounds. Everything that makes a noise in this game sounds like it should.4). The wildlife that are in the game look amazing (although thier eyes look wierd up close).5). Really nice weapon models.6). Single player and multiplayer/co-op.Cons:1). AI sometimes bugs out and gets stuck on things. And some of the animations aren't very fluid ect, when the bear stands up, it sort of telleports upright.2). After you fire your weapon sometimes your rifles scope bugs out. (not sure how to explain it).3). There's a few animals in the game you can kill but get nothing for, like rabbits and squirils.4). No trophy system (Yet).5). No leaderboards.6). Needs real bows not just crappy compound ones. And more rifles of different calibers.7). Should be more customization options for you character to make your clothing unique.8). Tons of bugs ranging from your guns going invisible and not being able to look down you scope without it being at a angle so you can see anything through it, to your game crashing alot (mines only started crashing after 15 hours playtime mind you).9). Not being able to collect your own trophies in a multiplayer session sometimes, although if you have friends you play with they can do it for you.So far ill give this a 7/10 and hope they add more animals to hunt and stuff to hunt with and mybe the option to build a hunting station where ever we want not just pre determined places. Once they fix the crashes at least i will have no problem giving it a higher score as i can live with bugs after playing arma 3 for so long.			"
