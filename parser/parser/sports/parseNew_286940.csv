												Never played this game but steam say that I actually did so instead of judging the game here's a cool way to make skinny guacamoles with homemade baked tortilla chips :Skinny Guacamole:2 medium green sweet peppers2 medium fresh poblano chile peppers1 bulb garlic1/2 teaspoon olive oil2 roma tomatoes, seeded and chopped1 serrano pepper, minced2 medium ripe avocados, halved, seeded, peeled, and diced1 teaspoon lime zest2 tablespoons lime juice1/2 teaspoon saltBaked Tortilla Chips:Corn tortillasOlive oil spraySaltFor the guacamole:Preheat oven to 425° F. Line a 15 x 10 x 1-inch baking pan with foil; set aside. Quarter, stem, and seed the peppers. Place pepper quarters, cut sides down, in the prepared pan. Cut off the top half inch of the garlic bulb to expose ends of individual cloves. Leaving garlic bulb whole, remove any loose, papery outer layers. Place bulb, cut end up, on a double thickness of foil. Drizzle with the oil. Bring foil up around bulb and fold edges together to loosely enclose. Place foil packet on the pan with the peppers.Roast peppers and garlic for 20 to 30 minutes or until pepper skins are charred and garlic cloves feel soft. Allow to cool about 15 minutes. When garlic head is cool enough to handle, squeeze garlic paste out of the individual cloves.In a food processor combine roasted pepper quarters and the garlic paste. Cover and pulse until combined, but still slightly chunky.In a large bowl, combine tomatoes and serrano pepper. Add roasted pepper and garlic combination and stir to combine. Add diced avocado, lime zest, lime juice, and salt. Gently toss to combine.Serve immediately or cover the surface with plastic wrap and chill for up to 1 hour.For the chips:Cut corn tortillas into wedges and place on a foil-lined baking sheet. Spray lightly with olive oil spray and season with salt, to taste.Bake in a 350° F oven for 8-10 minutes or until lightly golden brown.			"

												I have played FPS games for many years, and still belong to an online clan, and we have a lot of fun.This game is good to a degree, but that is where it stops.If you know Gameforge you will know they own Tera the MMO a game that is amazing, but they decided to just screw the whole game up IMO they should have left it as it was , they also do loads of mobile games, so alot of there money comes from that also.Sadly it is the same with this it is a huge money making machine.Dont get me wrong companies have to make money we all know that, but it's the way it is done.lets shorten this OK, so pro's first.Pro's: 1) Very much like C,O.D. 2) Maps are not huge which is nice, so a real good run, and gun.3) Have your TDM, explosive, also Hero which is an alien type, and manhunt, also party for funshoot the glass and c who wins :).Sniper mode is in ther e as well, as is HC to a degree.4) Nice selection of guns, all with different sounds.5)good graphics, and fluid gameplay.Cons:1) You have to repair your guns which cost you ingame money, or you can pay £10 for 30days, and they will give you 2 nice chrome ones which you dont have to repair, but all others you buy you will have to repair :(.2) Camo you have to buy with real money, parts of uniforms again will cost you real money.It so SAD, as most of the stuff only last for 1day, 7 days, or 30 days.3) If you want to be a woman it will cost you nearly £50, and outfit called Black mamba.Gameforge should be done for being sexist, just for this.4)There are only two HC maps in the game, and I love playing HC, so this is a real let down, all maps should have been HC, it's a pain trying to kill someone witth a whole clip sometimes in soft core mode.5) Smoke grenade will cost you 2000 sp (ingame money) or pay with real money which will cost you £5 !!!!, flame grenade's are the same as well.6)The killcam is way off, and they should fix it, as most times it looks, as tho they have not hit you.7) bullet penetration has not been done well at all, fire at someone, and chances are he will turn, and just kill you, as tho you have not hit him at all.8) in COD you can play around with sights atc on the guns, but in this you cannot.If a gun comes with a sight you are stuck with it.9) There does not seem to be any mode for guns like single fire, and full like in COD.10) Info given on guns is useless just give damage accuracy, but would be nice of them to let us know about auto snipersetc.There is a load more wrong with this game not just the money machine.All I can say is try it for a while, and make your own mind up.I paid £10 for a month just to see the differnce between F2P, and P2W.It seems that if you pay all your weapons get + 5% more firepower, and -5% recoil which does make a differnce, and in my book is wrong of the company to do this.

												Before reading this review please check that I do have 2k hours playing it.This game suffers a lot from their publisher, Gameforge. As it is they milk their community as they can.Every month Cash only weapons are added to the lotery ( capsules) which are significantly better than the ""free"" (ingame currency) versions.These are capsules that used to have a 100 capsules accumulation limit. Once you spent about 50 euros (!) you were sure that that weapon would be yours. Now they remove it - you can actually spend hundreds of euros without having a item that you want.They charge you 75 euros for a +100% exp char 25 euros for a lucky point Tshirt or zombie mask to help you getting extra exp to level up. Yes your heard right.One could think that with all that money they would have a good game. But no.The sheer amount of hackers is insane. I did last week clanwars (cw's) where i couldnt find another clan without hacks. Many have their cheats hidden and once they start loosing the war they start killing you from their spawn or behind walls.The cheating sites actually have happyhours for this game where they offer the cheats for free for the weekend.Why?Because gameforge insist on using Xigncode who anyone in this community know is a very bad anticheat. They also refused to implement VAC as their anticheat,even tho XIGNCODE is beeing replaced everywhere in any game due to be so easy to bypass.Everytime they make a maintenance no one knows when the servers will be back up - that's how competents and professionals they are.10/10 Is beeing runned by money hungry people with absolut no respect for their gaming community.

												Hackers. (Saw a guy cheating on Monday, same guy came three days later and was doing the same thing; which means he didn't get banned or punished in any form or fashion)Not noob friendly. (♥♥♥♥♥♥ match-making, most hackers are in the low level servers as well)P2W (Pay to win) trash of a game. (at its current state)Installed it a few times over the years, every time ended up uninstalling and forgetting about it few minutes after. There are a lot of better games out there, and a lot of people are noticing that (player base dropping rapidly)Can't recommend it untill the DEVs make some changes (which they won't cause they're hungry for that sweet $$)Just skip this one and browse the Store for something else.P.S- I've played this game outside of Steam for many hours, don't look at the play time on here when judging my review.This is my opinion, respect it and don't talk♥♥♥♥♥♥about it.

												I'll go over the advertising to clarify:>>Over 20 maps covering a wide range of locales, spanning everything from deserts through to winter landscapes. True, but every one of these maps is tiny and you'll spawn facing the enemy team, so most of the time, you'll live 10 seconds at best. The map design is by far the worst point of this garbage game.>>Cool weapons to suit every playing style – from pistols through to heavy machine guns. If it weren't for the terrible gun handling, that might be interesting. But the game is mostly spray & pray.>>A plethora of options to change the appearance of your character and weapons. If you got a bucket load of money, that is. Also, items directly influence combat and 75%  of the store has a premium sign.What they don't tell you is:a) horribly outdated graphics. UE3 can do much better.b) really bad client. You'll get popups asking yes or no without knowing what for, the menu is cluttered and it will pop in and out as it sees fitting.c) ZERO feedback. Could be a grenade, could be a giraffe, you don't get a difference. Also, people will gun you down randomly while sprinting because bullets just find their own way of travelling, no need for ballistic physics.If you really MUST play this, just use the pile of credits you get from the start, buy the M14 and shoot people straight, you can get 3-4 kills in a row just spamming the trigger. After than, you're not getting much credits so at least this 30 minutes will be fun.I have now seen the ""unique hero mode"". It's a blunt and trashy MOBA mode with so many problems a list wouldn't even fit in here. The number one issue in MOBAs are people leaving. Actual MOBA games tackle this issue with massive punishments for leaving. This game offers premium to prevent this punishment. Nuff said.			"

												Probably the best Free 2 Play Shooter i ever played.Stunning anmount of Game-Mods for every kind of player.If you want to go competetive you are free to go from the very beginning, this game bears very little so called 'casher advantages' which are not allowed to use in Leagues and Tournaments anyway.Pros:-very active community -awesome game experience for competetive gamers and casual freetime shooter-active clanwar and public rooms-friendly and kinda fast support -developer communicates with the players and actually takes advice-leveling system which allows you to make progress in form of statistics and other stuff-you dont have to level to be succsessfullCons:-you have a few cheater 'like in any other game' -clanwarsystems depends on people actually wanting to play against you [if you or your team is too good, chances are you do not find clanwars that often.] - the esl.eu Versus and Cups make this not a big con though.-hitreg sometimes feels just wrong-peekadvantage is given-if you intend to go competetive i recommand you to download the game over GameforgeLauncher instead of Steam since ESL Wire is not that compatible and will cause a lot of issues, if you manage to get it running.-even though the game itself has a matchmaking system which should be in the PRO list, people do not use it since they want to avoid a lose			"

												Skill SF2 is a P2A (Pay to Aim) FPS game which is also full of hackers and tocix players (like in any other FPS game).Most hackers will claim they are ESL players and most Clans in-game are filled with any kind of hack. Anti-hack shield is a joke which will most likely detect your TS client as a forbidden program and shut down the game, maybe block the game from starting again. (True story, i had to contact the Korean team that developed the shield and get no result of course!). It is not a game to play and have fun with random people, BUT it is a game to play and have fun with friends! You don't have to pay to play it...you just pay to aim or tog et EXP - SP faster. Overall it is another Gameforge game (surprised it is still online), that has close to no possibility of evolving and the swarms of hackers will continue to pollute the game for at least 10 more years, until the game goes offline or changes ""hands"".P.S. Don't count my hours on steam for this game. I was a Closed Beta player (August 2013), spent way too much time in game creating new accounts to play on the low levels cause on high levels everything was ""instant"". Too bad steam does not allow you to create multi accounts in Skill :(			"

												All in all a decent FPS - 7/10If you're looking for a F2P FPS, definitely consider giving this game a go.At first I thought it was another one of those CrossFire/Combat Arms games; you know the ones, where you pay a stupid amount of money to RENT a gun for like 3 days? This IS one of those games - there is gun renting, HOWEVER.The prices for permanent weapons or accesories are very very reasonable. As soon as you start playing, you'll have enough (30 000) SP (game currency, not real money) to buy a permanent weapon and should be able to scrap enough for another by the time you reach 6. Most weapons are between 15 000 to 30 000. I, personally, got an MG, for the insane ROF and DMG, and surprisingly low recoil. Well, that and I absolutely love to see people cry over the MG every single time you kill them.I have no problems with the graphics (even though the menu is sort of low quality). I remember camping in this small shed, covering this teammate who was sniping. I was looking in his direction, standing by him, when all of a sudden his head blows up, covering my screen completely with blood for 5 seconds or so. Instantly contracted PTSD. This is, of course, praising and not scolding.Every day or so, you can get a free item (pick 1 card out of 3, get a random item that increases your stats such as speed, armor or even cash gained) for anything between 24 hours to 7 days.I was surprised by the amount of Game Modes the game has. Other than the classic TDM, S&D, FFA and Domination Game Modes, there's the Hero one (basically a MOBA, pretty unique but didn't really get the hang of it), Convoy (basically Payload (with a twist?)), PvE Zombie Survival, Manhunt (one side weird mutants, other soldiers), good old Hardcore, the fun-packed Party and many more.Is it a P2W? Well, not really.You can become a VIP for 30 days for 99 Cash (another IG currency, 60 Cash is 5 dollars...), which lets you get SP and EXP much faster (though you can just buy boosts for less Cash), 2 chrome skin weapons with 5% more fire power, and 5% less recoil, and instant respawning. You be the judge if that's P2W, obviously is not for me. You can also buy other skins for Cash (roughly 35 Cash for 30 days of.. skin time?), which are purely cosmetic and do not give you any advantages over other non-skin players and characters which give you more EXP and SP while playing with them, ranging anywhere between 49 and even 999 Cash!tl;drPROS  fun gunplay decent graphics rather cheap permanent weapons loads of game modes F2P, not P2W barely any hackers has a (good?) tutorial and a map where you can spawn your own bots rookie servers where you can play with other beginners, though not for long as you can only stay there as long as your K/D is under 1.2, or until you're Sergeant Major (20+ Rank)CONS  every time I launch the game, I must rush into the tutorial or a normal game, because my FPS launches up into a thousand, despite having V-Sync on. Entering a game fixes it really weird low-quality menu, despite the game looking decent gun and accessory rentingWill update if I come across anything else I like/dislike about the game.			"

												S.K.I.L.L. - Special Force 2Rate: 5/10Pretty good game with a solid gameplay and alot of guns. The maps are great and for sniper lovers it's good.Now why do I give a even rate for this game despite it's great potential.This is f2p game and as we know, when a game is consider a f2p it needs some kind of store or real money strategy to actually gain some income. So as I suspected and my knowledge from previous f2p FPS games, this game includes a store for purchasing weapons and skins. But there is one thing that ruins this game, for me at least, S.K.I.L.L. has a VIP system that is based on a leveling process that when you buy VIP, everyday you will get points depending on the duration of your VIP and then your VIP level will increase and will decrease when you don't have VIP.Now you say well thats great, you get stuff unlocked from the store that is VIP restricted and also some pretty usefull bonuses. Well thats what makes this game fall in to the p2w category. The bonus you get from the VIP are bonus damage and recoil reduction, I believe it around 5% at least at level 1 VIP. The weapons are stronger than the normal weapons, the ones you buy with SP and VIP weapons don't need to be repaired.Also you don't get SP(in-game money) for every match that you win or lose, you will get a small percentage to fill up a bar and when it reaches to 100% it will give you a set amount of SP, but by the time you get another 100% you need to repair your weapons and reaparing weapons is really expensive, so basically you are stuck with low SP for a long time. So my advise is to at least give it a try and if you have money to spare and waste in this game, go on you will get a pretty decent content with VIP. Overall this game is p2w and for me it's a NO.

But the game has to many issues and hackers.For example: When you get killed by a sniper and watch the killcam you can see the shot like a meter next to you and still youre dead..Also the holosight is so ugly, it covers your entire screen..They need to fix  a lot in the game.On the + side it has a clanwar channel system. Which i love. IF anyone knows a game that has that aswell please notify me.But for new players looking for a nice basic F2P shooter i would say: Warface.			"

												I know most MMOFPS are pay 2 win, and I've played lots of them, but only in this game that p2w factor made me quit after 2 hours of playing. The game itself has amazing graphics, the controls feel good, etc...The thing that made me quit is, other games are p2w, but you don't feel that $$ only weapons are that overpowered, it's still manageable to win vs a guy that has $$ items using regular in-game money items. But what happened to me in all, and I repeat, all, the matches over this time is that my UMP and my M4 that I bought with my in game money, took 20/30 bullets to kill a guy, hitting his chest, then I die, check the killcam, and see a fancy gun, that can only be bought for cash, kill me with 5 shots to my feet. This repeats, all over again, with minor variations. It got so ridiculous to the point where a enemy is afk on spawn, I let this spawnprotection expire, aim at his head, fire 15 bullets, get hitmarkers in all, and he still stands alive. Overall, this game would be strongly recommended if it wasn't for this so heavy p2w factor, but still, if you are a kid that wants graphics in a game, and doesn't mid getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥hard by a bunch of guys that paid for a fancy weapon, this is the game for you!

												First of all, I have played this game since the beta (about 1k hours in total) so ignore my steam hours.This game is really good for a free FPS, it's really fast paced and lots of fun.I started playing this after my AVA career which lasted for 3 or 4 years, until the game died completely. This game was a lot different so it took some time to learn all the tricks and stuff like that, but once I kinda learned how to play it, it became so much fun. This game has all the game modes you need for a FPS game; Team Deathmatch, Free-For-All, Demolition/Blasting (Plant bomb/Defuse bomb) and couple of others like Snowball fight, Hexa (Fighting in a glass arena) and Seizure, which is basically Capture the Flag.I personally don't play too much TDM, FFA or Seizure, or any other ''casual'' game modes, I mainly focus on the Blasting because it's played on the tournaments and is the most competitive mode.TDM is good tho, for training aim and such.Seizure is just some casual fun.FFA is same thing as TDM, but without a team.Weapons in this game are pretty balanced, but there is some exceptions. Some of the SMGs are really trash, you can't do anything with their short range and bad accuracy.All rifles are usable, but there are few rifles picked up by the pros that are considered the best ones in the game (When I was playing this game in ESL tournaments, the best rifles were HK417, M4A1, K2 and Famas).Snipers are really powerful in this game, there are few snipers in the game, but only 3 of them are used by the pros, CheyTac M200, AWP and CZ 700. These are all bolt action snipers, and the semi-autos are pretty useless.This game also has a capsule shop, where you can try to win some overpowered guns with real money. They are pretty good in public games, and casual players seem to fancy them for their good accuracy and damage. But they are banned in the ESL league, so if you want to be good in this game, just don't bother trying to win those guns and learn to use the basic weapons.Community in this game is pretty much the same as in every other FPS game. There are some annoying people and some really great people. You will get called a noob/hacker/cheater/macro/lucker countless times in public games, so just deal with it. In the competitive scene players are respectful and really cool guys in general, so if you can't handle the kids in public games, create a team and start scrimming with other teams.And for those who want to join the competitive scene, ESL is hosting GO4Skill cup every weekend. So just pull together a team, and join.Overall I would give this game a 9/10, it is a really good free FPS game, and has potential to become really big.Had a lot fun in tournaments, so thanks for that to everyone in the scene.

												Let me tell you this now; I got at least 15 min of fun from this despite it being... well itself I guess you could say...While this game is free I prefered the 10 minutes of watching youtube while it was downloading than actually playing the game. When I first started the game I was instantly bombarded with notifications of item recieved, while thats not particularly bad seeing as it is more free stuff I was instantly confused. From why the game was bordered and there was no option to make it fullscreen along with the descriptions of the menu options just flashed, as it almost instantaneously stopped and it took me a second of exploring to tell what was going on. I rather liked how most cosmetic options I liked was purchasable with the in game currency which I was given over 30,000 of in the start I'm assuming which is for a weapon purchase. When messing with the options I found that the preview for the maximum graphics looked pretty good, I then got in game and found that it looked utterly terrible when compared to what I was expecting. I then proceded to get one-shot multiple times from a sniper rifle with some of them shooting two feet behind me and hitting but ended up winning with a positive K/D ratio feeling rather disappointed and decided to try a different game mode. To my surprise I got put into a payload type mode and enjoyed the first half; then it turned into sniper central getting one-shot left and right proceeding to pick one up off an enemy and going on a 5 killstreak before getting oneshot again.Overall I was going into this without much expectation and came out with even less. I would not recommend playing this unless you are absolutly bored and have nothing better to do.			"

												Nice remake of Soldier Front (it's the same DragonFly series)The game isn't really "" Pay to win ""It still requires 'skill' to get kills. Tho some paid stuff (tomahawk, hammers) can be useful sometimes.You can compare the game the most with ""Soldier Front 2"" from Aeriagames.The big difference with these other versions is the support. GameForge has enough staff to keep this game up to date, respond to your tickets in less than 24 hours etc.GameForge also updates the game on regular basis: meaning new maps, modes, guns etc.This makes the game more dynamic than eg. CoD.Even tho it's a F2P game and there are many things you can buy in-game, GameForge tries to keep the game reasonable for non-paying users. By leveling up and unlocking achievements you earn enough in-game money to buy you a nice arsenal of guns.For more screenshots / gamemodes / guns / info visit https://skill.gameforge.comYou'll also find the GameForge launcher there## DOWNLOADING THE GAMEBenefits of downloading the game via steam+ faster than via GF servers+ automatic updates (if enabled in your client)+ steam in-game overlay so you can browse facebook/google stuff while you're dead ;)Downside of downloading the game via steam- you can't (yet) login to your GameForge accountps: I've played both SF1, SF2 and SKILL. I have a couple thousand hours on record.			"

												I  personally hate reading long reviews so im gonna keep it short (last part was kinda what my dad said)  well its free and makes fun. The graphics are on a pretty high level and the game mechanics are goodThe anoying things about S.K.I.L.L  are that there are those dots in between the letters skill and all those kiddies buying expensive vip stuff (skins, grenades, weapons). Its not pay to win (you can still wreck them with a little bit of shooter experience) but it still sucks seeing all those shiny skins and guns no beeing able to buy them.			"

												I've been playing this game for quite some time now (I used to play it before it was on steam). Although the game has its disadvantages, it still truly is a remarkable FREE to play game. I capitalise 'FREE' because everyone expects the game to be 100% perfect. The 'Hero Mode' pretty much makes the game. It's really fun to play with a coordinated team. It's pretty much League of Legends but in first person... and with pimp guns!Q: Are there hackers in the game:A: Yes there are hackers BUT they're not frequent. Everyone is friendly and contributes to the ban/kick of the hacker. Q: Is this game Pay2Win?A: Although many people claim it is Pay2Win, It really isn't haha. Every 'paid' weapon is exactly the same as every normal weapon except it may have a shiny texture e.g. Gold or Chrome. These guns don't have any advantage over the normal ones. They are simply there for 'bling'. Character models may give you an XP and SP increase but you get what you pay for, right?. Pay2Win Level: 2/10. (I give it a two only because I like the cool looking guns and wish I had them)One problem that annoys me: It's quite hard to find people who talk english. If you talk english or understand feel free to add me in-game (AlmightyPear). I'm assembling a team.Note: Don't play this game for like 2-5 hours and start complaining. Practice is needed.			"

												I'm very conflicted. Pros: it's kind of like 'CoD for poor people'. Where I think this game has an advantage over CoD is there's no 'stupid deaths' so to speak. EI you're not gonna get killed by some stupid bout of luck like a claymore or a killstreak. It's pretty bare bones.Cons: really made me question if I wanted to recommend this game, but it's got the stupid typical korean p2w crap attached to it. The VIP is just...idk how to word it without just saying it's the stupidest ****. VIP gives you camos which increase your weapon damage and reduce recoil by 5%. But that's not all! it also allows you to spawn instantly...like really? Then this games got a super low population and they're gonna have this VIP crap in their game...their game may have been dying prior to this, but sure as hell adding the VIP crap isn't gonna make people wanna stay it's gonna kill your game that much faster. Two other lesser cons is there's a big lack of customization, not a lot of weapon choices, and I was really hoping for the cool cat gun I saw on youtube. Then lastly which also is a bit of a fun killer...some weapons are way over tuned. I've been using the...m16 I believe. 1 burst kills most I think that's a little redic. random tip: play on the EU. US is completely dead.Edit: at the moment it would seem the EU servers either got merged with the US or just got shut down. Any time I attempt login via EU it says the game isn't available in my region. I thought maybe a region lock was placed, but wouldn't let me on even with a VPN.			"

												With a couple of exceptions, Gameforge's games line-up is all about fantasy titles, however the publisher took a distance from their usual environment by offering you a brutal and competitive military-themed online FPS: S.K.I.L.L.S. - Special Force 2. With a lot of well established free MMOFPS out there, offering something capable to stand out and gather a consistent pool of players is certainly a tough challenge; and of course we couldn't miss the chance to see what Gameforge managed to do in a field that for them is totally new and unexplored, so follow us in this review and check out if the game is worth trying or not!The first impression upon entering into the game is somewhat both good and bad. It is good because everything is kind of familiar if you've ever played any other f2p MMOFPS, and you will basically know how to play and navigate in the different menus, but at the same time you will probably feel a sense of déjà vu as the developers' intention clearly wasn't to innovate or change the genre, but to offer their personal interpretation of a well-known and working formula. Speaking about menus, after the log-in you will be brought to a pretty standard home screen containing all the classic tabs that you would expect from a game like this: capsule market, shop, inventory, mini-game, career and clan. While shop, inventory and clan are pretty much self explanatory, the others may need a word or two about them. The capsule market is a place where you can buy different kinds of sealed boxes which contain a random item and give you the chance to obtain special and unique gear pieces. However, most of them are temporary, and you could end up with an item that you don't need at all, so choose wisely if it's worth to gamble or not. Regarding the mini-game tab, don't be too excited; the game offers some interesting and unique game modes, but in this tab the only thing you will find is only a free training mode where you can spawn dummies and do other stuff in order to get confident with controls and mechanics. In the career tab you can find all the information and statistics about your in-game performance and more. The game features a shop that offers a wide selection of digital reproductions of real firearms, which are usually available for both cash and in-game currency. Of course there are unique VIP weapons which are only available to VIP players, but from what I could see the differences are mainly cosmetic and intended to let you show off your VIP status. One thing that I appreciated a lot is the possibility to buy permanent weapons. They still need to be repaired, but this is a whole different thing compared to a lot of other free MMOFPS where you can only buy temporary weapons and you are forced to constantly play the game in order to buy them again when they expire. With this system, on the other hand, you can buy a new weapon, take a break from the game for some time and then come back without the fear of having wasted your precious weapon. The control system is standard and identical to almost every other modern FPS. However, I have to say that the jump feels a little strange. There are a lot of objects in the arena that seems to be there just to be climbed and that are not very tall, but you can't actually jump on them. As I said it's a little strange and sometimes kind of frustrating, but it is absolutely not a game-breaker. However, the point where the S.K.I.L.L . - Special Force 2 gameplay tries to differentiate itself from the masses, is probably the featured game modes: Deathmatch,Team Deathmatch, Seizure, Escape, Blasting, Manhunt, Glass, Hero, Sniper battle...there's a lot of them.Speaking about graphics, S.K.I.L.L. feels like a raw gem; they are not bad, instead, they are actually pretty good, but they just can't stand comparison with the latest free-to-play online FPS. S.K.I.L.L.'s graphics, while clean and enjoyable, lack in details and this makes the maps' design to look a little empty and too simple. The same deal goes with the sounds; they are not bad, but I think that the developers could have made a way better job with just a little more effort. The steps sounds are often a little unnatural, while the shooting and weapons sounds are average.S.K.I.L.L. - Special Force 2 is a valid free-to-play shooter which puts a lot of emphasis on community and clans. Even if it's not the best shooter around regarding graphics and sounds, it manages to offer a complete and fun overall gameplay experience and some pretty unique and fun game modes.			"

												All those comments about pay 2 win? They're not joking.TL;DR: Don't play unless you want to sink money into the game.I loved the fast paced environment and it felt pretty satisfying to kill people... provided they hadn't bought a gun better and get you first.  I played Seize first, and that was pretty fun although I'm not a fan of round based gamemodes. I leveled up twice and was super pumped to see the little amount of ""SP"" I won. I was disappointed to go back to the lobby and see I got nothing. What??? I understand most free to play games are not very generous to non-VIP/pay-to-get-a-membership but usually you get something. Okay...I tried the AI-bot gamemode next, that was awesome. Being able to get multiple double kills - SWEET! However, it wasn't hard because the map was basically a hall way and you could really only funnel out of one area making spawn killing just way too easy and unfair. Again. out of the lobby... I did get a little option to pick something. However, it was only an item you get for X amount of days. Boring. Again, no SP. Since the game mostly revolves around SP and having an INSANE amount for benefits (10,000+) or buying cash for cool items, I don't really want to continue playing when I can only play two gamemodes (the rest didn't have anyone playing, probably for this reason). Disappointing, but not the worst game in the world. You're better off to sink money into something more rewarding, in my opinion.			"

												It is free to play but not pay to win, and that automatically makes the game so much better than any others that indirectly force you to spend money to actually have fun. If you are really keen on spending money, you can buy some capsules that give you some good weapons, or buy V.I.P. to look so 1337 compared to your teammates with a coloured name and background.Beware, as there are hackers in public servers, but these can be kicked out of the game easily. What you'll encounter frequently is players using macros, which do the double-Q motion automatically while using snipers. Please, don't be one of these idiots.Like most games, this is more fun while played with friends. Specially the Hero mode, which is basically League of Legends in first-person perspective with shooter elements and Survival, which is PvE and consists of you and your team surviving waves of monsters. Regarding the Hero mode, I did compare it with LoL, but the thing is: I have played LoL and hated it, the whole MOBA aspect doesn't appeal to me, but playing a strategic MOBA-like game in first person shooter is so fun, and I congratulate the S.K.I.L.L. devs for adding this in.Other game modes: Glass, Seizure (i.e. CTF), Escape, Single (i.e. free-for-all DM), Defense (Survival with difficulties) and Manhunt (kind of like a PvP zombie mode, but against alien-ish creatures). There are also the classic FPS game modes: Team Deathmatch, Sniper - Point Battle (TDM with only snipers) and Blasting (bomb planting/defusing). As you can see, it has tons of game modes to satisfy a wide range of tastes.There's also an active competitive S.K.I.L.L.[play.eslgaming.com] scene, but I can't dwell much into that as I'm not part of it.The graphics are pretty good and you can configure them to your own liking. I don't care much for eye candy in first person shooters so I play in low graphics and get around 300 FPS. Oh, and this game doesn't require you to have a top of the line gaming PC. The recommended specs are 2 GB of RAM, a Core2 Duo E6600 or comparable and GeForce 8600 GT or higher. You can probably even play with a worse PC than that, but seriously, it's the second decade of the 21th century, you should already have a computer that's way more powerful than that. >tl;dr: very good free-to-play FPS. Downsides are some hackers and macro users, upsides are good graphics, gameplay and fun game modes. "

												Having played this game for dozens of hours via the Gameforge client, I now feel experienced enough to give you a rough overview over the game.BASICSSKILL is a PvP online shooter though also features several PvE modes; the game covers most standard game modes like Blasting (arming/disarming a bomb), Seizure (stealing an object) and Escape as well as the standard TeamDeathMatch. For those SKILL offers several dozen maps with different layouts, from small arenas like Hangar to slightly more open ones like Russian Factory. It’s worth keeping in mind, however, that the maps in general are not too big, though usually offering multiple paths and a good mix of open and more linear parts. In addition you can participate in some so called party-modes which involve playing in arenas made of breakable glass floors or jumping over obstacles.For everyone interested in coop-focused action there’re PvE modes against aliens and zombies as well as a moba-style mode with spawning alien bots as well as a leveling-up system.TECHNICAL STUFFOn the technical side the game is solid, with nice sound effects and weapon models though overall slightly dated graphics; when being in a tense multiplayer match, you probably won’t notice this too much though. It has to be said, however, that the game suffers from some performance troubles due a not really perfect optimisation which seem to have gotten worse over time. You may also encounter some connection problems from time to time which seem to appear out of nowhere but usually disappear as miraculously as they appeared.And yes, as in most F2P games you will also find hackers here in SKILL. Most of the time their numbers are rather low with the exception of some rare “hacker-waves”. While public matches are mostly fine, they seem to be a more common annoyance in clan matches.CLANS&TOURNAMENTSRegarding clans and eSports in general: The game features a built-in matchmaking system for clans as well as special channels for them, while the public matches are separate. Gameforge recently announced the end of the eSports leagues due to a lack of active players there, though maintaining the so called Go4Skill cup with money prizes as well as sponsoring community-organised tournaments.SHOPOf course you will find a lot of equipment items like hats, gloves, t-shirts etc in the ingame shop as it’s common for F2P games. The basic items are available for the normal currency SP which you can earn, more advanced ones which usually give you a money and experience boost have to be bought with Cash, the premium currency. This includes character skins which completely change your whole appearance as well as boosters, weapon camos etc.Talking about weapon: SKILL features a large amount of non-customizable weapons for every playstyle – all available for SP. You can set-up up to three different loadouts you can switch between during a match, consisting of one main gun, sidearm and special weapon (like throwing axes, bows, …) plus 3 different grenades. There’re, however, a couple of advanced weapons with shinier camos and attachments like better scopes which can only be obtained via the so called capsule market.Here you have to buy capsules with Cash to get a chance of winning one of those special guns. It’s pretty much a luck-based system though even if the capsule doesn’t drop the wanted weapon, you still get another item, camo or some SP.The capsule weapons have a slight stat-boost over their normal brethren, though it’s too small to make any difference in the game. The game still is true to it’s name and very much dependant on SKILL. It has to be said though, that there’re slightly troubling tendencies, with the last update introducing a gun with heavily improved stats for roughly three-times the price of the normal capsules. Let’s hope they don’t continue this road.MISCELLANEOUSIn more or less regular intervals new events are activated in the game. They usually last for only 2 or 3 weeks and aren’t really creative; the prizes are okay and can get you a temporary version of those precious capsule guns or the premium skins.Overall the update policy currently is a little bit weird, with a large break between the last two updates. It also has to be said that most updates only contain new content like maps, weapons, skins etc and only rarely additional features. Looking at the amount of requests and suggestions by the community since the launch in 2013 it seems like the developers are not really interested in adding new features, tweaks or fixing things.The VIP system which basically is some kind of subscription model currently offers a boost to your EXP and SP as well as access to a couple of silver or gold weapons which have the advantage of not having to be repaired. There’re some other, minor extras (special emblems, reduced quick-spawn costs, …) but overall it currently isn’t very attractive thing to invest in except right at the start of the game, where you’re more likely in money-troubles and can use the VIP-system to avoid repair-costs.SUMMARYSKILL definitely isn’t the holy grail of multiplayer shooters though it’s definitely a solid game with which you can have fun for a couple of hours, even more probably in a clan. Fortunately the game so far stayed away from the dark path of P2W, though as mentioned recent changes are troubling, especially combined with the slow updates.If you’re looking for a free, fast and simple PvP shooter or some horde-mode PvE action why not give this game a try – you most probably will spend some fun hours with it, there’re worse alternatives on the market right now ;)For some gameplay, check out my video review:

												I had high hopes for this game, but it failed for me. Bad. I know some people love this game, although it's not for me, it's a pay-to-win game. Either you grind for the in-game money or pay alot of money for a small amount. I personally dislike this game, to be fair it has awesome graphics and decent gameplay. I know what you thinking, I only have 30 minutes of gameplay but I saw enough in those 30 minutes, you have to buy guns to use in the game. The Pros and Cons will follow. Pros  1. Decent gameplay2. Great graphics3. ""Free"" Cons 1. Mirco-transactions everywhere (I know it's Free)2. Small Maps3. Werid gameplay mechanicsPrepare for war; bring your gun, your buddys, and most importantly your wallet. Thanks so much for reading.			"

												Special Force 2 is an easy for everyone FPS game because of it's very familiarformula of navigation and gameplay.This game has a very good feature that i liked the most from other FPS gameswhich wasn't other than the weapon shop buying feature which allow you to buyweapons for permanent use and not for temporary use which sadly forced you to buy them over and over when they expired.The grachics are very well balanced and the gameplay is standard and identical to almostevery other modern FPS.Another positive feature is that it contains a huge selection of game modes (TDM, DM, Survival, Defence, Seizure, Escape, Blasting, Party modes etc).You also have the ability to create-join with clans and experience head to head wars which is very interesting.The only minor thing i personally didn't like about was that some of the maps felt somewhat low detailed or eigher empty as far as enviroment content, but it could be not a big deal since the game has so much to offer for a free-to-play.Overall, SKILL Special Force 2 is clean and enjoyable with unique and fun game modes and it's the right choice for everyone who looks to have fun and also for the people who look for challenge and hardcore gameplay.I'll give it a score of 9/10.

												With a couple of exceptions, Gameforge's games line-up is all about fantasy titles, however the publisher took a distance from their usual environment by offering you a brutal and competitive military-themed online FPS: S.K.I.L.L.S. - Special Force 2. With a lot of well established free MMOFPS out there, offering something capable to stand out and gather a consistent pool of players is certainly a tough challenge; and of course we couldn't miss the chance to see what Gameforge managed to do in a field that for them is totally new and unexplored, so follow us in this review and check out if the game is worth trying or not!The first impression upon entering into the game is somewhat both good and bad. It is good because everything is kind of familiar if you've ever played any other f2p MMOFPS, and you will basically know how to play and navigate in the different menus, but at the same time you will probably feel a sense of déjà vu as the developers' intention clearly wasn't to innovate or change the genre, but to offer their personal interpretation of a well-known and working formula. Speaking about menus, after the log-in you will be brought to a pretty standard home screen containing all the classic tabs that you would expect from a game like this: capsule market, shop, inventory, mini-game, career and clan. While shop, inventory and clan are pretty much self explanatory, the others may need a word or two about them. The capsule market is a place where you can buy different kinds of sealed boxes which contain a random item and give you the chance to obtain special and unique gear pieces. However, most of them are temporary, and you could end up with an item that you don't need at all, so choose wisely if it's worth to gamble or not. Regarding the mini-game tab, don't be too excited; the game offers some interesting and unique game modes, but in this tab the only thing you will find is only a free training mode where you can spawn dummies and do other stuff in order to get confident with controls and mechanics. In the career tab you can find all the information and statistics about your in-game performance and more. The game features a shop that offers a wide selection of digital reproductions of real firearms, which are usually available for both cash and in-game currency. Of course there are unique VIP weapons which are only available to VIP players, but from what I could see the differences are mainly cosmetic and intended to let you show off your VIP status. One thing that I appreciated a lot is the possibility to buy permanent weapons. They still need to be repaired, but this is a whole different thing compared to a lot of other free MMOFPS where you can only buy temporary weapons and you are forced to constantly play the game in order to buy them again when they expire. With this system, on the other hand, you can buy a new weapon, take a break from the game for some time and then come back without the fear of having wasted your precious weapon. The control system is standard and identical to almost every other modern FPS. However, I have to say that the jump feels a little strange. There are a lot of objects in the arena that seems to be there just to be climbed and that are not very tall, but you can't actually jump on them. As I said it's a little strange and sometimes kind of frustrating, but it is absolutely not a game-breaker. However, the point where the S.K.I.L.L . - Special Force 2 gameplay tries to differentiate itself from the masses, is probably the featured game modes: Deathmatch,Team Deathmatch, Seizure, Escape, Blasting, Manhunt, Glass, Hero, Sniper battle...there's a lot of them.Speaking about graphics, S.K.I.L.L. feels like a raw gem; they are not bad, instead, they are actually pretty good, but they just can't stand comparison with the latest free-to-play online FPS. S.K.I.L.L.'s graphics, while clean and enjoyable, lack in details and this makes the maps' design to look a little empty and too simple. The same deal goes with the sounds; they are not bad, but I think that the developers could have made a way better job with just a little more effort. The steps sounds are often a little unnatural, while the shooting and weapons sounds are average.S.K.I.L.L. - Special Force 2 is a valid free-to-play shooter which puts a lot of emphasis on community and clans. Even if it's not the best shooter around regarding graphics and sounds, it manages to offer a complete and fun overall gameplay experience and some pretty unique and fun game modes. "

												ENGLISH AND SPANISH! INGLÉS Y ESPAÑOL!It is an awesome game! It is free to play and it has good graphics.The good part of this game is that you dont need a good computer to run it, because my one is a i5 with 8gb of RAM (i mean, it is not the best laptop in the world ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)). It has lots and lots of guns and camos. The only bad thing i find is that you have to buy some clothes, for example, the horse face, instead of being able to buy it with SPs. Anyways, it is so entertaining and fun... You can join a clan, get new weapons, level up your rank, play more than 12 different gamemodes. Only one word for this game: MAGIC!Es un juego fantástico! En serio lo recomiendo 100%! Desde el primer momento en el que lo jugué me quede viciadísimo a él. Además, se mejora de forma muy rápida: ha sido el primer FPS al que juego en PC. Recuerdo que al principio era un poco malo, pero ahora la verdad es que no hay nadie que me pare (por lo menos en el servidor de principiantes ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)), y eso que llevo jugando apenas 4 meses. Pero no sólo eso; hay una gran variedad de juegos, personajes, armas, ediciones de armas, clanes y las clásicas cápsulas (como las cajas de CS:GO). Por último, los gráficos son excelentemente buenos para ser de un Free-To-Play, y se puede jugar perfectamente desde un ordenador malo (de 3GB de RAM, por ejemplo).			"

Let me tell you that... this isnt a pay 2 win game. You just need skill, alot of it.I played this game on gamejolt. And i dont know why people hate this game, cause this game is awesome. Still time for pro'sPro's1. The maps are awesome.2. There are alot of fun gamemodes. Like hexagon. (In hexagon you can kill people or make them fall to death, and there are item boxes like in Mario Kart, which is awesome3. Clans, clans, and more clans. This game is filled with awesome clans. You can make a clan, you can do something what i call is cvc. (Clan VS Clan)4. The game feels like crossfire.5. There are no cons.Cons-There are no cons...I rate this game 11/10. Literally.Edit/Update:The game is still awesome, try it if you are bored and you dont know what to play!			"

												The gameplay is alright but vertical FOV is smaller in widescreen. To maintein such fov, you need to play with 4:3 resolution stretch or you ganna have hard time looking up or down. > FOV is lesser than 90 sadly, more suitable to play it on a TV screen playing it like a console game not PC. (The game is not suitable for everyone, shorten costumer range) > One shot headshot kill no matter what bullet and distance. Guns with high RPM have the most advantage. Eh, SMG anyone? And accurate and low recoil guns too, ""FAMAS anyone?"", make sense with rifle rounds but pistol and SMG rounds on a helmet from afar. > Maybe is a good idea to make all enemy model the same, models depending on the maps. This will nullify ""You use this model so you look slimer noob"".  Or ""I can hit your head easily cause of your blonde wigs""> Anyone with macro (Rapid Click Per Second) have more accuracy and recoil recovery than normal burst or full auto fire players sadly. Need to fix this or everyone gana use macro mouse and play this exploit. > Takes grinding to earn SP without VIP.			"

												Waste of time.This game only has people running around and hip firing and still manage to kill you, if you watch the Killcam back, they aim nowhere near you and still manage to kill you.The beginning weapons are underpowered and take many shots to kill someone.The killcam shows you a guy shooting at ya and magicaly getting a headshot without even aiming at you, this game makes ZERO sence on that part.So like Soldier Front way back in the day. If you pay, you gain an advantage so this game is sadly also Pay 2 Win. Oh yeah, LOTS of cheaters.			"

S.K.I.L.L. - Special Force 2 is a valid free-to-play shooter which puts a lot of emphasis on community and clans. Even if it's not the best shooter around regarding graphics and sounds, it manages to offer a complete and fun overall gameplay experience and some pretty unique and fun game modes. With its simple graphics and solid mechanics, combined with a fair in-game shop and a complete clan system, the game has the right tools to offer a nice competitive scene for hardcore players and an enjoyable environment for new players as well. If you are a fan of online FPS and want to try something new without going too far away from your usual games, S.K.I.L.L. - Special Force 2 could be the right choice.			"

												""Enemy helicopter is start ready.""In a nutshell, SF2 can be described as 'eh'. I played in closed beta a year or so back, maybe somewhere around 10 hours. I can't seem to link my account to Steam and it's forcing me to make a new character which I do not care to do, so I'm sure as hell not going to be using Steam to play it.Special Force 2 is the EU name for Soldier Front 2, the sequel to a Korean FPS made back in 2005, surprisingly named Soldier Front. SF1 had graphics from 2002 and game mechanics from 1995. Seriously. Creating a movement engine that doesn't allow you to go faster running diagonally was one of the first things I learnt as a hobbyist developer (Don't let anyone tell you Pythagoras' theory and trigonometry isn't useful), yet Soldier Front 1 still has this 'feature' well into 2015. I believe SF1 is on Greenlight in some form, but enough about that.The graphics are fine. Not spectacular, but not an eye-sore. The game tries very hard to be Call of Duty, and you can see it in the aesthetics of the HUD (In places they're not even trying to look different), and the gunplay (run and gun, ADS, all of that, you can't really complain about it, unless it's about how cookie-cutter it is). Game modes are your standard affair. 'Single' is deathmatch. Team Deathmatch is, well, team deathmatch. 'Blasting' is your standard Counterstrike bomb defusal mode. In 'Seizure', one team has to capture an item and bring it back to base, the other defends it. Simple enough. I haven't seen the 'Party' mode before, noted as the 'Glass' gamemode ingame, but it just seems to be a♥♥♥♥♥♥around mode probably taken from CS custom map. The real sore thumb is the 'Hero' mode, an FPS MOBA on some 3-laned alien landscape where you try to advance your load of aliens to the enemy base. Use gold earned from killing blows to buy stats and new guns. Cliche FPS mechanics fitted with cookie-cutter MOBA mechanics. Whatever.Soldier Front 1's store returns here in Special Force 2, where you have to repair guns after each use, stat-boosting armor and equipment are timed items, and the coolest stuff is behind luck-based capsules and other paywalls. Unlike the first game however, it seems (I may be wrong) paywall guns aren't utterly broken. The VIP guns are just gold/chrome reskins, perhaps with a sight or something. If you want to pay for that, enjoy,I guess.I haven't given it the greatest look, but without level up rewards and EXP/SP boosters, I think people would run at a loss trying to maintain all of their guns and other equipment. Admittedly I could make a better effort to save money, but already a few hours in they're not just throwing it out anymore.Maybe I will play it on occassion. Even I like a bit of Call of Duty sometimes. And I guess if you want to play Call of Duty without purchasing the latest games over and over again, this would be it.			"

												Just your generic Korean free to play and pay to win first person shooter.  Most of these games are better being played in one life game modes instead of team deathmatch.  Originally as Soldier Front 2, this game doesn't have much to really live up to besides being somewhat of a Call of Duty clone.  It's an okay game but it can definitely be better but if these developers want to actually want to be relevant, they need to start changing up and bring in new features instead of using the same old feature over and over again.  A lot of these F2P P2W FPS games are dying but it's good though, we got better games like Overwatch and Rainbow Six Siege.			"

												Played 506 hours on the original game. It is by far one of my favorite games. But the downside of this game is the bad community. There are always a guy who is looking to ruin the game for the others. and then there is these new kids who think that you are hacking only because you can kill them. But all in all this is an amazing game, and if you join a clan you can use some sick tactics to win over the other clans. 8,5 out of 10. (And it would be nice if you added the *change account* option to the game menu)			"

												This game has many problems, but its still fun for a couple of hours. If you expect an AAA title you are looking at the wrong game tho. The movement and gun handling feels good but the hitbox is just weird sometimes. When you get killed, you see in the killcam that you were already gone and the guy who shot you didnt even aim near you, but still killed you. Sadly thats a common thing. And hackers are also a huge problem, hence its free 2 play.All in all its a about average free to play FPS since it does not look like its just pay2win and build to cash in for the devs. If you love f2p FPS games and you are fed up with your old one, go try this.If you are looking for AAA fps, you might get disappointed.

												Like so many other games its broken in so many sectors... with cheating rampid and lack of ability to report and remove these obvious cheaters is a serious issue.  On top of that the game continues along like every other fps with loads of microtransactions that will give you hugh advantanges against other players in a number of ways.   I find it easier just to start a private room against AI or play the PvE modes.   If you avoid public rooms and play with only friends the game can be quite entertaining, that or have VIP access to remove cheaters quickly without limitations due to not being on a cheaters team or the fact that only 1 report every 24 hours can be made per day even if you run into 10 different cheaters throughout gameplay in a single session.  (Note when I claim cheaters, these are people who can be seen in the kill cam without a weapon in hand at their spawn point killing the other team at their spawn point with nothing but headshots.)All in all, its just like every other FPS with no real change.   Guess the point here is the base engine is so easy to use that any idiot can make this type of FPS and put microtransactions in the game to milk it for as much as you want and ignore the obvious issues that plague FPS shooters.

												A ""barely there"" kind of recommendation. Nicely done CoD clone with microtransactions. I would recommend that you buy CS:GO or something else instead, because having to grind for hours to get some weapons is really annoying.			"

												Really good game, worth taking a moment to look at. Alot of different modes to chose from and the gameplay somewhat reminds of the famous Call of Duty franchise. The graphics are fairly good as well (played on high quality textures) So yes I definetly reccomend the game for many competetive fps gamers out there. Not to mention that the game has been put into the ESL ONE, what makes it much more competetive than it was intednded to be at first. This is why there is still quite a few bugs to be fixed, e.g. terrible hitbox and kill cam needs a work on. But other than that I can say the game is worth a while.			"

												So.. this game is complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ First the graphics: You cant costumize them, you only have low, medium, high etc. Second the tutorial isn't telling you much about the gameplay. ; As for my first match, i put more than 10 bullets into a guy using a stock m4a4 (i think it was an M4A4) and 2 more with a pistol but he killed me...... This is like a free COD multiplayer, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanics, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics. If you dont want to buy a COD game for its multiplayer this is the game for you. If you are looking for a tactical, team based game stay away from this.			"

												I don't know if this is death cam problem , latency problem or this game doesn't require aiming because 90% of death cams show that person shooting at you was nowhere close to you (especially with sniper rifles).Earning SP in this game is made to make you want spend money. I had to play 4.7h with sp boost to get 3000 sp when new weapon cost ~25000. You don't get sp after each game like in most games you get ~1-3% to your sp bar and you get sp only when it reaches 100% (3k sp).I haven't played that much to be sure but it seems that vip(paid subscription) weapons have more damage and vip payers are harder to kill (not because they are better but because they are more bullet spongey).

												S.K.I.L.LPros.+ Not pay2win+ Good selection of guns+ Great maps with many ranges and perches+ I especially love the special look for different ""goverments"" (or whatever) we're in.+ Different zooms for gunsCons.- Annoying with the time of puchased weapons and extras until it expires- AWP Phoenix's zoom and time to reload and horrendous.- The amount of ways to get killed is stupid. There's really no place to stop by and reload before going back into battle.- No ups/downs for secondary weapons and such. Only primary weapons.- No shotguns or miniguns?Overall I think S.K.I.L.L has the potention to become one of the best FPS Shooter games. Perhaps as good as CS:GO as you don't have to pay as much to get good guns - never mind the huge price to buy the game itself. Graphics could be improved but it's quite realistic (in a virtual way). I love how there're different zooms for different guns and they've added just about everything but shotguns and miniguns. It would be awesome if you could hit players with guns too for those who don't have time to press f, especially with a slow tomahawk. Very good for a free game.I definitely recommend this to those who wish to have a fair chance and love multiplayer and shooter games. Also those who love sniping others from afar and spraying bullets into people from behind. Lmao.			"

												First of all its not really often that I submit reviews to games without at least playing it for a good amount of hours. But this game is one of those exceptions. I couldn't even successfully start up the game without some sort of errors. I tried to start the game and it had incredibly long wait times just to even start it. I looked at the damn logo for upwards of 5 minutes per startup. Lemme inform you that I tried to start the game upwards of 5 times and all ending in failure. Got to where you choose your character and the gun, and then it just had errors. Wouldn't advise you to even install this game, tried to fix it but coming up with nothing. It's gonna be fun to uninstall.			"

												I previously had 4k hours on this game. What makes this game one of the best shooters is the community and the competitive scene. The only problem I have with the game is hundreds of users using third party software to create a dot on their screen so they don't need to scope even at medium to long distances because the sniper rifles shoot very accurately even whilst not scoped in. It wasn't like that in SKILL1/SF1. If they fixed that then the game would be much better.			"

												This game is the best F2P shooter i played.Graphics are one of the best ive seen for a f2p game.the verity of guns and maps it quite big.constent updates(ive played the game for 1.5 years)the community is like in any other game sometimes u meet nice ppl sometimes u meet awful ppl.But i think every1 flames once in a while XDdepends on ur mood like 90% of the ppl i know get mad and trash talk atleast once in a while so overall the comunity is nice .this game has a really big amount of game modes most of the are familiar to most of u who tried playin an fps game b4 but there are some unique game modes like HERO mode witch is a moba style kinda mode really rare mode for fps games.If ur looking to find a group to play in it sreally easy to get into a clan of ur skill lvl and start playin some Clan wars.Clan wars channels are fluded with ppl so its really awesome that u dont need to wait for ages like in other games.The competitive scene is one of the best ive seen in f2p games and its always growing .The devs always listen to what the cumminity has to say .Ive been playin the game for a while now and ive seen the community complains on a few aspects of the game.and sooner or later the devs always managed to find an answer.u can   always join the game forums aswell.http://board.skill.gameforge.com/if u have any questions most of them can be answered hereabout P2W from what i know a gun won in the capsule shop have stats improved by 5% so its nothing that can break the game if u are decent at fps games this game is as easy as it gets aim for the head end of story.So overall best f2p game ive played really worth a try and maybe well even meet :D   "

												Played this game but steam say that I actually did so instead of judging the game here's a cool way to make skinny guacamoles with homemade baked tortilla chips :Skinny Guacamole:2 medium green sweet peppers2 medium fresh poblano chile peppers1 bulb garlic1/2 teaspoon olive oil2 roma tomatoes, seeded and chopped1 serrano pepper, minced2 medium ripe avocados, halved, seeded, peeled, and diced1 teaspoon lime zest2 tablespoons lime juice1/2 teaspoon saltBaked Tortilla Chips:Corn tortillasOlive oil spraySaltFor the guacamole:Preheat oven to 425° F. Line a 15 x 10 x 1-inch baking pan with foil; set aside. Quarter, stem, and seed the peppers. Place pepper quarters, cut sides down, in the prepared pan. Cut off the top half inch of the garlic bulb to expose ends of individual cloves. Leaving garlic bulb whole, remove any loose, papery outer layers. Place bulb, cut end up, on a double thickness of foil. Drizzle with the oil. Bring foil up around bulb and fold edges together to loosely enclose. Place foil packet on the pan with the peppers.Roast peppers and garlic for 20 to 30 minutes or until pepper skins are charred and garlic cloves feel soft. Allow to cool about 15 minutes. When garlic head is cool enough to handle, squeeze garlic paste out of the individual cloves.In a food processor combine roasted pepper quarters and the garlic paste. Cover and pulse until combined, but still slightly chunky.In a large bowl, combine tomatoes and serrano pepper. Add roasted pepper and garlic combination and stir to combine. Add diced avocado, lime zest, lime juice, and salt. Gently toss to combine.Serve immediately or cover the surface with plastic wrap and chill for up to 1 hour.For the chips:Cut corn tortillas into wedges and place on a foil-lined baking sheet. Spray lightly with olive oil spray and season with salt, to taste.Bake in a 350° F oven for 8-10 minutes or until lightly golden brown.			"

												This free FPS is actually pretty good. Nice graphics and working mechanics makes it a good choice if you're looking for a new game to play.The ""P2W"" a lot of people complain about is definitely there since VIP status will give you 5% more damage and 5% reduction on recoil on certain weapons. But overall I didn't really notice it and killed many VIPs.You start with a permanent weapon (which require repair, but it is cheap) and you will get in-game currency to get an extra primary or whatever you'd like to buy in the beginning.Game modes are fun and the maps are good. So my experience with the game itself so far is good and I would recommend it because of that. But then I noticed how toxic the community is. If you do not like chats filled with ""noob this and noob that"" then you might aswell just skip this one. I've been kicked for being too good and kicked for being bad. Sadly this is just how free FPS games are, mostly filled with angry kids and troubled teenagers. I've been playing for 3 hours before I wrote this, but that is enough for me to see how bad this game's community is.			"

												Played this game but steam say that I actually did so instead of judging the game here's a cool way to make skinny guacamoles with homemade baked tortilla chips :Skinny Guacamole:2 medium green sweet peppers2 medium fresh poblano chile peppers1 bulb garlic1/2 teaspoon olive oil2 roma tomatoes, seeded and chopped1 serrano pepper, minced2 medium ripe avocados, halved, seeded, peeled, and diced1 teaspoon lime zest2 tablespoons lime juice1/2 teaspoon saltBaked Tortilla Chips:Corn tortillasOlive oil spraySaltFor the guacamole:Preheat oven to 425° F. Line a 15 x 10 x 1-inch baking pan with foil; set aside. Quarter, stem, and seed the peppers. Place pepper quarters, cut sides down, in the prepared pan. Cut off the top half inch of the garlic bulb to expose ends of individual cloves. Leaving garlic bulb whole, remove any loose, papery outer layers. Place bulb, cut end up, on a double thickness of foil. Drizzle with the oil. Bring foil up around bulb and fold edges together to loosely enclose. Place foil packet on the pan with the peppers.Roast peppers and garlic for 20 to 30 minutes or until pepper skins are charred and garlic cloves feel soft. Allow to cool about 15 minutes. When garlic head is cool enough to handle, squeeze garlic paste out of the individual cloves.In a food processor combine roasted pepper quarters and the garlic paste. Cover and pulse until combined, but still slightly chunky.In a large bowl, combine tomatoes and serrano pepper. Add roasted pepper and garlic combination and stir to combine. Add diced avocado, lime zest, lime juice, and salt. Gently toss to combine.Serve immediately or cover the surface with plastic wrap and chill for up to 1 hour.For the chips:Cut corn tortillas into wedges and place on a foil-lined baking sheet. Spray lightly with olive oil spray and season with salt, to taste.Bake in a 350° F oven for 8-10 minutes or until lightly golden brown.			"

												My opinion:This game is a 5/10This game is exciting and very fun to play at times, however one needs a full wallet to be the best. I like to call this ' may the richest player win '. This is because there are many micro transactions (in game purchases) that to buy them all you would have to be a millionaire, there are that many that this game is forced to be under the pay-to-win section. This is because people with the real money payed guns will destroy ones without. Another fault in this game is that when me and my friend ( ' Lord Commander Jon Snow ' ) were playing a game (ask him if this you don't believe) we found a hacker. and what really annoyed me was the person had aimbot. The thing is, this person was absolutely terrible at using this aimbot, luckily, however there needs to be more secure servers.On another note, this game was quite addicting and fun to play at times, with good gameplay and decent maps. the guns are quite good too.There was another problem too. Unbalanced as hell.Get the £500 guns vs free guns, one shot kill.Although they are paying for the guns, there needs to be some balancing involved.I do put my textures low for maximum framerate, however the textures do need upgrading. The snow looks like a big sheet of white cardboard on the floor.overall - bad -1. Unbalanced2. Pay-to-win3. Hackers4. Texturesgood -1. Nice maps2. Good guns3. Good gameplayIn this review there are more negatives (major negatives) than there are positives (major positives), therefore this review is going to be negative, however I still believe the game is worth a try :) Thanks -Will			"

												Overall, a fairly generic fps in the call of duty style of little aim and lots of running. It features lots of different game modes, some seeming more at home in Garrys Mod, so there's a fair amount of different things to do, although it has no singleplayer/coop element. The balancing is decent, though not great, but the biggets failing of the game is the complete lack of anti-hacking measures, leading to nearly every game featuring one or more hackers. In my opinion, this is completely gamebreaking, and with an unexceptional core gameplay I see no reason to choose this game over another with proper protections and a more sportsmanly playerbase.

												This is one of the most pay to win games I've ever seen, actually make that THE most pay to win game I've ever seen.spending real money in the game gives you:-More damage-Less recoil-More resitance (armor)-More in-game money (this one is kind of a given)-The ability to purchase scopes and other attachements (A normal player CAN'T buy any sights, supressors or laser sights)As a non payer player, you'll have to grind A LOT, to get any weapons, and the best thing of all is  that you have to repair your weapon from time to time as it gets damaged from being used, wich is the best way of spending your hard gained money, in the past 5 day.On top of that there is NO INGAME REPORT SYSTEM, so you can flame and hack to your hearts content as you are very likely to not be caught. Although it has some fun mods, they don't compensate for the Pay to Win factor of the game (And the sexist one, as in order to be a women you have to pay €50 and it's sexuality)If you want to play the kind that as objective based gameplay, buy CS:GO, if you want to play in more closed maps play CoD (in fact CoD maps have much more verticality and alterbative routes that the ones of S.K.I.L.L) and if you want to play a Free to Play first person shooter on Steam, you are better of with PlanetSide 2 or even Firefall.

												I have to say that i hate this game after it didnt connect me to my steam account, and im too lazy to start from over.But i still have to reccomend this game. Its not that bad as it looks.Many of you though that this game is insane P2W, actually, it kinda is P2P, if you meet someone who spend a lot of money it doesnt even matter. I did not spent even a cent to this game and im very often on first position in tabThis game is easy tho, weapon recoil is like from CoD so there is no problem to kill someone with double scorpions from one end of map to secondi had, a lot of fun, i met a lot of friends.Also everyone says that comunity in this game is awfull, everyone calls you noob, idiot, PoS, fuc.er etc. but i played a lot of games and i met like 1 guy? thats all.Also there is some big nonsense in this game..im not sure if i should call it nonsense but i saw few ppls just quickscoping tru whole map. Like, im not calling them hackers or something but im just saying that this game got some searious problems sniper rifles :D.After a lot of battles, i met only one hacker (ab wh)..just looking into wall on our spawn and killing everyone on other side of the map, but he got banned(maybe) pretty fast, in like 2 minutes)i usually played TDM than the other mods but they are pretty fun too.One thing that i dont understand is that i find more AI team deathmatch than any other mods(please..tell me why...)Graph. isnt that bad too ;)When i started the game, i was kinda scared to play because i was lvl 1 and everyone was on like 15 lvl or 12 etc. but it doesnt matter, really.. if you played some fps games then you are ready to play.pros-a lot of fun-quickscope MLG 360 get rekt scrub-you can create your own clan for free after you reach needed level- a lot of mods with even more big maps!-pretty amount of weapons-there is actually first person MOBA game mode called hero mode and i had fun while playing it-funny moments ( 360 random shot, random grenade)-feeling badass when you kill few ppls in a row-you can actually mlg with a sniper rifle-mlg-you can open capsules and try to get something cool-translation. It surprised me when i discovered that it have my languagecons-a lot of items are for real money but they are mostly useless-there are few kinds of capsules that you can open, but only one of them are possible to open for game money-its easy to rage-i had few bugs when i tried to connect to a server (not sure if that was my problem)-expensive items for game money-its hard to make money..you get money for lvling up or doing ''achievements'' (killing 75 ppls with sniper rifle etc.)-when you start the game, you are kinda confused what is what in the menu-few bugs-There is a kil-cam that is sooooooooo bad that when someone kills you and then you see the kill cam, it shows you that he was for example, shooting somewhere around you but he headshoted you somehow.- There are three loadouts that you can use. But you cant use more loadouts for same weapon (fe. If i put a sniper rifle in LoadoutA, i cant put in in LoadoutB. I have to replace them)This game is worth a try			"

It surprised me when i discovered that it have my languagecons-a lot of items are for real money but they are mostly useless-there are few kinds of capsules that you can open, but only one of them are possible to open for game money-its easy to rage-i had few bugs when i tried to connect to a server (not sure if that was my problem)-expensive items for game money-its hard to make money..you get money for lvling up or doing ''achievements'' (killing 75 ppls with sniper rifle etc.)-when you start the game, you are kinda confused what is what in the menu-few bugs-There is a kil-cam that is sooooooooo bad that when someone kills you and then you see the kill cam, it shows you that he was for example, shooting somewhere around you but he headshoted you somehow.- There are three loadouts that you can use. But you cant use more loadouts for same weapon (fe. If i put a sniper rifle in LoadoutA, i cant put in in LoadoutB. I have to replace them)This game is worth a try			"

												I have recommended this game on the basis they sort everything out in the near future which I don't think they will do as they recently stopped running the servers in Indonesia in early december. Firstly, the community is♥♥♥♥♥♥ If you are good, you are a cheat. If you wear armor you are a tank, if you use a certain gun you are a noob. If you hack, you say you are esl.Before you read below - my KD is 1.6 so when I moan about hackers, it isn't because I am a noob.Secondly, there are so many hackers in this game. You won't very often come across someone with an aimbot but you have so many wallhackers in the game it's unbelievable. Don't get me wrong, if you have headphones and good sound you can hear people from a mile away stomping around like an elephant. But when you're walking and someone is just sat there waiting for you (really somewhere you wouldn't normally wait) then you know whats up. Combined with my SF Asia account I have a lot of hours on this game, it's fun and addictive in the right rooms. People say it's a pay to win game, not really. The game is mainly about headshots, what ever HP you have or armor.. you'll still die if you are hit in the head.Anyways, do more about hackers because you really are not doing fk all about it. Also make windowed mode go down to taskbar and not a 360x140 box.. thank you.			"

												Tato hra má v sobě docela dost herních módů u kterých jsem strávil trochu času, ale když jsem šel hrá deatmach tak jsem se zasekl a vzpomněl si na název hry ""S.K.I.L.L."" , ale jelikož mě zabíjel samej cápek s prémiovými zbraněmi, tak jsem si uvědomil, že do téhle nepotřebujete vaše zkušenosti z her atd.  ale stačí do téhle hry dát vaší kreditku a můžete být jeden z nejlepší a nemusíte mít strach že by vás nějaký normální hráč nějak hodně zabíjel, protože má základní zbraně, tak proč by vás zabíjel když má základní zbraně a vy prémiové, že ? Takže tato hra je zase jeden z těch pay2win ukázek a to tady nebudu mluvit o hackerech v této hře, zkráceně tuto hru nedoporučuji.3/10			"

I think this game is 70% bad and 30% good cuz you can practise and the graphics are amazing , but there is many cheaters. And it's fantastical that you need to shoot in the head atleast 10 - 15 times. The game is free that is good.			"

												Played 1 match. And can say few things of all games of that kind and that level of quality i've played before. It is almost same to AVA. But...1. Menu is freaken uncomfortable.2. Hipshot and zoom/aim sight mode doing almost same spray & recoil. That mean that Aim(zoom) on all weps except sniper ones is almost useless function and making this game to look like another Counter Strike type of game.3. Quality of ingame browser/menu: Buttons, functions, pushing em, reacting on player actions looks quiet cheap.4. ... i've played pvp 1 round was nice game, my team won it, i've got few ranks and..... shouldn't there be ingame money rewards for this? Money/cash did not came automatically after round, so my cash stayed 0/0, i dont know what need to do to get them or how much more rounds i need to play to get em, but i dont fkn care. I got used to be rewarded after each round. This is game fail to me.5. I did not found on the screen where is PVE/Zombie missions... i did not payed a lot of attention to it. But anyway such a simple thing should be much simplifyed as hell. I just screwed it up. If i want to spend some money i will do it on some other games but not on this one. This is just not worth.6. Bomb plant mode i've played had 12 rounds, In that kind of game I got used to play not more then 8 rounds. So this is too long.--------------Only few thing that i liked this game is fast killing, fast acting... but i already have that stuff in 10++++ of other games of that kind. Overall... game is not bad but also not good enough to compare it to CS:GO/1.6, Ava, Dirty Bomb or even low quality FPS Warface(in this case the damage register may be better in this game, but i will still choose laggy Warface) People argue about old school FPS game,,, i think there are enough of Counter Strike type games already. And people know titles like CrossFire, Combat Arms, AVA, Black Shot.... etc. This game is similar to them and have the most uncomfortable menu interface functions & settings.Ok ... the only 2 reason i liked this game is U3 Engine. I just love that engine. And this game it is basicly free to play.Overall ... /fingerdown.			"

												I've played this game before (not on steam) and put some decent hours into it.At the end it's not worth it. Believe me.(Had to play at least 5 minutes on steam to be able to write a review)(I just AFK'd the launcher for 5 minutes because I don't want to play this game ever again in my life)The game actually feels somewhat decent when you play it but it doesn't take long before you are matched against some players with purple shining VIP armor and weapons who are unbelievably bad at the game but still destroy you because they are harder to kill and their guns do more damage. In other words, Pay 2 Win.Also (but like in every game nowadays) cheaters are a problem, it seems like the anti cheat they use is so old or it doesn't even do anything.The competitive side is somewhat okay-ish if you play on ESL. It's not allowed to use VIP items in those matches (afaik) but you will be teamed up with people who are probably going full keen bean mode and will flame you to death if you are not half decent in the game, so have fun with that.Without the pay 2 win VIP items bulshit I would probably recommend this game and rate it even as high as a solid 7/10 for a free shooter. But the P2W just ruins all the fun for people who don't want to throw money at this game.			"

												This game has some amazing features.You don't actually need to aim at your enemy to hit him, the bullets will deflect mid-air to guide themselves to your target.Secondly, who needs killcams, right? I mean, they added the killcam feature in yet it laggs more than the average russian on CS:GO.Thirdly, I got rewarded for quitting the game! Seriously though, when I pressed the quit button I got an award for being the 2000th player to login (even though i was logging out). And then it asked if I wanted to go back into the game instead, even though I very consciously pressed the quit button.That's amazing!Would I recommend this game to people that have absolutely nothing to do with their lives, that have no social life whatsoever, live on government welfare and are willing to pay to win for an amazing shooter game? No I wouldn't. Even those people deserve better.Please don't waste your time.Thank you and please come again.			"

												I like this game for many reasons:-The zombie survival coop is not easy even at easy mode (unless you're in 3 or 4).-The hardcore mode is very well done on competitive.-Hexa League and Hexa Glass are ♥♥♥♥ing awesome and funny to play.-Fast Matchmaking and no ping problems at all.-Many game modes,really customizable in the lobby options.I dislike this game for the following reasons:-The not-hardcore mode is too unbalanced,VIP players are hugely advantaged,or simply the ones who shopped a ""pro"" weapon.-The hardcore mode is difficult to find in the servers,it is about 2% of the overall.-Some cheats somewhere.-Plenty of cheats in Sniper-only mode,I was like ""Seriously you killed me across the map through 12 different walls and an entire '600 castle? Come on.."".-Key settings are not easy and you can't set ""hold-toggle"" to crouch.-Achievements missing. Not a main problem but they would be appreciated.I'd recommend to give it a try,I liked it! ^^Simply don't play standard mode if you didn't buy any VIP weapon,you'll simply waste your time.			"

												heres my opinion of this game.pros:-free to play-fast paced-awesome maps-many gamemodes-good weapons-NOT pay to win. i have had VIP and really, it doesnt make a big difference.-can open cases without real money-good, simple graphics. not too many details like some other games.-good scopes-good playerbase, has competitive pro matches in esl.cons:-takes AGES to open the game-really needs zombies-no weapon trading-no teamspeak (exept chat)something to note:-there are many spawn campers in tdm. it takes time to get use to them. you have spawn protection so its fairly easy to kill at least few of them.-yes, many maps are small but thats how its meant to be, fast paced.-the random spawn in tdm is♥♥♥♥♥♥ so thats why i avoid playing in desert camp or farmhouse. try dam of hangar instead-if you are tired of the noobs, try playing on the alpha servers.conclusion:this is by far my most favourite pc game i have ever played 10/10EDIT: zombie mode is awesome :-)really needs spectating pro matches/go4skill, because without it i feel like a part of the game is missing.

												One of the worst FPS i've ever played... The games weapons aren't balanced in the slightest, as of your first 2 guns the M4A1 and the K2 (i think) they seem ok at first, until you meet people with anything else, who manage to beat you bullet for bullet. The recoil system is pathetic, barely effecting the guns in any way, so you may aswell pick up the highest dps gun available and use it. Also the hit boxes are slightly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, a random number of bullets will just seem to not connect in any way even though they could be standing still and the previous few did...Then we have the sniper rifles...  Completely awful in their own right, the most overpowered weapons ever imagined for a game, and if that wasn't bad enough, while using a sniper rifle the hit boxes seem to completely distort, shooting someone how you would in any other shooter doesn't work, instead you seem to need to DELIBERATELY MISS to actually hit someone. I only discovered this by watching the killcams, in which people were killing me by shooting 5 ft to the left of me, so i tried this and behold - it worked, at which point God like powers are held, especially since for close range you just no scope and hit practically every time. The graphics themselves aren't too bad, not requiring much of you system to play, feeling on par with Blackwatch but with alot less lag. But finally we have he worst point in the game; the community! I've only played for an hour or so, and have only found 1 person who speaks English, and even they wouldn't talk for God knows what reason. The rest of the players are Russian, and occasionally write a message, but that's it.All in all, this game is a 3/10 and I hope it improves over time to atl east equal COD (as its practically a clone) but i doubt it will. Though without the needed upgrades / changes this game will die within a year at best.			"

												This game is very fun and addictive , which you may have heard i think that it's addictive because of the fun you have practicing the skills you need to play the game . So maybe its the skills you need to play the game that make it so addictive?The graphics aren't the best and they aren't the worst but the graphics don't make the game this game is a competitive game so fps (frames per second ) is more important than the graphics.I FULLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME IT IS THE BEST!!!

												S.K.I.L.L. - Special Force 2 is like a free CoD or CS, and it's awesome. There's a great shop system, and if you don't have enough money for an item you can get a free trial of it, the average being 7 days. You get a plentiful amount of the standard virtual currency, which is enough if you're grateful for the things you get. This makes it a miracle - a free game that isn't Pay to Win. Sure, you can spend real money on items, but you're never forced to. This is fantastic and it makes the game extremely enjoyable, and you can rack up lots of time on it. I got this game solely to pass the time, but now I'm addicted. Every time I go into my games library, my mouse immediately heads to the game's play button and clicks it. I can't stop it.			"

												Basically a CounterStrike wannabe.Well, at least you can aim down the sights (thank God), so that makes me happy. The inventory management reminds me of Hazard Ops, which I'm not sure is a good thing. The ""violence"" feel here is literally non-existant.It could be better, to be honest, but it's not really bad either.I'm just recommending it because it's free, there are better ways to use your money so don't bother buying anything. Had this been a pay-to-play game I would've given it the middle finger and moved on.			"

												If you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients- To Make the Dough375 grams (3 cups) plain flour1/2 teaspoon salt2 eggs1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) waterExtra flour for dusting - To Make Cheese Filling15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.1/2 cup cheddar cheese2 eggs, lightly beaten1/2 teaspoon salt1/2 teaspoon pepper- ExtrasYour favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)Parmesan cheeseBasilFried vegetablesShrimpFish slicesChicken pieces Make the Ravioli filling.- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Make the Ravioli dough.- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest - Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!

												Great game, if you are looking for a free to play version of COD combined with Counter Strike look no further. This game combines great visuals(considering it is a free2play game), competitive gameplay, it is not pay2win, you can apply for tournaments every sunday with prizes for the winners up to 300euros, you may find the community a little bit toxic (just like in cod :] ).Also if you are looking for the best weapon, Howa Type 89 is beast!!!10/10 Recommended!!

Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest - Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!

												I think this game is everything a multiplayer fps fan is looking for. The developers really had the common shooter fan in mind, that's for sure. You have the usual rent a gear system, you can make your character look as cool as you want, or if it's goofiness you are looking for, it's in there too. You can buy weapons permanently, if you want to try them out first, you just have to get them from daily rewards, or capsules. Sadly you can't put attachments on your weapons, if you want guns with holo sights, you can to open capsules. There are a lot of game modes besides the usual TDM and bomb planting, like convoy, manhunt, seizure, escape, pve and a lot more. The biggest charm of the game for me is the lack of loading times, the action is almost constant. You get in a room, hit F5, and you are in the game. Also before joining a running game you actually get the scores the two teams are having, so you know, if a game is ending soon. The graphics are pretty, the reload animations are well done, ragdolls look so real. There is killcam, even showing the path of the grenade that killed you. While gun damage is pretty realistic (considering the players have armor on), you can play a less forgiving hardcore mode. if you want to. You can buy countless skins, boosts, premium membership (that gives other players xp, and money boost), equipment for real money, but i think the prices might be a bit high. I can only recommend this game. Reminds me a lot of Call of Duty 4, and that's one of my favorite shooters.			"

I played ESL versus on this game. Some people said this game isn't good because there is a shop where the people can buy items with real money, the items are only skins and level up boost wich don't count in the gameplay, u can buy perma items without any skin with ""game money"" (SP). Nobody have any reason to say this game su.cks because it has a ""shop like f2p"".THEY ARE ONLY SKINS AND NOT MORE.			"

												Surprisingly above average russian combat arms clone with a ton of modes, guns, and creativity.My first match I was using crossbows in a maze with see through walls in a giant neon game show arena, the next round we were throwing balls at each other to break tiles below each other. It was like Counter Strike mixed with Gmod Tower.Weirdly enough, this game stands out from the crowd. If you need something mindless to play, definitely pick this one up. It needs players.			"

												Edit: Just learnt that THIS is Soldier Front 2. Also just realized Soldier Front 2 and Special Force 2 have the same amount of letters....coincidence? I think not. Okay obviously it was intentional...I'm just going to leave.At first when I launched the game it said ""Not available in your region"". I was pretty bummed out to read that. Gave it a thumbs down. But then I found out when the launcher pops up you have to switch it to North American servers via the launcher in order to play. The servers seem kind of dead to me. Got on to test the game mechanics, feels a little bit like Ghost in The Shell SAC First Assault Online if anyone has played that. I mainly downloaded the game because facebook advertisement and apparently Halloween sale. I went on to see what I could buy via premium currency (just to take a look I swear). Stuff isn't cheap. But hey, you can buy the normal version of weapons for GP or whatever the in-game currency is so thats a plus. Also the weapons are permanent by the looks of it so another plus! They use the good ol' repair system for weapons found in quite a lot of F2PFPS games.			"

												This game is what you´d expect from a free2play (and pay2win btw) Shooter. Runs on unreal engine 3, has premium currency and last and definitely least Case (or capsule) openings. The start in this game is a bit hard depending on what weapon you choose, you get called a n00b and get kicked because of said reason.As you rank up, kill players and earn currency you get more respect. However i do not recommend to spend money on weapons and skins because it all (more or less) depends on S.K.I.L.L. I still do recommend getting this game because you can play it with your Friends that cannot afford CS:GO.			"

Pros:+Mostly Skill Gameplay+You can pick up weapons from other persons+Mostly Balanced+No pay2Win+a ""normal"" communityCons:-Sometimes(but not often) hackers.(but all games have hackers....)-NOTHING "

												I think this game is a solid free to play FPS with addictive gameplay. Easy to login and start playing, but hard to stop, although the netcode could use some attention of the developers (can get a bit laggy at times). Brutal violence (can be turned off) and interesting clan battle system if you want to get a richer teamplay experience. The graphics are allright and I believe it will  run fine on older hardware. I bet it will even run on your toaster...  It has a lot of gamemodes to keep you from boredom (PVE, PVP and even Tower defense). It even has a training mode where you can place your own target dummies. Certainly a must try for the FPS enthousiast. I had some good adrenaline shots during this game while playing clan battles. Mostly when all eyes are on you ;). Good game & Have fun!			"

												Very bad game. You need to shoot an enemy 10-15 times with a M4A1 to kill him. Extremely unrealistic. Better buy Arma 2 if you want a realistic FPS game. Also there are a lot of microtransactions, there is a vip pack that gives you more damage! Its one of the worst P2W games ever. Buy CS:GO or get TF2 For free.			"

												If your in North America then you're♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck Aeria Games (the company that ran the game for North America, Europe and latin america) have closed the North American version, leaving only the European version running and is left region locked (meaning you MUST be European in Europe to play). So if you want to play a game that is made by a south korean developer but is F2P, play Counter Strike Nexon, at least in THAT GAME you'll BE able to play the game in North America. This game looked interesting but like others have said the uninstall button works wonders.			"

												Ok so let's talk a little bit of this game!One day I was looking at free to play games/store and I saw a S.K.I.L.L - Special Force 2 and I thought WOW this look's intresting but I dind't download because I dind't had time.Next day my friend made a steam account and I helped him because he never had steam before,and when account was ready I said to him ""go to store and search for free to play games"" and he did it and he saw a SKILL and started downloading.When downloading was finished we tried to start a game but then Laucher poped up but it's ok we said so we were waiting for another download from Laucher(Why the fu*k should I wait againg when game was downloaded from steam).When Game was downloaded/finished we launched SKILL and it was good.When I came home and opened steam and was looking at free to play games again I saw SKILL and I said ""I could play this game,It look's nice"" and I started downloading it.When Launcher was over with download I started a game,but something was strange,like game doesn""t support 1600x900 resolution it was blurry but I wasn't paying to much attention to resolution because I wanted to see a rest of game,then my friend send me a message to play SKILL so I launched a game and It was fine until cheaters,bugs,glitch,lags or fps drop showed up but I said maybe there are another servers without cheaters etc.,Then my friend said ""Hey Wanna play zombie mod"" and I was like ""Oh yea sure"" and then I was invited to lobby so we started to setup a game but there was only 1 map and I though maybe there would be more maps who knows.So we were playing this game like 2-3 days and it was ok until I realised that it's a repetivie game where you need to buy things/items for real money and then I realised that this is Pay to Win game -_- (I buyed some items and it would last only 7-14 days and I was angry,I was like fu*k you game)Problems:-Bad Resolution(I tried on setting but nothing)-Bad Fps-Glitch-Pay to Win   -95% Pay to Win   -5% Free to PlayI recommed that you better prepare your steam wallet/money because in this game you would need it entire time,or try some other free to play games Im sure there are better games than this....

												I don't really recommend it.If you play with real people then go ahead, you pretty much don't need to buy weapons. I think.It's the poor man's call of duty, don't buy it.All of the weapons cost this weird currency called SP, at the start you earn about 30000 and that is it. BOOM.Gonna have to use steam funds to unlock the other ones. Just don't get it.			"

												Bring backs the memories, but damn is this game P2W. People can know where your at from the corners and most likely prefire you. All just prefire and holding the trigger down with their lmg.  The shop is just ridculous, bunch of VIP weapons only. No wonder Special Force died. I guess they want their Special Force 2 to die as well, if they keep it up with p2w weapons. Maybe, I still play the game when I'm bored. Too early for me say say this game sucks, but if it does, then I won't recommend this game.			"

												I like it. It's better than most other F2P FPS games. The game uses the durability system instead of timed purchases. It's easy to play, kill-time is quick, each weapon requires practice to get used to, it's like the devs took many of the good elements of the popular FPSs, and put them into this game. It's like Counter-Strike and Call of Duty mixed, in a free package. A lot of fun to play. Great graphics, and runs really well on everything maxed, and I'm using a laptop. Highly recommended.			"

Pros:Maps are the exact same from Soldier Front 2Has a clan system and buddy systemLooks like Soldier Front 2There's a cat skin for the M1. I guess that's a pro, if you can stand the game long enough to get it.Cons:Is not as good as SF2 was (huge balance problems)Common to have players with 300-400+ ping, which sucks for those who have <100. 400 PING. IN AN FPS.You can get shot through wallsHitboxes are badGot stuck on black screen after ""tutorial""Tutorial isn't much of a tutorial, it's more of target practice. Teaches you how to crouch jump, doesn't have you swap between primary/secondary or use grenades.Crouch jumping in this game doesn't work very well. Often times it won't work properly.You cannot use the same weapon in multiple loadouts, which means you must have a separate primary and secondary for each loadout.High ranking players can exploit the lobbies and permanently stay in the newbie channels, giving you little chance to progressHackers/aimbotters are also a problemLobby system doesn't have normal wait/ready time, it will instantly go into a match (no prep time) "

												It's ok for your typical Korean F2P shooter fare but with more mainstream graphics and permanent weapons. Plus the starting guns are pretty good making for surprisingly balanced gameplay here. The paid mechanics are a total joke though, first you have to pay for a premium membership and then pay money on top of that to get the cash shop guns, essentially spending money to then spend money. Better off just playing for free as the base guns aren't completely useless.			"

												This is another one of those games, where I could play the hell out of it when I was younger but now that I'm older I now see how bad the game truly is.I'm from North America, so when I heard they where going to be adding North American servers, I was pretty pumped because I played this title a good amount a few years back. But now, I can truly see how bad this game is, and I'll never understand how I could have played this game so much in the past.Lets start off with the currency.. If you're a free player, be ready for a grind! You don't earn credits when completing a match, you have to do challenges to get credits. For example, Kill 50 people with an AR, and in return you will get 50 credits (GP). Guns take any where from 10k+. This is just one of the easy challenges, it gets harder and more annoying. So if your not paying, be ready for a grind and most likely you will be using guns / items you don't even like just to earn credits.Although I wouldn't call this game pay to win, it's very close to being very pay to win.Give the game  a shot, but I promise you won't see anything you haven't already seen in these free to play shooters.

												I would love to leave a positive review for this game, but I'll leave you with an extract from the bee movie script instead :)According to all known lawsof aviation, there is no way a beeshould be able to fly. Its wings are too small to getits fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't carewhat humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow!Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry?- Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening?- I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your fatherpaid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate.We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz.- Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.- Bye! Barry, I told you,stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam.- Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel?- A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school,three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I tooka day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry.- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie?- Yeah. - You going to the funeral?- No, I'm not going. Everybody knows,sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel.Such a hothead. I guess he could havejust gotten out of the way. I love this incorporatingan amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp...under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men.- We are! - Bee-men.- Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oitygraduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your careerat Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennasinside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like?- A little scary. Welcome to Honex,a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee,have worked your whole life to get to the point where youcan work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant PollenJocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected,scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctivegolden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot.- She's my cousin! - She is?- Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right.- At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspectof bee existence. These bees are stress-testinga new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes?- Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement,the Krelman. - What does that do?- Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs aresmall ones. But bees know that every small job,if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the jobyou pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life?I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees,as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?""How can you say that? One job forever?That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only haveto make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could theynever have told us that? Why would you question anything?We're bees. We're the most perfectlyfunctioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe thingswork a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you knowwhat I'm talking about. Please clear the gate.Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!- Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's likeoutside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks!- Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters!You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were.- I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knowswhere, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a PollenJock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollenthan you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol.Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing itand the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies?Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys.- Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerousbeing a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned meagainst a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat,and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my!- I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today,wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patchsix miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh?- Barry! A puddle jump for us,but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am.- You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy?Are you bee enough? I might be. It all dependson what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices.- But you only get one. Do you ever get boreddoing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you justmove it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm.It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad,the more I think about it, maybe the honey fieldjust isn't right for me. You were thinking of what,making balloon animals? That's a bad jobfor a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not surehe wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes.- I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're goinginto honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer?- No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now.I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Geta gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today!- Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobswill be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available?- Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations!Step to the side. - What'd you get?- Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first?- No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open,not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman?- Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See?He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadi			"

												I would love to leave a positive review for this game, but I'll leave you with an extract from the bee movie script instead :)According to all known lawsof aviation, there is no way a beeshould be able to fly. Its wings are too small to getits fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't carewhat humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow!Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry?- Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening?- I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your fatherpaid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate.We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz.- Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.- Bye! Barry, I told you,stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam.- Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel?- A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school,three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I tooka day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry.- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie?- Yeah. - You going to the funeral?- No, I'm not going. Everybody knows,sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel.Such a hothead. I guess he could havejust gotten out of the way. I love this incorporatingan amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp...under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men.- We are! - Bee-men.- Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oitygraduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your careerat Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennasinside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like?- A little scary. Welcome to Honex,a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee,have worked your whole life to get to the point where youcan work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant PollenJocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected,scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctivegolden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot.- She's my cousin! - She is?- Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right.- At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspectof bee existence. These bees are stress-testinga new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes?- Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement,the Krelman. - What does that do?- Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs aresmall ones. But bees know that every small job,if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the jobyou pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life?I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees,as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?""How can you say that? One job forever?That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved.

												A great game for those who are new to FPS genre.Negatives:i feel like it's actually too easy for me (I'm ranked MG2 in CS:GO), aiming down the sights feels pointless, because the recoil on guns isn't very big, and there's also available some kind of armor, that obviously let's you take more damage, and that's quite annoying. Unfortunately the community seems kind of toxic to me, everyone's insulting each other for no apparent reasons (today i was called ""noob"" from one guy, who couldn't kill me from the same camping spot 3 rounds in a row :D).Positives:surprisingly this game is good and very solid, haven't noticed that it would be pay to win, but i do think there are some better guns, that you need a lot of money for to buy/rent them, but i consider it as a reward for players who get invested in the game. There are also interesting new game modes, I haven't seen before, and I've played different FPSs for 10 years, but they sure could use some balancing and tweaks.To sum everything up - I like the game, probably because it requires no effort to play from me, unlike Counter Strike, give it a try ;)			"

												Amongst the pathetic titles that constitute the list of free steam games, this would seem like the kind of game that had noticeable potential. If it wasn't for the fact that ONE CAN'T OPEN THE F@#%KING THING. I tried numerous times to reset, reinstall and reboot the game AND steam, with the only result being the moronic errors the game generated. My point is, don't bother.			"

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

Server is unstable even its empty like♥♥♥♥♥♥I got 100+ ping bump even I live in NewYork. Speedy runner and female character everywhere. Everyone is headshoting everyone by horrible hit mechanic which you aim 1 meter away from his body and somehow your bullets would land on his head-- I dont understand this spray. 300+ ping dude tried to wreck everyone with sniperifle rushing and work almost every fuuking time by no scope, I guess he had a dot on center of sceen.

												Alright after playing this game for a few hours i gotta say that i will never recommend something like this ever again.  This Game is a free to paly CoD like shooter that strives to be competitive but will never be.  It runs completely on p2p and even on 50 letency it straight up lags like♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you dont mind lag and dieing for no reason at all then you wont mind this but as a person that know how to play shooters this is infuriating.  This game has horrible coding. rawinput is nowhere to be seen and you will always have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cheesy control over your aim. Since this is free to play i will completely ignore tha obvious unbalacedness of weapons.The map layouts on many maps is like in cod built to be good at as many modes as possible and this makes search and destroy unplayable.

I can give you an advice to not install this game, and dont try it out, as i said!!! I can say just one big reason: Hitboxes! They doesnt exists in this game, as far as i could see. You should at your enemy, but the bullets dont hit. Then you see how your enemy killed you: He shoulds FAR next to you, but get the kill. Thats simply it. DONT TRY IT OUT! "

												dame, ppl with an hour in the game are calling it badBeing a person who doesnt mind spending some of le dolla in games(so long as its worth it) i dont feel that people should judge the game so harshlyf2p games are ment to have real money shops so that their game isntplayed with nothing in return,of course you can grind it out like i did on my nexon account, or just spend money to have more fun fast.Just because you cant afford or cant be ""bothered"" spending money in a game then thats your problem not the communities.

												I can't tell if I like this game or hate it. The movement feels solid, but I don't like how you stop for a second if you change weapons. Also, the crouch-jumpo thing is completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and they should really just keep crouch jumping to what it is instead of pressing them both at the same time with the smallest window of opportunity to actually jump a centimetre higher than usual to actually get onto something that you should just be able to normally jump onto. The hitboxes in this game are appalling. Someone can shoot about 3 metres to the left of an enemy and still hit them. The only time the hitboxes actually work is when you're using a sniper rifle, which puts people who like to use snipers at a huge disadvantage in normal game modes. It's a shame, because sniping in this game feels extremely solid and a lot of fun. It really feels rewarding when you get a good kill. If they could improve on the things I've mentioned, then I would definitely play it a lot more.			"

												From 2 hours of playing, it is a pretty good game. It isn't as P2W as many make out, from what I can see VIP members get a 5% damage boost and 5% recoil reducuction, which isn't really that bad. I haven't noticed someone on top of the game being a VIP, my biggest problem is the recoil on some of the weapons, and close combat feels really chunky and not nice. Medium to long range is good if you can hit them though.If you want a free game similar to Counter Strike while also being unique to its self, get this, if you're looking for a well polished game that works flawlessly, get something else.editAfter 15 hours, you can notice some of the VIP's having a slight advantage with the 5% damage buff, but it isn't much, and the community is a problem, as if someone is doing good everyone jumps on the hacking bandwagon.

The maps changed regularly, Some of the maps have the same layout but with different textures and colours, it gives it a different fell to each map. I like it and it's worth a try in my eye's.

But of course the cons are some of the Disadvantages to a person who hasnt payed any cash into the game, The clothes, some of the weapons and some of the secondaries, But it still wont affect you its just a bit more unfair than the normal weapons...Still a pretty nice game expecially for a free to play			"

												First of all I will put the review in 3 parts Game design, Monetization and Performance Game design The game have done many things wrong 1- The maps are numerous but extreemly small, it is not unlickely that you will kill someone right after they spawn as the spawn protection have very limited duration 2- Snipers are too strong as most of the time you will die from one hit while walking does not affect the sniper accuracy at all 3- The game have an aim feature but made it useless by making hipfire almost as accurate and much easier to useMonetization The game have two ways to spend real money in it 1- Buy a VIP account 2- Buy Items and some of those can not be bought with currency earned in game 3- Buy a special weapon paint that allows you to have 5% more damage and 5% less recoil  The VIP account allows you to play in VIP only servers and some game modes are locked to VIP only matches.Performance The published requirments are quite low but I had problems with freezing every once in a while and this thing can break the game if you freeze in front of an enemy which happens alot, I googled it and it seems other people have the same problem, so I put it in the discussions on steam and no body have fix so far.

												For those who have not played Soldier Front 2, this is exactly the same game. Unfortunately there were too many hackers and gradually developed into a Pay to Win game, thus players decreased resulting the game to shut down. Search up ""Soldier Front 2"" in steam, it's still there and you can download it but it will not start. In my theory, I don't think this game will survive, for it will suffer the same fate like its duplicate.			"

												Being a glutton for punishment and not being particularly good at FPS, I thought I'd give this one a go as it was free and I had nothing to lose (except some more of my self esteem), but surprisingly enough I seem to be decent enough at it. The game is pretty standard stuff, shoot the people that's not in the same team as you. It has your standard rounds like team deathmatch and quite often (at least in my experience) there are some people willing to help out the newer players. On the negative side there is quite a few people who camp right next to spawn areas and it takes a good few deaths before you turn up in another spawn area where people haven't set a tent with a cup of tea waiting to welcome you with a gun, but overall it's a good time killer and finally an FPS where my kill to death ratio isn't 1:10000* a game.* it's 2:10000			"

												The game is not perfectly balanced, but it is quite near being balanced. If you hate snipers in general, then you will flip out playing this game.But aside these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ snipers, the game is quite neato, it currently has some of the more iconic gamemodes.The weapons aren't that hard to get, and the recoil on the guns is kinda forgiving like in COD. (It is still better than COD though)Overall, this game is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing fun.8/10 Would buy 2 weapons from the start again.			"

												I had much more fun playing this on my game pad than I did playing counter strike go on the 360 .. This maybe my fav free fps to date and I was never a real big fan of counter strikes or TF2 but really enjoyed my 1st night on this game .. I was killed a bit more for using a pad .. But if like me u do like to chill back on a pad I have played far worse games than this . Used xpadder & i use [ & ] as my joystici in buttons .. On S.K.I.L.L these buttons increase & decrease mouse movment which was cool being able to adjust my pad movment in play depending on my aproach :)  .. Give it a try  .. PS  u get enough money to instantly load up with a good gun but I wouldnt bother for an hour as the 1st gun does get some kills in and when u leave they gift u  pack 1 2 or 3 and there is a nicer gun in each pack .. So get this 1st then go to the store later PEACE :)  Almost making me want to train my mouse keyboard skills back up so must be a good game  lol  and GFX and gameplay are all very nice indeed			"

												Just hit 100 hours of gameplay, Its a great game (especially for a free to play). These are my opinions/reasons:Great Graphics (doesnt need the best pc in the world either) Its not Pay to win (trust me, all the things that cost real money is optional, it doesnt give a huge advantage)Awesome People (we are all friends however that doesnt mean you wont see people saying ""Noob"" ""Knife Noob"" (espeically in point/round battle)So many gamemodes (a really cool thing is that in gamemodes like Sniper Point/Round, If you do not have a sniper it will let you use a weapon called ""CZ700 (Low rank)"" so you dont need any requirements to play sniper, the same with shotgun team death match, you get a weapon to use aswell :DClans (You can join and create clans, cool thing is, when your starting a game it shows the current top 10 clans)and so much more!I dont really have any cons, when i found out about this game i was so amazed and i got addicted to playing it xD all my friends joined and because this game was so good i even bought stuff.I hope this helped!Have a good day!CalloPlayz (You can request me to be friends too :D) "

												A fps for the more casual player. Battlefield-ish. Cheap but all is very logical and easy to get used to. A variety of decent maps. A good selection of modes and weapons. The community is ok. Gameplay-wise it can get quite hectic depending on the map size to player ratio but it's quick entertainment. There is no pay to win element. Or if there is, I didn't experience it. If on one map you encounter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t players then just pick another one. It's as simple as that. If you have no money and want to play a fps game then look no further. Actually I'd recommend this even if you have tons of money and are looking for a great multiplayer game.			"

												Very easy to master, great for Call Of Duty fans and also for Counter Strike fans. Why? Because you can quickscope everytime you panic, you can actually trickshot if you're accurate. On the CS hand, bomb planting mode and seizure mode is awesome. Nice ""step"" sounds and effects. Oh and you're ♥♥♥♥ed if you're not the first to shoot, or at least try to hit them in the head, otherwise it takes more bullets to kill them.			"

												From my point of view, I like it. Its not a buy to win, decent graphics and fun. The only problem is that its close becoming a dead game, not a lot of people play it so I would recommend  playing during Friday through Sunday. Overall its good.			"

												Wouldn't launch the first 3 times I tried. Then this pearl ""some might call next-gen"" of a Free-to-play gem finally started up. First things that meets you once you are through the horrible and non-what-so-ever-explanatory excuse for a tutorial? A market place where everything but the two (yes TWO!) basic weapons has to be bought. You can only choose one out of the two starter weapons of course... no need to confuse people. Besides from that, there are bits and pieces where you can brush up on your Russian, because they haven't bothered translating it. 10/10 would uninstall every day of the week.			"

												the game is a generic as they come and go, nothing really stands out, the game as a frustrating unlock system for the most part you get enough cash to get any gun you want (go for either K2 or SSG or the ohk sniper rifle) that said the game gets old quick, it feels very very outdated grafics and gameplay wise, hell even cs 1.6 the shooting feels betterthe game is suprisignly bloody, and it does have a good variety of maps but they are all very cramped, you can have some fun with it but you cant really get very skilled at this game because of how stupid accurate the guns are(they could very well be lazer guns) and the skins for the guns are by far one of the ugliest i have ever seen, also looking up info for this game for more indept stats is really hard and i think it might because the game has 2 names for some reason.over all if you have played military shooters before chances are they beat this one by a fair margin, that said this game is a pretty good start for new shooter players because how simple the shooting feels(quite literally point and shoot),if you are willing to something like 10$ on this game you are honestly better off buying CS GO, it looks better and it runs better, and most important IT PLAYS better.TL;DR:it's meh, it not bad, but it's not great either, if you have played other military shooters before forget about this one			"

												S.K.I.L.L. - Special Force 2 is a valid free-to-play shooter which puts a lot of emphasis on community and clans. Even if it's not the best shooter around regarding graphics and sounds, it manages to offer a complete and fun overall gameplay experience and some pretty unique and fun game modes. With its simple graphics and solid mechanics, combined with a fair in-game shop and a complete clan system, the game has the right tools to offer a nice competitive scene for hardcore players and an enjoyable environment for new players as well.
