												EDIT: The developer got into contact with me after I posted this review and clarified that this game is actually more of a test than a set of fully working minigames.  He also asked more about problems that I had, showing that he really cares about the game.  I'm changing this review to positive, but know that the minigames are in a VERY rough shape at the moment, and that they exist more as concepts to try for a couple of minutes rather than games to play for any real length of time, which I do think could be made more clear on the store page.  I'll leave my previous review below just for reference.I didn't want to be ""that guy"" that reviews a free game as being bad, but honestly, there's just nothing to this game.  Ignoring future updates, there is zero reason for me to play it again, and that's after 19 minutes of playing (most of which were spent seeing how broken the archery mode was or trying to get teleporting to work).First thing first, teleporting didn't work until I restarted the game...  Not a good sign.The goalie mode works.  Three cannons shoot balls at your net, and you use giant hands on poles to protect your goal.  Nothing wrong with it, it's just not particularly exciting.The drone fighting mode might have potential.  Currently, it feels like Space Pirate Trainer if it had been made by one person in a single day.  The gun doesn't have sights, the sword bounces lasers in random directions, and the drones' flight patterns are just weird...  I mean, it's playable, it's just not fun.The archery mode...  Wow.  The bow kinda works, except that the arrow always looks fully drawn.  The enemies can find you and walk towards you.  You can teleport as much as you want, meaning that there is no reason for you to ever die.  On top of that, I quickly found a spot up high to teleport to that made me invincible, completely breaking the (already quite broken) game...  Oh, and a slight touch from your bow will instantly kill the enemies, meaning that there's really no meaning to even shooting them.The biggest problem that plagued all three minigames was that there was NO haptic feedback.  Literally every other Vive game I have ever played (including other freebies) has had haptic feedback.  To block a goal, blast a drone, or shoot a bow with zero haptic feedback just feels so very wrong.I get it.  It's a free game that's possibly made by a single person.  However, putting another obviously incomplete game on Steam is only hurting the Vive (I see people dissing the Vive all the time because all they see is shovelware).  If this game was marked as early access, I'd wait to write my review.  With it NOT being early access, though, I don't feel like I'm in the wrong for calling it out for what it is.  Giving the game a positive review JUST for being free isn't helping anyone.  I downloaded it after looking at the good ratings (which I realize all just basically say ""it's free!""), and I just feel lied to.  Mark the game as early access or get it to a MUCH more playable state and I could see myself enjoying it and giving it a positive review.			"

												Interesting mini-games. For me the best part is playing the archery game but then escaping out of the main building. The buildings are huge on the outside and have very interesting architecture. I love jumping all over them and trying to reach the highest spots.			"

												10/10, specifically for the archery game -- and not even for the archery part. Nothing eases stress like smacking robots clear across the map with your bow.EDIT: I feel as though I should clarify. The enemy robots collide with the bow in a realistic manner, meaning you can sweep their legs out from under them, fling them into the air, or just smack 'em in the head. Truly a visceral experience, and one that I haven't seen in any other VR game.			"

												This is the unlimited lightsaber experience that Trials on Tatooine isn't, packaged with a intense take on Longbow from The Lab and a soccer minigame, all for free. This isn't saying that it's merely worth the price, this is a steal.If you like the Trials on Tatooine segment but don't want to sit through cutscenes and button pushing, this is for you. It's similar to Space Pirate Trainer with a lightsaber instead of a shield.As much as I wanted a good lightsaber game, I was more impressed with the bow game. While still fairly simple in game mechanics, it was fun warding off different types of enemies coming from different directions. I love Longbow, but the added element of being personally attacked and defending yourself is awesome.There's also another game, where you use hands on long sticks to defend a soccer goal. Pretty good, interesting mechanic.Update! There's now a 4th minigame demo, which is amazing. Think of something like a Raw Data shooter or something like the Time Crisis arcade game. It's an amazing start with just the basics implemented so far, and I'm eager to see how this develops.			"

												I've been waiting for this game to come out since I saw it on Steam, and I definitely recommend giving it a quick play. There are currently only 3 minigames, as follows:- shoot drones flying at you and deflect their bullets with a light saber. Not much else to say about this. - block soccer balls from getting into your goal using two giant hands (this gets pretty difficult pretty fast imo)-  a Holopoint-style bow game where you shoot robots before they get to youAll of them increase in difficulty over time and are pretty fun for a bit. The only problems I can see so far are that the resolution seems a little low, which I guess is fine especially if you're on a lower system, and the Holopoint-esque game seems to have a bug where enemies can't hit you when you're looking at them.Oh, and the way you add arrows to your bow makes you want to clash your controllers together. Updating this review and sacrificing the ratings it has because the game is now $10, rather than free. The developer is kind of pushing it at this price, and though it's a bit of fun I certainly wouldn't pay more than 5.			"

												This game is awesome so far!  Out of the 45 minutes of game time about 30-40 minutes of that was the bow fighting game alone.  First off let me say I am more than pleased that you guys did archery right.  Second, I felt like a serious badass killing those robots.  BUT, it was too easy.  I feel it could be improved if the enemies could move faster and attack faster after a certain point because by 700 I would seriously expect them to be in a full sprint to try to kill me.  The other two were actually quite challenging and also very fun. I would totally recommend this game!TLDR: They did archery like the lab, but the bow game needs to be harder. Overall 10/10			"

												This gem is amazing! There are three game modes as of now. The first two are kind of boring. The third is bow and arrow against evil enemies. Then I discovered the ability to teleport to ledges above and below, making it sort of VR's Mirror's Edge.			"

												Good start, particularly for a free game.  There are parts that could use a little improvement, but can't argue with the price.  This is like an indie version of The Lab, so don't expect any depth... Just a few fun arcade-style games.(Careful with the ""teleport"", though.  Hopefully he'll change it, but for now it could make you nauseous if you overuse it)			"

												Oh man, The potential is real. The game is definitely rough, not a surpsirse with most VR games.I would give it a poor rating if it didnt have ""last stand""The freedom of movement, ability to slow time, and the ability to knock NPCs into the air and swipe their feet from under them is just what the Lab's bow and arrow game lacked.  Hours of fun! However, the bow mechanics are by far the worst there is to offer in all VR games that try to replicate the Lab's bow and arrow game. In the end, still playable and still fun. I'd happily pay a price for the game when things are smoothed out with more content. Overall:Graphics: 5/10Gameplay: 7/10			"

They were easy to exploit, and the fact that the lobby is so barren is unfortunate.

												Good :- I don't like teleportation mechanics, but I do like how the teleportation-dash mechanics are now handled in the bow game.- Says there's a Windows 10 requirement, but works fine on my Windows 7-64bit.Bad :- Although Touch controllers are now supported, whatever you hold still points 90° downwards, this is true on all 3 games but specially obvious in the bow game. Maybe this is only a Windows 7 issue ?			"

												I really liked these games - the football hands game is  unusual but really fun ( own goals aside :) The space shooter is pretty neat but the really immersive robot attack had me ****ing meself - especially when they creep up on you! Oh and then i teleported through a wall into the outside!! ****!. I think its better to teleport using the fadeout mechanic - being 'thrown' across a big room is freaky!!I killed all the robots - they ran out sadly and I had to come out! - would love to see a big end of level boss!A 3d berserk? Really nice work on the robots though - very satisfying to sweep the legs! All in all...A great test bed of games! loving it!			"

A half-decent tech demo for roomscale... and it's free.VR Multigames is free, but it is honestly worth a few bucks for the variety you get here.  It's a nice demo for computers which can't get The Lab to run smoothly or can't get The Lab to load quickly enough.  I mean, there's not much loading time to wait through in VR Multigames.  It's not nearly as pretty or as immersive or as easy to navigate as The Lab, but it doesn't look terrible, especially in the archery/melee combat scene.That said, this variety pack doesn't do one game mode perfectly and has a lot of issues which prevent fun from happening.  Between glitches and bad UIs, you'll also witness missing or non-functional features.  Scores won't go up in some game modes.  Many of the game modes have yet to be created, but the developer seems very passionate about this pack judging from how quickly the archery demo was improved.  Overall, I think this is a game pack worth trying for yourself.			"
