								Interesting concept, and well worth the $8.50. Its surprisingly polished and has a good amount of mini games. I cant wait to see what more they add to it			"

								I just saw this game on Steam for $10 and thought ""hey, I love VR archery, and these are the same guys that made the Selfie Tennis game that everyone loved!""  So, I picked it up and played all of the different modes.You've got a few different archery games to choose from.  Archery cooking, archery ice cream stand, archery newspaper delivery, rooftop target archery, and factory worker archery (I think that's all of them).  Considering that this game is in early access and that it's only $10, that's not a bad selection!  I personally like newspaper delivery archery, which even contains minigames within itself.The bow mechanics feel very good.  It has ""true"" 2-handed archery (you aim with both hands, not just the front hand), and the rumble makes pulling the string very satisfying.  There are leaderboards for each mode, so you can shoot for the high score of your favorite mode(s)!Being a huge fan of VR archery, I'd say that this game was worth it for me.  With more content supposedly on the way for a game that isn't even very expensive, there isn't much to complain about!			"

								#Archery is a mini-game compilation that features archery mechanics. While the graphic is simple, what's fun is its highly interactive environment (in the sense that you can fire an arrow at them for additional point). There are about 5 mini-games, each featuring simple gameplay objective. The game doesn't give you any instruction before you start the mini-game though, so you'll have to figure it out yourself on what they are. Some of the mini-games may even features their own mini (but even shallower) game too, and to play them you have to fire an arrow at their icon).This title is in early access, and provide bit-size fun. I don't have a problem aiming and firing the arrows in all the mini games (except the rooftop target board mini game) too.All in all, this title is an easy to pick up title for VR beginner to play, and should provide casual fun, but it need more contents (mini games) ASAP.

								A simple game that is fun to play. Not sure how long I will play it for, mind. Various game play scenarios try and add a bit of variety but, at the end of the day, you're just firing a bow and arrow. On the plus side, it is better than most other offerings out there and expands on similar style found in The Lab's bow and arrow game. Personal favourite is the ice-cream level, followed by the ""paperboy"" level. Additional mini-games, found within the games, are mostly fun with only a couple of duds in there. Worth picking up if you have nothing else to play and fancy bow and arrow shooting.			"

								I liked selfie tennis and after messing around with the archery in there i was mostly hoping for an environment to shhot around in and unlock stuff. That isnt in this game. It does have a bunch of shooting courses (which are pretty hard if you arent great at vr archery) but the environments there are destructable and there are fun mini games to find. And the controls are on par with other vr archery games. Im recommending it mostly off of style but if they added a training stage or just a more passive shooting around stage it would be amazing			"

								Simple enough, but absolutely 0 instruction is off putting. Suffers from the same flaws as #SelfieTennis I'm afraid. Also seems to look worse, I just wanted to increase resolution scaling or something to sharpen it up but once again this game has absolutely no options or menu system and I'm not going to go digging through forums or using 3rd party solutions to improve the experience.
